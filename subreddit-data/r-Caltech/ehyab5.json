    "postText": "Hi! I'm super excited to have been accepted to Caltech for early action. I'm having a difficult time making up my mind, and I had some reservations about Caltech due to the mixed things I read on the internet. :( Could you guys give me some advice, and perhaps answer some questions I had?\n\n1. Mental health? I read on a random thread from a while back that depression was pretty widespread at Caltech. Is this true? Do you guys think that someone with preexisting mental health issues would heavily suffer at Caltech? I'm usually a very bubbly and extroverted type of girl. However, I unfortunately have some issues with cutting. I am genuinely working on improving my mental health, and I am planning to seek help soon, but mental health was one of the reasons I felt unsure about Tech.\n2. The rigor? Is the work at Caltech \"do-able\" with hard work? I've read in many places that Caltech is genuinely a humbling experience. Personally, I don't really consider myself the smartest in school. I've met far more people who are smarter in my high school journey. Although I did well in my IB program and had good test scores, I'm much more of the \"hard-working type\" than the \"naturally smart type\" (if that makes sense). I'm more than ready to be humbled by my brilliant peers, but I'm honestly worried: Will a hardworking student who is not the typical \"genius\" type be okay at Tech? Sometimes, it seems like Caltech is a place for geniuses, and I feel quite intimidated.\n3. Not having free time? On average, how much sleep does a Caltech student get? How much free time did/do you guys have?\n4. Fitting in? At Caltech, would I still be able to find people who are pretty chill and down to earth? I was a little intimidated by how \"nerdy\" some of the kids I met on the accepted student discord were, haha.\n5. Social life? Do you still find time to socialize with others? Also, coming from a very small town in the south, I love that Caltech is near LA. Do you have time to explore LA and to go into the city?\n6. Do you regret it? Do you regret choosing Caltech?\n\nThank you guys so much for taking time to read through my questions!! &lt;3 If you guys could give me some advice and help a high school senior out, it would absolutely mean so much to me!! :)",

            "comment": "Caltech is a pressure cooker.  But if you were fearless enough to apply and the selection committee gave  you early acceptance, you're probably okay.\n\n1.  Seek help now.  There's no shame in getting counseling.  Tech is tough - but the entire transition to college life is tough.  They cover a bunch in frosh camp, and I still remember this: Caltech takes the top 2% of the country.  So even if you're not in the top half, you're still in the top 2%.   \n\n2. It depends.  If you get by now in high school by ONLY doing hard work, you're going to have an even rougher time.  It's okay if you're not the smartest - EVERYONE has to bust ass at Tech.  But you do need some natural ability also.  There simply aren't enough hours in the day if your main mode is to power through something.  You need some natural aptitude as well.  Again though - you got accepted.  You'll also get an evaluation so they can place you properly.\n\n3. It depends.  Sleep, grades, social life - pick 2.  I did the EE major, and junior year was rough.  Pulling overnighters 3-4 times a week was common.  But again, it really depends.\n\n4. You will probably do fine.  There's a wide range, but most people at Caltech are fairly normal imo.  \n\n5. The House system is pretty good, even if it has been watered down... (that's just us crotchety old alums talking)  But each House has its own flavor, despite them \"all being fine Houses\".  Downtown LA is a good half hour by car away.  West side (UCLA, Westwood) like 45 minutes.  It's totally doable to get out there if you want - but you need a car (it's LA).  Pasadena is pretty nice and you probably don't even need to go to LA really.\n\n6. No way.  That Tech cred goes a long way - but you still need to bust ass and get good grades.  Plus I've made life long friends and connections that are pretty bad ass.  While you're doing it, it'll be painful.  (\"Caltech is a great place to be from, but not a great place to be at\") \n\nYou are not the first person to have these issues.  Caltech is notorious for being a pressure cooker and they've worked hard for many years to be more supportive.  Could it be better?  Yes - but there are systems in place and things are designed to make the transition better.  Hell, your first two terms (out of 3 per year) are pass/fail to help.\n\nAlso, not being the genius in the class may be beneficial to your mental health.  There are many stories of folks who were \"big fish in a small pond\" - they came from a small town and were top of their class for their entire lives.  Then they get to Tech and they're just average and they can't handle it and short circuit.  (No one at Tech is going to be the best at EVERYTHING)\n\nYou may want to check out prefrosh weekend too.",

            "comment": " Here's my opinion as a frosh so far this year.\n\n1. I don't think I'm qualified to answer this. However, at orientation, the admin had a lot of emphasis on seeking help. There are also peer advocates and residential associates who are always willing to help and talk with you.\n2. Not everyone at Caltech is a \"genius,\" because I certainly am not one. I was still able to earn great shadow grades and have adequate social life. Some people are good at different subjects, some are average in most subjects; however, nobody judges you for it. Caltech (so far) is very doable with hard-work; natural talents will help make it easier but is by no means required. The most important thing you have to realize is, that it is **OK to ask for help** from your peers or go to office hours. You'll save a lot of frustrations and learn even faster than just banging your head against a set.\n3. I get about 7-8 hours of sleep each night. I usually sleep around 2 AM to 9 AM.\n4. There are some nerdy people, there are some not-very-nerdy people. If you got accepted, you will certainly find a group of friends who are as nerdy or not as nerdy as you want them to be. Everyone has their quirks and it's fun getting to know people.\n5. I have plenty of time to socialize. You will very quickly realize that your socialization time will blend into your collaborative homework time. Besides that, my free time is taken up by house events and the like.\n6. Nah, I have a pretty positive experience with Caltech so far.\n\nIf you can, you should come to the Pre-Frosh weekend! It's how I know I wanted to be at Caltech.",

            "comment": "1. I\u2019m pretty neurotypical so I\u2019ll leave this part to someone who can answer better\n\n2. Yes Caltech is hard, however I think someone who had to work hard in high school will actually be better off than someone who didnt. I had a pretty easy time in high school (by no means a genius though I do know some at Caltech now) and it took me most of frosh and smore year to really learn how to work hard and do good. Hard work is more important than genius in my opinion\n\n3. I get 8hrs of sleep a night and still have some amount of free time. Caltech is what you make of it, I personally choose a slightly lighter course load (40ish units/about 4 classes) and am much happier with that. I know people though who like to have lots of work and no free time. If sleep or socializing or some other extra curricular is important, then there are ways to make it work if you put in the effort.\n\n4. There is a wide range of people at tech. If your discord is anything like my classes groupme then its just the bias of the nerdiest people being the talkative ones. Im sure youll meet plenty of people you fit in with if you come here\n\n5. I have plenty of time to socialize. Esp with the house system, I feel like its very easy to socialize in the time between other things since everyone is so close. As for going into LA; Again, if you want to have time to go into LA, you\u2019ll find the time for it. I personally almost never leave campus but thats my preference.\n\n6. I don\u2019t regret going to Caltech. I met some of my closest friends (though I\u2019m sure that would be true of any school). On the other hand, I think I would have had an easier time at a state school as well as a slightly higher GPA. Theres a balance between the prestige of Caltech and the work it takes to be here and its impossible to know if I would have been happier/more successful anywhere else",

            "comment": "Current freshman, so I only have 1 term of experience here, but so far it has been awesome.\n\n1: I am not totally sure about this as I do not personally have a lot of experience. However, during orientation they told us that there are a lot of mental health resources here. Also, since it is such a small school, I feel like everyone really looks out for each other, and I have felt like upperclassmen especially are super helpful and supportive of new freshman as we transitioned to college.\n\n2: Yes, Caltech is very challenging academically. However, the work is totally doable. Hard work, time management, and making use of resources are the key. I think that resources is a big one - so far I have had several times in multiple classes where I felt completely confused and lost, but by going to office hours and using upperclassmen tutors I was able to get through it and learn the material very well.  Honestly, I think that of being either \u201chard working type\u201d or \u201cgenius type\u201d, hard working is much more important at caltech, as nobody who comes in knows everything that they are trying to teach us, and I think it is totally doable if you are willing to work hard to get it done.\n\n3: There is definitely less free time at Caltech than at other schools, but I don\u2019t really feel bothered by this. Most people that I know are in a club or a few. Lots of people find time to play musical instruments, go to the gym, cook, and stuff like that. I will say that I have not explored LA as much as I would have like to yet, as I have only gone into the city twice so far. I typically get 7 or 8 hours of sleep per night. \n\n4: I would say don\u2019t worry about this one too much. I was concerned as well before o chose Caltech that everyone would just be super nerdy and not socially adapted, but I have found this to be not the case at all! Yes, most everyone here is passionate about stem, but people also have lots of other passions and many are super sociable and fun. Also, I definitely would say don\u2019t base your impression of your incoming class off of the people who are active on the group chats, there is some major selection bias there. Also, I think that the house system is a wonderful thing that helped me and a lot of others to find the people that we really clicked with.\n\n5: Again, I think that the house system is a great way to have an initial social group, and to find people who may have similar interests to you. For me right now, most of my social group is people who live in the same house as me. Also, one thing I love about Caltech is that it is super easy to make friends with people who are in all different grade levels, and you are not isolated to only hanging out with other freshman. I would say that I feel like I have a lot of time to socialize with others, and almost all of the times when I have stayed up later than I wanted to was because I was just hanging out, and not because I was scrambling to finish a homework set. \n\n6: Not at all! Although it has only been one term so far, I love being at Caltech and I am so happy that I chose to come here.\n\nFeel free to pm me if you have more specific questions, I\u2019d be happy to answer them.",

            "comment": "First off congratulations. I started as a freshman at Caltech in 1985. I have basically been on one university campus or another since then ( I am a professor at a big state school). \n\n1. By all means do what you have to to keep yourself healthy. College is a big transition and will be regardless of where you go. Caltech might have more stressors. It is also a small community and might provide more support. Mental health support for undergrads at my school is a joke: 40,000+ undergraduate students and one counselor. \n\n2. I have seen a couple of contradictory answers here. I am firmly of the opinion that the people who struggled the most at Tech were the people who just skated through high school without having to work. You are smart enough to do this: if you have good work habits you will be fine. I did not and had to learn them.\n\n3. I feel like there was free time. There were certainly some all-nighters and times like finals week where things were pretty intense, but it was certainly not like the whole quarter was like that, or even most of it. \n\n4. It is a small community, and the house system provides kind of a natural social group. Your discord experience reminded me of a freshman barbeque I went to the day I arrived. I ended up in this group of the most pretentious nerds I have ever run across. Every one of them was talking about all the advanced classes they'd taken in high school, and I was just thinking to myself \"Geaddaddy what the f**k did you come here for?\" But in a day or two I met some people and started to find people I got along with and never looked back. These kinds of people are around, and tend to be the first thing you notice, but I dont think that most Techers are like this. \n\n5. I had time to socialize and to see the city. It helps to either have a car or a friend with a car. I dated someone who lived in LA proper most of my sophomore year, so I spent almost every weekend there that year. Most of the rest of the time LA was an occasional destination, but it is certainly something that you can do. Pasadena is great too though. Old Town was kind of a dump when I first arrived but by my senior year it was really a hip destination. If you like architecture Pasadena gas a higher density of craftsman style bungalows than anywhere else. \n\n6. No way. I loved it there. No regerts at all.\n\nIt seems to me like you are asking two questions here. \"Can I do it?\" and \"Should I do it?\" The answer to the first is yes. You got in. You are smart enough: if you apply yourself you can do it. The answer to the second is more complicated.  If you are sure that you want to do something in math, science or engineering then I feel that there is no place better in the world to be a student. If you are not sure if you want to go into STEM then it might not be the right choice. \n\nPlease tell us what you decide! Where else are you thinking of?",

Your chances are best if you get help early and stick with it. The school's counseling center is an invaluable resource, but mostly as a stepping stone to a permanent therapist.\n\n2. This is the most difficult program you can find. Hard work will get you far, but building a good study group and getting help when you need it will be crucial to not getting buried. Find people whose work habits are similar to yours.\n\n3. *Ha*\n\n4. There are all kinds of people here. Pretty much everyone describes themselves as \"chill\", so don't focus on that as a useful term. Ask them how they spend their time and try to find common ground.\n\n5.

Despite that, I have an active social life and spend plenty of time with friends, even if one or both of us is working at the time.\n\n6. Never, but sometimes I want to give up.",

My guess is that the combination of selection effects and generic college stressors are a bigger factor here than anything unique to the environment at Caltech, but I have no data to back that up. The counseling center is free for students, but your mileage may vary as to the quality.\n2. Depends on what you mean by 'hardworking' and 'be ok'- and, frankly, on your major. You're not going to be able to get perfect grades taking a full load as a EE while working the number of hours your classes say you should have to work whether you're a genius or not. But most people at Tech are not geniuses, and nonetheless almost everyone graduates- and most of those who don't *could,* but have decided (entirely reasonably) that it's not worth it for them.\n3. Sleep is hugely variable. I knew people who slept four hours a night. I knew people who slept from 11:30-8:00 every single day. I knew people who slept whenever they felt like it, for however long they felt like. In any given term, almost everyone probably had at least one week with almost no work, and one week where they were working near-continuously, but most people, most of the time, had at least a few hours of free time per day. \n4. Yeah, the prefrosh pages are like that. Most people aren't, and most of the ones who are snap out of it over the course of frosh year.\n5. I got much more social interaction than I did in high school. LA is an enormous pain to get around, even with a car. \n6. No, absolutely not.",

            "comment": "First off, congratulations on being accepted to Caltech!\n\n1. I can't speak for how Caltech is now, but from my ancient experience of being there in the 90s, there has always been a lot of informal support from other students. I can't say whether you'd suffer greatly or not, but make sure you take advantage of the resources Caltech has in terms of mental health.\n2. It's generally do-able, and it requires hard work. There are support structures in place, primarily for the core curriculum: Use them! Go to recitation section, go to office hours when you need them. There are true geniuses at Caltech, but you soon learn that they have limits to their genius, and there are things that are difficult for them. One way or another, Caltech will make you work hard, genius or not.\n3. It depends, but you'll generally sleep less as you progress, with the general sleep minimum being in junior year, where your option's meatiest courses are typically scheduled. In general, Techers don't have much free time. There's a reason you don't typically see Caltech doing well at events you might expect Caltech students to do really well at (e.g. robot competitions, trivia bowls, other collegiate contests), and that's simply a lack of time and brain budget.\n4. It's a nerd school and it's small. That said, there's generally always a range, and the main point of the House system is to help you fit in. Don't worry about what you see in the discord, as incoming students typically want to flex their nerd credentials like some sort of nerd peacock. It's surprising that at such a tiny school, you'll generally find your tribe.\n5. Yes. You can have a social life. Is it going to be wild parties every weekend, filled with beautiful people? No. But, you and your fellow students will spend a lot of time with each other, and you'll likely have a lot of social interactions that occur spontaneously. Coming from a small town, LA in general can be intimidating. It's a place where the stereotypes can be very powerful, and you have to work a bit to find things that vibe with you. This is a region of the world where if you want to do some activity, it's probably available to do here.\n6. I don't regret it, but it is not a school for everyone. I think that you should at least hear, and understand later, that Caltech is first and foremost a research institution. Undergraduate education is likely lower on the Institute's priority list than sorting out faculty parking. That said, if there's some science/engineering/nerdy thing you want to learn, Caltech offers unique opportunities to learn from some of the very best. They were hired as researchers, not teachers, but most are pretty friendly and happy to pass their wisdom on. You'll know/hear quickly who those are and are not.\n\nAgain, congratulations on being accepted, I hope you come to Caltech!",

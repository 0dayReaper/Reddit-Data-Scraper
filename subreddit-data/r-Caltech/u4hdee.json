They're offering a 10% scholarship that really just seems like something everyone gets, and they seem pretty desperate to get people admitted. They waived around this 7% admission rate for the bootcamp that I highly doubt is accurate. To me it seems like a great bootcamp at an good value from a reputable source, but I was wondering what some students here thought of it. \n\nSome background on myself: \n\nI am a current teacher looking to teach computer science at public high schools. I want to fast track my way into becoming proficient enough to teach foundations to high school students and pass my credentialing exam. I'd also like to get into education administration one day and use a data science background within that position. How well do you think this bootcamp aligns with my career goals?",

            "comment": "One note, data science and computer science, while similar, don't overlap as much as you'd think. I strongly suspect that a lot of the theory part of CS (like object oriented programming, algorithm design, etc) would be mostly omitted or just given to you instead of throughly taught during a course like this. If you want to teach CS, taking some online courses in CS specifically would be a much more effective way to learn the basics needed to teach it. On the other hand, for educational administration or something that's actually a data science role, this bootcamp could be useful if a bit overkill. \n\nPersonally, I think your analysis that it's being upsold a lot with the brand names is correct, as I've never heard of this program before your post, and it almost certainly doesn't cross over much with Caltech the institution. The faculty might be employed by Caltech, but I don't think they're the same professors that teach here.",

    "postText": "Hey all. I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley and always dreamed of going to Caltech for college. I think I may have had some undiagnosed ADHD and some social difficulties which resulted in me doing poorly in middle school and high school (3.8 unweighted, 1510 on my SAT). Didn\u2019t even apply because I knew I would get denied. I attended an out-of-state state school that\u2019s top 50 Us News and World Report for engineering and graduated with a 3.9. I\u2019m currently work for the federal government. \n\nDo you think I would get accepted for a PhD program?",

            "comment": "Major factors:\n* What discipline? Caltech is more selective in some PhD programs than others.\n* Do you have research experience? Did you do any research in undergrad, or does your current job involve something you could reasonably call \"research\"? Ideally you'd have a paper you could point to, but that's by no means necessary! But you do need some way to show that you have done research, are familiar with the process, and get a letter of recommendation from someone who is a published researcher in your field.\n* Do you have a specific thing you want to do? I'm assuming you have a particular discipline in mind (e.g. \"Chemistry\") but if the more specific your interests (\"Synthesis of organometallic drugs\") the better. You can try reaching out to a professor who does this at Caltech, if you have a common narrow interest. If you just say \"I'm interested in all kinds of X, I see you do Y which sounds pretty cool and I'd love to learn more about it\", you're probably less likely to get them interested in working with you (but they might happily send you stuff to learn more about their work).",

If you don't have someone like this to write you a recommendation it's probably not happening at all.   If you do, that person probably has a *very* good idea of the caliber of program you can get into and could probably just tell you if you ask.  Everything else is speculative.\n\nPerfect scores on tests and perfect GPAs do absolutely nothing to help you get in (though very bad scores and/or GPAs could hurt some, I guess.)",

                    "comment": "You do realize that caltech takes like 250 undergrads each year and about as many grad students right? There\u2019s on the order of 3-5 million undergrads each year, and Caltech accepts about 500 and enrolls 250. That puts this school at the .01% threshold, or the 1% of the 1%. Another metric, about 1.7 million people take the SAT each year. That\u2019s 17,000 people for the top 1%. Caltech has 900 undergrads and 1100 grad students total across 4-6 years worth of classes \n\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s impossible to do with these stats, but they\u2019re certainly below average here. That said, grad admissions is a pretty different process than undergrad, and it\u2019s much more dependent on research work and the field you\u2019re studying (like the other comment says. \n\nAlso, your general advice, while not incorrect, isn\u2019t terribly useful for these situations. If you don\u2019t have relevant commentary, it\u2019s better not to post.",

                                    "comment": "My guy, the OP was asking presumably for Caltech specific advice. You gave a generic motivational speech about overcoming adversity and quoted unhelpful statistics. I provided some context to your points. I also specifically called out that I didn\u2019t want to dissuade them from trying, but that being realistic and getting a more complete understanding of the admissions process and qualifications is important. \n\nOne note also, you\u2019re offering a lot of praise for the test scores and GPA, which I cannot deny are high quality generally, but I\u2019m mostly trying to note that the caliber of academics at caltech is kind of insane. Test scores have become significantly less important to caltech recently, but back when I was applying, the quoted scores and grades would have been on the low end by a good bit, and I was hoping to clarify that for you. The motivation and drive shown by the OP is certainly admirable, but that alone won\u2019t get you through possibly one of the hardest PhD programs in the world. There\u2019s a lot of other factors involved that you\u2019ve frankly ignored. \n\nAlso, as someone wrapping up my four (or five) years at Caltech, I\u2019m decently qualified to comment on the experience here. I\u2019m not trying to represent myself as the most knowledgeable about graduate admissions, but again, the other comment did a pretty great job addressing that.",

Phd programs are generally easier to get into than under grad btw because applicant pool is smaller. Hope this helps!\n*point proven that caltech folks are snarky everyone in my inbox assumes I don't go there cuz im poor. Mfw I'm a 5th year in CCE lmao this is my experience as someone from a poor family going to school with rich kids you can take the advice or leave it. Anyone reading this thread please note that every rich phd reading this took offense enough to harass me and assumes I don't go there. That should be pretty good data for you to work with when considering caltech. It's a pretty good summary of the environment as I have experienced it",

                    "comment": "Statistically speaking, top institutions tend to have more privileged people, not to mention the inherent privilege of getting the Caltech brand name, and a good bit of us tend to be irked by randos appearing in our subreddit with less relevant or unhelpful content, leading to snarky responses, so yeah, your point checks out. \n\nYour observation that PhD admissions rates might be higher than undergrad from a pure statistics standpoint makes sense, but there\u2019s a lot of self-screening done by applicants ahead of time since you\u2019re applying to a specific department and usually have an idea of who you want to work with already. This is compounded by the reputation Caltech has, and due to our tiny size, a lot of the accepted PhD applicants may have already been in touch with departments here. The grad app process is significantly different from undergraduate admissions, so you end up with an apples and oranges comparison of success rates. \n\nI\u2019m also still kind of peeved at the guy who deleted their account after my responses, sorry if any of that carries over here, but I do want to make sure that the OP is getting accurate and (if possible) Caltech-relevant information.",

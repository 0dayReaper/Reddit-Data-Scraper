First-time researchers are usually mentored by a grad student or postdoc for the day-to-day help, like learning how to work the machines. Many PIs have more than one student in the summer, but often those students are not working closely together. While you could pitch your own multi-person project idea to a PI, it might be simpler to ask a few of them what they think would be a promising project to do in their group, then pick the project you\u2019d like best.",

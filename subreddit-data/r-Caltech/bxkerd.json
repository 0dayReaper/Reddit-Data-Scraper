    "postText": "I have an available bedroom/bath in a 2 bed 2 bath condo at the corner of Catalina and California. Utilities is included, just have to pay for your half of internet. The smaller bedroom is going for 1150. The large master with ensuite bath is going for 1400. You will be sharing the apartment with an alum working in Pasadena.\n\nFor those who aren't looking for an apartment, are there Caltech Facebook groups I could post this?",

It\u2019s just that professors sometimes assign a grad student to be the primary supervisor or mentor of said undergrad.\n\nLOL I think I misinterpreted your question. \n\nCaltech grad students got their undergraduate degrees from all over the place (literally every country you can think of with a prominent research institution). In fact it is very rare for a Caltech undergrad to continue at Caltech for grad school. \n\n",

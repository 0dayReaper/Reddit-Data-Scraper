I learned more in math 1b analytical than my peers did in practical. Your grade will almost certainly be worse in both cases too, but it\u2019s pass-fail. \n\nI never had to take ma 1c, but I think that the consensus is to take the practical version of that class.",

In hindsight, though, I wish I hadn\u2019t done prac math. I just personally found 1b and 1c boring/uninteresting since they were so computation-focused. But then again, that is just me, and YMMV tremendously.",

Are you doing something you enjoy or that requires you to use anything you learned in college or are you doing something easy and unrewarding? What kind of people do you work with?\n\nThis is aimed mostly at physics majors.\n\nEveryone always says that caltech opens many doors blah blah blah but I'm starting to think that it opens no more doors than any other place. Considering the rigor it seems to do the opposite. ",

What I care about is what I do on a daily basis, that I actually get to solve physics problems, that I actually see QM ever again, that I actually get to write code, that I'm challenged, etc. So basically, what do you actually do on a day to day basis?

I think my overall GPA ended up around a 3.2, little higher in my major (bio, not physics, but I think the general trend stands), but my SURF led to a publication that led to a PhD from a top graduate program and landing  a competitive postdoc position (ongoing). Having Caltech on my resume was also helpful for finding an industry job before grad school, because the CEO liked to walk potential investors through the lab and tell them their employees had degrees from Caltech and MIT and Harvard, etc. A 3.0 GPA with no research is going to be harder to market, though, so if you aren't already working in a lab start knocking on doors.

The rest of us are just doing what we have to do to get by and find a mate. Welcome to reality.\n\nNot like stem allows anyone to actually do anything to directly affect the human condition anyway so if you are passionate about it you're just buying into the hype.

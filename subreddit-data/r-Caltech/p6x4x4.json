    "postText": "Hi guys, I am currently studying a bachelors' in Biology. Is it possible to find jobs such as lab technician, lab manager, research assistant, etc in labs in Caltech? I plan to work such a job for 1-2 years. Hopefully it can elevate my chances of getting into a good school for masters' (my GPA is quite average).",

            "comment": "You can definitely fin a job at caltech with a bachelor. I'm research scientist and one of my colleague is research associate I believe, we both have a bachelor. Look for position opening, but also, don't be afraid to send your CV to a specific lab that interests you even if you don't see any available position. Good luck!!",

I'm thinking that if I walk into a lab/lab manager's office there is a higher chance for a quick response and a warmer welcome, but I'm not sure if this is considered rude in the US.",

If it was me for example I wouldn't be able to talk to you right away. I would send an email and say that you are available for a meeting asap.",

A quick skim suggests that biology bachelor's degree and some relevant work/research experience may suit the bill for some openings.\n\nAround the turn of the century, I did know a couple of Techer classmates that did a gap year (or more) between graduation and grad school as biology/chemistry research assistants on campus, but I've no idea how things are now with respect to hiring and grad school admissions as I've long since transitioned to working in industry.",

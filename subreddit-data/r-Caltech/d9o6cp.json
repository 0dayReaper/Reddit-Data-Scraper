    "postText": "Hey I'm a master's student in aerospace engineering, at Virginia tech. I was planning to do my PhD at Caltech. But looking up online, I didn't find many people who had gone there solely for a PhD. It's mostly a grad program which consists on a year of master's followed by a PhD. My question is, is there no standalone PhD program at GALCIT specifically, for someone to do after masters from someplace else?",

Your MS from another place doesn't get you anything, except possibly an easier time in the classes since you have seen some of the material before.",

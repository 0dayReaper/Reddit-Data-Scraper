            "comment": "TLDR: you'll be fine. Make friends early and don't burn out!\n\nWhen I was there there was a broad range of personality types, from super awkward to refreshingly ordinary. Most people are able to find friends no matter where they are on this spectrum.\n\n*The first few days are crucial!* Frosh camp (do they still do this?) and Rotation are the best times to meet new people and find new friends. It's much easier than it will be later to drop in on random conversations / activities or simply walk up to people and introduce yourself, since everyone else is also new and trying to figure things out at the same time.\n\nBy and large people aren't competing with *each other*. Most courses have fairly generous collaboration policies, and study / pset groups are a major fixture. How much people care about grades depends a lot on their upbringing, whether grades will matter later (think premed), and whether or not they've realized that it's all just numbers and letters -- by-and-large, what matters more later is how quickly you can learn a new thing and how well you can apply what you've learned for what you need.\n\nHomework load depends on how many units you inflicted on yourself, whether or not you go to office hours and ask good questions, whether or not you take good notes in lecture, whether or not the lectures are aligned with the homework, whether or not you have \"affinity\" to the subject, and whether or not the homework authors were feeling particularly vindictive at the time. (This is independent of institution, though the average Caltech student is juggling more material and the classes themselves tend to move more quickly than in some other places.)\n\nIt's absolutely possible to find a good balance! Most people, though, seem to discover how later than sooner. Also observe that the \"weight\" of a unit varies widely based on how well the underlying course is run, how much affinity you have for it (is it a holy mission? a dreaded burden? just another day's work?), and how up-to-date you are on your sleep budget (**do not neglect this**).\n\nIf you're looking to take more than like 48 units, ask yourself why, and ask yourself if it's really worth it. *It's OK to drop classes if you find you need to!*, but the sooner in the semester you discover you need to do this, the sooner you can reallocate resources to everything else, and the better off you'll be.",

A class I took with only 2 others in it, we just work on the entire set together, because that was the only realistic way of learning / getting work done.",

As stated on the website, \"We would like your\u00a0humanities or social science teacher to comment on your writing skills, so be sure to ask a teacher from a class with a significant writing component.\" (https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/first-year-applicants/teacher-evaluations)\n\nIt seems that a foreign language teacher is a grey area. Please contact the admissions office.",

It would be akin to me introducing myself to you and asking you why my aunt, who also lives in South Africa, is constantly getting robbed. Making a good first impression goes a long way. \n\nTo answer your questions, the US and Europe have different styles of higher education. The US model focusing on a more well-rounded undergraduate education with distribution requirements, with specialization occurring more at the graduate level. In Europe, your undergraduate coursework is entirely focused on your area of study.\n\nIf you look down upon the US model for higher education, then by all means, don't come to school here. ",

(Often you are given a master's as part of your Ph.D. program when you complete 75% of the requirements.)  The main reasons to do a master's would be if you're trying to change fields or if you did a really poor job in undergrad and want to show that you're capable of surviving a Ph.D. program.",

            "comment": "&gt; why do I have to do these subjects when I would be there to study physics?\n\nPart of Caltech's mission is to make well rounded scientists. Even if you are studying physics, a knowledge of chemistry and biology will make you a better thinker, a better scientist, and ultimately make you more competent in thinking logically about the world. This is in addition to the fact that science on a professional level is increasingly 'multidisciplinary'; about half the physicists I know are doing research on biological questions anyway. It's where the funding (and a lot of interesting open questions) are.\n\nThe PE requirement is typically seen as quite an albatross, but honestly, you should be doing about 3-6 units of exercise (in or out of class) while you're at Caltech anyway, just for the consideration of your physical health.\n\n&gt; My second question is what is it like being a physics pupil studying Biology and those other (to me) useless subjects?\n\nAssuming you're interested in Caltech for undergrad, here's how Core works: Everyone takes all the classes, physics, math, chemistry, biology. Passing out of any of Core is atypical, and required demonstrating competency on everything in the class via a series of exams. It doesn't matter what your major is (much) you do the work.\n\n&gt; My third, and final question is why does it take so long for me to obtain my Masters degree in America as opposed to the UK?\n\nBecause they're different degrees. [Educate yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education#United_States).\n\n&gt; he dismay in the title of my post comes from the fact that I am not physically oriented towards endurance sports/running, I am built for weight lifting.\n\nWell, there is a weight training class, but you seem pretty dead set against PE in general.\n\n&gt; Oh and did you know that this !? is called an interrobang?\n\nYes, and so does everyone else. It's not that impressive.",

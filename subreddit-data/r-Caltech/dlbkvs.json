My experience has been that the only way to get a masters in a hard science at an R1 university is to either get one in the process of your PhD if that\u2019s the way your program rolls (like at Caltech I think aero awards a masters?) or to be awarded one if you pass candidacy but fail out (or just decide to leave) before finishing with your doctorate. In some fields having a master\u2019s is almost more of a scarlet letter of sorts because it\u2019s code for \u201cI intended to get a PhD but didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t generally apply to schools like Caltech and MIT with the stated intention of pursuing a masters in math/phys/chem/bio. I don\u2019t know about engineering though - YMMV. \n\nSource: I have a PhD in chemistry from Caltech.",

Aero at Caltech kind of has terminal master's but mostly Caltech fits your description - people are there for the PhD and get a master's along the way. If they leave with a master's it's usually because they chose not to finish the PhD or were asked to leave.",

The grad office has a self-guided walking tour, which is probably the best thing to start with.  [http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/245-self-guided\\_tour\\_letter-sized\\_booklet2\\_march2016.pdf](http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/245-self-guided_tour_letter-sized_booklet2_march2016.pdf)  \n\nIf you know the program you intend to apply to, you also might want to try reaching out to a professor you're interested in or reaching out to one of the administrators (like a Department Administrator or another staff member). I toured Caltech after applying but before getting accepted and they scheduled meetings with various faculty while I was there, so it functioned as a sort of interview.",

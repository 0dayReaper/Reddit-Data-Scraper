    "postText": "Hey, any Neurobiology PhD Student here? I am a newly admitted student in the program, and I would like to ask some questions regarding the coursework.\n\nLet me briefly explain my situation. I have a CS undergrad (lots of math) and a Biotechnology master's. In the past years I had the opportunity to perform lots of research in very good labs around the US, so I feel pretty confident in research. What I don't feel comfortable about at the moment is math and physics (it's been 4 years now since I solved my last integral probably).\n\nSo my question is... Are classes in the Neuro program highly focused on math/physics? And if yes -actually, regardless I want to go back to being comfortable with those skills- what would you suggest doing to re-gain confidence with math while having an overview of physics?\n\nSilly question for a Caltech PhD student, but I really don't want to end up failing my PhD because of classes. Thanks ppl of Reddit!",

            "comment": "Looks like the neurobiology grad program has these requirements:\n\nOne course in molecular, cellular, developmental neurobiology;\nOne course in circuits, systems, behavioral biology;\nOne course in mathematical methods (depending on student background);\nBE/CNS/NB 164, Tools of Neurobiology;\nTwo electives.\n\nIt sounds to me like you can choose those courses to lean towards math and physics, or instead to lean towards biology if you prefer. I would expect that you have enough freedom so that you won\u2019t be forced to take classes you aren\u2019t prepared for, especially with a CS undergrad.\n\nSpeaking from experience, courses from biology and bioengineering are relatively gentle with physics and math with respect to upper division courses from physics/other engineering departments. Beyond calculus and maybe basic ODEs, they will teach you what you need to know.",

    "postText": "I am not a Caltech student, but I was browsing The Grad Cafe and saw this incredibly disturbing post today from someone rejected from the Aero PhD program threatening to shoot people at Caltech and commit suicide. Is there some sort of protocol for this? Considering recent shootings around the US, I am legitimately concerned. Was hoping to get this out to Caltech students just to increase visibility and vigilance.\n\nThe text of the post is as follows:\n&gt; Not even my name on the fu\\*\\*ing letter? Well, thank you! Gonna make them pay and then commit suicide. The indifference of the whole process with meaningless rejections is too much to take now. I just can\\`t... fu\\*\\*ing idiots who can barely comprehend stuff got into some program, and here all rejections! 10! I can\\`t, I just can\\`t. The business side of it all is too brutal to take. I can\\`t cope. How do you people even cope with this sh\\*\\*? Gonna go there and shoot people up and then will off myself. They need to pay. On their high horses, too smart to mention my name in my letter. They are not entitled to live. It\\`s a game, so I\\`ll show them the real game. The indifference is what hurts; couldn\\`t care less about a rejection, but the lies. The lies! They mocked and insulted my intelligence by the last line. They could\\`ve lived had they really told me in clear sense what was the issue: funding, faculty didn\\`t take me, didn\\`t think I was prepared enough, just anything. BUT WHAT THE fu\\*\\* IS THAT CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE? Why do they treat others people like this? Not a modicu\\* of respect. The indifferent attitude was very uncalled for. If I\\`m not entitled to a reason and they are a business and can do whatever the fu\\*\\* they want, then I can also do whatever the fu\\*\\* I want. Now the tower will fall people, the tower will fall. Mark my words!\n\nEDIT:\n\n1) TheGradCafe moderator Warelin was also contacted last night, and the original posting has since been removed. Thanks to anon below who also provided a cached link [here](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fx-Jwc9O_6gJ:https://www.thegradcafe.com/survey/index.php). The screenshot I uploaded to imgur has been removed (not sure the reason). If anybody requires the image in any official capacity, please contact this throwaway account. I will be monitoring it over this next week.\n\n2) If authorities are using this post for information, it is worth noting that the apostrophes in the post are actually backticks, which is fairly distinctive. The quote block above has been edited to reflect that.\n\n3) I saw the post around 11PM Pacific Time Mar. 26, but the website said the post was made on Mar. 27. I'm not sure whether this reflects the website's server time or the local time of the poster.\n\nStay safe, everybody.",

Post-docs are disheartening, even industry interviews are stressful.  The best thing he could have done is take a week off, reassess his performance, and approach it differently next time.

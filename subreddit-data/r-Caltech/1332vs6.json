    "postText": "Hi all! I am a prospective PhD applicant in computer science / applied mathematics preferably in fields like natural language processing or AI in a couple of years from now. My research and publications experience is lacking, so I wanted to get research experience for the next couple of years before applying for a PhD.\n\nIs it possible to get research / publications experience at Cal Tech after graduating from undergrad from another university, preferably in a part-time role? I looked at the opportunities available online at Cal Tech, and it seems like all of them are for current undergraduate students, i.e. SURF etc. If anyone can provide any tips about how I can go about doing this, or have personal experience in doing this, I would greatly appreciate it. If there are any remote opportunities too, that would be even better.\n\nSome background on me. I am an applied math graduate from UCLA, and I currently work as a software engineer for one of the big U.S. defense contractors. I am considering on applying for research scientist positions at my company in the next couple of months to help me get research experience, and I wanted to get even more research experience at Cal Tech. For my situation, Cal Tech is the closest university to me that I could realistically commute to while having a full-time job, so that is why I was specifically looking at Cal Tech.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Though unlikely any of those roles would allow you to have another full time job (assuming that it\u2019s not a night shift type of job).",

Could you also let me know how your schedule worked out in terms of time commitments?\n\nLearning about your experience would be great to know before I reach out to professors. You can DM me if you like to share through that method too. Thanks for the informative advice",

There IS definitely a chance you won't get co-authorship even if you work as a research tech.\n\nWith that said, many of Caltech's research techs end up going for their PhDs and having a letter of recommendation from a Caltech PI definitely is a plus.",

On the wet lab side (bio), I have seen part-time lab tech positions.  With that said, you generally don't get to make your own hours and have to be available during your scheduled hours.  There may be more flexibility in a computational group, but as a new hire, I doubt you will have enough freedom to OE.",

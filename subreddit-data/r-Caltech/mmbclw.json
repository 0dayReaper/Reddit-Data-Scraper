I'm not sure what to expect with everything going on with COVID and all but was hoping that someone here could shed some light on the waitlist process. If you have any suggestions on what I can/should do, I'd really appreciate it (I'm already submitting the additional updates).",

(Now I am back in the subreddit as an incoming grad student) I think different schools handle waitlists differently and your chances of getting in can be anywhere from a few percent to ~50%.",

    "postText": "I'm a Saudi Arabian student in my junior year hoping to study physics in Caltech. As a part of my school's American High School Diploma program, I take most of my classes in English according to California's standard curriculum, How convenient =). I'm ranked first in my class and fourth in the grade, with a GPA of 4.85 (For some reason, our GPAs are out of five). I am the president of our school's science club. I'm participating in a national science innovation fair, the winners of which will represent Saudi Arabia in ISEF. Also, I plan on joining Google's 2013 science fair. I was accepted into a summer program in Saudi, and I recently applied for another summer program in California (Which happens to be able to send some information on me to Caltech). I intend to participate in and organize as much community service opportunities as possible.\n\nWhat are my chances of being accepted according to the description?\nWhat more can I do to improve my history?",

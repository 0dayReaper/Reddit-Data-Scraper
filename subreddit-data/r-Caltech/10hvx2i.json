    "postText": "Hello, I am an International (non Caltech) undergraduate student (India) in my junior year. I came across this program and found out that we need to get in touch with Mentors with similar research interests but Intl. students are not allowed in JPL, am I right ?  \n\n\nAlso does this [link](http://announcements.surf.caltech.edu/index.cfm?event=ShowAOPublicList&amp;inFrame=&amp;type=SURF&amp;formType=AO_CIT) only show SURF JPL Projects listed by Caltech Faculty ? \n\nI am very interested in this program but the eligibility criteria and process is still a little unclear to me, hoping someone could help me out since the deadline is not too far away. Thanks in advance !",

That link you posted also shows Caltech faculty offerings\n3. They suggest you sign on to the [virtual sessions](https://sfp.caltech.edu/sfp-calendar) that have been happening twice a week since the fall. But, applications are due Feb. 22nd so there isn\u2019t much time left. \n4. They also recommend considering the [VURP/Flex VURP programs](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/vurp/flex-vurp) if your university or potential mentor can support your stay.  \n\n\nAs for emailing faculty, it's very possible they are inundated with lots of interest and email. Some faculty do proactively post about seeking students, you may check if any of your desired mentors are using Twitter as a number of Caltech faculty share information via their personal Twitter feeds.",

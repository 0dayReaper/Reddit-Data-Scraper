    "postText": "I find the concept of take home exams very interesting. I think it's interesting that cheating is said to be rare due to the fact that the questions are apparently created in such a way that cheating is not really possible. I'm curious how exactly these questions (that hinder attempts at cheating) look like. \n\nCan anyone give me a couple of exmaples of such questions, or point me to a repository of take home exam questions? I can't seem to find any examples online. Ideally engineering or physics questions, as those are the fields with which I'm familiar, but any questions will do.",

            "comment": "First off, most of our finals won\u2019t be posted online, since the tests often are similar year to year. However, the tests tend to be about as difficult as the harder questions on problem sets, which you can find a bit more easily if you want. \n\nBefore we even get into potential cheating though, we should address the Honor Code, which effectively prohibits cheating. Cheating is rare because Caltech students believe in the honor code and abide by it, not just due to how the questions are written. \n\nFor the tests, the questions aren\u2019t so much designed to make cheating hard, they\u2019re more designed to test actual knowledge and problem solving abilities. The way we prevent cheating is through a student-run official group called the Board of Control (BoC). Cases of cheating would be reported by the professors, TAs, or other students who witness it or are suspicious that there may be an unfair advantage gained somewhere. Because our questions are so open ended, similarities to the work of another student or to a disallowed resource (like the textbook (if not allowed on that test) or to something like Wikipedia) or other evidence of cheating will stand out a lot more, leading to them being reported to the BoC, which then investigates more thoroughly.",

The exams are designed to ask interesting hard questions which test understanding of the material (rather than rote memorization). The point of Caltech is to follow the spirit of the law rather than the letter of the law. Anyone who tries to \"get around\" the Honor Code should not come here.",

Short of working with a classmate, not sure how I would have cheated even if I wanted to. The exams weren\u2019t regurgitating knowledge from the book, but difficult and open ended and often involved like writing proofs or doing some coding that I feel like would have been super obvious if it was too close to other people\u2019s.\n\nAlso the honor code prevents people from cheating because people believe in it. Probably not 100% of people, but I feel like we had a really high compliance rate because it\u2019s part of the culture.",

You may use a calculator for numerical calculations only (not algebraic manipulations).\"\n\nThis changes some with later classes but might give you an idea.\n\nEdit: I'd add that many of our exams are not designed such that cheating is impossible. For instance, some classes have unlimited time finals where you need to prove a set of statements. It would of course be very easy to cheat by googling the answers--these aren't novel proofs, after all. It's just that you don't, because we believe in the honor code and put that above getting a higher score on the exam.",

    "postText": "Hi I am a prefrosh math-major-wannabe, I'd like to do some cool useful math surfs at Caltech, but I've been hearing from different people either 1) they did math surf since frosh summer or 2) math research is so hard it requires so much knowledge you can't do during frosh or smore. I am thus kinda confused so here are some questions:\n\n1. What are the qualifications that allow one to be more likely to get a math surf? /Are there certain courses that you have to take before being able to do a math surf?\n2. On the scale of \\[just to learn how to format LaTex\\] to \\[usefully proving specific easy cases\\] to \\[actual :0 cutting edge research\\], how real is the surf math research on average? What's the most not real/real it can get?\n3. What's it like during a math surf? Does one learn and read some stuffs on the topic first before diving into writing? Or does writing come immediately?",

            "comment": "Hi prefrosh! I'm a math major who has done math research all 3 summers. \n\n1. Coursework...doesn't really matter for frosh SURF since almost always it won't be enough. The best class to take to try on a math hat is Ma 5abc (abstract algebra) -- in addition to being a great way to develop mathematical maturity, Ma 5 is the only class I've ever heard a prof ask that a frosh have taken in order to do a math SURF. \n\nQualifications...in my experience it helps to get your foot in the door if you have previous \"research\" experience. I know it's crazy. Any big project in math you worked on that wasn't \"scripted\" is good, it doesn't have to have resulted in a published paper. This isn't a requirement but it sends a signal to the prof that you won't be totally lost when given an open question. \n\n2. Some frosh math SURFs end up \"I learned this stuff and couldn't do anything with it\" or \"I wrote code to construct an object but it wasn't fast enough so we didn't construct anything\". Other frosh math SURFs end up with published papers. How your SURF turns out depends more on how supportive your mentor was than how good you are so I wouldn't worry about this too much. The purpose of a frosh math SURF is to get your foot in the door for a more legit smore SURF, and so on until grad school (if you're committed to the academia path, which you don't have to be yet).\n\n3. Depends on the mentor. I've had daily meetings some years and weekly meetings other years. Sometimes I spent a lot of time reading papers trying to come up with things to try. Other times my mentor would tell me \"I think X is promising, go do it\" and I'd just do that and report back. Definitely you read / learn before you write...otherwise what on earth would you write about? The final \"SURF paper\" is not a big deal, word of mouth says nobody actually reads it. If you get a result potentially publishable in a real journal then you'll have to spend significant time writing at the end of your project, possibly assisted by your mentor. \n\n\nOverall, getting a frosh SURF is really luck based. Even if you are super qualified sometimes a prof will just decide to take on the junior who seems easier to manage over an unpredictable frosh. If you want to do math research and SURFs aren't available, you may also want to check out REUs. They are math research experiences at other schools, funded by the NSF (and since only profs who care bother to get REU funding often they are more dedicated and experienced mentors for inexperienced researchers). If you want to go in that direction, note that you can apply for an \"off campus SURF\" with the REU prof (if they are willing to take you on). REU funding can be insanely competitive (&lt;1% acceptance rate sometimes) but basically any Caltech student with a pulse can get a SURF. \n\nFor now, since you're a prefrosh, I'd just say don't stress out, do cool math things if they excite you, and once it's late fall term start more concretely looking at summer options.",

            "comment": "I did two math SURFs (frosh and junior summers) and one math REU (soph summer) at another school. It was a little too easy to get my first SURF - I had no research experience, had only taken Ma5, and had absolutely zero ideas for research projects - I simply stumbled (in my pajamas) into the office of the prof who had taught Ma5ab and asked for a SURF. He didn\u2019t recognize my face but checked my grades in the course (pass pass, baby) and decided they were good enough for a SURF. The project involved working on a special case of a pretty big conjecture in group theory which I believe is still open and for which I was definitely under-qualified. My advisor was fairly hands-off and basically gave me a giant stack of old papers to read on my own. I got through maybe one of those and mostly learned background material by reading old textbooks in SFL. In the end, I made some partial progress but definitely did not solve the problem.\n\nMy junior year SURF was a totally different experience: it was with a post doc in an analysis-related field, who was much more involved, and the problem was both more niche and more accessible to me (by this point I had taken 108 and 110, which helped). That summer was overall more enjoyable and more successful than the first, and led to a publication.\n\nMy advice: don\u2019t do a pure math SURF in your freshman year. I\u2019d recommend either an applied/programming-heavy SURF, or better yet an actual internship in software or fintech. Then after you\u2019ve had some real world experience and a few graduate courses under your belt, you can take a crack at math research. (I *really* wish I had done an internship.) Also, if you\u2019re intent on doing math research every summer, try to do at least one external REU (like Duluth or SMALL) - it\u2019s a great way to meet and collaborate with other math people, and much more fun/less lonely than a SURF (but possibly more selective). \n\ntldr; I\u2019d shoot for one internship, one REU and one SURF, in that order. Don\u2019t do three math SURFs.",

            "comment": "Not a math major and haven't done a math SURF, but I can address some of the points here. \n\nFrosh SURFs tend to be not terribly \"real\" as you say, mostly because you aren't particularly qualified at the time. Math, more than some other fields, doesn't have as much lower level work you can start with (for example, Mechanical Engineering SURFs could have you prototype something small for a lab, or Astro SURFs could have you doing some data analysis). You'd probably have to have a good bit of background in the field before starting in on a project, so you'd definitely have a lot of reading to do. \n\nI'm really not sure what kind of pure math SURF you could do after freshman year. I could see some computer simulations for the computational sides of math (random walks, etc), but I think most of the theoretical math work would be pretty far beyond what you'd learn in your first year. However, once you start taking the math major specific courses (ma5, 108, etc), you might have enough background to start working on something niche. You would probably have to talk to a professor who you want to work with to see if they have specific classes in mind that would be useful. By later years (ie junior year summer), you'd probably be able to get to some quite interesting stuff, although I don't know about true cutting edge. If anything, it would be something specific or novel that hasn't been studied as well thus far.",

            "comment": "1. Ma5 (algebra) and 108 (analysis) is a good foundation but it's possible to do a frosh math surf with just Ma5. Add Ma109 if the surf has anything to do with topology/geometry.\n\n2. A frosh math surf is probably going to be either mostly reading/learning or computational. But you will learn a lot even if you don't end up proving anything new, and depending on the field you might be able to work on a specific easy case. If you can't get a math surf as a frosh, you can try to get a surf in a different field, since it will still give you research experience. Sophomore or junior surfs can get more \"real\", like co-authoring a paper, though this is a lot of luck with finding an advisor with a project that can be done by an undergrad in a summer, and writing a paper isn't necessary for a successful surf. Most real research takes longer than 10 weeks anyway so maybe it's actually more real if you don't have results to publish a paper.\n\n3. You usually start reading and learning some stuff on the topic in the winter or spring quarters (especially if you need to take a class in the topic) and early summer. You don't start writing immediately since you first have to prove something to write up.",

    "postText": "About 2 years ago, Caltech received a massive donation to work on carbon studies. Then Covid hit like a mass health crisis tsunami. I wonder what has been happening and if there's been off-campus work with carbon studies since Covid got real..? Just a passing inquiry. I came onto campus to focus on biology lectures and room seminars but I found ecology and global warming \"studies\" more compelling. Caltech is leading a lot of anti-carbon research, yes? I'd like to know a little more..",

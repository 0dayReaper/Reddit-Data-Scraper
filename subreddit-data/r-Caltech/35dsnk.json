    "postText": "Does anybody have any experience with studying abroad at Caltech (not from Caltech)? \n\nIt's an option for me to (apply) to go there in my 3rd year, but I'm not sure what the experience will be like. I've read quite a bit about Caltech, and it does seem the sort of place that I'd enjoy, however all of what I've read is from people who've spent their whole time there.\n\nDo internationals have a hard time fitting in? Do they tend to crash and burn with the workload? Is there even any time to go and explore the US whilst you're there? \n\nThanks and all the best",

            "comment": "While I did not study abroad (to Caltech, anyhow), I had some friends who did and I believe they all enjoyed it. I don't think they had trouble fitting in, and you wouldn't have known that they were international if you didn't ask (other than a few cultural misunderstandings, e.g. \"pants\" != \"underwear\" in the US). I know one group of Danes that found time to visit San Francisco and Las Vegas while here, so it is doable, but don't plan on a grand US tour. (They mostly hung out with each other, so they didn't integrate as well as other international students did.)\n\nI expect that Caltech would be substantially harder than the other schools you indicated you were interested in (and while I have no personal experience with UCL, I imagine Caltech is a step up in difficulty from there as well). A lot of non-international Caltech students do crash and burn, so there is some concern, but generally it takes longer than a year to burn out so international may fare better on account of that.\n\nAside from the level of difficulty, Caltech is also very academically-focused compared to other schools. Many of the students are very passionate about the sciences and are excited to be learning new things and share what they learn with others. Social life tends to revolve around academics, e.g. working together with other students on sets being the most obvious example. While you can find groups of students interested in things like rock climbing or theater or whatever, for most people these interests take a back seat to academics.",

This answer was incredibly informative and really helpful. \n\nTravelling a little in term time would be very nice, and if the danes found time I'd imagine I could as well (I can always work on the plane/train/bus, right? ;) ). \n\nI assumed caltech was a step up in difficulty from just about anywhere, to be honest! Could you give me an idea of how much time you'd expect to spend working at Caltech? I'd say on average I do 30 hours a week over the whole year, here (although it's mainly concentrated in 2 months of 15 hour days around exams, which is a bad habit and I know it wouldn't work with the caltech assessment system). \n\nI wouldn't say I'm a particularly passionate person, especially about science, but I love learning, and I'm only really happy when I have to work hard (otherwise I get bored). It's probably not the best mindset to have, but I feel I could really get into the work at caltech (also JPL's pretty cool, I've heard rumours that you get to go to space a couple of times a week ;D).\n\nThanks again, iqtestsmeannothing, you're a damn helpful person!",

                            "comment": "It's not so much that the work is more time consuming, but that the difficulty tends to be quite high, and students are expected to learn and understand new concepts quickly with minimal instruction. The list of required classes is also long (e.g., all students regardless of major must take for the physics requirement classical mechanics, electromagnetism, special relativity, wave mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics), but that won't matter to you. I'd suggest finding a few courses that look interesting to you in the course catalog and seeing if you can find their syllabuses online. Typical workload for undergrads is 45 units (which is nominally 45 hours of work per week, although some classes may need more or less time than they are rated for).",

            "comment": "I agree with crivexp2. To add:\n\n1) Pasadena traffic isn't an issue, so it's pretty avoidable except for the weekend trips to the beach.\n\n2) I didn't do much outdoors stuff, but the San Gabriel mountains are just north. Also, Pasadena has done a good job maintaining natural elements (e.g. trees, grass) within the city, particularly relative to LA.\n\n3) IMO Caltech actually does a really good job fostering interdisciplinary research because of it's small size. The departments are so small it's much more likely for you to interact with other departments, and that's how many interdisciplinary research projects get started.",

            "comment": "1 - traffic is pretty bad, and hard to avoid if you're trying to get somewhere during rush hour.  But if you're living in or around Pasadena things will be generally fine.  If you're thinking about living closer to downtown LA you'll be somewhat against rush hour, but if you're trying to live closer to Santa Monica you're going to have a bad time.  There is a new metro line that opens this month that'll get you from Pasadena to Santa Monica through Union station though.\n\n2 - if you're a hiking type person, there's the San Gabriel mountains 20 mins north of campus, lots of mountain routes.  Pasadena itself is mostly suburb and has a lot of green space between buildings relative to the rest of the LA area.  However, you will be surrounded by urban sprawl and there isn't much you can do to avoid that in LA\n\n3 - it is a small campus and you won't find as many groups as larger ones, but there are still plenty of student groups.  I was an undergrad so I'm not familiar with the grad student programs or lifestyle as much though.",

            "comment": "I was a grad student from 2003-2009.  My take is:\n\n1.  You'll want to live in Pasadena.  Dealing with both a research advisor and LA freeway traffic won't work on a regular basis.    Pasadena's not a bad place to live, either.  There's good food, stuff to do, and reasonable proximity to some of the more interesting things LA has to offer.\n\n2. You're going to be spending a lot of time on campus.  Caltech's campus is ridiculously well-kept, green and lush.  I never got the sense I lived in an urban wasteland while I was in Pasadena.  If you're looking for outdoor activities, I can't point you to specifics but I know my fellow grad students were always hiking around the San Gabriels or going off to camp in Joshua Tree or skiing at Mammoth or going to the beach in Santa Monica.  \n\n3. You're not going to get the same experience at Caltech that you would at Cal or Michigan.  It's a tiny school which happens to be the best in the world at a particular set of research disciplines (gravitational physics, planetary sciences, quantum information, etc.).  If you're planning on working in one of those disciplines, then you'll have amazing resources at your disposal.  If you're not planning on working in one of those disciplines, then it may not be the right choice to go to Caltech.",

Plenty of hiking/open space. Also, the Huntington Gardens and several parks are nearby\n\n3) Check out Caltech's chapter of Engineers for a Sustainable World. They are fairly active",

            "comment": "1. Live in Pasadena. It's nice, and when you do get free time you can go to downtown or santa monica on the train (takes a while, but straightforward. ish.) Besides, you're gonna be spending all your time in the Rathskeller anyway.\n2. There is plenty of awesome nature very near Caltech campus. A short drive/painful bikeride away are the beautiful San Gabriels, with hundreds of hiking trails. And lions and deer. A long walk/lovely bikeride away are several huge gardens (the Huntington Gardens, e.g.). With peafowl.\n3. *shrug*.",

            "comment": "I did my undergrad at Berkeley, and I did an internship in LA a couple summers ago. Traffic in the SF bay area can be just as bad as traffic in LA (the only difference is that relatively few people who live in the SF bay area actually drive to get to work). \n\nThere's pretty fantastic nature within driving distance from Caltech. It's hard to match the Fire Trails at Berkeley (in terms of convenience and grandeur) but a 30 minute drive from Caltech can probably take you to similar spots.\n\nAs I understand it, nearly everything at Caltech is interdisciplinary in some sense (out of necessity, since the institute is so small). Research in Berkeley is much more siloed. (At least, this is the impression I've developed after taking graduate courses in EECS and IEOR, + working with PhD students in Transportation Engineering.)\n \nMy only qualm about leaving Berkeley for Caltech is living at the base of the Berkeley hills (I'm pretty sure the roof of my building has a better view than anything in LA).",

A bit expensive, and not all apartments have actual high-speed internet so make sure you ask about that, but everything is within walking distance pretty much and it's Socal so you don't even have to worry about weather really.",

I recently accepted my Ph.D. offer to Caltech and just wanted to ask fellow students what\u2019s your favourite part about attending Caltech ?: )\n\nFor context, I enjoyed my visit and loved the campus, but what is something special you found about Caltech that would not have been experienced at other schools?\n\nGo Beavers!!",

            "comment": "Post-graduation I\u2019ve enjoyed the slow realization that the major requirements at Caltech are absurdly rigorous compared to basically any other university. I saw a video about a Stanford CS grad complaining for minutes on end that he had to take an AB calc equivalent for his CS degree. It made me think of all of those poor CS majors at Caltech that had to take Lin alg, multivariable, and diff eq.\n\nAlso my math degree required me to take nearly as many HSS classes as my sister\u2019s Hist &amp; Lit degree at Harvard.",

This thread is about our favorite parts about attending Caltech? This has been one of my favorite parts post-graduation. I knew our course load was tough at the time, but I figured compatible schools had similar requirements. You don\u2019t realize until you start talking to people or doing graduate programs at other schools just how many more courses you have to take at Caltech for a lot of the majors.",

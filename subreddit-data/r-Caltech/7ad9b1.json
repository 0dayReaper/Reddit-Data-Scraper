    "postText": "I'm applying for an exchange program at Caltech for the fall term 2018. I have to draft a study plan for the application, but I find the course catalog a little confusing.\n\nSpecifically I'm interested in taking a course that's being held in the \"first, second terms\". Does this mean that the same course is being offered separately in the two terms, or does it mean that it's one long course that you have to take for two consecutive terms to complete?\n\nSince I'll only be there for one term it's a pretty important distinction to make!",

            "comment": "It depends on the course, but generally something with letters after the number is one long course, at least content-wise. For example, Ph 125abc is a year-long course in quantum mechanics. But in some cases each term is independent of the rest, e.g. you could take Ph 135c without  Ph 135a or 135b.\n\nIf there are no letters, e.g. Ph 20, but is held multiple terms, then it's a one-term class that is offered multiple times a year. \n\nEDIT: In terms of registration/grades, each term of a class is independent of the other. So you would e.g. sign up for Ph125a, do its homework/midterm/final and then get a grade for that at the end of fall term. ",

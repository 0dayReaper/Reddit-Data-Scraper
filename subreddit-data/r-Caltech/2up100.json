If anyone could spare a moment and upload those notes and link them I would really appreciate it! \n\nhttp://www.astro.caltech.edu/~golwala/ph106bc/\n\n(2015 version to be available here: pdf)\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

In general, sending things like t hi is to anonymous people on the Internet who aren't affiliated with caltech is a bad idea unless you get the professor's permission to distribute it. If it's IP locked, there's probably a reason. You can always contact the professor yourself and ask.",

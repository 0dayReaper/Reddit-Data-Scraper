    "postText": "Hello! I'm an undergrad and I have a lease expiring at the end of August so I've been looking for roomates to either move in with me or move to a new place. I've found one other person that will be here until December and we also found an apartment at 211 S Wilson that we are interested in moving to where the rent will be $800 per person (with utilities included) and a $666.66 security deposit per person. Alternatively, if we stay at my current dwelling both of the rooms are around $833-$900 per month - not sure exactly as the rent hasn't been split evenly. The current place is at 987 E Del Mar. Both apartments are 2 bedrooms and 2 baths with hardwood floors, AC, a laundry facility or in unit (respectively), 2 parking spots, normal kitchen amenities, etc. The Wilson one might be nicer though as the current place has been lived in by many generations of students. Also, utilities are not included in the rent at the Del Mar apt. We also have the living room fashioned into my bedroom and both bathrooms are in the actual bedrooms which has not been a large issue over the years but is part of the reason we are looking to move (so I don't wake anyone at night). The apartment on Wilson is described as \"mostly furnished\" which translates into having a bed ready for you and a small looking desk+chair in the living room that id be happy to give up. Both are essentially a 3ish minute walk to campus if not for the pesky traffic light! The Del Mar apartment is also furnished for obvious reasons - but you may have to pay my current roomates for the furniture. \n\nAll manner of people are welcome, including grad students and visiting researchers, etc. We're looking for one person for a year long lease starting in September and another person to switch out after/around new years (so January-end of August 2021). The Wilson apartment is listed as a 6 month lease but we can always renew or just ask for a longer one from the start.\n\nAnyone interested please feel free to DM me!\n-Monika (mgetsova@caltech.edu but I've not been checking it so dm is easier... Or find me on messenger as \"Monika Getsova\" or text 7573557637)\n\nOr contact Jade at jliving@alumni.caltech.edu.",

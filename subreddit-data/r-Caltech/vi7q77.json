    "postText": "(undergrad) hello!! i\u2019m a rising high school senior planning to apply to caltech. i would love to major in materials science and minor in aerospace engineering. \n\ni just have a couple questions!\n\n1. how many people typically major in materials science?\n\n2. if i research aerospace applications of materials science, which research area would best fit that?\n\n3. could i have some insight on the materials science professors?",

            "comment": "1. Literally none. The class of '24 has 3 (soon to be 4) materials science majors, and as far as I'm aware the class of '25 has none. \n2. I am definitely not the best person to ask but our aero program is really well ranked! I think you should have no problem finding a lab or professor in aero. \n3. I just switched into the major so I don't have much insight on professors, but you can visit the [Caltech Matierials Science website](https://ms.caltech.edu/) to see which professors teach what classes and what their research interests are. \n\nJust a heads up: there are a few majors at Caltech (which aren't materials science) which offer materials tracks. I know for certain the Mechanical Engineering does (since that's what I switched out of), as well as ChemE (I think??). Since it's such a small major and a pretty niche subject in general it might be a good idea to shop around and see if there are other programs which encompass your interests better. Hope this helps!",

I think of it as a digital camera for film user. I started out years ago with Nikon F2AS with 50 mm f 1.2 (an overkill, I know, for a high school kid). Fastest film was 3M T640 (used for high school theater productions and the prints were done on a color Xerox machine. Then moved onto Canon Digital Rebel, then 5D and Mark II later. Now I switched to Sigma after have read so much about what it could, and could not do. Am not a \"spray and pray\" kind of photographers so I do take the time as if I were using film. Hence I don't know how to do sport photography or anything with fast action.  SD Quattro as you know is it made for that and for anyone else who may think about getting one for that purpose would be sorely disappointed. For the first time yesterday I took it to a public event and shot a few photos of a friend of mine and her boyfriend selling knickknacks at their stand. The results were very acceptable to me. I used 18 to 200 mm Sigma and saved in DNG format (edited in Lightroom). I just did some minor exposure (backlight) correction and it came out very satisfactory. I think the camera is really good for perhaps portrait, landscape, and still life.\n\nThe camera gets warm after a while. It may warn you so (this is not in the main part of the manual - it's in the warning section). Just turn it off for a few minutes and it will cool down.\n\nI was able to get the third-party batteries which worked perfectly fine from Amazon/eBay. These batteries are actually made for Panasonic cameras and they are identical.\n\nI should try to do identical shots with 5D Mark II with this Sigma. (But Mark II is so heavy with the handgrip and 24-70 mm-I don't think I can carry both around.) One thing I have noticed is that the outputs from Sigma a very \"clean.\" I may be a little bias but to me, it felt like a scan from an Ektachrome or even a Kodachrome.  Like this one [https://www.flickr.com/photos/little\\_pooky/51303600828/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pooky/51303600828/)   To me, it's saturated like film, without being artificially so (by software).\n\nHere are more shots. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/little\\_pooky](https://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pooky)  If you look far enough, you'll see scans of film (Kodacolor 400) taken at Eton College (Berkshire, UK), too.\n\nCaltech was lovely, but it gets too hot after 10 a.m. There were no students at all - they were all sleeping in!\n\nI use Dragon to write this, and unfortunately occasional typographical errors.",

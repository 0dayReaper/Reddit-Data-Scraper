Ask for a meeting to discuss further opportunities \n\nProfessors in my experience wont be annoyed by a student who wants to learn and shows genuine interest. They are busy though, and may he slow to respond.  Often professors, especially the bigger ones, have assistants. If you can find the assistants email, cc'ing them on the email can help get you a response. You also shouldnt be afraid to politely bump the thread if you dont get a response in a week.\n\nAlso, i know its scary, but sometimes talking to people is much faster than email. Picking up the phone or going to the professors office hours can show your eagerness and interest. Plus itll get you an immediate answer on if they have an opportunities that would fit your interests and abilities\n\nGood luck!",

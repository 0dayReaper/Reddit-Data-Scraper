    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m interested in applying to Neuroscience programs this cycle and am not sure which program at Caltech I should apply to - CNS or Neurobiology. I got my bachelors in Neurobiology and Psychology but am interested in systems-level neuro, not really molecular. CNS seems like a stronger program but I feel like I don\u2019t have the computational or math background. Can someone explain the differences between the two programs? There seems to be some overlap among the courses required and I assume that you are free to rotate with PIs in different departments.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "It doesn't matter. As you've found, they're basically the same program. CNS is an older program. Neurobiology was recently created to attract people who might've been confused by the CNS name, but they are, on all levels that matter, the same program (one isn't stronger than the other). I couldn't tell you the difference except that your course requirement might be \\*minorly\\* different (I wouldn't worry about this either\u2014you can take what you want) and the program representative differs. You can be purely molecular in CNS and you can do systems in Neuro. You can work with any of the faculty on the Neuro or CNS page (and more) regardless of your program.  If you apply to CNS\u2014don't worry about not having computational or math background. Really.",

One of the most important things to the admissions committee is passion and pursuit for the field you mention. If you\u2019ve done a lot more Computational/math/CS work, apply to CNS. If you\u2019ve done more bio then do neurobio. Once you\u2019re at tech you can switch to whichever. Good luck!!!\n\nEdit: also consider what you hope to do in the future. Just pick the one that fits better to your story!",

            "comment": "I'm an undergrad in CNS, but I attend the weekly pizza class for graduate students discussing current Caltech research in CNS.\n\nI do have to disagree somewhat with u/eieei. There is a lot of pure neurobio research, and it definitely skews that way over CS. However, there are researchers in the CNS department who do almost entirely CS and engineering work, such as synthesizing various types of silicon processors or creating new kinds of neural networks.\n\nKeep in mind, CNS was historically part of the EAS program, ie: engineering and applied science. If you're interested in that, by all means. I don't think a lack of CS/math background would handicap you too much; I assume you could learn it as you go. But it should be something you're interested in if you do that work! \n\nAnyways, that's my two cents. Keep in mind I am but a lowly UG",

OP won't be restricted in terms of his classes or choice of lab, and all that matters for a PhD is what lab you end up joining.\n\nTheoretically, you're right, they are different programs with different areas of focus. But it doesn't translate into anything meaningful about your experience if you were in one or the other program, at least for a grad student.\n\nAlso, what pizza?",

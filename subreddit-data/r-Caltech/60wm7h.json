Even if there is a stereotype of certain houses having more of one major than another, it's not the case where a huge percentage of a popular major all live in a particular house. An example is that Fleming is know to have a lot of people getting a BEM double major. \n\nI think that having friends in your major but not in your house is a good thing: it encourages you to go out and meet new people instead of just never leaving your dorm except to go to lab/class. A good number of people do just that.",

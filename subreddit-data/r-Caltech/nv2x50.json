To celebrate, we put on the first real Interhovse, apparently in decades.  Prior to this hovses put on their own individual \"interhovse\" parties, but for this al the hovses all threw a giant party on the same day, just like they supposedly did back in the day.\n\nThe theme of Blacker's party was \"Soviet Russia.\"  As part of this we made the dance platforms look like a giant submarine and then flooded the courtyard.  The finishing touch was that we dyed the water in the courtyard a fluorescent green color.  (The dye is totally safe and is used by the EPA to look for leaks.)  It looked great and everyone had an awesome time.\n\nEarly the next morning someone went to drain the courtyard.  However, because no one had lived in the South Hovses for a year and a half, they didn't realize that the courtyard doesn't drain directly into the sewer system.  Instead it drains out onto California Ave and from there into one of the storm drains on the street.\n\nWell, those drains aren't designed to handle an entire courtyard worth of water all at once, so when it started to drain, the water created a massive pool on California.  The upshot was that one Sunday morning, some of our neighbors across the street woke up to find an enormous pool of radioactive-looking green liquid leaking out of Caltech.\n\nA Hazmat team was called in to deal with the situation and there were helicopters, too.  Anyway Blacker was charged something in excess of $10,000 for the hazmat \"services.\"",

There was one called Playboy, which was like one of the first porn magazines.  They listed \"top 10 college parties\" and Interhouse made it to that list.\n\nBut it got absolutely ridiculous before they shut it down.  They would have to put up fences to keep people out.  Cops were called in, it was just a big mess.  Maybe there was a stabbing or two at some point in time???  That also might just be legend.  \n\nBut you know - the 1980s in LA with a bunch of teenagers....\n\nEach house had their own general theme of course.  Page would usually do some sort of ride.  If you ever catch \"Real Genius\" - the ice scene is based off of one of the Page House rides one year.\n\nIf you look in old old Big T's you can still find photos I imagine",

The wall-sized Ricketts pentagram in the dining hall (presumably removed in renovations?) was one of the lesser consequences of that night.  Non-Caltech people also tore down a chainlink perimeter fence by surging into it.",

There was one night in Hollywood when suddenly a bunch of cars started showing up, something like Wednesday and I think after midnight.\n\nThey started doing something to the stars, so we went to go investigate, and were told that it was Caltech's senior prank. They had stickers made with scientists names that they put over all the stars on the walk of fame in hollywood. It was awesome, and confused many tourists the following morning who had heard of no one.",

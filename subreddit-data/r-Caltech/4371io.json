    "postText": "I'm a student at the University of Michigan, and I just got an internship in Pasadena for the summer.  I'm looking for a place to rent a room, but all the places on airbnb are too expensive and places4students doesn't have any postings yet.  Do you know anyone who is looking to rent out their room over the summer? If it's going to sit empty anyways they might as well make some money off of it.\n\nI don't want to give too many personal details on reddit, but I will in PMs if you want.  Broadly, I'm a college-age girl into music and computer science. \n\nThanks for any tips you can give me for finding someplace to live!",

If none of those 20-something properties meet your criteria I encourage you to keep checking back as new properties are regularly added.\n\nBest of luck in your search! ",

This means you are a sub-tenant to the individual who is subletting.\n\nA property listing is one placed by a landlord in which you are the primary person signing the lease, unless specified otherwise (i.e. group lease). Property listings tend to be longer in duration of lease (6-12 months). ",

There will be 9-10 properties that match this criteria. \n\nHope this helps! ",

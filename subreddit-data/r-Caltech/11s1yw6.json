In this case, the student contacted those of us trying to unionize to help out with collective action. The admin has resisted \"outside\" intervention but has been moving positively for this case. If anything, the admin's response has been to come down hard on greater organizing efforts, as this is just one example of how students can come together to help each other - which they don't like.",

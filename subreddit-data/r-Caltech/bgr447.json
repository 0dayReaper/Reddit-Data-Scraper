    "postText": "I\u2019ve heard Caltech teams are generally really bad and I was wondering for Caltech\u2019s athletic teams how good do you have to be in order to be on the team (specifically women\u2019s volleyball)? Have a newfound interest in volleyball but no high school experience; may take it up during the summer. If I\u2019m not going to be able to make it freshman year, would I have a chance in later years? Thank you!",

    "postText": "Hi! I am super happy that I was accepted to Caltech RD this year. I will admit, however, I didn't know that much about the school going in and am a bit off-put by all of the threads about how stressful undergraduate Caltech is. I would like to know which of the following statements are exaggerated, which are true, and strategies for managing the latter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Little/No Free Time\n\n\\- Bad Administration policies (heard rumblings of this but don't know the specifics)\n\n\\- Prestige of the Caltech brand offset by a less-than stellar undergraduate GPA due to course difficulty (when applying for a job or graduate school) (I have heard people citing this when referring to Caltech as a \"huge gamble\")\n\n\\- Professors not focused enough on teaching due to being active researchers\n\n\\- Lack of social life / visiting LA and such \n\n\\- Lack of safety-net \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease note that my overall impression of Caltech is positive, and as I said before, I am super happy to get in. However, I am potentially spending four years of my life there and would like to have my reservations cleared up if possible. Thanks :)",

Keep in mind that the people who are active on this subreddit and who are likely to respond to this post are probably not a representative sample of students. (This doesn't mean their viewpoints are less valuable, just that you should remember there are other viewpoints you won't hear here.)\n\nIf you think you know what you want to study and/or what you want to do after Caltech, that would probably help us give you more accurate answers to your questions \u2013\u00a0the experience varies quite a lot from department to department. (It's fine to not know that yet though!)",

                    "comment": "My opinion on a few of the things you asked about, in general:\n\n* Teaching quality is pretty bad on average. But there are some profs and TAs who are very, very good, and it's easy to make sure you take their classes if you care about that. The one exception is, ironically, the humanities \u2013 all 12 humanities courses I took at tech were extremely well-taught.\n* It's true that the administration has become a larger, more overbearing bureaucracy over the last decade, and no longer has students' best interests at heart. That said...we still have a **lot** more freedom than students at most other universities. And most of the people who have complained about the decline (including me) don't mention that, because we're not choosing between universities.\n* You probably will not have much free time, and you probably will pull all-nighters. The workload is really, really heavy. Be ready to work your ass off. That said, as long as you can realize when you've bit off too much and drop a class, you can make it. Start practicing swallowing your pride now \u2013 the most valuable thing Caltech taught me was humility.\n* Your GPA will be somewhat lower here than it would be if you went to any other comparably prestigious institution. But most jobs don't give a shit, and grad schools that are worth your time should be familiar enough with how Caltech works to adjust it. The one exception is medical school, or anything with comparably strict GPA requirements.\n* I loved the social life, to be honest. I loved my house and the people in it, and loved that it led me to make friends with people from other majors and other years. I loved our parties and traditions, that we all had dinner together every night, and the good-natured rivalry between houses. I also met my partner of five years at Caltech, which would have made the whole thing worth it alone :)",

            "comment": "It's been a while since I graduated, but the adage about Tech being \"like drinking from a fire hose\" felt really accurate in the early 00s. You spend a boatload of time working on problem sets, the student body is small, brilliant, and weird, and you get out of your classes as much or as little as you put in. No one was there holding your hand to make sure you did well (except maybe your Housemates). Failure WAS an option. But the access to productive, top rate professors and research opportunities was unparalleled. I can't imagine it's changed THAT much since then. Some people excel in such an environment, and others flame out. It depends on how strong your high school education was, what your major is, and your personality. If you like to rise to a challenge Tech might be a good fit. If you want more of a traditional college experience you might consider an alternative school.",

In general, teaching quality was not good, but I might be misjudging teaching quality if the material was beyond me. Classes taught by instructors who didn't do research tended to be taught better. I also liked the instruction in the foreign language classes I took.\n\nMost of the people I knew did not have much free time. Social lives tended to center around problem sets and to be within the student houses. The houses would have parties once or twice a quarter. If you want to go out beyond Pasadena, you need a car or a friend with a car. You can reach downtown LA and some other places using the metro, but for the most part, public transit is slow with insufficient coverage.\n\nWhen I was a student, I recall that there were rumblings about the administration listening to students, but I didn't really pay attention. More recently, students have been concerned about the administration killing the student houses' unique cultures by changing Rotation and adding a new residence that seems to be more generic. Overall, I didn't care that much for house culture, but it is very important to some students.\n\nIt is true that Caltech grades tend to be deflated. It might not be that much of an issue for grad school because most quality grad schools should know Caltech's reputation. However, I've heard that this is an issue for med school. Most jobs don't care about GPA. FWIW, the alumni from my class seem to be doing well for themselves overall, including in academia. I have been relatively less successful, despite a good GPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Sophomore in Bioengineering here, so keep in mind that what I\u2019ve seen so far has mostly been core courses. \n\nFree time is certainly in short supply. Most people take a lot of classes, and that means that you can\u2019t do a lot of things that aren\u2019t classes. In most majors (maybe not physics, and some others) it is possible to distribute graduation requirements in a way that is not going to kill you, but the material has been so exciting for me that I\u2019ve taken 48-51 units every term, and this is common. \n\nAdministration seems to me like they do their best, given that you accept that they have the University\u2019s best interests in mind, not yours. \n\nI can\u2019t speak about what classes are like from other institutions, but I have found nearly all of my classes extremely worthwhile. Sometimes lecture can be useless, sometimes recitation is useless, sometimes office hours are unhelpful, and sometimes the textbook is incomprehensible, but I\u2019ve never had all of these happen at once. Furthermore, I\u2019ve been surrounded by peers who have gone out of their way to help me understand my courses. The problem sets have been extremely challenging, but this is usually because they demand a complete understanding of difficult material at a fast pace. \n\nI really think the support for classes is quite good. For example, I was stuck on a problem a few hours before my Ph 12 Set was due, found my professor (a 3 minute walk from my dorm room), and in-between meetings with graduate students he was willing to help me understand the problem. I\u2019m in group chats for 4 of my classes where I can organize study groups and get help. \n\nIf school has been too easy so far, and you love science and math, this is the best place I can imagine. If you would rather learn at a reasonable pace, rather than from a firehose, or you are unwilling to work insane hours and want a GPA around 4, then you should have reservations. ",

            "comment": "I think you can expect some of these to be a serious problem for you, and some much less so. The issue is that it is extremely difficult to predict *which* of 1-6 will be relevant for you, which is a pain because some are probably bigger dealbreakers than others, depending on what you're looking for from your school.\n\nFor example, I mostly taught myself from books and the internet for my first 3 years, fell straight through one of the gaping holes in the safety net, and was completely isolated from all of the house communities for most of the time I spent in Pasadena. For entirely related reasons, I did no research at Caltech. On the other hand, my grades were great, I often had enough down time (relatively speaking; I didn't graduate on time so there's that), and admin treated me pretty fairly the one time I ran afoul of the rules (and got caught). So 4-6 hit me very hard and I couldn't care less about 1-3; my impression is that the other way around is more common but at a place like Caltech pretty much everyone is idiosyncratic. And after all that I got into top grad schools and feel like my life trajectory is more or less on track.\n\nAs you can tell by other comments, people tend to disagree about which of these is the most important, but they are all real. The other side of this coin is that for each of these issues it is definitely possible to go through tech without experiencing that issue. I personally think Caltech was pretty close to optimal for me as an undergrad, but I can only say that in retrospect; it definitely didn't feel like it at the time.   ",

            "comment": "1. True. Very little free time compared to other top schools.\n\n2. True, though many people don't care. It really saps your morale if you do, though. \n\n3. Partly true. The name carries a lot of weight. Your ability to do research at the school is super important and likely to way more important to a future career in science, because you'll get faculty recs based off of that research and they're invaluable. The hit in the GPA is easily offset by that one factor, provided you're planning on grad school. \n\n4. True. Teachers at Caltech are somewhat worse than at other schools, but other schools have classes of several hundred and Caltech does not. It's a mixed bag. I'd ultimately say it's a small loss but not insurmountable. \n\n5. Very true. Social lives at Caltech are very different from other schools. Far fewer parties and far fewer opportunities. Not sure what the male/female breakdown is now, but that was a massive social issue for a long time. (Anything that isn't 50/50 leads to incredibly weird scenes.) Your chances of \"finding yourself\" in some niche at Caltech are just as high as at other schools, but with the massive caveat that there are far fewer niches and you might not *love* any of them.\n\n6. I can't comment - the radical changes to the house system might have impacted this in a severely negative way, but I don't know. I'd say that it is a *lot* harsher than other schools and that there's no real way to have an adequate net for everyone, which honestly kind of sucks.\n\n\\#3 is the heart of your decision. I'd focus on seeing if you care about that more than any other thing. If not, it's an easy no. If you do, then it's a maybe.",

Students generally know what is happening and external bullshit like this paints Caltech as a series of comically ignorant stereotypes not the informed and passionate population of scientists it is. Minority students are here at Caltech doing the same if not more than the average student with regards to research, leadership, and academics. They all got here by their own merit. In fact, a major criticism of Caltech is that the bar of pure meritocracy is in fact too restrictive to minority students. Hasan Minhaj's Patriot Act episode on the Harvard Affirmative Action Supreme Court case does a good job with starting this conversation, if you have interest in some very easy research. You clearly just want to poke your head in and spread rumors about a space which you know nothing about. It isn't a good look. \n\nAnd spell Caltech right, you needlessly pseudo-racist provocateur.

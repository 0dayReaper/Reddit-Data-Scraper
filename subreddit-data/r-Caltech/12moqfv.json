    "postText": "Hi! I am looking to stay off-campus in an apartment for the duration of SURF (a few days before June 21 to August 25). I am wondering if anyone staying in an apartment has a room available for the summer or if someone is subletting their room. And if not, how should I go about finding somewhere off-campus to stay in for the summer, or do you recommend staying on campus?",

Need off-campus from 11-21 June, and if it turns out costly, I might do the SURF entirely off-campus(monthly rent &lt;$1000 for some places)\n\n  \nAlso, You may join the official discord server where you might get more responses and interact with others: [https://discord.gg/vAWZE9aXSW](https://discord.gg/vAWZE9aXSW)",

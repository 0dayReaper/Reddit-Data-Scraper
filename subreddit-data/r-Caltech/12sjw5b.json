            "comment": "Transferring to caltech is extremely difficult. Iirc, we accept ~5 a year, and mostly through a 3/2 type program from other schools. Caltech is also quite stringent on allowing credits to transfer, since our courses tend to be much more rigorous than their equivalents at other universities, let alone community colleges. Most transfers end up spending 5 years total between their original school and caltech, which somewhat negates the point of taking classes elsewhere and then transferring here.",

It\u2019s awful. Honestly idk what to think anymore. Is anywhere in America safe for blacks?? I guess we don\u2019t have cops on campus, but still. It\u2019s just so ridiculous that blacks are persecuted so much at Caltech. We have almost NO black kids here at the school. Why? Admissions is racist. And we all hate racists. ",

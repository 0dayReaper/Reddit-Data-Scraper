    "postText": "So, honest opinion. Caltech or CalPoly for Aerospace Engineering, with a focus on the Space side of Aerospace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week we toured both schools (and Mudd) and ruled out Mudd. Both Caltech and CalPoly SLO seem to be amazing schools. We only got the outdoor tour at Caltech, so we didn't see any of the labs. At CalPoly we were able to go into some engineering buildings and saw their wind tunnels and other aerospace-specific facilities, and looked at their course curriculum for BA - Aerospace\n\n[https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofengineering/aerospaceengineering/bsaerospaceengineering/](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofengineering/aerospaceengineering/bsaerospaceengineering/)\n\nand the concentration in Astronautics:\n\n[https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofengineering/aerospaceengineering/bsaerospaceengineering/astronauticsconcentration/](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofengineering/aerospaceengineering/bsaerospaceengineering/astronauticsconcentration/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat curriculum looks REALLY compelling. Campus was nice too.\n\nI feel like Caltech is a stronger school and certainly more exclusive and impressive. Has anyone here done an aerospace minor at Caltech and how would you say the curriculum and facilities stack up against what CalPoly is offering?\n\nAny other factors that should be considered?\n\nOne option might be to do undergrad at Poly and grad at Caltech later.",

If you are &gt;90% sure you want to get a PhD or if you've always pictured yourself as a professor at a tier 1 research university then Calltech for sure. If you know you want a career in industry, maybe after getting a masters degree, Cal Poly for sure. \n\nAlso, this isn't really a question until you're admitted. No harm applying to both schools, and there's a very chance that will make the decision for you.",

Caltech gets applications for more quality students than they can ever hope to admit, so even if you are a student within reach it can still come down to luck.",

Employers only care about the last thing you did.  If you get into both and pick Caltech, great, but if you do well at Cal Poly you're not closing off any options.\n\nIf you're interested in space, getting involved with projects at JPL would be much easier as a Caltech student.\n\nGood luck!",

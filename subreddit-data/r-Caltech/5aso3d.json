    "postText": "Got an email from my professor asking to sign up for an internship summer of 17. The email, and a little googling didn't reveal much about the program itself. I'm a 2nd year computer science major in CC, I haven't found a specialty yet, but I want to make sure if I sign up for this and get accepted I'm not wasting my time by not being knowledgeable enough for the program.  \n\nFYI, the email was sent to everyone not me specifically. I'm okay in math, though I'm struggling slightly in precalculus. Chances are I'd be done with calculus I after spring but if not I'd be done with precalc.  Programming is going much better for me and I've always been a quick learner for anything with hardware.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2018m a master student from ETH Z\u00fcrich and wanted to ask for tips regarding applying for a PhD at Caltech. In general at ETH, one can directly apply to the professor of their choice simply by contacting them via email. As what i\u2018ve heard, this is significantly different in the US, where there are designated application webpages. Now my questions is what is the exact procedure? How can one still choose the field of research of their choice and what are the do\u2018s and don\u2019t\u2018s along the application process. Very grateful for any tips or shared experiences. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming Caltech PhD student who applied last cycle. I think some of the other comments thought you were referring to undergrad admissions. For graduate admissions in the US, there is no common app. Each university will have an online application\u2014 unfortunately, this means you will have to fill out a lot of the same information multiple times. The Caltech graduate app is [here](https://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/admissions/applyonline). \n\nThe app will allow you to select your program and field of research. Something that\u2019s different about PhD programs in the US is that when you\u2019re admitted, you\u2019re not bound to working for a specific advisor or even within the field you indicated on your app (as long as it\u2019s within your program\u2014 for instance, if I applied to physics as a condensed matter physicist I could switch to, say, cosmology if I really wanted to. I probably couldn\u2019t start working in a biology lab without reapplying, though). All US applications will ask you to write a personal statement, in which you discuss your research interests and advisors you want to work for at that institution. You can email Caltech professors you\u2019re interested in working for if you want, but they may not reply and even if they do, and they\u2019re excited about your app, you may still not get in. \n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "In the US, you generally apply to the department you'd like to join, not the university as a whole or the professor. Each department has their own requirements and procedures for admissions. For example, the Applied Physics &amp; Materials department is somewhat unusual in that they don't actually admit students until after a visiting weekend where a subset of prospective students are flown out for interviews. \n\nMost PhD programs in STEM admin directly from your undergrad BS without an intermediate MS. You get your MS after a year or two, and, if you're directly admitted on the PhD path, it'll be paid for. In general, if you're admitted without funding it's considered a soft rejection, basically saying you're in, but you need to count on winning an external fellowship to pay your way (or have parents who don't care about the cost).\n\nOften, as part of your application to a department, you'll write a personal statement or a statement about your research interests. You'll want to identify a few specific faculty members you'd want to work with, and try to target them in the statement. You, generally, shouldn't attend a school if there is only a single faculty member you want to work with. Sometimes their planned funding for you may fall through, your personalities may not mesh, or they might get hit by a bus. Departments know this, so they want to be sure there's a fallback plan or more than one faculty member who would want you in their lab. For my department, I think you needed three faculty members say they'd take you in order to get admitted.",

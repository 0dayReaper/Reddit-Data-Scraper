Each alley chose its theme and everyone claimed one wall in that alley as a canvas for that theme.  Some time after I graduated, the tradition stopped, and so many of the paintings on the walls in Page date back to my time there almost 20 years ago, including two that I painted.",

Without significantly warm clothing or bedding. On a night that it rained. That's pretty much the entire story, it went about as well as you might expect (we did spend the night. There was ice on the tents when we woke up LOL)\n\nActually fun story: We also hung a zip line across the courtyard for a couple days, super fun!",

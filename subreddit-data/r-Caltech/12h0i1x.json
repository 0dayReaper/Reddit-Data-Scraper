    "postText": "Hey y'all, possible incoming PhD student here with a question about off-campus housing options. My partner is possibly going to be at UC Riverside, so was wondering if anyone knows a feasible place to live between the two schools that is nice enough, relatively affordable, and splits the commute pretty evenly (assuming we both have our own transportation). I know it would be pretty non-ideal especially with traffic but am willing to deal with a bit of a painful commute to live together. Thanks!",

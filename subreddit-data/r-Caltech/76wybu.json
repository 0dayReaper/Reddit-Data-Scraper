You can order it but unfortunately they don't ship it.\n\nWhen I told her you were no longer around Caltech she offered this piece of advice: a cake that is pretty similar is the chocolate cake at Claim Jumper. So there's that.\n\nGood luck! If you're ever in Pasadena please let me know. I'll split a cake with you. Seriously, I love that goddamn cake.",

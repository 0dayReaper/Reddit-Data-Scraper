    "postText": "Hello, I was recently accepted off of the Columbia waitlist and am now deciding between these two schools. So first, I know that Caltech is indisputably more reputable than Columbia for STEM. However, I\u2019m not entirely sure if I want to go into heavy technical STEM. But regardless of that, I know that like any top university, the best students are equal in ability. It\u2019s more the lower bound that differs drastically since Caltech has a much smaller class size. This brings me to my main point: I think academically, no matter where I go I\u2019m going to work hard to become the best version of myself academically. However, I think my growth as an individual would drastically differ depending on the school I choose. I\u2019ve heard of people that love Caltech, but I\u2019ve also talked to many people who sort of regret it. This is what I\u2019m scared of. I feel like it\u2019s much easier to burnout at Caltech than it is to at Columbia, but that\u2019s just off of my conversations with people from both schools about their time there. Would you say that it\u2019s necessary to go to a school as academically intense as Caltech? I\u2019m pretty sure Caltech is the hardest undergraduate experience of any college, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s meant for me. I see my goals as a displacement, where I can get to the same place I want to be, but the journey at Caltech seems much harder than Columbia. Do you think it\u2019s worth it? The smartest people I\u2019ve met went to Caltech for PhDs, and went to a whole myriad of different undergraduate universities. But that\u2019s the thing, they never really burned out in undergrad which is how they got to that level for higher education. I\u2019m scared if I go to Caltech I may burn out as I\u2019ve seen in a few ppl that go there. Thanks so much for the taking the time to read this, any insights are appreciated.",

            "comment": "I would definitely say Columbia. The fact that you're this apprehensive now, will fill you with so much regret about having made the \"wrong\" decision at the most stressful of times at Caltech that you won't be able to cope. I personally have 0 regrets about Caltech, and had 0 regrets about Caltech while I was there, but if I'd been as undecided as you sound, I don't think I would have made it through at all.\n\nAlso, burn-out is very real. I was completely drained of all \"intellectual curiosity\" for like 2-3 years after graduation, and it wasn't until like 4 years later that I decided oh right I actually loved math &amp; coding and I actually kinda do want to be a developer ok fine lol. In the long run it's worked out fine for me, and the net experience has been that Caltech prepared me fantastically for learning stuff on my own in an *exceedingly* nontraditional career, but the only way I'd recommend Caltech is if you are certain that not only do you want the environment it has, but that you wouldn't be happy anywhere else. Which is true for some people! But it doesn't sound true for you. So Columbia 100% and I think you'll do great there :)",

            "comment": "Go to Columbia. Caltech's intensity is definitely excessive, and it makes it much harder to pursue GPA sensitive things (like med school. Never ever go to Caltech if you want to go to med school). You sound like you want a more well rounded college experience, rather than a super intense, tightly STEM focused college experience with good research opportunities. Columbia is a better fit for that. And if it turns out that you want the intense STEM, I'm sure you can talk to profs and find good research opportunities at Columbia. If you don't want what Caltech offers, you would be incredibly unhappy there.\n\nBoth schools have brilliant reputations, so deciding between them based on how you think that'll be perceived is kind of excessive.",

I think Caltech makes it easier to go to graduate school, but I\u2019m concerned about whether the rigor of the academics is worth it for an undergraduate experience. I feel like going to Caltech for a PhD would be more beneficial than for undergrad, for instance. How would you categorize the social scene at Caltech? I\u2019m the type of person that really likes STEM, but wouldn\u2019t be talking about new breakthroughs from NASA in my free time if that makes any sense.",

A more normal college and then Caltech for grad definitely seems to work better. Don't brush off the importance of good mental health! It's really hard to get good grades if you end up struggling with your mental well-being.\n\nI'm similar, and I basically liked Caltech's social scene. I was the normal one, where I'd always been the weird one before, but I mostly liked the people. I'm not sure of the current situation, but dating at Caltech was really screwy when I was there: the ratio wasn't *that* uneven, but it wasn't evenly distributed within the houses, and that made things weird in a bad way too often (I was in a more skewed house). I have no idea how it is now though. And I'm sure you'll find similarly nerdy people at Columbia if you hang around certain departments (like the math department), but with much more opportunity to meet people with broader interests and experiences as well. In particular, there should be the numbers at Columbia to make it easier to do interesting things with those broad interests.",

But it's not that you'd be miserable socially: it's that being able to de-stress primarily through STEM hobbies is a really strong predictor of keeping your sanity at Tech. I do math for fun, but I still needed too much non-STEM time to stay sane at Tech.",

To that end, having met a few Caltech students, and having worked in a lab there for a summer, I think you are right to be wary of burnout -- the students have a lot expected of them from the get-go, but if you truly love the material, you won't find many comparable places [in the world] to meet highly intelligent and like-minded people. I don't know as much about Columbia, but I suspect their department would be no slouch in this department either.\n\nHonestly though, I would probably let the tiebreaker be more about where you have to live to attend each school. Caltech is in Pasadena. While you will probably live on campus all four years, developing a fraternity-esque bond with your housemates, it's got a bit of an upper-class suburb vibe in the surrounding area. It's a nice place but nothing particularly exciting. On the other hand, Columbia is right there in NYC, with all the positives and negatives that come with big city life. That may be appealing to you, or it may be a big reason to stay away depending on what you want. Just know that they are very different ways of life, and making sure you live in a place you like will significantly help with keeping you from burning out.",

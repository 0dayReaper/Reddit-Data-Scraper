    "postText": "I got around pretty much all Bs freshman year (high school by the way) but i have gotten all As since then and the most intense math and science possible at my school. My UW gpa is still 3.6 from that which is far below caltech's average. I don't struggle with math and science it's just that I was going through some personal problems freshman year and pretty much never did homework.\n\n Do you guys think it's worth applying? Looking this up is hard to tell a good answer and I don't really know how much my freshman year will impact my chances. Honesty is appreciated :).",

            "comment": "Yes, you should still apply. Emphasize how you\u2019ve grown since freshman year (and in doing so turned your grades around) in at least one of your essays, it will help. Admissions officers love to see growth, and your grades seem perfectly competitive from after freshman year, which helps a lot.",

I'm not saying that that makes it better or worse necessarily, but the culture of the school and undergraduate experience at the school is not the same.\n\nIt's extremely small, the smallest highly regarded school in the country by far excepting the Claremont Colleges, which has a huge impact on campus life. It also has the House System, which is unique and lends itself to a very distinct undergraduate community. Undergraduate courses at Caltech are also harder and much faster paced than comparable courses at nearly any other school in the country. The honor code is also different, especially with regards to allowing increased collaboration and universal take home exams.",

    "postText": "My niece is going to be crossing from the east coast to attend Caltech this year and I wanted to pick her up a few things. \n\nBesides the obvious notebooks, pens, etc., are there are niche items that have made your life easier?\n\nI was thinking of getting her some caltech merch (Hoodie sweater), a lanyard (I recall always needing my school ID handy back when I was in college), a gift card to HiroNori, and... hopefully something else that's useful?\n\nEDIT: are there backpacks the kids are into nowadays? Everyone I knew used to be obsessed with LL Bean.",

One of the more common restaurants if you\u2019re looking to give out gift cards is TeaSpots, that may be a good thing to give her.",

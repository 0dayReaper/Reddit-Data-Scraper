    "postText": "I\u2019m a high school sophomore, and when I was looking at some XC/Track page for MIT, I saw that mile time had to be under 4:37, which I\u2019m not totally sure I can get by the end of senior year. However, I\u2019m very committed to running, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do otherwise. Is there a club at Caltech that a lot of slower people are in or something? Or is it small enough that anyone who wants to be is on the team?",

I love the ideas of a school with the same number of students as my high school, the honor system, being able to run with a group that cares but isn\u2019t necessarily as whack as the MIT runners, and since I don\u2019t actually know anybody from Caltech. Also, I\u2019ve never been very far west, and MIT is pretty close to me, which I\u2019m not a huge fan of, although carrying my luggage across the entire country also seems like a lot.",

Realize that physics at Caltech is hard, and you are no match for the actual geniuses at Caltech\n\nStep 3. Realize that you've gone too far and it's too late to switch majors, but that your GPA sucks and so does grad school, and even if you switch majors, physics is hard but everything else is also hard at Caltech\n\nStep 4. Realize that the CS majors are living the good life and realize that \"hey I can code a little\" and that modern physics research is just bad software engineering + data analytics + eccentric fun facts, and that you will be employable and make decent money straight out of college if you just switch into finance\n\nStep 5. Have an existential crisis\n\nStep 6. Start applying to Finance jobs and realize that Caltech's education prepares you pretty well for a finance job and your credentials are a lot better than you think they are\n\nStep 7. Sell out and go into finance right out of college\n\n:^ )",

It's one of the best chemistry departments in the world, and also one of the departments at Caltech where the student-to-faculty ratio is as good as they advertise, so you'll have no problem getting research with a top-tier professor. Admissions doesn't make mistakes. If that is your passion, seize the opportunity to pursue it.\n\nAs TangerineX says, if you burn out you can probably fall back on finance. If finance is really your top priority and interest, there are better places to pursue it than Caltech.",

            "comment": "I was doing the CS/BEM route before I took an indefinite sabbatical to go work as a software engineer. If you're interested in finance, take some BEM classes and see what you like. I recommend BEM 103 and BEM 104 at the very least. If you're interested in quantitative finance, I've been told BEM 105 is a must.\n\nThe opportunities at Caltech seemed to be good. Many of my classmates ended up in finance. I personally knew students who went to Citadel, D.E. Shaw, Jump Trading, and Goldman Sachs. I also attended recruiting events by Two Sigma, Jane Street, Morgan Stanley, and TGS Management. Every year there was a \"finance panel\" where successful alumni and trustees came to campus to speak to undergraduates and I was able to get 1-on-1 meetings with MDs at major investment banks and receive helpful advice.\n\nThere's an active [data science club](http://datascience.caltech.edu/) at Caltech that is sponsored by Citadel. There's also an [investing club](http://sif.caltech.edu/) that apparently has been around since 1978.\n\nCaveat: if your goal is to become an investment banker and you've also been accepted to a top Ivy, Caltech may not be the best option. You'll likely work a lot harder, have a lot less free time to spend on non-classwork, and have a lower GPA when you graduate. You'll also witness investment banks being mocked for their shady practices and questionable products, which can discouraging. But if you want to learn a shitload of math and science and maybe become a quant, I think Caltech is a pretty good choice.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck!",

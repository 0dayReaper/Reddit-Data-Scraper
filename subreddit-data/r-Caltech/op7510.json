            "comment": "Unfortunately there just aren't many pictures of caltech dorm rooms online. The rooms vary depending on what dorm they are in. They are about 180 Sq feet for a double and bedding is either bunk beds, waist level beds, or lofted beds where there is an elevated platform with the beds on top. \n\nThe rooms pretty much all come with a dresser, a desk, and a lot of closet space and other storage space. Depending on the room, you should have room for a sizeable couch as well as other items.\n\nHope this helps and feel free to DM if you want more info!",

The 3 north houses look a bit more like concrete 60s  architecture and are all doubles. The newest house- Avery- is a mix of undergrads, grads, and visiting profs, has both singles and doubles. stock room images: http://www.housing.caltech.edu/Undergrads/undergrad/Avery   \n\n\nEven within a house, the rooms may have a ranges of size and shape. What will be same- all have a window, a closet (or two if a double) and an in-room sink. There's a pool of undergrad housing furniture (beds, bunks, mattresses, dressers, desks).  \n\n\nYou may try searching for the individual house pages for more images, though looks like it's currently Rotation (when new freshmen rotate through the houses and submit their picks), so all public-facing sites are temporarily locked down and will be for a few weeks.  \n\n\nIndividual house links listed: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House\\_System\\_at\\_the\\_California\\_Institute\\_of\\_Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology)  \n\n\nGood luck!",

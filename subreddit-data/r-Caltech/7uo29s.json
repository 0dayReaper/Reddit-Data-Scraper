    "postText": "This morning, Vice President for Student Affairs Joe Shepherd released a housing plan that, on pages 7-10, puts an end to Rotation (and therefore the House system) as we know it.\n\nUpperclassmen will no longer be involved in the sorting of freshmen into Houses, and the freshmen\u2019s preferences will be the sole determining factor in their assignment. The explicit goal is for freshmen to ultimately choose where they will live before they ever arrive on campus.\n\nThe verdict was made unilaterally and inserted at the last minute to a housing plan years in the making. The students who were involved in the plan's creation were not notified of the change until late last night. You can read the document for yourself here https://studaff.caltech.edu/documents/71-bechtelplan-2-1-2018_final.pdf (Rotation material starts on page 7.)\n\nThe House system is the foundation of undergraduate excellence at Caltech \u2013\u00a0our honor code, our academic success, and our recruiting efforts depend on it. House communities are also a critical part of the mental health safety net that keeps Techers sane and alive.\n\nA threat to the House system is a threat to the continued existence of Caltech as a first-class undergraduate institution, and an affront to the entire Caltech undergraduate and alumni population.\n\nThis is likely the biggest threat the House system has faced since its founding in 1931.\n\nIf you want to make your voice heard, submit a comment at https://studaff.caltech.edu/bechtel/comment or contact Student Affairs at (626) 395-6100.",

I think it was actually a large change made without the support of the student body (iirc even those living in Avery at the time were against the change).  Originally when Avery was turned into a house it definitely seemed like the goal was to give a whitewashed view of the house system.  Did Avery develop a distinct culture over time?  Did it ever shed the reputation as the least social house?  Did Avery's \"success\" end up being an argument in favor of the house system not being important at all to some?",

Caltech selects for students that would in my opinion dramatically benefit from at least some pressure.  Plenty of students lived in the houses and still didn't socialize.  Caltech has a large number of introverts, even in the \"wilder\" houses, but what Avery does, in my opinion, is create an environment where the majority of people you're surrounded by are also introverts.  Anyways, I'm not trying to debate as to whether Avery should have been made into a house in the first place (although not trying to hide that I did and continue to have an opinion about).  The point I was trying to make is that Avery's bland, traditional dormitory-style personality gave a permission structure for the University to get rid of all of the personality in undergraduate life.",

Other than the different student population at Caltech than at those schools, I don't think that the experience would be all that different than any other university.  The housing system was unique, it created an experience that very few other universities (certainly no large universities) could replicate.  I think Avery being added was in my opinion \"what if we made a dorm and called it a house\".  Then they're like \"I guess it worked out fine, let's make all the houses into dorms\".\n\nhttps://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1912/1/2004_05_17_105_27.pdf\n\nUGs opposed making Avery a house by a 5 to 1 margin, and the university did it anyways.

There have been a ton of changes to the campus and houses over the decades and it turns out that none of them have destroyed the school or student life. The houses have all evolved over time as new students have moved in. As a witness to some pretty horrific ranking meetings, a massive overhaul of rotation sounds like a solid plan.

The students at Stanford are also happy too and I don't think things need to stay the same just for the sake of staying the same, but the student body rotates through every 4 years, the administration slowly makes Caltech into the 2nd best (wonder if it even properly gets this title) Stanford in California instead of choosing to continue to be the best Caltech in the world.\n\nI feel like my time away from tech has given me a different perspective especially working with people from many different universities both with science and non-science backgrounds.  My colleagues from Caltech really have been something special.  There have been amazing people I've worked with from all over, but still, you can always seem to feel the difference Caltech makes (both regularly high quality and a certain style of creativity) and I think it's worth exploring what makes Caltech special and to make sure it's not lost.  \n\nMy experience at Caltech was not perfect, there are a lot of things I wish the university did better, but the house system was never one of those for me.  When people ask me if I would go to Caltech again my honest answer is probably not, but it comes with a huge regret knowing that some of the most amazing people I've known in my life and many life-long friends are people I met while I was there.  With the changes over the years, and the problems the university has continually failed to address, if I was 18 now and deciding whether or not to go there (with the full knowledge of how it was then and how it is now), it would be an easy NO.",

                            "comment": "In general, the tone of the decision reads like COUCH agreed with him 100% and were the ones to suggest most of it, when it fact they were as surprised as any of us, but I'll give you some specific examples too.\n\nKeep in mind that any quotes were in response to \"who should live in Bechtel?\" The possibility of changing rotation or roompicks was not discussed at all, and students were not aware their quotes would be applied to those. I can't say anything for sure, since I wasn't on COUCH, but these ones seem fairly likely to have been taken out of context: \n\n\nQuote:\n\"The COUCH also recognized that there were issues in residential life associated with the House system, and proposed that:\n\u201cBy restructuring the housing system through Bechtel, we hope to make new students feel more comfortable with where they live and ensure an adequate number of options.\u201d\"\n\nContext: \n\"Under the current system, there can be pressure for freshmen to choose a house, regardless of whether they wanted to take part in the system. Although there is an option for freshmen to opt-out of the House system, the high social cost of opting out can make this choice unattractive. There are also concerns that the house environments are not beneficial for all freshmen. By restructuring the housing system through Bechtel, we hope to make new students feel more comfortable with where they live and ensure an adequate number of options.\"\n\nSo a quote suggesting rotation maybe should be made opt-in was taken to mean the houses are bad.\n\n\nQuote:\n\"The board plan is being re-examined with the goal of providing a dining experience that will enable greater choice in both the number and variety of meals. Some of our students, on and off campus, have identified the dining experience as an important element for all residences, not just Bechtel. The COUCH Subcommittee on Unaffiliated Housing focused extensively on this issue and made a number of suggestions. These include phasing out waited dinners in selected residences (dinner in Bechtel will be cafeteria style with no waiters) to reduce cost and provide more choice, eliminating the declining balance in favor of \u201cThe Anytime\u201d dining plan described below, using Chandler as a dining option in the evening, and providing more flexibility in dining times, particularly for athletes.\"\n\nContext: The report on Unaffiliated Housing is on pages 40-49. Stuff about board and dining they mention:\n\nSome students like to cook their own meals. Providing students ingredients to cook on their own is an idea currently being discussed by dining.\n\n\"Other issues include how Board will  be merged with Bechtel. Through our conversations with Jon Webster, it seems that the unaffiliated option allows the most flexibility and least impact on how Board can be implemented. ~10% of students in off-campus residences (except Marks-Braun) cited Board cost as the primary factor in moving off campus (Fig. 2), with ~56% citing it as a contributing factor (Fig. 3). So, we deemed it important to gauge the impact of any housing option on possible Board cost increases. After discussions with [the person in charge of Caltech Dining Services], it seems that students will need to be on Board, though Dining is open to modifying Board as a whole to create a more desired meal plan.  \n\nBecause student waiters present a significant part of the cost of undergraduate dinners \u2013 ~10% of the non-dBal Board price, according to [the person in charge of Caltech Dining Services] \u2013 the presence of student waiters in Bechtel will be a significant cost. Especially because of the upcoming minimum wage increase, housing options that require student waiters (such as making Bechtel its own House), might result in  undesired Board cost increases. Having Bechtel as an unaffiliated residence  will require no student waiters, making it a cheaper  option, which  would  better appeal to the 56% of students citing Board cost in moving off campus. \"\n\nThe only recommendation is that Bechtel not have waited dinners, and that letting students cook their own meal might be nice. So those recommendations listed are those of the writer, even though he makes it sound otherwise. It's possible that at least some of those were mentioned verbally, but given how surprised everyone was by \"phasing out waited dinners in selected residences,\" I really doubt all of them were.\n\n\nQuote:\n\"This system is unique to Caltech and, in the assessment of some of our students, one of the key problems with our current House system.\n\u201cThe current House System and Rotation has a plethora of challenges and weaknesses that must be addressed. Regardless of how Bechtel is filled, Rotation in particular should be thoroughly examined and decisively revised.\u201d \n- The COUCH subcommittee report on All-Freshman Housing\"\n\nSure, but they didn't mean it should be changed with no student input. That'd be like someone saying \"I want this cooking revised\" and someone interpreting it to mean they want their cauliflower to be charred crispy rather than merely overcooked.\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, though, COUCH is mostly upset about the general tone of having their approval stamped on without their consent, rather than any specific misquote.",

Given that I see a lot of value being derived from it, and don't think the reasons behind this change are well founded, I think removing the house system kills something that makes Caltech special compared to other peer institutions that have comparable academics.\n\nTo get more specific, I think that the proposed changes would neuter student autonomy (they'd remove what little remaining say student government still has on campus by putting appointed, not elected, faculty and students in our representative body), and severely restrict the kinds of cultures that can arise by enforced homogeneity via changes to rotation and roompicks. I feel that both of these things are critical components to an education beyond outright academics and are things I think the house system well promotes. (I also personally feel as though the community provided by the house system improves my academics).\n\nI also think that the proposed system is wholly inadequate in providing for the student body's needs even if the house system were to end and so would actually do net harm as a replacement. Reading the proposal (specifically the parts about rotation, roompicks, and residency requirements) it comes across as half baked and very distant from the actual issues students face on these topics. I think these parts of the proposal suffer badly from a lack of student input or any sort of respect or understanding of student life (getting more specific on the bullet points here would run pretty long, but this is how i feel).\n\nAdditionally, I was on the student committee that was involved in writing the student recommendation on Bechtel, and was blindsided by all of these parts of the proposal. I think that these parts read as very much drawn from the personal opinions and predjudices of the VPSA Joe sheperd (Dean Gilmartin is on record saying the VPSA intentionally kept these parts of the proposal from the student committee), and so also have philosophical problems with the way the proposal was made even beyond my disagreements with its content and my personal feelings of defense for the house system.",

I had good friends in most of the houses and found the \"us-vs-them\" attitude that resulted from the house system to be off putting. Individual houses tend to have much less diversity than the undergraduate population as a whole because Rotation leads to Freshmen and existing house membership selecting for like-minded housemates.",

I was impressed by a place that aimed to create great thinkers in any field who were well versed in everything, where even English majors studied quantum.\n\nAs a young student most people aren\u2019t very good at planning. Having a roadmap that guided me through the curriculum on the quarter system and required those science classes above and beyond the requirements of other schools was the defining benefit for me, especially when planned out by very qualified staff. Now, on the master\u2019s program at Harvard where I haven\u2019t even seen an equation in two years, I thoroughly miss Caltech\u2019s approach to learning. It definitely is distinctive and I don\u2019t think you can get \"95%\" of it or even 50% in many other top institutions.\n\nIf the primary reason to go to Caltech is the house system, then Caltech has become a tourist attraction and has made education a sideshow. That's a disservice to students because the focus becomes less on directly improving the ability of students to learn safely and more on the preservation of traditions that are a mixed bag of good and also very bad impacts.",

However, I often found the demands of traditions interfering with my ability to study. Upper classmen banging on your door every half hour while you're trying to study for a quiz until you come out to build a house party set definitely made my grades slip. Hazing and making you drink excessive amounts of alcohol, with a high chance of developing a dependency was also a distraction.\n\nMy senior year I ended up having to extract myself from a dangerous situation involving a mentally unstable student who wanted to shoot up the school who somehow thought I was their only friend and confided in me, because I was the only person who didn't engage in the fratboy like behavior of page and tease or bully him. My own house provided very little support in the situation or even involvement. Despite being a pageboy, it was the Ricketts house RA who ended up helping me, when I had totally run out of options. \n\nThe excessive mental stress and lack of support and the tendency of houses to try and handle things internally without reaching out to the administration compounded this and I failed several classes before the situation resolved and the unstable student was removed to a mental facility, a cache of weapons was seized, and he was properly treated (able to return two quarters later in good mental health), without risk of retaliation against me.\n\nI ended up having to stay an extra year because of my failed classes and moved off campus. That year due to the lessened distractions and the check-ins with administration on my wellbeing, I actually massively improved my grades.\n\nI feel that when it comes to emotional distress the house system does a pretty okay job of consoling students, but when it comes to real problems that require additional action, the houses tend to distrust authority figures and tries to convince people they are overreacting and sweep things under the rug that really shouldn't be, because they are scared that more rules might be enacted or investigations into gray areas might be troublesome. But those are exactly the areas that need, frankly, actual adults trained and experienced in these matters rather than totally stressed out 18-19 year olds being crammed full of science, many of whom were socially awkward before and even during college.",

Quotes by undergrads were taken out of context and twisted around until they no longer resembled their original meanings.\n\nI understand that the House system isn't for everyone, but we the students, working with admin, had already decided Bechtel should be for those people. I think most of us are fine with frosh opting out of rotation and into Bechtel, as long as rotation itself continues.\n\nSo if you still haven't figured out who this fails: the Houses in general, which most students like, and financially disadvantaged students in particular.",

It\u2019s expensive, like all Caltech housing, relative to other housing in the area. It requires board (although to Caltech\u2019s credit, they are doing a good job increasing the variety of board plans. They are still expensive though.) And it only has 4 kitchens, if I\u2019m remembering right, between the 250 people. That\u2019s amazingly overcrowded.",

Comments collected were purely to do with the decision of how to allocate spaces in Bechtel (something which, by and large, the student population is satisfied with) but were used in a way that made it seem the reforms to rotation were approved by students.  In actuality, students were given no warning that these changes were occurring, and found out immediately before midterms and halfway through House elections, meaning half of the IHC was brand new and the other half wouldn't be around for long.  In addition, claims were made that the IHC was unwilling to work on reforming the rotation system, when in fact it underwent an overhaul not long ago.  The current procedure has been recently posted by the IHC to their website [here.](http://ihc.caltech.edu/)",

It provided me a sense of belonging when the rigors of Tech and stereotypes of my gender told me I didn\u2019t.\n\nBut I found a good fit.  Not everyone did.  I witnessed others struggle when both the academics and the clique house system made them feel like outsiders. \n\nAnd then there were people like you.  (And I do mean you specifically.  I lived in Ruddock in the same period.). You seemed to transcend the house system in a way that I had trouble with.  You seemed to make and keep friends easily.  I needed a \u2018friend starter kit\u2019.\n\nI get why people are up in arms.  On a gut level, the houses were family.  This change fundamentally changes the housing system in a way that is unknown.  However, don\u2019t think it will be the downfall of Tech.  Rice has a similar housing system that has served them well.\n\nThanks for being an upstanding upperclassman when I was a freshman.  Your friendships across houses was a reminder that the us-vs-them mentality wasn\u2019t necessary.  It reminded me that a sense of belonging didn\u2019t require an equal and opposite sense of exclusion for others.",

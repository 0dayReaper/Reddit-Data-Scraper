            "comment": "I know this is kind of a throwaway answer, but it depends a lot on what kind of person you are and what kind of work it is. Some of the work is the kind where you can sit down and grind it out in a reasonable amount of time. The time spent studying will correlate with how efficiently you can pick up on new concepts and translate them into a set. However, some of the work at Caltech is the kind that you could spend 18 somewhat painful hours bashing your head into by yourself until you finish it, or you could find a small group working on the same thing as you (which is pretty easy to do for the most part), and finish in maybe 5 or 6 hours.\n\nIf you put too much pressure on yourself to do everything you possibly can and work by yourself until you understand everything perfectly, then yes, you might have to study for 18+ hours a day. If you let go of some of that pressure and work with those around you, then life will be a good bit easier. \n\nNote that this isn't to say that you'll only ever have 8 hour workdays and can spend every weekend partying if you play your cards right, Caltech is still an extremely challenging school, but your level of stress will depend mostly on how much you're willing to work with others. \n\nYou will almost certainly run into a few 18 hour workdays, due to getting swamped by something else or extension trapping yourself, but they're the exception, not the rule.",

            "comment": "u/nowis3000 gives a really good answer above, but just to add my numerical anecdote:\nIt's more useful to think about hours per week than per day (since that's how sets are typically doled out). As a senior in a hard major, I've definitely had terms that were 70+ hours of work per week when united at ~50, but I've also had 50 unit terms that are more like 30-40 hours per week of work. You can count on a couple of 18+ hour days happening in your time (around midterms, finals, or projects/activities/events), but it's not like that every day, and most of the time you can find ways to do that work more quickly/ more efficiently.",

I'm wondering if anyone can share how these interviews go and how to best prepare. Would also be nice if anyone in or familiar with the program could talk about the whole PhD experience at Caltech! I'm an international student btw\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Caltech is a great research institution but there are two downsides:\n1. There teaching sucks. Especially if you are grad student, try not to waste time in their classes. The professors are rambling on through every lecture. The TAs are often lazy and simply don\u2019t care.\n2. It is a very lonely place. You are pretty much by yourself always. It would be so much better if you bring a partner here. Otherwise it is so hard, especially if you are male. If you are a man, I suggest you either come in with a girlfriend, or make sure you are ok with being extremely lonely.",

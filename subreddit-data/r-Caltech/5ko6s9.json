And how how challenging is it?\n\nWould you recommend coming to Caltech for electrical engineering?\n\nThank you, and if you're a Caltech student or graduate, props to you for reaching such an amazing school.",

Copying a bit too closely for homework is treated the same as cheating on a final. Most take home exams are open book/open note and nothing on the internet is going to help you.\n\n3. 3.8 unweighted. I was on the low end.\n\n4. ME. \"Easy\" for other people, but I'm kinda a dum dum.\n\n5. EE is an amazing program here. It is probably one of the more challenging ones in terms of sheer hours (most of them spent spring break working on finals) and the way the courses are laid out.",

And I'm in two weird situations; I'm taking my AP Calc BC, AP chem, and AP phys 2 in my senior year, will that make my application look weaker because i submit it before i take the AP tests for these important subjects? \n\nI have a semi-good GPA, the reason is because all the mathematics, sciences, and english i get As in, but stupid classes like Spanish and History are bringing my GPA down. Will admissions care about all the unimportant classes like that? (I am in the top ~5% of my math classes and top of sciences).\n\nThanks.",

Unfortunately, my school still made me take them....  (So I just walked in, jammed through them, and walked out without bothering to check my work - good mind fuck on your classmates!)\n\nAdmissions looks at the \"whole student\" - so Spanish and History bringing down your GPA probably won't *really* affect your chances.\n\nThink about this for a second, though - this is one of the premier science and engineering schools in the world.  The vast majority of your peers applying for Tech *probably* are taking their AP classes as well, if not full on college classes in those areas.  What makes *you* special?  (There's got to be something that separates you)\n\nI also say majority, as there were a few students who hadn't taken calculus by the time they got to Tech.  So they got places in \"Math .5\" instead of Math 1a.",

The placement exams don't matter because they are administered after you're accepted. A few people get to skip classes (but still don't get credit for AP tests), and a few people have to take remedial classes (no credit). When I was there, they were talking about implementing a Math 0 optional summer school online course for all freshman to get them accustomed to proof writing  (Math 1a).\n\nYou will not be able to count your AP scores for anything. Most people at Tech would have entered their local state school the credit equivalent of juniors due to AP classes, but here, you have to take everything again. It's very difficult to transfer credits from another college or CC because Tech wants to make sure your GPA reflects the difficult curriculum all students have to take (I'm mostly referring to core math and physics. You're not getting out of that).\n\nBack to your original question, it shouldn't be a problem that you get your scores after you've applied because I'm sure the admissions office has some way to account for that. You may not slack off on the tests though.",

Having said that: homework is given out with the idea being that you are going to collaborate with your classmates.  (Read: HARD)  Exams are usually open-note/open-book with a finite time limit.  In general, you will be asked to use the basis of the knowledge you gained in the class to formulate new (to you) ideas along certain lines.  This is not a place for students to regurgitate what's in a book - this is for students that want to push the boundaries of human knowledge.  (Or be the ones that can help fill the gap between normal people and those pushing the boundaries) :)\n\n3. I had A's and B's.  With weighted GPA, I was at 4.2 - barely out of the top 10% of my school, but my class was ridiculous.  (For context, my GPA graduating from Tech was 2.4.  D is for Diploma!)\n\n4. I got a EE.  It was rather challenging.  Homework sets took our group of four all night.  Like: start the set at 8 and finish at around 8.  Frosh would go to sleep, wake up, and say \"Hey!  You guys are in the same place as when I went to sleep!\"  (Thanks, frosh)  This is every night M-F, mind you.  We would sometimes have homework sets where NO undergrad knew what to do.  (We'd roam from house to house and get the same \"wtf\" looks from the other groups)\n\n5.  Maybe?  I'm certain there are other EE schools that are as good as or better than Tech, and my degree is 20 years old, and in all honesty I didn't pursue EE as a career.  Something like \"Caltech sucked the love of science out of me\"...  Like all things in life, you get out of it what you put into it.  There's *AMAZING* potential at Tech - small size, amazing research, painful studying.  It may or may not be for you.\n\nBest of luck!\n",

From what I've seen, I would say compared to students at MIT and Stanford, students at Caltech are a little less competitive, a little less concerned with their GPAs, and a little more dedicated to the purity of learning. (Note: this is not a strictly positive thing.)\n\n3. 4.0 weighted. I was in the top 5% of my high-school class but I had terrible grades compared to other admitted students. At least three of my close friends at Caltech were high-school valedictorians. My standardized-test scores were in the &gt;=99th percentile, which I believe was critical for me getting in (in addition to research experience, extracurriculars, etc.).\n\n4. Computer science. It's supposed to be one of the easier majors, but some of the classes are known to be difficult. Namely, CS 21 (computability theory), CS 38 (algorithms), and CS 24 (systems). Personally, I've struggled with the theory-oriented classes while the programming classes have been more straightforward...but your experience may vary.\n\n5. Only if you're up for a challenge. Electrical engineering is the most work-intensive major at Caltech, and a few of the required classes are notorious for asking too much of their students. Be prepared to learn a lot of things on your own, and be prepared to spend a lot of time in the Moore subbasement.",

            "comment": "1. Caltech is great as a science school. Engineering I've heard from my engineering friends that there is too much (?) focus on the theory and science behind the engineering and not enough emphasis on the practical aspects of designing / engineering a thing.\n\n2. You can cheat but it is usually obvious when you do. There is a system for dealing with academic violations.\n\n3. I did pretty well in high school, 3.8 or so (but this is low)* edit - 3.8 unweighted, 4.5ish weighted - I  don't exactly remember; I probably got in to Caltech because my high school had a great science program, I did science fairs and did pretty dang well in them, and also shadowed / did a little bit of work in a few labs during high school. Outside-of-school opportunities can bolster your application when your grades are not perfect.\n\n4. I majored in chemistry (I graduated in 2015). Chemistry is not the hardest major at Caltech but it is really as hard as you make it. I got involved in some serious lab research middle of my freshman year and continued through the end of my senior year, and got a few papers out of it! But it's really what you make of it.\n\n5. I would recommend other schools for engineering, but Caltech EE is a very top-notch program. A Caltech degree does count for a lot in terms of name-brand. People recognize that Caltech students are taught to think. However, you may not have as much practical experience as other schools unless you take initiative.",

            "comment": "I graduated from Caltech in 2003.\n\n\n1. Science. Caltech tends to be theory-heavy.\n\n\n2. Like everyone else has said, there is social pressure to not cheat. \n\n3. My weighted GPA was 5.3. I'm not sure what my unweighted GPA was -- I might have had one A- and maybe one B+. (My lowest grades might have been in math, which is ironic considering that I went to Caltech.) I had 5's on all the AP exams I took, near perfect SAT I scores, and very good SAT II scores. The AP courses I took were Bio, Chem, Physics B, Physics C: Mechanics, Physics C: E&amp;M (I think AP Physics has changed since I took it), Calculus AB, Calculus BC, English Language, English Literature, French Language, Economics (Micro and Macro), and Computer Science A.\n\n\n4. I majored in Engineering and Applied Sciences (E&amp;AS). I was going for computer science, but at the time, Caltech did not have a CS major. CS was a concentration within E&amp;AS. Although I took mostly CS courses, I did not complete all the courses required for the concentration, which would have appeared on my transcript but not on my diploma. E&amp;AS was probably easier than most other majors because its requirements were more flexible. Overall, though, I would say Caltech was very challenging  for me, and would have been no matter what my major.\n\n\n5. The benefits of Caltech include research opportunities and name recognition. Employers and other universities know that if you graduated from Caltech, you're probably hard-working and smart. On the other hand, because it's so small, there are also people who confuse Caltech with Cal Poly or a community college. I don't know how Caltech's EE is ranked, but it does have the reputation of being one of the hardest majors. \n\nPersonally, I don't think Caltech was a great choice for me. I could have and probably should have gone to other universities that were better ranked in computer science and had more diversity in non-science courses. I also regret not going to a school that would have given credit for my AP scores.",

    "postText": "Hi! I was recently accepted into Caltech's SURF program for the summer, and because I'm a visiting student, they're not currently offering on-campus housing for me (I think due to covid restrictions). \n\nDoes anyone know of any resources with which to find people to sublet for the summer in the Caltech area and/or is anyone on this subreddit looking to sublet?\n\nI'm having trouble finding places otherwise since I live across the country, so I'd need somewhere furnished and only for a 10 week period, which is difficult to find when looking at apartments that want to lease for the entire year. \n\nThanks for any help!\n\nEDIT\n\nI'm all set for housing now that it's been determined I am able to work on campus! I found a place to live here: https://www.places4students.com/Places/School?SchoolID=42JGUtTc5Rc%3D\n\nI highly recommend checking it out if you're looking for somewhere to live as well near Caltech; it does look a little sketchy at first, so just make sure you contact the landlord of the property and get a few different angles of the same room or feature to make sure its legit haha\n\nBest of luck to everyone, and thanks especially to u/Stewood2323 who suggested Places 4 Students !",

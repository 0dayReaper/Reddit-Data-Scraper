I can't believe the Dabney and Ricketts stereotypes have persisted this long.  It's surprising and yet comforting.",

Is Page still like that or am I just reading into things?\n\nAlso, does anyone here remember [Crippling Depression](http://cripplingdepression.com/)? I'm dating myself, but I read it while I was in senior year of high school and considering Tech.",

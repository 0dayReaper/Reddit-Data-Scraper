Through this operation, the Institute is in regular communication with the Pasadena Public Health Department (PPHD).\n* The instructional term ended Wednesday, March 11. Undergraduate students will complete their final exams and assignments for the quarter remotely and have been strongly encouraged to return home for the duration of spring break.\n* A transition to remote learning will begin effective the first day of spring term, Monday, March 30.\n* The Institute has offered guidance on non-essential domestic travel and has implemented international travel restrictions.\n* Caltech is canceling all campus and off-campus events through June 12, the end of spring quarter, with the possible exception of commencement exercises. We hope that conditions may improve in time to hold our 126th Commencement ceremony, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. on June 12. We will provide updates on plans for commencement as the date approaches.\n* All spring intercollegiate athletic contests and practices will be canceled as of March 15. This action is taken in concert with our Division 3 conference, the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) which has canceled all conference competition for the spring.\n* Caltech custodial staff have introduced enhanced cleaning measures, which includes using EPA-recommended antimicrobial products on high-traffic surfaces, such as elevator buttons and doorknobs, three times per day\n* The Children's Center at Caltech (CCC) will be closed Tuesday March 17 through Friday, March 27. The CCC announcement can be found [here](https://www.caltech.edu/documents/47/CCC_closure_Covid19.pdf).",

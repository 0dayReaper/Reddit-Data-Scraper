    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI'm a second-year physics undergrad at Oxford and am planning to apply to Caltech's SURF program for 2023. The chance to spend a summer working with incredibly talented researchers in one of the best institutes in the world is something that I want to try not to miss. Since I'm new to this and have never applied to similar programs before, I was looking for advice- whether my experiences are good enough, how to maximise my chances of getting in, how to get a mentor to reply to your email, etc. If you have done a SURF program visiting from the UK, it would be great to speak to you!",

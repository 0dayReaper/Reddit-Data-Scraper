    "postText": "I was recently accepted to the Caltech applied physics Phd program (very excited!) and I have a whole slew of question about grad student life. These are all pretty generally, so any insight is super helpful!\n\n1. Do people seem happy? Do they generally like the research environment? How about the community? \n2. What are the pros and cons of the smallness? Does the community feel more connected? Does it feel limiting? (I'm used to a large school). \n3. Does Caltech take good care of their grad students? Is the healthcare good? Do most grad students want to live in campus housing, and are they able to? Is there a union? \n4. Is the school pretty social? Do people make a lot of friends outside their department? Do most students mostly engage with the school community, or are they more integrated with Pasadena? Does the \\~2:1 grad student gender ratio affect dating? \n5. Anything else you like / don't like, or that a prospective grad student should know? Anyone know anything about APh / physical science specifically? \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Current grad student (different program) so I\u2019ll throw in my 2 cents. \n1) I\u2019m happy here, but like most things ymmv. There\u2019s obviously high value placed on scientific research and high achievement in general, but I think your personal experience will really depend on your program and advisor. \n2) Pros of the smallness: very little bureaucracy, very easy to collaborate across labs or even divisions, I would say there\u2019s an overall strong sense of community. Cons of the smallness: sometimes it feels like you live in a bubble and you can never just get a coffee on campus without running into someone you know. I also came from a big school and it took a little getting used to, but I actually like the smallness for grad school (probably wouldn\u2019t have liked it as much for UG). \n3) There is pretty limited housing for grad students. You are guaranteed housing your first year but after that space is assigned based on a lottery. I think a group is currently trying to organize a union but afaik, a grad student union doesn\u2019t exist yet (don\u2019t quote me on that though). Healthcare coverage is decent but it\u2019s gonna cost you. Not sure how it compares to other grad programs though. \n4) I would say the grad student culture is pretty social. For as small as we are, there are quite a few clubs and other organized groups. I would say most people\u2019s closest friends are generally in their divisions or labs, but plenty of people (including myself) have friends outside their division. Since we\u2019re in the LA metro, I also know people who have friends/family in the area (but I mostly just hang with people at Caltech). \n5) Your program is pretty different than mine so I can\u2019t speak to it at all, but I\u2019ll just say that I love it here and even though it definitely isn\u2019t perfect, I\u2019m really glad that I\u2019m getting my PhD here",

            "comment": "Current PhD student in Physics here, with many friends in applied physics, so I think I can offer some insight.\n\n1. Generally, yes - people are pretty happy. There's the typical stresses and overworking that you see in grad school (especially since Caltech students by nature tend to be the overachieving/workaholic type), but being set in SoCal there's \\*many\\* opportunities/ways to bring balance to your life. One of the world's largest cities is right nearby, as is the beach, mountains, and deserts.  Whatever you want to do, you can find it here or nearby. That helps a lot.\n2. It definitely feels a lot more intimate. I came from a large school as well, and I found it pleasantly surprising to run into people on campus that I had chatted to at a random event the week prior (something that would \\*never\\* happen during undergrad - the campus was simply too big!) I really haven't found the smallness to be that limiting - save for maybe finding people who like the same sports (e.g. American football) that I do. On that note, if you like attending school sports events, then the smallness is going to be a big bummer for you. Another perk of the smallness is the lack of bureaucratic \"red tape\" to dance through; if you need something done from the registrar, or from your department administration, you can usually just reach out to them directly and they'll get it done right away. This was a \\*massive\\* difference from my undergrad at a big state school.\n3. Pre-pandemic, I felt like they did take good care of us. The pay is more than liveable, and the administration reviews/raises it every other year (I think?) to keep up with inflation. There's a good deal of Caltech housing available, both on campus and subsidized off-campus, which helps students save on rent quite a bit. They put on quite a few events for us (both campus-wide, through grad reslife, through the Caltech Y, and Y) that were really nice, and they offered lots of other helpful programs for everything ranging from mental health to personal finance. Since the pandemic, things have been much harder; the events have been limited almost exclusively to virtual events, and the administration has been rather Draconian when it's come to imposing restrictions on the grad students (especially in the residential communities). Part of this was the Grad Student Council (GSC)'s COVID response team demanding more accountability from the Institute and them going too far in response, part of this is fear of liability and restrictions from local health departments, and part (I'm sure) is just the utter lack of precedence for the last 11 months. Overall though, I felt happy with their care of us before COVID. I haven't used the Caltech healthcare yet, but my impression of it is that it's far from the best. As for housing, all incoming first years are entitled to on-campus housing in the graduate apartments, and most first years take this offer. The apartments are pretty decent (though this does vary quite a bit from apartment to apartment), the rent is cheap, and there's a nice sense of community knowing you live a minute's walk from your friends. Unfortunately, the housing office can be a pain in the ass to deal with, and loves to try and fine students over every little thing. That said, it's still a good option for the first year or two. As far as I know, there's no grad student union.\n4. The stereotype of Caltech being a bunch of nerds is not unearned, but in my experience there is still plenty of social interaction - especially in applied physics (the department where most of my friends here actually are in). The student body here tends to be really into outdoor activities (hiking, climbing, biking, skiing, surfing, etc), so this is a great way to meet people here.  The orientation events are also a pretty good way to meet other students - especially the international students orientation. In general, try to find clubs or groups with shared interests, and sign up for the reslife and Caltech Y events! I'd say the grad students tend to interact more amongst themselves than with Pasadena - Pasadena is a pretty quiet community, and seems to have a lot of older residents. Again though, you'll be able to find people to connect with if you know where to look. As for the gender ratio, the mere fact its 2:1 does pose some challenges with respect to dating - and in applied physics, it's worse (I'm guessing based on your question that you're interested in women - if not, then I'm afraid I don't have much advice). That said, I met my girlfriend here (who, incidentally, came in as applied physics) and I know of a few other couples among my cohort, so it's certainly possible.\n5. I've been extremely happy with my choice to come here - the research is top-tier, the other students have been pleasant, and there is \\*so much\\* to do outside of work here! Specific to Applied physics, the course load is pretty brutal - there are lots of courses to take, and the courses themselves can be a drag (the profs cover material at warp speed and leave you to sift through the details they should have taught you on the problem sets). That said, the courseload means you get to know the students in your cohort very well. Also, this past year they have started loosening up with letting students out of course requirements if they come in with a masters or equivalent coursework. Most of the applied physics students tend to come in already knowing who they will work for, and start working with them right away - but don't fret if you're not in that position - you'll be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, there's my thoughts - bit of a disorganized mess, but I hope it proves helpful to you. Let me know if you have further questions.\n\nLastly, congrats on getting in - that's an accomplishment in its own right!",

            "comment": "Hi! Current first year grad student here. I have several friends in the applied physics program, and I have to say, they all seem to be doing mindblowingly cool stuff. \n\n1. Hopefully anyone you talk to will tell you this, but choosing an advisor who agrees with your approach to research time/work time expectations is critical. Choose the advisor over the program for any grad program you are considering. I have a great advisor, so although the workload is heavy, I consider myself happy. \n2. I thought the smallness would be a downside. *The case is absolutely the opposite.* The small class sizes are critical for being engaged in courses, especially over zoom. I took grad courses in undergrad that had 100+ people, and I never spoke to the professor individually. In all six courses I've taken so far, all my professors know who I am. I feel that it increases interdisciplinary thought too because talks in different departments are not overwhelmed with attendees. I'm not in physics, but I have (virtually) attended several physics talks. Seriously, the smallness is a huge pro for me. \n3. I live in campus housing, and the pricing is reasonable. It's not \\*great\\* housing, but I just got out of college and am still excited about the novelty of living in my own apartment (with housemates), so I don't mind at all. I can't speak much to the healthcare plan, but I know some people think it's good and some people think it's bad. I would definitely read the fine print on those if you think this is a very important factor for you. \n4. It's hard to tell how social Caltech is since I've only been virtual so far. That said, I have made several friends. I'm a woman, so I can't speak to the gender ratio negatively affecting dating for cis men. That said, it's LA. There's UCLA, JPL, USC, and plenty of other places where you could meet young single people. \n5. If you like outdoor stuff, Pasadena is incredible. When I came for my interview in person, I had never been to LA, and I was shocked that there were mountains five miles from Caltech.",

Are there any plans to build more housing? \n\nCutting healthcare and stifling student advocacy are much more concerning. Do you seriously think they would retaliate against students who tried to organize? I'm wondering if I as an incoming student would get caught in worsening conditions with little I can do about it.

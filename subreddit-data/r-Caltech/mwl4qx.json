    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm trying to choose between UC Berkeley M.E.T. (a dual-degree program providing bachelor's degrees in EECS from the School of Engineering and Business Administration from HAAS) and Caltech (CS or CNS).\n\nCost-wise, Caltech is around 10k cheaper than MET. However, right now I'm trying to evaluate the merits of each school versus another, so feel free to disregard it in your recommendations.\n\nSome things about me:\n\n* I have a strong technical tilt but would eventually like to move into management roles (open to but not necessarily in a rush to do so right now, however).\n* I'm most interested in going into Machine Learning/AI, and especially those fields applied towards Medicine or Neuroscience. From what I understand, however, those fields typically require holding masters/PhD degrees to get recruited for.\n* Planning to do Masters at a minimum. Potentially might consider PhD.\n* Ideally, I want to the industry as soon as possible. However, if PhD is necessary to enter ML/AI roles, I'm open to that as well.\n* Research is fairly important to me as well as from what I understand, it's essential for entering a good grad school. UCB has BAIR, which is really impressive. However, I am unsure how easy it would be to enter it. Caltech, on the other hand, is overall, a research powerhouse. That being said, I do not want to go into academia in the future.\n\nSome pros that I currently associate with MET are:\n\n* Guaranteed internships at Skydeck/Y-Comb Startups with 2k/month stipend.\n* Great internship recruitment pipelines. The number of companies far outnumber the students. Access to FAANG seems high, which is valuable to me. Mr. Grimes seems pretty helpful thus far, and I've heard he helps a lot in recruitment.\n* Top ranked Engineering (EECS is tied for 2nd in the US) + Business School (HAAS is 3rd in the US)\n* Lots of AP/CC Credits Accepted. I could potentially graduate in 3 years or pursue a 4+1 master's program, coming out with 3 degrees in 4 years.\n\nSome cons that I currently associate with MET:\n\n* Doing research would mean pulling away from internships/industry, which MET seems to specialize in. Also unsure about the realisticness of entering BAIR.\n* For companies that don't recognize the MET brand, Caltech might hold a stronger name.\n* MET alumni network is still small (the first graduating class is 2021)\n\nSome pros of Caltech:\n\n* Research opportunities seem to be unparalleled. I feel these will help when applying to Grad School.\n* Caltech has SURF', which is a summer research program with \\~85% acceptance rate. Fellows receive $6,600 for the 10-week research period.\n* Caltech's brand seems to be universally recognized. Don't have the catch of only being recognized at few companies like MET.\n* Caltech students are also scarcer than Berkeley in general. For companies that don't recognize MET, Caltech might stick out more than Berkeley.\n* Caltech does have a BEM (Business Economics &amp; Management), which will let me dive into the finance and quant parts from MET's Business Admin degree. Definitely not a full business administration degree but hits at parts that I'm\n\nSome cons of Caltech:\n\n* Doesn't have much of an industry focus, so venturing into that domain would be more difficult.\n* Caltech BEM isn't anywhere close to being as well recognized as HAAS.\n* I'm worried I might be funneled into more academia-related roles.\n\nAny advice on either of the options would be really appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!",

            "comment": "I am a Berkeley undergrad coming to caltech for a phd. \n\nI think you might be over planning. Both have great name recognition. Both are research powerhouses. Berkeley probably has more real business opportunities at least at the school. And the culture difference between Berkeley MET and caltech (CS?) is probably pretty different, in terms of MET being more business / entrepreneurship focused. But you could probably do either from either. Caltech probably does more to help you find a research position, but in my experience people who want to do research at Berkeley almost always can. If you are very set on a particular field (eg ML) then caltech may be a better bet. \n\nOthers can probably elaborate better on all of these things.\n\nHere is what I think I can add: this is a long and elaborate plan, but you're just entering college and plans and interests change. You seem very eager to get on with things after college, but remember to think about your college experience itself. Going to a school that will facilitate growth and exploration is probably more important than any of the differences listed above. I really can't tell you which school will facilitate more growth, but Berkeley certainly has a greater diversity of people and perspectives. You'll find people with master plans about going into elite academia or FAANG companies, and people smoking weed on the glade. Many of them are the same people, and many start out in one camp and switch to the other. I think relaxing a bit, focusing on the present, and exploring your interests and passions is really important, and you should remember that whichever school you choose. \n\nThen, there's the question of where you would be happier. Both are great schools and communities. Caltech has a residential living / dining situation in a way that Berkeley doesn't (at least for most students after the first year). This can be a nice community. Berkeley probably has a wider breadth of perspectives than caltech... you're more likely to find people who care about the same things you do, whatever that ends up being. Both are in nice areas, I think Berkeley is a nicer city than Pasadena. Both have lots of clubs, but I get the impression the smaller size of caltech lowers the barrier and more of the students get involved. Not sure about this though. In any case, you can't grind your way through 4 years of college just to get on to the next thing. You'll be more successful when you're happier and following your interests. \n\nI don't mean any of this in a \"chill out\" or \"don't be ambitious\" sense. I mean it more in a \"know thyself\" sense. Especially when you're in college, \"thyself\" is changing, so in order to know thyself you need to be able to explore and grow. Just keep all of that in mind :). \n\nBest wishes!",

I definitely agree with the \"know thyself\" theme. However, since I value both research, I'm just having trouble figuring out which parts I like more. I'll probably try to give a weight to each and think upon this more. I had follow up questions regarding some points that you raised.\n\n* You mentioned students who want to do research at Berkeley can almost always. Do you think these students' primary focus tends to be research or are they usually able to balance research with internships and clubs?\n* Are there certain reasons why you say that Caltech might be better if we're interested in particular fields?",

            "comment": "I did my undergrad at Cal (IEOR) finishing a PhD at Caltech (CMS).\n\nName recognition for MET is a non-issue. Berkeley EECS and Haas have the name recognition to carry you wherever you want to go in industry. That said, I think Caltech undergrads have the highest turnover to PhD\u2019s (and in top programs) than any other undergrad program in the US. In general you\u2019re correct that Caltech grads are more \u201cuniformly\u201d eye-catching from recruiters\u2019 standpoints.\n\nBAIR is insanely competitive. I mean, if you got into Caltech then you can probably get into BAIR if you tried, but it\u2019s no guarantee. You need multiple A+\u2019s in notoriously hard classes at a school that is known for \u201cgrade deflation\u201d relative to peer institutions. Personally I never got involved in research at Berkeley so I don\u2019t have first-hand knowledge though. (For context, my undergrad career was very unusual, and I feel that my getting into Caltech and succeeding here has involved more than a few strokes of good luck).\n\nYou are definitely right that research (and good research) is more of a sure thing at Caltech. My advisors just hired two SURFs for summer project I proposed.\n\nI think the breadth of opportunities will be wider at Berkeley. There\u2019s just so much going on in the SF Bay.\n\nReal takeaway here is that you can\u2019t go wrong from a professional or an intellectual standpoint. You should ask about the culture among the undergrads. Who are the people you\u2019ll be working with side-by-side during a four-year trial by fire?",

I think if I get into it, research opportunities there in ML/AI are just as good, if not better, than Caltech. The only issue is that the edge of MET is its industry connections and recruitment pipelines. I've heard to get into BAIR, you need to have 3.9+ GPA in tech classes and that the only thing those students do is research. I don't want to fully commit myself to research yet. Fully agree with the breadth of opportunities at UCB and the city itself. Love the culture there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have a follow-up question for you: \n\n* Since you didn't do research at Cal but still ended up at a very top-notch PhD program like Caltech, I was curious if research is not necessarily a requirement for grad school. I've been brought up to believe that it was, but I may be wrong.\n\nThanks again!",

That went very well and my mentor at the time (well known in the field) wrote me a strong letter of rec. I also took lots of grad classes. I was the only undergrad in my department to take some of these classes in a few years so that made me memorable and led to other good letters of rec. I was also able to put together a good narrative for my \"intellectual journey\" when I applied to Caltech's CMS program.\n\nMy takeaway is that you need a minimum amount of research to be considered for top grad programs. From there, there are several paths to acceptance. One path is to have all-star faculty write you good letters of rec (either because you did a small amount of research with them or you took their grad classes). Another path is to go all-in on research and have 2+ good publications by the time you apply to grad school. Another path is to apply to newer interdisciplinary programs with an academic record that materially proves your interdisciplinary interests (and ability).",

            "comment": "The impression I get from this post is that you're thinking of education as a financial arrangement: you trade $X and Y hours of work now for easier access to employment opportunity Z tomorrow. That probably sounds like an accusation, but I don't mean it that way: the undercurrent in academic culture that says pursuing \"the life of the mind\" makes you better and smarter than people in industry is no different from the sort of empty status-seeking you see in /r/cscareerquestions. You're a lot wiser than I was at 18 if you've seen through it. \n\nBut it's the wrong attitude for Caltech. Yes, Tech is very prestigious. Yes, you will come out the other end with marketable skills and a resume that turns heads long enough to give you a chance to demonstrate them. But that resume will reflect about 10% of the work you put in. The only real evidence of the other 90% will exist entirely in your head. \n\nYou've probably gotten variations on this speech dozens of times: Tech is hard, you have to drink from a firehose, it's not like other schools. Take them seriously. If this sounds unspeakably awful, then go somewhere else. Obviously. I heard all the same cliches as a prefrosh: I thought they sounded *great*. And it was. But there were a lot of people for whom life at Tech was not great. For me, \"drinking from a firehose\" was like setting an alarm: I *want* to wake up in the morning, and if a few seconds of stress are what it takes to keep my sleep brain in line, then so be it. For other people, it was more like having a fire alarm go off five nights in a row: it's profoundly unpleasant, and accomplishes nothing, and now if there's ever a real fire, half the hovse is just going to assume the frosh put a phone in the microwave again and go back to sleep. \n\nMore concretely: if you could enjoy the exact same level of professional success (whatever that means for you) without going to college - would you? If so, you absolutely should not go to Caltech.",

            "comment": "What kind of jobs do you want to look for? In general, I'd advise against majoring in CE because you'll limit your options over EE or CS.  EE is the 2nd hardest major at Tech so IIRC, not many of them double major. Tech introduced a CS minor which should be pretty easy to achieve. \n\nEven if you limit your choices to schools that offer EECS, you'll still end up concentrating in EE or CS. Think about what you want to do long term and work backwards. Don't major in CE, it's a bad idea.",

Additionally, I am pretty split between software and hardware, so I wanted a major where I can be very knowledgeable in both with enough effort.",

Who knows what they'll be doing in 4-5 years when you're applying there. I believe Intel moved most of their commerical operations abroad. If any activity is left in CA, it would be high level development (PhD in physics/matsci). I don't know anyone in my generation who has worked there. Anyone I do know worked there around 20 years ago, so I'd look critically at the current state of the company, especially if you're skilled and ambitious enough to consider Caltech.\n\nStill don't major in CE. You're going to need a PhD to be a research engineer and you'll have a much easier time applying to grad school as EE or CS and looking at labs that focus on quantum computing or semiconductor fab. \n\nI'd say apply as EE because it'll be easier to go from EE to CS than vice versa. No matter what path you end up on, you might learn that you love smaller startups, or other industries or academia, so definitely take the time to accept opportunities as they come. \n\nDefinitely don't major in CE. It's like majoring in industrial engineering vs mechanical engineering.",

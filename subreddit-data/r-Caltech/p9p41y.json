I'm assuming not but there's an article that I want to read that I currently can't find non-paywalled so I figured I'd see if anyone knows.\n\n(I did email the author to see if she's allowed to share it directly with me, and waiting on a response, but I just thought of this too so figured I'd ask here as well!)",

    "postText": "How\u2019s it like being in a very small university? My HS for example has 3,800+ students with between 850-950 students in the 12th (my grade) and 11th grade classes and 1,000+ students in the 9th and 10th grade classes, so Caltech having ~1,000 undergraduates and ~250 students per class is a massive difference. How is it like, for students at Caltech, being at a university with a very small undergraduate (and graduate) population?\n\nEdit: Ayyy, I have over 10 likes!",

I think Caltech's small size is pretty great.\n\nThen take the opposite of all these statements to get the downsides of Caltech's small size.",

Personally, the size of Caltech is one of the best parts of Caltech for me. Your not just another person in a sea of others but you have a chance to get meaningful interactions with other students and professors (I think the house system also is really great too for helping create these connections and all), but so far I really haven't felt like i missed out by not going to a larger university",

            "comment": "In my opinion it\u2019s probably the worst part of caltech. There are some pros, like tighter academic circles leading to closer interaction with peers and profs, and a broader sense of community, but it also makes the community as a whole feel more same-y, and the tighter academic circles means fewer classes actually running and a generally worse breadth of coursework than similar institutions that are much larger, especially in the humanities. Also, I think caltech has an issue with building strong communities that are unrelated to houses or something STEM/business. Also, the social circles are very tight and it can feel suffocating. One last thing, the small size affects student services a lot, especially dining, as we have very few dining options compared with a school 10 times our size. We also probably have fewer amenities and less access to them than your average larger school. Overall, it doesn\u2019t ruin caltech or anything, but it is certainly a big factor to consider.",

It was very, very hard for someone to get 'lost' -- you had to *work* to not end up with a core friend group. The house system + alley system helped with that too.\n\nWhen I compare my experience to that of a lot of my friends who went to Berkeley... several of them didn't really get a friend group going until a year in. They had people they *knew*, like their roommate and their floor and maybe one or two people from their smaller classes, but that's pretty different from having someone you (work on your homework with)+(eat dinner with)+(shoot the breeze at 1AM from a rooftop with).\n\nAs many Caltech students have lamented, though, a small community and even smaller houses means that there are no secrets. People at big state schools can talk about 'avoiding their ex' after a breakup. Such a concept is essentially impossible at Caltech, unless you're dating outside of your year, major, and house.",

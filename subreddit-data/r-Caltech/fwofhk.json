    "postText": "Hi guys! I was thinking about applying to Caltech mechanical engineering next year. However, I have read online from various fonts that the workload is huge, that social life is rare to have and that people barely sleep there. I think this is exaggerated but it is just my opinion. Is there any Caltech student (mech eng or any other) who could give his opinion on this?\n\nDo you guys enjoy it there?\n\nHow many hours do you study per week?\n\nWhat is a typical weekend like?\n\nThanks a lot :)",

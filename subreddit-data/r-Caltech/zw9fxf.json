    "postText": "intl + fin aid here, \n\nnow, I have 10-11 STEM oriented exams/awards, mostly national and few state level, finalist for india's IOAA team, wrote a book on HS Physics,  founded tech start up which is  currently getting pre sign-ups and stuff etc.\n\nMost parts of my application are suited for Caltech; however my school has this horrible grading system which is leading to grade DEFLATION!\n\nAll courses are regular, no acc/AP/IB, so no weighing GPAs either. although I'm in top 1-2% of class, my uw GPA is 92.15/100 which is roughly 3.72/4, junior year highest score was 90/100! \n\nGiven how competitive Caltech admission is, i wish to let AO's know of this, how can I do so without sounding as if I'm making excuses",

This guy showed up and said that my friend had to leave because he was by himself (which isn't a rule). He started to video with his phone and kept pestering for my friend's name, which he didn't give.\n\nFriend said to call the cops if he was so concerned, which the guy in the picture responded with continued requests for his name and said that he \"knew a lot of people and was a professor at Caltech.\" My friend just kept telling him to call the cops if he was so insistent about having the court. Then the coach on the other court got involved and told the professor guy to get off the court. The police did eventually arrive who informed your professor that no he did in fact not have the right to kick my friend off the court, and did not have the right to have my friend's name.\n\nWe believe that he thought my friend was a student at Caltech (he's not) and would have arm-twisted him using his \"professor powers\" to leave. All in all this guy sounds like a huge dick and I'm sorry you guys have to take his class.\n\nedits: grammar",

Given your friend is Asian I can definitely see race being a factor here. It reminds me a lot about the Karens and Kens going around harassing asian ppl in public spaces like [this incident in Davis](https://nextshark.com/davis-karen-ken-call-police-asian-man/). Even though a large portion of the undergraduate student body is asian (less so for graduate students) I think a lot of people here see picking on asians as something they can do without any consequence unlike with other protected classes; I feel admin has turned a blind eye to a lot of the concerns that asian students have been raising. I recall overhearing overtly racist things said by faculty and other students about asians, especially when Covid first hit (ranging on a scale from \"there's too many asians at this school\" to \"quarantine all the chinese\" to \"bat eating ch----\"). I grew up hearing a whole spectrum of slurs thrown at me while walking down the street, and even then, some of the shit I heard at Caltech still genuinely baffled me (mainly because these are people who should know better).\n\nTbh unless it's fall term (the only term Ch 1A is offered) and your friend is a freshman, or your friend is a chem major (pretty small portion of the class), there's not much real professor power Nate Lewis could conceivably wield. It's likely he just assumed he could take a chance, flaunt his \"prestige\" and push around an asian guy and that the police would naturally side with him. Props to your friend for standing his ground.",

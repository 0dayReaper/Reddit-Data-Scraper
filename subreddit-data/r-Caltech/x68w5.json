So like a 5 in the normal world would be a 7 at Caltech. And before college, these girls weren't used to glomming because it mainly happened to the attractive girls. So they get overwhelmed and/or take advantage of the situation.",

Especially at Caltech, these 5/10s as you would say are 7 to us because they match our attractions. It is not because we're desperate and pitiful nerds who would bang anything.",

The number of such men would quickly fall of as she made it clear which guys she might be interested in.\n\nMy close circles of friends included women, and when occasions arose when I wanted to do something with one of them alone (say, where we shared some common interest that our other friends did not), I never noticed any cloud of stalkers that I had to sneak them away from. It was not noticeably harder to find them alone and undisturbed than it was to find male friends alone and undisturbed.\n\nMaybe you only get glomming when the ratio is in a particular range. Too low, like it was when I was there, and guys know they don't have a realistic chance of getting a girlfriend, and so after they give it a shot at the start of the year and get rejected, they give up.\n\nWhen the ratio is high, the men are spread among enough girls so that no one is glommed, and if you get rejected by one girl you can try another.\n\nOnly when the ratio is high enough for guys to not give up, but low enough that each girl will have several interested guys, would there be glomming.\n\nIt would be interesting if someone could get good data on what years there was serious glomming (especially if there was ever that approached the kind of behavior described in the article), and compare to the ratio to see if there is indeed some kind of glomming spike at intermediate ratio values.",

I've never heard of guys following girls into showers, and I don't think they would have gotten away with it. I know girls who always seemed to be accompanied by several guys, but I believe it was by choice. \n\nI'm a girl who went to Caltech in the early 2000's, and I was never glommed. In fact, I did not get much male attention at all. ",

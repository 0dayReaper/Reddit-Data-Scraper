Of course everyone needs to put hours into doing the work, but was there anyone there who seemed to be able to understand the concepts and finish the work much faster than everyone else?\n\nBonus: if this person graduated, what are they doing now?",

            "comment": "There are always students that breeze through the pure sciences majors (Physics, Math, etc.) as they don't often require projects and lab assignments (which usually take some heavy commitments and are limited to some junior/senior lab).\n\nIn engineering though, it is often hard to be 'smart' because it becomes more of a race of initiative and time management that actual capability. There might be someone that has the drive to do everything all at once every once in a while, but it is actually quite rare.",

It also hasn\u2019t used the graduation honors like summa cum laude for a long time. They also got rid of the generic \u201cgraduation with honors\u201d moniker in 2018. Caltech has said that it prefers students to focus on research and learning than to try to get a perfect GPA. Also gpa comparisons between majors isn\u2019t super useful, and rewarding high gpas encourages students to not challenge themselves with tough courses.",

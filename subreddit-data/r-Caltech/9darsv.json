    "postText": "Hi I'm planning on applying for a SURF internship next summer. So I would like to ask for some advice.\n\nI'm a 3rd year undergrad (just finished second year) on a Maths and Physics course at a university in the UK. I'm currently doing a similar program to SURF at my own uni, with a particle physics professor, so I do have some relevant experience. I finish on the 7th. I've asked if he knows anybody at Caltech but he says he doesn't, but he suggested that one other professor might so I'll email him soon. \n\nI'm more interested in the theory side of particle physics so would prefer to work in the particle theory group but would be open to the experimental side too.\n\nThe particle group at my uni is relatively young but has a good reputation and has it's hands in pretty much all the major experiments going on around the world. My current supervisor is also fairly well known (I think but my only experience is at my own uni so that might bias me a bit) but he and the group are established enough that I think the Caltech professors will be aware of them.\n\nSo if anybody has experience applying to SURF from outside the US or even just from a uni outside of Caltech any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also any advice about SURF/the particle professors from someone at Caltech would be good too. I'm particularly interested in how to go about picking a supervisor and since Caltech doesn't provide funding how likely it is the professor will be willing to fund someone they've never met.\n\nThanks!",

However, I am curious about and have been unable to find an example of a freshman schedule. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be very appreciative if someone could post their schedule from freshman year, including class names and times, so that I can get a better idea of what that would look like. Thanks! ",

You also have a recitation section for an hour sometime during the week, these are at times between 9 and 3, you can choose which time you want. The CS classes are in the afternoon 2 or 3 days a week, some have a lab section for an hour a week. The hum classes are an hour and a half in the afternoons two days a week (usually Tuesday/Thursday), but there are also 7-10 pm once a week classes. \n\nDisclaimer, I didn't really go to classes that often, so my memory of times is a little fuzzy. \n\nNinja Edit: Also, join the prefrosh meme page",

            "comment": "Not really an answer, but: you don't have to worry too much about it, honestly. You'll get some emails over the summer about preferences of electives. The registrar will put you in classes, which is 90% the same for everyone. If you're very unhappy with what you get (either it's not what you wanted, or you learn something about classes that changes your mind), you have about a week between arriving and classes starting, to change your schedule around. And even after that, you have about a week where it's quite reasonable to be changing your schedule around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's for your first term. After that, you'll be surrounded by tons of upperclassmen in your House who can give you a lot more information, and can give much more specific advice based on your interests. So for your second/third terms freshman year, you'll have way more information to inform you signing up for classes.",

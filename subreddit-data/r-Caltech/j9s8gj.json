Hopefully this results in a rigorous courseload. The minute details of your schedule aren't going to matter as much as your STEM-related ECs anyway, I assume. Good luck.",

I started IB in August also wanting to go to Caltech and just took as many HLs as I can in hope of it paying off. Good luck with IB btw, the senior year workload is apparently insane.",

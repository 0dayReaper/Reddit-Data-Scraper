My main problem with Caltech was the heavy workload, which I found very difficult. I might have had trouble with MIT, too. Caltech students' social life is generally limited by the fact that they are always busy studying, often in groups.",

I'm not sure I can handle an insane workload because a lot of Caltech admits are used to 5+ AP classes at a time, while I have only had a max of 4 and I struggled a bit. \n\nAlso, I don't want to spend my life studying for four years. Are there any chances to get out to LA ever few weeks or so? Is there anything appealing in the direct area of caltech? \n\nThanks in advance if you take the time to answer. ",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm an incoming undergraduate summer researcher and was wondering whether anyone had some good advice on where I could try and find affordable housing near Caltech? I am starting a few weeks earlier than my cohort due to logistical conflicts and therefore won't be able to move onto campus until late June. I have looked at airbnb's but they have been 1k+ for 3 a week stay which is more than a month of rent in the state that I study. I also haven't been able to find any type of hostels or student geared short-term accommodation for the summer. I also have found it hard to find anyone that is subleasing in the area\n\nWould anyone have any advice?",

            "comment": "Never booked airbnbs near Pasadena but $1k for 3 weeks honestly sounds like a really good deal to me. For context, I've SURFed with Caltech for the past two years and have paid roughly $3k each year to live in on-campus housing for 10 weeks. Unfortunately real estate in California (ESPECIALLY Pasadena) is extremely expensive :( \n\nHave you tried reaching out to the program itself in regards to arranging some sort of alternate housing during those three weeks? They might be able to help (either find you a place or provide financial help?). I'm sorry to hear you're in this situation though",

I agree that 1k actually looks pretty good for the area it's just a lot of money for someone on a Pell Grant. Regardless I'm super stoked to spend a summer doing research at Caltech!",

    "postText": "Hi Techers,\n\nI'll be a new frosh next year and I had a few questions about taking notes in lectures or other classes. Do professors/TAs mind if you use a tablet (like an iPad) to take notes? Is it fairly common for students to do so? Please let me know as I'm considering getting one for next year. Also if you have any others tips I would really appreciate it!\n\nThanks! :)",

            "comment": "It's actually really common to use tablets for note taking (at least among the people I do sets with!). Most people I know have an iPad, but I know a few who have those laptop-tablet convertible things that seem pretty cool. For iPad, GoodNotes and Notability are the two note taking apps that are the most common (although I prefer GoodNotes).\n\nProfessors often upload their lecture slides before class, so what I usually do is download those slides into GoodNotes, and then take notes on each slide as we go. You also use a lot less paper doing sets on a tablet, and your sets turn out much neater. You just need to print them out from your house printer or the library to hand them in.\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to dm me if you have any other questions. Also welcome to Caltech!!",

I think both of them definitely have good features but I guess I'm just used to GoodNotes! Would definitely recommend reading about their features to get an idea of which you might prefer, but in the end they're very similar.",

However, it's not necessary to do well, lots of people use paper or LaTeX. I'd highly recommend learning LaTeX if you don't know it already, it'll come in handy for a lot of assignments. Personally I take notes with LaTeX since that's what I'm most comfortable using.",

My setup was common, and I also saw many students taking notes with Surfaces, convertibles, and even those Sony and reMarkable e-ink tablets.\n\n(Typing notes in LaTeX was also popular but I was too slow with LaTeX to do that myself.)\n\nGoodNotes and Notability for the iPad have been mentioned in this thread. I haven't used them, but I really liked OneNote for iPadOS. It makes it really easy to select, resize, and erase handwriting, and it syncs to your Caltech-provided Office 365 account.\n\nGood luck!",

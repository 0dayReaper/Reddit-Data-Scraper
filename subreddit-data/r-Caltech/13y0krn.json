The main weight room is on the second floor and they discourage dropping heavy weights in there.\n\nIf you want to go heavy and be able to drop to bail out on a rep, there\u2019s a second weight room (with slightly older barbells and racks) and also a third \u201cbarn\u201d weight room that is more like a 1000 sq ft uninsulated metal shed (with slightly rustier barbells).\n\nAll the weight rooms are pretty quiet and I\u2019ve never had problems finding a rack to use without having to share, except when I happen to show up during a sports team\u2019s group workout. (I seem to keep crossing paths with the track team in the fall.)",

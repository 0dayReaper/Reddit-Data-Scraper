    "postText": "Hey guys, I'll be at staying at Caltech for 10 weeks this summer and I was just wondering which dorms you would recommend.  Ill be commuting to JPL every day, I know there are busses that run through campus and such, so I don't think transportation will be an issue.  I have the options of a single room in Avery and South Houses or a double in Avery, North, and South Houses.  \n\nI searched for similiar questions and I found one talking about it but it was 3 years ago and so I thought i'd ask again.  Anyways I'm just looking for general info/insight into what the dorms are like, any information or guidance would be very appreciated. Thanks.",

I would prefer a house that has outgoing people and some organized activities (sounds like Avery is the best option for that).  Thanks again for the help!",

I'm at the point where I don't know if it's worth it to commute or get a place. I wish I could find someone to let me sleep on their floor for like $10/day haha. I just need a sleeping bag.

I go to University of Maryland so im used to a large campus.  I think i'm leaning towards Avery with it being closer to dining and shopping, and i'm not sure how much time i'll be spending in the buildings around campus, so the distance from other buildings shouldn't be a huge issue.\n\nThey are also making us be on the meal plan if we are staying at CalTech so I wanted to ask how the diners work in terms of meal tickets vs buying each individual item.  They are giving us $350 for 10 weeks, do you think that will be enough to provide most of my meals?  I am comfortable with cooking for myself so I am glad you said something about the lounges having kitchens and cookware.",

    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI'm a HS Senior (intl), applying to Caltech for the RD wave. I binged Caltech's CS 156 on YouTube and enjoyed it a lot, and I love research, and it's my absolute dream university. I have a lot of unresolved questions, since unfortunately there's a relative lack of Caltech-specific resources online. If you could help with any of these, I would greatly appreciate it!\n\n\\- Caltech's website lists CS as their most popular major - how much has this changed their focus throughout the years? How engaging is Caltech's pure CS program? On a forum in Quora, someone said they didn't even offer NLProc. This was from \\~2004, what would a 2021 rendition look like?\n\n\\- What has your experience been with Caltech's core curriculum? How does it progress from freshman through senior year? (Rephrased: At what point in your undergraduate career do you dive headfirst into your major?)\n\n\\- How accessible are graduate students and faculty at Caltech? Can I engage myself conducting research under the guidance of professors outside of SURF?\n\n\\- Is ML/AI at Caltech theory focused? What sort of projects would one undertake at Caltech? Can I use Caltech's servers as free real estate for training neural networks?\n\n\\- I'm also interested in cybersecurity research, what opportunities could I take advantage of at Caltech incoporating infosec?\n\nThank you so much for your time and advice!",

            "comment": "I honestly don't feel super qualified to answer most of these (lmao), but I can give you a bit of input:\n\n&gt;how much has this changed their focus throughout the years?\n\nI can't give you a big-picture view, but I can tell you that the CS department's recent hires (for UG classes) have been great lecturers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What has your experience been with Caltech's core curriculum?\n\nIt was alright. Honestly, I was just super scared of proofs going in. I didn't do Ma 0 over the summer (oops), and I struggled in Ma 1a until after midterms. After that, the rest of Ma 1 felt pretty straightforward.\n\nRe: Ch 1, Ph 1-- they were also alright. There were a lot of times when I ran into walls, but that's what friends + collaboration are for.\n\nSome people complain about the humanities courses we have to take, but I tend to like those classes/appreciate that we don't have to deal with math/science all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;At what point in your undergraduate career do you dive headfirst into your major?\n\nThere's not a lot of room in frosh schedules for taking major specific classes. CS students can take Ma 6a (discrete math) during their frosh fall, but I don't think many people do (since 1) you're typically easing into college life, 2) proofs, esp. if you're not already experienced w/ them, and 3) you'd typically have to swap out your frosh hum for another term). Most CS majors take it either sophomore or junior year fall term.\n\nMost CS majors take CS 2 during their frosh winter-- that's your data structures class. Some of them also take CS 21 then in lieu of a humanities course. If you think you're up to the task, then you can go for it. I personally did 2/21 my frosh winter, and I didn't like it. I was honestly not ready to take the class at that time.\n\nCS 24 (computing systems) used to be offered in the spring, (my class was the last batch of frosh that could take it then) but it's been moved to the fall. You can take CS 3 (software design), which was a pretty fun class-- we had to design a game from the ground up in C (fair warning: this might've changed since spring 2019, as it was a freshly redesigned class then).\n\nYou could also do CS 38 (algorithms) your spring term frosh year-- again, if you're up to the task. Most frosh don't, though. (Spring 2020 was an exception-- we were on universal p/f, so people were capitalizing on that opportunity pretty hard.)\n\n\\*CS 1 is offered fall term. Many, many frosh take that class, even if they're not planning on majoring in CS. you can test out if you want-- that'd free up some room in your schedule and allow for Ma 6a your frosh fall without replacing your humanities.",

Something else I forgot to mention is that I'm pretty sure you can major in CS without taking any major requirements until sophomore year (I think the example schedule on the CS major requirements page online shows that). A lot of people usually \"front-load\" their CS classes to some extent (to gain useful knowledge earlier, spread out their courseload a little more).",

            "comment": "Since no one else has talked about infosec:\n\nHi! I run 1064CBread, a [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) team. I brought it with me to Caltech when I went. I have since graduated, but we maintain a solid contingent of current students that play with us. We are generally people who are pretty happy to talk about infosec and assembly hacking and reversing and crypto, but unfortunately I think that constitutes a majority of the infosec exposure that undergrads get at Caltech.\n\nI do know one or two people that did infosec work while at Caltech, in the context of ML threat detection stuff? But it's an area that Caltech is very lacking in.\n\nIn general Caltech's CS program (disclaimer: I was not a CS major) seems to focus a lot on the approach of... \"We'll teach you the 'hard' mathy parts and theorems and theory, actually figuring out how to put it into practice is something you can do on your own, right?\". And something as *\"mechanical\"* as building exploit chains or reversing some assembly or probing firewall rules doesn't really get much attention, then.\n\nBut at the same time, there is a grain of truth in that approach: the undergrads on 1064CBread generally taught themselves everything they needed about cybersecurity, through CTFs and talking with their friends, and seemed content with that.\n\nA few years ago there was one very talented undergrad, with some high-profile exploits to his name, who taught a class on cybersecurity. But that was pretty much a one-time thing.",

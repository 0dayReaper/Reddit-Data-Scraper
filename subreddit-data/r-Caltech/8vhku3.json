    "postText": "Prefrosh here, wondering if anyone has an opinion on Bechtel. I know it's new this fall so no former students have lived there (I'm pretty sure?), but even so I thought I'd ask here. \n\nI like the idea of having a singles dorm and being able to avoid hazing/pressure in houses. I've also heard some pretty weird stories about some house traditions (throwing food at people or having food thrown at you, pressure to drink, etc.). I also realize that these are only singular cases and the majority of people loved the House system. What I want to know is, what do alum/current students think?\n\nEdit: apparently it's against rotation rules for students to tell me to go into/not go into Bechtel, but it'd still be great to hear from people what their house experience was like and why they found the House system appealing or not",

Students one time were persuaded to believe in it and now have fully passed on that belief. Many believe that this has been so prosperous due to the housing system. There is a belief that those not involved with the houses early on will have less interaction with upperclassmen and therefore will be less inclined to believe in the honor code. \n\nOn an individual basis, I honestly don't know you so I can't say what you'd get out of Bechtel. However, I believe that you will be more invested in the security of the honor code when in a house. ",

There are also cases where students initially dislike the house they get in to or the house system as a whole and grow to like it. It\u2019s more than just \u201cgetting a single\u201d in most of these cases.\n\nThe IHC as a whole (the chair doesn\u2019t even get a vote on the Rotation Rules as presidents are the only voting members) voted on the Rotation rules to make sure that first group of people get a voice and are not ostracized for living in Bechtel. We also heavily pushed for students in Bechtel to be able to get memberships so they can still experience the houses if they have to live in Bechtel for other reasons (ie ADA reasons).\n\nI personally have had a great time in the houses, but I recognize that not everyone does. Admin has many different opinions that are not akin to mine (which is why I am upset that my writing is conflated with \u201cadmins\u201d perspective), like houses being too much like frats and sororities or things like \u201cvideo rotation is good.\u201d\n\nI stand by my opinions that you should go through rotation and give the houses a chance. I\u2019m having a great time and a good amount of other students are and have too. But don\u2019t feel bad if you go through rotation and feel comfortable in Bechtel. Don\u2019t feel bad if you go through rotation and hate Bechtel. People feel differently about everything and it\u2019s important to remember that there are always multiple sides to things. ",

The classes are important, but everything I do outside of academics is what makes being here worth it, and my house is a huge part of that. I can pretty firmly say that without it, I would have either flamed out (failed out) or been unable to cope and dropped out. I suspect that's what OP means about keeping undergrads sane.\n\nThe heat in OP's response may come from the sense that Caltech's administration has been trying to kill the house system for years. I would certainly contend that they have. The arbitrary changes made to student life, new and ridiculous policies, and gradually taking agency away from undergraduates all smack of reducing student autonomy and replacing the houses with dorms that you might find at any school. If the houses were only a place to live, then adjusting to a new residential system wouldn't be an issue - but they're so much more than that, and the administration treating them as such is both insulting to the students living in them and ultimately, I feel, detrimental to Caltech as a whole.\n\nAvery is brought up because when the building was constructed in the 90s, it was initially a place for unaffiliated housing (and grad students), sort of like Bechtel but without the suite style living. It was later converted into a house in a contentious decision. I won't say more because I'm not a member of Avery, but you could learn more about that from an Avery member during Rotation.\n\nI'll second a comment above - please go through Rotation and decide where you want to live after that. Once you've seen all the communities for yourself, you'll have more context and will be better able to decide what will be best for you. The one thing I would ask is that you not make your decision before coming to campus and seeing all of your options firsthand.",

It'll be interesting to see how things change even more over time... Hopefully not to the detriment of students though\n\n\n",

(I don't recall the source of the dispute, but she was not being unreasonable.)  She came back from studying and her door was gone.  Taken off the hinges and spirited away.  It was not returned for a day or so.  Privacy gone, safe space absolutely demonstrated not safe.

That's an important thing to figure out. \n\n&gt;What do you mean by \"kept undergrads sane?\"\n\nYou'll find out really quickly that the Caltech course load is extraordinarily heavy. Also, it's very demanding, in terms of brain effort. I did well there, but there's a reason the four year graduation rate is so low compared to other schools. A certain fraction of people just give up, psychologically. The friendships and support structure you get in the houses helps. \n\n&gt;And honestly this is probably gonna sound dumb from an outsider's perspective but why the heat in your response?

Not disagreeing w/ you, just genuinely curious (obviously I can't fully understand your views because as a prefrosh I'm w/o context here). \n\nIt's entirely unclear whether the houses will continue to exist. Oddly, the (somewhat static) cultures endemic to each house often make it much easier for most new student to \"find their place,\" and the current administration has passed rules which will basically remove those static cultures. You can think that \"change is good!\" and you wouldn't ordinarily be wrong, but a solid and reliable support system is, in this case, infinitely better. \n\nYou don't have the perspective that all of the rest of us do about the situation, so your comments come across as \"this all sounds good - anyone disagree?\" There have literally been students protesting on campus for months about this situation, and the whole student body as well as the alumni largely support them. So the heat is to let you know that your views have been shaped by the administration's ad campaigns and that, respectfully, they're a bit garbage. \n\n",

House cultures change from year to year and while things may have been true in a specific house in a specific year, they may no longer be true. \n\nI would highly highly recommend going through rotation because you can still see Bechtel, come to your own conclusions about the houses, and then decide if you like just Bechtel, want to live in Bechtel and get a house affiliation, or if you\u2019d like to live in a house. From my experience, the house system as a whole tends to be a super strong support and social network for those who go into it, and I think it\u2019s worth giving it a shot. That being said, others have different experiences which you can 100% garner better when you\u2019re on campus. ",

            "comment": "I didn't fit in very well with the house system, but I didn't fit in at Caltech in general, and probably would have had trouble anywhere. My house had an initiation ceremony that required getting wet. You could consider it mild hazing. Violating house dinner rules like getting up without permission would result in getting water poured on you. I've heard that other houses sometimes threw food. It was all in fun and relatively harmless, although I didn't care for having dinner rules and the like, and I would not have enjoyed food fights. (The food was kind of bad, though.) I had preconceptions about some houses having relatively scarier cultures, but I think the reputations were overblown, and I was just overly sheltered from my dysfunctional upbringing. I never experienced pressure to drink. You can pretty much opt out of anything you don't want to participate in. I recommend that you participate in rotation and see what it's all about. I'm not sure what the new rules are -- can you go through rotation and then pick Bechtel? \n\nI have met one person, significantly younger than me, who decided not to attend Caltech because of what she had heard about the house cultures. What she heard wasn't really overblown -- she just didn't like the idea of being dunked in the shower or having water poured on her at dinner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "I graduated in 1992.  During my freshman and sophomore years, the upperclassmen in the house I rotated into would go off after dinner during rotation and give scores to the frosh they had met.  If he had not made a good impression, there was a call and response of \"zero ... Lamo ... LOSER\".  This was part of the tradition, and as happens with many traditions, some people set themselves up as custodians and gatekeepers.   The phrase \"not a real (house reference)\" was heard many times.\n\nAnother house, I was told, used the 'XYZ' strategy.  They either picked people they thought would be a good match or 'random xyz foreign student who would live off campus', but would keep paying their (automatically billed) house dues.  \n\nAll in all, it was (in the cases I saw) pretty demeaning.  I would like to think that the other houses were more respectful in their processes.\n\n These were also the days when a decent number of students (including me) 'locked' into houses when there were no more students had selected a house at any ranking, so ... they wound up in their last choice.  Post-rotation, the house where I wound up would tour the other houses to 'shower' (put into a full-nelaon and drag into a  shower) residents of those  houses, singing the gangbang song as they went.\n\nAll in all, it was a poor match, and caused me way more stress than it could have helped.  Most of my friends were in other houses.  \n\nThings got a lot better, I heard, when more women were admitted.  I had already moved into the other housing options and out of my rotated-into house  as soon as I could convince my parents that I would not starve if not on a meal plan.\n\nSome other houses had a much more mellow culture.  At least one was just as strong, but in a different way.  Many people found excellent matches with their houses, I just was not one of them.\n\n I never had a problem with finding support when I was in other tech housing, so I find the notion that students in Bechtel will melt away from a lack of support somewhat dubious -- you will be around a group of other techers.  They will be going through the same ups and downs as you, and would be as mutually supportive as students in the older houses.  Many of your friends will be in other houses, so any notion that you are dependent on only the house where you live for support is somewhere between an oversimplification and a misrepresentation.\n\nPersonally, I like the notion of the upperclassmen (upperclasspeople?) having to represent the house in a positive way rather than being in a position to gatekeep.\n\nI am also a big fan of the house system being somewhat diluted at the start of every year and evolving more over time, rather than calcifying.\n\nFeel free to message me if you want more (rules-compliant) thoughts when I am a bit more coherent.\n\nMobile, autocorrupt, long day at work, blahblahblah\n\nEdit:. Hit 'post' before being done.\n\n",

                    "comment": "Rotation has changed a lot in the past \\~25 years, and a lot of effort has been put (by students) into addressing all of the problems you identify.  Personally, I haven't heard anything said about a prefrosh in rotation that I thought was inappropriate.  In my experience, the overwhelming concern of upperclassmen during rotation is for where the prefrosh would do best.  Many of the problematic behaviors of the past would not be tolerated in the current environment, which also nominally includes RA supervision to provide an additional check on problematic behaviors.\n\nOne of the issues is that none of that work or positive improvement has been recognized by current administrators.  Around the time when the Bechtel decision was released, a lot of administrators and alumni brought up stories about bad things that happened in past rotations that current students universally agreed were bad behaviors or practices.  They also hadn't happened in the past decade.  Before the process was unilaterally upended, students had made a lot of progress improving the system, and one of the things that bothers me about the way admin has been approaching rotation changes is the complete lack of respect for decades of careful work and research by students to improve the process themselves.  It turns out rotation is a hard problem, and I for one have no confidence in a unilateral \"solution\" being anything other than a source of more problems.\n\nThat got long and a little off topic, oops.  TLDR, there have definitely been problems with rotation, but issues from 20+ years ago have largely been resolved, and are a poor justification of unilaterally changing the system students have continuously worked to improve.",

                            "comment": "That's really good to hear.  I think that RA presence in the post-dinner evaluations would have moderated some of the more blatant behaviors.\n\nHearing that the students have improved the process over the years is good to know.  I would be curious to hear how much the adjusting of the gender ratio (6-7:1 my frosh/sophomore years) had to do with mellowing it out, but that would probably also vary immensely by house as well.  A lot of the more toxic behaviors were tamped down around women.  My year, the house only had 2 women enter, so ... yeah.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, there was student pushback over unilateral admin rule changing even back in my day.  The director of residence life position was stood up after an incident of public ... erm, 'intimacy' after a party in a courtyard which may have involved a 17-year old (I never heard all of the details), and which got picked up by the media.   (At least, there was a  dictate that if the media came  by, to direct them to the media office.)  A bunch of student off-campus housing on holliston  (mostly off-campus alleys for the  houses) was torn down to build a parking structure.  The number of 7-house parties was cut.  IIRC, Interhouse may have been only 5 houses, or that might have been the only all-house party remaining.  (I was not a party person, and it was a quarter-century ago.) \n\nSome alum came by one night and talked about how the houses were able to determime whether or not to accept women individually, and how that house was the last to accept them.  The house president gave an incredibly impassioned speech about how it would kill the house, but wound up losing the vote.  Allegedly, he wound up marrying a woman who was among the first in the house.\n\nAll of those were expected to be horrible impediments to house culture, but it lived on.  I wouldn't think of this as an apocalypse, but just as another stage.\n\nThanks for the follow-up, and non illigitimus carborundum.\n\n Edit: autocorrupt fix\n",

    "postText": "My interests lie in psychology, politics, and economics, but pretty open to anything. I know that's a pretty broad ask but currently I'm cross-enrolled here and get to take some courses here so figured I'd hope to get the most out of this (my college is mad expensive...as is any).\n\nMy career right now is in (UX) research, although classes wise I'm seeking anything really and doesn't necessarily have to contribute to career development but really anything fascinating is cool (If it was career it'd be maybe design/human factors/ethnography/research based classes but at this time anything is cool). I've taken a look at the catalog but looking in possible classes when I sign up again.",

Sullivan's English/VC courses are excellent. \n\nCritical making is a fun class if you enjoy making things and want to think more about the history of maker/DIY culture. It involves doing projects and talking about them, so if you like UX it could be fun to do something with. \n\nGame theory is of course the classic Caltech econ class. Camerer teaches behavioral economics, which is mostly \"Camerer trash talks other economists\" which imo is a great class.",

Not the Catalina Apartments, but rather the [off-campus apartments on S Catalina Ave](https://housing.caltech.edu/grads/gradaute-housing-lottery-contract-rates). \n\nIt notes that we need to provide our own internet, I was just wondering if it was a restricted provider or if there was a preferred provider in the area from other student's experience.",

They have a few different speeds that arent terrible for the money and they are relatively consistent. If you are willing to put up with slower internet speeds for free I do know that in some of those apartments you can connect to Caltech wifi but I really wouldn't count on that.",

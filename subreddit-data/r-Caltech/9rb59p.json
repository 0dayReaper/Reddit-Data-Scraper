    "postText": "# What is a \"Canary Page\"? Warrant Canary? Gag Order In Effect?\n\nI was trying to visit [https://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/](https://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/), but only the non-TLS (\"http://\") version displays the website.\n\nThe HTTPS version displays (what is assumed to be) a warrant canary in a cage ('trapped') with a gas mask (assumed to be a symbol for 'gagged').\n\nThe HTTP version displays the expected content.\n\nWhat's up with this? Is this a sign of a Government gag order? If this isn't likely to be a gag order, why wouldn't they include *additional* text? An HTTPS configuration gone (disconcertingly) wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*EDIT #1:*\n\n# If you visit the link above, you'll most likely get an error (\"Privacy Error,\" \"Security Error,\" etc.) from your browser about the website's certificate.\n\n**For Chrome**, click the text towards the bottom labeled, \"ADVANCED,\" then click on the \"Proceed to ...\" link to ignore the error. You'll still see a red ('unsecure') padlock in the URL/Navigation bar after doing so.\n\n**For Firefox**, click the button towards the bottom labeled, \"ADVANCED,\" then scroll down and click the \"Add Exception\" button.\n\nA window will pop up: uncheck \"Permanently Store this Exception,\" and lastly just click the button \"Confirm Security Exception.\"\n\n# Here's what I'm seeing when viewing the HTTPS version:\n\n[The Certificate window is just a part of Windows. Don't mind it.](https://preview.redd.it/45tuyzfkedu11.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=470d08d6ce35733a50c54abd06dcded0bbfc4122)",

Symbolism-wise I doubt the clarity of a gas mask being a \"gag\" order, since gas masks let you speak but keep you alive...but I'm not up to date on that kind of thing. ",

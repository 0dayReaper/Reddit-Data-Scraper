I've always been used to sitting in an exam hall to take my tests and there's something about that atmosphere that makes me perform better than I would normally do at home. \n\nSo far, every practice test in the SAT or ACT that I've take has had a lesser score than the actual exam.\n\nThe idea of being trusted and given a lot of freedom is something that I do like though. Speaking of the honor code, does this mean that you can just walk into a lab when you need to, take a few readings and then go back home? What amount of trust does administration put in students? What is crossing the limit?",

From house resources to the freedom to take exams on your own to access to buildings late at night, the honor code keeps things running smoothly. ",

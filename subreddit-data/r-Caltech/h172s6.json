    "postText": "Hello! So I am American, I lived in Utah until I moved to Belgium at 12 years old. Here in Belgium I have done 1 year in an international school (a second 6th grade), and have done my 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th year in a normal school. I've always dreamed of going to Caltech and I wanted to know if I could get in as an American without the SAT (since here there is only the CESS). Here applying to a university is very different compared to American university, any ideas of what I should do? should I get my CESS and then come back to the US to do an international year and try to get the SAT? \n\nThanks for your help!\n\n\\~Thien",

When I was applying, I was an American citizen who had been living in Germany and going to German school.\n\nIt seems like CESS is your high school leaving examinations. This isn't really equivalent to the SAT. The SAT is an aptitude test which covers math and reading skills. Anyway, I don't think you necessarily need to wait to finish your high school leaving examinations in order to apply to Caltech. The standard timeline -- applying in the fall of your last year of school, and getting decisions in January (if early action) or March (if regular decision) -- should be fine. In my case, I got my Caltech acceptance before I had even taken any of my leaving examinations. Caltech doesn't really care, as long as you've been academically strong until that point. (By contrast, I've heard of Cambridge rescinding acceptances to Germans who don't do well enough on their leaving examinations.)\n\nFrom what I understand, Caltech admissions (and most American college admissions) don't have the capacity to understand the subtleties of foreign school systems. There are two main strategies to overcome this: 1) Go to a school which has a working relationship with the AOs, 2) Get achievements which an American audience can easily interpret and put into context. It sounds like you are in situation #2. I suggest trying to get a research opportunity or work on a personal project, since those don't have as much local context. By contrast, doing really well in a national competition might be overlooked. \n\nFor what it's worth, if it were me, I'd still take the SAT even if it were optional. I have no idea whether it helps, but if you think you can get a good score, it can't hurt. \n\nGood luck.",

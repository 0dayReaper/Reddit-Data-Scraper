    "postText": "I'm leaving the Pasadena area for San Francisco, and my current roommate will need someone to take my place starting January 2016. \n\nThe unit is blocks from PCC, and was recently renovated (~2013) with new appliances. You'd be living with one PCC student (male). No preference for male or female roommate, but a student or recent grad is preferred.\n\nAmenities include:\n\n* Private bedroom with walk-in closet \n\n* Private full bath (en suite)\n\n* Fully furnished common areas\n\n* Off-street parking\n\n* Walking distance to PCC, Caltech, and the Gold Line\n\nThis would be for a 12 month lease - cost is $875/mo. plus utilities. PM me for more details!",

    "postText": "Prefrosh here! I am currently considering whether or not it is worthwhile to try to place out of the math and physics first year courses. I have taken Calculus BC, AP Physics 1 and C as well as a bit of multivariable calculus, special relativity and quantum mechanics. However, I'm sure the Caltech introductory courses go more in depth to the material than I have experienced before. **Will I benefit from taking the courses anyway?** **Do any older undergrad students have advice from experience with skipping courses (or not)?** Thanks, and can't wait to start in September!",

            "comment": "If your background is just AP classes you should take all of core.  The math courses in particular will be very different from your AP coursework.  Caltech math has a much, much stronger emphasis on proofs compared to AP math, which is more oriented towards problem solving.  I think that the math placement exam is more to see whether or not you are required to enroll in section 1 or Ma 8, which provide more help to students who don't have as much of a background in proofs.\n\nAs I recall the first part of the first term of physics was similar in spirit to AP physics (Newtonian mechanics).  But it transitions to special relativity by the end of the term and then E&amp;M in the second term is taught on the relativistic foundations from the first term.  This approach is much more principled, but less commonly taught so you may not have encountered it before.  I don't think you can place out of more than the first year of physics classes, so you'll be required to take quantum and waves regardless.\n\nGranted it's been a few years since I took these classes so the syllabus could have changed.  Definitely do as well as you can on the placement exams!  But don't be surprised if you're not given the option to place out of core.  It's rare for people to place out of core.",

            "comment": "If you can place out of any of the courses, you might as well. Worst case you lose a couple hours of your life to taking the placement tests? As I recall, ma1a was very proof-focused and not material I\u2019d really seen before, but ma1b and ma1c were kind of a waste of time for one who had a reasonable multi/linalg background. Ph1 doesn\u2019t cover a lot of material outside the scope of AP physics but the problems are considerably more challenging.\n\nEdit: this is specifically in reference to the analytic track of those two courses.",

I learned a lot more than I did in undergrad.\n\nI would recommend taking the courses unless there is a great benefit to placing out of them. It's important to get a solid foundation.",

Hope you got in somewhere good..?\n\nBut my actual thought reading your commentary: what the heck is a \"6.7\" GPA? In any system I've heard of, the maximum GPA possible is 5.0. I *did* once read a newspaper article about a girl who had some stupid GPA of 12.0, because her school started *adding* to the GPA for each AP class taken. Which is, well, obviously just meaningless it call it a grade point \"average\" then.\n\nHow/why do you have classes weighted as (I'm guessing) a 7 out of 4?",

I tried to find out but nobody knows except one person and that is God! \n\nI like Indian IIT college admission process, no bullshit, totally merit based, They publish merit list openly to the public, and students are free to choose their colleges based on their merit but not colleges. That is why IITians are so successful.",

You r super qualified, so your not getting in probably came down to your essays or something not as quantifiable. I'm sure you'll get into another elite institution, though. Good luck!",

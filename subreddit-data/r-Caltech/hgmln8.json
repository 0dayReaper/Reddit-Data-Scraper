I was thinking about applying since I thought it would help me in admissions since my test scores are generally in the 25th percentile (31-33 act), yet I've read it kind of doesn't matter since almost all of CalTech's admits have very prestigious awards like AIMES or AMC and CalTech isn't really as holistic as other schools such as the Ivies and MIT. Is this true?",

They will absolutely take into account if your school was \"trash\" and you did not have as many opportunities as other applicants perhaps. My high school didn't have olympiad either (at least until I started one in junior year) and was pretty mediocre all around. It was only when I went to Caltech that i realized how much further ahead everyone else was (particularly the people from the pricey private schools and competitive Bay area high schools), how much more accomplished they were, and how much slack  admissions gave me.",

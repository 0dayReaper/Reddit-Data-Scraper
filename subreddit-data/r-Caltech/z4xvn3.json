I hope to attend Caltech in the future, and I thought I should develop the habits in advance(that is, if I get in). \n\nDo you have any tactics/study habits/routines you do to handle a heavy course load?\n\nThanks, and I hope the rest of your studies at Caltech go well. Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this post.",

            "comment": "Let me lead by saying that this should not inform your decision of whether or not to attend.\n\n1) Hookups occur often for a small group of people, but Caltech is very well known for the extremely stable long term relationships. A very high number of couples get married. \n\n2) People at Caltech are very smart, but Caltech is not known for the attractiveness of its student body. How successful you are with dating/casual encounters depends on you. There aren't many good looking people on campus. Glomming is a thing. One attractive girl will usually have 5-7 guys trying very hard.\n\nI never had trouble with my sex life at Caltech, but in fairness there are quite a few people who are lonely and vocal about being unable to find a partner, casual or otherwise. I feel however though that this is less due to Caltech and more due to how many people who go to Caltech are socially awkward because they have been studying very hard all their lives and spent less time socializing. Caltech instituted their house system back in the day because students were so antisocial that they decided forcing everyone into a frat-like system would improve social interactions. These people end up alone because they either don't or don't know how to go out and meet people.\n\nCaltech is a great place for finding a life partner. It's not the best for hookups *on campus*. Also remember that the student body is tiny and everyone knows your dirty laundry. \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that although Caltech easily becomes the whole world to some people who go there, you're right next to LA.\n\nA lot of guys, myself included, used to all head out to UCLA or USC to parties to meet people for casual encounters. Both of those schools are nearby and well known for their models/sororities/cheerleaders. You're also just a train ride away from Hollywood and lots of actresses. If you put in the effort and are sociable, your options are many.\n\nI met my current fiance-soon-to-be-wife at an anime convention in LA. She was one of the cosplayers.",

This. This.  It's such a small community that you know who hooks up with who and how many, etc.\n",

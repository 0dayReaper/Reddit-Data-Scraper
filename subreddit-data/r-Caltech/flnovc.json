    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI\u2019ve been admitted to Caltech\u2019s graduate program in Applied Physics, and am trying to weigh in my options (especially since the visiting weekend got canceled due to the COVID-19 situation).\n\nI was wondering how graduate students find the social atmosphere of Caltech... are there a variety of things to do on campus or in Pasadena?\n\nI\u2019m also concerned about the size of Caltech. I actually like the small size, but am worried about being able to find people that I clique with. How has your experience finding a social group been?\n\nThanks in advance!",

So if you instead have a small community where EVERYONE is like that, suddenly you're actually surrounded by waaaaay more \"potential friends\" than you would be anywhere else.\n\nIf that doesn't sound comforting, you might not be the right target personality for Caltech (though again this is based on my undergrad experience) but if it does you should be fine!!",

Indeed, I ended up meeting my spouse through my office-mate.\n\nCaltech a small place with about 1200 graduate students and I never felt there was a shortage of things to do, either a formal event or a spontaneous get-together (also, here's a list of [clubs](https://apply.clubs.caltech.edu/clubs). You're most likely to make friend with your lab-mates or folks in a nearby lab but it is possible to break out and meet people all over. That is one of the cool things about the small size is that it is easy to ask \"hey, what department are you in and what are you working on?\" because you're all already in a special clique of Caltech\n\nPasadena is a great place to live (if you can afford the rent) with a variety of nearby activities. There's excellent hiking and mountain biking, world class museums (Huntington and Norton Simon), an ice skating rink, a bustling shopping district, movie theaters (first run, arty, and discount), great food, etc. If you are feeling antsy, it is really easy to drive or catch the metro to downtown LA.\n\nI hope this helps, and congrats again!",

I think generally pre-med at Tech is a hard road because it's often very hard to get good grades in Caltech's classes, but I don't know much about nursing. \n\nI will say that if you do end up at Caltech, you should look into the Health Ad program, where you can take a yearlong 3-unit course to get an EMR certification and help keep people on campus safe.",

    "postText": "Hi All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of applying to one of the graduate programs of Computing + Mathematical Sciences. I am especially excited to take the course Applied+ Computational Mathematics. I will apply this December. Can you help me out with what kind of background I need to apply to this course? Any do's/ dont's?  How is the funding situation? Because I am coming from a economically weak family and wont be able to afford exorbitant fees. Is is fine to share my academic background over here to give a clearer picture?",

I wanted to go into applications of comp sci so I left that job after a year. And started my Masters in Scientific Computing (Pune University). I am currently working on a Bioinformatics project- Genome annotation and protein mapping : case study of RNA viruses.",

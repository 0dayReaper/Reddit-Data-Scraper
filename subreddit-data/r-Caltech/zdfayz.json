            "comment": "I was surprised to see the name appear in the essay, too, and it was a real eyebrow-raiser. But I read what he wrote carefully and I think what he wrote was fine, actually. To be precise:\n\n* He only mentioned Millikan once in the essay\n* He only mentioned Millikan as a \"conduit of talent\", never as a contributor or scientist or writer in his own right (so, nothing remotely condoning of his *work*)\n* Like it or not, Millikan is a key figure in the history of Caltech, and a figure extremely relevant in particular to the parallels and relationship between Caltech and Bell Labs.\n\nI realize you could ask that Tombaum would *actively decry* Millikan in the context of the essay. Personally, I think the way he handled it was pretty alright; keep the mention of him to the bare minimum required for the story (he created a link) and say nothing positive of him. If someone disagrees with me, I could probably be convinced that it was... impolite(?) of Tombaum to mention him, or to mention him and not actively decry him in the same breath. But I don't think I could be convinced that Tombaum did something really wrong.\n\nNot gonna lie OP, given your post history in this sub (which was already all deleted a while ago), I'm not totally convinced you want to actually engage with this topic seriously.",

However, I still have issue with his anti-trust busting sentiment at the very end and felt the story was a bit weird as a final send off. I don't think Tommy was doing anything intentionally bad, just a bit insensitive.",

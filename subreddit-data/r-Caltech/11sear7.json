I\u2019ll let others weigh in on this tho",

Actually, you might pay less, depending on how old the other two kids are-- if they're close to college age, you might qualify for more aid. \n\nThere's another trick, although it won't help you this year (because freshmen are required to live on campus for the first year); he can move off campus next year. I was told (back in 2014, so keep in mind that finaid policies might have changed since) that financial aid wouldn't change significantly if I moved off campus in my sophomore year. If your son knows how to drive and can cook, he can save thousands of dollars by getting a couple of roommates and living in a nearby town.",

Scholarships are not going to cut it unless you land some kind of high profile national scholarship.  \n\nAverage college graduates usually graduate with $20-$30k in debt, so it's worth asking your son if he's willing to do that.  Then, ask yourself if your budget is really as inflexible as you think it is.  For example, do you go on a big vacation every year?  How much could you save by going camping instead?  I remember when I was in college my parents told me the most they could afford to contribute was $100/month. I was going into debt, skipping meals, and working 30 hours a week on top of classes to make the budget work. It was pretty annoying to then see them going on $10,000 luxury vacations I wasn't even invited to.  So just be sure you're being honest with yourself about what you could afford if you were to really try to tighten the belt and prioritize your son's education.\n\nOn a separate note, it's super annoying that Caltech even charges undergraduate tuition which is like 1% of their operating budget, a rounding error.  It's really inexcusable to put kids in debt and put parents through hell for the sake of a line item that doesn't even matter for their budget.  So, I feel for you.  Good luck!",

That money can't be spent on, e.g., another less-than-useless ORE rule enforcer; it has to be given to an undergraduate with financial need. Works out great that way, because I'd be super-pissed if my money was spent on ORE flunkies.",

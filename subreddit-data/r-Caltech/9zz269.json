    "postText": "I'm from a different country and I'm following Golwala's notes for Ph106ab ,bc and Ph125ab. Assignments of Classical Mechanics and Quantum mechanics courses are available online, but ph106bc Classical electrodynamics assignments can only be accessed from Caltech server. Could some gentle soul please share the assignments and question papers? Here is the link\nhttp://www.astro.caltech.edu/~golwala/ph106bc/\n\nMay ~~god~~ universe bless you with good sleep and grades.\nThank you ",

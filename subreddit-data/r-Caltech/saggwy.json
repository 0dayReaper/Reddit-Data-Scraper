    "postText": "Hey! Wanted to put a note here to gauge interest. I'm a cofounder of a tech startup and we are contemplating moving our headquarters from Denver to LA. One of the locations that was thrown out was Pasadena since it's less congested than the west side of LA and also has Caltech as a potential talent pool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am curious though, how is Pasadena from a student/early grad perspective for those of you who are working/looking to work in tech. Is there any appeal to working full-time in Pasadena? Or do most students/early grads who stay in LA head to Santa Monica/Culver City for work?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, is there much of a tech startup scene in Pasadena?",

There\u2019s less traffic for people commuting from the  south and west. \n\nI don\u2019t know the rental price of local business space, but there are plenty of places if you\u2019re thinking about having a headquarters for meetings, etc. \n\nYou also have the pool of graduates from the other universities in the county.",

I didn't have a car but I was pretty much always fine with just an occasional Uber to take my cat to the vet or something along those lines. I was in walking distance to multiple grocery stores, a ton of restaurants, movie theater, mall, etc. This was about 8 years ago so it's probably a bit different now but I'm sure it's on the whole mostly the same. Definitely would be happy to live there again one day though as others have said, it's very expensive, which is a lot of why I left, since I work remotely.",

If you're considering moving to the area it might also be worth reaching out to TenOneTen although there are definitely more funds on the west side.",

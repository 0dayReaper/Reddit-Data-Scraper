    "postText": "I just walked past an alumni lunch event on campus. It looked like each attendee had registered in advance to order the type of sandwich they wanted to eat. But the system for distributing sandwiches was cringe-worthy and anxiety-triggering. Everyone had name tags - for socializing purposes - which they had to take to the sandwich table to get their food. The caterers knew which sandwich to provide each alumnus because their order was printed on their name tag. Now, I'm uncomfortable announcing to the world my sandwich preferences; I feel like this system would have discouraged consumption of exotic sandwiches except I doubt anyone expected to be outed when they signed up. But the worst part was the layout of the name tags: all the text was in the same size and font. From a distance, I figured the name tags read, for example, \"John Doe: Class of '84\" or \"Jane Doe: Software Engineer at Microsoft,\" but as I neared the mass of awkwardly small-talking ex-students I realized to my amusement their identifiers were all of the form \"Mary Smith: Ham Sandwich\" or \"Bill Johnson: Turkey and Cheese.\" Just terrible. Had I been part of the event I would have left out of embarrassment once this incompetence was revealed to me but only after snatching up my badge from the registration table as to conceal my secret identity as a \"BLT hold the onions.\" And just imagine the icebreakers: not \"BS in Physics? me too!\" but rather \"So how was the roast beef?\" Luckily today I could observe from a safe and private distance. I considered lying my way into free food as I often do, but then I thought of the poor alumnus who would drive across the state in search of nostalgic moments with old buddies only to discover his meticulously planned sandwich missing, the scarlet letter pinned to his chest a constant reminder of his hunger and a testament, in the eyes of his peers, to his deeply held sandwich preferences - the very core of who he had become since graduating. Empathy overcame schadenfreude; I just couldn't do it.",

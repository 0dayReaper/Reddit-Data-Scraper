    "postText": "Hey!\n\nSo I'm a rising senior and Caltech's my absolute dream school. My grades really aren't Caltech level (top 8% of class, and I got a 92 in AP Physics sophomore year but I'm the only person I know who got above a 3 on the AP test from my school, which I'm really worried about because I want to apply for Physics) which I think is mostly due to my ADHD which has gone undiagnosed until really recently. But, I'm doing a physics research project that I've been pouring 12+ hours a day into for the past few weeks and I have a provisional patent on another research project that I'm trying to commercialize, I created a STEM organization that's legitimately impactful, and more. Are the AOs going to be able to look past my grades? I also have a big upward trend btw, and my UW is 3.97 and weighted is 5.34.\n\nThank you so much for your time!",

Then it's Engineering - and those folks get weeded out too :)\n\nDon't sweat your AP score just yet.  Tech has their own placement exams.  (Sarcastically, it's \"Wow!  You took AP Physics?  You're just like every single other person at Caltech.\")\n\nYour extracurriculars are solid though.  I'd stick with those.  If you can take a college course or two, that can help - but either way.  Just keep at it.  I think you'll do okay.",

So there\u2019s definitely a possibility that the rest of the application can overcome weaker grades.",

Otherwise, they would just blend into whatever house they were in for rotation.  \n\nMy guess would be that the only folks who would probably actually move/be moved would be the ones where there was a fairly serious mismatch, like serious athletes in Dabney (stereotype from my days, last millennium).\n\nOver time, I would expect the houses to become a bit more generic, which may or may not be a good thing.  Off-campus used to be the outlet for those of us who were not well-mannered with the houses that had more 'personality'.  This would probably need to be used less.",

            "comment": " Current rotation data suggests it's highly successful with regards to student satisfaction, and academic success has little to no correlation with house membership (at least not on any timescale that would indicate inherent or persistent culture differences with regards to academics). So, there's not really a reason for rotation to be later (or, more generally, a reason for it changed to a significant degree at all). \n\nOn a more personal level, I feel like a prolonged rotation would badly homogenize the houses, and while that might be more comfortable for some people, it would deny more vibrant experiences to those who want to seek them out in where they live. The beauty of the house system is that it manages to be highly successful at providing and placing people in places that suit them (I mean this both in terms of comfort and in terms of opportunities to grow).",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. So I got an email about a months-long competition put on by an aircraft company (Daher) which is partnering with Microsoft. Apparently they are interested in a wide array of technological innovation when it comes to either user-experience in their aircraft, or operating capabilities of their aircraft. \n\nWhen I saw the event it piqued my interest because my research (I'm a grad student in CMS) involves optimization problems with applications to aircraft design. While it's not realistic for me to be a part of this endeavor (I'll be doing research at a mathematics institute Germany during key phases of the competition), I figured it may be of interest to GALCIT people.\n\nYou can find a link to the main event page here: https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2551266431559116&amp;id=2337565229595905.\n\nDisclaimer: that link doesn't provide much concrete direction on the hackathon. You should contact the organizers if you want more info.",

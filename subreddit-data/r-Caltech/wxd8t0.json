            "comment": "All Caltech undergraduates are guaranteed some sort of on campus housing all four years. Financial aid is usually pretty generous and will include living expenses if Caltech considers that you need it.\n\nCaltech admissions are also need blind and financial aid is 100% need-based. If you get in, you'll obtain your financial aid offer before you have to decide on whether to attend so you'll be able to make an informed decision.\n\nFeel free to dm if you have more questions!",

I would contact [housing](https://housing.caltech.edu) by email (housing@caltech.edu) or phone (626-395-6176, Mon-Fri 8AM-5PM PST) for the most up-to-date information, since policies for new students may be different from those for returning students. \n\nYou can also try contacting [admissions](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu) by email (ugadmissions@caltech.edu) or phone (626-395-6341, Mon-Fri 8AM-5PM PST) since QuestBridge Scholars may receive different funds for housing due to the nature of the program. The [QuestBridge liason](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/questbridge-applicants) at Caltech is Karla Arriaga, who may be able to answer questions more thoroughly than general admissions. \n\nHope this helps!",

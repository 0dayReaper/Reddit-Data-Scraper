I've heard stories of coaches promising things to prospective students but as far as I know admissions doesn't actually listen to them, even if those coaches are used to having sway at other schools.\n\nWhat matters most to Caltech will be your academics and interests. Sports really aren't a focus, but do help make a rounded and interesting application if you're also top-tier academically and passionate about STEM and more.",

If you have a genuine interest your passion will shine through when you write your essays and prepare your materials - and that's what makes an app stand out. \n\nEdit: one small e.g. just taking a very quick glance at your post history - your interest in books is the kind of small thing you can geek out about a few times in essays etc. and it'll look personal and passionate. Also outdoors and soccer do look good, don't discount them just bc they're not a silver bullet! Doing very well academically, having some interests (any, not just STEM) you engage with and can show it, and writing a bit about what you may want to do with those skills and passions in STEM or why they lead you there or round your perspective out beyond your current studies can easily be enough.",

But you will still need stellar grades, essays, and test scores (I guess those aren't required anymore?) So you can't just rely on recruitment and \"good enough\" grades to get in.",

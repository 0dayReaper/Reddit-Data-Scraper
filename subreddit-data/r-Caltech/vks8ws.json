                    "comment": "I got a job in a research lab on campus at Caltech while taking the last class of my bachelor's degree at a nearby UC. In other words, it's complicated but I tend to fit well with other students my age rather than 30-somethings when it comes to room mates. I will be around for 2-3 years so I am hoping to find someone for at least a year. As I am just barely finished with my Bachelor's, I am looking for something affordable. I'm already well accustomed to living with room mates therefore I would rather not rent something in Pasadena (aka expensive) without doubling or at least having a room mate to cut the cost. However, as I am not technically a 'student' at Caltech, I have not been able to join the many pages where I would have looked for this. Any advice?",

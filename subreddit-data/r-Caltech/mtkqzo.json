    "postText": "Hello, r/Caltech! This question sorta travels down the same vein as [one I just read](https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/mr8qqy/placement_tests_at_caltech/) on here, but I'm wondering what kinds of content to expect on a diagnostic or placement exam. For instance, on the diagnostic exam for math, would brushing up on a sample AP Calculus AB/BC exam essentially be the extent of it, or should I expect questions more in line with the actual Math 1a practice sets (e.g. [this](http://www.math.caltech.edu/~nets/prac2.pdf))?\n\nI'm just hoping to be placed correctly, and so I'm not sure if the diagnostic is more like an AP exam than the sample practice set I found above. Additionally, then, would placement exams for Math 1abc, 2, and 3 be similar to the practice set I found above (as opposed to an AP-style exam)? Thanks, guys!",

            "comment": "The relevant AP tests/classes are probably about right for the diagnostics; iirc they were probably a bit easier than the class itself. The placement tests on the other hand will probably have more content than their high school counterparts, especially Ma1a, because while it does cover single variable calculus, it also does a lot of proof intro.",

            "comment": "The diagnostic math exam is basically just the AP Calc BC test, maybe even a little easier. At least when I took it (last year), it was pretty much all computational. As long as you know how to take derivatives and integrals and know their significance, you\u2019ll be good to go. \n\nSomeone else may be able to tell you more about the placement exams. I didn\u2019t attempt any.",

I was bummed when I didn't place out of a class but the class ended up being super challenging and a great learning experience. So, feel free to study up, but the good news is whether or not you are \"placed correctly\" you'll be fine.",

            "comment": "I would just study all of your course materials from the classes you took in high school, and do some practice problems, focusing on proofs as much as you can rather than like just randomly solving integrals or whatever. If you're able to pass based on that, awesome! If not, that's okay! You'll learn a lot in ma1! Don't see this as a time for learning an entirely new set of information, just see it as an opportunity to find out if what you already learned overlaps with what they teach in ma1.\n\nSo DO take the placement exams seriously, and DO study for them, but DON'T try and cram a ton of brand-new material for them.\n\nedit - FWIW: I placed out of ma1abc (like 12 years ago when I was a prefrosh), and I never looked at a single ma1abc homework set or syllabus or anything. My high school curriculum was pretty proof-based I guess? I was in the same track as the OP of the other thread - calc BC smore year, MV/linal jr year. I definitely had forgotten a lot of stuff with the gap sr year, and reviewing is SUPER worth it, but looking at ma1 stuff shouldn't need to be, if your hs curriculum actually prepared you enough.",

Are there any cool things happening in/around campus anytime soon?\n\nI'm guessing you guys are having finals now/soon, but that's not too bad is it?",

And I'd love to meet everyone! Grads-undergrads-not grads. I'm in my final year of UG, so I feel like I fit in with them all.\n\nAnd yeah, good luck with the finals.",

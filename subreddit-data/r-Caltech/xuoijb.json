I've been told that I would require a background in physics and astronomy but i can't decide if i qualify. I am sorry for spamming but I really need someone actually working in this field to help me out! Thank you in advance :)",

Or, you could skip the cold emailing and just look at peoples' CVs in order to get a sense of what backgrounds Caltech astro grad students have. Best of luck.",

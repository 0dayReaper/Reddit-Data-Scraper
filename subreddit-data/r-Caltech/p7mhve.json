Parking looks insanely exspensive at $70 and increasing to $80 in January. Are there any other cheaper alternatives to have access to my car in Pasadena?",

No overnight parking on almost all streets (few exceptions, but not that close to campus), and two hour parking limits during the day in most parts of the city.",

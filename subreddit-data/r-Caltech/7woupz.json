I've looked at Places4Students and found 1 search result for a short-term lease, so that stinks. If anyone has any advice or knows someone looking to sublet, please let me know!",

            "comment": "Hello, \n\nAfter reviewing your comment and our listings page, have you looked under other search results such as month-to-month, no lease, 3 month lease, etc? We currently have multiple listings available under those search criteria in the 'Property Listings' tab. We also have a 'Short Term Rentals' tab for you to review. \n\nWe generally notice an influx of listings closer to the summer for student sublets and others looking to rent out summer vacancies once tenants give their notice. Check back within the coming weeks/over the next month or so. We should have more options for you then!\n\nGood luck on your search and feel free to contact our office at 1-866-766-0767 should you have any questions about searching for rental options. We'd be happy to help you.",

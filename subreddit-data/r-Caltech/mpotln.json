Ma 1a is still very proof-based now but that is a core class, Ma1b and Ma1c are also proof-based if you take the analytical track (but not if you take the practical track which many engineering majors do). Many of the engineering majors do not have many proof-based math courses after that, but majors like CS, Physics, and of course Math do.",

Part of it was also a disconnect between what seems to be a proof in physics (were simplifying assumptions are expected) and one in math where it's assumed to be rigorous.\n\nLike, take a look at the AP Calculus curriculum which has been unchanged, afaik, for decades as what's taught to most calculus students. Caltech assumes their Math 1a isn't their first calc class, and decides to retread it in a more rigorous manner.",

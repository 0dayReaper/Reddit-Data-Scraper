It started as a class of ~5 undergrads and 20 grad students. By third term it was just three undergrads getting essentially personal lectures from a senior JPL engineer. Truly amazing stuff.",

            "comment": "I thoroughly enjoyed Ma151 (Algebraic Topology) and CS 139 (Advanced Algorithms). It's not that the classes were fantastically well presented or the lectures were great, just that the material really made an impression on me in a positive way. Those will really just be of interest to Ma/ACM/CS folk though, though.\n\nPl/HPS 122 was \"Bioethics\" and was a really great philosophy class. I had a distinctly bad experience in the intro philosophy class, \"Right and Wrong\", and in that intro class it seemed there were a few students there just to make inflammatory comments for the sake of fun. I *also* did not like the Intro HPS class, and had a bad time there too. But Bioethics was great! It tackled a lot of (imo) really interesting tricky questions, like eugenics or triage strategy -- and without devolving into reactionary arguments. I think that course was just taught once by a visiting lecturer, though, and I don't see it in the course catalog in recent years. Sad.\n\nPl/HPS 122, \"Probability, Evidence, and Belief\" was also a great time and affected my perspective on what 'chance' is at a pretty core level. This may have mattered disproportionately to me, as someone doing quantum information. :)\n\nFinally, I strongly recommend Hiking as a PE. I made lasting friends in that class! Friends with people in other houses, in different years, that I'm still in touch with! And I actually learned a lot of physics there too. Turns out hikes are great for that.",

            "comment": "An incomplete list of my favorite classes:\n\n* CS 128 (n\u00e9e CS 101\u20132), Interactive Theorem Proving with Mike Vanier: I fell in love with the course material, to the point that it's what I'm planning to do in grad school (and beyond). Interactive theorem proving is an utterly fascinating blend of computer science and mathematics, and it's an incredibly deep field (it even has significant overlap with foundations of mathematics)! Also, because this course is based largely on free material, you can basically take it on your own by working through the interactive [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/toc.html) \"textbook\"!\n* EE 1, The Science of Data, Signals, and Information with PPV: Really chill class, but also showed me that information theory isn't just an \"EE thing\" but is actually really cool from a mathematical perspective.\n* CS 24, Introduction to Computing Systems with Adam Blank: The class was very well-taught, and the projects were *very* cool.\n* Ph 1b Analytical, special relativity and electrostatics with David Hsieh: Very well taught, and absolutely mindblowing. This class made me realize that I really like physics, and inspired me to take more physics classes throughout my Caltech career.\n* Ph 2b, Quantum Mechanics with Cliff Cheung: Same as above: so, so mindblowing.\n* CS 21, Decidability and Tractability with Chris Umans: Extremely well-taught, and very interesting.\n* CS 156a, Learning Systems with Yaser Abu-Mostafa: This class is actually freely [available on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-from-data-introductory-machine-learning)! I don't care about machine learning in the slightest, but I'm still really glad I took this class. There was a lot of time spent on the theory behind machine learning, which turned out to be very interesting.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently preparing my Calttech application, I'd love to know if the school offers a major in particular (other than CS! Not because I dislike coding, but because of competition) that would be particularly suitable for a career in quant finance (and the tech industry as a backup, SWE or managerial positions). I'd like a STEM undergrad, am planning to go to grad school, am good at math. ECs/student profile are also STEM oriented.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S. Any CS + X or interdisciplinary majors?",

            "comment": "Lately ACM has been the hot choice for getting into quant finance. Ma, IDS, CS or combos are also common. \n\nIt also depends which part of quant finance. The dev side of things wants CS skills, the trading side of things wants quick quantitative skills, the research side of things wants ma/ph/cs research skills. \n\nHonestly if you already know you want to be a quant (or SWE) you may as well go to more industry oriented colleges (as opposed to Caltech). The whole point of going to Caltech is you get access to a fantastic STEM research community...you're not going to be making the most of a Caltech education if you're just down a straightforward quant path...",

The CMS department website should have more information. \n\nAnd many people get a business/economics second major because it\u2019s pretty easy to use your humanities/social sciences credits to get it, especially in CMS. \n\nGood luck!",

I am currently an undergraduate university student in Canada studying Geomatics.\n\nI have a ton of questions to ask, so if someone can PM me to answer them, that would be very much appreciated!\n\nIt would be a bonus if you were also from Canada and in the division listed in the title, but all advice is welcome.\n\nThank you!",

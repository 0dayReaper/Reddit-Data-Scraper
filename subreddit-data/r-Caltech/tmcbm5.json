            "comment": "As someone who did both, they're ... not really comparable.\n\nLike, the *physics* you learn in AP Phys C E&amp;M is decently comparable to the electricity and magnetism parts of Ph1. But Ph1 will also have:\n\n* a lot more special relativity, at a level you will not have encountered in AP, including how the E and B fields transform with reference frames\n* a lot more work requiring multivar calc -- a lot of divs/grads/curls\n* Some diffeqs\n\nThat said, you might want to try to skip Ph1a. You can take the placement exam in the summer before. If you don't pass the placement exam (= don't get to skip Ph1a), don't sweat it, most physics majors (including those who go on to good PhD programs) take Ph1a too, so you're not behind or anything. :)",

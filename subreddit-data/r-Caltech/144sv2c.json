I'm curious about the difficulty level of the test and whether there are any additional resources or tips beyond the books and materials mentioned by \\[Caltech\\]([https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/documents/4722/Transfer\\_Entrance\\_Examinations\\_Book\\_List.pdf](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/documents/4722/Transfer_Entrance_Examinations_Book_List.pdf))Moreover, as an international resident, I'm wondering if it's possible to take the test remotely. If so, I'd love to hear from individuals who have already gone through the process and how they managed to take the test themselves.Your insights and experiences would be greatly appreciated! Please share any information or advice you may have regarding the difficulty of the Caltech transfer admissions test and the process of taking it, especially for international students.",

            "comment": "Based on this website, it looks like being remote and doing it electronically is no issue perhaps? I'm afraid I don't have direct experience with the test though.\n\nhttps://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/transfer-applicants/entrance-examinations-and-academic-prep\n\nGood luck! Expect proof based questions relating to calculus especially, as our first calculus course is essentially a \"let's use calculus as a bludgeon to teach proofs with\". Be confident with proofs by induction, contradiction, etc. Be prepared for infinite series and related topics as well. All of these came up heavily when I placed out of math 1A, and infinite series/proofs are relevant to more than just 1A. Review any random variable stuff you might not remember too, like how if two variables are independent, their sum's variance is equal to the sum of the variances (I think? It's been like six years lol). Also be prepared for an analysis of random variables from a calculus/integration-based perspective. All our stats classes bully people with integrals, so you'll definitely want to have memorized core integration rules.\n\nIf you can't remember something on the test that is core to your proof, like the integral of arctangent for example (literally have no idea how to integrate that thing anymore), be forthcoming in the exam and proceed with a rigorous proof otherwise as much as possible. They will definitely give you mostly full credit if your proof is solid except for a memorization-based fact.\n\nBe prepared for proofs with matrices and vectors as well. Remember what you can do with matrices algebraically speaking in the context of an equation. This is very likely to be relevant for any matrix-based proofs.\n\nI'm afraid I can't give much insight for physics as I barely knew what was going on at the time, but expect integrals there too!\n\nIf you want good practice for probability, try AIME probability questions that are questions 1-5 (test is harder the later the question is so a probability-based #15 question will be too hard to be relevant probably). These questions won't involve calculus so also look up integration-based probability theorems too.",

I got rejected from a lot of schools that are easier to get into and got Caltech by luck relative to the others.",

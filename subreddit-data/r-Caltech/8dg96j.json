    "postText": "Hi everyone! I've been accepted to the Caltech SURF program and will be working at JPL for the summer. I am coming from Florida and my home institution lets out for summer in May and starts back earlier as a result. I will be starting June 11th (a week early) instead as not to miss classes. I wanted to know if there are any fellow SURF students out there in the same situation that would be willing to stay together either for the full summer or to split an air bnb for a week before the dorms open up? I have already applied for housing but this was as a backup precaution. Even if you're not wanting to find housing, I would love to talk to fellow SURF students or other students that will be near campus over the summer! \n\nEDIT: I have worked something out for housing but if you're doing SURF feel free to still message me!",

I've tried to get into SURF housing but as my application was late all of the places have been taken up. Any chance we could PM to talk about housing etc? or even just to talk about projects! Would love to hear from someone else on the program",

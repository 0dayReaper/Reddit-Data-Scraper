    "postText": "(first of all why is this happening during midterms?)\n\nDo people have more information on what these amendments are about or what the reasoning is for them? (link to text and voting is in an email from the revcomm chair, I don't want to post it here bc non-Caltech people)\n\nI am very opposed to Amendment 4 at least, it basically abolishes dues and forces ASCIT to have to negotiate for funding every year. It means Caltech could raise funding or threaten to lower it and might use that power to try to coerce ASCIT or even the IHC chair to keep quiet about other stuff. Even though the Tech is financed at 10% of dues, because the overall amount is controlled by Caltech, they could threaten to cut funding if the Tech publishes stuff they don't like. It seems very similar to the amendment that was rejected in 2020 over similar concerns.\n\nAmendment 5 seems pretty fair, I think it's fine to not allow people to ask for yearbook refunds when money has already been spent on ordering books.\n\nAmendment 1 seems good and probably overdue.\n\nAmendment 2 seems fine.\n\nI have absolutely no idea what Amendment 3 does. \" Clarify that the period between the election of new Officers and installation of new Officers must be used to help transition the new Officers. \"....like what was happening during that time before???\n\nAmendment 6 sounds good at face value, but again, what was happening in the past? Were officers being paid? Is there some reason this needs to be included? I'm so confused.\n\nI'm also mildly suspicious of some of these because the minutes said that some of them were suggested by administrators.",

But I do agree that this is part of a worrying trend of student government losing power. Sad since strong student government and autonomy used to be one of Caltech's defining attributes.",

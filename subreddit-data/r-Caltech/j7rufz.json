Many people I knew did some sort of academic summer thing at some point in high school, but not necessarily research. I guess it also depends on your field of interest, like prospective math majors would be a lot more likely to go to a mathcamp than try to do research, since it's already plenty hard just to find an appropriate math research problem for undergrads let alone high school.",

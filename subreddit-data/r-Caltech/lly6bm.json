    "postText": "Hey y'all,\n\nI was admitted to Caltech EA back in December and I have a few open-ended questions. I was looking into the research and extracurricular activities Caltech has to offer, and was wondering what y'all have done or currently do to maximize your experience at Caltech? What advice would you give to an incoming Caltech frosh that you wish you had coming into Caltech? Also, I'm interested in majoring in either mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, or computer science. Any insights regarding these majors? Lastly, how's the work-life balance at Caltech? I've heard that the classes are super rigorous, and was curious as to whether that plays a role in your overall happiness.\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer these questions, have a great day.",

            "comment": "Hey there! I\u2019m a frosh myself, so I can\u2019t answer your questions about major, but I can give a shot at the others!\n\nThe best way I\u2019ve found to maximize my experience so far is just interacting with the people here. Everyone here is really friendly, and you\u2019re more likely than not to find someone who\u2019s passionate about the same things you are.  Making those connections early, to me, has meant that I\u2019ve had friends that I can lean on and support through one of the toughest years of our lives. You\u2019re certainly right about the famed rigorous workload, but having a few friends that you can lean on always makes it better. We\u2019re all in this together, and ultimately everyone here wants you to succeed and have a good time. \n\nThere are few really great ways to get to know people here! When I first was accepted, I did the discord server thing and got to know people in my class before the academic year even started. We hung out a lot during summer break, which made it infinitely more enjoyable. Once the academic year starts, there\u2019ll be the club fair, which I highly recommend going to. Clubs range from STEM-focused (such as rocketry or robotics) to culturally focused (I\u2019m a member of CLASES, Caltech\u2019s Latinx association!) to just for fun! You can try whatever you want, no judgement involved. I spent so much of my high school career on my robotics teams that I never got to explore more artistic interests, so come the club fair I signed up for guitar, glee, AND ballroom dance. I didn\u2019t continue with all of those, but it made me SO happy to be able to just try them and get to talk with the people in those clubs. Joining STEM-focused clubs is also a great way to talk to upperclassmen. I\u2019ve found that they typically have things more figured out about their lives than I do. Being able to talk to them about their experiences at Caltech, especially if they\u2019re interested in areas of study that you are, is a really good way to learn more about majors and figure out what you want to pursue. \n\nI also had a lot of fun with rotation this year, and I\u2019d highly suggest participating in at least one of the events when it rolls around for you, even if you don\u2019t think you want to participate in Caltech\u2019s housing system. I liked going to events because I got to learn more about the history of Caltech (the type you can\u2019t find on the Wikipedia page), meet more people here, and really learn what \u201cCaltech culture\u201d is. I ended up rotating into a house, and going to house events and being able to talk to fellow house members really keeps me going through the day. They\u2019re wonderful :)\n\nBesides all of this, take advantage of the resources that Caltech provides. Go to office hours for your classes, go to pop-up lectures (I actually registered for one on the Perseverance rover which is happening tonight!), and apply to SURFs. These are all great ways to get more in-depth knowledge on material you\u2019re studying, or learn something completely new. Special note on SURFs, start applying to them early. Like, December-early. I waited until way too late to start looking, which really put a lot of unnecessary stress on me. Plus, a lot of really cool opportunities on the \u201cAnnouncements of Opportunity\u201d page close for application before January. \n\nAlso, I woke up this morning looking to give an incoming frosh this piece of advice: for the love of everything that is good, study matrices over the summer. Do all of Khan Academy\u2019s section on linear algebra. You\u2019ll thank me second term of your first year. \n\nWelcome to Caltech! Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions! :)",

            "comment": "Wanting to take advantage is half the battle.  There will be ample opportunities to get involved in a ton of stuff, so just getting out there and trying things out is your best bet.\n\nGet involved with research early - apply for a SURF.  Meet with profs and grad turkeys.  Use office hours!\n\nThere's quite a bit of difference between those majors.  Honestly, it's okay not knowing which way you want to go when you start out.  You'll figure things out some time during that first year.  Or, you'll have to anyway.\n\nWork-life balance is what you make of it.  It also depends on the major.  EE is the hardest out of those you selected, but it is not unusual to be pulling overnighters in any major. Again though - wanting to use the resources available is half of it.  \n\nYou'll be in study groups with your friends, and take advantage of any counseling services you might want.",

            "comment": "Hey there. \n\nFirst of all, congrats on your admission. I\u2019d say the best way to make the greatest use of your time at Caltech, from what I\u2019ve seen so far is to be as open minded as possible. \n\nThere\u2019s so much you don\u2019t know about and so much going on and the things you get to hear and be a part of are downright insane. Go sign up for the guest lecture series that really interest you. Make friends across all majors and take a few classes if possible to sample other departments. I\u2019d also really recommend just reaching out to whoever you want with questions. As another reply said here, apply for SURFs or exchange programs if you like that. Take pizza classes across lots of areas to just hear about really different research.\n\nOne thing I definitely regret was not signup for clubs frosh year. I did not think I\u2019d have the time to commit while living in an international time zone. The work that clubs do like the AIAA club is downright amazing. \n\nIn terms of the classes...caltech is hard. There\u2019s no denying that. Classes like Ma1a are really challenging for almost everyone and that trend definitely continues. While some people may initially fare better based on their high school background, everyone is going to struggle. But I guess there\u2019s some saying about friendship forged in fire being strong or whatever but the bonds you make while grinding a set are going to be invaluable. Sets do take a lot of time depending on the class. As you get more familiar with the system you can definitely schedule classes to minimize your hours and you\u2019ll become accustomed to a personal way to get stuff done. Find friends and groups to work with and you\u2019ll have a great time. \n\nOther than that, as an admit I\u2019d advise you to enjoy your summer break. Get to know your classmates. Slowly get in touch with upperclassmen. I wish I spoke to more upperclassmen but I\u2019m shy so let\u2019s gloss over that. \n\nIf you come to caltech, you\u2019re in for an interesting time. Feel free to get in touch :).\n\nCheers",

(Raccoons and possums may join your nighttime wanderings.)\n\nBut even within STEM-ish activities, there is a lot you can do outside your classes. Even if it's not needed for any class, learn 3D printing; go paint some t-shirts; figure out how you're going to make the Best Ditch Day stack and squirrel away supplies for years.",

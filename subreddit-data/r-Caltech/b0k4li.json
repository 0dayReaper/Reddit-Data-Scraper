            "comment": "On average a student will take 1 class a term with required attendance (humanities), and 3-4 other classes of varying formats: Lab classes you have to always attend, group discussion classes you generally need to attend for credit, and lectures. Field trip classes where you definitely have to go on the trip also exist in at least one department.\n\nI'm guessing your question was mostly about lectures. The average 9 unit class will have 3 hours of lecture a week, and 6 hours of homework. The amount that the prof cares if you show up is roughly inversely proportional to the number of enrolled students. This means that skipping lecture is easiest freshman year and gets harder as you get into your major. The more students there are the easier it is to get notes from someone else as well (depending on that class's collaboration policy).\n\nIf you do skip, you will likely have to spend your own time learning that material if you want to be able to do well on sets and exams. If the lecturer is bad at covering material, this may take you less than 3 hours a week. If the lecturer is good, it could take more. If you're a particularly efficiency-minded and masochistic individual as many students here are, you can roll this time into your 6 hour problem set for a 7-9 hour miserable experience once a week. This is also known as \"ACM95\" (just kidding, that's actually a 15 hour weekly experience)\n\nIf your goal is to never go to lectures, this may be the wrong school. It's definitely a viable strategy frosh year, but after that you will probably need someone's help to understand the material well enough to get an A. If you put time into this on your own and work with people, great! The collaboration here will work wonderfully for you. But if you're not going to lectures and not studying the material until the night before a set is due, you're going to need help. And as your classes get smaller, the number of people willing to help with this who aren't paid to do so (profs, TAs, tutors) will also get smaller just because there are fewer people in your classes, and people here are smart enough to know if they're carrying you through a class. Some people are happy to do this, but probably not for an entire degree's worth of classes\n",

Most lecture classes don't grade attendance, so whether you go is a matter of whether you'll get more out of spending that time in class or going over the material on your own.  Often with a large class and a bad lecturer, the second option is better.  For instance, I spent a total of 20 minutes in Ma2 before concluding the textbook would convey the exact same information in half the time.  On the other hand, there are non-mandatory attendance classes that I've gone to every lecture of, because the lectures were interesting or helpful and included content I couldn't have just read on my own.  I think the high rate of class skipping at Caltech is mostly a result of the teaching quality and a very utility-maximizing student body.",

However, I think the Mechanical Engineering degree is one of the most practical majors at Caltech. For instance, there are classes where you build robots.\n\nEvery Caltech grad I know now I would hire. The important thing undergrads take away are general problem solving skills rather than specific formulas. Caltech puts heavy emphasis on giving problems that require a deep understanding and ingenuity, whereas other courses I've seen tend to give more problems that are smaller in scope and designed to practice a specific concept.",

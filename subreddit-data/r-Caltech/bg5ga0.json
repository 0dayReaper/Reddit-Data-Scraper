    "postText": "First, Caltech is a special place. But, It is not suited for every admitted student. Admissions does a good job. But, they are not perfect. \n\nIt is a perfect fit for some students but absolute torture for many.  \n\nDo not expect a typical undergraduate experience. \n\nCommit to Caltech if you enjoy real hard work, if Science and Research brings you pure joy, if you do not need typical college social life.\n\nDo not commit to Caltech if you are not willing or cannot do real hard work, if you are a brand name chaser, if you have any signs of mental health issues. \n\nCaltech is well known only in Science and Research communities.  Do not get offended if general public/friends/relatives do not recognize it but your third cousin and your high school buddy gets pat in the back when they mention their average school. \n\nDo not think of transferring after freshman year if you do not like it. It is not going to happen in almost all the cases.\n\nWhen they say it is a hard school, better believe it. \n\nIf you hear: Pick 2 of the 3: Grades, Sleep or Social life.  Take it seriously.",

I don't think \"any signs of mental health issues\" should get you scared, but you should really critically think if you're interested in pushing yourself harder than your peers (who are pushing themselves pretty hard).\n\nOther than that though, I largely agree with this sentiment: Caltech is hard and you will hit your max. That's not always fun.",

I was never genuinely interested in science and research. I was good at rote learning but not at real hard work. Even though my math and science scores (including AP Calculus BC and AP Physics) were as high as everything else, math concepts were relatively harder for me.\n\nNot only was Caltech extremely stressful and a cause of burnout, I didn't get that much out of it, and my career hasn't turned out great.",

As a graduate student with mental health issues, I can definitely say there are things about Caltech that I think exacerbate existing problems. But I'm not sure if it's reasonable to say it's unique to Caltech, or something I would have experienced at any other top-tier school.\n\nIf someone got into Caltech, Harvey Mudd, or Princeton, would any of these be meaningfully better or worse than others, in terms of climate for mental health? What about large research institutions, like Berkeley or Michigan? To what extent is there a tradeoff between being lost in a sea of students, versus being isolated in an environment with unrealistic pressures?",

They, typically, do not have much life experience whereas many graduates are likely to be more  mature and better equipped to deal with issues.\n\nPerhaps, they will have similar issues, maybe, to a lesser extent in other top tier schools reputed to be intense.\n\nSpeaking of larger research publics. They may offer more privacy, diversity but in a small school, you do not have much privacy. That adds to the stress. Do not underestimate the sting of stigma which could manifest in increasing isolation. The course load and sets require collaboration.  I think you can get by 4 courses per semester in most of the top tiers. Consider 5 courses (many being under united) per quarter. There are certain things that are unique to Caltech that can overwhelm many who have to deal with mental health issues.\n\nIs it not fair to say that they may have better shot at success and long term happiness at less intense and little more relaxed environments?",

There's lots of mental health issues (OCD for example) that aren't going to ruin your experience, and even things like depression/anxiety/etc can be coped with (source: I did, and I think Caltech was 100000% the correct place for me to go). Rather what I'd say is, \"don't expect an environment that gives you the latitude you need to work through mental health issues\" - it is true that for the most part you absolutely will not be able to take time off to deal with things like that.",

I go to Minnesota for undergrad and was genuinely surprised when a friend didn't know about Caltech. On the other hand, I do remember this one guy from Florida mentioning how Minnesota was a \"top-tier\" school (albeit he was a chemical engineer).",

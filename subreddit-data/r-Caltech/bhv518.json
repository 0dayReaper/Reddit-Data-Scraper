You need 486 units to graduate, so if your major doesn't already require more than 486 units then you can average 40.5 units/term for 12 terms. That is 4 full classes (usually 3 science/math classes and 1 humanities class) and 3-6 units of other (lab, PE, etc). Some majors simply require you to take more than that. For example, engineers don't have nearly as much flexibility in their class scheduling than a chemist. \n\nI know many people that did 45-50 units every term and finished with ~550 units, but ultimately I found I was best near 42 units. So the answer is, you'll have to figure it out. That's what the first two terms on P/F are for.",

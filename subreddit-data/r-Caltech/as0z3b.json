    "postText": "I have been researching good engineering schools and CalTech has popped up quite a bit. I do like the student to faculty ratio, I also like that CalTech has a good reputation in the industry.\n\nHowever, I did quickly note that it is extremely difficult to get into the school, especially as a transfer. I would like to know what I can do to help my chances of getting in. My background is that I'm planning to earn my AA degree with a focus on math and I'll strengthen my math skills outside of class. I am currently a high school senior so I can't really do much except sign up for math boot camps at the CC I'm going to. Any advice is appreciated, be it habits I would need to build, classes, etc.\n\n**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**\n\n**I am from out of state**\n\n**I do have weak math skills, but I would love to be an engineer**\n\n**Am considering mechanical engineering or electrical (quite different I know)**",

The teaching is atrocious here.\n\nSecond, most undergrads enter with near perfect math scores on the standardized tests. If I remember correctly the average was missing one or two questions.\n\n",

And thank you for the comment on the math, I now have a better understanding of what I need to do to improve. Even if I don't get in, the math might still be useful for me in the field.",

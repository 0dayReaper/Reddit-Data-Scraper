Would I be able to survive with a decent GPA that would get me into a good grad school? On average, how much work (how many hours) can I expect to put in every day? Also, does anyone have any suggestions on how I can prepare myself before the fall or any advice in general? Thank you!",

Worst case scenario, if you don't get into a grad school that you want, you should be able to easily get a good industry job with a Caltech degree.\n\nI didn't even major in CS and basically only took CS1 before my junior year and I've found CS industry jobs easier to come by than I expected - so you have a good industry safety net :)\n\nI had no CS experience before Caltech at all, feel free to PM me with more questions",

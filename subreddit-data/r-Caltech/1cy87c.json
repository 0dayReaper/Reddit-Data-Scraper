I'm a reed musician and I'd be really interested in getting involved with some musical productions and playing in a pit orchestra.",

The two groups collaborate quite a bit(participation overlap is probably above 80%) and they've been trying to do a musical every 1-2 years(with performance space and musician scheduling as common confounds.)\n\nIt's a good group, and there are active grad students who could talk to you about balancing research workloads and show commitments.",

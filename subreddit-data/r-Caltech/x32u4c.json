    "postText": "Good day! \n\nI'm applying to Caltech (considering ED'ing) and there were some things I wanted to hear from current  students. What do you say are the pros and cons of life at Caltech? I've heard that the academics are insanely hard and there is no greek life, but there are houses. What else? I heard that I think you used to be able to have cats in dorms. I was super excited when I heard that, but is it still possible? Because the website says no pets and I'm confused.\n\nThank you! \\^\\^",

As of recently, some pets were allowed in some locations.\n\nIf you apply and are accepted, please, please attend the on campus event in the spring. Not sure what it's called now. Caltech is not for everyone, not only because the academics are difficult but because the culture isn't always a good fit.",

I'm an international student so attending the event might be hard, but the fact that pets were allowed in some places makes me really happy! \n\nYeah, I'm trying to get a feel for the culture before going in, so I don't end up at somewhere I don't want to be. :/ Caltech seems like a one of my dream schools for now but we'll see how it turns out. That's why I've been trying to reach out to students!",

It's because its the only part of Caltech that won't anger, sadden, or outright make you feel awful about it. The houses are great and rotation is the way people can choose/get fit into their house but the current administration is trying to remove the houses and their culture in its entirety (so they can replace it with unoriginal Bechetel-esque housing space). Additionally, you animal must be an ESA to be able to live with you in the dorms, yes, but the hoops that you have to jump through to get it registered with Caltech and the inane about of paperwork and nonsense you have to deal with is so ridiculous. As a current student please please consider your options wisely especially if you end up choosing to go to Caltech.",

I'm an intern at JPL this summer and am looking for cheap housing.\n\nAlso, if you are a female student and have space on the floor, I will pay to sleep on your floor in a sleeping bag. Seriously. \n\nI live in LA, but 40 miles from JPL. It's a long commute I don't want to have to make everyday, but money is super tight. Thanks!",

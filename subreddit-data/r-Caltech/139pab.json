LACBC is offering $20 for a set of front and rear bike lights (Rear lights required by law in city of Pasadena, Front lights in other parts of LA. Really, you need both) So if you're riding around at night, gift yourself these lights! Proceeds go to supporting LACBC's Operation Firefly http://www.la-bike.org/projects/operation-firefly",

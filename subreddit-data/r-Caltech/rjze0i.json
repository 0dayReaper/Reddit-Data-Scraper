    "postText": "I got accepted into Caltech yesterday and I'm 99% sure I'm going there in the fall. Could anyone answer a few questions that I have?\n\n1. I'm planning on majoring in CS and I'm very set on pursuing SWE. I know Caltech heavily emphasizes research, but I did some research over the summer and I had mixed feelings toward it (of course high school research doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of undergrad research). Will I be left out if I don't focus on research? I'm going to give it another try but I was wondering what it would be like if I don't like it.\n2. How can I prepare myself? Impostor syndrome is creeping in already and I know the curriculum is no joke. CS is my strength but I'm not brilliant, I'm alright at math and physics, and I struggle a bit with chem and bio. Are there any textbooks or resources that I can use to make the transition a bit easier?\n3. Any other general advice?\n\nAnyways, I'm really excited. :) Go Beavers!",

It's not so different from memorizing multiplication tables when you were in elementary school. It's not strictly necessary, but familiarity and ease with those mathematical tools makes the classes so much more interesting and engaging, because you can actually focus on the underlying concepts being taught without having to struggle with the basic math.\n\nIf I were to do it over again, I'd tell myself to study for and take the BC calc exam like my friends. Or at least work through some sort of Kumon-style workbook of integrals, maybe even diff eqs.",

            "comment": "- Absolutely not, a good chunk of CS majors don\u2019t even touch research work and go straight towards industry (internships etc). There\u2019s also work you can do in the CS department over the summer or during the year that\u2019s sort of halfway between research and internship work which might be a good fit too. \n\n- I wouldn\u2019t worry right now about preparation. There\u2019s still quite a bit of time until you\u2019d have to do any of that kind of work. If anything, going back over any work you did in high school might be best. There\u2019s also going to be plenty of help with the materials when you\u2019re taking the courses. \n\n- Join the admitted students discord. Try to get advice from upperclassmen for your pressing questions. The frosh (and other prefrosh) might do okay answering your questions, but the frosh have been here taking classes for literally 11 weeks at this point, so they might not be the most informed about every single aspect of Caltech life (even though they might sound like it).

I passed the class this past quarter with out an issue (remember, your on pass fail the first two semesters, use that to your advantage to find out your own schedule/balance of school and life ((pass fail mentality baby)) ). \n\nThe passing grade for math 1A this past quarter? 28%. It\u2019s more than doable for almost everyone (imo), especially if you collaborate and work with others. That\u2019s where I got some of the most useful information as well (and there\u2019s always extra help available from recitations, office hours, and Dean\u2019s tutors that you should definitely take advantage of. They can really make your life easier). \n\nNow, I personally didn\u2019t study for my placement tests because they are supposed to place you at the level your currently at right? Up to you in the end though.\n\nFinally, Caltech wouldn\u2019t have let you in if they didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to survive and thrive here. They saw in your application someone who has the prerequisites to be able to succeed. Take heart in that. \n\nOther than that I look forward to welcoming you as a fellow Beaver!",

            "comment": "BS 01 here. Learning more math will not help your imposter syndrome. Learn about shame and how it can manifest as workaholism. Caltech will drive a person insane. The culture normalizes nay glorifies pursuit of achievement at all cost. Fortify your mental health. It\u2019s a great school to have on your resume but sweet Jesus be careful and prioritize your mental health. I\u2019ve only realized in the last five years that it\u2019s not worth killing myself (figuratively) to get that A. My freshman year roommate didn\u2019t get that opportunity because he killed himself literally. One of my other close friends from tech went the same way a year later. Not to freak you out but know that you\u2019re getting into some serious shit there. Edit: Other advice is to take up surfing. Get to the ocean.",

            "comment": "1. I\u2019m a second year undergrad at Caltech. I\u2019d say research is really common here because it\u2019s pretty easy to get. Especially for the summer, Caltechs SURF program is really easy to do because it\u2019s just a quick application and a couple of letters of rec iirc. Every student here is practically guaranteed it. I also do know quite a few students who focus more on industry. Also it is pretty common for CS majors here to do internships over the summer. A lot of kids my year are doing internships at Meta, Amazon, etc\n\n2. I\u2019d say it\u2019s really hard to prepare for Caltech. For me, Caltech\u2019s work and workload were somethings that I completely did not expect. You have the first two terms as pass fail to adjust, so use those to prepare for the rest of the terms. I\u2019d say take a break now and pursue other interests because once Caltech starts you won\u2019t have much time to do anything other than school work.",

I had good Calc and Chemistry in HS and I did fine in those. I had a really really bad Physics class (teacher's main job was coaching football -- we mostly made physics themed bumper stickers) and all I can say is thank god for frosh pass-fail.\n\nImpostor syndrome is the pits. You are not alone. I've been a tenured professor for 20 years and still feel it sometimes. Admissions knows what they are doing. You deserve to be there. Don't lose sight of that.\n\nHigh school research might not be the best intro to research, but at least when I went there many, many people did not go into research. \n\n\\&gt; 3. Any other general advice?\n\nGo to Tommy's for burgers as soon as possible.",

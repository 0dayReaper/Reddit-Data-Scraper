It was a nice chance to network and learn business related skills as well. And free food! https://ctme.caltech.edu/",

On the other hand, I would bet that a good chunk of people go from working at bigger tech companies to potentially doing more startup work or taking on management roles over time, which could then lead to more business management focused roles which would benefit from an MBA, but that\u2019s a 7-15 timeline (very speculatively).",

How often do people usually wash their clothes at Caltech/ will it be a huge hassle to get laundry done with the amount of machines? Thank you",

I usually do laundry every other week, and it\u2019s never been a hassle for me. I have very occasionally heard complaints about people not taking their stuff out of driers, but they\u2019re rare.",

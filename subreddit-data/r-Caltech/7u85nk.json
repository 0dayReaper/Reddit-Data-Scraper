I don't think any school can teach engineering. \n\nIt's a misconception for students to attend lectures, do homework, and all of a sudden master engineering. \n\nThat's why Harvey Mudd, Stanford, MIT, NYU, Harvard, and Caltech should all focus on projects, rather than push things off to capstone projects at the end of senior year. \n\nAlso congrats on the $75k. I barely have a stable job now :( ",

Some majors at Caltech require or can include a senior thesis, but my engineering degree did not require senior capstone projects or theses. However, I did projects throughout my time at Caltech. The major projects were in the spring quarter to finish off a a series of two or three-class series.\n\n$75k is actually significantly less than what people with similar backgrounds as me usually make. \n\nWhat did you study, and what do you do now?

Most bio majors just stop at calc 2 and physics 2. But I wanted to do more engineering and math classes (thermo, pchem, etc). I haven\u2019t taken transport or kinetics. \n\n\nRight now, I\u2019m thinking about a masters to supplement or compensate for my 3.2 gpa :( \n\nMy ultimate goal is a PhD. \n\nAs for job wise, I don\u2019t have any. My GPA is too low compared to the bio majors who only took biology classes and have a 3.8 GPA. \n\nBut I have more research experience than they do. But apparently lab tech jobs and research assistant jobs look more at GPA than research experience. ",

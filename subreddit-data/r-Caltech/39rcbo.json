    "postText": "Hi, I'm trying to compile information on the amount of Humanities/Social Sciences/Writing requirements in top Universities around the world. I've been looking at Caltech's website, and have thus far been able to ascertain that you're required to take 108 units of Humanities classes. What I haven't been able to find is what the total number of units an undergraduate needs in order to graduate. Could anyone here point me to a source where I might find that information? \n\nThanks!",

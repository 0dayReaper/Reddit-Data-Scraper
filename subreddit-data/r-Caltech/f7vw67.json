    "postText": "The deadline to apply is today and I have worked with my mentor to finish my proposal and submit my application. However, I have currently only received one letter of recommendation out of the three I requested from my professors. Since the deadline is today, I do not believe my other letters of recommendation will come in time. Does anyone have any knowledge of what happens if I don\u2019t have all the letters of recommendation? How much does it reduce my chances of getting into the SURF program?",

    "postText": "Hello, just wondering if anyone on here has done the 2 years at Caltech after being at a partner liberal arts college for 3 years to receive two degrees total. \nIf so, could you share your experience transitioning between the schools, the difficulty of the curriculum, the application difficulty/process, if you recommend the program, or anything else?\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Since no one has answered I'll chime in. \n\nI was not a 3/2 student but I lived off campus with 3 of them: One from Oberlin, one from Glendale Community College and one from Occidental. 2 EE majors and 1 MechE. \n\nAll 3 of them did well (I think they were all above average at Caltech) and I am confident they would recommend it. \n\nI cannot comment on the difficulty of the application process but I suspect it's quite challenging/selective; it sounded like they had been \"bored\" with college up until that point and knowing their work ethics it was obvious you only got in as a transfer if you were ready for it. \n\nThe classes at Caltech can be rough but generally the atmosphere is highly collaborative and you can learn a ton from your peers. One thing that transfer students do miss out on is the freshman bonding experiences, both social and core classes. If you do transfer you probably want to go a bit out of your way to find friends because they make all the difference. The people are generally welcoming of transfers but the culture difference sounded significant for all 3 of my roommates. Only one of them engaged strongly with the dorm system but the other 2 found people to work with as well. \n\nSorry you haven't received a reply from the real deal but when I was there, maybe 2-5 transfer students per year were admitted? I suspect there aren't more than a few hundred in total so you might have a hard time finding someone. \n\nGood luck!",

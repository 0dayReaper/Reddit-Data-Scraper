I guess what I meant is that if you're the type of person to come to caltech knowing what it entailed (it's a math/sci school full of smart people), you probably are a high achiever in high school and would want to go to a school where people are of a similar caliber. I guess if that's not the case then yes, there are many places you'd be happy. But if you're aiming for a school that most people of your caliber are aiming for, then I'd assume you'd want something Ivy League or something, but I'm just saying the things you hate about caltech are also present in those schools. (At least points #1 and #2, probably #3  and #4 as well). \n\nI don't think it's fair to generalize your experience and say that \"caltech sucks huge hairy balls\" just because you didn't have a good time here. Your complaints will be evident at a lot of \"good schools\" so perhaps they all \"suck huge hairy balls\" and everyone should go to their local state school. Otherwise, maybe you're just not meant for this type of college environment?\n\nAs far as social circles, I think it does depend a lot on which house you're in. I suppose I could hate it here as well if I was in certain houses, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt of hating it. I just don't think it's fair to say that ALL of Caltech sucks for those reasons",

That claim's kind of inaccurate, and maybe even condescending in certain contexts. In general, nothing is really meant to be one way or the other. It's foolish to take the world as it is, not question it or criticize it, and just say it's meant to be this way. I'm actually glad I went through some of the more difficult academic experiences Caltech has to offer, like problem sets and such. But why am I suddenly not allowed to be critical of other aspects of higher education? Why do you instantly label me as \"the type of person that would be unhappy everywhere?\" People don't have to go around being happy and saying \"lol\" and \"lmao\" all the time. People should be allowed to express their opinions and be critical. It's a very natural thing. ",

I wanted to be in X house, (won't say bc of rotation rules, but those rules are stupid), but instead got out into Y house. Y house is full of nice people but the reality is that they are not my people at all and I will never be like them. If I had been in X house I would have been WAYYYYY more involved in the housing system, but In Y house everyone thinks I'm a loser so it's better just to live off campus and not live with them. The houses aren't equal at all in terms of the way they act with admin and the special privileges some get, but I can live with their being favorites. What I can't live with is having a difficult time making friends bc the people in X house who I feel I would click with better didn't pick me in rotation. Plus the whole tribe mentality of the housing system sucks bc now an entire house hates me for no reason. \n\nAlso I see u r in Avery, which means u will have a much different view on the house system than the other 7 houses.\n\nWho knows, maybe I'm just a nerd who somehow got into this school who isn't really likeable. But I have some amazing friends I would trust my life with back home. Honestly I blame my awful grades to my awful social life to the housing system. \n\nSo yes caltech does sucks huge hairy balls. 95% of the people here hate it. If anything more people are going to like it on this sub then the actual population bc self selecting bias of being on this sub blah blah blah. \n\n",

I don't think you're unlikeable and I feel like perhaps you managed to slip through the cracks and felt left behind if you feel that way. I'm sorry that happened to you, and I do think that you can find your niche here, despite how hard it seems. Feel free to pm me as well if you want to talk.",

Listen buddy, it doesn't matter whether or not you meet some arbitrary standard of \"likability\" if *you* don't want it to matter. Being a Caltech student, it probably *actually* doesn't matter as employers and grad admissions won't give a shit. There's only a certain lower bound of social skills you need to succeed in the \"real world\" anyway, and in order to be a functional human being. Beyond that you get diminishing marginal returns. But since you say you have amazing friends back home it doesn't seem like you have that problem anyway. \n\nBut still, it's not healthy to think of yourself as within the \"unlikeable nerd\" archetype. Have some fucking self-respect. Try not to let your circumstances influence your grades and your overall well-being. If you ever want to talk, just send me a pm",

Caltech is bad because everyone confuses it for Cal Poly regardless of its high ranking? Well, UIUC's ranking to obscurity ratio is even higher. Yes, even among STEM people.\n\n2. Caltech is bad because the students are assholes? Well come to UIUC then, you'll just bump into the exact same assholes. Except this time, they're more retarded by a significant margin.\n\n3. Caltech professors are bad because they only care about their research? Well that describes literally every research university ever, dumbass. The only difference is that at least Caltech's research is probably good.\n\nIf anyone disputes any one of these points, then transfer out to some random place like UIUC then. \n\nOh wait, you won't.\n\nEdit: To the downvoters, keep downvoting instead of coming up with a rebuttal.

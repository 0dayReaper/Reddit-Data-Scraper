            "comment": "Caltech students can currently study abroad at Cambridge, Edinburgh, and UCL, among other non-UK schools. I'm not sure if the programs are reciprocal. The program already existed when I was a student, but I don't recall meeting any British exchange students. Maybe they knew better than to come to Caltech? \n\nCaltech students are geeky and kind of quirky. Social life tends to center around the student houses and often involves working together on problem sets. Caltech is not a party school, but a couple times a year, each house will throw a big party featuring elaborate construction. \n\nA car would be useful to get around off-campus. Many Caltech students don't have cars but will find friends who do. Public transit options in Pasadena and Los Angeles are very limited compared to London, but a system does exist. You can get to downtown LA, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and Universal Studios fairly easily by rail. \n\nYou'll find a plethora of Asian restaurants close to Caltech -- not so much in Pasadena, but 10-20 minutes way by car.\n\n",

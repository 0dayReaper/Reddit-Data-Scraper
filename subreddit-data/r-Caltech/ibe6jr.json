    "postText": "Hello I am a student (pre college) in Europe and I am very interested in Theorethical Physics. I am very excited on studying it in college and Caltech is my first choice. I have researched it a lot but the only doubt I still have is about the financial aid. I am not poor but the prices for tuition are very high in this institution. The marked financial aid for my parents revenue isn't enough because there are much more factors besides revenue that I can't count because I can't do the \"test\" in the Caltech website to figure out the aid that I would actually get because I don't live in the US, thus can't fill in certain obligatory questions. I belive that eventually I can find out better when I apply but for now there isn't much that I can do. Can anyone please help?",

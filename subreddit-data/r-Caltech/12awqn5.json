    "postText": "Hello Techers,\n\nI wanted to go to Caltech really much, but was rejected last month, for reason, I suspect, of stupid application. At the same time I applied to Harvard as a joke (never really was excited about it), and got in. Having heard and studied a lot of Caltech's culture, traditions, people, I felt that this place would be like second home to me. Is it worth, in your opinion to take a gap year and reapply, or should I just accept Harvard's offer and don't bother? I want to hear opinions of people who are already here and probably have more realistic attitude towards this question. Thank you.",

There\u2019s no point trying to apply a second time for something you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll get and lose a year anyways. College is what you make of it and I\u2019d be thoroughly surprised if you couldn\u2019t find a caltech like microcosm within Harvard.",

I know I wouldn't have the personal discipline to take a gap year and keep up to date on my studies, but maybe you do.\n\nI had a friend who took 2 years off after his freshman year at Caltech for his Mormon mission.  He was never able to get back into it and didn't graduate.\n\nThere's also no guarantee you get in the next time you apply.\n\nDid you only apply to two schools?  What are your other options besides Harvard?",

But I figure, if im going to ask, you're some of the best minds we have. \n\nIs it possible, to build a lightweight ExoSuit (Much like Batman Arkham Knight or Iron Man) to withstand heavy impact, gun fire, and to help lift/withstand a ridiculous amount of weight? \n\nWith resources and money.... Could someone, potentially, create a Supersuit?\n\nNow I know a bulky exo skeleton to help lift has been done. But I want to know if I can use lightweight, strong metals, and wiring for the skeleton. Maybe 3D print Kevlar for the actual surface area. Lmk thoughts.",

            "comment": "When you ask \"is it possible\" like this, it sounds like you're under some impression that people have just *settled* for a \"bulky exoskeleton to help lift\", instead of considering a better, lightweight, more protective option.\n\nI promise that whatever it is you're picturing, there are lots of people with lots of money who want it to happen too! You can look at something like the [Sarcos XO](https://sarcos.com/products/guardian-xo-powered-exoskeleton/) suit as a very modern and moderately mature product. If they could make this suit several times lighter and more protective, they would, I have no doubt. To put some numbers to it, the suits are planned to be leased at $100k/yr, and the company itself was recently bought for $1.3B.\n\nSo, when you ask, \"is it possible?\", I say: it is not currently reasonably achievable with an R&amp;D investment &lt; $10 billion and a per-unit production price of &lt; $ 100 million, otherwise someone would be currently making it. To put that into perspective, an R&amp;D investment of $10B would be enough to hire 3000 very smart engineers (at $200k/yr, x2 to include other costs) for 8 years. A pretty competitive and smart team! The one caveat is if it can be developed but is currently secret due to some contract with governments / military.\n\nThere's are a couple other meaningful senses of \"is it possible\". One is, \"could humanity ever eventually make a suit like this?\". Another is \"do the materials and manufacturing processes currently exist to make a suit like this?\" -- that is, can we make it with \"\"\"just\"\"\" major engineering effort, as opposed to more fundamental advances? As for the former, I would say \"definitely\" -- there's no reason why we couldn't, honestly!\n\nAs for the latter, well, I'd say \"probably\", but admit that I know very little about how difficult it is to make a suit like this. I don't see any reason you *couldn't* just wrap someone in Kevlar and wrap them in motors and EMG devices at the appropriate locations. If I had to guess, the biggest fundamental obstacle to a nice lightweight suit would be energy storage: you need something to power it, and a suit doing a lot of work will require a ton of power. Batteries weigh a ton, gasoline has other problems (heavy *and* hot), and unlike Fallout 4, we don't have anything like \"fusion cores\" yet! Alas.",

                    "comment": "Soooo not currently. Not what I'm picturing anyway.... I know later on once we get tech like the shit we're seeing in movies. I also don't know a thing about them which is why I wasn't sure if we COULD and just DONT cause effort/price being ridiculous (which from what you said, it is) or Can't which is why we don't. I figured power sources would be the big issue, along with whatever you'd need to help lift a superhuman amount of weight without it snapping your arms/legs. \n \nI really hope we do get somewhere on Lightweight, non bulky armour suits sooner than later tho. Even if I cant personally have one. I think it'd be dope having some SEALs or Marine Raiders all tact out in exo suits. Or workers not having to destroy their bodies for a paycheck anymore.\n\nSadly tho, I think another commenter either on here or on a separate group I also brought it up to, is that it'd just be cheaper and easier to replace us with bots. We all but have the technology for it already, and I think they'll worry about advancing automation before they'll ever focus on suits.",

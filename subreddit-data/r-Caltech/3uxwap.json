Frosh in a house with a lot of physics majors, for example, are more likely to hear about the physics option and get to know it. They will also probably have a stronger support system when taking intro classes in that subject so they may feel a greater understanding of the material and feel more comfortable pursuing it. Just some personal observations, obviously this isn't true in every case. ",

            "comment": "\\- Pet policy was changed: now no pets are allowed in any on-campus residences. This includes cats and snakes. Students have been sanctioned with removal from housing for violations of these policies. \n\n\\- Chouse is gone. It has been replaced by Haneetman cafe, which is open until 2am every day. \n\n\\- Influence of the houses during Rotation and PFE seems to be being decreased every year. This year, during online PFE, houses were not allowed to put on virtual events for the prefrosh. \n\n\\- Housing forced houses to alter their roompicks systems last year to be more \"fair and equitable\". For example, a system where priority was senior &gt; junior &gt; sophomore needed to be switched to a system where priority was senior &gt; junior = sophomore. This lead to a lot of suboptimal configurations. \n\n\\- Tom Mannion's budget is being decreased as the new ORE takes over his responsibilities. \n\nThere are definitely more changes I am forgetting. Some of these changes are better on paper\u2014for example, Chouse was only open on Sunday - Thursday until 1:30am, and Haneetman is open every day of the week until 2am. However, I still think that these changes make Caltech less special as a result. It's a shame but it really can't be stopped.",

                            "comment": "Here is Jshep's original November 2019 email. \n\n&gt;Effective immediately, the fireplaces in the South Houses must not be used and will be placed out of service indefinitely. This is a health and safety concern and we ask your cooperation in respecting the seriousness of this matter. We are working with a contractor  to close off the fireplaces with decorative screens (the historic features will be left untouched) and will explore possible alternative uses of the hearths, such as electric fireplaces. In the interim, please discontinue use of the gas burners and do not  use the fireplace for any burning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are taking these steps for three reasons:    \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. We recently had the fireplaces professionally inspected and learned of numerous deficiencies in both construction and maintenance. The inspector conducted a visual inspection of  the masonry, including the hearth, lintels, and fireboxes. A camera was  inserted  into each chimney to inspect the entire height. Numerous issues were  found during the inspection and the estimate for repairing the masonry  and chimneys is approximately $200,000 with the potential for higher  costs given the poor condition. This would not  be an appropriate expenditure given the more pressing needs to maintain  and renovate our aging residential complex.\u00a0\u00a0  \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Burning wood or other solid fuel in fireplaces is detrimental to the air quality in the Los Angeles basin, so much so that the installation of solid-fuel fireplaces within new construction in the Los Angeles basin is prohibited by law (see AQMD Rule 445).  Burning solid fuel degrades the air quality in the form of numerous pollutants that contribute to smog and particulates which are a significant health hazard both to the occupants of the houses, our campus, and the 18 million residents of greater Los Angeles.  Open hearth fireplaces are also primarily decorative and extremely wasteful as heat sources\u2014over 90% of the energy simply goes up the flue. The fireplaces were retained in the 2005 rehabilitation of the South Houses as they were considered historic features.  While AQMD allows fireplaces  to be preserved in historic structures, best practices followed by  homeowners and contractors in the Los Angeles basin are to leave the  decorative features in place and close off (colloquially referred to as \u201cbrick-up\u201d) the fireplaces  to prevent usage. This is what we plan to do.\u00a0  \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Fireplaces and the types of  fuel that can be used are strictly regulated under South Coast Air  Quality Management District Rule 445. The District issues mandatory  wood-burning bans during poor air quality and fire hazard conditions.  (See: [ http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/rule-book/rule-iv/rule-445.pdf?sfvrsn=4](https://caltech.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0657df8937aa6f6a60b025e79&amp;id=2987ce9157&amp;e=0cdbe36219)) The enforcement around the regulations for the use of fireplaces is challenging and exposes the Institute to unacceptable risk.\u00a0  \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Eliminating fireplace use in the South Houses is the most recent in a series of steps in phasing out fireplace use on campus. We removed fireplaces from the North Houses during the recent lounge remodels, the Avery fireplaces are currently not being used,  and we are asking our residence life staff that they not use the fireplaces located in their apartments. We did not install fireplaces in the Bechtel Residence apartments.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We understand that fireplaces  have long been a feature in the South Houses and that many will be  disappointed in this development. We appreciate your understanding and  cooperation as we develop alternative uses for the hearths and preserve  the historic facades.\n\nAs far as I recall, points 2 and 3 didn't even apply to the South Houses as the fireplaces there burned gas, not wood. Moreover, the $200,000 figure from point 1 is a gross overestimate. Housing was not even willing to consider the possibility of letting a house pay for the repairs using donated alum money. These arguments really feel like a formality\u2014the only point which rings true is point 4, which just says \"we want to do this so we will\". \n\nThe replacement electric fireplaces housing (surprisingly promptly) installed barely give off any heat. The south house lounges were COLD this winter.",

There were decorative fake logs but it was just gas burning. I have a lot of fond memories of napping on a couch in front of the fireplace in the middle of the winter, or even at night over the summer, the feeling of warm in front of you and cold behind is kinda hard to duplicate with any other heating mechanism. I for sure would've donated to repairs to keep the fireplaces :(",

            "comment": "(Bad stuff here, good stuff in the reply message)\n\nDabney is forbidden from calling our interhovse Drop Day or to hold it near drop day. Ricketts is likewise forbidden from holding Apache in its traditional form. There's a clear sense that if something goes seriously bad with interhovses in general they might be banned.\n\nAll the houses lost our hot tubs, and the promises we extracted in exchange still have not been honored. (In particular, Dabney was promised a renovation, and more than 3 years later housing is still deflecting our requests.) \n\nChouse is dead. (The new Hameetman center food is nice, but it's sad to not have Chouse anymore and the new frosh don't even remember it)\n\nThey've made it, year after year, harder to live off-off and to live off board, while board becomes more and more expensive. \n\nSomebody got control of housing about a year ago, and decided that he was going to put a stop to discrimination against smores in roompicks. He did so by making house leadership scramble to pass new roompicks procedures (near or during finals week iirc?)\n\nThey've made the pet policy much more restrictive and have flat-out broken disability laws to steal ESAs or threaten to evict people for having them. (Sidenote, if anybody is lawyer or knows one, this is a lawsuit waiting to happen and I for one would LOVE to see housing get their dues for this.)\n\nThe alcohol policy has been made much more restrictive and punitive. While I think it's somewhat better now, for a long time there was widespread fear of drinking in a social environment. \"Drink Alone In Your Room Like An Alcoholic Like Joe Shepherd Wants\" is a common slogan. RAs have been recruited as cops to patrol hallways and bust into loud rooms, eroding the trust between RAs and undergrads.\n\nSecurity has been largely replaced with contractors from Allied Security. While some of this is good (a number of officers are trained as EMTs and are very competent at dealing with alcohol or injuries), many of them still do not know Ruddock from Ricketts, which can be a real problem.",

It's very nice to have healthier options than chouse food open until 2am, and they have delicious pastries available all day.\n\nI really like Linde. It's a nice new building. And while I haven't spent much time in Bechtel, it apparently has a nice community in a way that Marks/Braun never did.\n\nMillikan pond, once drained during the drought, now has water flowing once more. There's a pair of mallards that likes to swim in it, and they're really cute. Prefrosh can once again see Caltech the way it was meant to be seen.\n\nWe've made some progress with getting better food and labeling for people with dietary restrictions. It's very far from perfect, but there's been some good news. \n\nOn a more local level, Dabney's grill nights have gotten exceptionally good, since our grillmaster started making his own rubs and seasonings. We've had redesigns to the pumpkin cart and the boat tours boat, both of which were falling apart but are now better than ever before. We have a new gazebo where the hot tub once was, which is a lovely place to eat lunch, play board games, or tattoo a pig fetus.\n\nA lot of the student support structures have changed. UCCs have been replaced with Peer Ads, which have an actual class worth of training. Safety squad was replaced with Orange Watch, which imo is working pretty well. Title IX ads are a new position that help promote the TIX office.\n\nChandler is now open for dinner, including pizza and grill stations",

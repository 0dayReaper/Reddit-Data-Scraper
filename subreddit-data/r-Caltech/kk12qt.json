If you fall into that category, check your email (although this post is over a year old, so I'm going to guess that's not quite what you're looking for). If you're looking for discussing Caltech admissions in general (as I'm guessing from your post history), try r/A2C. This subreddit is nominally for current Caltech students and alums, and we try to keep admissions content out.",

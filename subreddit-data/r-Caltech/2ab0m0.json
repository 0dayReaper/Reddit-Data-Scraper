But I have friend( person who I saw only once) and he is junior applying for UC Davis and he is already sending his test scores to them. Also, he is already taking some tests from UC Davis. As I said it might not completely not make sense. But is there anything (I looked through CALTECH website, but did not find anything) that I am suppose to send them before finishing high school? Thanks for the reply about the summer research programs",

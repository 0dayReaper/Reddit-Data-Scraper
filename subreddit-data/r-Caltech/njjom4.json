We are both male, but chill, open minded and respectful!\n\nWe would love to move in with other roommates, or just take over a furnished apartment for a few months! I hope I'm not breaking any subreddit rules by posting this, but I would greatly appreciate any leads!",

Might be too late, but I found a great room on [places4students.com](https://places4students.com) (suggested by someone else on this sub). It sounds kinda like a sketchy website lol but it worked really well for me and others have said the same. Sites like airbnb only have very expensive listings in Pasadena and places4students had fewer but much more reasonably priced options.",

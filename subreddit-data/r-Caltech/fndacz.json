    "postText": "Hey, I'm a highschool senior who is having a difficult time choosing a college to attend. I'm interested in majoring in biology and the other two schools I'm deciding between are definitely not as prestigious as Caltech, but still relatively known for their bio/premed programs. I already visited the school and liked the campus, but I was wondering if there is anything important about Caltech that I should make sure I consider when making my decision. Thank you so much!!!",

It is incredibly challenging to maintain a decent GPA at Caltech compared to many other colleges who are more known for grade inflation, or just aren\u2019t as challenging, and that matters a ton to med schools.",

It will hurt you at some and help you at others, depending on how understanding they are of deflated GPAs and how much they value the name. But in general, I'd say no. Grad school doesn't care nearly as much about GPA as med school.",

Your research advisor reference letters is probably the most important part of your grad school application, and there are a ton of amazing profs who take students into research even as freshman",

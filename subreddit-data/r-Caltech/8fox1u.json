    "postText": "I'm down to choosing between Caltech and Reed College. I am going to study mathematics and physics. My goal is to go to grad school and then into research/academia. I am not interested in engineering or getting a job after my undergraduate education. I had UC Berkeley in the mix, but I decided that I prefer the small and intimate setting of Caltech and Reed vs. the giant size of Berkeley.\n\nI like Reed and I'm  very comfortable with the faculty and campus, and it is of course known for its teaching quality and sending students to grad school. On other other hand, i liked Caltech too during my  Prefrosh visit and Caltech is such a topnotch institution. Just the thought of turning down an offer to go there seems like insanity lol...\n\nThe access to greater research opportunities and ability to take grad courses at Caltech (versus a purely undergraduate institution like Reed) seems like a big deal to me.\n\nAny advice? I know it is my decision at the end of the day but it would be great to hear others' insights. This is more stressful than applying and waiting for my first acceptance! \ud83d\ude04 Luckily, the deadline is May 1, so it will be over in a couple of days, one way or the other!",

                    "comment": "You should have a much much easier time getting into grad school in math or physics from Caltech. I looked at the course curriculum on Reed's webpage (http://www.reed.edu/math/courses.html), and there don't seem to be many advanced courses. Like only one semester each of topology, algebra, analysis and maybe 1 semester of additional topics - Caltech has a full undergrad year + a full graduate year in each of those areas, plus special graduate topics classes. Physics (http://www.reed.edu/physics/courses/index.html) at least has year-long courses in quantum mechanics and classical mechanics, but they're also missing a lot of things like qft, condensed matter, string theory, quantum computation, or only have a 1 semester intro course in those areas.\n\nCaltech also regularly sends people to math or physics grad school at places like Harvard, Princeton, Berkeley, etc. From anecdotal evidence I'd say more so than Reed.\n\nThe Caltech SURF program is also really good for applying to grad schools. Summer REUs (the usual way you do undergrad research at another uni) have become really competitive recently (some are harder to get into than grad school), so having the option to do SURF at Caltech basically guarantees you can get summer undergrad research experience regardless of REU application outcomes.",

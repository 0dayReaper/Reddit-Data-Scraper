    "postText": "Hello, I am currently a undergraduate junior at rensselaer polytechnic institute pursuing a dual major in electrical and computer engineering. I am currently doing research in machine learning for electrical grids. I have coauthored a conference paper in the past where I researched battery management systems for drones. I previously interned at a semiconductor company where I did software development. This summer I'm going to be interning at Western Digital working on data center solutions (probably will be heavily software based). I am interested in pursuing a masters in research fields such as energy, IOT or machine learning. I am probably going to have GPA between 3.3-3.4 by end of this spring. I will take GRE in few months. I am wondering if I have a chance of getting in considering most applicants will probably have very high GPA and come from more prestigious schools. Also is there anything I can do to increase my chances?\n\nEdit. I was also an undergad teaching assistant for embedded control lab class",

So I think I kinda flew in under the radar.\n\nI did do a lot of good work in undergrad/masters though. I have a lot of personal projects and one paper.",

I was one of two or three in the aero department doing a terminal masters, and sadly found out that was highly geared toward PhD candidates. There is no funding for non-PhD students, unless you bring it from an outside source. That said, there is a terminal master in the EE department and I knew some folks who did it and had a pretty normal (good but brutal) Caltech experience in that program.",

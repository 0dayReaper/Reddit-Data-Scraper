Based on [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/zb61bg/comment/iyq6qck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) the same seems to be true about Caltech (\"... you can't survive here (at least not comfortably) without a support structure to work/live with\"). What is the nature of your collaboration with other students?",

If you don\u2019t know something, try and solve it yourself. If you can\u2019t, ask a TA or a friend about their approach. Don\u2019t copy their work or just take an answer but emphasize how they got to that point. There\u2019s nothing wrong with admitting you don\u2019t know something. It can also be fun to do work with others instead of do everything yourself. Don\u2019t tell yourself you have to be able to do everything alone. That\u2019s not how learning works and that is definitely not how research works. That\u2019s not how most jobs work!",

            "comment": "The nature of the collaboration is 80% working on homework together.\n\nThe other 20% is asking people who aren't in your classes to help you with your homework anyway. :P (Usually people who took the class, or a very similar class, in a past year.)\n\nThe houses and the classes are both pretty small, so you should have no trouble meeting and hanging out with plenty of people doing similar classes as you.\n\nPlenty of people come to Caltech, not really used to asking their friends for help on homework? which makes sense, I mean. But when you've been struggling to understand how a sailboat works for three hours, and then you hear four people down the hall talking about it, it's pretty easy to walk over and ask them what they've got so far and figure it out together. Some experience like that usually happens in the first week of classes. And boom, study group, friends.\n\nHomework in Caltech classes is 100% designed for heavy collaboration. The teachers expect collaboration, and calibrate the homework accordingly. You will especially feel this to be true in the \"proof-y\" classes, like your freshman math classes, or maybe CS theory courses -- until you get the \"a-ha!\" moment for how to prove some theorem, you might bang your head against the wall for a couple hours without much progress.\n\nEach class has a collaboration policy. There's a \"standard\" one adopted for most classes, which is approximately, \"Talk about anything you want with anyone you want, google anything you want, but you have write up your solutions and your code entirely yourself. You can go and look at someone else's code or someone else's solutions, but you should take at least, say, a minute between looking at theirs and writing your own, so that you aren't just copying. You should only look at theirs to understand *how* to do something, and then do it yourself, not to copy exactly *what* they did. No collaboration is allowed for final exams.\" Some classes, like project classes, might have their own more precise collaboration policies, which the professor would give to you at the start of the quarter.",

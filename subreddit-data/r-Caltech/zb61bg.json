    "postText": "Hello, I will be joining the class of 2027 next year (admitted through questbridge) and I plan on majoring in physics. Also in Computation and Neural Systems *if* possible. \n\nMy first question is if double majoring is practical. I want to do as much research as I can during my undergraduate and If a second major would severely interfere with time to do research then that's also a reason that I wouldn't do it. The reason I would want to do an extra major in CNS is because my second interest, right behind physics, is machine learning, and my dream task is research at the intersection of physics, quantum computing, and machine learning. I think that I could keep learning machine learning through text books and reading papers (that's what I've been doing for the past two years anyways) but I think that Caltech would be able to teach me far better. So in your minds would it be a worth while / practical endeavor to do such a double major?\n\nMy second question has to do with the house system, I saw a post from 4 years ago which claimed that the house system was de facto dismantled or something. Is the house system still up and running as a hogworts esk support community system?\n\nMy third question is simply: how was your physics experience at Caltech in research and class?\n\nMy fourth question is simply if you could share any general advise for succeeding at Caltech.\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "1) It's relatively difficult to double major in a lot of the hard sciences (including Physics), but you can get most of the same effects from just taking electives in the fields you want. CNS and physics are also relatively far apart afaik, so it might be difficult to double count your classes there. There's also some chance that a CNS minor could get introduced in the next few years, but this is pure speculation based on the fact that this is a relatively new major/department. \n\n2) The house system has declined a good bit compared to how things were a few decades back, but it's still doing fairly well. The support here is quite accessible and definitely an integral part of the Caltech community. Just wait until rotation to get more information though, you don't want to spoil it for yourself. \n\n3) Not a physics, but know a good number of them. The coursework is known to be pretty challenging, but there's a lot of physics majors (relatively speaking) so you can find lots people to collaborate with. I think we have pretty good faculty that are good to work with, although I'm not sure how many might exist at the intersection of physics and CNS\n\n4) Time management is probably the most important bit, but finding a community you can collaborate and/or socialize with is probably the first thing you should work on. It's pretty doable post-rotation, but you can't survive here (at least not comfortably) without a support structure to work/live with.",

            "comment": "Lot of good advice here already. Double majoring in physics plus another unrelated hard science is very hard. Make sure to find a good study group. It's basically impossible to do entirely on your own.\n\nOne thing I wish I had done in retrospect was reading other textbooks on the subjects of the classes I was taking. The assigned books are not always the most friendly, so you can sometimes get better explanations by going to other books.\n\nI'd recommend going to office hours as much as you can, too, though it's not always possible. I was pretty good about going at the beginning of term but eventually I'd start to fall behind on problem sets and be starting them after the last office hours.",

            "comment": "Physics BS degree holder here, albeit from many years ago. If Caltech hasn't changed the physics major requirements much, then trying to do another major, particularly one where there is little overlap like CNS is unlikely if you value things like your mental health and sleep.\n\nDouble majors in general at Caltech tend to be done in closely related options, although there are always the disciplined geniuses who can pull off doing widely divergent options.\n\nThe main obstacle will be the core physics requirements that typically are taken in your junior year. If you really want to pursue obtaining a physics degree, taking CNS as your non-PMA electives are a nice change of pace. Not sure if they'll teach you better, but you should get a solid theoretical foundation of the field.\n\nI get you're still young, and it is unfair to demand you pick a path, but I would give serious consideration to why you want a physics degree. If you are currently very serious about continuing on and doing research within physics (ie: you are pursuing a physics PhD), then that's fine. But understand while I've not had major obstacles to employment because of it (thanks to the name of the institution), it is a lot of effort and pain if you ultimately decide that the life of physics researcher is not for you. There were a lot of physics majors I knew who decided they would get degrees in economics in their junior year, which seems like a big shift, but better to do it then than staring at an unfinished PhD thesis.",

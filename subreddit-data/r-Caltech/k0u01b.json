            "comment": "It may only be available for astro majors, but Ay 30 was very enjoyable.  It wasn't a real class (only 3 units).  Once a week you go to an astro professor's house for dinner and they talk a bit about their research, their path in astronomy, or whatever else they want to talk about.  I think there was a little presentation you had to do at the end to make it official.\n\nThe intro astro class for majors Ay 20 was pretty fun, too.  I don't know if they still do this, but when I took it we had to make an observing proposal about halfway through the course, and then they would take some observations at one of the Palomar telescopes based off your proposal.  (And there was a field trip to see the telescope that was taking your data at the end of the term.)\n\nI did like the optics and instrumentation lab (Ay 105), too.  There's normally not many people who take it (\\~4-6) so you get to know them pretty well being stuck in a small, dark room with them (and the prof) for six hours a week.\n\n(If you can't tell I was an astro major.)",

There was a class called Electricity Markets that I took junior year that I thought was *really* cool, the total amount of material covered wasn't that high but a lot of it was like \"woah I never would've thought of that---\" - just see whatever is listed in Ec/PS and sign up for a couple of them, and be totally prepared to drop it and switch to a different one after the first week if it seems boring haha.",

            "comment": "I'm now twenty years out and I actually did pretty much what you're planning in my own senior year and dropped a few final required classes for a double-major in favor of breadth and going into industry.\n\nBack then, my favorite class as a non-engineering senior was Glen George's EE51 at the time, the usual sophomore digital electronics class. It's hard work and my GPA took a small hit for the trouble, but also some of the most fun I had at Tech.\n\nLooking at the current 20-21 course catalog online, it looks like this material has been reconfigured to a newer scheme, perhaps EE/CS 10ab? EE7 also looks very similar and perhaps a little bit more up-to-date. The current EE undergrads can probably tell you more. If you like tinkering, robotics, IOT gadgetry, or retrocomputing, I think you'd probably like EE7 or 10. Speaking from personal experience, these skills are also very, very marketable if you end up in industry.",

I think it\u2019s a fun class that makes you think of a bunch of fields you normally couldn\u2019t care less about. \n\nBarring that, any class with Konstantin I highly suggest: he\u2019s a very entertaining professor and can reach contemporary research topics very quickly. \n\nI also would normally suggest Ge136, but clearly that\u2019s not applicable this year. \n\nThe Ch101(?) series are also really cool: just random like 2 units that are in a specific field which often has interest to non-chemists. I took one on planetary atmospheres or something like that and it was a real fun time. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the number of the class.",

I think it was like CNS/Bi 182 or something.  \n\nI would personally look for something cross-discipline that even slightly interests you.  Take advantage of the cutting edge science being done at Tech.  Next, try to take it from a name.  There are TONS of folks at Tech who are well known and it doesn't hurt to name drop a little bit.\n\nPh/CS 219 fits that bill.\n\nIf you're a worthless senior, then you may as well just take a bunch of stuff and see what you like.  You can even P/F some classes.  But get exposure.",

    "postText": "I don't know who else to ask this so forgive me if this is a stupid question. I was really surprised when caltech went test-blind since it has the highest average test scores in the country. Now that that's thrown out the window, what will admissions officers prioritize? I'm a little worried since my school doesn't offer many APs so my weighted GPA isn't *that* high (for caltech standards anyway). Also, I haven't done any competitive Olympiads or qualified for AIME. I do have some good unique extracurriculars but nothing extremely STEM research focused like many of the admits do. How much of a negative affect will this have? (I know you're mostly students/alumni so I don't expect a super in depth response). I just want some anecdotal evidence (if they even exist) of people getting in with similar circumstances.",

If you meet/exceed it, essays, ec\u2019s, letters of recommendation, and most importantly, demonstrated passion for STEM will be the deciding factors. (Note: This is purely my speculation; I do not work for Caltech\u2019s admissions office.)",

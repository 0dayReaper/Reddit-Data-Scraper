    "postText": "From the east coast!\n\nI'm an Aero sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic, working on my undergrad with the plan of going straight into Aeronautical or Space Eng in my graduate studies after I finish getting 'tute screwed.\n\nSomehow I missed the memo about Caltech when I was looking for schools -- In my search for a small, top-tier, sociable tech school, I ended up in New England shoveling snow instead of California on the beach. As a southerner from a small town, the more I read, the more I'm falling in love with your school. Apart from the obvious benefits (I'd imagine) for my field, the atmosphere and environment seems like it's everything that's missing from RPI.\n\nYou're currently top on my list of potential graduate schools. I'm working with a 3.84gpa with positive first *and* second derivatives -- if you approximate it as a continuous function -- two active research projects, and a pretty decent network of professors and departmental references.\n\nSo, how's graduate life at CalTech? What's a typical week(end) look like? What don't I know -- what's the catch?\n\nAcademically and professionally, apart from what I know from researching the school and talking with people in the field who've attended or worked there, is there anything outstanding that's going to be different from other, similar graduate schools?\n\nor if you just want to have a chat with an Engineer (yeah. That's our actual mascot. Creative, right?), I'm bored and mostly harmless.\n\nTL;DR NY is cold, can I come live with you?\n\nThanks for the read!\n\n--\n",

A typical weekend is entirely up to you - hiking, surfing, shows in LA, drinking, playing music, playing games, even learning to fly a plane are all pretty common choices here.  It's a small school, so the groups of people that do any given thing are usually pretty small.\n\nResearch is typically world class.  I don't know much about aerospace here other than that it's really good.",

            "comment": "Hey! Undergrad here, but I will try to answer for the grad program.\n\nWeekends: The campus is dead. People are still around, but they are working. Tech never \"bustles\" like larger schools. Theoretically, there are tons of great things just a train ride away, but 1) the Metro sucks and 2) there is still science to be done.\n\nTech's strength is it's size. You can look up all the crazy stats (3:1 student:faculty, highest concentration of Nobel laureates, etc), but it boils down to the fact that the small school means there are tons of resources available. [This](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/caltech-secrets-of-the-worlds-number-one-university/2011008.fullarticle) link does a good job explaining why.\n\nThe research opportunities are unparalleled. When people recognize the name (\"Wow Cal Poly... how's the beach?\"), they are impressed. And our mascot is also pretty lame (a beaver blatantly 'borrowed' from MIT).\n\n",

            "comment": "Hi there! Glad to hear you're looking at Caltech. \n\nYou really hit on the defining characteristics of Caltech in the phrase \"a small, top-tier, sociable tech school.\" \n\nWhat happens weekend to weekend varies wildly from week to week and person to person. In general, you can pursue any activity that you're passionate about, but there's rarely time to pursue things that you're only moderately interested in. \n\nTypically, I hang out with friends on Friday nights. Travel, meet up with friends or run errands Saturday/Sunday morning and start research/coursework Sunday evening. \n\nPasadena has what is called a \"Mediterranean Climate,\" which means amazing weather. Even during the winter, it's typically 75 degrees and sunny. \n\nYes, Caltech has a unique culture and is different from peer institutions in several ways:\n1) Small size. There's only 1200 graduate students and 1000 undergraduates. This means you'll bump into people you know quite frequently and it helps build a sense of community. \n2) Scientific focus. Everyone in Caltech studies some sort of science, which means your peers tend to have similar interests and goals. \n\nTL;DR If you looking for a small, top-tier, tech school, Caltech is a great choice!",

I have a number of friends who are Caltech grad students. \n\nMaybe you should be glad you didn't go to Caltech as an undergrad. While there are good research opportunities for undergrads, and the Caltech name is impressive to those who recognize it, I found undergrad life extremely stressful and not worth it. There certainly wasn't much time or opportunity to go to the beach. But maybe Rensselaer is like that, too, and maybe I just wasn't passionate enough about math and science or good enough at it. \n\nFrom what I hear, grad student life at Caltech probably isn't that much different from grad student life at other top institutions. Some grad students are very busy and work all the time, but many of them still seem to have more free time than the undergrads, or at least they're better at managing time.",

Really similar schools. Just different location, weather, and smaller number of people here. Also probably better for an Aero PhD. I think Caltech is definitely the best place to get a graduate degree (especially if you want to go into academia), though sometimes I miss the perpetual gloom of the capital region.",

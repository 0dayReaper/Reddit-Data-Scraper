We have google drive for some usefull materials, and I am pretty sure that no one from other russian universites knows about this, but it is obviousy free to use, and if you search it and mipt.ru you will probably find all lectures you need in russian, some of them are unique and better than any book. So, now I am studying quantum mechanics, and found that existing lectures are quite good, but probably some nuances are not explained quite good and easy for understanding. I guess that you guys met problems like this, so can you please share drive with lectures or something like this if you have one and if it is free to use of course? ",

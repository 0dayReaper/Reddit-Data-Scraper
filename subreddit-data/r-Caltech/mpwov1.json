Not a grad student, but generally Caltech doesn\u2019t have any bad departments, just sometimes not specialized enough departments. Try looking for other sources comparing the departments. That said, CMS (which includes CS, ACM, and IDS) is a newer department relatively speaking, so it might not have the depth or history you\u2019d find at some other schools. On the other hand, there\u2019s plenty of great talent here as well, and it\u2019s Caltech.",

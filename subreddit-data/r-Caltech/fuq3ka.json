            "comment": "I'm a recent alum, and from Wa too - so I'm fairly familiar w/ UW, but am not in CS so I'm generalizing a bit (if you already have particular interests in subfields or anything that's a lot more nuanced conversation I can't help much with)\n\nIt depends more than a bit on what you want out of school. \n\nAcademically speaking, if you want a solid education &amp; to get on to industry quickly then UW is a competitive option esp. since you think you can graduate quickly; it's a great school and you'll get everything you need there. If, however, you want a (significantly) more academically challenging experience then Caltech is definitely the way to go. It'll challenge you in multiple disciplines beyond CS and give you everything you need and more - I think the reason/fact it doesn't accept credits is mostly well founded since it'll (mostly) start off where or slightly after where APs or other advanced high school/early college programs left off while UW will repeat some of that material for the first year or more. 'tech will also in general have a significantly more accelerated pace than UW; it's a much more trial-by-fire environment. I had a similar choice back when I got in -  I had some credits &amp; could have graduated UW pretty quickly if I'd gone there. I chose Caltech for the challenge and have been pretty happy w/ that. I definitely feel that it pushed &amp; challenged me to be significantly better in my field than I would have been otherwise/at UW even if I could hve gotten through UW more quickly or easily. That being said, if you're very well motivated &amp; good at challenging yourself outside of what you're already good at (&amp; depending on your interests) you can probably learn everything you'd learn at 'tech anywhere else/on your own too.\n\nBeyond academics, the social aspects of each school are dramatically different. \n\nFirstly, Caltech is a significantly smaller school, and your whole cohort in CS at 'tech will be about the size of a single smaller classroom at UW, and your whole class at 'tech about the size of an intro CS lecture at UW.\n\nCaltech also has a pretty unique social scene that is a big selling point (and has academic impacts) - in my opinion anyway - compared to UW's pretty typical college social life. Going to 'tech means surrounding yourself completely w/ wicked smart people - everyone is really really good at what they do and very passionate. This leads to a geeky AF culture, but in a way that amplifies basically any given interest rather than narrowing down the interests people there have. The House system does a good job of introducing you to people in lots of fields &amp; interests and from other years (I think the cross-class, cross-discipline social interactions at 'tech are undersold), and particular houses have vibrant and interesting cultures/subcultures that make them interesting and fun places to live (IMO).\n\nA CS someone can probably pitch in more about the major. But this is the general spiel I'd give comparing the schools.",

Especially since you mention an interest in deeper (more theoretical) subjects like ML and quantum computing (I can say that 'tech is a really really good place for quantum computing), I wouldn't worry so much about not getting as much \"coding experience\" from classes, since you can get that &amp; learn languages etc. between classes &amp; on your own much more easily than the theory stuff anyway.\n\nIt's an especially good place for quantum computing. UW is very solid there but I think 'tech is definitely the better choice for undergrad if that's a big interest.\n\nEdit: also funding generally isn't that hard to come by at 'tech cuz it's so small there's a lot of funding per capita. As an undergraduate it may actually be easier to come by than at UW - you may want to look ahead at the SURF program if finding research funding/opportunities is something you're looking into.",

In terms of quality of education, you won't be able to get a much better degree elsewhere.\n\nHowever, some caveats:\n\nCaltech does not foster a culture of entrepreneurship or startup culture nearly as well as most other colleges.\n\nThe amount of coding practice you get at Caltech is relatively low. You will spend most of your time on theory classes, as well as a lot of non-cs courses. The math requirement for CS at caltech is generally a bit higher than at other colleges.\n\nCaltech has some grade deflation. If you're looking to be a software engineer, this is basically irrelevant, as being an average to below average student should have little effect on your job search. If you want grad school, Caltech is hard\n\nCaltech is very stressful. Classes are hard. If you aren't planning on working hard, don't go.",

            "comment": "I did my undergrad at Tech and I'm now a TA at a medium sized public university, so I feel like I can give you some insight into what your next four years will look like for both options.\n\nCaltech: you will receive a world class education in CS. I wasn't a CS major, but I worked on research with the CS department, and I think it's fair to say that CS at Tech is very theory oriented. If you're interested in getting a PhD in CS, then Caltech is definitely the right choice. If you're interested in quantum computing, then Caltech is, again, the right choice. If you're interested in start-ups, then Caltech is a great place to meet people with similar interests, although some warning -- Caltech's emphasis on theory means you'll have to practice coding on your own. If you're passionate about coding, this shouldn't be a problem -- however, depending on the classes you take and how you manage your mental health, you might not have a lot of spare time on your hands.\n\nI never pulled an all-nighter at Tech, although I came dangerously close once. That doesn't mean I wasn't stressed -- I lost clumps of hair during my four years there, and dropped about three pounds, which wasn't great, because I was already bordering underweight. I didn't have time to eat, and even though I didn't struggle with depression or MHI, I knew people who did. Catech is not for the faint of heart -- I think I can say that I enjoyed my four years there, but there were times when I was returning to campus after a weekend spent at home, and I'd just look at the dorms and wish that I didn't have to go back so soon.\n\nMedium sized public university: obviously this varies from school to school, but unless the students here are in the special track, then it's hard for them to receive individual attention. The ones in the special tracks take different classes, are on a different grading scale, and I assume have individual counseling, which makes it easier for them to get on research projects. The others have to hunt for opportunities on their own. Some of them come to the TAs -- like me -- for help, which means they spend a lot of time talking to us and hoping that we can hold their hands through the process. I do it for some of my favorite students (yes, we have favorites and no, your grades have nothing to do with your favorite status), but I already feel overworked and underpaid as it is. I'll probably remember you if it's your second time taking my class, but unless you've worked as the TA to my TA, or you spend a disproportionate amount of time at my office hours and you're actually asking me interesting questions instead of expecting to be spoonfed answers, then I probably won't take the time to look over that email you're writing to send to the professors. The classes are huge -- I'm teaching two hundred students right now -- and it's easy to get lost in the shuffle. I don't think you will -- you made it into Caltech, I'm sure you'll ace the classes at UW -- but the truth is, you won't have the same opportunities you'll have at Caltech unless you're very charming and very lucky.\n\nI'd probably lean towards Caltech, unless you are very attached to your family in Washington (which is very understandable, because I've opted to stay in SoCal for my family). As for AP credits -- one of the guys I knew in high school decided to go to Cal so he could cash in on his AP credits, and he fulfilled the graduation requirements in three years, before deciding that he didn't want to graduate that early, so he did another year. To be fair, he was born late in the year and would have been graduating at twenty if he'd stuck to his original plan, and this might have influenced his final decision, but I think he also enjoyed college too much to leave early. Things change. People change. Don't base your decision on AP credits, unless you're 100% sure you want to graduate in three years to save tuition.",

                            "comment": "You do get practical experience in class, although this does depend somewhat on the courses you take. Quantum computing is mostly the physics department's thing, although there is one or two professors (I only know one) in the CS department who's doing quantum cryptography. The truth is, if you're interested in quantum computing, it's almost always better to get your degree in physics -- although in light of the pandemic, I'm a bit wary of encouraging people to pursue their passions (in physics), because I'm pretty sure we're looking at a years long recession at this point.\n\nQuantum computing is a vast field. If you're interested in quantum encryption, then stay in CS. If you're interested in *building* a quantum computer, then look into physics -- the condensed matter department has a few professors working on this. If you're looking into quantum algorithms, that also happens to be research the *physics* department is working on right now at Tech.\n\nIf you're planning on going into quantum computing, then you'll have to get a grad degree, and this is where things get dicey. Caltech has one of the best programs in quantum computing. The university I'm at currently is also great -- but it's world-renowned in the experimental side of quantum computing and has great connections with companies, which means making compromises I didn't think I'd have to make. If you're going into quantum computing, then *Caltech's* strengths in quantum computing will not really affect your career -- in the end, it's the grad school you choose that decides how far your career in quantum computing will progress.",

            "comment": "If you want experience with machine learning and quantum computing, I'm not sure if favoring practical experience over theory is the correct approach. Machine learning definitely has practical uses these days, but quantum is still a topic that only really exists in theory these days. I'm also a little confused as to why you want to do research throughout the year if your interest is in the corporate world. It could be cool, but I feel research profs are looking to do pretty theoretical things that would interest future PhDs more. \n\nAs a recently graduated Caltech CS major, I'd have to say while we definitely seem to do more theory and less practical stuff, I've never struggled at my job for practical tasks. Technologies change constantly, the core knowledge I've learned will continue to serve me for a long time. Caltech students get plenty of offers from companies, and going to one of the big companies (Google, FB, Microsoft, etc.) is a pretty reasonable goal for most people since those companies heavily recruit at what is a very small school. If you brush up on your interview technique outside of class, you'll have all the skills you need to land a good job. Outside of the major itself, the classes you'll have to take can be burdensome if you're not a fan of other sciences. Having to take Chem, physics, etc to graduate can be a real pain. The culture at Caltech is definitely interesting, personally it suited me and I really loved my time there (outside of the workload). We also don't have a competitive cs department as I hear UW does, and we're pretty laid back on attendance too.",

I'm definitely more interested in internship opportunities since that helps with my corporate goals but since I am also interested in learning quantum I was hoping to do research related to it at least once during my undergrad experience. I didn't think about practical vs theory in that way this insight really helps since it makes sense that more complicated topics like machine learning and quantum would be more theory-heavy. I was also curious about what you meant by the UW CS department being more competitive (like did you mean competitive to get into?).",

Also they seem to have higher standards. We got a new lecturer from UW who seemed really shocked that caltech students don't go to class since at UW he had 96% attendance while at Tech he had to slowly work his way up since a ton of students just don't go to class at all. I don't know what you need to maintain at Caltech since we don't really have limits on who can be in what major. It'd be difficult to get quantum research without a lot of class work in it, we're talking at least 2/3 physics classes about quantum and at least one or two graduate level courses.",

The CS major includes an intense mathematical core, and classes are generally oriented much more towards theory and research than practical coding. Don't put yourself through all that if it doesn't interest you.\n\nUW has a well-regarded department and will do just fine for getting you in the door for internships. Those internships will be more valuable to you than school in terms of experience and building a resum\u00e9 to get further offers.",

            "comment": "This is so old that you've probably decided at this point, but figured that I'd post with some of my experiences with CS at both schools. (My older sister goes to UW for CS and I go to Caltech for CS).\n\n  \n\\- Caltech relatively recently hired a faculty member from UW CS. My sister said he was a really good teacher but \"something something bureaucracy\" made him leave. Obviously, those are just rumors but fundamentally, I think there might be something to be said about the fact that he left UW for Caltech.\n\n  \n\\- UW CS is much larger than Caltech. I'm sure the experience varies, but she's had trouble getting interviews at school career fairs due to the size of the talent pool, where I've never had an issue (of course, getting the internship after the interview is a different question, but I think a foot in the door is pretty valuable). Of course, since Caltech is smaller, there are less companies that visit, but I think the student:recruiter ratio is much more favorable at Caltech.  \n\n\n\\- Research during the year is much more accessible at Caltech, in my observation. The CS department at Caltech frequently sends emails from professors asking for undergraduate assistants whereas my sister had to interview, talk about funding and filter through many rejections for various reasons (big pool of applicants, not much money, the usual.)  \n\n\n\\- Ranking really doesn't matter at the undergraduate level. When deciding in between schools, I also looked into rankings. After all, they are a quantitative measure of schools. However, popular rankings seem to focus on grad-level topics, which is irrelevant for now. There are also some sketchy factors of rankings where people give their \"general impression\" (literally brand name) of the departments instead of concrete measurements.\n\n\\- Caltech also gets a lot of funding for CS. You mention that UW does, and its CS program is much larger. However, there has been shifts to increase hires and support the CS program at Caltech.  \n\n\n\\-- things you didn't ask for but I want to share --  \n\\- I'm kind of jealous at the amount/participation of clubs at UW. My sister has picked up dance, and has also found lots of friends through societies/organizations. At Caltech, most people are busy with academics and research, and extracurricular clubs are not as appealing to most students. Of course, they are still there at a smaller scale, but its really dependent on how much time you want to put into them.   \n\n\n\\- My sister said that Caltech's intensity and House system fosters more strong friendships than the ones she has found through clubs/school at UW. At UW, classes also seem to be graded on a harsher curve, so she was pretty lonely for a while, whereas I think my support system at Caltech (where collaboration is heavily emphasized) was much stronger from the get-go.\n\n\\- UW is in a very urban area. My sister has the luxury of hanging out with friends at coffee shops, grabbing a bite to eat when she doesn't feel like eating board food, or very convenient public transportation if she wants to explore. At Caltech, the school is in a pretty suburban area, so you need to do a bit of walking/ubering if you want to get off-campus. \n\n\\- Caltech might give you more options in the future if you decide you want to go to grad school. Ultimately, this was the deciding factor for me. Both schools are extremely strong, but Caltech seemed to give me more options. For example, some classes at UW are only available to students of a certain major, whereas at Caltech, taking a wide variety of classes is encouraged. Imo, CS has many cool applications, so being able to learn more about other fields is nice even if not directly relatable to a software job.",

            "comment": "My son is a sophomore CS @ Caltech and loves it.  Hes been through many of the courses already, so he could probably amswer specific questions. They have been flexible to let him take classes outside his major and even double major, in case you love other stuff outside of CS.  Hes been able to take grad classes for some of his interests.\n\nBut yea, if you have specific questions about the CS program, I can ask him-- he's coming home tomorrow.  We were in your shoes 2 years ago-  I know its hard to know what questions are worth asking.  I can't imagine you'd be disappointed from the standpoint of a technical qualit of classes.  Caltech has a pretty rigorous set of core classes, so you will get a good dose of their basic science classes.  \n\nRegarding accepting AP credit, i think you will understand why they don't accept it once you are there.  I'm a 48 yr old EE and I work with calculus, electromagnetics, matrix algebra, algorithms, etc.  I took many of the *same* courses in a state school.  But some of the topics he's covered-- and the speed at which its covered-- makes me choke.  The endless problem sets due weekly are really tough.    The stuff I took was a watered down, spoon fed version by comparison, despite having the same name.  So yea, your AP stuff will benefit you tremendously, but it wont qualify for credit.   \n\nThere are even Analytic and Practical tracks you can choose for some courses.  This also impacts what you are getting from the courses.  He took the analytic track for Matrix algebra, and the prof covered A LOT of theoretical topics and much of the course involved proofs and analysis.... same for calculus and real analysis math.  The TA covered the lower level stuff... like actual problem solving.  Ive looked through all his problem sets- i would have a tough time doing any of it-- it was almost entirely proving things about the math and what is solveabe,  etc.  Solving actual number problems is just a byproduct of all the other stuff he learned about the real ma th behind it.  Hes got a MUCH deeper foundation that I had.\n\nHow that compares to UW, i cant say for sure.  But Caltech will let you go as far as you want to go, and push you further.",

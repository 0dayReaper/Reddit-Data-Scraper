    "postText": "Current Berkeley undergrad here, trying to decide between doing a MechE major + EECS minor or just double major in both.\n\nIf I double major, I will have to take 5 stem classes (20 units each) during fall and spring semester sophomore year and take 3 summer classes this summer (planning to do 2 H/SS classes and one math class). After sophomore year, Ill be taking the regular 16 units a semester (all technical electives/stem classes).\n\nCould double majoring be a significant benefit for applying to grad school (Id like to do an M.S. in AeroAstro) or would a minor suffice?",

            "comment": "Galcit grad here...\n\nI don't know if that double major would specifically help. I think in general myself and my classmates likely got in based on having done research as an undergrad that was related to Galcit topics, great reference letters, and a personal statement that aligned with Galcit's direction. I believe a very good GPA and test scores are also expected. \n\nThe last one I think is especially important -- they generally don't admit people *just* for a master's degree. They want people for the PhD. \n\nSo that said -- are you doing any undergraduate research? Are you engaged with some folks that could act as your reference letter writers?",

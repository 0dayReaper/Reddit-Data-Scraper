    "postText": "I'm a [non-Caltech] university student who's taking some classes in entrepreneurship and recently I've become curious about what measures different universities take to encourage a culture of entrepreneurship and to facilitate students and graduates to create startups or engage in entrepreneurial activities. \n\nDoes CalTech have any events or classes or competitions that you think creates entrepreneurs? Is it a way of thinking encouraged by your classes? Do you feel that there is actually a culture of entrepreneurship at Caltech, or am I under a faulty assumption? \n\nThanks for any help!

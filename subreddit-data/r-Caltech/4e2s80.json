    "postText": "Hello! I am a freshmen in high school and Caltech is what I'm gunning for. I would love to study physics and philosophy in my future. I am just wondering what looks good on an application and what I should do to increase my chances of getting in. Currently I am a straight A student, president of my own club of philosophy, Vice President of our MESA club, and treasurer of our Skills USA club. Outside of school, I do cross fit and am learning guitar and how to play music. Also, would taking collage classes over summer help? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "look up the three questions on the admissions office when they value applicants. you have so much time and don't worry too much. \n\nmy two cents: GO BEYOND CLASSROOM for STEM. Getting 800s and taking 20 AP sciences aren't enough. Do a summer research project with professors in the area. Go to a math camp like PROMYS next summer. Learn how to code and do your own projects (comes in handy when you are trying to apply to internships in college and CS interns get paid ~$20k a summer). Do some AMC/contest math. Do quiz bowl, science olympiad. Take classes on coursera... \nAnd, just be a cool person and do interesting stuff ",

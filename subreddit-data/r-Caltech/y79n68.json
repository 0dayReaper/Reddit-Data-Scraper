She is learning some extracurricular material, like mathematics, some kinda of online CS classes etc. \nShe is very smart, but a bit lazy(lol)\nPlease advise what she needs to focus on , to be able to get a scholarship and study in Caltech.\nI want to create all the necessary options for her to succeed.\nThank you all in advance",

I didn\u2019t learn until after I scored an 800 Math (twice) that Caltech is test-blind so that was sad :(, but I\u2019m pretty sure that 95% of Caltech admits can score a 780-800 Math if it were required. Honestly though, after a 750, the curve starts becoming weird, on some tests you can miss 2 math questions and get a 790 where on others you can miss 2 and be down to a 760-770, so I\u2019d just tell your daughter to aim for a 750+ on math because 760/770ish is where the 99th percentile is. Caltech\u2019s previous classes also had insanely high R&amp;W scores (730+) but I\u2019d keep in mind that most people applying to Caltech are also applying to Stanford + Ivies who value R&amp;W just as much as math unlike MIT and Caltech who mainly value Math (but a strong R&amp;W score is needed, you can\u2019t have a 780M and a 620RW and think you\u2019re fine). Caltech is really competitive, so even extremely intelligent and hardworking people can get rejected, so the main reason I mentioned the SAT is for MIT, which is almost identical to Caltech in many aspects. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d just tell your daughter to take the most advanced STEM courses that her school offers and do well in them (GPA of Caltech admits range between 3.8-4.0), get a high SAT score (even though Caltech is test-blind, I\u2019d still recommend to take the test because there\u2019s nothing wrong with reviewing the basics. Just from reviewing SAT math, my algebra skills got sharper and it became useful in AP Calculus BC and even in Linear Algebra. It\u2019s also a good way to see if your daughter is worthy of being at Caltech. A person who can\u2019t score above a 750 math shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to apply in my opinion), join some STEM-focused clubs and win STEM awards (since your daughter wants to go into CS, I\u2019d recommend USACO. I want to go into physics/astrophysics and I qualified for USAAAO Camp - top 25 in US), join some non-STEM clubs too, and to overall, have fun and know that whether she gets accepted or rejected from Caltech, it does not determine her worth as a person.\n\nBest of luck to your daughter again, and if I go to Caltech (probably not lol) I hope to see your daughter there",

            "comment": "For the most part the recipe for getting into Tech is going to be the same as any other top engineering school: \n\n* Excellent grades. \n* Excellent Standardized Tests (if they are still in use when she applies). \n* Good well written essays. \n* A demonstrated interest in science / engineering / technology. (See: Clubs, competitions, projects, research, ect.)\\*\n* **Luck**\n\n\\*For me this was projects, but I had friends who did all sorts of stem things in HS. \n\nI think the real question is \"Why Caltech?\". Tech's CS department is great, but there are tons of schools with great CS departments.  Tech also has a particularly brutal curriculum (even by CS standards), which includes substantially more math, physics, and humanities then she would face in most CS departments. If you want that kind of environment it is great, but that decision should come from her. There are tons of other great engineering programs out there!\n\nIf a merit scholarships are important you should not dismiss the the mid-range engineering schools. A lot of them will offer substantial discounts for good students, and also provide an excellent education.  I don't know if this is still true, but when I applied WPI, RPI, and the like offered a 50% tuition discount to competitive students with a psat above a certain threshold. \n\nAnyway, my 2c as a former techer would be to focus on making sure that your daughter reaches 12th grade with good grades, and her interest in CS intact. Definitely help her look into STEM clubs and keep an eye out for all-girl STEM spaces.  At the end of the day a good, motivated, student will do well in any CS program, and by the time college starts that has to come from her.",

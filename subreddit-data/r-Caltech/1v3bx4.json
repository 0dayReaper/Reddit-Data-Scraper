I see a lot of positives (i.e. \"it's just harmless nerds boosting girls' self confidences\") and negatives (i.e. \"men maliciously singling out women\") around on the internet, so I'd like to know how things actually are - how men view it, how women view it, maybe even how faculty view it. Any stories are appreciated!",

None of them have any idea how to attract women**, so they literally just hang around said women as frequently as possible in the hope that one of the women likes them.\n\nThere are few positives for the growth of the men, and it doesn't really boost confidence, since it's very clearly a poor market. It's also very, very rarely malicious - I can think of maybe one time in four years that even the slightest bit of genuine creepy got into the process.\n\nI'm not sure what you're looking for in terms of \"how people view it\" - what do you get out of knowing that?\n\n\n**I am not saying that nobody at Caltech knows how to attract women. I'm saying that a large number of men don't. There still are socially normal people. They're just the minority. :)",

Sometimes you have to physically remove them, bless their hearts, so you can get a moment alone. I never saw it being malicious. Thank you for bringing back that little piece of history. I'm strangely amused\"\n\nEdit to add...congratulations!",

If you feel comfortable telling a guy \"I'm not interested in you\" or \"Please leave my room, I'm busy right now\", you'll be pretty much fine. I did occasionally see actual problems, but that's more similar to what happens at most colleges, I think. Worry more about if you're a good fit in general. Tech is amazing if you are, but it can be a nightmare if you aren't. ",

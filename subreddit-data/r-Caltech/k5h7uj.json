I am from Italy and I wanted to know if there are some scholarships, fellowships or more in general financial helps for people like me at Caltech. In fact I can\u2019t afford the whole tuition and the life costs. If you\u2019ve also some other suggestions I would be very pleased. Thanks!",

I paid less by TAing some classes, but I still had to shell out a good amount of money.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this program is not worth it especially if you don't have a company sponsoring you for your masters. If you have any questions I'd be sure to give you my 2 cents.\n\nGood luck!",

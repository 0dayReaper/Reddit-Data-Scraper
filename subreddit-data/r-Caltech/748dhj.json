    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm planning to apply for PhD program, but still can't choose between EE and MedE.\nI've found few research groups on biomedical engineering, but I want to do the electrical part mostly. So, i don't really know if it is necessary to apply for MedE to apply for those labs, or if EE is okay. Also, is there a difference in chances between these 2 programs?\nThanks in advance!\nP.s. is it okay to bother professors of those labs/admission offfice with these kinds of questions? ",

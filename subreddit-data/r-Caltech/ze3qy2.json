    "postText": "My country's educational system is not the best. Although they cover extensively STEM-related topics, Calculus is the exception. Would I be able to self-study calculus to apply to Caltech, or just apply without taking it? My family doesn't have the money to pay for an AP exam (we'd have to travel to another city and the fees are too much for us), so I don't know if they accept Khan academy points lol\n\nJust to be clear, my school doesn't offer \"opt-in\" courses. We just study what we are told to for the entirety of High School, even stuff we don't like. I never had a chance to choose a math class to take or something similar.",

Caltech won't credit you for it. You will want to, ideally be at AP Calculus levels prior to entering, so if you do the self-study route and are comfortable with AP level problem sets or practice tests, that should be sufficient for surviving freshmen mathematics.\n\nI would hope the admissions committees would take your country's educational system into account, though.",

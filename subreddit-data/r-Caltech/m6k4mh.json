(So, enthusiast set, not professionally set). It\u2019s probably 10\u2019X30\u2019 and is split into two sections (there is a section that divides it into two sides where they store some equipment and the additional walls act to give 2 more climbing surfaces). \nI always have a good time when I go. I am [was] a V4-V5 climber and have always found a good range of easy to challenging problems.",

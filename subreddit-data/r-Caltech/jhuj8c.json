    "postText": "Hi\n\nAs a freshmen applicant to Caltech EA, I can\u2019t help but worry about my GPA. I consistently perform poorer in my honors science courses than the AP course at my school. For instance, I scored a B+, A-, and A- in Honors Bio, Chem, and Physics (respectively) but As in both AP Bio and Chem (currently taking Phys C this year). Also, my math grades have never been great either (A- all three years). All of this has weighed down my GPA, and I\u2019m wondering how the Caltech admissions officers might make of this, as its my dream school and they have notoriously high standards.\n\nAny insight is appreciated. Thanks.",

            "comment": "Being completely honest and as someone who has never been a part of the admissions committee, not getting the highest marks on your math and science courses will bel extremely damaging to your application. Bear in mind my info is about 10 years old, and there's been some changes to the core curriculum that may have changed how applicants are evaluated now.\n\nIt is a \\*huge\\* red flag to not have A's in your math classes.  Every undergraduate has two years of mandatory mathematics courses that in most places would easily qualify you for  a minor in math. Most accepted applicants will have taken AP Calc B + C and have scored 5s on their exams. Those that haven't because their school did not offer such courses must have demonstrated some sort of ability to learn mathematics at the Caltech level. This means taking the highest level courses available and doing well in them.\n\nHowever, there are ways you can shore up your application despite non outstanding science / math grades.\n\n1. demonstrate a high degree of scientific / engineering interest and participation. This can be doing well in math / science competitions, conducting research, etc. Doing well in the Olympiad or Intel competitions will almost certainly guarantee you a spot despite your grades.\n2. have a really good jump shot and be able to dunk. While officially athletics explicitly does not help your admissions chances, generally people recognize that not everyone  devotes all their time to studying.  The committee might be more willing to take a chance on someone who has demonstrated skills in other areas while still demonstrating decent time management skills by maintaining decent grades. Also a student on the committee might be on the team or a faculty member is a fan. As an example, one of the math professors is a former national level water polo player, though I don't think he's on the committee.\n3. Somehow show you will be well prepared to handle Caltech core requirements some other way.",

Seems like my suspicions are accurate. \n\nAbout the three ways I could potentially shore up the app, I have a few ECs I think may help. I participated in the ISEF regional finals for my location after submitting a research paper and being selected out of a group of people. This summer I also participated in the Summer Science Program for astrophysics of which Caltech is affiliated with. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve heard of these and whether you have further insight on how these ECs may impact my app. \n\nI\u2019ve also done some external research but haven\u2019t won awards or anything for them, although I have mentioned it in my activities section.\n\nThanks again for your contribution",

I was accepted after getting a C in physics my junior year. Considering you scored better in AP classes than you did in Honors classes, that could very well signal that it\u2019s just the way your high school handles grades. It shows you understand the content but your school just deflates grades for the Honors courses possibly.",

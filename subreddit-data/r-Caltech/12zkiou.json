            "comment": "If by scholarship displacement, you mean essentially getting financially penalized for earning outside scholarships, our student was very much impacted by it. I believe this is not caltech specific but dictated by federal law. If a student is receiving $ from caltech based on fafsa, They only allow the student to use a certain amount each year even if the parents contribution is still say $40k.The parent is still on the hook for the $40k and if the student uses their outside scholarship money over the above allowed, the caltech grant (if they qualify for it) will be reduced. Our student earned over $150k of outside scholarships and it was like playing a game of chess trying to make sure we were able to use it all so that it didn\u2019t affect whatever $ caltech was giving. As it stands, 20k of the outside scholarship money will go unused. It\u2019s a bit complicated to explain via messaging. The bottom line is, if you can get your outside scholarship granting authority to delay payment to future years so that it benefits your situation, do it. Most are more than happy to do this after explaining your situation although I think they were a bit more lenient because they used covid as an exception in our particular case. Another thing to consider is if you have 2 or 3 children in college at the same time, that will affect what money you may or may not get from caltech. This will be a determining factor on when you want to use whatever outside scholarships you have (if said student is the younger one, wait to use outside scholarship money until siblings graduate when you are less likely to get help from caltech based on fafsa bc now only one student in college). There are other ways that allow you to use more outside scholarship money such as using for purchasing a computer, travel and other things. Check the website on that. My advice is you start this process early and have a four year plan. Make sure you know the $ amount of outside scholarship money  you can use before it affects money you get from caltech. Obviously, you want to maximize the amount of $ coming directly from caltech. If your student earns outside scholarship money and it is sent directly to caltech, they WILL apply it. They will not hold it for the next year. We had an issue with that even though the granting institution for the scholarship specified it was for the next year. We requested the money toward the end of the year to be used for the next year, and they applied it to the current year even though we were already paid up in full for the year and then our student got an email stating we OWED money (it almost affected class registration) Be vigilant, be on top of it. Our student was very involved in the process. Make sure your student is staying on top of emails, etc. I could go on and on. If you have any specific questions I didn\u2019t answer, ask away.",

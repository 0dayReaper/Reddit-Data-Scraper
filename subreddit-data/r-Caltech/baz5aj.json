    "postText": "I'm a newly admitted Caltech student who's looking for some advice on whether to do a Compsci or IDS major at Caltech.\n\nI'm looking at possibly becoming a data analyst for tech companies or financial firms out of undergrad to pay off loans, then moving into a biotech startup. The combination of computer science, math and statistics provided by the new IDS major sounds really promising, but does anyone think I'll have issues getting a job?\n\nApparently this IDS major was created only this year, so I'm not sure if that will impact employers view of me, or limit my employment opportunities.\n\nI would appreciate anyone who's doing IDS, or anyone with knowledge of how tech recruitment usually works, for giving me advice on whether to major in IDS or not. \n\nThanks!",

We're all interviewing without a strong bias in that regard. \n\nThe Caltech courseload is enormous and the amount of resources devoted to entrepreneurship is very low, as Caltech is a science school. \n\nIf you really want to work for a FAANG after school, Caltech is good. If you want to learn about starting and running businesses and you got into Stanford, give that serious thought.",

    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI\u2019m a high school senior looking to major in Computer Science for my undergraduate years, and was accepted to both Stanford and Caltech. I\u2019m having a bit of trouble deciding between the two, and would appreciate the input of current Caltech students (preferably in CS). I\u2019m also interested in maybe double majoring in Physics and CS, but the idea might be too ambitious to be feasible, so I\u2019m open to change. Any thoughts on Caltech vs. Stanford for Physics/CS?\n\nI\u2019m looking for more academic reasons rather than social reasons. Thanks.",

A lot of people here complain about the work load but you'll find that everywhere, and depending on your priorities it is always possible to thrive at Caltech in classes and research/extracurriculars.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Caltech *is* a smaller school, and thus when it comes to undergraduate student clubs there will be less options than at a bigger school. This is not really an issue for research due to the huge faculty/student ratio here.",

For example, my interest is in formal verification and programming language theory, which doesn't have a research presence on campus. So, my undergraduate research journey has been a lot more *ad hoc* than it might have been at say, UPenn or CMU.\n\nEven though it's very academically difficult, I'm really glad I ended up at Caltech.",

The Honor Code and collaborative nature.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. The breadth of the Core and CS major requirements. e.g. I really doubt that I would have found a fascination for physics, without Caltech having required me to take two terms of special relativity and electrodynamics as a freshman.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. The theoretical focus. Even though I'm a CS major, my classes are often proof-based. One (non-CS-specific) example was Ma 1a, the mandatory first-quarter freshman calculus class: It spent the first two weeks building up the real numbers (i.e. starting from the Peano axioms). Caltech's theoretical-ness has a particularly special place in my heart, because it's one of the big reasons I recently cared to learn about interactive theorem proving and formal verification (which I love so much that I'm working on a undergraduate research project in Coq).",

            "comment": "It's been a few years since I was at Caltech, so I may not be up-to-date with the major requirements, but when I was there I didn't know anyone who double-majored in CS and physics. CS and math, yes, but not CS and physics. I'm not saying that it can't be done or that nobody did it, but it may be a particularly difficult endeavor. (This may have more to do with scheduling than with academic difficulty.)\n\nOther considerations:\n\n**Academic Stress**\n\nI don't know much about Stanford's CS curriculum, but professors and students who have been to both schools have said that Stanford's undergraduate curriculum is significantly easier and more relaxed than Caltech's. (Professor Lewis taught Chem. 1a in a year at Stanford but in 10 weeks at Caltech, Professor Rangel had to increase the difficulty of Ec. 11 when he moved to Caltech from Stanford because Caltech students were scoring 20% higher on the exams, etc.) One approach isn't necessarily better than the other. For example, learning a lot is cool, but spending 50+ hours/week on schoolwork and feeling like you don't understand what's going on in your classes is not very fun. And you don't always learn more by *trying* to learn more - to use a poor analogy, drinking from a fire hose can result in swallowing less water than drinking from a water fountain.\n\nOne of my Caltech friends visited some of his friends at Stanford and, upon returning, reported to us that they laughed about how easy it was to get A's and spent a lot of their time playing frisbee. Is that not preferable to staying up late writing proofs about matroids and flow networks? Student's choice, I guess.\n\n**Jobs**\n\nI'm somewhat skeptical of the argument that Stanford is noticeably better for CS jobs. Pretty much everyone I knew at Caltech who wanted a high-paying job got one, including non-CS majors. In fact, my adviser informed me that 99% of all Caltech students who applied to Google were accepted, and corrected me when I thought he was speaking rhetorically instead of citing a real statistic. Recruiters from \"top-tier\" CS and finance companies visited campus multiple times a year and made it incredibly easy to apply. I'm sure the same thing happens at Stanford, and I could see Stanford having a better atmosphere for entrepreneurs, but if your goal is to get a FAANG-type job then I wouldn't worry about having attended one school over the other.\n\n**School Atmosphere**\n\nStanford is a big school on a big campus full of many different kinds of people, while Caltech is a small school on a small campus populated almost exclusively by STEM nerds. This can be a huuuge factor in determining what your social life will be like in college. To be honest, I would see this as the biggest consideration when deciding which school to attend, because you'll receive a first-class education at either school. But at Caltech, you're going to be around the same small group of people for four years, and they're all going to be studying science or engineering. Sports and other non-STEM extracurriculars exist, but on a much smaller scale than they do at Stanford. For students who decide they no longer want to study STEM, there aren't nearly as many escape routes as there are at Stanford.\n\nDo those sound like potential issues to you? If so, I would say \"go to Stanford.\" It's much more flexible and forgiving, and you'll have many more options for non-academic activities. Caltech is more hardcore and monastic, and being so comes with upsides and downsides. You want to really know what you'd be getting into before choosing to go there.",

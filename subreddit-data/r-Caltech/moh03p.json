How often are grad students unable to find any slots in any Caltech-subsidised housing, on-campus or otherwise? I understand Pasadena is very expensive, so I just wanted to understand my worst-case scenario.",

My first year as a grad was the first where they started charging for health insurance, only to see the costs go up every year while my stipend stayed the same every year.\n\nDid you know parking was free until they built the lot under the softball fields?",

I'm a grad student at UC now and the union contract gives us free healthcare and guaranteed annual pay increases. UC still absolutely tries to screw the grad students when they think they can get away with, but the union is at least an organized and legally recognized way to push back.",

There's also a huge amount of variability between department and even professor standards that I think it makes getting people so isolated to come together difficult.\n\nMy advisor decided he was tired of writing proposals my second year, and I wound up having to TA about 12 terms and nine different grad classes because it was too late for me to apply for most fellowships. If teaching experience mattered for faculty positions instead of research output I'd have been hired straight to tenure at MIT, lol. My life is good now, but I will definitely say my graduate experience was sub-par.",

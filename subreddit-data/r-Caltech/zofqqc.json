    "postText": "I have a question about attaching a research paper to an application.\n\nIs it worth doing it?\n\nI am an international student. so far my project has been going on for 5 months, it is not finished yet, but i have already presented it to some very good medical professionals. the response has been very positive, i have even received a place in the mentoring program of the high tech foundation in my country.\n\nbut i don't know if i should attach it. i haven't done everything i wanted to yet, because it simply takes time. but on the other hand, it's an important part of me and my story - it touches on a disease that affects part of my family.\n\nplease advise.",

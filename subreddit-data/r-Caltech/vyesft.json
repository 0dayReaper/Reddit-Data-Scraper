    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI wanted to know if it's possible to apply for graduate aerospace engineering programs if my undergrad is in computer science. I m very much interested in computational sciences where I can get to learn more about aerospace and avionics but I also get to use the knowledge I gained during my computer sciences undergrad degree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also wanted to ask what are critical key aspects of grad admission to Caltech. I m looking for aerospace/ computer science engineering majors.\n\nI currently work at CERN where I m involved in research with antiprotons and targets. I m in my last semester of undergraduate studies. I have some key summer research experiences but not any major publications.\n\nMy GPA also kinda sucks around 3.4-3.5/ 4.\n\nI have some major achievements but I don't think they matter just hackathons and stuff.",

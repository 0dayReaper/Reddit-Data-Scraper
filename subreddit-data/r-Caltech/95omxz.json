It actually wasn't that way in the old days.\n\nThe latest style guide even omits the crest for non-formal use.\n\n[http://identity.caltech.edu/faq](http://identity.caltech.edu/faq)\n\nEDIT: looking through some image archives, it looks like my recollection of it being in the 80's is wrong.  I just recall that there were very specific documents that I read when I was an undergrad that talked about the push at the time to more actively enforce the \"Caltech\" spelling versus the use of \"CalTech\" or even all-caps \"CALTECH\"",

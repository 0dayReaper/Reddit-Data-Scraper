    "postText": "Hi! You may know that two (!!) of this year\u2019s MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d Award winners are Caltech alums. We're excited to share that they\u2019ve made themselves available to answer selected questions from the Caltech community, which will be published in the next issue of Caltech Magazine.\n\n[Doris Tsao (BS \u201996)](https://youtu.be/0NNQv4vcpd8), Caltech professor of biology, won for her work on the neural mechanisms underlying primate vision. \n\n[Sarah Stewart (PhD \u201902)](https://youtu.be/XJwswItoo-Q) was recognized for research exploring how celestial collisions give birth to planets.\n\nWe hope you'll post your questions for Doris and Sarah!",

            "comment": "I'm in the campus apartments (2 people, each with their own room) and have zero issues living off of the stipend. The rent is subsidized (comes out to around $850 factoring in power, throw in another $60 if you have a car). The stipend should be the same for all departments. \n\nI expect it'll be a little tighter when I end up going off-campus (although, lottery results cooperating, I hope to delay that because subsidized housing is nice). Overall though, it's a lot better than a lot of PHD stipends I've seen at other universities and it's plenty to live on for me at least. You'll likely need housemates for that to work, though, but I'm used to that so it's whatever.",

I personally have no issue, in large part because I\u2019m in the Caltech housing which is relatively well subsidized and I\u2019m in the four room apartment option (750 USD per month). Now if you want to have a one bedroom apartment outside of Caltech properties in a really nice part of Pasadena, it\u2019s fine but you probably won\u2019t be saving much money during your PhD.",

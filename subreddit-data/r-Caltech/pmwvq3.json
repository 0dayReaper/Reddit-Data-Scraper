I am studying space technologies and I already have some experiences in space design workshops and associations. \nI would very much like to apply to the Caltech Space Challenge and I was just wondering if some of you know how hard it is to get accepted?\nI really hope I could get selected but I don't want to get my hopes up ;)\nThanks to all and have a nice day!",

Although I'm in my first year of aerospace engineering and you're in your final year of masters in physics as you said, I'm starting to think I might be a bit inexperienced haha.  It does look awesome though and would be a golden ticket on your applications for jobs. If you apply, good luck!",

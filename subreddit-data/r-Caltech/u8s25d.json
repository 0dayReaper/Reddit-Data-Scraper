I\u2019d assume JPL people also have access to the listserv but I\u2019m not sure. I saw two posts just today for short-term sublets/leases nearby from people in the Caltech community",

That\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve seen people in the Caltech community reliably post apartment listings, but there may be other social media platforms that the undergrads use regularly for coordinating housing (although my hunch is there\u2019s probably not anything specifically for housing since most undergrads live on campus all 4 years)",

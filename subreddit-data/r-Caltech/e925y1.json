    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a prospective student applying to GALCIT graduate program. I plan to get a master's degree first, the continue to PhD. But it seems that on the application I can only choose my final degree objectives. In my case, should I just choose PhD as final degree objectives? or is there some other place to put the degree I want to apply for?",

There's a lot that goes into admissions, especially when they are only choosing 15-20 students. \n\nBut that said, if you don't put down that you are going for a PhD, you for sure will not get accepted. They don't really want people that just are aiming for the Masters.",

They have MD/PhD programs with USC, UCLA, and the new Kaiser medical school. \n\nHere is the page from the BBE dept describing the programs: https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/academics/graduate-programs/md-phd-program-\n\nI'm not too sure about any business/MBA and PhD combined programs\n\nDM me if you have more questions! I am in the USC program and I'm transitioning into my PhD at Caltech in MedE this year",

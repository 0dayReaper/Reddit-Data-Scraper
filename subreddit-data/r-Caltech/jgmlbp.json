    "postText": "Hey guys,I am an Indian High schooler in 9th Grade right now and I want to apply to caltech in about 3 years and I want to start prepping for my entrance exams. Can anyone help me and tell me what all topics do I need to cover in both Physics and mathematics,Some sources where I can study would be helpful too! Thanks for your time.\n\n\nPS- Is caltech hard to get into? I usually score straight A's but I'm still kinda nervous.",

            "comment": "Honestly, you're still young. Find what interests you and pursue it. Caltech's a top school for science and engineering (especially if you are interested in research/academia). \n\nIn general, excellency in school and standardized tests is a good start...but that's not going to differentiate you. Neither is \"participating\" in every club under the sun. If there are a few clubs/extracurricular pursuits that really resonate with you, follow those with a passion (though feel free to drop something if you lose interest...your feelings will change!). \n\nIf, when the time comes to apply, your body of work and interests line up and you think Caltech is a good fit (make sure you visit, if possible)...by all means, apply.   \n\n\nNote: when you say you are Indian, do you mean studying in India, or of Indian origin? The application process is a bit different for non-US folks and most of what I've written is for US high schoolers. Some of it will apply to foreign applicants as well though.",

But yeah like the other comment, do focus on making yourself well-rounded but doing things other than just getting good grades. Do a sport (that you could get recruited by Caltech for) if you can, work your way to be in charge of a club or start your own, participate in your community with free tutoring or other community services, and so on. These things should be things you are passionate about, and they are what make you stand out and show your personality.",

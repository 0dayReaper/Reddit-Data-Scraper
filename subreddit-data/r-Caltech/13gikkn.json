    "postText": "I\u2019m from the UK. Currently ending my second year at university studying astrophysics and looking into graduate options. I\u2019m predicted to have a first class degree (&lt;70%) overall and I\u2019m doing a placement year next year which involves research in additive manufacturing for satellite components in Australia. Do you think my stats and this year will be good enough for caltech? What more should I do to help with admission into a phd programme for astrophysics?",

            "comment": "Not enough information here.  The degree class doesn't carry any weight in the US.   \n You'd probably need to be in the top few percent at a typical Russell Group university, maybe top 10% at Oxford or Cambridge, and top student over a several year timespan at a typical non-Russell Group institution to be competitive for admission to the top US graduate programs.  You'd also need reference letters that indicate you're a really strong research student.  Top US places are significantly more competitive for graduate admission than Oxford/Cambridge/Durham.",

But how important is the name of the university for grad school admission (albeit life sciences). I study at a good med school in my country, but I don't think anyone in the US knows its name. So should I not target top American universities at all? If I can, how do I compensate (except research, I know that is important)? Nobody gives a straight answer, hoping to get one now.",

Is it simply a function of Yale chemistry or Stanford MechE receiving that many more applicants per spot from around the world than Oxford chemistry or Cambridge MechE?\n\n^1 By percentages the most competitive UK undergraduate schools are places most non-Brits have never heard of, like Warwick.",

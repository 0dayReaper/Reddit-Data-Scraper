I think it's pretty reasonable to go once every couple weeks or so if you're into that.\n\n3- No, as far as I know / can tell from past admissions statistics.",

I believe so - from statistics a couple years ago just a little under 50% of current students identified as Asian and a substantially percentage of that identify as Indian.  It\u2019s a small school so I don\u2019t think there are many clubs specific to Indian culture but there are some events throughout the years and several really good Indian dance teams.\n\n2. Sharing an Uber with friends or having a friend who drives is the best way to visit LA. A few people visit every weekend, though I think the norm is more like 1-2 times a month. Caltech can get pretty busy and it\u2019s all about the activities you prioritize.\n\n3. Not at the moment I believe ",

The workload is heavy, so time might be limited. Also, lots of students don't have cars, but nowadays, you can take a Lyft/Uber or split a Lyft/Uber with friends. \n\n3. No, I don't think so.",

    "postText": "I would like to whether it's possible to know which textbook is used in a specific Caltech class. For example I would put the course number for calculus and it would tell me that the textbook used is Apostol. If I\u2019m not wrong the Caltech's Official Textbook Store used to do this, but nowadays when I access the site it simply throws an error message.\nThank you for the help.\nThank you for the help.",

If a class isn't on there, feel free to message me (or some other current student here) - chances are I either know what book the class uses or know somebody who does. ",

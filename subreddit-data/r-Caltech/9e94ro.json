Would be great for Caltech undergrads or grad students.  $1600/month for both rooms. I live in the master bedroom. the kitchen, living room, dining area is shared.  There is a beautiful yard out back and garage for extra storage.  Internet and water included.  Electric bill is separate.  Feel free to PM any questions or request for pictures.  ",

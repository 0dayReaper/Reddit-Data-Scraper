    "postText": "Everyone at Caltech talks about how Nate Lewis was swindled from winning the nobel prize. Is this even true? What is the source for this? Did Nate say this? Even if Nate said this I wouldn't really trust him...\n\nI literally can't find any info about this online. The only explanation I've heard at Caltech was that there was this paper that won the nobel prize and he was the 4th author so they gave it to this first 3 and the he was left out because he was the 4th (nobel prizes can only be awarded to 3 people). If this is true, what paper are they talking about? What was the year that Nate could have possibly won the award?",

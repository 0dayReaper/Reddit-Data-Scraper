Administration talks a big game with preventing student hazing in housing, but turns a blind eye to the fact that core classes are design to break students. Almost everyone comes out of core thinking less of themselves, calling themselves failures, feeling depressed and hopeless about GPAs/their future\u2026 after I completed my freshman year, I strongly considered dropping out because if I was barely scraping passes, getting Ds for my shadow grades, how was I possibly going to be successful in letter-graded classes? I was giving up on my grad school dreams, on every dream that motivated me to apply to Caltech in the first place. \n\nThe freshman core curriculum is cruel to students. It contributes to severe, wide-spread imposter syndrome and the deterioration of students\u2019 mental health. The counseling center is more overrun than ever with undergraduate students who are having mental health issues due to their experiences at Caltech. Core desperately needs to be overhauled.",

Many capable students have committed to other schools instead of Caltech due to its notorious requirements. It\u2019s yield rate is less than 40 percent. Most Caltech graduates describe their 4 years at Caltech as pain. Too much academic pressure. No appreciation for humanities. It is US version of IIT. Pathetic!",

My understanding is that most people committing to other schools are doing so because they don't want the tiny 1000 person STEM school college experience, not just because it's too difficult here. Most people that are admitted here also get into a few other top schools, so it's a relatively easy choice to make if you don't like the small school culture. I also think our yield rate has gone up a bit, somewhere around 50% recently, but it is still abnormally low among Peer Institutions.",

Historically, it\u2019s been guaranteed housing for four years, which is a major selling point for admissions. Caltech definitely is expanding class size, but they\u2019re doing it to the detriment of the students they\u2019re admitting. \n\nAt the start of this year, housing had 70 students, which they were contractually required to house, that they did not have beds for in any residence. And as the smaller (~240) classes of 2023 and 2024 graduate, Caltech will make this problem worse by continuing to admit larger classes. For REA of 2027 alone, approximately 250 students have been admitted. Yes, these students won\u2019t all commit to Caltech, but the number admitted in the REA round is larger than it has been for previous classes. Caltech has already permanently converted the Marks and Braun singles to doubles, and there aren\u2019t any dorm rooms left on campus that they can legally convert from singles to doubles or doubles to triples. There certainly isn\u2019t any talk of constructing additional residences.\n\nI agree that a larger class size would be beneficial, but Caltech hasn\u2019t laid the framework to support it. We are completely out of space, and rather than address the issue, Caltech is allowing students to face the stresses of housing insecurity, which is known to have negative impacts on educational performance. I\u2019m realizing I\u2019ve made a lot of comments on this post - what I truly wish would change at Caltech is the normalization of stress, and lies that this much stress is somehow beneficial to our development as students.",

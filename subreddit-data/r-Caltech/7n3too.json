Also many relatively cheap places to eat on Lake Street or Colorado, and a Target a bit further away (though still within walking distance). I knew of some professors at Caltech who didn't have cars. Unfortunately the lightrail station for the Gold Line to downtown LA or Arcadia is a bit of a walk though.",

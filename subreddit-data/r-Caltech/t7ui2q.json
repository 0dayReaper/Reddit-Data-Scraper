    "postText": "I'm more specifically wondering about the one-bedroom apartments on 180 &amp; 188 S Catalina Ave or the two-bedroom apartments at 229 S Wilson Ave. I'd love to get an idea of how they look like inside (and if floor plans exist).\n\nAdditionally (in case someone happens to already know), I noticed that \"lease properties are rented only to registered Caltech graduate students\". Are you unable to live with your wife/husband, or am I misunderstanding this statement?",

With the off-campus properties you lease the entire unit and family can also occupy it.",

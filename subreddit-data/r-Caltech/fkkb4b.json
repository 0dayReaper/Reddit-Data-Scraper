    "postText": "Hey, I\u2019m a 16 year old student in Singapore studying at ACS (Independent) and am in my first year of my IB program. I am aiming for a 44 in IB and 1550 in SATs. If you are wondering why I am aiming so high, in 2019, our school had 24 45s and an average of 41.7 points. However, at the end of my school life, I am required to undergo 2 years of military service and return back for reservist training for 2 weeks every year as well as rare random call ups that require me to go back for a day or two that decrease in frequency rapidly. The government will ensure these callbacks will not interfere in exams, my study for them or any other research programs i am attending. However, will my asking for deferment affect my application in any way?",

Also, I know a few people at Caltech who have had to do mandatory military service and seem to have had no problems with that interrupting their school work. Just be sure to keep your brain sharp during those two years - you don't want to come to Caltech and have forgotten everything you learnt in high school! Best of luck with your studies and application in the future :)",

I know a current student who's Singaporean-- he has these so-called \"exit permits\" for four years, so he doesn't need to do the once-a-year trips for the duration of his university studies. If you want to apply, you definitely should; good luck OP!",

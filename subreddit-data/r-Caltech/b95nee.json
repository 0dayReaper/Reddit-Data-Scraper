    "postText": "I was accepted for the 2019 surf. I am a International student and I wanted to stay in campus. Should I choose a single/double or a suite-style? Also, is there someone here willing to share a place off campus between days 10 and 18 of June (a week before the summer housing opens)?",

The singles and the doubles in the houses will vary in terms of surrounding noise level and culture. With the suite-style living in Bechtel, you will have your own small single, and share a bathroom and common area with your suitemates. ",

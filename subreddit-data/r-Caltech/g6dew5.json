Have you felt Caltech has done a good job of that? Do you think they treated First Generation/Low Income students fairly? International Students? It's sad to see some elite schools either don't care about their FGLI population or are too administratively challenged to do so.",

They told us that we could turn our finals in online and were really encouraging us to go home early for spring break while not mentioning that we might not be coming back. Then a couple days later after a bunch of people had already left they told us that we were going online and we needed to be packed up and out  of our rooms within a week. \n\nOutside of that I'd say their response has been pretty good. They have been doing well with keeping us regularly updated with what is currently happening and their plans looking ahead.",

You'll need to take another frosh hum to make up for it (maybe the same one to replace the grade, again not sure how that works). It's certainly not the end of the world, and as a frosh it's not even going to affect your GPA. I dropped a frosh hum because I knew I was going to do badly in it, and I'm on track with my hums at this point. I think the biggest thing to do right now is to try not to obsess over it, and enjoy your first break.",

If you only passed a certain amount you might be required to talk to UASH or the Deans at minimum, but it should be okay. They would let you know if that's the case. ",

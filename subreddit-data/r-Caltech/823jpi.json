    "postText": "I wasn't the best student in undergrad. I went to NYU and got a BS in biology with a 3.2 GPA.... I had some issues back at home. I also had a 2.8 slump for 1 year, but tried to finished with a 3.861 GPA the next semester, so overall was a 3.2...... \nMy GRE was pretty bad too- 316. \n\nI know it's below Caltech standards. \nThe only good things I have are - a published paper in Nature. I worked 50 hours per week, slept in lab, and had help from a phd mentor. The PI was also understanding and he let me sleep in lab. \n\nI was named 5thco-author for the paper, with 9 other authors lol. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to go to Computation and Neural Systems PhD because I like the faculty research. I like reading their papers. I have some ideas to contribute to my own. But I am worried about the course work to survive. I am worried that I might wash away. \n\nBut most likely, I won't make it to PhD, especially at Caltech. I know its a huge long shot. \nI barely have the physics, computer science, or math background to make it.\nMy bio background is sufficient, but really shakey and bad.\nHere is what I took in undergrad: \n\n* Physics: Mechanics, Intro Electricity &amp; Magnetism, Waves &amp; Optics\n* Computer Science: Intro to Python, Object Oriented C++\n* Bio: Bio 1, Bio 2, organism physiology, anatomy, genetics, molecular development, grad level neuroscience, grad level tissue culture and engineering \n* Math: calc 1, calc 2, calc 3, linear, differential, and numerical methods\n* Chemistry: chem 1, chem 2, orgo 1, orgo 2, [lecture and labs], biochem 1, biochem 2, analytical, physical chemistry, \n \nI was thinking about going to do a mathematics and computer science masters to try to overcome the slump and to catch up. \n\nBut if I do get a 4.0 GPA &lt;kinda long shot but one can dream&gt; on my master, I was wondering if my undergrad GPA will still weigh me down. \n\nAny thoughts? Any advice? Any career suggestions? ",

What about caltech do you not get from the right PI at anywhere?\n\nI ask because personalities can sometimes be _very_ strong, and it seems to be viewed as a bug worth the features. Do you want a very involved advisor? Lots of pi's here rely on grad students to need them less than would be the case elsewhere.",

The applicants to CNS are quite strong, but it's also such a specialized program that professors can look beyond traditional metrics.\n\nSomething to think about regarding a masters: yes, it can boost your reported GPA, but it won't necessarily move you along with a PhD program at Caltech. My roommate first year already had his masters in EE from MIT (wrote a thesis and everything) and he had the exact same coursework and exam requirements as people fresh out of undergrad. The only difference is that his advisor was more cavalier about saying \"yeah, I don't care what grades you get in these classes.\"",

But I felt like there were classes that I deserved an A or A-, but the professors gave me a C+ just to spite me. &lt;I'm talking about getting a 92 on the first midterm, and the professor gives me a 70 on the next one while he gave everyone else a 91&gt;.

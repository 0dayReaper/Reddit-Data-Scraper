I am shocked at how little response I got after applying for a number of positions.  \n\nI am interested in hearing from others experiences. What are some successful strategies? Is there anything that I can do at this point for the coming summer?\n\nAlternatively, If you do not do anything in the summer, I am worried about its effect in future job search or grad school apps.",

            "comment": "In my experience, yes, the brand makes a huge difference.\n\nThe thing is, Caltech does a poor job at helping students know how to apply. For instance, at my first job out of school there had been some students who showed up to the interview barefoot. Seriously. It's an extreme example but illustrates how little the students know how to play the interview game.",

The career fair is a good place to go and the nice thing is there aren\u2019t that many people so you are more likely to be remembered (if you make a good impression)",

But I've run across a number of other engineers in industry who thought it was a UC school or a trade school.  It's certainly not a majority of people, but it's happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other advice in this thread is all generally applicable good advice, whether the interviewer has heard of Caltech or not.",

            "comment": "Caltech name is huge in the science and tech. Don't think otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as u/DovidBobson mentioned, make sure you're acting professional. I've been to the career fair many many times and many students show up looking completely out of place and not ready for the real world.\n\nAdvice: \n\n* Wear professional clothes. Make sure they're cleaned and pressed (do NOT show up with a wrinkled shirt).\n* Men I prefer with a jacket, but shirt and tie can get the job done. Women have more flexibility, but just make sure it's professional looking.\n* Good hygiene matters.\n* Consider getting a haircut and maybe toning down any hair coloring.\n* Clean your glasses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're applying online, always try and find alumni that work at the same company to work it from their angle. Reach out to them on LinkedIn or through direct email (on top of the standard online job portal). Also, make sure your resume and cover letter are well-written and catered to that company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, if you're just applying now, it may be a bit late for this summer. But not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps.",

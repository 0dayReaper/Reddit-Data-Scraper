    "postText": "Sorry to fill the sub with another one of these posts. Currently I'm leaning towards Caltech over CMU, but I have a few nagging concenrs I'd like to get y'all's opinion on. Obviously, I\u2019m unable to visit either school before I have to make the choice.\n\nQuick background on me (skip to the numbered part if you don\u2019t care): My primary interest is in Robotics, I\u2019d likely take additional classes in EE/ME/Robotics/CDS regardless of where I go. On CS, I\u2019d say I\u2019m slightly more practically oriented than theoretical (in subject area, not looking for an SWE degree), but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not excited about PLT/Category theory, cryptography, or the mathematics of distributed systems.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve been able to find so far, Caltech offers challenging CS courses, if admittedly challenging in a different way than CMU. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of the core requirements and lack of AP/college credit; some quick math showed that ***40% of all credits at Caltech will be spent taking core requirements***, (assuming 5 classes for 12 quarters averaging 9.7 credits each) compared to 23% at CMU. I\u2019d be curious to hear more about the value of that.\n\nMy main concern is about the depth/breadth of CS classes and the variety/availability of research positions in CS/Robotics.\n\n1. Did/does the core requirements get in the way of other classes you wanted to take? Do you plan on doing anything with the things learned in core classes? CS Alumni: Do you wish you had taken more CS or more other stuff?\n2. Have you ever felt that a CS course lacked depth/breadth? How theoretical vs. practical are the curriculum offerings? Alumni: did you feel prepared for industry work, and what do you do?\n   1. My concern stems from [posts like this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-Caltech/answer/Jessica-Su) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sn9lg/where_should_i_go_for_undergrad_cs_berkeley_or/c4ffi82/). Quote: \"Now that I've spent some time at Stanford, I think my Caltech experience was limiting.  There were entire fields of CS that I hadn't heard of before coming to Stanford (like programming languages and HCI).  Also we didn't have a lot of systems classes, so when I got to Stanford I had to take a lot of breadth requirements that most students placed out of.\"\n   2. Looking at the course catalog, most bases seem to be covered. From the best I can tell, notable omissions include compilers/optimization, possibly reinforcement learning, and several courses not offered this year, without any information about their return.\n3. I know there are ample research opportunities at Caltech, and that they are fairly easy to get. My concern is the availability of positions in things I\u2019m interested in that involve meaningful work. This stems from the small size of the CS department, combined with anecdotes like [this one](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-Caltech/answer/Martin-Michelsen): \u201cIt seemed to me that there were plenty of opportunities for research, but not many of them were pure CS; most opportunities were collaborations with other departments.\u201d How much choice is there in research opportunities?\n4. How common is it to take graduate courses?\n5. (for alumni) Has core actually helped you in your career? What have you used it for? Has the Caltech \u201cnetwork\u201d helped you at all?\n\n**TL;DR:** 1. How much does core interfere with work in your major? 2. Does the smaller offering in CS courses reflect lack of depth in topics? 3. How much choice is there in research opportunities?",

            "comment": "I'll comment on a subset of your points.\n\n1. The size of Caltech Core is misleading. There are two main parts: 1) your frosh schedule is essentially locked in, as you have to take Ma 1abc, Ph 1abc, Ch 1ab, and some other frosh classes people sometimes put off like Bi 1, menu class, Ch 3a, and so on. From the perspective of a CS person, you probably won't learn anything \"\"\"useful\"\"\" here, but having been exposed to rigorous math, physics, and chem is just generally useful core knowledge. Especially if you want to do research... 2) the hum requirement, you have to take 12 total hums, one per term. Two of these are frosh hums, which honestly feel like high school English classes and kind of suck. But the hum requirement can also be satisfied by: language classes, econ classes, social science classes, philosophy classes, and of course English / history classes...honestly only 3/12 of the hums I took were at all annoying. The other 9/12 were extremely enjoyable and a welcome break from my more difficult STEM classes.\n2. \"several courses not offered this year, without any information about their return\"\u2014due to its small size, Caltech has a lot of classes which happen every other year. This is not clearly advertised so it's hard to distinguish between \"never offered\" and \"offered regularly every other year\". If you have specific classes in mind, you can ask current students to check the TQFRs and see when the class was previously offered.\n3. Anecdotally: \"Pure CS\" research opportunities, as in computer science theory, are relatively rare but not impossible to get. Other CS research is more common. Also \"collaborations with other departments\" doesn't have to be a bad thing, that's a huge part of Caltech's (CS) philosophy. ([https://www.ist.caltech.edu/csx/](https://www.ist.caltech.edu/csx/))\n4. Depends on the subject. There are (almost) no restrictions on grad courses, so just consider it an additional part of the catalog. \n5. \"Has the Caltech \u201cnetwork\u201d helped you at all?\" Yes, but also, obviously. Wherever you go, you are networking at least a bit. \n\n\"My primary interest is in Robotics, I\u2019d likely take additional classes  in EE/ME/Robotics/CDS regardless of where I go. On CS, I\u2019d say I\u2019m  slightly more practically oriented than theoretical (in subject area,  not looking for an SWE degree), but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not excited  about PLT/Category theory, cryptography, or the mathematics of  distributed systems.\" I know people like this at Caltech. They major in CS, do robotics clubs / work in robotics labs, and due to the flexibility of the CS major, have the freedom to explore random other stuff they're interested in. What you've described here is totally doable and won't be inhibited by core. \n\np.s. if you want to learn \"\"\"category theory\"\"\" take Ma 5a",

When I said \"Pure CS\" I was trying to refer not necessarily to CS theory, but rather something that would fit in a CS journal or fit in a sidebar category [here](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/theory), rather than doing CS supporting work for another lab. I think you're saying that at Caltech those lines are deliberately blurred, and I see the value of that approach.\n\nWhen you say that some research opportunities are \"rare but not impossible to get,\" what  does that look like? I know at some schools faculty get undergraduates \"applying\" to their labs, and they interview based on GPA, classes taken, and prior work in the field, similar to a tech company.

            "comment": "1. Sometimes, yes. However, since core is frontloaded, it became less of an issue towards the end of my degree. I enjoyed the hums and social science courses but that tends to be very person-dependent. I used more of core than I expected in part because it allowed me to take courses outside of cs such as astrobiology that I got a lot out of. \n\n2.  On average the courses had appropriate depth although there were outliers.  The curriculum tends heavily towards theory (see: cs21 and cs38, probably the two hardest major-required courses). Caltech has a tendency to push theory at you and expect you to do the practical aspects on your own time. As an alum, Caltech alone doesn't prepare you well enough for routine swe work and you should expect to do 1-2 industry internships to get that experience. \n\n3. Since your interest is in robotics JPL and the mechE department have most of that research and it is accessible to undergrads. Pure-cs research requires a little more work afaik.\n\n4. It's required to take some amount of courses considered graduate-level (100-level). 200-level courses are somewhat rarer for undergrads to take. \n\n5. I appreciated the analytical aspects of core a lot and the general skillset it teaches is worthwhile even if core itself could be improved. That much is broadly usable. The Caltech name and network is wonderful and opens a ton of doors.",

            "comment": "Hey. I was in the exact same situation as you (CMU SCS vs Caltech) a couple of weeks ago and I eventually chose Caltech. I'll list the reasons why I chose Caltech below. They might not necessarily answer your questions but it might give you some different things to consider that maybe you haven't thought of before.\n\n1. Caltech's core curriculum, although it may seem unnecessary, I think is very important. I'm interested in learning about different sciences, and I think that Caltech's core curriculum does that really well. I am also planning to do CS, but I think that knowing about all sciences in some sort of depth will help you everywhere you go. You'll understand and be able to collaborate with a lot more people. Collaboration is really big in today's world. Like you said robotics and creating a good functioning robot is not just purely CS, there are a lot of other subjects that also need to be known, yk? Also the hum classes. I've heard that mostly it's nice because people get  a little break from doing so much STEM work. I mean everybody who attends Caltech obviously loves STEM but sometimes it's nice to take a break and the hums allow students that.\n2. I'm not too sure about the lack of CS classes but I know that people have been mostly satisfied. Also people say that internship questions are more theoretical based stuff so people have said that they don't really have to prep for internship interviews because Caltech prepares them well by their theory-based curriculum. Also people have said that if you want to pursue a Masters or PhD  Caltech prepares you really well for that.\n3. Also not to sure about the lack of CS research, but I know they do have career fairs and students typically get really good opportunities there. I've talked to only 5 current Caltech students and 3 of them have internships at Facebook this summer (unless corona cancels it). I mean its def not a good sample size, but I mean 3 Facebook internships in a class of 200 kids isn't bad at all. And if you don't get an internship freshman year then you can do the SURF program. Maybe it won't be pure CS but the fact that you can get research so early puts you ahead of a lot of kids. Plus the competition for research isn't bad so you should be able to get a good project to work on.\n4. Caltech is on the quarter system and CMU is on the semester system. Idk which one you prefer or if you really prefer any but that's another thing that you can keep in mind.\n5. CMU does have great oppertunities no doubt. I've talked to a couple of people and they said they like CMU because of the research opportunities and good name in the CS industry. But so does Caltech sooo\n6. JPLLLLLLL. lol that's really big plus for Caltech imo\n7. I'm also from California so staying in California is ideal for me. Also apparently CMU is hella depressing whereas Caltech is in Pasadena which is a very nice area.\n8. Idk if you have already but attending the Caltech webinar things is good to learn more. \n9. Also Caltech has hella Noble Laureates. I think that's SUPER cool and exciting. I'm def doing CS but I really do want to learn about other subjects so having people that are literal experts in their fields is a big plus. Also yk you can get so much clout hahah by saying youre like friends with a Noble Laureate or if you work in one of their labs soooo. Caltech has like 70ish while CMU only has like 10ish\n10. Caltech is a small school and that's something I like too. Also it's all STEM kids yk which I like a lot because there's mainly gonna be STEM talk and I like that. Plus USC and UCLA aren't too far away so I mean you can always visit those school if you want more parties.\n\nSide note: I haven't done much research about CMU.  I applied to both RD so Caltech came in early March whereas CMU came in late March. During the time period between Caltech's acceptance and CMU's acceptance I thought a lot about Caltech so it really grew on me. Then when CMU came in I def did consider it but I was already kinda set on Caltech. Also I've obviously been brainwashed by Caltech cuz people are trying to convince me to go there. Also the information I've collected is from a couple of students so it might not represent the majority of what other Caltech students are doing/feeling.\n\nAlso one thing that my parents always say is that a CS degree is a CS degree regardless of where you come from. However, the research, internships, projects, networking, essentially experience is what will carry you through. And also a lot of people say that their school didn't really prepare them well for internships. It's the experience of actually being an intern that helps prepare you for the workforce. You can't really go wrong in your decision, but imo Caltech is such a golden opportunity to not only learn from the best but also be surrounded by the best of the best.\n\nAnyways these are my thoughts. They are heavily pro Caltech lollol but hopefully it helps.",

            "comment": "I think your percentages might be inaccurate for core classes. To break down a bit:\n\nCaltech requires ~99 units (12 classes, 3 math, 3 physics, 2 chem, 1 bio, 1 menu, 1 chem lab, 1 additional lab) of STEM courses that aren't required by your major. They also require 108 units (12 classes, split up between humanities and social sciences) of humanities courses. \n\nLooking at CMU's CS major requirements, they have (to the best of my interpretation): 2-3 math courses that match Caltech's core math courses and 4 courses outside CS in general science/engineering. This is 6-7 courses in STEM, not sure how units work at CMU. They also require 63 units (which I think is 7 courses) in the humanities. \n\nHowever, these counts are a lot closer than you'd expect once you factor in that CMU is a semester school. This averages out to 1 STEM and 1 Hum per Caltech term, and a little under that (.75 and .83) per CMU semester. \n\nTo be fair to the CS major at Caltech though, they also require 18 units of more difficult STEM courses (normally done in the physics department), which brings up the numbers a bit on Caltech. There are also some more freeform requirements in Math, Engineering, and CS for Caltech which I think would probably be covered by CMU's CS major requirements. \n\nThis answer kinda dragged on a bit and didn't get to the percentages I was thinking of, but I hope it helps.",

Go to Caltech if you plan on pursuing academia, using science to discover groundbreaking tech, and/or really value the personal feel.\n2. Go to CMU if you want to focus on being a software engineer. I've heard Caltech CS students also very frequently get jobs at top companies - in fact, [this](https://www.ivyachievement.com/computer-science-rankings/) source says that Caltech is the best in terms of job recruitment/salary for CS - and the flexibility at Tech really lets you choose what you want to do with CS in the future.\n\nMy conclusion is that you should go to Caltech unless you really, really value the location or interacting with students from within the humanities. I'm currently choosing between Berkeley EECS and Caltech, which is a somewhat similar decision to what you're making. Currently leaning towards Caltech too.\n\nBest of luck in deciding - you can't go wrong with either option!",

When I was there, people interested in CS took the intro CS series in freshman year and a series on computability and automata in sophomore year. The intro CS series was heavy on programming, but many Caltech CS courses are more theoretical. The CS courses at Caltech didn't and still don't offer great breadth. However, I did take a compilers course because there happened to be a prof who did compiler research. He left several years after I graduated, and as far as I know, there is no compilers ocurse anymore. \n\nMany Caltech students probably improve their programming skills on their own. That's also not unusual for CS students everywhere. In general, Caltech students do well at getting hired by top tech firms.

I didn't end up choosing CMU so I can't say for them, but our CS department head literally emails undergraduates on behalf of professors who want assistants. You should probably talk to CMU students to see what its like on their side.\n\n\\- To point 2a: Caltech's department is pretty small. However, I feel like 4 years of school is pretty small. Even if I was in a much larger school, I doubt anyone would have the ability to explore CS extremely thoroughly. However, Caltech is really good at fundamentals. Though there may not be as many CS courses as other schools, the foundations in those classes are extremely rigorous and help me be able to learn more niche material on my own.\n\n\\- 4. There is less of a undergrad/grad distinction at Caltech (not sure about CMU). I have been in multiple classes with grad students. I would say it is extremely common as a CS major. Caltech is so small (professor wise and student wise) that instead of teaching varying levels of the same thing, one thorough class is offered. Caltech's core is really strong for reasons such as this. I kind of like that there aren't \"watered down\" versions of classes for undergraduates because if I learn something I'd rather learn it thoroughly the first time, but it also means a decent amount of work! (Also, I'm sure there are differing opinions on this.)\n\n\\-- other things to keep in mind --\n\nSince your class will not have the luxury of visiting campuses, I wanted to share some on campus things that helped me decide.\n\n\\- When I visited Caltech, the admissions office picked me up from the airport, helped me store my luggage so I could roam campus, people went out of their way to welcome me (my prefrosh lanyard was a dead giveaway), the admissions office paid for my meals and my host personally gave me a tour. At CMU, the admissions office told me they did not have the space to store everyone's luggage so they stored no one's luggage. Lugging my sleeping bag and belongings across campus all day was definitely not fun and I remember walking into the city to buy food with other CMU prospectives. There was nothing wrong with the way CMU did things, but Caltech's approach was really impactful in contrast.\n\n\\- At Caltech, the community seemed a lot stronger during Prefrosh Experience. Collaboration is heavily emphasized and the House system definitely reinforces friendships - people's doors were open for conversation and it was definitely a lively aptmosphere. At CMU, my hosts mentioned that it is hard to make more friends outside of an initial group or club, with a large school and grading curves creating competition.\n\n\\- The weather at Caltech is very nice. It seems kind of minor, but I definitely feel happier when its nice and sunny outside even if I'm still studying all day.",

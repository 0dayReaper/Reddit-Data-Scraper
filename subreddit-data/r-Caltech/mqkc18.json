I am looking mostly for friends and to get to know other students on campus, as well as any resources you might recommend for me as a new student.\n\nIf you are also an incoming student in the Geological &amp; Planetary Sciences Division please feel free to message me if you\u2019d like to be friends, as I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be seeing a lot of each other in our classes anyways.",

There's also one for incoming students that was originally just physics but now I think it's everything (the link is in a previous post on this subreddit). Or I can probably send you a link to join? (Idk how discord works really...) \n\nI'm also an incoming grad student and I'd like to get to know more people! I'm not in geosciences but feel free to message me if you want to talk!",

The link to the one that used to be just for physics students is no longer working. \n\nI\u2019m an incoming Chemical Engineering PhD student (with research interests related to atmospheric chemistry) and I\u2019d love the opportunity to connect with other grad students from Caltech :)",

I used to coach a softball team for international students who had never thrown a baseball before (now and then we'd get lucky and snag a few cricket players). Some teams are also made up of large research groups or undergrad houses.",

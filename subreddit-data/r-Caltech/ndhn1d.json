    "postText": "Have non-Physics (specifically a main stream of Engineering) undergraduate students who did a lot of independent reading, took electives in and audited Physics/math courses (and did well in them) been admitted into the graduate program? Or is there a strict, \"unsaid\" policy for the pre-requisite being a Physics undergraduate degree?",

My girlfriend also came in as applied physics (with an undergrad degree in materials science), and was able to transfer into the physics department. \n\nBottom line is, no, your degree need not say \u201cPhysics\u201d to get into physics here - as long as your research experience is strong and you\u2019re a good fit, they\u2019ll give you a chance. The fact you\u2019ve taken and done well in physics courses is going to help you as well.",

            "comment": "I was more on the materials science side, but keep in mind Caltech is a pretty small school and most professors take students from a variety of departments. What your PhD research was on and who it was with matters a lot more than the department you get it from. If you think you'd be a much stronger candidate for a department your same target faculty take students from, it might be a better strategy to apply via there (so long as you can stomach their required classes vs physics). \n\nAs an example, my advisor often took students from materials, applied physics, physics, and chemistry. Materials was definitely the easiest department to get into.",

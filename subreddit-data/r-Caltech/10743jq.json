    "postText": "Got rejected REA from Caltech. It\u2019s definitely my dream school so I want to give it another try and transfer. To transfer, Caltech requires an entrance exam that seems quite difficult. Is it worth it for me to spend a significant amount of time studying for the entrance exam if I want to have a shot at getting in, or are the transfer acceptance rates way too low and random?",

            "comment": "Caltech accepts about 5 transfers a year from a pool of a few hundred. Most of those are from one of the 3:2 programs we support at a few other schools. Also, it\u2019s not just the tests that get you in. From what I\u2019ve heard from transfers, you need a more or less perfect score on those exams to be considered. While I don\u2019t want to brutally kill your dreams, your odds are not great. Caltech accepts about 500 freshman each year (out of which ~235 enroll), but it\u2019s a dream school for probably far more people than that, which means some dreams just aren\u2019t going to work out. \n\nOne other thing though, Caltech is just a school. Sure, it\u2019s relatively unique, but you can replicate most aspects of it at several other places. It\u2019s also not the perfect place that admissions makes it out to be. If you are that determined to come here, you can also try for grad school here in a few years.",

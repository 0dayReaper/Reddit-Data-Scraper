    "postText": "I am a prefrosh admitted under EA. I have a few choices for college and have a few questions to help narrow down my selection. Feel free to answer as many or as few as you want:\n\n1. When do you usually sleep? On average, how many hours of sleep do you get each night?\n\n2. What are the most active clubs on campus, especially pertaining to astronomy or aerospace? The amount of student organizations at Caltech seem significantly lower than most schools and only seem to be dwindling... does it feel that way?\n\n3. How much background do freshman classes assume you have? Is it possible to do well with a below-average high school foundation?\n\n4. Why did you choose Caltech? Was it worth it? If you have to cite a single reason for staying away from Caltech, what is it?\n\n5. How are the humanities? Students I've talked to described the humanities as \"science lite,\" that economics is mostly game theory and history deals with the history of science. How true is that? Are there really no \"real\" and more traditional history classes?\n\n6. How detrimental/ beneficial is Caltech for grad school admissions, especially for a middling student? Does Caltech accept its own undergrads to their grad school?\n\n7. If you had the choice between MIT and Caltech, given everything you have experienced and ignoring weather, what choice would you make today? If that choice is between Stanford and Caltech, which would you go with?\n\n8. What do you feel differentiates the House System at Caltech from residential colleges or dorms with strong dorm cultures at other institutions?\n\nThank you!\n",

            "comment": "First of all, make sure you visit campus and talk to some people in person. For me, campus visits made the decision very clear.\n\n1. Entirely depends on the person, your major, your desire for a social life. Some people go to sleep at 10pm, many go to sleep at 4-6am.\n2. Compared to other universities I have been at, serious clubs are non-existent. Sports-for-casual-fun exist, and some people take part in cultural/religious organizations, but its a very small part of campus life compared to anywhere else. But the house system makes up for that by somewhat grouping people by interest in specific activities and for me that was enough.\n3. It is assumed you have extensive background in math, reasonable background in physics, minor background in chemistry and biology. The assumed mathematical preparation is the only one that is a significant outlier from peer institutions in my experience. Doing well with below-average high school foundation is possible with the exception of math; lack of math background will make everything a big struggle.\n4. I chose it because I loved the house system and social life when I visited. It was the only place I visited where I truly felt like I was surrounded by people I liked and found universally interesting. I also liked the excellent opportunities for research and general academic reputation. In retrospect, all of these positives remain and for me personally it was worth it. Biggest reason to stay away from Caltech is it is a huge gamble - some people do well, but many do very poorly and there are very few resources to help you if you for some reason fall behind.\n5. Econ is definitely essentially what other universities would call applied math/statistics. There are a few serious english, foreign language, history, social science and business classes for the subset of the population who are interested in a real humanities class. Your choice within each of those subjects will be limited though.\n6. Caltech is the best place you can be at for future grad school prospects if you are an excellent student (top \\~25% of the student body) and mediocre otherwise. That said, research opportunities on campus are better than anywhere else Ive seen, regardless of how good of a student you are.\n7. If I was making the decision now for my high-school self: I would go to MIT because there is nothing I can think of that Caltech offers that MIT doesn't, and MIT has a much better support system and cares marginally more for students who are struggling so there is something of a safety net. I would not go to Stanford because it does not appear to me to provide the same level of science education (impressions, I have not gone there personally) and the culture is not comparable, or at least the part of the culture that I care about.",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t answer all of these but I\u2019ll answer the ones I can speak to personally. \n\n1. I know some people with wack sleep schedules but I personally go to sleep between 10pm-midnight most nights and get 8-10 hours of sleep. \n\n2. It feels like there are plenty of clubs, don\u2019t know anything about how it compares to other places. One thing is that if you\u2019re interested in a niche activity, you can just do it with your friends instead of making a club for it because the student body is so small, and as other people have mentioned there\u2019s not a lot of time for extracurriculars\n\n3. Other people have answered this pretty well. Strong math background, some math/physics background. \n\n4. My biggest reason for choosing Caltech was that I wanted a non-standard residential experience and I wanted to live in the houses. I don\u2019t regret this for a second, I love my house and I honestly don\u2019t know what I would do at a university without the social ties and upperclassmen resources (need a tutor or homework help? just walk into the lounge!) that come with having a house. I had other opportunities for places with strong academic programs (don\u2019t know exactly how quantitatively comparable, but I think I would have been academically happy there). I picked here. I don\u2019t know whether I would call this a reason to stay away or not but yes the academics are very rigorous and that causes me a lot of stress. I convinced myself that was what I wanted in a school and sometimes wonder if I was right. It\u2019s hard to maintain a desire to be challenged at this level, but I still think I will come out of it thinking it was worth it (but then I\u2019m just a freshman so maybe that\u2019s naive?)\n\n5. There are real hums. I know a history-mech E double major senior but as far as I can tell history is more of a priority for him. However there aren\u2019t a lot of varied options in the humanities (and if you want humanities that are just science lite, they exist). \n\n6. Don\u2019t know enough\n\n7. I would pick Caltech over MIT. Again, the house system was a big draw for me, and from what I understand the programs are similarly rigorous, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m either losing out academically or I would be any less stressed at MIT. Other people have said that Caltech\u2019s support programs aren\u2019t as good and while I don\u2019t know anything about MIT\u2019s support system, I\u2019m kinda confused by this because Caltech does have support systems which in my personal experience help when I actually use them (office hours, tutoring, peer advocates, counseling center, going to the deans for bigger things). I can\u2019t speak to others\u2019 experience though \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Also, when I went to an admissions talk for MIT, they pretty heavily pushed entrepreneurship and it felt somewhat individualistic to me, probably that doesn\u2019t reflect the student culture that much but I worried it would and it put me off (I want to go into academics, I don\u2019t want to go into industry and be pushed into that, I don\u2019t want to be an individual innovator I want to be a part of the scientific process). I would also pick Caltech over Stanford for more personal reasons, I visited Stanford and immediately just... didn\u2019t like the vibe there, I almost didn\u2019t apply. Didn\u2019t seem like a fit for me. \n\n8. Access to upperclassmen is pretty big for me. No frosh-only dorms. I have close friends in my house in every year. Also, Rotation and house stereotypes definitely have an effect on how it feels to be living in a house, it feels like you\u2019re among \u201cyour people\u201d in a way that I imagine but can\u2019t say for certain is stronger than when you pick a dorm to live in, because of the self-selection. (People do often have friends outside their houses though!)",

            "comment": "1. I generally try to shoot for 8 hours a night, and personally sleep 12-8 or 2-10.  Whether I can make this depends week to week and year to year, as a senior it's pretty easy, but for large portions of sophomore and junior years I was sleeping 4-6 hours a night.\n\n2. Clubs generally aren't that big on campus (people are mostly busy with other things), but for astronomy there's the Cahill Rooftop Observatory, with 8 and 14 inch telescopes available for students to use.  There's also a rocketry club on campus.\n\n3. If you haven't had AP Calculus BC or the equivalent, you're going to be in for a rough term or two in math an physics.  AP Chem is also helpful for chem classes but less important.\n\n4. I chose Caltech because I knew I wanted to do astronomy, and Caltech is hands down the best place in the world for observational astronomy.  The faculty and research opportunities here are incredible.  The biggest reason to stay away is the administration.  The current administrators seem, frankly, actively anti-intellectual, and really hate having to deal with students as adults and trained scientists.  Also their handling of title IX issues has been appallingly bad in several cases.\n\n5. The humanities are actually really good in my experience.  If you want to go science-lite that's definitely an option, but there are still a lot of English and history classes that are more traditional if that's what you're looking for.  In my experience (in French) our language instruction is also really good.\n\n6. Caltech will occasionally accept its own undergrads for graduate school, but because it's so small you're pretty heavily encouraged to go somewhere else.  Graduate schools in many fields will be familiar with Caltech students, and aware that Caltech is grade-deflated relative to other schools.\n\n7. I chose to come to Caltech over Stanford.  I didn't get in to MIT, so I didn't make that choice, but I think again I'd choose Caltech.  For astronomy, there isn't really anything comparable to the program here.\n\n8. I can't speak to other residential college systems, but I think one of the most important things about the house system is the size.  Each house is about 100 people, which creates a close sense of personal community within the house, in addition to the culture.",

            "comment": "1. Considering that it's currently 4am and I'm on reddit instead of doing my physics set, it depends pretty heavily on the night. A typical  bedtime for me is 2-5 am, but I've seen everywhere from midnight to 10 am. \n\n2. PARSEC, the rocketry club, is probably the most active aerospace club, I'm not sure how popular astronomy clubs are. You'll be pretty busy here with classes and such, which is why there seem to be fewer clubs and activities. Most colleges assume that you'll have several hours of extracurriculars in a given week (not including weekends), Caltech does not. \n\n3. Your experience in core will be pretty heavily dependent on your high school background. I personally had a pretty solid background in Math, Phys, and Chem which let me cruise through the first term core, but I did have to start working harder second term. It is very possible to do well with less high school experience, but it depends more on the amount of effort you're willing to put into your classes and how quickly you can grasp new concepts. \n\n4. I chose Caltech because I wanted to do more non-CS science in college and have time to explore the rest of STEM. My choice was basically between here and UIUC for free(ish), and when it came down to it, I chose the more interesting program where I could explore more of my passions (but the weather here is pretty excellent and also helped me decide). I personally think it's been worth it so far, but ask me again in a few years and we'll see. The reason (for me) to stay away from Caltech would have been having to do a lot of heavy work in different areas. If you're not a fan of being challenged in a lot of different areas, Caltech may not be the place for you. That being said, you're working alongside some of the smartest students in the world, so it's much more enjoyable than suffering alone. \n\n5. There are a good number of real humanities classes here, but you don't have to take them if you don't want to. There are many \"fake\" humanities courses as well, so you have a good amount of selection.\n\n6. Caltech is very well known to grad schools and there's a pretty good understanding that from junior year onwards, you're basically doing the work of grad students at most other universities. Caltech students are very well prepared for grad school, but there is some consideration of grade deflation. It's very hard to keep an impeccable GPA here (for like med school or law school), but for other grad school, you should be pretty much fine. I don't think there are a huge amount of students that do both undergrad and grad work here, mostly because you're usually more inclined to leave after being here for four years. Also, by the time you're ready for grad school, you probably have a pretty focused idea of what you want to do, and because Caltech is pretty small, you might not have a prof doing exactly what you're interested in. \n\n7. I never even applied to MIT and was rejected from Stanford, but I think I would choose Caltech in both cases. The smaller and more intimate community is pretty much perfect for me, and I don't think I would be enjoying myself as much at either institution. \n\n8. The houses seem to have the perfect combination of excellent students and personalities. A lot of the culture revolves around doing work, but since we all suffer together, we form a pretty tight culture. That's not to say that the houses don't have fun together, there's plenty of that too. However, I haven't experienced other residential colleges, so my opinion is probably a little biased. ",

IMO you have a lot of opportunities here to get research experience working with the leaders in your field, which is immensely important for grad schools (rec letters and research experience are incredibly valuable).  I didn't get into MIT so I can't make that comparison, but one of my favorite things about caltech is that the student body is so small that it's easy to know everyone in your year by sight.  It's a very tight-knit community and the students are very supportive of each other.  The houses help with that.  As mentioned above, my least favorite thing is the administration, which, in my opinion has made poor decisions recently.  But that's just my opinion and I'm graduating soon so oh well.

They gave very generous financial aid (like \\*everything\\* was covered, including living and dining) and it was the most prestigious school I got into. At the time I was also a huge physics nerd. Can't say if it was worth it or not. I've become miserable but I can't verify that I wouldn't have been miserable otherwise. Stay away from Caltech if you don't 100% know research is your passion. \n5. They're actually really good. The best teachers are the humanities ones in my opinion.\n6. Not sure tbh. Don't have much experience with grad school.\n7. MIT easily. They have a wider selection of things to do. Stanford SUPER easily since it has a much varied student body than either of these schools.

Turns out that it's really hard to do your \"duty\" if it ends up consuming your entire life and leaves little free time for what you really want to do.\n\nOn the other hand Caltech did turn me into a jock so you could argue that it's better to advance into an uncharted path rather than staying still in a safe place because then you might find something you didn't know you were looking for? :|",

The pranks took place in 2014, so I wonder if they are still in production and if they will return.\n\nI'm not a Caltech student(yet), so I cannot go to an on-campus store to get it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The mugs in question](https://preview.redd.it/cdbnvpoc8d8a1.jpg?width=1924&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bbbb303398137e053333d692196160383e7617b4)",

    "postText": "I didn't learn about the BS/MS program in Chemistry/Chemistry or Chemical Engineering/Chemistry until junior year. By then it was too late to reorganize my schedule to accommodate it.\n\nIf you are a younger student majoring in either Chemistry or Chemical Engineering and have good grades, PLEASE consider doing it. It can help you get into a better PhD program or grad school. Also, you can possibly shave a year or two off your PhD. Even if you can't shave off a year, it will definitely help you be a better chemist.\n\nI wish Caltech advertised this more. [Here's a link](http://www.cce.caltech.edu/content/bsms-joint-degree) to the program description, for reference.",

            "comment": "I wouldn't listen to this advice about graduate school. It's actually _harder_ to get into a competitive PhD program with a master's already, because a master's candidate is certainly expected to have more research output. I guess in Chemistry, it's possible to have several good results by the time you're out of undergrad, but you only mentioned \"having good grades\" which seems completely orthogonal to how your research output is.\n\nAside: this is why I chose to double major (do we even still call them options) EE/CS as opposed to doing the easier thing of getting a EE Master's with a CS bachelor's in the same amount of time.",

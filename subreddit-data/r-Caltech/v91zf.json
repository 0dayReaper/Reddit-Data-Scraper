Cordova Ave has been considered for a road diet for some time ( http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/Transportation/Road_Diet_FAQs/ ) and has had bike lanes installed on it east of Lake Ave. These have improved the safety of cyclists in that area. However, Cordova Ave west of Lake Ave is still intimidating to cyclists. Overall, Pasadena lacks good east-west routes for cyclists.\nWe petition the City of Pasadena to extend bike lanes on Cordova Ave west of Lake Ave, and to consider installing bike lanes on very wide one-way streets Green St and Union St. In addition, also consider placing bike sharrows on Del Mar Ave to improve the use of this route for cyclists. These improvements will create an east-west bike corridor for Pasadena and help make streets safer for everyone - cyclists, pedestrians, and cars alike.\n\nPlease help us by signing this petition! We aim to gather at least 1,000 signatures to present at the Pasadena General Plan Community Forum Meetings coming up on June 23 and 26.\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm thinking about doing a potsdoc at Caltech, but what I'm worried about is the availability of jobs for my girlfriend (she has a BSc / MSc in physics, namely biooptics). I think she'd have a lot more opportunities in LA than Pasadena as a research assistant, or something like that. Is it possible to live in between Pasadena so we could split the commute?\n\nThe other problem is we're both Canadian, do you know how hard it is to get a job with an MSc who will sponsor you?",

            "comment": "Depends on where her job is, but I know several couples who split jobs between Pasadena and the west side (about as far as you'll get away, commute-wise) and they're okay with it. She should, of course, apply for a job beforehand so that you know approximately where you should live.",

We would likely relocate as soon as we could once we found out where she worked. But thanks for the info, very helpful. ",

However the level of crumminess can vary a lot depending on individual circumstances, like how close her job is to the fwy offramp. There's plenty of people who do the worst commute (Pasadena to the WestSide/Santa Monica) and find it tolerable. (I personally found it soul-sucking.) That said, there's lots of opportunity in Pasadena itself in tech. If you could both live and work there, I'd be like \"totally go for it\" cuz Pasadena is the nicest city in Los Angeles.",

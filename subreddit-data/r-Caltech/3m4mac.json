I think this means that you can start a club with only three people, but that's not enough for a rugby team.\n\nThe problem with Caltech is that students tend to be apathetic and unwilling to commit to being club officers, although this may be improving in recent years. I graduated years ago, but I'm still around campus as a staff member and have been involved with clubs recently.\n",

    "postText": "This might be a shot in the dark, but has anyone extended the length of their MS? I understand the pure MS/no PhD is rare here, but I just committed to the MS in EE program. I could apply to the PhD in the Fall, but am not sure I want to commit to a PhD program, and would want to try research here before applying to PhD programs. It would also probably help my chances before applying.\n\nAnyone have any advice?",

Explain that you\u2019d be really interested in working with them provisionally for a year. Say, as a research assistant (not enrolled as a student, not taking classes, basically a \u201cpost bac\u201d instead of a \u201cpost doc\u201d). If you are a really good fit then they might be up for it. It would be cheaper than having you as a student anyway.",

Folks in my MS group who wanted to continue through the PhD program did, though they just had to work a little harder to find space in a lab come spring quarter.",

FYI the MS is just the first year of the PhD program for those departments that even have an MS program.",

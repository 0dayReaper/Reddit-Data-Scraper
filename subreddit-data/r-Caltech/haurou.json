This would probably be a bit of a red flag, but otherwise, it shouldn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t include them because you didn\u2019t take them.",

These kids often stand out (by placing out of core, scoring HM+ on putnam, etc), but they really are the exception, not the rule at Caltech. (MIT is a different story...) \n\nFor the record, I was not one of them (my AIME scores were too low to write on my application, let alone qualify for USAMO), but I still got in, had a great time at tech, and went on to do a math PhD.",

I took the AHSME multiple times, qualified for AIME once, and did not qualify for the next level. I did well at the county level in the first round of the Chemistry Olympiad qualifications, but I think I did very poorly at the next level because I had no clue how to investigate things in the lab.",

    "postText": "I feel like core is more rigorous than GE requirements at other schools, especially because you can't bypass core like you can bypass many GE courses with AP and IB credits.\n\nBased on Caltech's website, it seems pretty hardcore, but also very tedious:\n\n\"You'll build the base for your academic career with three terms of\u00a0math, three terms of\u00a0physics, two terms of\u00a0chemistry, one term of\u00a0biology, two\u00a0lab\u00a0courses, 12 terms of\u00a0humanities and social sciences\u00a0classes, one term of\u00a0scientific communication, three terms of\u00a0physical education, and one\u00a0freshman \"menu\" course\u00a0(choose between courses like astrophysics, environmental sciences and engineering, energy and society, or information and logic).\"\n\nI want to hear from Caltech/ex Caltech students; do you think core was worthwhile? How much did you take away from it? Did you feel like you were held back from pursuing courses related to your major earlier? Was it a blessing or an obstacle?\n",

I\u2019m not great at math, and got virtually nothing out of math core (if anything, I ended up worse at calculus and multivar than when I started). On the other hand, I got a ton out of physics core, including some of the stuff I should have learned in math.\n\nBut, some people I know would say the opposite, that they got a lot out of math but not a lot out of physics. It\u2019s really just a person-by-person thing.\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag.",

The large majority of the material will completely useless to me throughout life (quantum mechanics+premed=yay). The content is difficult and the profs have no interest in teaching coherently and would rather go off on abstract tangents on the blackboard than give concrete examples that help us digest the material. I love Caltech and the people here, but core and the teaching of core needs a lot of work.",

            "comment": "In principle, having a broad interdisciplinary education is not a bad thing, but I found the core math and physics classes very hard. I didn't retain much. Caltech doesn't accept AP credit because there is a gap between the level required to do well on AP calculus and physics and the level of Caltech core. As someone who aced AP calculus and AP physics but didn't do any study more advanced than the exams, I wasn't prepared for Caltech. If I had done any more advanced study, I might have figured that I wasn't cut out for Caltech and not bothered to come. That would have been a reasonable decision. My school basically taught what was on the exams, if that. My AP Physics C teacher didn't really teach anything relevant the whole year, so I self-studied and got help from my physics PhD dad to prepare for the exam. ",

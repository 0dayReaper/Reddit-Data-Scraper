I just have a few questions for you guys, thank you so much for helping me with them.\n1: What do you wish you had known before you started to attend?\n2: I'm from Ohio, any extra info an out of state guy should know?\n3: My main focus is (hopefully) going to be astrophysics. If anyone involved in that program [or just plain old physics, I'm not picky :)] can give advice, warn me off, or give some helpful hints, I'd really appreciate it.\n4: What is your favorite thing about the college, and the thing you really dislike?\n\nThank you all so much, I really do appreciate it.",

            "comment": "**1. What do I wish I had known?**\n\nYou have to work really hard.  And so does everyone else.  I mean, I guess I knew this before I went, but it's really a different kind of hard work than most people are used to in high school.  In high school, the limit was physical fatigue in that the limit of your achievements is your ability to stay awake and work hard.  At tech, it's mental fatigue in that the limit of your achievements is the ability to keep working even though sometimes it seems like you're not making progress.    \n\n**2. Out-of-State**\n\nCaltech is in Southern California, but you really need a car to do other stuff in Southern California.  Or you could make friends with someone who has a car.  On the other hand, there wasn't always a lot of time to do other stuff.  \n\n**3. Astrophysics**\n\nI graduated in 2008 in Applied Physics.  I had a couple of friends who were in Astrophysics and what I remember is that both Astrophysics and Applied Physics had a lot of overlap in courses with the physics major outside of core (the ones that everyone takes), with the overlap being primarily physics based.  I'm not sure how it is at other universities, but I would assume at other schools you would probably get physics for astro majors rather than physics for physics majors.  \n\n**4. Likes, Dislikes**\nThe people.  I continue to be close to the core group of friends I made at Tech.  They understand your nerdy jokes and the difficulty and benefits of working hard.  I'm sure that this is probably true for most people who go to college, but you'll probably find that Techers are more like-minded than the friends you would make at other universities.  \n\nI also like that the athletic department understands that Techers are students first.  \n\nI dislike how burned out I was after graduating.  I'm doing quite well now, but I think that a lot of students go through a phase during junior and senior year where we get mentally fatigued from the hard work.  I think that's part of the collateral damage of going to a school like Tech.  \n",

            "comment": "1. I wish I'd known more about the dining options (or lack thereof). There are three places you can eat lunch during the week, which are all actually pretty good, but after a few years of eating them I'd really like some more variety. House dinners are buffet-style where the menu items change daily, but you really don't have many choices, so if you don't like what you see on a given day, you're pretty outta luck.\n\n2. There isn't too much to say about coming from out of state...LA is big and sprawl-y and has a lot of really cool places to explore. It never really gets below ~60 F during the day and ~40 during the night, so leave your winter clothing at home (unless you want to go on a ski trip in the nearby mountains or something).\n\n3. I'm Math/CS, so this is a bit out of my league. I can say that if you major in astrophysics and don't like the astro part, then you can easily switch to physics, and if you don't like the physics part, then you can easily switch to planetary science (one of my friends did this and he's a lot happier now). The astrophysics majors I know are generally pretty happy.\n\n4. My favorite thing about Caltech is the house system, which gives me a really close-knit group of people that I fool around with and get along with really well. All of the eight houses have their own personalities and quirky traditions. However, some aspects of the system have recently been in jeopardy due to my least favorite thing about Caltech, which is the administration. They've never had a good relationship with the undergrads, and lately, they've really been interfering with a lot of our traditions, even disbanding one of the houses this past year (although it's been restored by now).\n\nLet me know if elaboration on anything!",

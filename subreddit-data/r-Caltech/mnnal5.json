    "postText": "Hello!  \n\n\nI am a current high school senior. Caltech was my dream school, but I was sadly rejected. I am going to go to UT Austin and major in physics. I am interested in quantum information and condensed matter physics, and I am very interested in the works of Alexei Kitaev and John Preskill and I want to join one of their groups for my PhD. IQIM is the greatest institute in the world for the type of physics I am interested in, and I would love to receive an education there. I am planning on getting a double major in both physics and math, and I planned out all my classes for undergrad. I should be taking all grad classes by 2nd semester of sophomore year. I also plan on doing research as much as I possibly can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there any advice you have on what I should do during undergrad in order to get accepted to the Kitaev or Preskill group?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your time!",

            "comment": "That's fantastic that you have a clear goal in mind of what you want to study! And congrats on UT Austin, it's also a great school for quantum information.\n\nThat said, don't get your heart dead-set on one particular branch of physics early on. It's very common -- the norm, even -- to have your taste change substantially during undergrad. After all, that's what undergrad is about: building some breadth within your major so that you can decide what to focus on. Don't overcommit!\n\nBut, in the mean time, what do you do? Take whatever classes your school offers on quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics (possibly some CS class on information theory), and if you can, some GR. (Black holes are a big thing to talk about in quantum information). If you're interested in the algorithmic side of things, understanding tensor networks and MPS could be valuable as well.\n\nThen, by the end of your sophomore year, try to find a group to do research with. Ideally you could do research with them the summer after your sophomore year, then continue that the summer after your junior year, and maybe a senior thesis, or a paper with them. You'll have built a strong relationship with a professor that can write you a good recommendation letter.",

                    "comment": "The only thing I can add on to this is try your best to do a SURF/MURF at Caltech over a summer. It's a lot easier to get into a group if a faculty member already knows you and might be willing to put a word in. Also, take a look at what other faculty they publish paper with and look at applying to summer programs at those schools.\n\nI didn't get in to Caltech for undergrad, even though it was my dream school. It was, honestly, for the best since Caltech didn't offer the major I decided on as an undergrad degree, and I would have been really unhappy with the closest one they did have. I wound up going there for my PhD (even though I didn't get a summer internship there at any point).",

            "comment": "First off, congrats on going to UT Austin! That is a very good school, with a strong physics program! (IMO, public schools are *wildly* underrated, but I digress...)\n\nI agree with everything the other poster said - and I\u2019ll put an even bigger emphasis on research. Research is *by far* the most important aspect of your applications (You should keep your grades up as well, of course, but research is what you\u2019ll be doing most of your time during a PhD) - get involved early and often. Try to do summer programs as well, whether it be an NSF REU, internships are a research institute/national lab, or even a SURF (say, here at Caltech).\n\nAs for the specific groups you mentioned here: Preskill\u2019s group is quite big and decentralized, so if you get admitted to Caltech you can probably get in there. Kitaev doesn\u2019t really take students, and if he did would probably take a math student anyway - so tbh I would not bother with him at all.\n\nDon\u2019t get too caught up in the big names here, either; we have plenty of other great QI faculty here. Fernando Brandao and Manuel Endres come to mind, along with a host of others.\n\nHope that helps!",

                    "comment": "Oh, yes, looking at my comment now I realize that I made research sound secondary. Research is absolutely several times (5x?) more important than grades in your classes. I mentioned the grades/classes thing first because, as a freshman+sophomore, taking classes that get you up to speed on the things you need will be the main thing you can do. In my experience (personally and those around me), the \"good\" research -- the research you show off to grad schools -- pretty much never starts until the summer after sophomore year.\n\nAnd ditto not prioritizing big names. After my freshman year, I had a summer with IQIM, where I was *technically* working with Kitaev and Preskill. In reality, I think I spoke with Kitaev all of once at the summer, and he didn't really know what I was working on. That's not anything against him, he's a great guy, just does not get involved in mentoring students very much. Preskill on the other hand was much more involved.",

            "comment": "UT Austin is a very good school for quantum information, so congratulations -- you're already at a very strong starting point.\n\nThat being said -- I wouldn't advise you to structure your undergraduate years around the goal of being accepted to Kitaev or Preskill's group. I wouldn't even advise you to do that around the goal of being accepted into IQIM. You'll change over the next four years, if not after -- I'm speaking from experience. I spent two summers in IQIM, and three academic years doing related research. Now I'm doing high energy theory in grad school -- not entirely unrelated, but it's very different from the kind of work I did back in college. Case in point: people change. \n\nNow, I know you won't listen to me because *I* wouldn't have listened to me when I was eighteen, so if you have your heart set on joining IQIM and you're absolutely certain your goal will never change -- I suggest you be open to working with other professors in the institute. I think Kitaev and Preskill prefer to mentor postdocs. Xie Chen, Fernando Brandao, and Thomas Vidick (he's in CS, but does quantum computing) all come to mind as very good options. You should try applying to Caltech for a SURF and see if one of those professors is willing to take you on as an undergraduate for a summer.",

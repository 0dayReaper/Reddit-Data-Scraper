    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI'll be starting my PhD at Caltech in the fall and I'm just wondering what the social atmosphere is like. I know, I know, no time for friends, blah blah, etc. But seriously, the impression I get thus far from students in my department us that there are a lot of pretty laid back but the undergrad population is a little... uptight.\n\nAnywho, I'm asking because I probably operate on a little bit if a different social schedule than the typical grad student. Or maybe I don't, and you can assuage my fears that I won't find anyone with whom to make stupid decisions after a long week of making good ones. Any current grad students want to chime in? Prospective students? Any undergrads want to defend your honor?",

I think it really depends on your department (I'm in the biggest graduate department on campus, so there is wide range of people I encounter everyday) and your lab group. My group is incredibly social. My friends in other lab groups are incredibly social. We make lots of what you might call stupid (but I call fun) decisions. We go on group trips together, too; we've been camping, to Vegas, rented a beach house, headed into LA to go dancing...on and on. We go on bar crawls and to trivia and Rath al Fresco fairly often, too. \n\nI think you just need to make an effort to find the right people when you get here--they are here, I promise. Make sure you choose your lab group wisely. Don't underestimate the impact a social group can have on your life/general mental well-being. I don't think I could get through this program if it weren't for my friends and labmates. You might have to seek out people in other departments and in other years, too. It might take a bit of work, but the social life you're talking about definitely exists here. If you have any other questions, let me know!",

It is a great place for graduate school, small enough to be intimate (the registrar will know your name by the time you're done), but large enough to afford a variety of experiences. \n\nI agree with the other students in your department, but what do you mean about a different social schedule? I am sure that you'll find plenty of people to hang with, and make stupid decisions with. \n\nHere is the [official](http://today.caltech.edu/calendar/index.tcl?type=social) social calendar so you can see what's going on lately.\n\nOther things to do are to join the Athenaeum (discounted rates for grad students) and head down to the Rathskeller for happy hours, and the outdoor Rath al Fresco in the summer. Entire labs/departments will head over.\n\nFinally, USC is just a few miles away and I knew a couple people who would regularly head over for social events.\n",

PM me when you get here and we'll talk about what you might be looking for.\n\nOk, I thought about this, and I guess there is one exception - even among the relaxed undergrads, the tiny school population makes everything a bit less of a free environment because everyone knows everyone. But considering that, it's one of the most relaxed places I know at times.",

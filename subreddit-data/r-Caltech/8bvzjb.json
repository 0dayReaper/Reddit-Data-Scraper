    "postText": "I've been accepted into both Cal Poly SLO and CalTech for computer science. Right now though I'm seriously torn between which one to attend.\n\n\nOn the one hand, SLO's Learn by Doing methodology and close industry connections will seriously up my odds of finding work right out of college. However, CalTech bears some serious reputation in the STEM world and attending would then make it significantly easier to get into grad school what with research opportunities and all. Both have small class sizes and close faculty-student relationships, though CalTech obviously wins in that regard. CalTech also doesn't accept any AP credit whereas given my current situation I could be entering SLO with sophomore standing.\n\nAny current students at CalTech, I'd seriously appreciate any feedback about why I should choose CalTech, because this is one of the most important decisions of my life up to this point.\n\nEdit: I just want to add that CalTech is 12k more expensive than SLO and cost is one of my primary concerns in regards to college. I'll be visiting during PreFrosh to see for myself whether or not I feel like I fit here because as great as a CalTech degree is I don't want my college experience to be completely miserable.",

            "comment": "The one year advantage is a drop in the bucket.\n\nIf you're concerned about finding work- Caltech's name will carry you far.\n\nThe issue is actually the education. Caltech will beat the shit out of you and challenge you like never before (I mean that in a good way), but it's easy to miss pretty fundamental skills at a school this small. If you want to be an exceptional software engineer, I suspect you'll learn how to do that at SLO. If you want to be thrown into the deep end and take charge of learning the practical stuff along the way, then  there's likely no better place than Caltech.\n\nEdit: DAYUM. The advisory board for SLO's CS department has every company worth working for. (Link: https://csc.calpoly.edu/iab/)\n\nEdit 2: SLO's four year plan for a CS major is here: http://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/downloads/mymap/17-19.52CSCBSU.pdf. It looks really, really solid. Caltech's CS major plan is here: http://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/ugrad_cs. You will notice there's *way* more freedom. That can be a good thing! It can also cause you to be blind to aspects of computer science that are important for long-term success.",

All I know is that I like programming, I just don't know what specifically I want to focus on (or research) in the future. Grad school was also never really a big priority for me. ",

I haven't even taken BC, proof-based math or any physics, my scores were ok at best and I've never conducted research, so I feel like I'm gonna be lagging from the start. Combined with 60+ workweeks it's going to be very rough.",

The culture almost immediately clicked with me and the opportunities the school offered absolutely blew away anything the other colleges I got accepted into had to offer \\(including Cal Poly\\). The internships will provide me the practical experience for CS to balance out the heavy theory and things like SURF will let me explore my interests in chemistry.\n\nI now plan on committing to Caltech. It will be hard and beat me into proper time management, but I believe that this will be an experience well worth it.",

Same is true of the other frosh classes.\n\nAnd people do graduate in three years, if you pick your classes well it seems pretty doable for CS, I was only really missing random core/PE requirements as a senior. Iirc you are forced to pay four years of tuition though.\n\nPersonally I would be very surprised if any alums feel that they would trade the Caltech \"experience\" (and reputation of course) for a one-year advantage over their peers after undergrad. And generally I think we do pretty well in finding work after college, you will likely end up knowing many people who can put in a recommendation and our career fair is very well attended by top-tier companies.",

            "comment": "Caltech is ideal for students are passionate and excited to be learning all kinds of science. E.g. while I was a math major, I ended up taking about 10 chemistry classes. The graduation requirements will force you to take a variety of math and science classes regardless of your major, so if this is bothersome you would not enjoy your first year at Caltech. (Those classes are harder than any AP exams, so AP credit is not accepted.)\n\nCaltech is not a vocational school; only taking CS classes at Caltech will not set you up to be a successful programmer, as I believe the curriculum focuses more on theoretical aspects of computer science (e.g. complexity theory, information theory) compared to practical aspects of programming (e.g. program architecture).\n\nCaltech's reputation is unbeatable, but if you know that you want to pursue a career in programming instead of going to graduate school, a smart recruiter will be more interested in your work experience than undergraduate school.",

But if you want the chance to push some boundaries, Tech is probably a better option.  If you want to pursue research, your path is probably better through Caltech.  \n\nDo a search of where Caltech alums wind up and where SLO alums wind up. \n\nTech is soul-crushingly difficult.  Whether or not the financial cost and experience are worth it to you depends on what you want to get out of it.\n\nWherever you go - try to crush it and make the most of the opportunity.  If you spend the next 3-4 years goofing off and wasting it, that's going to cost you more than selecting the \"wrong\" college.",

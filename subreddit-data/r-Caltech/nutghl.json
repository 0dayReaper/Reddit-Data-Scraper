I live on the east coast and have never crossed the Mississippi River, so it'll be a very new experience for me!\n\nThanks!",

I could probably keep going with more suggestions if you have particular activities or types of food you're looking for--these are just the first that came to mind.\n\nFor example, even if you don't have a car, if you can get yourself to a Metro station (e.g., by bike), you can ride the Metro to some interesting things near Downtown LA, like Chinatown (which has become a bit of an artist/hipster area) and Little Tokyo (the Japanese American National Museum is great and there's lots of good food in that area).",

The three restaurants I truly miss are Casa Bianca pizza in Eagle Rock, Saladang Thai, and Zankou Chicken. And if you're into it, Soot Bull Jeep in Koreatown.\n\nedit: maybe Lucky Boy's or Tommy's if it's midnight and I'm drunk.",

I\u2019ve really enjoyed exploring the hikes in the San Gabriel mountains up north, the trails by Santa Monica, and Joshua Tree. There are a few group chats for people that enjoy hiking at Caltech that go on random trips that you might try out as well. Huntington Gardens is also amazing and is within walking distance of Caltech. I\u2019m still learning the restaurants in Pasadena, but there are a lot of options.",

    "postText": "Be brutally honest \n\nHey, I am a student at UCI and am majoring in computer engineering. I would love to get into caltech\u2019s graduate school program for physics and I have some questions about admissions. I transferred in from a community college and I didn\u2019t do many activities in CC. But at UCI I plan on doing undergrad research, making good connections with my professors and other people in the physics/engineering department, some internships, and keeping my gpa in the 3.8-3.85 range (that is magna cum lade at UCI I\u2019m pretty sure) With all these factors do I have a realistic shot at getting into Caltech\u2019s grad program for physics? I have such a passion for physics and education in general but I realized my love for it a bit late in community college; this is why my gpa and other extra curricular activities aren\u2019t as strong as I want them to be, especially for the standard at Caltech. But I just want to know my chances, what are other things I can do to boost my resume? (Maybe some Caltech specific things)",

I got in to Caltech for physics grad school with a lower GPA.\n\nI disagree with the other commenter about needing to have a specific research project in mind when you applied. I didn\u2019t.\n\nHow many physics courses have you taken / will you take in undergrad? If you aren\u2019t majoring in physics (or something very similar) then that will look bad on your application. You\u2019ll be expected to arrive with a working knowledge of most physics topics.\n\nYou need to do some physics research as an undergrad to have any shot at getting in.",

As others said, you want to be very specific about why Caltech and what research here is particularly interesting to you in your application.\n\nIn terms of your undergrad background, I personally would recommend doubling in physics if it is possible. At least my perception as an engineer is that the engineering programs here welcome physicists, but it is much harder to come as a physics graduate student if you have an engineering background. The exception perhaps is applied physics which has a mix of people from both. But the language of physics and content of a physics degree is very different from that of engineering, so I think completing the full physics curriculum will help to better prepare you (and make some of the involved exams from the physics GRE to the qualifying exam much easier to study for)!",

I get that changing is going to be a PITA, but it's one of those things of seeing how you do in core physics courses in undergrad.\n\nOne of my advisors rattled off a pretty good laundry list of what a physics graduate student is expected to have at their fingertips. Now, I can't remember that list, because I certainly didn't have that then, so I don't have it now. But it's the core working knowledge of physics that you should have upon graduating with a bachelors or by the end of your first year in graduate school.\n\nHave you considered applied physics? https://www.aph.caltech.edu/academics/grad",

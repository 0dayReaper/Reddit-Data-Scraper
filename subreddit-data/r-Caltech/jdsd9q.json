    "postText": "On average, **more than 98% of graduate students** offered admission at Caltech are offered a package of merit-based financial support that pays all tuition charges and provides them with a stipend. The only major exception is the case of students in terminal master's programs, who in many cases are self-supported or who have a financial sponsor. These students should refer to the information on financing a graduate education.\n\nI found the above text from **University website.**\n\nI'm planning for my masters in aerospace engineering. Do most of the students get funded for their master degree or it is only valid for PhDs",

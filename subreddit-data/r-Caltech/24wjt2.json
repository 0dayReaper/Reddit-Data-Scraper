I have no intention of majoring in English (or any humanities field for that matter), but I do appreciate reading and studying good books every once in a while, and would like to know whether any of the literature courses (there don't seem to be many) are worth taking sometime in the next four years.",

I think types of classes offered change frequently but just show up to a bunch and see which one seems interesting.  Russian literature in translation was hugely popular when I was there because the prof was really cool and it was at night (as opposed to morning).  I also took a british sci-fi class (frankenstein, etc) that was ok.  I think the main thing is whether the prof makes it interesting or not.\n\nhope that helps",

I enjoyed the courses and seriously considered a double major/minor in English.\n\nIf you already read a lot, you might be able to choose courses where you have already read some of the books. It helps the classes be less burdensome and more fun.",

A fair amount of reading (a novel per week) and a bunch of essays, but interesting lectures and analysis.\nThere isn't much choice in terms of classes, so if you only like some super specific type of literature, it might be hard to find what you want, but overall there are a few good options.\nAlso, specifically for sci-fi, there are student groups (SPECTRE) that run a library and would be happy to talk about books with you.",

            "comment": "Graduated with an English major in 2013. While limited in number, the English courses at Caltech are indeed worth taking if you enjoy reading and analyzing literature. Each professor focuses on different topics and has a different style of teaching/workloads, but we do have a large enough English/Humanities department that you should be able to find something (or many things!) to your tastes. If not, there's En98, a self-directed English course in which you can design your own syllabus with a professor of your choosing. \n\nUnfortunately, most courses are offered during only one quarter ever other year, so scheduling can be a pain depending on your major/other classes (but this is another instance in which En98 can be helpful!). Honestly, I've found each of my classes at minimum enjoyable, even if I didn't necessarily like every novel/poem/etc that we had to read. ",

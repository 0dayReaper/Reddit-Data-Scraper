I want to get a bunch of prerequisites out of the way so I can take some cool advanced classes senior year, but to avoid overloading I have to skip hums...Anyone having the same problem as me?",

They were different enough that it wasn't overwhelming.\n\nOoh, just looked up what I actually took that term, turns out I sent a gmail about it:\n\n* BEM 106\n* Ch 003A\n* E 10\n* Ec 11\n* Law 134\n* SS/Psy/Bi/CNS 140\n\nThat CNS 140 course was much closer to biology than psychology (I was a CS major).",

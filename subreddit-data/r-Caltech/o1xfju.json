A couple of years ago, I think the table tennis classes were canceled, but when they brought back the classes. I have no idea if they brought her back. She runs a couple of table tennis clubs in the LA area.\n\nSource: I work at Caltech. I visited the Pasadena Table Tennis Club several years ago but haven't played much since then. I would also practice with the Caltech Table Tennis Club, which I'm not sure exists anymore as a formal club.",

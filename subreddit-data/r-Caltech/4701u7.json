    "postText": "Hi all! I'm a current sophomore.\n\nAlthough I'm already two years in, I am still grappling with understanding why humanities classes are required at Caltech. About every couple of weeks I tend to oscillate between an edgy teenage voice in my head saying \"the humanities are worthless!\" and a more calming voice of reason saying \"humanities classes help you think critically and process information.\" However no matter what I just can't suppress that voice in the back of my mind questioning the usefulness of the humanities courses.\n\nI can see humanities classes being useful if done in a sincere way, but from my experience most humanities courses are not done as sincerely as faculty might hope. For example, just a few minutes ago I heard someone in my hallway exclaiming, \"I have an essay and two problem sets due tomorrow! I'm just going to BS something for the essay and hope I get an A!\" I am occasionally drawn to this type of thinking as well, even if I know how insincere it is.\n\nAll this makes me question how useful of an exercise it is to require undergraduates to take 12 humanities courses over 4 years. One response may be that humanities classes help with writing, and eventually yield dividends when it comes to scientific writing. But in that case, why doesn't Caltech have students primarily take scientific writing courses instead, or require an undergraduate research thesis? Why does writing education have to be delivered through a broad range of topics ranging from social sciences to philosophy? Another response may be that humanities classes provide a break from the sciences, but to me it seems like having no humanities requirement would be reduce stress by providing more free time to students.\n\nWhatever Caltech's end goal for us is, why does it have to be executed through 12 humanities courses, four of which are humanities, four of which are social sciences, and four of which are wildcard courses? It seems somewhat arbitrary, and I have trouble seeing if there would be an effective difference in our educational outcomes if no humanities courses were required at all. ",

    "postText": "The document talking about the Chemistry Advanced Placement Exam states:\n\n&gt;Incoming freshmen and transfer students seeking credit for Ch1ab must return the exam before Monday, July 27, 2020. We especially encourage students interested in Chemistry or Chemical Engineering to return a completed exam. If you do not return the Exam during this test period, you will not get another opportunity.\n\nDo most Chemistry and ChemE majors place out of Ch1ab? I had always heard that placing out of classes at Caltech was extremely rare. I read the syllabus and think I know all the material of Ch1ab from taking AP Chem, but I never planned on placing out of any intro classes (assuming I could pass the placement exams) at Caltech because I figured I\u2019d want to get properly adjusted to the rigor of Caltech through these intro classes. However, after reading that it\u2019s \u201cespecially encouraged\u201d to take the placement exam and reading the syllabus of Ch1ab (which seems to align almost perfectly with AP Chem), I\u2019m having second thoughts on if that\u2019s a good idea.\n\nIs anyone able to weigh in? Thanks.",

If you've already learned the topics before, you'll end up relearning/doing everything and it's a waste a time. Take the opportunity to do another class/req instead, since with pass-fail it'll still ease you into the workload",

I also took AP chem in high school and found the material in Ch1ab to be sufficiently different to be interesting.  The intro courses are a great way to bond with other members of your frosh class, but getting them out of the way can open up your schedule for more interesting classes down the line or more time to do research.",

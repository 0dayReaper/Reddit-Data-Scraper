    "postText": "Hi All, We are a group of high school students, going through a entrepreneurship incubator and are working on developing a project which aims to connect college students to high school students to have a true personal experience (we have over 70 mentors from MIT, Princeton, UPenn etc as of now, and have several people ready to go on such tours). We were wondering whether any of you would be willing to allow a high school student to shadow you for any portion of the day, for example sitting in your classes, experiencing cafeteria food (high schoolers pay), or taking part in your extracurriculars. This is just the jist of it. If you would be willing to, we will get in touch with you and a potential compensation method for you ASAP through this: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevSmq19AjZzqBsD8kVyxk5DT\\_JCxtbYjArVa2R8b5Stz1ysg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevSmq19AjZzqBsD8kVyxk5DT_JCxtbYjArVa2R8b5Stz1ysg/viewform)",

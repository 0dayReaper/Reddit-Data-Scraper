    "postText": "Hey :)\n\nI'm a ugrad student from the UK who's looking for something to do after my degree. I'm super interested in the HSS PhD program at Caltech but I really don't know too much about it, at least nothing too specific (probably due to how varied the program is). Is there anyone here who's currently on the program or who did it in the past?\n\nAs far as my background, if you're interested, I study MORSE at Warwick. It's basically a mix of math, statistics, and economics. I'm more focused on the economics part, I love microeconomic theory and I'm doing some political science modules as well.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice/help",

From my interactions with them both socially and academically, I'd say they are doing some highly theoretical microeconomics and all are math whizzes. If you are interested in macroeconomics, this is not the place for you. Otherwise, this is the best place!",

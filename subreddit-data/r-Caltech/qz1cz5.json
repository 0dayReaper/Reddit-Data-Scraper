    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI am a current first-year student at UCSD, studying EE, and I want to participate in some programs over the summer at Caltech. \n\nThe problem is, I do not know what exactly to look for. \n\nI am interested in robotics, and engineering in general, and would love to work on research/work in a club/participate in a program but I did not find anything. \n\nCould you please give me some advice on what to look into, and who should I contact. \n\nThank you in advance. \n\nPS. I should mention that I am on an F-1 visa",

I already look over surf, but most of the physics related programs are Caltech Students Only, I\u2019d like to know is there any available program for me? PS: I\u2019m international students, so the JPL is not eligible for me.",

            "comment": "I'm a freshman at Caltech. I still haven't experienced THAT much about it, but I'll share what I've learned in my first term\n\nWe don't actually have an Aerospace major, although I believe you can minor in Aerospace. The best thing about Aerospace is that JPL is just nearby and you're likely to get internships there.\n\nFirst thing I'd like to warn you about Caltech is that it is hard. Don't expect to come here and blaze through all the course material and exit with 2 majors and a business minor. A couple of good things result from the difficulty. Caltech students are overall not competitive with each other in terms of grades. I've spent a lot of time helping friends with sets and getting help. Expect a lot of collaboration. I really enjoy this as homework time usually means bonding time as we suffer together :D\n\nI really love the house system at Caltech. Because of rotation rules, I cannot tell you that many details of specific houses. I can tell you that each house has its own unique nature and personality. A house is kinda of like both a faternity and a dorm that is \"owned\" by the school but moderated by the students. As a frosh, you get sorted into the houses kinda very much like in harry potter. You live in that house frosh year, and may continue living there if the house has space. Even if you don't start out as being like the house, its quite likely that you assimilate into the house culture. Every house eats together (except for Avery which has open meals) for dinner. You can join other houses if you wish to take part in their activities. \n\nAs to applying, the best way to get into Caltech is having straight As in all honors classes, perfect SAT/ACT scores, and droves of extra curriculars. Obvious right? If you have that, how do you improve your chances? What you want to do in your Caltech application is show your interest and dedication in science. Take more science courses, and do things like math competitions and science fairs. You also want to show that you have something unique about yourself, something interesting that not many people have.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know",

Caltech looks for a variety of things, and the student body here is so varied that no one thing will get you in. I know people who got 3.5s and did fairly poorly on the SATs (500-600 range) and still got into Caltech because they demonstrated a passion for science and a sense of leadership and responsibility, among other things. \n\nSo the best advice anybody can really give you is be honest in your essays. Tell them about what makes you tick. Why do you want to attend a school that you know full well will kick your ass? (We'll be completely honest: this school chews you up and spits you back out and repeats this until you either fail or have a degree.) Do you relish the challenge, the opportunities here? Is there some extra thing you do outside of school that few other people do?\n\nNo one thing is a guarantee into the school. The obvious things like test scores and extra curriculars help, but even if you're the best scholar the world has ever seen and are president of every club on campus and captain of the soccer team, it doesn't guarantee you in. Find a passion, and show us through that passion that you belong here.",

I sincerely believe that what got me into Caltech was my essay on something that had changed or shaped me. I wrote about my passion for improv and my transformation from a pupil to a leader and teacher in our troupe. Improv was my \"some extra thing\" on top of my love for math and science.I had passion for both, and I showed them how I had harnessed that energy in that essay. \n\nGood luck OP",

            "comment": "You're probably going to ask this question anyway later - but here's the analogy you want:\n\n&gt;MIT teaches you how to be a chef and how to be a knife - and it does these both pretty well. Caltech teaches you to be the sharpest knife, period. Restaurants with Chefs want Caltech grads because sharp knifes are amazing tools. Restaurants want Chefs and their Knives. People want Caltech grads if they need the absolute best and know what to do with them. People want MIT grads if they need someone to show them the way and then do it.\n\nMIT probably excels in specific areas due to its location, such as biology (genetics research all over the place maaaan) and engineering. It tends to fare better in teaching practical applications and mixing it with a little bit of theory -- you tend to have strong knowledge in your major without a huge broadening, and if you want this, you need to be extra passionate. Caltech will throw every book it can at you in pretty much every field (Math, Physics, Philosophy, Chemistry, etc...) and you have to be good at quite a lot of things. You may not get the focus in your field as you would at other schools, but you will have a lot of learned concepts that might just help you from time to time.\n\nSocially - MIT will win if you care more about being an extrovert. There's a ton to do in the area that is perfect for those from 18-22... and once you mature quite a bit, it becomes rather annoying and immature. You might find it hard to grow up at MIT, but you will find it hard to be bored there. Caltech will win if you care more about being an introvert. There's not as much to do in the area, but the food is ridiculously excellent, as well as the weather. The area is very mature, and forces you to grow up a bit more than you might like - but it gives you a more realistic impression of the world, while being in the Caltech bubble.\n\nAt the same time, having had friends at both MIT and Caltech... I would choose my friends at Caltech any day. At MIT - there certainly are fantastic people to know that would fit you perfectly... but they are few and far between because there's a lot of assholes. I've had to cut quite a few ties in my time simply because I could not respect some of my friends there anymore. At Caltech, because of the \"lack\" of a social hub right outside of the school - you bond a lot better with your peers and many of these relationships are the strongest you'll find; with roommates, gf/bf, friendships, etc... At MIT, this is not so. I find this to be a really unattractive feature of a college. On top of this, Caltech does not have a Greek culture, but MIT does (and reputedly one of the best in the country?). MIT 'houses' such as Baker or Next or East Campus or Senior House are significantly in worse condition than Caltech housing (cleanliness, respectfulness of property, prices, size, bathrooms, and so on) and do not have very strong cultures overall (you tend to find stronger cultures within the FLOOR of a house). Caltech houses/hovses and Avery [haha! see what I did there?] have very strong overall cultures and most (not everyone) are satisfied with results of Rotation and feel very strongly for their house/hovse. On top of it all, I find Caltech housing to be one of the most nicest places to live, ever, as someone who is not Bill Gates/Warren Buffet.\n\nFinally, as far as application goes - keep the following things in mind:\n\n * SAT/ACT scores are used particularly as a threshold cut-off. Be the top x% of applicants and you're through the initial round.\n * Be unique, yourself, and honest on the applications. Caltech's questions are not meant to throw you off, but try to get you to actually open up. We care A LOT about who you are, not just what you've done.\n * Balance academics and extracurricular activities (such as music or volunteerism) is a must-have on your application. This shows time management skills and that you _work hard and play hard_.\n * Turn everything in before the deadline. You don't want to panic when the website goes down and you can't submit things because everyone is doing it. Also call Caltech Admissions from time to time to check on physical materials you needed to send (if any) and any questions you might have. Make sure they know who you are ;)\n\nGood Luck - you'll need it. I wish I could say I sympathize, but gosh damn it, it's a rite of suffering that I can sit back and enjoy others go through.",

            "comment": "A Caltech alum from a few years ago wrote an open letter titled \"Why Caltech Is Different\" It covers most of the stuff you want to know.\n\n&gt;Caltech Open Letter: v1.0\n\n&gt;10/9/08\n\n&gt;Dear Prospective Caltech Students:\n\n\n&gt;This letter will mainly address what makes Caltech different from institutions of similar academic caliber. I won\u2019t spend a lot of time discussing our top-notch academics, famous alumni, exciting research at the professorial/grad level, etc. because these things do not differentiate Caltech from other schools you might be considering.\nWith that in mind, what is different about Caltech?\n\n&gt;Academics\n\n&gt;\u2022 Research\n\n&gt;o Caltech is known for its status as a research institution, but you may not know that getting involved in undergraduate research at Caltech is easier than at virtually any other university in the world. The 3:1 student-to-faculty ratio at Tech allows students to casually approach professors and discuss the possibility of working in a lab. Additionally, the SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship) program makes it almost trivial to do research over the summer; the majority of Techers participate in at least one SURF during their time here. In any case, I certainly feel that students at Caltech are in general given more opportunities to pursue significant research as undergraduates\u2014anecdotally, I work in a lab where I am allowed full access to equipment that at some other big research universities not even most graduate students are allowed to touch.\n\n&gt;\u2022 The Honor Code\n\n&gt;o Many schools have honor codes, but Caltech is one of the few schools where the honor code is an absolutely integral part of student life. The honor code is really simple: \u201cNo member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.\u201d It allows students to be given access to labs and equipment 24/7, it allows our exams to be almost all take-home, and it allows students to trust each other. A recent survey stated that 93% of Caltech undergraduates felt that the honor code was effective (i.e. it prevents students of taking unfair advantage of one another through means including but not limited to academic dishonesty). The honor code also lends to my next \u201cdifference\u201d: the noncompetitive nature of Caltech.\n\n&gt;\u2022 Collaboration\n\n&gt;o Caltech is special in that its curriculum encourages collaboration. The combination of mutual trust among students and the lenient collaboration policies of most homework assignments at Tech lead to students working together with high frequency. In my opinion, this really helps students get a better understanding of the material\u2014you get a chance to discuss the problems you\u2019re facing with other students. Even if you already know the material you are working on, sharing this knowledge with someone else really helps cement it in your mind. Additionally, the low-competition environment makes work a lot less stressful\u2014for the most part, you\u2019re just concerned about understanding the material, not necessarily scoring higher than your peers.\n\n&gt;Non-Academic Life\n\n&gt;\u2022 The House System\n\n&gt;o The House System is the primary social hub of students\u2019 lives at Caltech. I really like the house system because it allows students to live in small (houses usually contain somewhere between 100-150 members) tight-knit environments that are comfortable and supportive. The houses are like co-ed fraternities in many ways: students join houses through a rush-like process called rotation, once you join a house you stay a member for your time here, many social events are organized through the house, etc. Of course, there are also a few noticeable differences worth mentioning: no hazing and all students who want to live in a house have the option to. It\u2019s hard to summarize the house system here\u2014I could write another entire letter on the subject\u2014but it is one of my favorite things about Caltech. I think many Techers feel the same way\u2014and this is evidenced by interactions between alumni. The first question they always ask each other is, \u201cWhat class?\u201d and the second is, \u201cWhat house?\u201d\n\n&gt;\u2022 General Student Environment\n\n&gt;o The student environment at Caltech is incredibly unique. There are many semi-related concepts that create this uniqueness, but only a few will be addressed here.\n\uf0a7 Students are incredibly well represented at Caltech. We have undergraduate teaching assistants, undergraduate representatives on undergraduate admissions, a strong student government, and an administration that is content to let Techers for the most part police themselves. Our primary methods for dealing with bad conduct (whether academic or not) are run by students. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve grown to take for granted.\n\uf0a7 Because the school\u2019s curriculum is so focused, and the admissions process is based almost entirely on a student\u2019s ability to do well here academically, students here are surrounded by their intellectual peers. It\u2019s quite nice to be able to converse easily with any of your friends about your research/classes and have them not only be able to understand the subject of interest to a reasonable extent but also appreciate the knowledge they gain from the conversation.\n\uf0a7 Pranks!\n\n&gt;If you\u2019ve read this far, you should have a pretty good idea of how Caltech is different from its peer institutions. Even armed with this knowledge, you might wonder if Caltech is the right fit for you. The best way to discover this is to visit the school; something I would strongly recommend. Below I have provided some [highly subjective] supplemental tips that can help you decide if Caltech is a good fit.\n\n&gt;You should probably not come to Caltech if:\n\n&gt;\u2022 You\u2019re obsessed with your GPA\n\n&gt;o Yes, you might be able to make a 4.0 at Caltech, but the odds are against you. By far the happiest people I know at Caltech are those who came in with the expectation that they would do their best and then take the GPA they received.\n\n&gt;\u2022 You care more about being a doctor/lawyer than you do about learning math/science for learning\u2019s sake\n\n&gt;o Anecdotally, medical school admission is more GPA-based than graduate school admission. As mentioned before, getting a high GPA at Caltech is harder than at many other institutions, so as you might imagine it might take more effort to get into med school from Caltech than from other schools. That being said, there is a sizable number of students who attend med school from Caltech each year\u2014it\u2019s just that if your main goal is to attend med school, you can get in a lot easier from other institutions. Of course, if you\u2019re just as passionate about learning a lot and doing research as you are about going to med school, Caltech could work out great for you.\n\n&gt;o As for law school, given that Caltech has no prelaw major and limited courses in law coming here for prelaw doesn\u2019t make much sense unless you have a particular specialty of law in mind (for instance, possibly patent law).\n\n&gt;\u2022 One of your primary reasons for attending Caltech is the prestige\n\n&gt;o Yes, we\u2019re in the top ten on US News. No, we\u2019re not like any other school on the rankings. Not even MIT. Unless you like the idea of five terms of required physics (mechanics, e&amp;m, waves, quantum, thermo), five terms of required math (proof-based calc, linear algebra, multivariable, ode/pde, stats), two terms of chemistry, etc. If your idea of a dream school is Harvard, you should think very hard about whether Caltech is the school for you. There are people at Harvard who would do well here, but definitely not the majority.\nAs you might have heard, Caltech is very hard. You can take difficult classes at many schools you might apply to, but only at Caltech are you required to take many difficult classes no matter your major. Let me address two misconceptions related to this:\n\n&gt;\u2022 I got into Caltech, but I don\u2019t think I can handle it.\n\n&gt;o If you got into Caltech, you can handle it, period. Admissions does not admit anyone incapable of doing the work. The question you need to ask yourself is, \u201cDo I want to do all of this work?\u201d If the idea of learning all you can learn (and then a little bit more) excites you, then Caltech might be right for you. If you view college as just means to an end (even if the \u2018end\u2019 is grad school) or a four-year party, Caltech is probably not right for you.\n\n&gt;\u2022 Caltech won\u2019t be too much harder than high school\n\n&gt;o As I mentioned above in the paragraph about GPA obsession, a big part of being happy at Caltech involves adjusting to life here. The work is very difficult, and it sometimes seems endless. If you are a prospective student reading this, you were probably at the top of your class in high school. At Caltech, you probably will not be. We were all at the top of our class in high school. These things aren\u2019t bad (and in fact can be pretty good) but you must adjust to them. You must be capable and willing to manage your expectations of yourself.\n\n&gt;I hope that this letter has provided some insight to you that you might not be able to find in a pamphlet or in a campus tour.",

            "comment": "So much great material has been posted that I'm not going to try to add too much more, but as a Caltech junior, here are some things I think might be valuable for you to know:\n\n1) Caltech's social life is all about the House system, as people have described. Really. It binds everyone together and permeates pretty much your whole life here. But that's not to say that it's a bad thing -- it's far and away my favorite part of being here, and has connected me with more friends than I can count...\n\n2) I'd like to clarify the point that other posters have made about Caltech being more introverted than even MIT: this is true to a degree (as a community, we're certainly well-contained within our own bubble -- we're definitely introverted in that sense), but people individually vary like... well, like normal people vary, from quiet to loud and shy to oh-my-god-I-just-want-to-sleep-stop-banging-on-my-door.\n\n3) The close-knit House culture is tightly linked with Caltech's other big (and relatively unique feature): an Honor Code that we actually care about. It reflects itself in simple things, like people sharing longboards and not being afraid to store them in the hall, or people entrusting each other to turn in their sets (and not destroy or forget or copy them) when they've finally finished and desperately need to get some sleep. But, in my eyes, it's resulted in a general culture that doesn't feel hostile or competitive in the slightest -- which is pretty important at a school as intense as this one!\n\nThat last one, I think, is the most relevant for your application. At least my year -- and probably yours too -- there was an essay dedicated to the honor code. I know it's a difficult essay to write (odd subject and material) -- do what you can -- but whatever you do, don't trivialize it. It doesn't matter too much what you write about as long as you convince Admissions that you do actually care about -- and that you can actually handle -- the honor code.\n\nBest of luck!\n",

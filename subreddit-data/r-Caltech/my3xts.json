    "postText": "Hello \ud83d\udc4b \n\n(For those willing to read and comment on my post, thank you so much!!)\n\nSo I\u2019m currently stuck between Caltech and Stanford, and I would love to read a Caltech chemistry major talk about their experiences\u2014especially those who recently graduated or are seniors! \n\n- How did Caltech help you decide what type of chem you wanted to specialize in?\n- What types of research opportunities are available?\n- Are there joint research projects with other departments? If so, what is your favorite so far?\n- What do you like/dislike about Caltech\u2019s chem department?\n- What are your job prospects and starting salary if you don\u2019t mind?\n- What is your favorite tradition/part of student like that Caltech offers?\n- What are dorms like?!\n- Any fun/sad experiences in general?\n\n*I just want a student perspective, especially a chem major\u2019s since I don\u2019t really know how to know more about that. Thanks again for the help!!\n\nEDIT: \nCaltech- $32650/yr\nStanford - $24,500/yr\n\n(In case anyone asks)",

            "comment": "I'm just over two decades out from a Caltech BS in chemistry and now work in a completely different industry, so you might want to compare this with more recent students or graduates.\n\nThe chemistry department is pretty good about introducing each year's incoming freshmen to the various PIs and the work in their respective laboratories through the Frontiers in Chemistry seminar series (Ch 10 abc).\n\nIf you find a certain professor's work to your liking, you might be able to work in their laboratory during the school year and get paid over the summer via SURF. For rising sophomores who didn't place into OChem their freshman year, getting sufficient traction to be productive for a summer SURF project might be a bit harder, but I don't think this will necessarily stop a motivated student.\n\nOverall, the research gamut in chemistry and chemE is decently broad and there's plenty of opportunities for undergraduates to get into research very early in their careers, especially via SURF. You're certainly welcome to do research outside of your option and there's a good bit of cross-department collaboration. When I was there,  remember seeing my advisor (J.D. Roberts) spending a good deal of his time working with a friend on astrophysics simulations. Some undergraduates can even get a first-author paper out before graduating. Compared to Stanford or the Ivies, I think the main downside is that Tech is hyper-focused on research (for pretty much every department). This means that teaching quality can be spotty at times. It also means that unless you put in your own effort, you might not be as plugged into industry and start-up circles going to Caltech as you might elsewhere. That's not to say that the connections that you can make at Caltech aren't valuable in themselves, just that it's not really quite as much a place for being introduced to captains of industry or getting in on the ground floor of the latest and greatest tech startups.\n\nIf you're thinking of climbing the ladder in chemistry in academia or industry, you're likely looking at at least another 6-8 years of graduate school and a postdoctoral fellowship. Like most other sciences these days, eventually getting to a tenured faculty position can be a long and competitive process. I'm not sure what the going pay rates are now, but when I graduated, graduate stipends and fellowships were substantially below what was offered for entry-level positions in software engineering (for which a Caltech education is really overkill if you had a few CS classes and some software development experience outside of simply classwork, which is increasingly normative for a lot of contemporary research).\n\nAs to remote learning and/or dorm life and traditions, I'm going to defer to current or recently graduated students, as I'm pretty sure that my distant memories as an old boy are unlikely to be too helpful in there here and now.",

            "comment": "hi im currently a chem junior!\n\n\\- doing research + taking interesting classes helps w figuring out what kinda chem u like. ig a lot of people have some sort of idea before coming in, but you can always try working in different labs to try things out. also, chem major requirements are chill enough that you def have room for random classes that interest you.\n\n\\- as others have said, getting into chem research is super feasible. several profs don't have course prereqs for working in their groups so you could start as early as during frosh year. there's also summer research as part of the surf program, and that's really fun! \n\n\\- yeah, joint research projects exist. for example, i've been doing pchem research for planetary science purposes, and i'm sure other kinds of joint projects exist (especially cs-related stuff, i bet).\n\n\\- chem department has lots of cool profs and cool classes to take (though i guess your definition of cool may be different from mine), and i've met a lot of really nice people in those classes! however, since caltech is p small, you may find that a class you're interested in is only offered every other year/???? never?? and so you miss out on the class. this has only happened to me once so far though, so it's def not a big concern.\n\n\\- i'm planning to apply to grad schools in the fall. i think most chem majors go to grad school because \\*research noises\\*, so idk much about job prospects. ik career fairs often have a few chem-related companies there, but thats not something ive ever checked out",

            "comment": "Was a PhD student in a chemistry group (wasn't a chemistry student).  \n\\- Collaboration across disciplines in easy and natural at Caltech due to its small size.   \n\\- Caltech's chem department is quite good. Quals take a bit of time, but prepare you well for the future.  \n\\- Caltech has on campus apartments next to campus for cheap (around $650/month if I recall correctly). Because of demand, you're on guaranteed on campus housing for a year (then it's a lottery system).   \n\\- I work as a data scientist at a large tech company. Caltech slants toward pure/theoretical research. Stanford has stronger connections to startups and the tech industry. But, really, they're both great schools and either is a good choice.   \n\\- For Stanford in particular, check how current grad students are getting by on $24.5k/yr. I would guess that it is roommates and/or dorms. Rents are currently cheap in Palo Alto, but they will likely return to pre-COVID levels over the next year or two as Google/Facebook employees return the office.",

But thank you so much for the valuable input as an alumni\u2014I really appreciate your distinction between the two schools!! \n\nThanks also for just taking the time to read the post, take care!!",

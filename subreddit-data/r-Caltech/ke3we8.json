People say you need to pretty much have straight As, a perfect SAT/ACT, research experience, etc.... How true are these things? Can you get into caltech with a few Bs? What do you think would make an applicant stand out? What do you think made YOU stand out?",

            "comment": "Hey there!\n\nI\u2019m currently a first-year student, and I\u2019m here to tell you that I wasn\u2019t the perfect applicant. I\u2019ll list my stats and things below to help you get a better picture.\n\nMy high school uses the semester system and I had 6 classes each semester; at the time of my application, I received a total of 42 grades, of which 7 were B and the rest were A. 1 B came from first semester sophomore year, 1 from first semester junior year, 3 from second semester junior year, and 2 from first semester senior year.  At the end of my junior year, my class rank was 33/550, and I imagine it went lower after my two B in first semester senior year. Something that might be important though: of those 7 B grades, 1 was in AP Psychology, 2 were in AP Calculus AB (though I later took BC in first semester senior year and got an A), 1 was in AP World History, 2 were in Mandarin, and 1 was in AP Literature. My science classes were honors biology, honors chemistry, AP Physics 1, AP Physics C.\n\nOn the SAT, I got 800 Math, 740 English, 21 Essay for a total of 1540. On the ACT I got 36 Science, 36 Math, 35 English, 32 Reading, 10 Essay for a composite of 35. SAT Subject Physics 780; SAT Subject Math II 790 (though IIRC they\u2019re removing the SAT Subject requirement).\n\nI\u2019ve never done any research ever. I\u2019ve applied to several summer programs but I never got any; I guess I was just bad at writing applications before senior year lol\n\nSo, as you can see, even though my test scores were pretty great, my grades were not that amazing compared to everyone else. And it probably didn\u2019t help that I didn\u2019t do any research beforehand. But if I had to guess, what got me in was my application essays (though I guess technically it\u2019s my extracurriculars). Without going too much into detail, on the common essay I was able to story-tell how I led my Science Olympiad team through its darkest times (and let me tell you, those were some dark times...). I was also able to explain what the sequence of events had on me, why I wanted to go to college, and what I wanted to do in life. I think this essay was what got me in. Sometimes I go back to read it and I\u2019m just utterly amazed at how I was actually not only able to do what I said in my essay, but also write it in 650 words. (If you get in, I\u2019ll be more than happy to tell you my story, so remind me when you do! \ud83d\ude42) The supplements were also pretty fun to write! I remember Caltech and Stanford having the most fun prompts. \n\nI hope this was meaningful to you, and I hope you will see that colleges aren\u2019t looking for academic robots; they\u2019re looking for humans with a passion and a reason for why they want to go to a college and why that college should pick them. I certainly wasn\u2019t anywhere near an academic robot with straight A\u2019s.\n\nIf you have anymore questions you can message me and I\u2019ll reply. I wish you the best of luck in applying! :)",

I was accepted EA as part of the Class of \u201824. \n\nI\u2019m gonna mention a few things that I think helped me stand out in my application:\n\nMy high school was a middle college high school, meaning I was dual enrolled at a community college. I graduated with 5 Associate\u2019s degrees and straight A\u2019s, with the exception of a C in my first physics class (ik, I\u2019m not the best at physics but I\u2019m at Caltech, go figure). \n\nI did do research at a program at Viterbi (USC) the summer before my senior year called SHINE. One of my letters of rec came from my mentor here, which I think definitely helped. \n\nMy standardized test scores were pretty average for Caltech admits: SAT 790 math, 750 english. SAT Subjects: 800 Math II and 720 Physics. \n\nI had a few extracurriculars and leadership experience, yada yada. \n\nI think what truly made me stand out was my essays (and possibly the research experience). I had a friend in high school with better grades, better extracurriculars.....but no research experience and a generic essay. He wasn\u2019t admitted to Caltech. I was very vulnerable in my essay, and I\u2019m still really proud of how they turned out. \n\nOverall, I let my application and essays show who I am; including my passion for science. You\u2019ve probably seen this on this sub before, but Caltech admissions doesn\u2019t make mistakes. Yes, my first term was hard as hell, but I survived and learned SO MUCH. If you\u2019re meant to be here, be yourself and don\u2019t worry too much about your stats. Admission is holistic for a reason. \n\nBest of luck applying, and feel free to PM me with any other questions. :D",

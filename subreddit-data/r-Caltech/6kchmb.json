Aside from playing sports, I have competitive grades and scores and I love science and technology.\n\nTo anyone who knows about athletics at Caltech:\nHow intensive is the training and is it difficult to balance studies and athletics?\n\nI know Caltech is one of the most difficulty schools to graduate from and I wanted to know how manageable it is.\n\n",

It's a way to work into shape, and we ran 2-a-days and 3-a-days because there wasn't anything else to do.  For the 3-a-days we would do 9-12 then 3-5 and 7-9 or something like that.\n\nOnce school started, we just practiced 4-6 every week day.  We'd have games Saturdays mostly with some Sundays.  It wasn't too rough and helps to keep you on a schedule.\n\nI had friends in other athletics programs and during the school year they'd have to do morning AND afternoon practice during week days.\n\nThe coaches are under no illusions - you're there to learn and it's a D-III program.  Caltech also lets anyone that WANTS to play play a sport.  So practices run the full range of folks from people who have played varsity in high school to someone that's never played before.\n\nIt's totally manageable to do it, but you really don't have much time to screw around though.

            "comment": "It depends on which sport you're doing probably. When I was on track my frosh year, pretty much every Saturday was completely taken up by a meet, and from about 3:30 to 6:30 I was at practice or in the training room on weekdays. It lasted for a few months, but I would say the only effect it had on my academics was that occasionally I'd have to work on sets during meets (since there's a lot of sitting around). I think I actually took one of my finals in between races...\n\nIt's definitely manageable, but some sports are more time consuming than others. Basketball is definitely the most time intensive.",

But I imagine on practice days there's a little more time you have to spend since you're getting in/out of the pool and whatnot.\n\nHowever, track never had morning practices or more than one practice a day, which might happen for swimmers. I'm not 100% sure.",

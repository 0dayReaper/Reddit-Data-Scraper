    "postText": "Hi all\n\nI am coming here for my graduate study. In graduate courses, homework worth like 70~80% of the grade.  However, in many course syllabus, the instructors point out that \"collaboration is encouraged\" when doing these homeworks. If you collaborate, you must indicate the names of person you are working with and also write out the solution independently.  \n\nWhen I did my Bachelor, I almost always study by myself. ( I think group study is very inefficient because sometimes people are getting off-topic and start chatting about non-homework related stuff).   In addition, there are always be a person or two not contributing positively toward the discussion (they are just there because they want to copy solution off the smart ones). \n\nAnd lastly, collaboration can very often lead to plagiarism. \n\n\nI am wondering how collaborating feels like in Caltech (from your own experience), and will it lead to cheating/plagiarising?",

If someone hasn't told you, I'm glad to be the first but \"welcome to the real world.\" There will always be collaboration for the rest of your life from here on out, and that is not bad at all. People will talk about other stuff, and dick around and 99% of the time you will feel like you are pulling all the weight, it sucks but get over it. Maybe learn to make friends with them that way the \"chatting about non-homework related stuff\" is fun for you.\n\nAs for plagiarism, do you mean that someone will pull a solution from the internet or from some outside source? Or do you mean someone won't do shit and then copy your solution as their own? For the first you can just rat them out and the professor can deal with it (you'll be able to tell real easy something was copied). And for the second  you can rat them out and the professor will deal with it. It sucks, but it doesn't happen enough to worry about it so much. ",

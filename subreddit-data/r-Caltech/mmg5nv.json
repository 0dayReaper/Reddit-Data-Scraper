    "postText": "I started as a Lab Assistant at Caltech back in July, but due to covid I feel really out of the loop about a lot of aspects of this job. I don't even know where to direct my questions about overtime or vacation days -- other than to the HR staff of course. It's pretty easy to write an email and find out what the \"rules\" are or whatever but I would also love to meet another lab assistant who knows the ropes and would be willing to help me get familiar with the professional culture here at Caltech. I'm also interested in what grad students expect from their lab assistants, and what I can do to be as helpful as possible.",

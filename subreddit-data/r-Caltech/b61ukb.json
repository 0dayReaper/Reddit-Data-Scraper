    "postText": "I posted on here before the school year started asking whether I should live in Bechtel or a house. I got some super heated responses and inadvertently started a few debates, which really wasn't my intention, but was informative anyway. I honestly didn't get it at all as a prefrosh but now that I'm a part of Booty house, I totally do get why some people would feel like their house is a huge part of their life. \n\nI'm a semi socially awkward person (like most students here), but being part of a house really does mean free friendship and community. Unless you're unable to find any groups in the house you get along with, it's easy to have a circle that you can lean on. I will say that a lot of shit goes down in Booty house so it is kinda hard to get work done (sucks that I'm on grades next term) but the people in my house are basically my family. \n\nI don't know about the most work-conducive environment--I think that really depends on the house / residence too--but honestly being in a house let me meet people that are probably gonna be my friends for the rest of my 4 years here. I'm still worried about grades and my GPA, and at times I wish I lived in a less rowdy house. I can definitely see why being alone at breakdown hour would be awful, and I can also see why a lot of people in Booty house basically only do work in libraries. There's still pros and cons to both living situations, but I think I understand them more deeply now. Basically, it's far from perfect, but I understand why people were defending the house system so hard back when I posted.",

I'm also still a full member of my first choice.\n\nHonestly, I really enjoy living in a suite. I'm living with five other frosh who are members of other houses. I still get the perks and events of being part of a house while also having the opportunity to spend time with people I feel like I otherwise wouldn't have the chance to meet, them preferring other houses and such. And just because I am a part of Bechtel doesn't make me feel any less excluded-- the people of my house welcome me with open arms whenever I go over. I now have two supportive families I can rely on-- my suitemates and my house. And honestly, I can see myself staying close friends with my suitemates for all four years.\n\nA lot of people look down on Bechtel, thinking it doesn't work with the house system. But honestly, if you feel any less included in your house whenever you visit because you live with Bechtel, I feel like that doesn't say anything about Bechtel, but more about the house. I'm very happy with where I am now :)",

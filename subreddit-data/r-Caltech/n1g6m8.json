    "postText": "Hello! I am applying for a PhD next year and I am interested in quantum information science! I was wondering what groups at CalTech work on hardware such as transmons, ion traps, and photonics qubits, and the groups that work on more theory such as error correction, control, and complexity. \n\nI was also wondering if it is advised that I apply for physics or EE PhD at CalTech if I wish to pursue something related to condensed matter, or spintronics, or optical physics. \nI have some side interests in particle physics, ML, and control theory.",

Caltech is pretty fluid in terms of groups accepting students from almost any department so I would apply to the department you think you are most likely to be admitted by and worry about the rest later.",

I\u2019ll provide my insight as well.\n\nOn the theory side, there\u2019s primarily John Preskill and Fernando Brandao. Manuel Endres\u2019s group pursues some theory projects, but they are primarily experimental. All of those guys are in the physics department; perhaps there\u2019s others in other departments I\u2019m missing.\n\nI\u2019m less familiar with the experimental side of things, but the groups that come to mind are Stevan Nadj-Perge and Oskar Painter. The latter of them is actually in the applied physics department.\n\nAs for which department: I know nothing about the EE department here, but if you have those other interests than it may be worthwhile to come in as physics - you should also consider applying for applied physics as well (if you\u2019re interested in experiments).\nThat said, it\u2019s not very difficult to work with advisors in different departments, and it\u2019s even possible to switch, so it\u2019s not the end all be all (though I suspect going EE -&gt; Physics is probably harder than going the other way)",

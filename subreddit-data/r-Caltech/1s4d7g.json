            "comment": "[Sean Carroll](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VFGuupXwng) fits your bill perfectly (astrophysicist, popular expositor). But he already does a lot of this kind of stuff, and has a very hectic schedule, so he will likely be unavailable.\n\nIf you're willing to look beyond astrophysics, [John Preskill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XbQpUtqgnU) is a great lecturer. He works in the area of quantum computing, although in the past he's also worked on topological charges, general relativity, and quantum field theory. Also, I've always found Jim Eisenstein to be very engaging. The only relevant video I can dig up is a [colloquium talk](http://www.physics.wisc.edu/vod/2010/09/24.html), but I've no doubt he would do a great job with a general audience. He works in experimental condensed matter, basically trying to produce unusual quantum states of matter in the lab. Edit: [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiF_sSECeiM) quick Jim Eisenstein video.\n\nI'm sure there are other good lecturers in Astrophysics. To be honest it's just an area that never really caught my attention, so I'm less familiar the people working in it.\n\nHope this helps.",

                    "comment": "Hi! Thanks so much for responding.\n\nI'm working on producing a series of informal science lectures for non-scientists to be put on in a bar in LA. I am seeking lecturers who are excited about their field &amp; can communicate with the average person about their work in an engaging way. Think Neil DeGrasse Tyson esque.\n\nI'm wondering if you could tell me who the most popular (or your favorite) professors are at Caltech. I have been researching online looking for professors &amp; researchers who work in the fields that I'm trying to cover but it's difficult to tell if someone is an engaging and excited lecturer from their university bio or personal website. I'm looking for someone like yourself to help guide me towards people who will make good guests for this series.\n\nWe're looking for talks on the big bang &amp; the CMS, Galaxy formation, black holes, the expanding universe, and how stars collapse to create the matter that makes up our world, Dark Matter &amp; Dark energy.\n\nI'm quite open to a wide variety of topics provided the speaker is engaging &amp; excited.  \n\nFYI, I am not a scientist. I am a composer for film &amp; television who is passionate about science and who has a fair amount of event organizing experience. For me this is an opportunity to learn more about the world around us and the universe we live in while helping to get the general public more engaged in the amazing science happening now in particle physics and astrophysics.\n\nI'd be grateful for any kick in the right direction you might be able to provide.",

I will definitely ask upperclassmen what they think, though. \n\nWhat sort of depth are you looking for in talks? For example, if they're fairly layman-oriented, you could probably reach out to grad students or even upperclassmen in undergrad to give those types of talks.\n\nPersonally, almost everyone I know has really enjoyed physics 1a with [Ryan Patterson](http://www.hep.caltech.edu/~rbpatter/), an assistant professor whose research is in astroparticle physics. He has a very engaging lecturing style with a lot of demos, and I know his was definitely the class that I enjoyed the most this term.\n\nHope that helped, and if you have any other questions I'd be glad to answer them.",

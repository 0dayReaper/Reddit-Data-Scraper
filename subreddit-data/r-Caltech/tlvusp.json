I\u2019m going to be taking Georgia Tech Distance Math as a senior (Linear Algebra first semester and Multivariable Calculus second semester) and I just want to know what level of math did people admitted into Caltech do. Some of my friends are already in the GT class as juniors and going to be taking GT 2 (Differential Equations/Combinatorics) as seniors.",

            "comment": "While it's \"fine\" to only have taken Calc AB as a few posters have commented, those who have taken higher level math like multivariable or diff eq do have a competitive advantage when it comes to taking core math, as it's more of a refresher. Caltech makes you relearn calculus in a very proof based manner, so whatever calculus you learned in high school matters a bit less.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m gonna go with the counterpoint that AB is not really enough math to be comfortable at Caltech. BC senior year should be the minimum, since you need a lot of those concepts for Ph1a and maybe even ch1a. The math courses here also won\u2019t really teach you proper numerical methods for integration, and you\u2019ll have to learn it while doing other classes, which can be kinda rough. \n\nPast that however, it\u2019s mostly just gravy. Learning some mv Calc is useful for when you need it in physics second term, and knowing how matrices work will make understanding our linear algebra a bit better, but unfortunately it\u2019s pretty hard to place out of our math courses. \n\nFor me personally, I took BC sophomore year, mv/linalg junior year, and a topics course that covered most of discrete math and some other fun stuff senior year.",

I'd say BC is definitely necessary as a minimum to be comfortable with the level of math taught at Caltech, so you should be totally fine. I think taking Linear and Multivariable is a good idea, because even if you don't place out of those classes, you'll have a good background going in.",

It was the second level AP Physics class -- I took the first one in junior year, and I don't remember the naming system because it was &gt;20 years ago. I probably should have taken college-level math in senior year because I was all rusty by the time I got to Caltech, but I'm not sure how much it would have really helped because I never learned strong thinking skills or rigorous proofs. They weren't necessary to do well in AP classes, on AP exams, or on SATs.",

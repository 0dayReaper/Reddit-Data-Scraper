I'm trying to see whether or not the stipend for my PhD reflects the costs of living in Pasadena.\n\nIf anyone could provide some sort of a breakdown, I'd really appreciate it!\n\nThank you!! :)",

            "comment": "I never calculated my budget, but the [Caltech grad office has an estimate](http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/financialsupport/budget). (The tuition should be paid as part of your package, so that number doesn't really matter to you; look at the subtotals.)\n\nAnecdotally: Pasadena's cost of living is pretty high, but so is the grad stipend. If you're single, you can probably afford to live in an on-campus double or quad (Catalina apartments) on a grad stipend. The only grad students I know who lived in a single (on campus or off) had outside help. It's pretty hard to support a non-working spouse and/or family on the stipend, but a couple of my friends have managed it with really tight budgeting. \n\nI saw you on the MIT thread as well. I did my undergrad at MIT, and grad school at Caltech. It's not a perfect comparison since I was in different stages of education, but the cost of living seemed pretty similar between the 2. The biggest difference is that in Pasadena you'll probably want a car\\*. At MIT, you might be able to do without one, depending on how close to the T you live and how much you're ok with biking in the snow. On the flip side, a wide range of fresh fruit/veggies are available year round in Pasadena, while Boston was more limited.\n\n\\*Some people will claim that you can get around Pasadena without a car. While this is technically true, you're going to be pretty limited to campus and walks to the grocery store. I started out as the only one in my grad cohort with a car. By the end of the 2nd year, every single person in my cohort had bought a (used, usually) car.  The rare few without a car tend to be avid bikers and/or avoid socializing.",

    "postText": " I am struggling immensely to choose between these options. My research  interests are in crystal growth and thin film expitaxy with applications  to functional and quantum materials. After grad school, I have  ambitions of staying in academia, taking either a postdoc or faculty  position. Personality wise, I enjoy the grind (Berkeley undergrad) but I  recognize that life is more than work. I want time to hike, bike, go to  the gym, meet girls occasionally, have friends in my cohort, ski once  in a while come wintertime, etc. Without this balance, I know I will  burn out fast (as I essentially/almost did in undergrad).\n\nHere are my perceived pros and cons of both programs...\n\n**Caltech Pros:**\n\n* New PI: Presents an opportunity to learn how to set up a lab and gain skills and insight needed to succeed in academia.\n* The  new PI is very well connected and already well respected. His research  is absolutely insane and very physics-ish, just the way I like it.\n* Group already has some equipment set up, and has the ability to grow materials in limited capacity now.\n* Freedom:  the new group presents a blank slate, and the PI is encouraging me to  choose a project I will be very interested in (pretty amazing). I will  basically co-found this lab.\n* Caltech  likes to solve complex problems that are really \"out there.\" I'm  hopping this means Caltech will be an opportunity to do unique research  and sculpt my own niche field.\n* Caltech is stressful, but pressure makes diamonds (Berkeley for sure taught me this, the hard way).\n* San  Gabriel and San Burnadino mountains absolutely rock. I grew up hiking  and skiing there, and would be excited to have that opportunity again.\n\n**Caltech Cons:**\n\n* New  lab will be a ton of work and risk. Time to set everything up could  result in delayed graduation, low output of results initially, PI may  not receive tenure, etc.\n* I  have heard that people at Caltech only talk science and atmosphere is  very intense. I tend to get along with people who love science but are  well rounded and can talk about anything (sports, girls, beer, life in  general). Without that, I will feel very isolated and I could see my  work suffering.\n* Overall, I've heard collaboration is low, and I'm worried about a high intensity and low socialization environment.\n* Everyone at SB talked about work/life balance and importance of nature, while nobody at Caltech did.\n* Urban  environment, need to drive to escape. Right now, I can hop on my bike  in Berkeley and be surrounded by Redwoods within minutes. At Caltech, it  might take a little more effort to escape in nature.\n\n**UCSB Pros:**\n\n* Established  PI's: Have several MBE systems ready to go, amazing user facilities,  amazing track records churning out world-class research and graduates.\n* Ridiculous amount of collaboration and a Quantum Foundry with cutting edge research.\n* Lower  risk environment. UCSB vibe is \"you can choose what kind of researcher  you want to be. If you want to grow, characterize, and write tons of  papers, you can. If you want to ease up, you can. The PI's need to make  funding contracts, but their jobs aren't on the line and their groups  are well equipt and staffed.\"\n* Grad school is stressful enough. Being in a relaxing place like SB where even the PIs are very chill screams \"balance\" to me.\n* Everyone  at SB talked about work/life balance and importance of nature, while  nobody at Caltech did. Biking to lab along the coastline...can't beat  that! Environment is less urban, and escaping to nature is as simple as  walking down to the beach.\n\n**UCSB Cons:**\n\n* Too  lax/not enough push? Sometimes a kick in the ass and being face to face  with the PI is a good thing (not a fan of negative reinforcement  though). Maybe intensity is a good thing, especially if my aim is to  become a PI myself.\n* Labs  are like well oiled machines. Will be obligated to work on  well-established materials, making it less likely that I will have an  opportunity to develop a niche field and contribute unique ideas during  grad school.\n* San  Gabriel &gt;&gt;&gt; Los Padres, but this is a very small objection  (and probably insignificant). What's more important is that I'm closer  to good skiing mountains in LA.\n\ntldr; caltech = risky/huge reward and stressful/non-social, SB = safe/fair reward and more relaxed",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t speak for UCSB all that much, but I can address some of your points here.\n\n- I\u2019m not an experimentalist, but my understanding is that joining a brand new lab is actually a really good opportunity. This PI made it to Caltech, so he\u2019s obviously very good at what he\u2019s doing (as you have indicated) - so I would say there\u2019s really not much risk in joining a new lab here. On the other hand, yes things will be slow at first and you won\u2019t be able to pump out results right away, but you\u2019re helping build this lab from the ground up - everything is *your* work. That\u2019s a pretty nice plus \n- The environment here is pretty intense; most people live and breathe their work, and talk science all the time. That said, there\u2019s plenty of well-rounded people with exciting hobbies - I\u2019ve been able to make friends here and do plenty of social things. You may have a little trouble coaxing people away from their labs, but it\u2019s definitely doable!\n- There is an *avid* outdoors community here at Caltech - from mountain biking to surfing, hiking to rock climbing, skiing to trail running, there are people who do it. Not only that, but the people here tend to be social about it - people are always sharing their trips and plans with each other (usually done through the Caltech Alpine club or the Caltech Y). So if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, then Caltech is the right place! (I can\u2019t speak for UCSB, but based on its location I think it\u2019s be hard pressed to beat what Caltech has to offer)\n- Same with sports. I\u2019m a basketball player, and I\u2019ve actually been able to find a great group of guys to play with (pre-COVID, of course)\n- Yeah, you\u2019ll struggle a bit without a car, but it *is* doable - most of the things you need are here in Pasadena, and you can access Downtown LA via the metro (which is... not the best, but it works). There\u2019s also enough people here with cars that you can get by for longer/more exciting trips (I for one have a car, and am always down for a good hiking/camping/skiing trip). Also, for what it\u2019s worth, I feel like Goleta is worse than Pasadena in this regard - its a small town on the coast, with no major urban centers nearby (Santa Barbara really isn\u2019t that big)\n- The mountains do rock!! I personally learned to ski this season at Big Bear, so I get your excitement there!\n- I\u2019m not sure what department you\u2019d be in, but in physics, there\u2019s virtually no barriers to collaboration; most PIs actually encourage it (in fact, in condensed matter theory, the postdocs aren\u2019t even hired to a specific group - they\u2019re floaters). So your department may be more open to it than you realize \n- Again, I cant speak for your department, but I\u2019ve found a lot of the profs in condensed matter theory to be quite laid-back and low pressure. I do know some of the experimentalists can be more demanding, but the point is that just because they\u2019re a prof at Caltech doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re super demanding \n\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much \u201crisk\u201d in coming to Caltech, outside of your (valid) worries about work-life balance. I do think you\u2019d be fine, since your love of the outdoors fits in well with the community. You also have easy access to one of the largest cities in the world, so you\u2019d be able to find whatever else it is you want.\n\n\nHope this helps, and feel free to ask me any other questions!",

                    "comment": "I appreciate your reply! You honestly bring up a ton of amazing points that are leaning me further in the direction of Caltech.\n\nI definitely agree that since my PI made it to Caltech and received the full \"start up\" package, the lab is essentially set. I really like the aspect of everything being \"my work,\" that presents the opportunity to make an early mark on the field.\n\nI will probably have/get a car, and for sure would involve myself with the Y and Alpine club (and probably start playing baseball again in a local league). Also, I definitely agree that Goleta is more out of the way in terms of access to the San Gabriels, Sierras, deserts, etc.\n\nIt is awesome to hear that collaboration is common. I think part of the Caltech stereotype is that each lab is an \"island,\" but the PI I am slated to work with claims to collaborate a ton with the theorists and experimentalism in his building and the department. Good to hear that you can corroborate this account.\n\nTo some extent, I'm both worried about coaxing other people out of the lab **and** myself out of the lab. In my undergrad, I was definitely the person to choose the library over hanging out with friends and getting exercise, but after 2 years (I was a transfer) I have recognized that this balance was sometimes more harmful than helpful (for me at least). Naturally, it will take effort from me to restore that balance, but if you think that will be an uphill battle at Caltech, please do warn me in advance.\n\nThanks again!",

            "comment": "I was at a similarly rigorous school as UCB for undergrad, and was also choosing between UCSB and Caltech for grad school (as was a good friend). Are you looking at the Materials departments at both? A huge difference is the materials department at Caltech is really an applied physics department in disguise. Take a look at the classes you'll take, and it should give insight on what the department's flavor is like. \n\nSecond, I would look at which department has a second or third choice professor for yourself. What would you do if funding for the project you're supposed to be on falls through in your second/third year, if there's a serious personality conflict, or if your advisor gets hit by a bus? This is a much bigger problem with the limited faculty at Caltech vs a larger school like UCSB.\n\nBy the way, if you want to get to nature, you don't need to drive. There's public transit options that'll take you close to trails in the foothills. You're definitely a bit further from the beach in Pasadena (and it's not a really pleasant drive to get to any of them), but I guess it's closer than being in Ohio.\n\nIn terms of social at Caltech, I think it's a mixed bag. I had friends that would run marathons whenever there was a big one in town, would go running to Santa Monica, and took a month off to go backpacking in the mountains of India. A few friends were in a beer brewing club, and I did a beer-league softball team full of international students who had never thrown a baseball before. The Caltech Y has all sorts of outdoor equipment that can be borrowed and organizes group trips to various national parks. That said, there's definitely more focus on your day job than what you do on nights/weekends. Work/life balance heavily depends on lab, with the school, in general, not considering it their problem to make sure students don't go crazy. Most grad student events are aimed at first/second years and are just free food and lots of booze.\n\nIn the end, I went to Caltech, my friend went to UCSB, and both of us felt we made the right choice.",

Are there any major differences in your experience vs. your friend's experience that you've noticed?\n\nThere are some other options for where I can do similar research, granted it is limited because Caltech is small. I honestly have no idea what would happen to my funding if anything bad were to happen. I really doubt the department would just kick me to the curb, but it is something to consider.\n\nI will probably get/have a car, but it's good to know that public transit takes you to the foothills.\n\nDid you find that you were able to set \"ground rules\" with your PI in terms of setting boundaries between work and life? I'm not advocating for slacking off or anything like that, but having that verbal agreement may be beneficial to both parties.\n\nIt is reassuring to hear that grad students are able to be involved in real life activities like backpacking (especially for a whole month!). I will probably try to start playing baseball again, and would definitely make contacts with the Caltech Y and Alipine club folks.",

                            "comment": "Of all my undergrad friends, I was the only one that felt my grad classes were difficult. In materials there you take a year of math (proof-based), a year of quantum, a year of solid state physics, a year of thermo, and only, like, two actual materials classes (diffraction and transport). I think the course catalogue has expanded a little since I attended, but it's still a very physics-oriented program compared to most people doing materials. If you're interested in semiconductors that's probably not the worst thing. I was doing amorphous metals, so solid state was, well, completely irrelevant since it builds off the assumption of a repeating lattice.\n\nThe department mostly leaves it up to you to get your stuff done. There aren't many formal gates to clear other than your candidacy exam in your second year and then your final defense. Lots of other schools require quarterly meetings with your committee, multiple revisions of your thesis, etc. Caltech has none of that. Half my committee didn't even read past my first chapter, and my advisor didn't even open my thesis.\n\nAt first my PI was great because he suggested I just focus on classes (4 classes is a pretty full load), and not worry about research until my first summer other than coming to our randomly scheduled group meetings. By my second year, my advisor decided he was tired of writing proposals, so we basically ran out of money. I TAed a dozen times across nine classes (8 of them grad) to keep myself funded. I think my advisor attended my group meetings maybe twice across six years, and never stayed in town for my talks at conferences (he'd usually fly home after he gave his keynote in the first morning). He was world famous, pioneer of his field, still coming up with brilliant theoretical ideas, and genuinely a nice guy...but he was just tired of the churn of academic life and the requirements that came with it.\n\nIf you want to learn about the atmosphere of a certain lab, talk to both graduate students in the labs you're looking at, as well as other students in the program not in that lab. Often, students in really abusive relationships won't recognize it, and won't be able to tell prospectives how broken the lab culture is.\n\nI noticed the same thing you did about the difference between UCSB and Caltech, in that everyone at SB talked about the cool things they did on their weekends and very few focused on their research. Caltech was the opposite. I was someone who had few interests outside of school, and loved the labwork I had previously done, so I felt Caltech was definitely the right fit. What I'll say is that's a great path towards burnout, and you have to be sure to make you have a way of giving yourself time to recover.\n\nEdit: I should also say, if your prospective advisor doesn't have tenure, then you'll definitely want to keep a backup plan in the works as long as you're there. Caltech hasn't given tenure to some amazing faculty, and they have given it to some that are...................less than ethical. If your faculty leaves in your fourth year, you'll probably be able to stick around campus, but you'll need to find someone else's lab to finish up what you're interested in doing. If they have to leave in your third year, you're in a really tough spot and may be pushed to follow them or abandon your work to join a different faculty member's lab. That said, new faculty often have a lot more drive to publish and get stuff done asap, because their career is riding on early results. For that reason, they tend to also lean *very heavily* on their first students, because their work is critical to getting tenure.",

Proof based math is definitely my achilles heal, so that will be tough.

I do want to come in prior and research in the summer, so that will for sure help me get a jump start on research while balancing classwork.\n\nI spoke with the PI about his startup package, and it seems like he is fairly well funded for the time being. Regardless, I will apply for several fellowships as backups and to free up money for additional research.\n\nThe biggest risk for me is that the department is small and I will probably have to switch gears or transfer if my PI isn't tenured and/or leaves.

For someone like myself who was more interested in \"traditional\" materials science, it caused a lot of strife internally, as I felt I spent a ton of time working really hard in classes for stuff that wasn't what I really wanted to get better at. Like, I probably put in similar amounts of time per homework than I did in undergrad, but I also felt I learned way, way less per assignment. Pedagogy is not Caltech's strong suit by any measure; they put out extraordinary people because those are the only ones they bring in. As far as I saw TAing, they don't often make students better versions of themselves.\n\nAll that said, I would look at some of the other faculty at Caltech doing semiconductor work (or related modeling) and see if you can at least identify someone you'd like to have as a co-advisor. While young advisors can be fantastic, they can also be terrible (after all, managing people isn't what got them their job), and it's important for you to have someone more senior who can serve as a sounding board to make sure everything is operating within norms for your relationship. Also, keep in mind pretty much all the faculty there is incredibly intelligent, so even if they aren't doing *exactly* what you're doing, there's a good chance they still have really good insights or twists on it when combined with their background. For example, Bill Goddard has the reputation of sleeping through every guess lecturer's talk, waking up from the applause at the end, and then managing to ask that one question they didn't want asked (he's also a phenomenally nice guy).",

            "comment": "I would disagree with your assessment in general - Caltech is way less risk in this scenario because the brand name means that you could do meh work and still get a nice postdoc position afterwards on the brand-name/connections alone. New-PI is also less risky than an established PI because the biggest real risk in grad school is having a PI that just doesn't care about you or whether your projects succeed. You won't be getting a faculty position in this field straight out of grad school unless you win the lottery with a random discovery or a huge hype-wave in your super-specific research topic just as you are graduating - no point optimizing for this scenario at this point.\n\nIn this case, I know what groups you are talking about (used to be at Caltech materials, now am at UCSB), and the real answer here is to talk to the PIs and see who you get along with better. If you want to solely emphasize career success, look at what projects they offer you and do some scouting on which one is the most safe. As an experimentalist working on exotic materials (and everything in the field you described is going to be exotic), 99% of the work is fabricating a high quality experimental system in the first place. This is tedious, non-glorious work that usually takes a PhD (or two) to figure out. Then a new student comes in on the optimized system and writes all the flashy papers. If you just want to optimize for academic success in this particular field, your choice should be entirely determined by which PI is giving you a prime-time-ready experimental system (or one that is realistically almost there).\n\nRegarding work/life balance - this is more of a personal choice between you and your PI. You can burn out or have a very relaxed time at any institution, depending on what kind of PI you get and what personal choices you make. The Caltech vs UCSB stereotype is a minor blip compared to that.",

                    "comment": "This. This is what I needed to hear. Plus it's good that you know exactly who I'm talking about, that makes it much easier to compare.\n\nI have talked to two PI's at SB and one at Caltech many, many times. Both PI's at SB seem very easy to get along with and very approachable. I do like the fact that the new PI at Caltech is young and vibrant, but overall, they all are happy, easy to approach, and would be fun to work with/for.\n\nThe real difference is in how established the labs are. At Caltech, there are two MBE systems that are almost \"ready\" to go. It might take another few months to pressure down, but after that, I should expect to be growing. Of course, I anticipate that I will contribute by adding more chambers and/or characterization tools, but there should be some initial infrastructure there.\n\nAt SB, as you know, those labs have 5-7 MBE's ready to go. They still add infrastructure from time to time, but after I am trained on the MBE and UHV, there is nothing stopping me from accumulating results. Plus, SB has insane user facilities, but maybe you can elaborate on how they compare to Caltech?\n\nThere are probably a million questions I should ask you, but for the sake of simplicity, how would you say the vibe (intensity of students, stress level, ability to form boundaries between work/life, etc.) compares at SB and Caltech, especially for those who want to stay in academia? How do you think that same vibe influenced your success at Caltech in your PhD?",

                            "comment": "Both institutions have access to any and all equipment you might want. What you need to find out is what you'll be doing with that equipment - what are the research goals that you'll be working towards? Are you starting from scratch or building on an established literature, or better, previous experimental experience? How many other people are working on this same question, both in your immediate circle or collaborators, and in the world? Is this the kind of project that is only interesting if its 100% successful, or are there interesting things to learn along the way? Does the project involve you learning stuff, or twiddling with knobs hoping to strike gold?\n\nGood projects are rare, and hard to know ahead of time, but my priority order would be the last question (learning stuff), having a healthy (and large!) community to join, working on systems that are interesting even if they don't work as intended, and without other information, young PI who is invested in your success.\n\nMy experience has been that the difference between the \"vibe\" of graduate programs is insignificant. There is much more variance between groups and PIs in any given institute. \"Institution culture\" is mostly an undergrad thing, not relevant to grad. Career success in academia is determined by (1) luck, (2) your PIs connections, (3) jumping on a good project. Personal success depends on what you care about most, but I'd recommend just following the \"I want to actually learn things\" trail.\n\nEDIT: This is all hindsight by the way. The reason I picked the grad program that I did (not Caltech, was here for UG) was I liked their attitude towards letting me use their machine shop without requiring any training or oversight, from day 1.",

                                    "comment": "I suppose this my biggest uncertainty with Caltech. Yes, I could continue the research that got the PI to Caltech in the first place, but he has emphasized that he wants his students to choose projects they will be interested in. I take this to mean that we will be finding new projects together - in other words, there is no exact way to tell what equipment I will need and how I will use it, but I will for sure be immersed in constant learning and exploration.\n\nOf course, I have some ideas in my head (we all seem to). Will they work? Are they feasible? No clue yet. Do I have enough experimental background to know which measurements I should even do? Probably not. To people like us, this is both exciting and intimidating. But I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to spend the rest of my life learning, that is for sure!\n\nThe projects at SB are already good and established, and the community is pretty large. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Caltech AP/MS community is smaller but works together. There will be overlapping research but the key difference I see is that at SB, *what you see is what you get in terms of projects.* Caltech represents the unknown. For example, the PI and his grad student at Caltech indicated they are scouring the literature for new materials they can realize in 2D. In that respect, I think there will be a lot of learning from failures, and possibly a less stable network of collaborators globally since the projects are novel.\n\nTo sum everything up...\n\nSB: Have been told I will get the freedom to chose my own, unique (and hopefully good) project. But, these groups are more obligated to meet funding contracts, and so these projects will be analogous to what you can find on their websites now.\n\nCaltech: Totally up to me. There is an oxide and chalcogenide chamber in the lab now, but which projects I will use them for, no idea. All I know is what the PI did in his PhD and postdoc, but he seems to have no interest in dictating what projects I will run besides something that involves superconductivity, topological materials, and other exotic things that excite us all.\n\nEdit: In response to your edit, I don't know what the Caltech rules are on this, but I know the Caltech PI is a self-taught machinist and probably won't have a problem with me doing that. I know for a fact that (at least in one of the labs) at SB I will have quick machining opportunities.",

            "comment": "Like you, my grad school decision came down to Caltech vs UCSB as well. I'm not in your field (I'm doing theoretical physics) so I won't comment on your field specific questions, but here's what my pros and cons were, and here's how they played out. \n\nLike you, I really liked the fact that UCSB students seemed more \"well rounded\" and it seemed to me that UCSB students were less tied to their advisor than at Caltech (an option in theory, but probably not experiment) and there seemed to be a lot more collaboration. On the other hand, Caltech had a wider range of people doing the research I was interested in and frankly better physicists (at least in the field I was considering)\n\nI spoke to a lot of my undergrad professors about this, and the best peice of advice I got was a one line email \"go to Caltech, retire to UCSB\"\n\nSo I did. \n\nHere is how it played out for me. \n\nOn the academic side: I found out that the is a lot of collaboration, even some of my advisors best students were not really his students, they just worked together enough that it seemed like it. There are a lot of postdocs here that are really helpful and accessible. The department is small enough that even with covid happening for the last year and change, I already know more than 80 percent of the theory grad students, across the entire range of theorist physics. \n\nOn the extracurricular side: I have a very healthy work life balance and my advisor is really chill about it. (In part I was able to get such an advisor because called had so many good people that It wasn't hard to find a phenomenal physicist who is also an amazing human being) There are a lot of single minded, work focused people here, and that's them. But there are also a lot of well rounded people here too. Until covid happened, I had around 15-20 hiking friends. The Caltech Y has a ton of gear you can borrow for hiking and does multi day hiking trips. There is a large group of skiers/snowboarders that do serious trips out in the mountains. We went into LA for museums, restaurants and sightseeing. Not everyone here is one dimensional. \n\nCaltech is not lost in middle of a city, its a two hour walk (or hour-ish bus ride) to the base of the mountains, i.e. the angeles national forest. I've gone hiking there numerous times.\n\nI can't make the decision for you, and I don't know the counterfactual of what would've happened had I gone to UCSB, but I do not regret my decision.",

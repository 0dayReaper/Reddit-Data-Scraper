Turns out this mans schedule had been completely booked(yes you must schedule appointments just to hang out with him). Nonetheless, he was willing to stray from his strict sleep schedule to which he credits much of his success just to help me in a class he was not in. A true gentlemen. Through this experience it is natural for me to believe that word of Avyay would spread through the entire school even if Caltech were a far larger institution.",

I tried to stop him and get a picture, but I was star struck, fumbled my words, and he had more important things to do. I had to track him down. I lagged behind about 30 seconds, and followed back to his dorm room. I asked him for a photo and a link to one of his famous private Github repositories. He obliged and invited me into his room. The rest is history.",

    "postText": "I'll be doing SURF this summer and had a couple questions about general living. What are the kitchens in the dorms like in terms of what appliances they have/how big/crowded they are? The dining plan we need to buy isn't that much money (\\~400) and I usually cook for myself so I was hoping to do that too here. What's the general consensus on how good the dining hall food is? Also is there any campus service that lets you rent a mini fridge/a fb group where I can ask around for one? Lastly, I was hoping to get a general sense of what the campus environment is like in terms of the surrounding area - are restaurants/convenience stores/supermarkets walkable and popular options that students go to often? Also if anyone has any popular restaurant recs. I go to school in a city right now so just trying to get a sense of how to adjust my lifestyle :P",

            "comment": "The kitchens have oven, stovetop, fridge/freezer, microwave. There's also usually a couple other small appliances (toaster etc.) floating around.  Not *too* crowded; cooking regularly is very doable. (idk about Bechtel though, since it opened after I graduated.)\n\nThe dining plan lets you buy food at Chandler and the convenience store.  Chandler is usually pretty good, and $6-9 per meal.  The C-store is a bit overpriced.\n\nEasily walkable streets for shopping etc. are Lake to the east, and Colorado to the north.    The grocery stores (Pavillions, Trader Joes) are on Lake, and there's also a Target on Colorado. \n\nSome Pasadena restaurants I really miss: Pie n Burger, Amigo's, Tea Spots, Dog Haus, Congelato, and Zona Rossa.  \n\nOther pretty reliable places are Zankou Chicken, Chim!, Osawa Deli, Chipotle, Panda, Mako Bowl, Daisy Mint, Nine &amp; Nine, The Counter.\n\nDu-par's and Winchell's are open 24/7.\n\nThere's also some stuff in Old Pas, but its a bit out of the way, so usually I'd only go there if I had multiple things to do (e.g. get dinner + go to movie).\n\nUsing car/bus opens up many more possibilities, especially in the San Gabriel Valley.  In 'n Out, Dumpling House, Ramen Yukinoya, Golden Deli, Chengdu Taste, Factory Tea Bar, Gen KBBQ, Borneo Kalimantan, Carmela Ice Cream, Bhanu's...",

            "comment": "Adding on a few points to what was said:\n\n\\-You don't get that much money on the dining plan, but that's basically just for lunch - for breakfast there's open kitchen (a variety of cereals, yogurt, etc - if you want hot meals here you would need to spend dbal) and for dinner you can go to house dinners or bechtel dining hall. You're of course welcome not to, but it is included as part of the cost of board.\n\n\\-Most people pick up a mini fridge after their freshman year if they want one, since seniors who are graduating will leave theirs for others to take for free",

    "postText": "Hello friends,\n\nI am seeking to find some kind of description of the graduate cohort, for the Physics department (the particular year is less important). In the spirit of transparency, I am hoping to test the hypothesis that Cal Tech admits students from a wide range of undergraduate backgrounds into its graduate physics program. Of course, I already know that this is the most likely case, but finding some evidence would really help me put to bed the notion -- put forward by others, in other forums -- that only Ivy League and top international applicants are admitted. The strongest piece of evidence that I can think of would be some official Cal Tech document that lists all the many different undergraduate institutions grad students were admitted from. At least, we had something like this at my school, that we offered to the incoming class so they could see where their colleagues hail from (likely all over the place). I'm also happy to hear first-hand experiences about the diversity of the graduate student body. Alright.\n\nPeace,\n\n!mike",

I\u2019d guess at least half of the grad students in my division (including myself) come from run-of-the-mill public schools. Based on my experiences, Caltech doesn\u2019t really care that much about where you come from and I personally think that\u2019s a huge strength of the institute because they\u2019re less likely to overlook smart people who aren\u2019t as well heeled",

    "postText": "Hiya! I\u2019m a prefrosh and I\u2019m really excited to be coming to Caltech this fall! I\u2019m just curious: I think Caltech has had a college quizbowl team in the past, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s an ongoing thing right now. I don\u2019t recall seeing quizbowl at the club fair at PFE. \n\nIf it isn\u2019t, how difficult would it be for me to start one? Perhaps even as a frosh? I think there\u2019s been some interest from my fellow prefrosh - I\u2019m curious if current students are interested too. I just love trivia and it\u2019s something I\u2019d like to continue in college :)",

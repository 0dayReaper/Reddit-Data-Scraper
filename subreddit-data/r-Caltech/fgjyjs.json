I\u2019m new to Reddit but was lurking here for a while as an excited pre-frosh and ultimately decided to create an account because I saw that some people have really recommended FSRI, and the summer 2019 report listed quite a variety of fun research project focuses, so I just wanted to learn more details about the experiences anyone has had with it. \n\n-What was your experience like with FSRI? \n-Was there anything that surprised you about the program?\n-Did you have some research experience in high school beforehand and if so, how does it compare to that? \n-Did you find it helpful in setting you up for life as a Techer? \n\nI understand that only around 20 people participated in the summer 2019 one, so I apologize if I\u2019m looking for a needle in the haystack; any and all insights and wisdom would be much appreciated.  Thank you!",

Thank you, and I love your username! Alliteration is always so catchy, and that\u2019s really admirable wordplay on Wagner\u2019s piece...he\u2019s so awesome, and probably gives people a good *Ride* (I promise I won\u2019t play it unless it\u2019s 7 am finals week...no showers pls) ;)",

If you are driven and wish to continue research with the faculty member you are matched with, you may be able to do so.",

Truthfully, I didn't do a whole lot in terms research but learning how research and higher education works was a big thing I got out of FSRI. It definetly helped make connections and prep me for my SURF app/research for this summer. The math aspect also helped a lot in terms of getting comfortable with the material for Math 1ab and with proof based writing (FSRI math was also the most fun I've had with math at Caltech, imo).\n\nI think what surprised me most about the program was that I'm still very connected with my FSRI friends and the people (like mentors/faculty/admin) I met throughout the program. The program coordinators are AMAZING and the fact the the program is free is definitely a plus! As part of the program, you also get to go on some field trips (i.e. LACMA, Hollywood, Disneyland) which are a great way to explore the area, since that's not something I usually have a lot of time to do on the weekends due to workload. \n\ntldr: FSRI is cool and you should totally consider doing it! Feel free to ask any other questions about the program or Caltech in general :)",

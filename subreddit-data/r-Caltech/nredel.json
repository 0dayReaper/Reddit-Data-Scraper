Filling out my course selection preferences for the 2021-2022 academic year, and I was wondering if anyone here could let me know if the CS1 course fills up often/how difficult it is to get into CS1 as an incoming freshman even if it's listed as your first choice.\n\nAdditionally, if CS1 doesn't often fill/doesn't have a ceiling, I was wondering if it's common for other courses to fill at Caltech. Thanks, Beavers!",

CS1 is not typically limited seating, so unless something changes next year, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem getting in due to seating restrictions. \n\nSome other classes do have limited seating (especially humanities which commonly have a 15 or 18 student limit), but this is something you\u2019ll be able to look at more on REGIS when you register for classes for the first time by yourself (towards the end of first term).",

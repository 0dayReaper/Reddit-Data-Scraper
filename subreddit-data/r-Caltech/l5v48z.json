    "postText": "Hello! Does Caltech have any graduate programs that are masters or business or engineering specific?\n\nCurrently a working professional in tech for 10 years with an undergrad degree - interested in applying. However, the only programs I see that are somewhat similar were the provided PhD programs.\n\nIf anyone has any information that they can share, that would be great!\n\nThanks ahead!",

            "comment": "Caltech's graduate programs are almost exclusively research-focused (even the undergraduate ones aside from some second-major options designed for such in the humanities, for that matter), and so most departments will only consider grad applicants looking to do a Ph.D. program.\n\nA few grad students leave midway every year, and these folks will often receive a M.S. for their work to date, but there's really aren't any graduate-level curricula that are oriented toward continuing professional development for industry.",

The programs they offer are not degree-granting but you can pursue certificate programs in a number of tracks if that's of interest. You can check that out here: [https://ctme.caltech.edu/](https://ctme.caltech.edu/)",

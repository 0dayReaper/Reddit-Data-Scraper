            "comment": "It's more about taking the most advantage of the opportunities available. They will buff you up when you get there. Having had to TA calculus, and now teach diff eq with linear algebra, I can confidently say the AP Calculus test is mechanical horseshit, so I wouldn't worry about whether they took AB or BC. This is nothing to take away from their achievement, it's just that Caltech (correctly) has different standards than the AP board.\n\nI should say myself I got a 4 the first time I took BC, was admitted to Tech with that 4, and retook the AP exam to get a 5 my senior year just because I wanted to prove that I could. It had zero bearing on my performance in and passing of Math 1abc.",

Nothing spectacular about his ECs but he got excellent grades, test scores, compelling essays, and LORs. It is just that I asked this question at Quora and I was ridiculed right away and most of them said no :) I know it is a long shot but it is worth taking the plunge. At least we got an answer from you guys. Merry Christmas and thanks again for your time.",

Reddit has the same problem but as a little bit less so :) since there's room for moderation. A lot of answerers on Quora also enjoy talking about how \"brutal\" or \"genius\" things are. Don't take them too seriously.",

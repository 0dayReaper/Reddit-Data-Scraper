However, I know we've had design courses in the humanities before. The VC (visual culture) courses are probably the most design-oriented courses we offer, linked [here](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/courses/department/VC). You can also look up the Caltech catalog in general to see full listings of courses. \n\nAdditionally, we have some STEM introductory courses that don't require quite as much background, like CS1 (intro computer science) or some of the introductory labs, although I don't know how applicable that knowledge would be to design.",

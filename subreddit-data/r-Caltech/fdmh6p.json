    "postText": "Hi\nCaltech is my dream school and many of my friends want me to pull my application because I have a 1450 (710 English, 750 math). Pulling my application is crazy as there seems to be no upside.\n\nBe honest, have you seen anyone with SAT 1450? (My sat subjects are 800.800). Also,is the international student body really all Olympiad winners?\n\nSorry I do not know anyone from Caltech and couldn\u2019t visit to get a feel.",

            "comment": "Your SAT scores are competitive enough that they would not kneecap your application. Sure, there are a lot of people with 1600's at Caltech, but you still can have a solid chance. Do you really think Caltech rejects people because they missed some grammar questions?\n\nBest of luck with your applications! Applications in general are partially a coinflip. I got rejected from many \"weaker\" schools than Caltech, it's a lot about luck and don't be hard on yourself over rejections.",

I would say that the scores matter less than your extracurriculars and (perceived) strength of character. Good luck with your applications!",

I have a lot of experience in the field and an internship so I think I might have a shot at a research opportunity at Caltech, but don\u2019t know if any of the professors are even interested in having high schoolers around. Are certain professors going to be receptive to cold mails or anything like that? Sorry if this post breaks any rules lol just wanna know what research for high schoolers is like here",

You can definitely send some emails, but don't be surprised if you don't hear back. Profs are pretty busy, and I think we have maybe half a dozen tops working on QC. I think a lot of the high schoolers that somehow end up working here usually know someone and get in through mild nepotism unfortunately. Problem is though, a lot of the work that they might need in a quantum computing group is probably going to be well above your pay grade, so they might only be looking for qualified grad students, really good undergrads, or equivalent.",

I guess an equivalent kind of situation would be asking about how to get a job on Wall Street when you haven't done much other than managing your own finances and maybe a bit of research or small investing in the stock market. You'll need at least some formal training and education, or a parent who runs a hedge fund, to get that kind of a job. It's great that you've found something you're interested in, but you're targeting a really high level kind of job for the amount of experience and education you have. \n\nIn order to study quantum computing, you generally need a good amount of background in both physics and CS. You could probably find something more appropriate to your level if you expanded your search to the entirety of those two fields. \n\n&gt; had an internship in the field which even alot of postdocs don't have\n\nAlso, even if this part is true, it's probably not that relevant to quantum computing. A lot of the work going on is still extremely theoretical, so having \"internships\" (as used in the CS sense that I'm more familiar with) isn't nearly as relevant. I'd guess that the majority of the people working in the field have done significant projects in QC or written a paper or three.",

QC is probably one of the only extracurriculars im doing for fun atp and tryna do research there so i have \"\"\"higher chance\"\"\" or getting in. i can only imagine the pressure to do well is only heightened at a place like caltech tho, so idek. ty for the comment tho it means alot to me that someone out there cares lol",

            "comment": "To answer your question in short:\n\n\\&gt; Are certain professors going to be receptive to cold mails or anything like that?\n\nProbably not really, no.\n\nLonger answer: As nowis3000 said, \"a lot of experience in the field\" and \"high school\" don't really match up, and trying to present it as such would probably only hurt their impression of you.\n\nThere's also a pretty wide difference between (most) internships and (most) university research. Internships, especially for less experienced people, are often exploratory projects to \"build something and try it out and maybe we'll learn something along the way\". Sometimes the thing that comes out of it is very valuable, and those are the success stories you hear about; often the project ends and mostly disappears once the intern leaves. (Some internships focus on adding nice-to-haves to existing products, in which case the improvement will stick around after the intern leaves; but a manager would not assign a *necessary* feature or KPI to an intern.)\n\nUniversity research often\\* focuses less on \"building something\" and more on \"think about something\". Guiding someone to \"think about something\" as opposed to \"build something\" is often harder, and can be rougher for someone without the background. Professors at Caltech are also more (than some other universities) focused on foundational research.\n\n\\*At least within physics and theoretical computer science, where QC mostly is. This might less true in departments with more lab-driven work or more engineering focus.\n\n**So if you are qualified, how do you know, and how do you convince a prof?**\n\nThe best indicator would be understanding of current cutting-edge papers. I'll pick a quantum computing prof at Caltech mostly at random, excluding the experimentalists (which, based on briefly looking at your reddit, I'm guessing you're not so interested in). [Urmila Mahadev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urmila_Mahadev). [Here's her publication history](https://dblp.org/pid/140/7339.html), which is very heavy on theory CS and math. Another would be [Gil Refael](http://gilrefael.org/recent-publications/), who does stuff more on theoretical physics side. If you browse through their papers, and find one where you can understand 70% of it, then that's a great sign! You could email them and say that you want to work with them, and as evidence that you might actually be able to do something, you could state that you read \\[insert paper title\\] and mostly understood it. You could then ask if they have research questions related to that paper that might be suitable for a high schooler to take on.\n\nThis would be the exceptional case. Even a very bright high schooler, even ones who later go on to become a professor at MIT or something, will probably struggle to understand  these theoretical research papers. I know I sure couldn't! I think internships are great and will probably teach you more valuable skills at this point in time. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "as someone who did some quantum-related research internships (not at Caltech but another research university) in high school, will echo the other replies that it can be really difficult to do meaningful theoretical research at this stage. Even though I got a Regeneron STS Scholar distinction, I don't really look back on my high school research as a particularly meaningful contribution because these projects were mainly my mentor guiding me towards specific ideas to implement. Because they have less background, high schoolers are more difficult to mentor and take up more time than a grad student because the project needs to be more self contained while imparting a realistic view of the field, which is another reason why professors may be reluctant. A little cliche but as a younger student it is often hard to grasp just how much you haven't seen yet. \n\nThat being said, motivation does count for something and my high school mentors are a big part of why I'm still in the field now, so I would never discourage high schoolers from sending cold emails. Feel free to PM if you'd like to discuss how to go about this/background and preparation!",

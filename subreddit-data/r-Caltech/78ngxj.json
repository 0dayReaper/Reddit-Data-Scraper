Most faculty would be happy to have an undergrad involved (provided that your background is strong enough). \n\nThe [potential] issue is that few professors in the CMS department seem to be big on saying \"Here's a well-posed problem- run with it and let's meet next week to discuss.\"; it's much more \"What are you interested in? Okay, go read about that. Tell me what you find in a week.\"",

    "postText": "Good news everyone: I've got in contact with the Caltech bookstore and the people in charge of trademarks, and they are happy to consider new t-shirt designs.\n\nThat said, here is a link to 7 possible designs (shirt fronts only; I haven't drawn up any shirt backs): \n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/rcKQl\n\nThere are 3 other designs that I've hand-sketched but not yet mocked up in Illustrator (since they are more complicated).\n\nMy four main questions are below. I would HUGELY appreciate it if you answered even a single one. Moreover, please don't hesitate to post a reply; feedback from non-experts is especially helpful.\n\n(1) What do you like about these designs?\n\n(2) What color schemes do you think would work with any one of these designs? (I don't want to feel confined to orange and white, but I'm partially colorblind so I tend to not fuss over color.)\n\n(3) What design elements are you interested in that are not represented among the 7 designs at the link above? (Feel free to provide links to images that exhibit these design elements, particularly if they are t-shirts are from universities.)\n\n(4) What are some possibilities for back-of-shirt graphics? (Suggestions can be intended for a particular design from the given link, but they don't need to have a specific use in mind.)",

Someone suggested putting palm trees in the corner to give it more of a beach feel. At first I was just planning on making that change, but then I realized that the beach theme could be extended to remove the unintentional reference to imperial Japan. Check it out! http://imgur.com/a/61tqs\n\nI think you've got a point with design 5 and maybe a different shirt color. Even though I particularly like that shirt as orange and white, I think that the more space that a design takes up, the easier we can justify not using Caltech colors. I'll try to work with that principle to come up with some non orange-and-white shirts.\n\nFor design 8- yeah, I agree. There already is an orange shirt that just says \"Caltech\" though. I'll tinker with other possibilities and see what I can come up with.\n\nEnjoy your winter break!",

I think that if the colors were inverted then it would less resemble the Japanese WWII battle flag (which has a white background).\n\nI also wasn't quite satisfied with the design when I posted it. It had elements that I liked, but it didn't feel finished. Since you followed up I'll spend some time trying to tweak the design rather than toss it outright. \n\nUltimately it will be up to the student store manager to decide what they carry. Although, for heat-pressed designs it's super low cost to keep a wide range of possibilities in stock without putting much money down. I'll ask if the student store has a supplier who does heat pressed designs. If they do then I should be able to convince them to carry more \"niche\" designs.",

Very nerdy but that's what you're looking for in a caltech shirt.\n\n6 is too much like the old Japanese flag.\n\nI like the cannon element in 7.\n\nI like the plain #8 too.

I don't think I would personally wear a blaze orange shirt, but the basic design is fine.\n\nAn orange logo on a gray or navy shirt would be a good color combo for this design, I think\n\n3 The fonts look off to me in sizing and kerning, and the logo looks kinda funky in the C.  Also, I always internalized school as 'Tech' or 'Caltech' -- the 'California' in it never seemed important\n\n4 -- It doesn't have the 'off' look to it that 3 did, but ... I never thought of 'California' when i thought about school that much.\n\n5 -- I really like the design, but would prefer orange on gray for this, instead of on white.\n\n6 -- Ok, I guess.  Not quite to my style, but I can see other people liking it.\n\n7 -- I'm not a big fan of the whole Fleming cannon thing, so ... no.  Flems may disagree, and if you figured a way to make it red, or put 'FEIF' on the back, you might get some sales from them. (disclaimer:  I lived in Fleming for my first 5 quarters, back in the no-three-girls-in-a-row days.)  That aside, the wheel is too narrow to match the rest of the font, and the cannon was never kept at that angle.  The fonts of the 4 words are mismatched in style (italics) and size as well.\n\n8 looks nice, although I don't really like the slant on the top of the 't'.  (Is that the official school logo?  I really haven't looked in years and years.)  Again, I think this would look better in gray than white.\n\nAs a general note, I prefer gray shirts to white ones.  Some of these would also look good in navy or black.  I think that an orange logo might probably go better with black than navy, but ... I'm not a fashionista.  \n\nFor the backs, something like the word in 8 would be nice.\nAlternatively, the \"hand-holding-the-torch, with California Institute of Technology written in a circle around it\" icon could go on the back.  \n\nSome hoodies would also be nice, and the pullover type (vs. zip-up) would give a nice large area for logo design as well.\n\nOk, much nitpicking aside, thanks very much for your effort and enthusiasm in putting these together.  The offerings in the bookstore were ... frankly, disappointing.  I had hoped to pick up something for my older son (or myself) for the holidays, but didn't see anything that I thought he (or I) would actually wear.  :(",

                    "comment": "Thank you for taking the time to write a thorough reply!\n\nYour points for #3 and #4 are well-received; I wasn't conscious of the fact that people internalize the school more as \"Tech\" / \"Caltech\" than \"*California* Institute of Technology.\" I'll try to work \"Tech\" into the next round of designs.\n\nA general point on Caltech images: it seems that the campus recently did a sort of visual rebranding. The \"C-with-a-torch-inside\" it is actually the official \"Caltech icon\", the word \"Caltech\" with the cutoff \"t\" is the institute's *logo*, and the \"hand-holding-torch-.....-circle\" is now the institute's *seal.* None of the designs I've done so far involve the seal, since it is not available for download online (unlike the \"icon\" and the \"logo\"). I'll ask administration if I can use the seal for designs of polo or dress shirts though!\n\nAs for grey-vs-white, I'm becoming increasingly convinced that there are some good [read: dark] greys out there that maintain contrast with orange graphics. In my next round of designs I'll include those.\n\nFor #7, I have no sense of how undergrads view the cannon. The non-uniform typography (particularly italics) was meant to instill a sense of motion or energy in the design (it seemed boring otherwise). I will look into other (more industry-standard (?)) ways of accomplishing that.\n\nNot that it's pertinent to shirts, but what is meant by \"the no-three-girls-in-a-row days\"?\n\nAs for hoodies and the like, the selection is not as abysmal as that of the t-shirts (link here: http://www.bookstore.caltech.edu/Catalogs/CatalogProduct?CatId=102&amp;Title=Sweatshirts). In what ways would you like to see the selection improved? \n\nAs for the effort and enthusiasm, it's worth it as long as the student store is willing to make changes! If I encounter resistance I may need to print out reddit thread comments or enlist alumni to write emails-of-support ;)",

Fleming House had a rule in the dining hall where 3 women were not allowed to sit in a row, since ... were that to happen, one of them would not have a space next to her where a guy could sit.  At least, that's the reason the wait staff gave for the rule when i asked about it my freshman year.\n\nIt was an old rule, and there were a lot of other rules (no all-frosh tables, ...), all of which were enforced only at dinner, by a pitcher of ice water dumped by the waiters on the offenders.\n\nAdmissions tweaked some criteria, since the ratio dropped to ~3:1 for my junior/senior years, by which point I had moved into other Caltech housing, out of the 7 houses.  I didn't follow the evolution of the rules after I was finally able to move out of Fleming, but I heard that some of the more misogynistic traditions (3-girls-in-a-row, the post-rotation tour of the other houses singing the gangbang song, ...) ceased pretty rapidly after the ratio was adjusted.  \n\nOut of curiosity, are you a grad student, staff, faculty, ... ?",

Both of those were for 'extreme' cases.  \n\nI only saw those done when a couple of folks in Fleming decided (as a goof) to break all of the rules one night.  The headwaiter arranged for a 'grand tour' of all of the other houses.  The offending students were duct taped to chairs and taken from house to house to experience their worst.  The two rule-breakers got asked by each of the houses before they got the local maximum punishment.\n\nIt was all voluntary, though.  One person my year told the headwaiter that they did not have permission to float him, and he would not deliberately break any of the rules.  That worked out for everyone.  ",

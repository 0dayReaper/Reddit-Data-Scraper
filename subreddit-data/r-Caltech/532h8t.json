    "postText": "Hi there, \n\nCurrently working in environmental consulting, but I want to pursue getting a PhD after 5-8 years of working ( I'd like to get a PG license). I'd want to get a MS  to build research cred, would CSULA even tho not as high tiered school compared to other local UCs etc be a good choice with its NASA Direct program? \n\nMy end goal is to work at JPL in the surface hydrology group. \n\nUCSB BS Earth Sci -&gt; CSULA MS Enviro Hydro -&gt; Caltech PhD Enviro Eng/Sci -&gt; JPL is my end dream for this path\n\nThoughts? Would attending a different school give me a better chance? I was thinking of taking upper div pchem, math (ode/Pde), and physics (somethjng applicable) courses to strengthen my science-math toolbox",

            "comment": "Umm...are you me? I did this exact route. \n\nOne of the reasons I picked a CSU school for my MS after working for a few years was because I would be allowed to teach (not just be a TA) and could see how I liked that. Another is because if I decided I didn't want to continue my education I'd have an MS from a school that had that as its highest degree instead of getting a \"second prize\" of the MS from a UC school that also offered a Ph.D. I know that engineering is a bit different (I was in math) and MS degrees are thought of in a better light. \n\nAll graduate schools want students that will be successful. I think that having a proven work career and good recommendations from an MS program, even if it is a lower tier like CSULA, would make for a strong admission package.\n\nPM me your phone number if you'd like to talk more.\n\n",

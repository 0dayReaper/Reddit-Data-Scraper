    "postText": "So I am currently a physics undergrad looking into possible graduate schools I want to apply to. I really want to do some sort of aerospace propulsion research, and since Caltech is partnered with JPL, I think that it's a good option to look at. The problem is that while looking through the faculty list, I noticed there aren't really any professors who do propulsion research. Is this actually true, or are there ways to do research through JPL? Also, if there are any GALCIT PhD students on this subreddit, how is the program in general? Thanks for all the help in advance!",

Shepherd and Austin are looking at high speed flows and detonations experimentally and computationally. You might also look at the MCE department like Blanquart who does combustion processes. Also, in the first year program there\u2019s an awesome 3 course space propulsion sequence (Ae 121abc) taught by JPL faculty.",

Nominate the location, along with \"M\" or \"F\" (since the men's and women's rooms are almost never in the same spot), and tell me why it's a prime location.\n\nI'm gonna nominate the women's restroom (F) on the second floor of Guggenheim. It's in a remote unrenovated back hall, so lots of peace and quiet to do your business. It may be a little old, but it looks fancy with all the stone. Plus it has one of those antechambers for nursing women, so you can take a nap on the couch when you're done.",

During my senior year I made a webpage documenting all the weird, awkward and unique bathrooms in all the buildings but alas, it was lost when the hard drive it was on crashed.  Someone should go on a voyage of rediscovery and post it again.",

Just go to each floor and check out the bathroom.\n\nI did my little survey with my buddy and never once did anyone question two dudes going in and out of all these bathrooms with a camera.  Pedestrian by caltech standards, I guess.",

If this subreddit is so quiet that three links in three days is overwhelming it so much, then other people in the subreddit should contribute to it too.\n\nLet me break it down for you. The only way that most post docs find out about our volunteer office hours is said weekly email in the CPA calendar. The hours are very popular with post docs, we see about as many of them as other students at the Bike Lab. The only way undergrads see our office hours is the Caltech Master calendar bc there is no undergrad specific newsletter. The Bike Lab is trying to serve its community, so sorry if you find this spammy, many people like having the info and tell us so. The fliers on campus are very few, we don't plan to put up any more.\n\nOur bike shop languished for years because not many people even knew there was one on campus they could use. If you don't publicize resources, no one will know they exist. Our goal is to provide resources to the community, we are 100% volunteer, and if you have a problem with that we can take it to PM.",

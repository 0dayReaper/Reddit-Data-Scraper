            "comment": "I'm only a freshman, so I can really only answer the first two.\n\n(1) The intro CS classes (CS1 and CS2) are super reasonable (even for people who have never coded before). They move at an easily digestible pace (especially in comparison to a lot of the core classes), and they have plenty of office hours to help you debug your code or just ask conceptual questions. The CS1 projects all took me &lt;7 hours, and I never went to a single office hour. The class was an easy A even for a novice coder like me. However, the CS2 projects are a lot longer and harder, but office hours really help and a lot of the projects are partner projects. As long as you put in the effort, you can get an A in all the intro CS classes (although it really doesn't matter because you are on P/F for the first two terms).\n\n(2) Nah kids here do not try to one up each other for grades at all. We all help each other out and care a lot more about actually learning. No one ever asks you what you got on a set, quiz, or test. The workload here is undeniably a lot heavier than other top schools, but the take home tests and collaboration make up for it imo.\n\nBut if I were you, I would go to Vanderbilt for sure; it's an almost equally prestigious school for 1/7th of the price. For CS, it really doesn't matter which college you go to; your skills are what matter. Also, Caltech CS is super theoretical, which doesn't sound like what you are looking for. Although Caltech is undeniably amazing, you should not pass up a full tuition scholarship to Vanderbilt for it. Save your money; you can achieve your career goals at Vanderbilt while probably having the time to party more lol.",

            "comment": "Caltech CS here. Took an indefinite sabbatical in 2019 after finishing about 3/4 of the program. Here are my thoughts:\n\n**Academics**\n\n*How are the intro CS classes and teaching for a visual learner?*\n\nPretty good. Coming in, I had very little CS knowledge relative to my classmates, and the introductory classes made complete sense to me. They were well-paced, the concepts were well-explained, and the assignments seemed reasonable. The CS classes were some of the best classes I took at Caltech.\n\n*What was the initial learning curve compared to high school?*\n\nHuge - borderline incomparable. In high school I could get away with studying for 15 minutes a day and still get straight A's...at Caltech, sometimes I had to concentrate for hours just to understand a new idea introduced in class. But the knowledge gains were well worth the effort.\n\nTo be fair, the high school I went to was pretty \"soft.\" If you attended a STEM-focused high school that taught curriculum beyond the AP level, you might feel more at home.\n\n**Stress**\n\n*How big of a stress culture is Caltech?*\n\nDepends. There's a LOT of work, and it's generally not easy. I think most students spend about 40 to 60 hours a week on classes, homework, and studying. But the grading is fair (at least for the CS and finance courses I've taken) and there's virtually no competition between students. The atmosphere is almost exclusively collaborative. \n\nActually, if you try to one-up your classmates re: grades, you will be regarded as a tool and a douchebag. Don't be that guy.\n\n*For any bay area students that went to a high school like Gunn, Monta Vista etc. What are the culture differences at Caltech?*\n\nI grew up in the East Bay, but I attended a summer program with a couple students from Gunn, and they seemed like typical hard-working STEM nerds. I dunno, I think they would have fit in well at Caltech.\n\n**Diversity**\n\n*I have been at pretty undiverse schools most of my life. Think 95% white. I saw caltech is 60% male and 80% asian+white. Is this noticible on campus? Does it feel very homogeneous?*\n\nYes and yes. Racial diversity is one of Caltech's biggest weak points IMO. They're working on it, but they have a long way to go.\n\nNo strong opinion about the gender ratio. It didn't stand out to me when I was there, but this is coming from a somewhat-clueless cishet male.\n\n**Career Outlook**\n\n*I want to spend most of young years working on start ups, in a quant role, or at a Stripe, Uber type company. How is recruiting for places like Jane Street and other top firms? How is the start up culture and how much access do you have to blossoming companies at early stages?*\n\nI think recruiting by the kinds of companies you mentioned is great both for tech and for finance. My impression is going to a top company is pretty much the norm - I knew multiple self-described \"bottom of the pack\" students who received Google offers their senior year. Here is an abridged list of companies that recruit from Caltech, either at the career fair or via tech talks (or both):\n\n* Google\n* Facebook\n* Apple\n* Microsoft\n* Nvidia\n* Palantir\n* D.E. Shaw Research\n* Morgan Stanley\n* Goldman Sachs\n* Citadel\n* Jane Street\n* Two Sigma\n* TGS Management Company\n\nYou get the idea. That said, while I think going to Caltech will get you noticed by top companies, you still have to pass the technical interviews. I've seen good students have trouble getting offers because they didn't prepare sufficiently.\n\n**Graduate-School Outlook**\n\n*Can an average caltech student feed into top 5 CS PhD programs?*\n\nMost CS students I knew didn't apply to graduate school, but FWIW here are the graduate schools of the eight students I know of who majored in CS as undergraduates and entered Ph.D. programs also for CS:\n\n* 4x Carnegie Mellon\n* 1x MIT\n* 1x Stanford\n* 1x U. Mich.\n* 1x Cornell\n\nSo...yes? But there could be an effect of students applying to top-5 programs, not getting in, and going into industry instead of attending a \"lower ranked\" graduate school.\n\n*What is the law school potential for caltech?*\n\nNo idea...I knew like three students who went to law school. Two of them went to a top-5 law school and one of them went to a top-20 law school, but I don't think that tells you much about the general ease of getting into a good law school as a typical Caltech student.\n\n**Final**\n\n*If given the option, knowing my parents saved up 120k for college, would you go to Vanderbilt of Caltech (with my above goals and concerns)? Price difference I think Vanderbilt would be 11k (0 with parents money) for housing and food, Caltech would be 77k (47k with parents money)*\n\nEh, probably Vanderbilt. $77K is a lot of money and I don't think tech companies care that much about what school you went to. If you have a B.S. or a couple years' experience in the field, you can get an interview at a top tech company. Once you have the interview, nobody gives a crap about your on-paper credentials. And I'm sure you'd receive a great CS education at Vanderbilt.\n\nAre you really not receiving any money from Caltech, though? Caltech is quite generous with financial aid, even if your parents have a decent income. The financial-aid office is pretty friendly - I think it's worth reaching out to them and seeing if they can work with you on this one.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "im gonna agree with throwaway and gingy and add a couple things. \n\n1) i came into caltech with zero cs knowledge. took cs1 and 2, learned i hated cs (just personal preference), but the profs/classes are AMAZING (especially adam, the cs2 prof). half of the school majors in cs, so the department here is great. \n2) caltech is incredibly stressful. however, it\u2019s so unlike most of the other elite schools because the school puts so much emphasis on collaboration, and everyone really helps each other SO MUCH. i was astonished, and still feel almost unworthy of all the help i get from everyone. it\u2019s truly amazing. \n3) haven\u2019t been on campus yet (rip) but caltech places a big emphasis on diversity and i haven\u2019t really noticed the disparity online. yeah, as a woman in stem i\u2019ve gotten used to mansplaining but it\u2019s not a huge issue here? and like i said, the school\u2019s making an effort. \n4) i get emails almost daily from the career office about start-ups, and they host a lot of talks and recruiting here. \n5) i can\u2019t speak to CS specifically but i can say i know that PhD programs are almost guaranteed having gone to caltech (from what i\u2019ve heard), especially bc of the prestige of the school. \n\ni also can\u2019t help with the finaid portion. i had no money from parents and basically got a full ride from caltech. if money is an issue for you and you don\u2019t want debt, caltech might not be the best way to go with the aid you\u2019re offered right now (although there is later release dates for aid). overall, think about what you want and if any of the things i mentioned here seem appealing. also, take into considering the size and the house culture. caltech is very much a school for specific types of people, but if you\u2019re one of those people, you\u2019ll have a great, albeit stressful, time here. congrats on the acceptances, and best of luck in the future.",

You might have some monies!\n\nFor me, Caltech was 30% cheaper than UCs (I\u2019m in-state, so one would expect the UCs to be cheaper...). UCs normally cost around $30k to $35k a year. I ended up getting no aid from the UCs, but Caltech gave a ton!\n\nThe only other major school I had an acceptance at was USC, but I didn\u2019t bother checking what my aid would have been since Caltech was all that I wanted.",

It sounds like you have several big outcome-focused goals- prestigious trading firm, prestigious tech company, prestigious PhD program, prestigious law school... I would highly suggest reading the book \"Excellent Sheep\" by William Deresiewicz. I am a Caltech PhD student and did undergrad at an institution in the set {Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Columbia}. This book really helped me clarify my goals in life and how to align my actions with those goals.\n\nThat said, I mainly agree with /u/throwaway09304829.",

            "comment": "I graduated almost 20 years ago, so some things might have changed.\n\n1. I'm not sure how Caltech classes would be for a visual learner. I might have done better if I were more of a visual learner -- I have trouble thinking in three dimensions. For me, the learning curve at Caltech was very steep. I did not feel prepared for Caltech, and I had taken and gotten 5s in AP-level calculus and physics, among other AP subjects.\n\n2. Caltech was very stressful, but collaboration is encouraged. For the most part, Caltech students more likely to work together than one-up each other about grades. However, I knew some people who bragged about their grades and how much they were overloading and Caltech being too easy. \n\n3. When I was a student, only one third of the student population was female. The ratio is now closer to 50-50 among undergrads. Caltech is not majority white -- almost 50% of the undergrad population is Asian-American -- and there are international students, too, but many people don't consider this diverse in the typical sense.\n\n4. Top companies in both tech and finance recruit at Caltech. The startup scene at Caltech is not huge, but there is an entrepreneurship club. Some of my classmates, after graduating, went to work for Silicon Valley startups that became todays' big tech. Since they were early employees, they cashed out and are now VCs or founders themselves. My own career hasn't been that great.\n\n5. Some Caltech students go on to top PhD programs. However, one of the issues with Caltech is the relatively strict grading. Someone graduating from Caltech might have a lower GPA than someone comparable graduating from an easier but also prestigious school. I don't know how much graduate programs take difficulty into account.\n\nIt isn't uncommon for Caltech alumni to become patent attorneys. I know of someone who became a trial lawyer after working in engineering and argued in front of the Supreme Court.",

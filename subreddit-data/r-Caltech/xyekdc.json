Just be yourself and try your hardest and with enough luck you'll be a Caltech student.\n\nI know this isn't the answer you or anyone else want to hear, but that's the case. There is no formula to getting admitted to a top tier school and even then if you're hardworking and passionate you'll be successful no matter where you go.",

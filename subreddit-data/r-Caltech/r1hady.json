    "postText": "Hello, I've been thinking about applying for undergrad for fall 2022. I'm in high school right now and have an impressive transcript however I'm fairly unsure whether an undergrad degree from a prestigious university is worth it for such a steep price? Is there a significant applicable benefit to having a bachelor's from Caltech vs UCLA, Berkeley, or Cal Poly? The path I am interested in is a major in mechanical engineering with a minor in aerospace. Thank you in advance for any advice!",

            "comment": "Your listed public schools all turn out fantastic engineers. Caltech requires 4 years of tuition to graduate. The other schools allow early graduation and count AP credits, but you may take longer to graduate based on inability to get core classes.\n\nCaltech has a very steep price tag but also very good financial aid. Many of my classmates paid less for Tech than the equivalent public school.\n\nCaltech is a science school, not an engineering school. Regardless where you end up, you can make great connections and have no problems getting internships, jobs, and grad school.\n\nVisit. Apply. Make your decision based on that.",

            "comment": "I mean there's no harm in applying. But also consider that caltech is a bit of a bubble and not in a particularly good way. I went to a UC for undergrad and am now a grad student here and I personally feel like caltech feels a lot less like a university and more like a research institute. The undergraduate coursework will prepare you well but also seems quite hard and might leave less time for research / extracurriculars / the rest of life. And your fellow students will be cool people but less diverse especially in terms of background, class, perspectives, ideology, etc. There are also upsides to the elite private / small specialized stem school environment that caltech has, I'm sure. I mention all this because I don't think I was aware of it at 17-18 and it's an important factor in both your education and the beginning of your adulthood. \n\nBest wishes.",

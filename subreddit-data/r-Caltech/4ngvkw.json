Didn't care for energy so I'm working in the department of Planetary Science now. One project is paleoclimatology, studying the sedimentology of Florida's intercostal lakes to learn about past climates. The other project is for Deep Space Industries. We're creating artificial asteroid regolith to test out deep space mining technologies. I wanted to get more engineering related experience so I'm joining a lab that constructs cubesats as a platform for microgravity experiments. They regularly fly with Blue Origin and have had experiment on the ISS. ",

Good luck on your research you seem like a strong candidate for GALCIT. Personally I hate the word cubesat it's such a buzzword went to a cubesat seminar once at JPL in 2011 and 2012 and walked out having no idea what it is still. ",

I believe it is a category of small satellites fitting a certain dimension and mass but they're essentially just small satellites. \n\nThats pretty cool hearing about the JPL talk. Landing a career at JPL would be a dream come true, which is why I'm so heavily considering Caltech, because of the relationship between the two. \n\nThanks for the kind words, though! I appreciate the encouragement and will keep working towards that goal. ",

            "comment": "That's a really hard question to answer, because normally the best advice would be to ask about all the things you absolutely need in a house, followed by the fun stuff. You don't really know yourself yet, though, so that's hard to nail down. \n\nI'd just go with laid back and laughing at the process a little and friendly. See who's funny or whom you bond with and then ask them the harder facts about the house. Nobody cares if you ask a question they've heard before - it's not creativity hour. If you're having fun and they are, it's probably a reasonable fit.",

Another one I've found to be useful is \"What's something you think could be improved about your house\", since it doesn't have to be something bad about the house, and gives some insight into things that could be irritating.

It's still a question I think is interesting to ask to people because both how they answer it &amp; what their answer is tells you a lot about their personality. ANYWAY, you could ask upperclassmen what their \"ask-this-question-to-all-prefrosh\" question is. Even if they don't have one you might get a good answer / start a good conversation.",

Some of the less obvious questions you can ask are open ended or don't have answers in the traditional sense. \"What if $CRAZY_SCENARIO?\" is always good. Try and build a rapport with the upperclassmen you interact with and see if they are people you want to interact with more. Concrete details are much less useful than \"if I live with these people for a year, will I be sick of them.\"",

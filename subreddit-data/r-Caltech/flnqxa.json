    "postText": "Today, the County of Los Angeles and the City of Pasadena announced a \"Safer At Home\" order that prohibits public and private events or gatherings of 10 or more people, and requires the temporary closure of all nonessential business through April 19.\n\nAs Caltech complies with the order, the Institute will build on the actions that have been implemented over the past several weeks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on our campus and in our community. Please see the linked memo for specific actions for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, researchers, and all members of our community.

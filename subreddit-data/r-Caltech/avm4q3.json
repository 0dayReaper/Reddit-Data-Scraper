    "postText": "Looking at an application for undergraduate engineering/physics (quantum/nuclear) degree.\n\nIs it true that Caltech is very research/funding based (obsessed!?) an UNDERGRAD level?\n\nMy son is interested in attending - very lateral/design focused, not research so much. Loves the idea of being with hardcore and focused scientists like himself. Lots of brainstorming, ideas, trying things out ... he'd be in the stage before it gets to formal research.\n\nWould that approach fit at Caltech too?",

This is backed up by data -- about 35% of Caltech undergraduates receive PhD's, the most of any university in the world. The opportunities to do undergraduate research, which is key to getting into a good graduate program, are second to none. However, Caltech is sort of a \"scientist bootcamp\" and you probably shouldn't go there unless you are very sure that you want to pursue science as a profession.\n\nTech has downsides, too: the teaching quality is on average quite poor (although you learn most of the information from working with other smart people to do the problem sets), the workload seems higher than other comparable institutions, and name recognition outside academia is not as good as MIT/Stanford/etc. However, I think it was the best place for me and I'm glad I went there.",

In contrast, if you think he would prefer to be a free spirit and explore wild ideas with elite peers, then schools like Stanford or MIT might be a better choice.  ",

I ended up talking with friends who graduated a few years before me and everything worked out. This approach works particularly well for students applying to engineering jobs (Google, FB, Tesla, Boeing to name a few), where employers know the talent level of Caltech undergrads.\n\nEdit: feel free to PM me if you have more questions",

From what I remember, good grades on the SATs and SAT 2's (Math and at least one science) are table stakes. The AP tests can help too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom there extra curricular activities and research are what generally set people apart. Many students competed in math club and science activities like robotics. Some students had also worked in research labs, written papers, or done well in national science competitions.",

It's not remotely *required* for anything.\n\nAnd, funding? No, undergrads don't worry about funding at all. The whole thing that makes Caltech strong for research is that they basically have pre-allocated funding for undergrad research, which makes it easy/cheap for profs to take on undergrads to do work for them.\n\nIf you son likes personal projects, building weird ideas... then he will fit in very well at Caltech, for sure. :)",

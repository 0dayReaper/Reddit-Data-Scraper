    "postText": "Hi all, just confirmed to BBE program! I have moved around the US quite a bit but this will be my first time living in CA. I have only visited Pasadena once and know it is in the outskirts of LA but with access to some great outdoor opportunities. \n\nWhat are some favorite hiking and camping spots within a days drive? Where is the best location nearby to get connected with nature?\n\nIs there any community interest in water sports like sea kayaking or sailing? Those are both big where I am at and I would really enjoy getting on the water with others. \n\nHow are the Catalina apartments? I need to decide if I want student housing the first year and wish I had been able to tour in person. Do students generally enjoy living on campus or is it a means to and end? Wishing I could find a spot with a yard I could kick back in but it seems like that is a luxury possibly. \n\nAlso, anyone interested in going in on a rental house, message me and maybe we can make it happen! I heard there is a discord but haven't got the link yet.\n\nLook forward to seeing everyone in fall!",

My overall impression is that people are pretty outdoorsy and that the Catalinas are fairly nice and much cheaper than you'd get otherwise. Supposedly 90% + of new grad students live in Cats or caltech affiliated housing.",

Mountains overall are very accessible. I\u2019d be happy to give recommendations if you want but you might try r/socalhiking or check out some routes on AllTrails to get started. As far as water sports go, I\u2019m guessing there are people who do them and you might try reaching out to the surf club to get connected (they mostly do surfing/windsurfing but probably have some overlap with other water sports). Catalinas aren\u2019t great but for the price it\u2019s pretty nice (across from campus, Caltech wifi). I\u2019ve lived in them for a couple years. That being said, I know plenty of people who would rather live in a place with more amenities, etc so it\u2019s sort of just your preference",

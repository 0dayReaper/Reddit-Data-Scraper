    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nI am currently a Masters ME student at Georgia Tech and am thinking of applying for a PhD at Caltech in either Controls and Dynamical Systems or Computation and Neural Systems. I have been doing research since my undergraduate years but it has resulted in zero publications. I have a lot of research experience but somehow I never had the opportunity to publish a paper. I know chances of getting admitted is already low. But with no publications - should I even put in the effort to try at all?\n\nAppreciate your help!",

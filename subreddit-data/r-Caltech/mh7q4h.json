    "postText": "I am comparing programs and finding research at Caltech aligns well with my goals but am apprehensive about the human experience at Caltech. How happy are graduate students here? Are there strong cohorts that support one another? Does the administration support students? Does the small size limit the occurrence of friendships? Is the cost of living substantially higher than the stipend?\n\nLike I said, I am finding great research opportunities but I want to make sure the experience will foster growth.",

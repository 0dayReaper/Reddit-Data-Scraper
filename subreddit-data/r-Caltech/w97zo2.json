            "comment": "I am neither a CS or an IDS major so take this with a grain of salt:\n\nI just looked at the course offerings and it seems like IDS is more about Data Science. You'll be expected to learn programming but your focus is on analyzing and interpreting data and helping people/companies look at trends from data using software. So there might be some cross over with CS, where you will need to understand some theory in order to write efficient software. In terms of math you focus more on statistics and probability, linear algebra, and optimization theory, information theory, etc. There will be less emphasis on understanding low level engineering details like how memory allocation works. \n\nTraditional CS is focused more on how computers and software interact. In addition to learning how to program, you learn stuff like compilers, operating systems, algorithms, and how to write and design efficient software. You'll also be expected to understand hardware like how memory and processors work and how they interact with lower level software.\n\nBasically:\n\nCS: Understanding computers and software.\n\nIDS: Computers and software are tools for understanding data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that clears it up.",

I would not suggest a CS major. You will get end up learning too much gory details about operating systems, compilers, databases etc. A math or IDS major is probably better for you. However you will still need to learn how to program and write readable code as almost anyone who does quantum computing needs to know how to write simulations. \n\nBTW I'm not judging CS at all. These are very important things to know to become a competent software developer.",

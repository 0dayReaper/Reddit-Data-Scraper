It's not that the students aren't accepted into grad school at Tech, they just don't apply. Caltech encourages its undergrads to go to grad school elsewhere to get a more varied experience.",

What field of study is your son in?\n\nIf this is all toward deciding where he might apply, the best feedback your son can get is by asking his research and academic advisors.  They will be able to say whether it makes sense for him to apply to Caltech.  If they discourage him from applying, he should take that to heart, even if they dance around their reasons for saying so.\n\nIn general it really is a good idea to sample a new environment, though.",

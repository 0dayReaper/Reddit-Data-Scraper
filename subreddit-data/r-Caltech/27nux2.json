For grad students, it's nice at least until you get a feel for the area.\n\nIf you're not coming to pasadena for caltech, try x-posting to r/pasadena.\n\nFinally, [padmapper](http://www.padmapper.com) is a great apartment/room hunting resource for wherever you are. It compiles listings from a bunch of different sites. Good luck!",

            "comment": "In theory, you can get around without a car. In practice, it is really, really useful. When I started at Caltech I was the only grad student in my class with a car;  by the end of my 2nd year almost everyone had one, including the friend who was against cars for environmental reasons.\n\nTo give you some idea, here are some reasons/times I've used my car recently:\n\n* Getting to/from work. I usually bike, unless a) it's rainy, b) I have a presentation on a hot day (don't want to be sweaty in formal clothes), or c) I might be working late (while it's probably safe enough, I have encountered some street harrassment walking home late at night)\n\n* Buying stuff for lab - McMaster is expensive. it's nice to have the option to run to Home Depot\n\n* Going places to exercise - run at the Rose Bowl, hike, pop down to the beach for beach volleyball\n\n* hobbies - flying in El Monte, going to intramural softball games at JPL, driving out to Chino for an air show, volunteering in Monrovia\n\n* going out - concerts, bars, anywhere in heels. Could probably arrange my social life around a bike, but the car makes it safer and easier.\n\n* seeing friends - by now many of my fellow grad students have moved away from campus. There's no good public transit to Santa Monica, or Arcadia. \n\n* groceries - I normally walk, but need my car to get to SuperKing, Bhanu's, and just about any other ethnic grocery store\n\n* restaurants - there are SO MANY good restaurants in LA and Alhambra. Very few are reasonably accessible via public transit\n\n* life transitions - moving apartments, visting people in the hospital, getting to weddings, getting Ikea furniture\n\ntl;dr You can do without a car for the bare necessities of getting to/from work and groceries. You will sorely miss it for any kind of hobby, a social life, or an emergency.\n\nEdit - formatting. ",

            "comment": "Fair warning, transferring into Caltech is pretty difficult. We accept ~5 transfers a year, mostly through the 3/2 program. I think I\u2019ve also heard from admissions that most if not all of the accepted transfers probably would have been accepted if they had applied as freshmen. Being waitlisted here is a potentially good sign for that, but I couldn\u2019t tell you what your odds might be. \n\nThat being said, while Caltech is a special place, it\u2019s not the only place to get a fulfilling STEM education, and you might have a significantly better experience elsewhere. There\u2019s also a chance to apply here for grad school, assuming you\u2019re in a field where you\u2019d want a second degree, and if not (CS, engineering), other schools are more likely to have a better educational experience in that field.",

I didn't know that most were from the 3/2 program though, so thats a little disappointing\n\nNow, the uni im going to is great for my major, so the only other place I would rather be is caltech, which is why i'm so gung ho about this. Its the only way to improve my position from where I am now, and where I want to be if that makes sense. \n\nbut yea overall not too worried about not getting in, but man do I wanna get in",

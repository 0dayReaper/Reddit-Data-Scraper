            "comment": "BoC rep here! Your question really has two parts. To the first: yes, the BoC records convictions. That can be seen in [the bylaws](https://donut.caltech.edu/lib/ASCIT_Bylaws#articlexiiiboardofcontrol). XIII.5(d)(i) \"Past Convictions\" mentions it, but I'd specifically call out XIII.5(i) \"Confidentiality of Records\":\n&gt; Case records are maintained and accessed by the BoC Chair and Secretaries. The BoC chair may share relevant records the for the purpose of official business.\n\nThe second question, about whether the reasons are available to the institution the student is trying to transfer to, is definitely not something any student would really know. The deans/UASH handle that piece, and I'm sure it's exceptionally rare enough that nobody talks about it much.\n\nIf I had to speculate, I know my transcript specifies that I separated from the institute last year due to \"academic ineligibility\" (ie: didn't pass enough classes; long story, I'm back now and doing well). So perhaps they specify other reasons? But that's just idle gossip, really, I have no way of knowing.\n\nHope that was at least a little helpful!\n\n(Edit: I am only sharing this in the hope of indulging idle curiosity/hypotheticals. I really hope neither you nor anyone you know of is in this situation. In that case, I'd wholeheartedly endorse the other answer.)",

We sort of have to: we need details about prior cases to determine how to best protect the community in the context of each cases.\n\nBut this information is highly confidential. If you're \"curious about\" someone who you \"don't know ... personally\" and are just \"interested in what happened to them\" (as you mentioned in another reply on this post), then no, we will not reveal anything about a student's BoC interactions to you.\n\nI'm not exactly sure how transfer applications work, but I'd imagine they ask something like \"have you ever been sanctioned for academic misconduct, if so explain\" on the application, so the institution would know about what happened.\n\nYou can find other information about the BoC\u2019s processes on the ASCIT website: https://donut.caltech.edu/lib/BoC_Reps",

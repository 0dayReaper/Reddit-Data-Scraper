    "postText": "I'm currently an international student at Long Beach City College majoring in Mechanical Engineering and I was planning to transfer to Caltech. I'm curious how much weight is put into my secondary school report, considering I'm applying for my junior year at college. My current college GPA is 4.0 with honors program, 1560 on the SAT, 117 on the TOEFL, strong participation in engineering clubs, however, my secondary school GPA can't keep up with those scores. I graduated in Germany with a GPA of 2.8 and continued to work as a paramedic for 1 year, before moving to the US to pursue a degree in Engineering. What kind of impact will this have on my chance of admission?",

    "postText": "Hey, I was wondering how COVID would affect admissions for international students applying next year. I\u2019ve been in contact with the AO but they\u2019ve just said not to stress out (which makes me stress even more haha).\n\nHow much would olympiads be valued then since some competitions have been cancelled or having limited spaces so there is a chance I\u2019m not even allowed to participate. I hope you could look at my profile and recommend whether I should spend as much energy and time on adding ECs (I\u2019ll keep doing the ones I already am) or should I accept that I\u2019m probably not getting in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Demographics:**\n\nIndian\n\nSingaporean Citizen\n\nUsed to live in New Jersey (maybe if they ask why I want to go to the US?)\n\nNo financial aid\n\n\n**Grades:**\n\nStill only halfway through 11th grade, so nothing specific\n\nIB - HL: Physics, Chemistry, Math | SL: Spanish, Economics, Language and Literature\n\nExpected (not official but based on previous scores) - 43 or 44\n\nSAT - Took one paper without any prep on Khan Academy and got 750M and 720 RW\n\n\n**ECs:**\n\nOlympiads:-\n\n\\- SOF International Mathematics Olympiad 2017 (204th Place)\n    Note:-Not the International Mathematical Olympiad\n\n\\- National Science Olympiad 2017 (5th Place International Category)\n\n\\- UNSW 2016 English (Distinction)\n\n\\- UNSW 2016 Mathematics (Distinction)\n\n\\- American Mathematics Contest 8 (3rd Place)\n\n\\- International English Olympiad 2016 (9th Place)\n\n\\- National Cyber Olympiad 2016 (81st Place International Category)\n\n\\- UNSW 2015 Science (Distinction)\n\n\\- National Cyber Olympiad 2015 (11th Place International Category)\n\n\n\nPapers(none published yet, one of them is under review)-\n\n\\- The Use of Complex Vector Addition to Add Complex A.C. Voltages\n\n\\- Optical Computing and Its Feasibility As A Replacement For Classical Computing\n\n\\- A Derivation of Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle by Fourier Analysis of Sound Waves\n\n\\- Game Theory and Its Use in Predicting Strategic Interactions Amongst Self-Interested Agents Specifically in Electoral Processes\n\n\\- Prime Numbers and Number Theory and Their Extended Use in Cryptography\n\n\\- The Significance of the Cold War On Iran From 1945-1991\n\n\\- To What Extent Did the Meiji Restoration Lead To The Modernization Of Japan?\n\n\\- Does more data always help in the production of knowledge?\n\n\\- To What Extent Did Amin's improper rule contribute to the Soviet-Afghan War?\n\nI know they are pretty random lol. It's just me exploring possible interests.\n\n\nGoing for national olympiads and aim to qualify for the national team for physics and chemistry (not too sure about chem tho)\n\n\nStarted a tuition program for underprivileged children between ages 4-7 last year which was picked up and continued by an NGO and expanded even after I left\n\n\nGoing for AMC 12 and am hopeful because of grades from previous AMCs (although i missed AMC 10 as i was unwell)\n\nReally good Model UN awards - 1 first place, 2-second places, 2 third places, 1 fourth place and a Best Position Paper out of 7 total competitions while I specialize in the most competitive category, UNSC.\n\n*Awards listed are only those at national/international level MUNs\n\n\n\nResearch attachment at Institute of Microelectronics (cancelled due to COVID-19, big sad)\n\n\nMath Competition Team\n\n* all competitions have been cancelled or postponed so far\n\n\nScience Research Club\n\n* Director of Physics\n* In charge of tutoring younger students to eventually be in the Advanced Science Program at my school\n* In charge of tutoring students for Olympiads like Singapore Physics Olympiad and IPhO\n* Organizing IDEX 2021, an acclaimed and competitive international engineering competition\n\n\n\nYoung Innovators Society\n\n* Training Mentor\n* (joined this year so I haven\u2019t done much yet)\n\nYoung Diplomats Society\n\n* Training Mentor\n* Chair for International Model United Nations Conference\n* Highest awards in my year\n\nAstronomy Club\n*Participating in competitions like Astronomy Olympiad and if I luck out I may qualify for IOAA but I\u2019m not too sure\n\nSeveral online courses from universities like Caltech and Stanford (certification is given)\n\n* Particle Physics: An Introduction (University of Geneva)\n* The Evolving Universe (Caltech)\n* Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity (Stanford University)\n* Science of the Solar System (Caltech) - not finished yet\n\n\nIntended major:\n\nPhysics / Math double major or with math as a minor\n\n\nHigh School:\n\nSuper competitive high school with an 8% acceptance rate with students from other countries mostly in Asia coming to study here\n\nHigh school is the highest ranked for IB in the world with getting nearly 50% of the worlds top scores and highest average in the world\n\nServing 2 years in national service (Armed Forces)\n\nSafeties:\n\n-National University of Singapore\n-Nanyang Technological University\n\nThey are not bad universities and while I would prefer US, I am ok with them if I don\u2019t have a chance.",

My extracurriculars weren't even 10% of yours and I went to a mediocre US public high school yet I got in. I think Caltech tries to take into account the opportunities available to you. I'm from a small, isolated town so there weren't many chances for research or national competitions, which it seems like you have a lot of access to.",

There\u2019s a ton of stuff for bio or humanities though. Most of the olympiads I\u2019ve signed up for myself and studied myself without any external help.\n\nThanks anyway :)",

As a current undergrad who also competed in the olympiads in high school, I had never heard of the SOF IMO. Naming the SOF IMO might make you seem somewhat desperate to \"fit in\" with the people who went to the IMO (who are also applying), since the SOF IMO has a similar name but seems to be much easier in contents. Fortunately, your other ECs are good enough on their own and you don't need the SOF IMO at all: you can get those \"smart credits\" via the other ECs ;-)",

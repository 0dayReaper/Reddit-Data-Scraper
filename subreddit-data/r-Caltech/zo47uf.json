    "postText": "Hi! I'll probably be attending Caltech next year as a post-doc. My parents live in Berkeley and I was wondering what's the best commuting option between the two cities for a guy without a car. I've had horrible experiences with California buses but there really doesn't seem to be any better option. \n\nI'll do the commute on average once per month, give or take, and my primary priority is cost (really broke).\n\nBack when I was in Boston I had a pretty similiar situation between Boston and NYC and what ended up happening was  that a bunch of people who have the same commute would carpool to save $, does anyone know of anything similiar in Pasadena?\n\nAny tips or advice?",

There's unfortunately a starting bus leg but they're the nicest bus option I found and it's possible to actually do some work/stretch on the train leg at least. Usually cheaper than flights too unless you're able to plan way ahead (and environmentally better). Not the fastest, but a good option to keep in mind.",

I think that Lake Station (340 N Lake Ave) is a reasonable walk of 1mi from campus.\n\nBut yeah +1 on the train. Metro from campus to union station, then train up the coast. A bit slow but pretty affordable and low-stress.",

The starting bus leg is because there's not really rail between LA and Bakersfield and for a bit that was the route Amtrak was running most frequently. Now that you mention it, the coast starlight should be back now though so it may be better than I was putting up with ~last year!",

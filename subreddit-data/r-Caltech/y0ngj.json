I'm fairly confident in my academic record and current standing, as I am attending an Ivy League school. \n\n\"Currently attending an Ivy League school?\" *Wow, that guy sounds like a total douchebag.* This is among my chief reasons for transferring; I've become massively disillusioned with my current institution's concern for prestige and reputation (as opposed to education and outreach). Also, if I have to take one more class with an entitled WASP who wants to lecture me on the values of small government and fiscal responsibility, I might finally snap. \n\nIn short, I'm looking for any fellow Redditors who have transferred to Caltech from another institution (or who know of someone that has) who would be willing to offer some insight on the process.",

These include tiny student body (arguable as good or bad), not the greatest lectures, and some healthy social ineptitude.\nIf you're really considering this you should check out quora.com and look at the Caltech board.\nIt's significantly more active than this one and you will likely get around 5 well thought out responses.\nBest of luck.",

            "comment": "I think the biggest thing is the credit transfer. It's best in a transfer's case to simply study up and take the placement tests (the one's to place out of, not the ones to place in, of course) for the core classes (Ma1abc, Ch1ab, Ph1abc), that'll get you out of a lot of classes that'll otherwise clog your already busy schedule (you'll still need to make up for the humanity requirements and the freshman lab requirements). And if you're feeling extra ambitious or are miles ahead, you can opt to take the tests for Sophomore year core (Ma2ab, Ph2ab) If you snoop around, I'm pretty sure they have past years' tests somewhere on the internet. (The CS1 exam is also nice to place out of).\n\nBut as for the social thing, intellectual performance and perceived smartness plays a pseudo-similar role to prestige in Ivys (Ivies?). Although somewhat annoying at times, I'm sure on the whole it's a lot better.\nSam (friend who transfered) generally remarked that the society was similar to the clique-y, intellectually charged, and slightly judgmental environment of his high school (Thomas Jefferson High School, TJHS) but to a lesser degree. He welcomed the school as a great positive change over his last college, Williams and Mary.\n\nEven if the GPA/Essays/SAT is not an issue, just be sure that you try to get a good understanding of what Caltech rigor is like, because that is exactly what defines our undergrad. There have been a few people who've gotten in the school but later transfered due to the coursework being too hard or something along those lines. \n\nAs for small government and fiscal responsibility...\nWe have our share of republicans, but most people don't really pay much attention. Of course, every now and then Overlord (Dean) Kiewiet of Caltechia will make some interesting propositions in Political Science classes, but most people save the opinions and just dish out the science.\n\nGood luck and feel free to ask anything.\nPage '15",

Caltech is more conservative than most universities, and has its fair share of entitled WASPs.  I don't imagine it's worse than an Ivy League university, but nor is it a utopia.\n\n(Not a transfer, I'm Dabney '14.)",

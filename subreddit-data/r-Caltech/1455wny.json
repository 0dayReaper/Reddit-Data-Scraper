    "postText": "Hii, I'm a Brazilian student who wants to study at Caltech majoring CS, and I want to know how is to be an undergraduate at Caltech. I'm very interest to know about the relationship with the professors, are they really interest in your development? are they friendly? are they accessible (to ask questions, or to talk)?\n\nAlso, I want to know about the CS curriculum, is it really worthy? I'm in a point where I don't know if it's really worthy major in CS, since I could learn all of it at home (at least is what I think). However, I think that my main reason to join an University is because of the people there. Is the Caltech community really worthy joining in? What are the best things about the community?\n\nSorry for the long text, but I would be very happy to read about your experiences at Caltech, since it's my dream university (I loved the core curriculum idea).",

    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI got an offer from Cambridge and recently got admitted to Caltech, and, while I am extremely happy about this outcome, this has got me in a bit of a dilemma. I would be very thankful for any input/experiences/opinions you might have, even if just about your feelings about US v. UK :)\n\nI am an EU student, thinking of studying EE, currently leaning towards Caltech quite a bit!\n\n**Caltech**:\n\nPros:\n\n* More financial aid, so would be cheaper (nearly no debt after graduation)\n* Many undergraduate research opportunities at places like NASA JPL, LIGO\n* Unconditional offer\n* Weather is much nicer\n* Much smaller (could also be a con)\n* Professors are very approachable\n* Ability to take a minor in another subject\n\nCons:\n\n* Very far away from home\n* Located in suburbs, not a very \"student city\" feeling (I have not been on campus, though)\n* Not such a diverse atmosphere (few international students, generally STEM majors)\n* Not such a wide range of clubs\n\n**Cambridge**:\n\nPros:\n\n* Much closer to home (geographically and culturally)\n* 4 years for a masters degree\n* Very diverse atmosphere (a lot of international students, STEM among humanities, etc. majors)\n* Cambridge is an amazing city\n* Wide range of clubs\n* Supervisions\n\nCons:\n\n* Conditional offer (won't know if I got admitted for 100% until August)\n* More expensive\n* Not as much freedom in choosing what classes to take/switching majors, taking a minor\n* Not as many opportunities for undergraduate research\n\nStay at home :)",

            "comment": "Having spent a term studying at Cambridge, I can offer what anecdotal advice I have... \n\nCambridge is a much more vibrant place to be than Pasadena. There is a lot more going on in the town and more is accessible to you given that the drinking age is not 21 as it is in the US. Cambridge is much less isolated from its surroundings, as the whole university is woven through the town. There is more intellectual diversity, tons of societies and activities to join, etc. The amount of history is incredible, the architecture is inspiring, just a very vibrant and cool place. If you are into partying, you will probably spend time going out to the night clubs on bizarre days of the week to avoid the local townie crowd. \n\nAcademically, I can speak in terms of the CS classes only. I would say Caltech courses involve a lot more challenging problem solving and little memorization. Exams are long and open note/book. The real challenge lies in the unending supply of brutally difficult problems and you will need to work with others to get through it. Cambridge has a whack system that has been used for centuries where they take all their exams at the end of the year and get no other assessment in their classes, with some exception for practical 'lab' type classes. I think this system causes people to goof off for the first two terms and then grind a bunch the last term to memorize everything. The problems were certainly not as challenging, but more focused on drilling concepts into your head to prepare for the exams. I think the Caltech system of education is better but more challenging, at least as far as CS classes go. \n\nI think culturally it will be a big shift to go to Caltech, and this is not something to be understated. If you feel like you can be comfortable around anyone and won't mind the cultural shift then you can certainly make friends at Caltech. If you find a house you vibe with, you'll fit in great. It is a very small, focused community and if you find your people to fit in I think you will have a good time. \n\nPersonally, I am glad to have gone to Caltech and don't think I would be as happy as a full student at Cambridge. Culturally, Caltech has been a better fit with its small focused community. Most time is spent solving problems with friends or goofing off and enjoying the relative freedom in the houses. I prefer this to spending time doing arranged club activities and memorizing stuff for once a year exams. It will come down to your personal preferences. Let me know if there's anything more I can answer.",

            "comment": "Congrats on your offers! I'm writing based on my experience as an undergrad in Oxford and PhD student at Caltech. I won't write a long post, since I think your pros and cons as well as warwikimaster's comments are spot-on. I'll just add my personal experiences with a few of the points made.\n\n* I personally preferred the environment at Oxford (which is similar to Cambridge). I definitely missed the academic diversity of students and the college town feel when I came to Caltech. The environment at Caltech is very focused on STEM, and the houses are very tight-knit (and from the perspective of a grad student, somewhat odd). The Caltech atmosphere is a lot of fun, but I think Cambridge leads to better social/personal development due to the wider variety of people and experiences. However, even though the environments are so different and I do have a preference for Cambridge, I don't think you can go too wrong here.\n* I think the flexibility in classes and majors at Caltech is very important, especially if you are not completely sure what you want to do or if you are interested in an interdisciplinary area. \n* An undergrad at Caltech could correct me here, but my impression is that the workload at Caltech can be extreme at times. Cambridge certainly wouldn't be easy, but I think it would be more academically relaxed than Caltech. Personally, I find the Cambridge workload healthier.\n* In addition to undergraduate research being easier to come by at Caltech, it feels a lot easier to do corporate internships. I've spoken to some undergrads at Caltech, especially in EE/CS, who had worked on some really cool projects while doing an internship. I didn't know many people who had done an internship while at Oxford, and I think that is to the detriment of the university. Even aside from the career benefits of an internship.\n* Depending on what you want to do after you graduate, the master's you get from Cambridge may or may not be useful. A bachelor's from Caltech would be enough for any US PhD program. I'm not as sure about industry jobs, but my impression is that most tech companies will be happy to take people with a US bachelor's alone. The biggest difference would come when applying to UK/EU PhD programs which tend to require a Master's. However, I think PhD programs in the US are better than those in the UK/EU, so for me, the Master's isn't a huge factor. \n\nGood luck with decision, and even though it is a tough one, keep in mind that they are both great schools and you can't go wrong either way. Feel free to follow-up with any more questions",

            "comment": "Both are excellent colleges,and congrats on getting into them!\n\nI'll put it simply: if you want a more broad but still rigourous and indepth education in the sciences(especially in physics,math, and chem) go to Caltech. There core curriculum will teach you a ton. You will have more opportunities for research, and more opportunities to switch out of your major if you do not like it. The location is unbeatable, and is close to places like LA and silicon valley. Not many people know about Caltech, but it's extremely well respected by those who do know about the school.\n\nIf you want to dive right into your subject, go to Cambridge. They have an amazing supervision system, in which you can have discussions about your subject with some of the top people in your field. I suppose the supervisions system is one of the biggest advantages of Cambridge. Alongisde that, you will get to experience quirky ancient Cambridge traditions such as formals and may balls. You will get to live in old ass rooms(if u are lucky!) and eat your meals in old dining halls. Plus I've heard it's deeply humbling to know that so many great minds have walked through those old hallways at Cambridge.\n\nOut of curiosity, what college did u get accepted to in Cambridge? \n \nOne more thing. If you are curious about Cambridge life, go check out a YouTuber named Jake wright. He studied CS and graduated in 2015. It might be a little outdated, but it's still pretty good.",

Gotta love the free laundry there lol. \n\nSo I know it's past may 1. Did u choose Caltech or Cambridge? It doesn't really matter, both schools are absolutely terrific and since you have proven yourself smart enough to get into these schools, you should be fine wherever u go!\n\nAll the best!",

When you are capable to get into caltech, you will find more like minded ppl there. And you can specialize in various branches in EE and Caltech has good professors and who knows, you might get to do a phD as well. You will have fun wherever you are IF YOU wanna have fun so don't worry about that. Once you find your set of peeps it will be all amazing. Cheers and good luck mate :)",

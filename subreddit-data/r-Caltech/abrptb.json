    "postText": "I'm doing well with a GPA of 4.0 and have taken up to ODE and 3 classes of college-level physics.  So far I'm pretty confident that I have a very steady knowledge in Math and Physics.\n\nI don't have many extracurricula activities. I'm a member of the Greek society and do occasional volunteer stuff, but not that much of an outstanding \"activist\".\n\nI'm having quite a good connection with the STEM faculties in my current school so I may be able to ask them for a good letter of recommendation.\n\nFrom what I heard, there's only about 8 transfer students accepted each year. Will I stand any chances of getting in Caltech? I'm a Physics major btw.",

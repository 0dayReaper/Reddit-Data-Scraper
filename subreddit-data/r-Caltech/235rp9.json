Let me know if that didn't work. This should be more sustainable than my having to set one for everyone who wants one.\n* As of tomorrow, April 16, the mods hereby request that all regular events only have one post in the sub at the time and that you remove your post after the event is over. This is to prevent very regular events from taking over the front page.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask away.\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a student at a large public university nearby (you can probably guess which one), and I'm interested in doing a SURF. \n\nMy PI has strong ties w/ potential PIs at Tech, and I've already emailed them and scheduled meetings to talk about potential projects. I'm pretty hopeful that these talks will go well, because I've already met these folks before at a previous conference, and they seemed pretty chill. However, I have a lower GPA (3.06), which is above average for engineering at my school, but I don't know how the SURF committee will perceive it. How much is GPA considered in the SURF approval process?",

If you can get one of their buddies at your school to write a POSITIVE letter, you should be in a good position. \n\nWhat program, out of curiosity?",

Not sure if it's necessary but if you really want to increase your chances, reach out to the desired Caltech Prof and ask about meeting them briefly and having a lab tour, since you're so close it'd be easy for you to drive over. \n\nLikely they'll have a grad student give you the tour and maybe just see you in passing, but it'll at least show your enthusiasm for their research area.",

Also, if the House you wanted didn't take you...well, there may be reasons for that. I don't know any details of your situation, but waiting a term may help some of the froshiness wear off.",

Keep in mind that some houses have more difficult procedures than others.\n\nYou may want to apply for a social membership first in some houses. Overall, I suggest as they do below, to get acquainted with the house you rotated into first, before committing to other places. Its understandable that your rotation friends may have gotten into different houses than you, but overall you will make new friends.",

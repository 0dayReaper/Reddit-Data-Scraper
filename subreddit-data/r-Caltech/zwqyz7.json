I'm applying through CommonApp, and want to submit an external porfolio (research paper, projects, etc.)\n\nHere is the passage from the admissions question:\n\nCaltech allows for the submission of an external portfolio, such as a maker portfolio, a research project, or other creative endeavors. After submitting an application, you will receive access to the Caltech Application Portal (Beaver Breakroom) where you can upload your external portfolio for admissions consideration.Do you plan to submit an external portfolio to Caltech? If you select \"yes\" or \"unsure,\" we will email you more information on how to submit your portfolio after the admissions deadline.\\*\n\nI answered yes, and there is a link directing me [here](https://apply.caltech.edu/portal/portfolio-instructions). To submit anything, it looked like an account was necessary, so I created one. However, I am still unable to submit anything (error message: `Select an applicant to submit this application-scoped form.`), nor can I start a new application in the App Management section (`There are no application types currently available`).\n\nBased on this it seems like it will be an external link provided afterwards? I just want to know the timeframe for long \"afterwards\" is, I might be going on a trip and would really hate to miss it",

The due date should be posted inside of the portal, but I don\u2019t remember, honestly. If it isn\u2019t posted there, I\u2019d email admissions and ask to know the due date. I submitted an item and I don\u2019t recall ever feeling like I was pressed for time, so it\u2019s likely due when applications are due or 1-2 weeks after when all items (LORs/transcripts) are due",

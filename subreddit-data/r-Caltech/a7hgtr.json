    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm an early admit to Caltech and I would like several questions answered before I finalize my decisions on May 1st.\n\n1. Do you ever felt hampered by the small class size, or empowered by it? If possible, please enlighten me on the housing system and its intricacies not covered on the website.\n2. How much free time, including the weekends, do you have in total?\n3. How are the GPAs at Caltech?\n4. How are the clubs and activities at Caltech? Do you have at least enough time outside of studying to participate in them?\n5. Is core as bad as they make it out to be, or has it gotten better in recent years?\n6. What kind of options do you have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? By no means do I mean just inside the houses, I'm asking if there are local and chain restaurants worth going to. (even LA is fine)\n7. About Pass/Fail. I read that the first two terms are P/F, so does that mean something like Fall and Winter term in Freshman year? What are your options for P/F after those two terms?\n8. What are some relatively fun electives that you took?\n9. What are your travel options if you don't have a car?\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer my questions!",

            "comment": "1. The small class size has been excellent for me. You get to know people a lot better this way, and everyone (including upperclassmen, TAs, and profs) are very accessible for help and advice. There\u2019s a lot to the house system, but in the event that you come here to visit (either for the Prefrosh Weekend or for Caltech in a Day), people will be able to tell you lots about it. Suffice to say, it\u2019s a unique experience. \n\n2. I personally have a fairly healthy amount of free time, but I\u2019ve only gone through first term frosh year. The upperclassmen I\u2019ve interacted with also seem to have a good chunk, but I probably only see them when they\u2019re free. People work hard and work a lot of the time, but it\u2019s completely manageable. As to when my free time falls, it usually depends on how much work I did during the week. You can make time for things relatively easily. \n\n3. Not 100% sure, I think you can find statistics online. Caltech classes are hard, and med/law school straight out of Caltech is harder due to the difficulty of pulling near-perfect GPAs. A 3.0 (from what I\u2019ve heard) is quite reasonable, and getting up closer to 4 is achieveable but difficult. Again, no personal frame of reference as a first term frosh. \n\n4. I haven\u2019t gotten super involved in clubs, mostly just Band and the ARC so far, but there\u2019s all kinds of clubs and activities available. There\u2019s a big club fair right near the start of the year which directs people to what they\u2019re interested in. You can make time for clubs, but you can\u2019t do everything. \n\n5. For me, core has been pretty reasonable so far. High school knowledge does play a decently sized role in how bad core is, but there\u2019s nothing completely unreasonable about it at all. Since you\u2019re the type of student to get into Caltech, I\u2019m sure you enjoy intellectually stimulating classes, which I can confirm that all of my classes this term were like that. \n\n6. Depending on your sleep schedule, house kitchens and chandler are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and while the food is okay, there\u2019s a huge number of restaurants that are easily walkable from campus. Lake Street (the big street half a mile west of campus) has several dozen restaurants all under a mile from campus, and by Uber, you can get to Old Pasadena and South Pasadena pretty easily. Delivery also exists, as well as Chouse on school nights (delicious fried or grilled food in Chandler from 10pm-2am) \n\n7. You\u2019ve got the P/F right for the first two terms, and past that, I believe you can take up to 96 more units of P/F classes that aren\u2019t part of your major requirements. There are some exceptions like Ch3a/x, which is P/F for your first two years, but they\u2019re rarer. \n\n8. I took CS1 and Intro to Film for my electives, both of which were really interesting. I also heard good things about the Frosh seminars which you can choose as electives when you choose your first term classes. \n\n9. Uber/Lyft are pretty easy, lots of people have bikes, and I personally have gone to downtown LA, out to near LAX, and to the Claremont colleges using public transportation (trains and busses), all of which were pretty reasonable trips. Getting to a bus or train stop is a little trickier, but if you don\u2019t mind a short walk or 5 minute Uber on either end of your train/bus trip, it\u2019s very easy to get anywhere in and around LA. \n\nHope this helps! Feel free to ask any other questions you might have. ",

Does that extend throughout the 4 years of undergraduate experience?\n2. What are the p-sets like? How often do you get them, what's their difficulty and how many questions there are? And what kind of classes give them out?\n3. How many classes are you planning to take per term? And of those how many are core, major requirements, and electives?\n4. What's your prospective major?\n5. Do you think that in the career and graduate world, the Caltech name can explain a non-near perfect GPA?\n6. I read that Caltech is a slap in the face for many people, how much of that notion do you think has applied to you?",

                            "comment": "1. Pretty consistent in all four years, with a few exceptions for lab-based courses (final project in lab, although freedom of when to do it), and some chem courses that are just straight up memorization (not sure which, they\u2019re upper lever orgo I think)\n\n2. My first term sets have been about what I expected going in. They\u2019re mostly interesting problems, with very little busy work (some exceptions to chem with drawing resonance structures and molecular orbitals, although the problems are still interesting, just more writing than some other classes). For almost all classes, it\u2019s 1 set a week, typically 5ish questions in core so far (CS is a little different, similar amount of time spent, more variety in question length). Almost all non-lab based STEM courses will have sets, hums have more variety (usually essays due every 1-3 weeks and assigned readings). \n\n3. The most common approach is to take 5 full classes, you can overload up to 6 or under load to 4, but it depends a lot on which classes. Classes are typically 9 units (45ish units/term to graduate) with some being 6 (Chem1a for example) and some being 12 (ACM95 I believe). You can also add smaller 1-3 unit pizza courses (weekly lectures with free pizza at lunch, possible light reading), 3 unit physical education classes, or other low-unit classes to fill in your time. In my first 15 courses (planned out for all of freshman year), I\u2019m taking 4 major requirements (CS 1, 2, 21, 24), 9 Core classes (3 phys, 3 math, 2 chem, 1 chem lab), and 2 frosh hums (required before you take other humanities courses). \n\n4. CS or possibly the new data science major. \n\n5. Yes, although non-near-perfect is kind of nebulous. Caltech name with a 2.0 probably won\u2019t get you there, but with &gt;3.0 (for career) or &gt;3.5ish (for graduate) should make up for it. \n\n6. For me, it wasn\u2019t really a slap. My high school prepared me pretty well for Core, so those three subjects were all fine. Many students around me, however, hadn\u2019t seen all three subjects at the level Caltech starts you at, and from interacting with them, it did feel a bit like a slap. The living on your own in college is a pretty big change for most everyone too, but having done summer camps and such at colleges, I was able to adapt pretty easily. All of this isn\u2019t to say that it was easy. I\u2019d equate my experience more with driving on your own for the first time in a fast, unfamiliar car. The excitement is all there, but it\u2019s still scary knowing that you could mess up somewhere along the way, but the sensation is less of a slap and more of being on edge in a new, potentially dangerous situation. Mind you, Caltech isn\u2019t physically dangerous or anything, but it\u2019s more excitement mixed with concern at something new in your life. ",

            "comment": "1) I personally really like it. This plus the houses strongly encouraging cross-class interaction makes me feel as though a lot of people I end up running into are people I know, which is really nice. That being said, there are still \\~1000 people here, so it's not as though it's impossible to find a different group of people to hang out with if you don't fit with some people you know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe house system is Hogwarts, to steal the way-too-overused explanation. You rotate into one of 8 houses with distinct personalities, and are a member of that house (unless you choose to drop membership). You can join other houses later, and cross-house interaction isn't too hard, but the houses give you a foundation of frosh and upperclassmen who hopefully share common interests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2)  Less than I normally would, but if I were to spend all afternoon productively doing my work I would probably have the entire night free, and a good chunk of the weekend. I've definitely found I still have the time for social activities and clubs, though ymmv and it depends on if you're taking a particularly heavy courseload. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) You're not going to have a 4.0 without trying, but 3.0 is reasonable I've heard (I've only been on grades for 2 terms). People know that Caltech does this, so for many jobs and such GPA requirements will be a bit lower, and grad schools I've heard are aware of this as well. My current GPA is a 3.3 (from just 1 term), but I took a lot of classes that term that tend to help the GPA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) I mostly do theater (which varies in time commitment from \\~1week/year to every night for a term), and I've had plenty of time to do so. There are plenty of clubs and a club fair every year which is pretty populated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) You're on P/F for most of it, and it's all doable. The worst thing to me was just that I can't stand physics, so 3 terms of it was not super fun. I think it's a pretty valuable thing to have, though, and not too bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) Breakfast is either at Chandler (uses board funds) or open kitchen - the kitchen is left open and you can take various foods (generally not hot breakfast) until \\~11am. Lunch is Chandler, which is edible but gets dull. Dinner Chandler is open (with the same food as lunch) or the houses will have a sit-down dinner with (generally) student waiters. There are also lots of options both nearby and further into LA to explore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7) Yes. After those terms, you get some number of units (I forget) that you can pass/fail. These can't be used on advanced hums or major/minor requirements, I believe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8) I've mostly taken core so far, but Ge1 has a weekend field trip which is pretty fun, and I enjoyed chem lab and organic chemistry a lot (I'm a CS major who happens to like chem). One of my hums this term was on the origins of science fiction and the other was game theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9) Uber, there's a metro station nearby, begging rides off friends, there's a bus to old pas which we get free passes for.

After that, how proof-based it remains depends on whether you take the practical or analytical track. I took the practical track and it was mostly applied with only a few less formal proofs. Second and third terms are linear algebra and multivariable, respectively.\n\n2)  This depends on the class. In general I haven't found this common, though exams will commonly extend the material to a more challenging problem that you may not have directly learned how to solve.\n\n3) The requirement I fulfilled by taking it was for 2 terms of either physics, chemistry (pchem or orgo), or biology beyond core. Most people I think take physics for it, but the others are options as well. ",

    "postText": "I've always been curious about IQ and its correlation to success, and I'm also curious about the IQ scores of people who've gone to Caltech and are probably considered significantly smarter than average.\n\nI'm a Caltech alum who got into Caltech with what was probably a typical record for Caltech students: valedictorian, near perfect SAT's, lots of AP exams and 5's on all of them, impressive math and science competition results. On iqtest.dk, which is said to be one of the more accurate online IQ tests, I scored 110, which is only considered the high end of average or slightly above average. On other online IQ tests I can't break 130. I've never taken an official IQ test, but on standardized tests as a kid, I scored very well in verbal intelligence but extremely poorly in spatial skills.\n\nIncidentally, I found Caltech's academics to be very difficult. Post-Caltech, my success has been mediocre. I've always come across as slow to other people, including those who didn't do well in school. ",

                    "comment": "Some IQ tests, such as the one at iqtest.dk, only include graphical puzzles, so that isn't really measuring education. \n\nMy SAT scores were almost perfect, so from that, my IQ should be on the high end. I also went to Caltech. However, on those inflated online tests where average people should be able to score in the 130's, I can only score below 130.\n\nAs a child, I did take tests that were kind of like IQ tests, although they didn't provide an IQ score. The tests had a section on graphical patterns as well as a math and verbal section. I could only score better than 20% of other people my age on the patterns, but I was better than something like 98% in math and verbal. Then one day I figured out how to look at the patterns and was able to get an average score. So far i haven't been able to figure out how to get an above average score.",

That said I don't know how it'd measure now, though if I remember correctly, IQ is supposed to be intrinsic and not change over your lifetime. I'm currently a junior btw. \n\nI remember hearing a study that said that once you are above a certain level of intelligence, any amount over that doesn't really contribute much to your success. I've also read that there are several issues with IQ. I'd find links but I'm on my phone at the moment. ",

            "comment": "No clue about my IQ; on the online tests, I've gotten everything from ~100 to ~150. But honestly, I suspect that IQ has a much lower correlation to success than just about any other factor - familial support, education quality, ability to function on little to no sleep. I don't consider myself anything special in the smarts department - I was always slow in math, and could never have come up with the brilliant ideas that some of my peers in undergrad did. That said, I think I made up for it in sheer pigheaded tenacity. I'm several years into grad school now, while several of my brilliant friends dropped out of undergrad due to WOW addictions, lack of time management skills, stress-induced health problems, etc. Assuming you have a reasonable baseline of intelligence+education, it's all the rest that determines how you fare.\n\nThat said, if you *really* want a number, you could try going backwards from SAT scores. Say Caltech's average was 1550/1600 (Just guessing; I have no idea what it really was). You could use some chart like [this](http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/GREIQ.aspx) to get an estimated IQ of ~155. Their interpolation method looks wildly unscientific, though.\n\nPS.Also, OP, *everyone* finds Caltech's academics difficult. Not the best teaching school, IMHO.\n\n\n",

            "comment": "I just took that test and got 138... Have you played SET? Seems like being good at SET would help you with that test. From what I've seen, IQ tests are just a bunch of pattern recognition, which I guess is one type of intelligence (I guess your poor spatial skills explains why you wouldn't score too well on IQ tests). But even if you could measure \"intelligence,\" that's not the same as success.",

Having spatial skills that are excessively poor compared to other skills is considered a learning disability.",

However, I only have a 110, if the test is to be believed. On tests taken as a kid, I was considered a massive overachiever, as in I should not have done as well as I did in school and was destined to eventually do poorly in school after a certain level. Apparently, that level was Caltech.\n\n_Edit:_ There were at least 13 questions on the test that I had trouble answering.",

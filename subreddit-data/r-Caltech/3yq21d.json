            "comment": "If by close you mean less than a mile, everything is fine. Going further afield it can be tricky; Pasadena and Altadena have many pockets of good/sketchy areas. There are some general rules though\n\n1) North of 210 and West of Lake is generally rougher\n\n2) Named neighborhoods (Bungalow Heaven, Madison Heights, Garfield Heights) are generally good.\n\n3) East of campus (either North or South) is fine\n\nI'd recommend you look at places and then ask for opinions at /r/pasadena about a particular block/area.\n",

Mine didn't, it was just a gas space heater, and it was AWFUL to keep turning the heat on/off in the winter. Also not all Pasadena apartments have Charter internet available so make sure the place does (or at least has some high-speed option).",

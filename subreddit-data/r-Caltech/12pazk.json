    "postText": "I had a few postcards from the Caltech bookstore I bought a few years ago when I spent a summer there on an internship, and was planning on using them in a scrapbook I'm making.  They got accidentally thrown out soon after I'd dug them out recently, and I can't seem to find any way of getting any online or anything.  I'm on the east coast and I no longer have any friends that are at the school, so I was hoping I could get someone who's still there to send me one or two - anyone want to help me out?  I could certainly paypal a few bucks for the trouble.",

    "postText": "Hi, I revived my Reddit account from the dead for this.\nI've been wanting to apply to Caltech but I'm so sceptical about the English program. The most I can find is on the official site and one Reddit thread here made 8 years ago. What is the English regime like here now? Is it worth taking? I'm incredibly interested in the actual experience of the course so let me know :)",

Answer to the first question - absolutely not. Answer to the second question - absolutely yes. I took at least 3 or 4 English classes I loved (especially Gilmartin's).",

Because you must take 12 humanities in your 4 years, it's very easy to get an English major or minor. However, the program isn't accredited to give BAs so you will walk out with a BS in English.",

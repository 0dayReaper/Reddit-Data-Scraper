In a lot of the college recruitment events, I hear \"the student body is smart,\" or the \"profs are amazing\" though I think that is true in a lot of top colleges. What was the main factor that attracted you to Caltech over other equally rigorous schools.",

            "comment": "So I admit it\u2019s just hearsay, and might just be a myth Techers say to help us sleep at night, but as I understand it: There aren\u2019t very many other schools that have Caltech\u2019s level of academic rigor, even among peer institutions with similar (or greater) prestige (e.g. MIT). At least from my (very superficial) knowledge of similar schools\u2019 curricula, Caltech tends to have higher amounts of rigor/difficulty/workload.\n\nAs an example\u2014which, I must reiterate, might not be all that spectacular outside of my limited experience\u2014Caltech\u2019s mandatory first-term calculus class is entirely proof-based and spends the first two weeks on defining the real numbers from scratch (via Cauchy sequences, IIRC).\n\nThis level of rigor wasn\u2019t a reason I chose Caltech initially (because all I knew was that Caltech was hard, but not why, *per se*), but in hindsight it\u2019s one of my favorite things about the Institute. (Even so, many (most?) feel differently and are successful at Caltech anyway.)",

Obviously there is SURF, but even besides that, I think you would have to actively try to *not* participate in research in order to avoid it. Just as a result of a couple of classes, I ended up in research groups, which ended up with at least one author spot on a paper with a well respected professor. I have friends at peer institutions that definitely did not find research opportunities as easily.\n\nEdit: other considerations: MIT, Rose-Hulman, Mudd, Stanford, UCLA.",

            "comment": "Caltech was my dream school and the only \"top school\" I wanted to attend, for very immature reasons:\n\n1. I was told that the undergraduates at Caltech were smarter than the undergraduates at any other university in the U.S., and I wanted to be around those students\n\n2. My sister went to MIT and I wanted to stand out from her, as she was considered to be the \"hard-working and normal\" child in my family and I was considered to be the \"weirder but smarter\" child in my family\n\n3. Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and other similar schools rejected a lot of my older classmates who were incredibly smart and passionate about STEM and who had great academic records, and accepted a lot of my older classmates who were not as smart and not as passionate about STEM and who had worse academic records. That really bothered me. Caltech did not seem to do that nearly as much\n\nIn short, I was egotistical and insecure, and I was looking for a sense of identity; Caltech seemed to be able to provide that sense of identity.\n\nThat was the kind of answer you were looking for, right? =P Caltech did turn out to be an amazing, special place, and I would choose it again over any other school, but this time because of its small size, trusting and collaborative community, and extreme academic rigor. I now believe those are its most distinguishing qualities among the set of highly ranked universities in the U.S.",

I can't imagine the idea of having to have taken a final *in a proctored exam room* lol. I did pretty much everything in the middle of the night while listening to the Glee cover of \"Just the way you are\" blasting in headphones on loop, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",

    "postText": "I'm an undergrad in India, and our summer term is from May to July. I've talked to a prof already and she's agreed to take me but the problem is that the SURF results will be announced on the 1st of April. Getting the Visa ready will take a month is what I hear (best case scenario, 1 and a half months more realistically) and cause of this I won't be able to complete 10 weeks unless I miss a couple weeks of classes in the fall term.\n\nIs there any way to get to know the results early (and the I-20 form for the Visa)? Is the SURF office flexible that way? Please tell me what options I have, cause I don't know much about Visa applications either.\n\nThanks in advance.",

She took me in because a prof I worked with before knew her and recommended me. So I can't really tell you how these interviews go, if lots of people are applying to the same project.\n\nGood luck though!",

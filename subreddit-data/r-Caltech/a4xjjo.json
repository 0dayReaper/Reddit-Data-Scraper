    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm a high school senior, and two days ago I was deferred from Caltech EA fall 2019. Caltech is my first choice of schools, and my second is Harvey Mudd. I can either do ED 2 there or do RD. So here are my questions:\n\n1. What are the odds that I'll get in to Caltech after being deferred? If it is very low, I will go ahead and apply to HMC ED2 (binding). If there is a chance, I'll RD to HMC. Does anyone have any statistics on this?\n\n2. What material can I send Caltech now that will help my case? I sent recommendation letters from my Physics and Geography teachers, should I send one from my math teacher as well? Should I write a letter of continued interest or something like that? If so, what can I put on there? \n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Definitely write a letter of continuing interest if you have done anything that could contribute further to your application - eg I was involved in research during the school year but hadn\u2019t had the chance to do much yet when I wrote my EA app, or if you\u2019re involved in a club, that sort of thing, besides which writing the letter shows that you are still committed to the school. I also submitted another letter of rec, if the teacher you would ask has good things to say about you, then would recommend.",

The problem sets are killer.  HM tries to do that, but students actually dream of high GPAs and regular jobs at Google and Microsoft.  Students at CalTech who are in the middle of their class still go to grad school and become professors or work in industry in research positions.  Middle of the road students at HM have GPAs that keep them out of good grad schools and keep them out of top companies, so while well-educated (and damaged from stress), they end up with second and third tier employment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalTech strives to produce the world's best engineers and scientists, and it succeeds.  HM, not so much, but it manages to crush the students with difficulty of the material.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharitable advice: Skip HM.  Go somewhere easier, get a 4.0, finish undergrad in 3 years with substantial research experience, get into CalTech for masters.  A lot of the top schools are easier to get into for a master's degree than for undergrad.",

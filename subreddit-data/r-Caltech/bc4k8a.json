The air quality in Los Angeles was at ~Beijing levels at some point (Prof. Phinney talks about how was an undergrad here for almost a full year before he knew there were mountains because the smog was so bad). \n\nYou can also look at this map from the WHO about PM2.5 levels: http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/sdei/sdei-global-annual-gwr-pm2-5-modis-misr-seawifs-aod/sdei-global-annual-gwr-pm2-5-modis-misr-seawifs-aod-2000.jpg. They aren't that bad in general in the US, with developing countries with unsustainable energy sources such as wood burning and indoor charcoal use which create substantially more anthropological PM2.5 than modern cars. In fact, I've seen similar plots without the dust and other natural contaminants removed and the US doesn't show up at all because of PM2.5 levels in the deserts. \n\nI'm not saying we're perfect, I'm just saying that the levels in Pasadena, Los Angeles, or the US in general is not the most egregious levels. The current WHO standard of 10 ug/m^3 (which is rife to change) is met by all US cities.",

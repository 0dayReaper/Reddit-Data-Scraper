    "postText": "I was accepted to Caltech EA, and my preferred major is Physics and/or Mathematics. Caltech has been my top choice for college for a while, however, I am not sure if it is worth the cost to attend. My parents make over 300k per year in income, so I could not qualify for any need-based financial aid. Moreover, my parents refuse to cover any part or portion of my college education. I was only able to receive under 5k in merit scholarships(not including national merit finalist). Thus, I was wondering, given that I wanted to pursue academia if it would be worth the large debt I would have to incur to attend Caltech, or if there were any other ways to reduce the cost of attendance aside from financial need.\n\nThanks for your help",

Getting married for this purpose is actually a lot [more common](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4wbeqg/how-some-students-are-using-fake-marriages-to-get-financial-aid) than you'd think.

            "comment": "Side note that won't directly affect OP, but undergrad tuition is such a negligible fraction of Caltech's overall cash flow (most comes from donations and research grants) that there was a serious push to just abolish all tuition in 90s.  The measure didn't pass, not for any actual budgetary consideration but because the big brains at the top of the administration with their business school degrees reasoned that if Caltech tuition cost $0 that would imply by definition that a Caltech education was worthless.  So they kept the sticker price high.  Now incoming students have to deal with this crap for practically no reason.\n\nEDIT: just look at these numbers lmao https://finance.caltech.edu/Resources/financials.  Tuition accounts for literally &lt;1% of revenue cash flows, and even less when you look at the YoY endowment growth.  Absolutely bonkers that we put our students through this crap",

Caltech gives out a shit-ton of financial aid and my impression is most students receive a substantial amount, so charging tuition largely punishes students who are in unusual family circumstances (e.g. high-earning unsupportive parents).",

It might have been feasible to work your way through college when they did, but, quite simply, the debt you amass in the US will be crushing in your early career. Additionally, many colleges have mostly eliminated merit scholarships and moved to entirely need-based aid. So even if you were the best student who ever applied you wouldn't get a dime of aid with their income.",

A family of middle-age earners who make $300k/yr may not have saved enough for the $320k to be a trivial amount of money. Parents may be making a very reasonable decision not to compromise their retirement.\n\nDo you think going to Caltech at full cost instead of another, cheaper school will pay off financially?",

No offense, but even if parents making,$300K haven't saved a penny for their kid to go to college, if tueir lifestyle is sufficiently extravagant that it's impossible to tighten the belt enough to survive off of $240K for just four years, then it's probably worth asking themselves about their priorities.  If the problem is that they can't afford the mortgage, why was it necessary to buy a house so expensive?  Is it possible to refinance?  What is the purpose of making all that money, if not to strive for the best possible opportunities for your children?  Set aside whether it \"pays off financially,\" the answer is probably no if you're looking at it like a stock portfolio or a rental property.  But Caltech is a unique experience with a collection of the absolute best minds on the planet, and the fact that a kid got in means they have a real shot not just at making good money but maybe even changing the world.  But heaven forbid their rich parents have to give up buying a new Tesla, going to expensive restaurants or lavish vacations for a few years to give them that unique opportunity",

Their intellectual ability, the things they have done, what they are studying or working on, etc. Also, if they have graduated, what they are up to now.\n\nThis question was inspired after watching [Real Genius](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/) waaay too many times. So are there any Chris Knight-like students you know?",

By the second or third lecture, we were already beyond the scope of the textbook we were using. I've seen some of the upper level classes he teaches and some of the current research he's doing and they all seem to be at the same level. \n\nReally brilliant guy. He's likely going to be responsible for breakthroughs in quantum information in the near future. ",

    "postText": "I'm pasting in here the text of an email that went out to all of Caltech:\n\nThe travel restrictions of the executive order of January 27th have introduced uncertainty and difficulty into the lives of many of the international scholars of our community. In response, a group of concerned faculty is convening an open gathering in support of Caltech's international scholars. All students, postdocs, staff, and faculty are invited. A plan for this event was presented at a recent Institute-wide faculty meeting and was met with overwhelming support.\n\nThis gathering will take place next Wednesday, March 1st, at 12:15pm, outside, at the Millikan Pond, which is on the east side of Millikan Library. Members of the Caltech community, including several faculty, will give short speeches. A primary objective of this gathering is to provide the Caltech community with the opportunity to sign a large poster with the statement:\n\n\"We, as members of the Caltech community, stand by our international scholars who have been affected by travel restrictions.\"\n\nAlthough the short speeches will conclude at 1pm, the poster will remain available for signing until 2pm. We encourage all who feel strongly about these issues to participate, and to sign our collective statement of support.\n\nHere's a FB event that you can share:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1860020000902300/",

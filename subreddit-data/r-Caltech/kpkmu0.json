If you\u2019re looking for the college experience portrayed in movies, with super popular sports games, barely any work, tons of people, and nonstop partying, you\u2019re not going to find it here. That\u2019s not to say that the experience here isn\u2019t fun, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a lot of work you have to prioritize in order to survive. \n\nAnother probably obvious point, there\u2019s only (real) STEM majors here. Don\u2019t come here if you want to major only in humanities. All of the humanities majors we offer are designed to be double majors, and actually require you to take STEM courses (which ideally you\u2019re doing in your other major). \n\nMost of the other negative aspects are probably self evident (for example, &lt;1000 undergrads, everyone knows everyone). If you\u2019ve got more specific questions, feel free to ask.",

            "comment": "Speaking for undergraduate Caltech engineering:\n\nAs stated earlier, it's small and insular. There is little diversity in thought or in the image of success. It's a science school so you graduate without knowing a lot of the practical applications employers are looking for (ie, they want to know if you can use Ansys, not if you can calculate a FEA by hand)\n\nThe terms are short and the instruction is highly variable. You're sleep deprived and stressed so you're unable to remember things no matter how much you try.\n\nI did my masters at a well known \"competitive\" engineering school and it was downright achievable. I feel like I actually learned there. \n\nI've since been involved with extensive hiring of entry level to mid career engineers and I would mark Caltech as a demerit. I would rather hire from top public engineering programs (ie, Calpoly, Purdue, UIUC) because their grads are better suited for working in a corporate environment.\n\nI assume you're trying to decide where to go to college. If you want to study science / get a PhD, it's the right school. If the financial aid package is better than your local state school, go to Caltech. If you got into MIT, go to MIT. If you're a grad student, go to Caltech.",

Econ was legitimately just an incredibly easy major to get (all the social sciences are), I did it because I knew I for sure wasn't staying in math/academia and I wanted a second (potentially more employable) major listed on my degree.\n\nI like to tell a story that my proudest moment of undergrad was that I was reading Lang (an algebra textbook in the \"graduate texts in mathematics\" series) and he was like \"it's now obvious to see that....\" and IT WAS OBVIOUS hahahaha. And that story is only like..50% meme, it actually was an incredibly amazing feeling to be keeping up with the text that well that the author saying to me \"this is obvious\" was in fact obvious.

As a bio major, I can only say that the idea that a math major could be described as \"easy\" evokes such a visceral horror in me. Since the curriculum often veers hard into the theoretical and analytical, you essentially need to have a very strong understanding of the basics and the general process of the subject. If you don't live and breathe math, you're gonna have a bad time in a math major. It's not impossible, but I cannot ethically condone such a decision if you're not \"comfortable\" with math. Pick the major you vibe hardest with.",

Now, Don't get me wrong, It's an amazing school and absolutely one of the best (imo the best, please don't kick me out) colletes you can go to for what it does, BUT it's very specific. Caltech is, at its core, a RESEARCH institution. You come to Caltech because you want to be a researcher. Maybe you want to go into academia, maybe you want to go into the private sector, maybe you want to work at NASA or JPL, but you don't come to Caltech if your only goal is to get your MD. No hate on people who want their MD, but Caltech is basically optimized to help you get a Ph.D. and you're probably better off starting your MD at a UCLA or Stanford. Caltech is where you go if you want to get into a top-tier master degree program with your name on 2+ research papers and a strong understanding of research methods. Speaking from my field, Bio majors at Caltech are taught first and foremost about lab techniques at the molecular/cellular level. You can graduate with a degree in Bio without ever having taken a course on human anatomy. If you just want to pass your MCAT(or, heaven forbid, your BAR), Caltech is not the best place (If you're even considering Caltech, you'll be fine anyway but you probably have better options). All of that out of the way, there are still people who come to Caltech as a start to an MD PhD, or start with research but switch into an MD program, or even just want an MD, and all of those are completely valid. At the end of the day, do what makes you happy. If you want to get elbow deep into frontier research in your 2nd year, I don't think you can make a better choice than Caltech, but that doesn't mean that all Caltech students HAVE to be so focused (heaven knows im not, now that i think about it an MD PhD doesnt sound too bad...)\n\nTLDR: Caltech is the best place for those going into research, results may vary for any other specialization.",

Yeah, Caltech sort of has other options now, but the House system remains very central to the environment and experience and socializing and venting and relaxing and escaping, in both good and bad ways.\n\nClimate.  It's located in Southern California.  The weather is great most of the year, but the weather is great most of the year.  This can be good or it can be distracting because one isn't forced to be inside studying. There is no change of seasons with leaves turning colors.\n\nCampus. Caltech has a well-defined campus.  It's a cocoon. It's not a university that occupies a subset of buildings on the streets of a city.  The grounds of the campus are fairly open but the buildings generally are well-secured.  This can give a false sense of security.\n\nLocation. The campus is located in Pasadena, close to Los Angeles, but sort of in the middle of nowhere.  There is no \"university town\", nor Westwood Village like UCLA. One side of the campus borders a very expensive, posh suburb. Pasadena City College is adjacent on another side, but there is almost no interaction. Old Town Pasadena is not very far away, but not at the edge of campus.  Beaches and mountains are far enough away to be inconvenient but close enough to be distracting. A car is very useful, but one needs to contend with Los Angeles traffic.\n\nThe Administration. The administrators now mostly are professional administrators hired from other academic institutions who don't understand the history or culture of Caltech. The administration sometimes can be heavy-handed and condescending, not understanding the delicate mixture of maturity of the very intelligent student population.\n\nThe Faculty. The faculty, like the students, is very high caliber. Great researchers and great opportunities for research internships, but not always the best teachers. And the faculty members are very ambitious and competitive.\n\nAcademics. The entire environment is \"up one level\" from most universities. Undergrads can and generally are expected to do the work that graduate students would do at other universities.  Graduate students are post docs.  Post docs are assistant professors. Etc. It's great for opportunity and responsibility, but it inhibits some of the normal undergraduate experience, as mentioned by others.",

Everyone here is here specifically because they would love nothing more than to spend 110% of their time doing the thing they love. That means that if you're the kind of kid that loves to make nerdy references to history or just casually uses overly convoluted metaphors to describe basic things, you'll be in good company.

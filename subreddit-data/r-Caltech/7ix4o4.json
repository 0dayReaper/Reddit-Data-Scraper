            "comment": "Here's what a typical CS schedule looks like. Technically, you don't need to take cs courses until sophomore year, but that is a really poor decision, and the majority of CS majors do a significant amount of frontloading to be more employable for internships/industry and also to spread out difficult courses. \n\n**Frosh 1st term:** CS 1\n\n**Frosh 2nd term:** CS 2 or CS 21. I don't recommend taking both at the same time. \n\n**Frosh 3rd term:** CS 24 or CS 38 (again, don't recommend taking both)\n\n**Sophomore 1st term:** Ma 6a. By now, most people will have taken a CS11. This term is usually used to catch up on hums/social science. Some CS majors take non-cs courses such as ACM95a, EE51 (a class that no longer exists :(), Ch41a, etc. out of ~~masochism~~ interest. Some CS majors start a CS track, such as CS 121 (databases). \n\n**Sophomore 2nd term:** CS 4, and usually finishing up CS 2 or CS 21\n\n**Sophomore 3rd term:** CS 38 or CS 24, depending on which you didn't do.\n\n**Junior Year:** most people take a CS track or two, depending on what you want to do. I basically took 1 Machine Learning class and 1 networks class every term. Classes like CS 121, CS 115, CS 156a are popular add ons. CS majors also typically take some math courses, as they are required. A significant portion of Junior year is spent hunting for internships.\n\n**Senior Year:** Senior year is spent working on ditch day (it's tomorrow by the way), catching up on humanities/social sciences, job hunting, taking odds and ends classes or research, and crying about our GPAs. Seniors typically take more reading courses and project courses vs seminar based CS courses. Some seniors tackle a thesis, a big project in the form of \"independent project\" courses. Other Seniors spend a great deal of time acting as a TA for certain courses (highly recommend this experience)\n\nHope this answers your question",

The 5th course can be an elective, e.g. you could choose some of CS1, CS21, CS11, Ma6ab for first year. There's some info here: http://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/ugrad_cs The second year schedule looks similar to what people actually took, except that CS1 was generally taken in the first year (and sometimes CS21 also). The course titles on that page are rather bad though, CS21 is undergrad complexity theory, CS4 is functional programming, CS24 is operating systems.",

If you place out of CS1 or parts of Ma1 or Ph1 you can take more classes (e.g. Ma6 or Ma2 or a frosh lab), or get ahead on your humanities requirements. There's plenty of time to finish the major and take electives so you'll be fine even if only end up doing core + CS1 the first year. I would recommend taking a heavier workload only if it wouldn't make you really unhappy.",

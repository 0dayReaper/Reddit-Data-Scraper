Both my GPA and SAT were below middle 50%, but extracurriculars, course rigor, and passion for STEM is what they really want to see. At least that\u2019s what I think got me in. If you are genuinely interested in CS, have demonstrated that interest through the classes you have taken and the clubs you have been a part of, then yes you will be competitive.",

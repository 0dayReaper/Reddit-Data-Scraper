    "postText": "First seen through a YouTube ad, I subscribed to hear more about a bootcamp being offered at Caltech. So far, they have been calling about once a week, and I get emails daily. They had been reaching out by phone nearly everyday a few weeks ago when I said I was looking to join in mid November, and every time it was someone with an Indian accent.\n\nMy questions is... Is this a legitimate bootcamp???? I have seen or heard of scams in different forms, but their email address seems legit and so does the website, obviously looking like Caltech's very own. But I honestly don't know???! The price seems reasonable to be honest. But beyond that, the same area code as me, sometimes coming up as scam, and Indian accent on the phone every time?",

            "comment": "So Caltech recently (~3 years ago?) started offering boot camps, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not affiliated with us other than the brand name. It\u2019s possible that they have some prerecorded content from Caltech faculty, but you\u2019re not going to have them teaching the boot camp actively. The bootcamps specifically seem to be run by FullStack Academy, which runs programs at other schools too. I\u2019d guess they license big school names to make the bootcamp more appealing but it isn\u2019t that special, nor are you actually getting the benefit of the university experience (although it might sneak you by a clueless hiring manager). \n\nWe do have an unrelated but much more official program called the Schmidt Academy for Software Engineering, which cross trains CS and more general science to produce programmers who can write good code for use in labs. Basically, Caltech labs hire developers for projects to get much better quality code (scientists usually don\u2019t program terribly well, or at least not in line with software engineering best practices) without wasting the time of grad students. I only know about this because someone I know did this after graduation a few years back, I think in the first year the program existed. It\u2019s possible that people joining this program get put into the Caltech boot camps, but I\u2019m really not sure. \n\nOne other note, neither of these programs interact much, if at all, with the rest of the student body. As an undergrad, I honestly had no idea we offered these or what the details were until googling for this post, and I\u2019m kind of disappointed that we have the bootcamps at all.",

I could see how it could provide a boost to a software engineering or computer science degree in perhaps honing your skills further to stand out in a job application. But they'll just take anyone without even asking or caring how bright you are.",

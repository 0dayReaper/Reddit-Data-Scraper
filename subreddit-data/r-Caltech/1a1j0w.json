    "postText": "I am going to Caltech this summer as a research student, and I wanted to know if you guys had any advice on what would be the best way to spend my free time out there. I have never visited the western US, and my current PI suggested that I take time to appreciate what Caltech and Pasadena have to offer outside of research. ",

There's so much more fun stuff to do with a car: concerts, clubs, shows, museums, hiking trips, amusement parks.  Most of these are doable by public transit, but it's much more tiring.\n\nThats my two cents.  Source: Caltech Undergrad who did summer SURF a few years ago",

It's out of Griffith park, and you get an amazing view of LA and all the surrounding cities.\n\nIn my opinion the beaches weren't great, but it's still pretty cool to check out the boardwalk at Santa Monica.\n\nThere are also a ton of good restaurants in Pasadena and the surrounding area. If you've never had Korean BBQ, make it a point to do so!\n\nI'd highly recommend getting to know people who are students at Caltech; you will probably have more tips and cool things to do, provided you find the right group.\n\nThe best thing you can do is plan ahead, so you don't end up sleeping in on weekends and ending up doing nothing. Even if you don't befriend car owners, the gold line runs from a little over a mile away from campus into Union Station which can take you a lot of places, and there's also Zipcar (though I'm not sure if you'd be able to reserve those as a non-Caltech student - you should confirm with Zipcar if you're interested). It's not a bad option if you get 4 people to split the car, ~20 bucks for a car and the gas is free (assuming you don't go over 180 miles for the day). PM me for more details if you'd like.",

            "comment": "I worked with a summer student from England last year.  He ended up doing a lot of nature trips.  We have some really awesome nature out west, if you've never been out here doing a Yosemite trip or Grand Canyon trip can be very awesome.  There's so many things you can do involving the outdoors that if you are at all interested let me know!\n\nCertain attractions I really enjoy (Tar pits and Getty especially, or Huntington Gardens closer to home), some can be overrated (Hollywood), but there's a lot to explore, that's for sure.  If you're not from Chicago or NY (or some other large, mixed, metropolitan area) , I'd say be sure to try out all the ethnic food, as we have everything from little Ethiopia to K-town. ",

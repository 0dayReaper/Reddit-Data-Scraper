I have previous research experience from last summer at UCLA and the professor I worked with back then would write me a recommendation if that helps.\n\nI'm interested specifically in the [Starshade](http://announcements.surf.caltech.edu/index.cfm?event=ViewAODetail&amp;id=1257&amp;inFrame=&amp;type=SURF&amp;formType=AO_JPL) and [Micro Wall Climbing Robots](http://announcements.surf.caltech.edu/index.cfm?event=ViewAODetail&amp;id=1208&amp;inFrame=&amp;type=SURF&amp;formType=AO_JPL) projects.\n\nAre my chances good if I can pull a decent GPA?",

If you talk to a professor before hand and they accept you, you're pretty much good unless you literally spend no effort on your surf proposal and have below a 3.0. \n\nThe ones you mentioned are actually JPL surfs, which probably has more interns from not Caltech than actually from Caltech. I know a student who probably knows more about the Micro Wall Climbing Robots project because she worked in the same building as them.\n\nHowever, do note that some JPL mentors aren't looking for Freshmen as much as they want people with some sort of background. It never hurts to ask, and it's never too early to start communicating with them and keep a channel of communication open. ",

I've personally worked with several first-years, and other grad students in my lab have taken students from other universities. So there's a chance.",

I love Caltech and I\u2019m not even a top student or anything.\n\nAll of the students worked their asses off to get here.  And when you get into Caltech it feels like a finish line of some sort.  Buts it\u2019s not, in fact everyone is still running top speed!  Faster and faster we run as we look to the left and right of us.  So tired from this long race, we are!  But still, we keep running.  The people that do well are those who like to run.  The people whose life long dream was to cross this immaculate finish line, stumble and often stop running from burn out.  \n\nI have no idea what you want and what your goals are.  But if you want to go to Caltech, you have to have enjoyed the slow burn of getting there in the first place because it IS very hard.  (What does very hard mean, you ask?)  I know many who have literally become changed people.  As if the work and the stress and the competition accumulated into some form of PTSD.  I laugh at what other schools have for homework in comparable classes (yes, even MIT).  And although sometimes it feels like there is no end to all of this work, if you love to run you\u2019ll be fine.  \n\nAs for the ACM major, I have a lot of respect for ACM people.  Always very thoughtful and bright students.  There is healthy collaboration from what I\u2019ve seen.    Caltech has a great ACM curriculum and I would love to have been an ACM major in a perfect world.",

There's a balance to strike, since for me I can't work alone in my room, but it's easy to get too distracted by too many friends.\n\nFor me, house dinners are a huge part of socializing and it's a time I carve out of my schedule to not think about work, try not to be on my phone, try to talk to friends.\n\nWe do have parties and stuff (houses do social events within their house, and then we have large, high-effort parties run by a house called interhouses), but a lot of it is either something you plan your schedule around in advance, or low effort things when you need a break from staring at some work. Like, if you're planning on partying on Saturday and being hung over on Sunday, your Friday (and probably Thursday) is going to be spent finishing all the work you need to have done by Monday. But usually you can find people playing sports or smash bros or whatever at any time of day.\n\nI think it's possible to have good grades, good sleep, and a good social life, but it requires being very mindful about what you do with your time, which is difficult. Like, when I got to tech I uninstalled all my video games, cut way back on my reddit use, and deleted most of my social media that I'd spend hours scrolling on. Likewise, you only have so much time for social activities, which you need to balance between your house, your family, any romantic partners you might have, clubs, etc.",

My junior year as a EE, I basically was up until 5 or so in the morning every week night.  Had some time on the weekends to go out, but that was it.\n\nWe also worked hard and played hard. Unhealthy binge drinking was not unusual.\n\nYou will not get anything resembling a normal college social life at Tech. You can party on the weekends, but that's it. It's not unexpected to spend like 50 hours a week on problem sets.\n\nIt's tough. Probably the toughest undergrad experience in the world.",

If you're looking for socialization outside of work, you'll find yourself a good bit of free time to socialize as long as you can finish your sets in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nI always managed to have enough time to fuck around with my buds, but there were definitely some weeks where sleep was a scarce commodity.",

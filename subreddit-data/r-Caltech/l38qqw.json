    "postText": "Hi folks, I\u2019m a prospective PhD student planning to visit campus tomorrow to see what it\u2019s like.\n\nI found a self-guided walking tour online, but I\u2019m wondering if you have any personal suggestions on what to see while I\u2019m here. I\u2019m interested in your favorite spots at Caltech, as well as in Pasadena. (Of course, I don\u2019t expect to enter any buildings because of covid).\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "postText": "So I was interested in doing a summer fellowship, and I went through all the necessary steps; contacting a person, interviewing, etc, and it all went fine. But I just finished my first semester at college, and it looks like my GPA isn't going to be nearly as good as I was hoping it to be. Looking back, I really screwed up in the last couple of weeks, missing a few labs and online quizes, but it seems like the highest GPA I think I could get for this term is a 2.466, though I think realistically I will be getting something more like a 2.2-2.3. This wouldn't be a problem, except I am not a caltech student, so the requirement for me is a minimum 2.5. This entire situation has me in a bit of a downward spiral as a result. On one hand, I reached out and did a bit of work to try to secure an opportunity, and on the other, I screwed up my first semester. Again, looking back I realize that I definitely didn't do as well as I could have, and if I had put in a little more effort in the final month, I would have had a much better GPA, one that wouldn't take me here for this. And looking forward to my next semester, I am positive that I will be doing much better (I will be getting some help, study groups, etc.)\n\nMy question is this; would it be possible to still apply to SURF regardless? I know that in some places, the minimum GPA is more of a \"can you do the work\" kind of thing, which is something I don't have a problem with, and I have no doubt that  my next term GPA (and my GPA for the year) will be well above the 2.5 minimum. Would it be possible to apply with the requirement that my year end GPA is high enough/use my mid-semester grades in the consideration? or am I in the very awkward position of having to let the professor know that I will be withdrawing my interest because of academic difficulties?\n\nThanks in advance.",

They used to be jerks, but it can't hurt to ask.\n\nAlso, you can definitely *say* \"I have no doubt my GPA will rise,\" but we've all seen this happen a hundred times, and sometimes it rises and sometime it doesn't. There is absolutely no way for the SURF office or the professor to know that you'll be good for it. There are sadly no such thing as \"mid-semester\" grades. So ask what you can do, and do that.\n\nAlso, don't kick yourself if you fail to get in. I did no research after my freshman year (I did IT) and got a PhD from Princeton. You're safe no matter what. Just make backup plans.",

As it is right now, I think I will be working outside of SURF anyways (which is fine, since I find the work really interesting) but even then, this makes me a little more relaxed. \n\nI should also clarify I already reached out, and am just waiting to hear if the professor is going ot be able to take me (a freshman) this summer.",

I'm not certain how they change for people not from the Caltech undergrad pool, but a poor first term GPA shouldn't really keep you out. I know Techers who have had harder terms than you (failed &gt;=3 classes first term) and still been awarded SURFs.\n\nContact the SURF office at sfp(at)caltech(dot)edu, and if you don't get a response from them, call Candace Rypisi, director for SURF at 626.395.2886.\n\nAlso contact the professor you have already contacted again. If the professor wants you for a SURF, and is willing to fund you for it, the SURF office is very unlikely to say no.",

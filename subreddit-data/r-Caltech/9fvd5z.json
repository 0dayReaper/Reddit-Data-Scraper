If you're looking for a nice drink within walking distance of campus I'd suggest Magnolia House or T. Boyles Tavern. A short drive away in Old Pasadena my favorites are the Speakeasy (you have to email them for the password and you enter through the back alley), White Horse Lounge, and Lucky Baldwin's Pub. I think there are a couple clubs in Old Pasadena but I've heard they're kinda lame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn downtown Los Angeles I would definitely recommend the Edison (a steampunk nightclub with absinthe fairies and a really cool vibe).",

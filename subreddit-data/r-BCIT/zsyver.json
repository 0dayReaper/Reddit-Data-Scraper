            "comment": "I don't know the CIT recommended laptop specs but would assume that they're like the CST ones. My recommendation would be a laptop with an Intel Core i7 processor, 8+ GB of RAM and Windows 11. In the sub-$1000 range, you'll probably only find refurbished devices. Keep an eye out on Boxing Day though. You can get Windows 11 Education free through Azure Dev Tools using your BCIT account, so I wouldn't worry if the devices run Windows 11 Home at time of purchase. Below are two examples of devices that meet the criteria. For \\~$1,100 with a student discount, you could also get a new ThinkBook from Lenovo.\n\n[https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/hp-15-6-touchscreen-laptop-natural-silver-intel-core-i7-1255u-1tb-ssd-16gb-ram-win-11-open-box/16250997](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/hp-15-6-touchscreen-laptop-natural-silver-intel-core-i7-1255u-1tb-ssd-16gb-ram-win-11-open-box/16250997)\n\n[https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/open-box-samsung-galaxy-book2-15-6-laptop-graphite-intel-core-i7-1255u-256gb-ssd-8gb-ram-win11/16488741](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/open-box-samsung-galaxy-book2-15-6-laptop-graphite-intel-core-i7-1255u-256gb-ssd-8gb-ram-win11/16488741)",

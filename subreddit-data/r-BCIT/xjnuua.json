    "postText": " \n\nThought I would make a quick post about the cheapest internet I\u2019ve found in Vancouver since moving here. As I'm a student I want to save wherever I can and so I convinced my roommate to switch internet providers and we haven't been happier!  I'm using the 75/Mbps for 49/month with no lag on all 8 devices, and no contract. Check it out!\n\nAlso, using my referral code you'll get a free month when you sign up: R5SA57A.\n\n[https://oxio.ca/en/internet](https://oxio.ca/en/internet)",

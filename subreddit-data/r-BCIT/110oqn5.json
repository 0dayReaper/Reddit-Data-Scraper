Is it Impark?",

You could use an expired credit card and it would still spit out a ticket. I'm not sure if it was just a shitty system where it accepted the card and wouldn't charge it until the end of the day. And I don't know about now, but having to walk through the lot every day after school I'd often see kids from the highschool pull tickets off the cars. Owner would never even know they had a ticket until they showed up one day and their car was possibly towed. Wouldn't be surprised if the kids are still doing this.",

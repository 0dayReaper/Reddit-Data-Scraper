    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI would like to know how long it takes to become an Instrumentation Technician.\n\nI know that BCIT has the Industrial Instrumentation and Process Control Technician diploma (2 years), but then there is the Instrumentation and Control Technician Apprenticeship (4 years).\n\nSo would I already be qualified as an Instrumentation Technician if I were to complete the diploma, or would I have to upgrade or take another program?\n\nAlso, are the job prospects different for both the diploma and apprenticeship?\n\nThanks for the help!",

            "comment": "Hey! So I did the diploma. You count as a second year after graduating so you go into year 3 of the apprenticeship program with some hours counted towards your red seal l. I believe you need 3600 hours. The apprentice program year one is if you have a job but no education.",

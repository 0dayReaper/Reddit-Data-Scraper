    "postText": "It's been quite some time since I've taken a course, I'd say 10+ years easily. I'm considering switching my job a bit and move to a different position but I need to take just a few more courses for that to happen. I need to upgrade my math skills and see that the course I need naturally needs a pre-requisite, and that one needs a pre-requisite as well. My math has never been my strong point and I'm looking at how it says you've 3 attempts to complete a course, but what is one to do if they can't do it in that many attempts? Not saying I can't pass them, but I'm wondering what someone would do in that situation? Do they find an alternative school and try there and possibly have the credits transferred over? Or is it a tough luck, you tried and failed, go reassess your life and pick a new career?",

The administrators may even work with the teacher to try and figure out what is causing you to fail and try and find a solution. All the teachers I\u2019ve met at BCIT are there to teach and are very good at it, they want you to succeed and will help you as much as they can. Someone failing reflects poorly on them and their ability to teach as well. And the community I\u2019ve found at bcit is very helpful as well, classmates are supportive and can be very helpful.",

[https://www.khanacademy.org/math/](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/) is a good one. \n\nGenerally math builds on itself. I find if I have trouble with something, it's usually because I have some gap in the foundation I need to go back and fill in. Understanding the concepts of a new level of math doesn't necessarily mean you can carry out the mechanics of solving the problem. So you might need to go back and review a bit before you can fully solve a problem. \n\nI'm not sure what courses you took 10+ years ago, but school should be treated like a job. The expectation is usually that you put in 2-3 hours outside of class for every hour in class. It varies by the difficulty of the subject, but you should aim to try and keep it consistent and just show up even early in the term. BCIT is good in that there are tutors and tutorials and you have accessible TAs. If you want to go for it, put in the work and get help early and often when you get stuck. \n\nYou can find study tips and other advice for scheduling your work if needed through a few Google searches.",

I highly doubt you will fail once, but if you do fail once I presume the second time around you will worker harder/get a tutor etc. highly highly unlikely someone uses their three chances. There also may be the chance of extra assignments for marks if your situation gets dire , depending on the teacher",

I went the ladder route due to more design jobs for technologists. It's a great field with a growing need for technologists and technicians alike. \n\nThe diploma program is quite tough so be prepared for a heavy load, and alot of lab work is very hands-on. You'll be exposed to all sorts of industry standards, practices, equipment, workshops, and design drawings. You're guaranteed a job right from graduation in both options because the demand is very high.",

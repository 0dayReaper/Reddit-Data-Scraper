    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI\u2019m currently working on the Business Admin Marketing diploma. My program isn\u2019t declared though because I still need to do one more required class to register for the program, but I\u2019m done 85% of the courses for the Diploma. I realized not too long ago I need a business admin certificate. Luckily I have the classes required and just need to do one more to be done the certificate. \n\nI have to make sure I get the certificate before the fall semester begins so I can apply for the diploma and finish up the remaining classes. I am going to apply for the certificate program this week as I heard it takes some weeks for them to get back to u, so should I apply for the certificate graduation two weeks into my course as it will take another few weeks for them to get back to me about graduation? How does graduation work for the certificate? Also what happens if I finish all required classes for the Business Admin Marketing diploma but don\u2019t have an average of 65%. I take a heavy course load therefore for one or two semesters my grades weren\u2019t the best.\n\nI know this kind of sounds confusing I tried explaining the best I could!",

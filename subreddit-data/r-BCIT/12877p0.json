    "postText": "Im applying for the fall 2023 cohort and was wondering how difficult it is to get an interview? I am applying with my hs grades however have a BSc in Biology. My bio, chem, and english grades are around 90 while physics are math are high 70s. I'm currently upgrading my physics to increase my gpa but am unsure if i'll have enough time to upgrade Pre-Calc 12. What are my chances of being accepted? Thanks :)",

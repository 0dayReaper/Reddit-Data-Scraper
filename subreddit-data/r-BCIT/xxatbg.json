    "postText": "I've heard some people start working full time after taking term 1 and 2 and doing an 8 month coop.  Are there options to continue schooling part time while working full time in order to obtain the complete diploma?  Would it be worth it to do this, or is it recommended to finish the diploma entirely before trying to enter the work force full time?",

            "comment": "You can switch to part-time CST after term 2 and co-op, but it is A LOT more expensive for each course. BCIT gives you a huge discount when you take the full-time course load. The part-time courses are also usually offered in the evenings or weekend. You will also have to take some pre-requisite courses to get into part-time CST that are missing from the full-time program with co-op (like an intro to computers course, Agile course, and Web Dev 2).\n\nThe part-time CST program works on a laddered system. What this means is that you have to incrementally earn smaller credentials and build up to your final part-time CST degree. So if you directly swap after co-op to PTS, you won\u2019t actually be in CST but the level underneath it.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve seen people do is to take a bunch of courses during their co-op in order to have a smaller workload during term 3 and 4. This way, you can work part-time while attending class full-time.\n\nI personally think it\u2019s not worth it to switch to part time CST if you had the choice. If you can secure a full-time offer from your co-op, and just finish the last two terms full-time before returning to your job, that would be ideal. Nevertheless, taking classes and working at the same time is not fun.",

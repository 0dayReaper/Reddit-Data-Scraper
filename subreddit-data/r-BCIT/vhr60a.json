I'm able to get a reasonable amount of interviews vs public, but I lack the raw skills to do the manager / senior level jobs at F500 companies.",

It took me ~4 months after graduated to actually get a (shitty) dev job, but every day I was practicing, building projects and sending out resumes.\n\nI understand a longer BCIT program is more comprehensive and prepares you more with the actual technical, computer science aspects, which FOR SURE come handy in interviews.",

In my cohort there is I think one other person working at least a couple shifts per week but I don't think anyone else is.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, 3DMAA is a program where you get out what you put in. If it's at all possible I'd recommend not working at all so you have more time to devote to your studies. By the end of 5th semester you will have your capstone project completed and a reel to send out to employers. If you just skate by and don't put in 110% your reel won't be as good as it needs to be and you'll need to take more time to refine it after graduation. \n\nEven working what I am right now I'm stressing about my reel so I wouldn't recommend you working at all if it's at all possible.",

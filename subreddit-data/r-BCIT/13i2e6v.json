    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m current CST student and graduating in coming months, and I\u2019m not too sure on what to do next. \n\nOriginally I was planning on doing the CST BTech and really wanted to do BSC, when I head it would transitioning to it. \n\nBut I\u2019m not sure if my time will be better spent learning in actual industry, while gaining experience.\n\nI wanted to hear from people who chose to work or study after CST, and what\u2019s it like.\n\nAlso on what\u2019s the workload for the current BTech like compared to CST diploma. Is it worst? Better? Or gotten used to the pain? Lol I really want to get some insight and make informed decision.",

            "comment": "* I did CST PTS - did not finish, just enough credits to get into the BTech, it's like 85% done.\n* I was already working in the tech industry.\n* I have just the major project and one course left in the BTech PTS.\n\nWith that in mind:\n\n* I found the BTech to be slightly easier. It is half the course-load of CST, and has more LIBS electives.\n* Caveat to that is the math, I found Linear Algebra way more difficult than any discrete math or CST stats. That's probably doubly true for Calculus in the BSc.\n* Bonus to the BSc, you might be able to sneak your way into P. Eng. I doubt the program will be officially sanctioned, but it will meet like 90% of the requirements and EGBC at least advertise alternate entry from unsanctioned programs.\n* Along the way I've encountered plenty of people who had no issue finding employment after CST.\n* Caveat to that - Conditions are probably not great right now. Big Tech lays off and it pushes everybody else down, surplus of developers/etc available and falling demand.",

I could have done it in 2 years if I could do it on my terms.\n\nAverage 3 classes per term, occasionally 4, now down to 2 per term as I have to wait for BCIT scheduling anyway.",

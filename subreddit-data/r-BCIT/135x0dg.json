    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am going to attend the CIT program this fall.  Is there anyone enrolled now or graduated giving some advice for the preparation?  I have no experience with IT and want to get ready in advance. \n\nAdditionally, can anyone share a class schedule for CIT Term 1?  I hope to learn something about the load in advance and make my plan.  Thanks a lot.",

They teach from the basics and help you to build a solid foundation, 1st term courses are not difficult;however, it would be challenging after the 2nd term. Try to ace the courses for your 1st term, it helps you to build confidence as it is very important in your study later on. Good luck.",

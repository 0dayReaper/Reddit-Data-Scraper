    "postText": "im looking to apply to the marketing management program right out of high school, how difficult is it to get in and how hard are the course workloads? i also have a strange question, would it be hard to get through the program if I'm more of a shy person? I'm really interested in the program but I heard in marketing you need to have a very outgoing and talkative personality.",

            "comment": "Hey! So the Marketing program involves a lot of collaboration and talking. Lot of the time, you will be presenting, in front of the class, and group. Also you will work in a lot of group projects. If you are shy, you will overcome that fear here. Everyone is very friendly, so when you start talking you won't feel shy anymore. Just keep confidence, self-respect, and character; and you'll be fine my brother.",

            "comment": "I'm currently in the marketing program, my journey was a little different than others, I started with the BFUN cert and worked up to the diploma (after this semester BBA as long as I don't fail capstone lol), some of the key insights I have are:  \n\\-You need friends you can rely on, now this may seem dangerous but everybody has different strengths I used to help people with marketing and they helped me with stats.  \n\\- TEACHERS MATTER GREATLY no matter what people say, the easier the teacher, the easier your life, one of the biggest strengths of the part-time program is being able to choose your teacher rather than rely on coordinators.\n\n\\- Coordinators are a great tool but remember they care about the school first then you, it may seem harsh but the person who makes your schedule is working for the school they will 1000% help you, but to get better profs and schedules it's worth being nice and polite.  \n\n\n\\- Marketing is actually one of the harder programs I'd rate it maybe 3rd-5th (CST &amp;Nursing yall scare me), the reason it's hard is because of the variety of courses given in one semester. You often hear CST students saying they need to change the way their brain works and marketing is similar to some degree.  \n\n\n\\- If you are shy it's okay, you will learn to put on a \"work face\" \n\n\\- If you would like my marks I know it was 76% for BFUN and currently 74% for the BA diploma (marketing option).  (avg 5-6 courses per sem) Core courses 74%. By no means am I an amazing student, barely considered a \"good\" student.  \n\n\n\\- If you choose the BBA after September 2023 you need a 70% average GPA and a minimum of 65% in each core course. \n\n\\-Core courses include Business Communications 2, Accounting 2 (or Accounting For Management), Essentials of Marketing, Macroeconomics, and Statistics.",

While most of my class was outgoing, the shy students often thought about things longer and had great ideas to contribute.\n\nAs I went on in my career I've hired lots of quieter marketers. Don't let the assumption you need to be loud stop you! Just be aware there is a lot of group work. It will really prepare you for the real world.",

As long as you stand well within your class, your enthusiastic, and have a great personal portfolio, resume you should be good. But remember, you need to present yourself in a well-presentable manner, because their will be a lot of other candidates applying, and they will contradict as to whether they want to choose you or not.",

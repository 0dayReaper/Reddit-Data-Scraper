I heard civil engineering is a competitive program, so try to at least get an A or very high B.",

It only lists grade 11 English in the first category, but not the other two. I assume it's because they are making the assumption that most people in grade 12 haven't finished English yet. So like do I just have to wait a year?",

I believe they base that off your average. So having high grades increases your chances of getting accepted. If you don't get accepted immediately, you'll be placed on the wait list. Whether it's for grades or not, you need to study hard(achieve high grades). Having a good foundation in physics and math will help you tremendously with the rigorous course load you'll be facing. You want to prepare yourself as much as possible.",

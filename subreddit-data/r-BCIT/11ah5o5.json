So many people living with their parents which means they can accept less pay because there\u2019s no rent, a really smart city so there\u2019s a lot of demand that employers haven\u2019t capitalized on to fill, which means people are underemployed. It\u2019d really a mystery why more companies don\u2019t base here if land prices weren\u2019t so high.",

Again nothing special networking in school so I would consider self learning and look for volunteer opportunities to gain skills (from cst grad).\nEven some of my friends who recently graduated from cst are having difficult time finding a job. Not saying CST diploma is anything special since diploma people need to compete with comp sci degrees and recently laid off people.\nPretty sure it going to get worse this year by looking at the market flow",

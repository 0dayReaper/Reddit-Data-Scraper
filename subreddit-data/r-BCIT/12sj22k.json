    "postText": "Hi all, my girlfriend(25F) recently got an offer of admission into the BITMAN program at BCIT. She is having some doubts about the program because she is worried about the outcome of the program. She is aware that she could get a business analyst job after the completion of the course.\n\nI, myself, am in the IT field as a network engineer. As I checked the courses in the program it seemed like a great fusion of data analytics, web development, and business applications. However, I wanted to ask you folks how has your experience been while you pursued your BITMAN program. How was the course load? and was it hard to find jobs after you graduated?\n\nAnd finally, would you say that this course was worth pursuing for you?",

For them, this program was worth it from my perspective, but it was more than just their education but what they done outside of their diploma.",

            "comment": "CIT is not as competitive as CST if you are interested.\n\nThough depends also in your goal. If your goal is to also have a bachelor's degree then you need to consider your options. For example: if you choose  CIT over CST diploma and want to have a bachelor's in CST, after CIT, you will take extra courses to be accepted in the bachelor's program.\n\nThough BITMAN is good program also. There's more data management and scrapping in that course which is in-demand right now in this information age.",

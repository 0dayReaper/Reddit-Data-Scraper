[Students in full-time programs at BCIT automatically have their courses registered for them.](https://commons.bcit.ca/news/2023/02/full-time-or-part-time-school/#:~:text=As%20a%20full%2Dtime%20student%20you%20are%20automatically%20registered%20into%20all%20the%20courses%20you%20need%20to%20complete%20your%20program%2C%20so%20you%20never%20have%20to%20worry%20about%20scheduling.%20You%20can%20focus%20completely%20on%20your%20studies%E2%80%94and%20entering%20the%20workforce%20when%20you%20graduate)\n\nIn my experience, you will eventually get a \"letter\" titled **Registered - Tuition Due** in your BCIT myCommunication that lets you know you can view your course schedule. This schedule can change so double check the schedule on the first day your program starts.\n\nIf you were taking the program part-time then you can choose the number of courses you want to take per term and you'd register for each course individually. (This typically turns out to be more expensive than just taking it full-time)",

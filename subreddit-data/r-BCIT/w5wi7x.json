I even reached out to my dep head and he said that it will update by the time the classes begin in September. I just wanna know if this is common or not?",

            "comment": "Speaking from experience, don\u2019t rely too much on the schedule you see online. It will update when your classes begin in September. Your first day will be an orientation day where you\u2019ll be told which set you\u2019re a part of and what the schedule is like for that particular set. That schedule will be uploaded on the learning hub which you\u2019ll be able to download on your mobile or laptop. You\u2019d always refer back to that schedule to see what classes you have for the day.",

Although during the COVID wave in January, the instructors started giving an option to students to come in to class or attend from home as they had their virtual classes running at the same time as well. \n\nMost of us would decide to stay at home on the days when it was just a lecture heavy day. I\u2019m guessing the instructors won\u2019t be doing the same this coming fall - since the program is listed as being delivered fully on campus. But, you never know what the instructors decide at the end of the day.",

I think our instructors had a challenging time to teach us in this new format. You\u2019ll be challenged to some degree in the first two terms. CISA is not like the other IT programs at BCIT like CIT where you\u2019ll be having sleepless nights. CISA is pretty straightforward. \n\nDo your homework, show up and pay attention in your class. If you do those things, you\u2019ll be graduating without any problems. Students who failed to graduate this program, did not do their assignments and didn\u2019t attend the classes. That\u2019s the bare minimum any student is expected to do at post secondary. \n\nWould I recommend it? If you\u2019re new to the world of IT and are looking to make a career out of it. I say yes, it\u2019s worth it since you can get a job at the end of the program or continue your studies to get a bachelors if you want. \n\nIf you\u2019re experienced, I\u2019d say pass on this program. You probably won\u2019t learn much from this but you will have that BCIT diploma if you stick to it and finish it. I know some students in my class had years of experience in IT and were super intelligent in the class but they needed a diploma to advance their careers.",

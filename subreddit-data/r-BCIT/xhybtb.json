Loving my current job so far!\n\nThat being said, if you want to try it, I recommend this if you really want. [https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0). But please don't let this be your decision maker. This is much harder than BCIT because any self-guided studying is much much much more difficult, frustrating and challenging than just guided studying like school.\n\nBut I found learning how to be decisive with uncertainty goes a long way for career and life in general. Most people including myself don't have any experience in coding when they join school and you are not going to be the only one who's uncertain if that helps.",

Let this be projects, interview prep, internship or whatever that may be. Many I know didn't end up getting CS related jobs. Unless you get lucky, no one is going to give you a job just because you have a diploma, you have to be the company's best candidate. \n\nIn comparison, sorry to say this but UBC/SFU will give you a better chance at getting a job or at least getting a better job after graduation. But if you are willing to make the best out of it, BCIT would a good choice since it's only 2 years and assuming you can get a solid job right after, you will be making money for 3 extra years while they are in school. Career growth COULD be more difficult for BCIT grads although my own story contradicts this.\n\nMy starting comp was around 50k. But I really want to stress that starting comp doesn't mean shit if you are making great career decisions. Think about the whole race, not the first step. For example, I have a friend who started 30% higher than me and started working 2 years earlier. Now I make 100k more than him.\n\nThat being said, aim for 70k+ if possible. Be ambitious!",

It doesn't and it doesn't even guarantee that you will get a CS job. I don't have faith in numbers BCIT gives you.\n\nYou have to pull your weight to outspeed their career and it's hard. Don't think you somehow \"hacked\" or \"outsmarted\" SFU/UBC students because it's shorter and cheaper. It's like you are in a race and you can start earlier, but you have heavy weights on your legs. It's just different advantages and disadvantages.\n\nCom-sci side of things, you will be behind in comparison to SFU/UBC grads. Naturally so as they study 4-5 years while you only do 2. And that's okay. In my personal experience, I found com-sci doesn\u2019t go so far in normal developer careers. In comparison to my coworkers, I have no clue because normal com-sci theories don't really come up in my work (other than DB/Algo but even that, you learn mostly at work). That being said, I have friend who's more in research type of work and I'd imagine it matters quite a bit for him. So it depends but imo, mostly doesn't matter.",

Going for it: sounds so obvious but many people don\u2019t even try or try then fail once and get too afraid to give it another try. My gf who\u2019s in another FANNG company kept my sprit going and that helped me a lot. I\u2019m luckily a naturally confident person, so great synergy with that.\n2. Being resourceful and prepared: Interview is all about being the best available candidate, when I prepared for the FAANG, I didn\u2019t just blindly study but instead I gathered all the available information there is on the internet and learned what they want to hear and wrote 20 notion pages myself and grind it for 3 weeks.\n3. Social skills: full disclosure, I\u2019m an introvert. If I talk to a person I\u2019ve never met for more than an hour and my social battery is out. But for some reason I learned to enjoy public speaking and presentations while at school. I believe that taught me how to figure out what the other side wants to hear and effectively communicate. I believe this skill is my sharpest tool. This helped me not only succeed at interviews but also be a better, effective coworker than those who can\u2019t communicate well. If you can\u2019t communicate in effective, respectful, pragmatic ways and you can\u2019t disagree with backbones, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to break in to FAANG or any other great positions.\n4. Continuously improve: I was a shitty student, failed a few courses even. But thankfully I figured out how important continuous improvement is in career and oh boy this mattered. Getting myself in a position so I learn meaningful stuff as I work, making sure I don\u2019t work outside working hours so I can improve my skills outside work and of course job hopping.",

And yes, I meant 4-5 yr SFU/UBC vs 2 yr BCIT.\n\nIn my honest opinion, 4-5 yrs in SFU/UBC would not fall behind \"hands-on\" experience. They will be ahead on both fronts. I think it's crazy to assume that BCIT can somehow teach  twice more effectively than SFU/UBC. Let's say SFU/UBC do fall behind in \"hands-on\", you would still have more than enough time to do interships and projects between semesters out of 4-5 years.\n\nBCIT's advantage is that you can possibly join workforce earlier and with great difficulty, you may outspeed their career by having more/better professional experience by the time they graduate.\n\nBut this ideal scenario is not common because getting a decent job after grad is more difficult than what BCIT grads expect. Let alone outspeeding SFU/UBC grads by the time they graduate.\n\nBut and again, although I haven't came across any BCIT grad in my office, LinkedIn says there are some so there must be some (I saw one that got into FAANG right after grad on LinkedIn). BCIT doesn't necessarily stop you from career growth as my own story shows but it has its disadvantages.",

I am an international student from South Korea who lived in the States for 10 years and am trying to decide whether to go to 2-year polytechnic college in Toronto (Seneca College) or BCIT, mainly because I heard Toronto has at least 5 times more jobs available for developers, however BCIT is overall better suited school for people like me who want to get into the tech field right after graduation.\n- lil bit about me: I have experience of learning little bit of in a 2-year college in the U.S. and web development coding bootcamp, from 4 years ago (entry level skill of HTML, CS, JS, Java)\n\nFor this reason, I have few questions:\n\n1. Do you think choosing a better school (BCIT) is more beneficial than going for the mediocre school in the more populated/tech-centered city (Toronto)?\n\n2. Do you think it's possible to move to Toronto and find a job as a junior developer once I have some experiences at small companies in Vancouver after graduation?\n\n3. Lastly and most importantly, do you think spending extra 2 years to get a bachelor\u2019s degree is worth it in the long run for developers compared to having 2 years of experience in small companies?\n\nsorry for asking too much, I am just curious about others' opinions, although I know I have to make decisions myself.",

As soon as you start your career, you steer the career. School doesn't spoon-feed or stop your career after you graduate.",

I am also in CST but am currently in the final semester at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. I saw what BCIT has to offer and there are tonnes of similarities. I once talked to a guy who graduated in the early 2000s and got into Yahoo but times have changed.   \nCan you send me a sample of your resume that helped you land your first job and the FAANG job? I want to see the formatting and what kind of information you provided + the projects you did as per the trends back then. I do not have many colleagues who feel the same way about employment after graduation, or so I feel. Most of them seem to be shooting small. As an international student, I am underwhelmed by it. I hope you still use Reddit, awaiting your reply :D",

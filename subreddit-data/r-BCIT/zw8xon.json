    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m currently in my last year of Highschool so applying to colleges and universities has been on my mind quite a lot. I really want to take the 3D modelling and animation course at BCIT. I have a few questions to ask.\n\nIn the application I also have to provide a portfolio of some of my work, are there any tips or things I should know to include in the portfolio? If you guys are willing to share examples of your portfolio I\u2019d love to see them!! I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing things right which would hopefully lead me to being accepted. \n\nHow easy is it to get accepted into that course? I know that the animation industry is pretty competitive in general but what are the chances of someone actually being accepted into that specific course? \n\nAnd for those who have already finished the course, were you able to find a job right away? Do you ever regret taking that course?",

You can search by keywords \u2018BCIT 3D modeling portfolio\u2019 in Artstation, there are lots of examples for you to ref.",

            "comment": "My portfolio contained about 4 or 5 scenes I had made in Blender. IIRC it was a landscape, a building, a donut and a simple screwdriver and screw animation. If you're looking to make something like that I'd recommend following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&amp;list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD).\n\nHowever they're not specifically looking for 3D art. Some of my classmates submitted drawings, architectural renderings, paintings, 2d animations, all sorts of stuff. You really just want to show that you've attempted some sort of artistic persuit and that you're really genuinely interested in this program.\n\nDon't get bogged down in demonstrating technical ability because that'll all be taught in the course. I thought I could model but I realised pretty fast how little I knew. Also with regards to the industry, you probably won't decide if you want to be a modeller, animator, rigger, etc. until 3 or 4 semesters in. \n\nIf you're still not sure you can e-mail Bob the program coordinator, he's very friendly and approachable.\n\nOtherwise DM me if you have any questions :)",

I was pretty worried that they would favour people with actual 3D artworks because I mainly only have 2D drawings, graphic designs and animations and every portfolio I\u2019ve seen had many 3D artworks. \n\nI\u2019ll definitely be checking out the tutorial and communicate if I have any more questions tho!!",

            "comment": "Hey so I recently got accepted into the January intake program for this year. From what my classmates told me, they aren\u2019t really mainly basing off of how good and skilled your portfolio looks but also the amount of effort that was put in to the portfolio. (Basically they want to see how much you want to end up in this course) \nSo as long your reasoning is pretty solid for joining into the program, you don\u2019t have to worry too too much about your portfolio.\n\nTo answer some questions, I applied very late into the program. Last year in August thats when I applied for the January intake of this year. It took about 2 solid weeks to get response from them and but I was sadly waitlisted for 2/half months.\n\nIt is pretty competitive to get a seating, most likely you will be waitlisted if you apply a little bit later than it was posted but overall you will definitely get a chance. :)",

Mainly most of them were pencil drawn showcasing shadow, perspective, and portraits. \n\nThey aren\u2019t picky at all when it comes to what you shown in the portfolios. Compared to me and my classmates, they have some very skilled, highly detailed drawings and animations they added into their portfolio. Made me feel very humbled but overall again, you really don\u2019t have to stress",

I finally mustered up the gumption to reach out today, but I'm still thinking about it and they don't open until tomorrow.  Just looking to talk about it and see how prominent this is here, anything you have to say about it is welcome really.",

They'll help out with tests and maybe getting notes for classes but I've found having a learning disability with bcit specifically in the trades programs to be absolute hell compared to other post secondary institutions",

I have official paperwork that says I have a diagnosis but not the actual diagnosis, I wonder if they're able to tell me where to find that sort of thing. Maybe my GP. I kind of just tried to ignore the whole thing for most of my education, so I have some things to scrape together now. \n\nThanks for your perspective",

That's basically it. Not the best institution I've found if you have a disability and during the pandemic they were absolute dog shit",

    "postText": "I am currently in a non competitive business program. I really struggled my first term, and my average was 61%. This second term, my average is at 80%. \n\nThe issue is that in order to go to second year, you need a minimum average of 72%. I\u2019m guessing that i\u2019ll end up with an average of around 70%. Now i\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to make my second year of my diploma. \n\nDo you think they\u2019ll let me go into second year, even if i\u2019m a little bit under the average?",

            "comment": "Hi,\nThe quick answer is, it depends. If you got a 70% average and it\u2019s because you failed a prerequisite or two (presumably while also passing other courses with high grades) you may get a letter from your program laying out what you need to do to complete and saying you cannot continue unless the missing elements are completed. It\u2019s possible, if there is hot competition for your favoured option, that they may take the students with the highest averages first. \n\nHowever, my suspicion is that, with a solid second term, you should be fine. You should talk to your PH; it\u2019s always a good idea to keep the lines of communication open, especially if you can write a decent, polite email. However, they will likely tell you, at this stage, that the die is cast. After the marks meetings, grades get confirmed, based on course achievements. At that point, whatever happens, you may be able to push for a decision in your favour on acceptance in an option. Again, write clear, polite emails that don\u2019t show a sense of entitlement. Show ownership of the issues, show determination, and show consistent intention.",

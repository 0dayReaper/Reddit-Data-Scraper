You could take classes for both courses in the same term, but would have to wait to declare one until you\u2019d finished the other.",

A lot of programs overlap and bridge so it's worth looking at what courses are required for both and see if you can do some electives that count for both.",

In addition, signing up for classes is no longer easy as usually you have to make at least one call to the department head per term.\nIt might be easier if the courses fall under the same school. Also double booking for courses is frequently an issue.",

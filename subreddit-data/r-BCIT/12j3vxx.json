    "postText": "I got accepted into BCIT CST (Computer Systems Technology).  \nI decided to pay the commission fee of 500$ a bit too late. It is due by April 11 2023 and I paid on April 10 at 3pm. I did not know that it took a delay of 48 hours. Does this mean my application might be denied. If so do I have to apply again? Do I get the 500$ back?",

I wouldn't be too concerned as I haven't heard of anyone having issues if they paid on/before the deadline (it has been asked a few times in this subreddit). \n\nFor some peace of mind, give Student Information and Enrolment Services a call tomorrow at 604-434-1610 or your admissions officer (their number is located at the bottom of the \"Accept\" letter in your BCIT myCommunication. You can still send an email but I find it can take a few days to get a response for emails.",

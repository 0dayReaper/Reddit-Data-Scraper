Our brains can trick us into believing that people don't care about us, or that it doesn't matter if people care about us at all, but it isn't true. It matters that people care about you. \n\nI don't know your situation, but it's easy to get consumed by school when you're in it. If it is literally taking your life force, it is definitely worth taking some time off and nurturing yourself/doing a different thing that doesn't make you feel like this.\n\nAlso, BCIT offers counselling to students (which maybe you already know) https://www.bcit.ca/counselling/\n\nSending you some energy \ud83d\udc93 you can get through this.",

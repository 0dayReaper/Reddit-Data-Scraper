    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI was going through BCIT's site and came across the Jet Engine Technician certificate. I am quite interested in this program; I've always marvelled (and yet feared) jet engines. Kind of an odd career for someone with a fear of flying but I just love planes and airports. I also enjoy working with my hands.\n\nI've been working in IT the last 10 years, but I absolutely hate being in an office, it's driving me crazy. I'm just tired of it, not to mention the 24/7 on-call rotations. Not sure if age matters, but I am 36 - were there older students in your cohort?\n\nI was wondering if anyone could chime in on their experience in the program? How was it, were you able to find a job, and what is the working environment/colleagues like? Is there lots of strict deadlines/pressure? Is the pay decent?\n\nI don't care too much about salary but more curious about what the working environments are like. I come from a background in office politics, although that's everywhere I'd kinda like something I can just *work* at.",

It took me 9 months at the time to find a job then due to there being...no jobs, but right now most aviation places are desperate and hiring.\n\nIf you become a turbine technician and work in overhaul, you will most likely work standard hours Monday to Friday. If you become an AME, you will work graveyards or shift work in most cases. Pay for either direction is similar to start, but a licensed and endorsed AME will earn substantially more than someone working in overhaul after a few years, depending where you work.\n\nFyi, a turbine tech will be overhauling jet engines in a shop, while an AME will be working on live aircraft.\n\nI don't see 36 being an issue. There were quite a few older students in my class, and now, I still see people entering the field at a later age.\n\nPay in Canadian aviation is not the greatest, but it isn't the worst. Starting positions will be $20-25 an hour which sucks. Not sure on overhaul guys, but experienced, licensed and endorsed AMEs will top out around $50 an hour, give or take a couple bucks, with opportunities for overtime.",

If you can't take pressure, it's not a great career to choose. I wouldn't say it's any more toxic than any other workplace, but there's dipshits in every industry. Don't be an asshole, be humble, listen, and learn from mistakes and you'll get along fine.",

Is it a simple interview or will we also be quizzed on medical knowledge? \n\nAlso I\u2019ve heard that not a lot of highschool students get in and that they prefer people with post secondary experience, is that true? My highschool graduating ceremony is literally tomorrow lol!",

I'm trying to gather information as well but it's hard because the online interview is a new thing.\n\nSeems like it should not ask science specific questions but if they do it will be simple cell labeling and some chemistry conversions (how to do do a dilution or convert from moles to grams).\n\nFrom what I understand the questions are designed to see your ethics, reasoning, hearing acuity, color/shape identification, and possibly other standard interview type questions (what is your intent?).\n\nLet me know if you find out any details because the practice MMI questions online are geared towards med school students and the questions are beyond the scope of what they should be asking us.\n\nP.S. you should be able to see your Casper result on the website, they report it as a % of the top, for example mine just said you scored in the top 75-100% which is a pretty wide margin.",

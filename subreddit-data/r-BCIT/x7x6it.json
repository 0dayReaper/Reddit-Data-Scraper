            "comment": "You can do anything really, but you have to work for it.  Getting into coop is a good start and then see what you like to focus on.  From my term the 10 people I drink beer with are mostly SDE/devops, one guy is an IT security manager.  Full stack/front end quite common in our group, react is used a lot.  I chose c++ and Java so I had to study on my own a bit.  \n\nThe coding they teach in class is not enough to get you a SDE role, so if that's what you want to do then Leetcode and cracking the coding interview are your friends.\n\nYou have a lot more free time compared to CST students, which is both good and bad.  Good is you can prioritize what you want to learn.  Bad in that it's too easy to just spend time on movies, Netflix, games, etc.",

The second one is mostly for PTS.\n\nBut both have full-time and PTS students in the CST. I would suggest you join up both.\n\nAlso PTS Computing club are currently diverse with different programs in the computing dept.",

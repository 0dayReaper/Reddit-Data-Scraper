I've been told that this job is good for burnaby/Vancouver area and the demand is good but I got some qustions about the courses itself.\n\nIs the program hard and straightforward? Will finding work be possible right after graduating with a diploma?\n\nIs diploma the best route for Hvac?\nWhat's the difference between apprenticeship, certificate, diploma and which one is better?\n\nSorry if I'm asking too many things it's just that graduation is near for me and thank you for your time.",

I took a course there and while on work experience my teacher quit and didn't log any grades so the school refused to give my whole class diplomas, which means they stole our money.  The teachers do the course and then take a 1 week class to teach so that's what you get to work with.  \n\nYou would be better off calling a union and applying for an apprenticeship through them. Probably cost you the same amount of money too and you'll have a job.",

You will learn about literally anything related to engineering/mining/pulp technology with having 7\\~8 courses per semester. Every day class starts at 8:30 and ends around 2:30 to 5:30 depends on the day. Typical day would have 2\\~3 1 hour classes with 1\\~2 labs each takes 2\\~3 hours.  \n\n\nTLDR: Courseload is insane, be prepared to learn literally anything",

            "comment": "Recent(ish) CENV graduate here. I can echo some of what Mariners11409 has said but have some different perspectives as well. \n\nWhile it is true that you have classes that start at 8:30 and end between 2:30 \u2013 5:30 every weekday I never found the workload to be too overwhelming, most of the time. That said, you will need to learn how to manage your time and be willing to sacrifice some of your social life while in the program. This isn\u2019t unique to the CENV program but applies to BCIT as a whole. \n\nPersonally, I found 4th term to be one of the easiest terms. Your graduation project is done that term, so you\u2019re given more free time to use towards it, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be. That will just have to be a discussion between you and your project group members. \n\nFor me, terms 2 and 3 were the most difficult. Term 2 will have you taking Organic Chemistry I, Differential Calculus, and Chemical Engineering Basics at the same time. These are difficult courses on their own, but together they can feel overwhelming. The difference in difficulty between Terms 1 and 2 is the steepest and caught me off guard. \n\nTerm 3 isn\u2019t too bad when it comes to course difficulty. The challenging part of this term is that there\u2019s a lot of content to cover in a relatively short period of time. By mid-October I was having 1 \u2013 2 midterms a week until finals week in December. You won\u2019t be having a lot of free time this term.\n\nI was in the analytical stream, Mariners seems to be in the process engineering stream from the courses they're mentioning, so that may explain our different experiences.",

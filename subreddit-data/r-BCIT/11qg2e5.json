            "comment": "Hope you're feeling better! Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way around getting a refund if you missed the deadline. BCIT recommends that you contact your instructor or program head if you are missing classes due to Covid, so you can find a way to accommodate missed classes or studying. They also offer a program called Early Assist which is supposedly there to help you for these scenarios\n\nYou can check with Student Information on the main phone line and speak with them. They might be able to point you in the right direction for an appeal sort of thing but not sure myself.\n\nBest of luck! Hope it works out for you.",

It is worth mentioning that all these cases boil down to what is said in the policy. Policy is the law. If you didn't follow the policy, you lose, if they didn't - they lose.",

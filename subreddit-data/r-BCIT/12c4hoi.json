    "postText": "I was planning on starting ASD as flex education this May but the section of COMP 1516 I was registered in has been cancelled twice already. I work full time so it's quite frustrating to plan the time commitment to take a course to have it cancelled and your available options dwindle. This also has me concerned of whether or not this will be an on-going issue for all future courses.",

            "comment": "There's not much you can do about it, it can happen if there aren't enough students enrolled or probably when they can't find someone to teach it. IMO they have an excessive amount of offerings for COMP 1516 so I'm not surprised some were cancelled. \n\nYou shouldn't encounter too many issues with the CST courses as it is a relatively popular program so the likelihood of cancellations are lower and at the very least there are other offerings available (some courses in other programs have a single offering that ends up being cancelled). If switching to a different offering is problematic for you, I suggest contacting the program assistants to see if they have any insight on the matter.\n\nNote you will want to plan for the *availability* of courses as some courses are only available at certain times of the year (i.e. COMP 2825 is only available in Jan and May) and they might be a pre-requisite for other courses.",

            "comment": "PTS is kind of a crapshoot on course availability and scheduling. It heavily depends on the number of students signed up for the course. They'll drop it if there aren't enough. This isn't common in early program courses (ASD and ACIS should generally be fine, you had bad luck most likely.) but beyond that it starts to be an issue. As does them scheduling courses in a conflicting way so you can't actually take 2 courses simultaneously because you can't be in two places at once.\n\nYou should be fine, a little bad luck aside, doing ASD as PTS. If you do end up pursuing the laddering path, bear that in mind though. Personally, I gave up on PTS, quit my job, and switched to FTS eventually.",

I'll be working part-time and I'm thinking of taking 5 classes since a full-time program is 9 (I think). Would you say the workload for 5 courses in a term at BCIT is about the same as 5 courses at UBC?",

BCIT workload per course is a lot, and they stack a lot of courses on you. That last part is really no joke, it gets slung around a lot, but engineering students are taking from 7-9 courses per term with weekly quizzes and weekly sizeable assignments in almost every course.",

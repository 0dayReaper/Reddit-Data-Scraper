If you take this, you will have to specialize in your second year in either communications, tourism, professional sales, real estate or entrepreneurship. Depending on what specialization you want to do, it\u2019s decided by your GPA in year one of marketing management, so it becomes competitive entry to get into year 2 specializations. Some are going to be more competitive than others, such as marketing communications and maybe even real estate. Having a certificate beforehand will help before hand. If the courses overlap, you will have a reduced course load as well. Part time courses are more expensive though so keep that in mind. Full time would be a bit cheaper",

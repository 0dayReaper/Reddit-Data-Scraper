What are you hoping to do afterwards? You mention something in business, but what exactly? I ask because you might be better suited in one of the other ones.",

If so, then maybe a business management option would help your career.... or if you plan to own a business, but normally people who start a business have a specialty or trained skill in something else, like cooking, mechanics, engineering, construction, interior design, software development, etc... and they may benefit from have basic businesses management skills since they do not know how to run a business efficiently. You could buy a business or become a franchise owner, but I'm not sure if that's what you intend.\n\n Also, job prospects, nobody is looking to hire a manager upon graduating from a 2 year business management program. The job market afterwards may be rough. The truth is, you'll have to work in sales or data entry, or something basic and eventually work up to a manager. The diploma may help get you there a little bit quicker, but it's a long way to the top... unless you have like at least 5 years experience in a mid-level management position such as a supervisor. My suggestion is specialize in a business stream, Operations Management is good and you'll be employable in top industries, marketing is fun but if you hate sales you may not like the early days after graduating, HR and Accounting can be a bit boring from what I've heard, but tbh any job will eventually bore you. If you specialize you'll have more options to fall on, because the fact of the matter is generic business jobs will be offered to almost anyone, especially those from any business program... so might as well get a specialization if the job prospects will be essentially the same....",

As for this program or other schools, I mean it really depends what kind of school experience you want. I think the other colleges/universities offer good business management programs too. BCIT is just a VERY different set up from other schools.",

For math, you only need grade 11 math level. When I was in the accounting program, I found myself having trouble with reading the tax act because I did not understand its English at all, and I could not find the right information I needed.  And accounting requires a lot of readings!  I chose accounting because I was an English second language speaker. I thought I was good at math so I could do well on the accounting program, but I was wrong.",

Best decision I could have ever made.\n\nI had almost the same intentions as you when I first came to BCIT. As such, i got my diploma in the marketing management E-Ship option which honestly gives you the basis for everything you need to know to open your own company.\n\nI also decided to go for the BBA as it would get me access to better jobs if i decided I no longer wanted to pursue creating my own company. I ended up getting a job out of school rather than starting my own business. Although I would love to start my own company one day still, its would rough leaving a 6 figure job at 24 years old \ud83d\ude05\n\nFor reference the Marketing Management programs go directly into the BBA if you want, but it is competitive to get into and requires a 70% average grade across the entire diploma as well as a 70% average grade in 5 core classes (Statistics, Essentials of Marketing, Accounting, Business Communication, and Micro Economics).",

Just so much more u can do with it such as the Entrepreneurship option, Professional Sales option, Marketing Communications option, or the Tourism Management option while Business Management is just kind of a general business program. Both diploma options lead to the BBA though.",

    "postText": "Hi, just hoping I can get tips on the MLS program. I'm starting this Sept, and I feel like I'm not ready yet. Any tips on how to get ready for this program? Should I buy books already? And what are the essentials going into the program? Is the schedule on the myBcit account accurate or is there a more accurate schedule I should check?\n\nAlso, is it easy to find class rooms in BCIT? It'll be my first time studying here in Canada, I'm honestly unfamiliar with schools here. Any help would be much appreciated!",

Do not worry, everything will be fine. :) You will get oriented in your first week.\n\nDon't buy books yet \u2013 most of them are available for free online in PDF and are not super necessary.\n\nThe detailed schedule can be found by going to https://learn.bcit.ca/\n\nFind \"Med Lab Central - Medical Laboratory Science - CoP (manual)\" \u2014&gt; \"Content\" \u2014&gt; \"Program Schedules\" \u2014&gt; \"MLS Fall 2022 Level 1 schedule_Aug 11\"\n\nYou will be given a tour of campus so that you can find your classes. Instructors will be patient while you are learning to find your way around. You are not alone, everybody else in your class will also be feeling lost for the first few days. It's natural. :)\n\nTake some deep breaths and enjoy your last week before the program starts! Don't you dare start studying yet, you will have plenty of time to do so after this week. :)\n\nCongratulations on being admitted into the program!",

            "comment": "First, a general misconception is that finishing CST will land you a job. You also need to be proactive in improving your skills.\n\nSeveral general tips:\n\nYou need to make your own projects. Focus on a tech stack. Have someone look over your resume (most likely it is unappealing). Go to job fairs.\n\nPersonally, I would not do the BTech. It is up to you though. It could be a good idea to do further schooling during this recession.  \n\n\nEdit: Oops, I saw in your post history that you went into BCIT Marketing Management. I thought you graduated CST (or maybe you did; it's hard to tell). If you're planning to switch to CST, I highly recommend it :)",

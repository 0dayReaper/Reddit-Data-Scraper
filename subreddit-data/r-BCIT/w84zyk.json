    "postText": "Hello, I'm planning to apply to Software Systems Developer program next year. \n\nWhile checking the entrance requirements, I found that I needed to take COMP1516 or other 3 credits of post-secondary object-oriented programming from a recognized institution. \n\nI can take COMP1516 this year before applying to SSD program, but it seems like I need to complete COMP1002 first to take COMP1516 which is a prerequisite. Does that mean I need to take COMP1002 first and then I can take COMP1516 later? Is there any other equivalent courses to COMP1516 which doesn't require prerequisites? I don't think I can complete both courses before applying to SSD, which also costs me quite a lot money.\n\nThank you in advance!",

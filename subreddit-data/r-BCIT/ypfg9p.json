SFU CS writes code in week 2 of the first semester unless the student is taking 3 courses per term (which far too many students do) and doesn't take CS right away. \n\nDefinitely the amount of CS courses taken per term at SFU is nothing compared to BCIT. There are pros and cons to each program, but I think it's a stretch and just not true to say \"nothing but math and theory and architecture for years before they ever wrote any code.\"",

It used to be a 24 hour period which I could time to cover the afternoon classes one day and morning the next. Even worse for part time students who come from 6-9pm and pay the same rate as students parking all day.",

They\u2019ll eventually start sending letters and calling from \u201ccity collection company\u201d (which is actually owned by impark) to try and spook you into paying them. I called their bluff and sent them a letter urging them to take the matter to court if they believe a legally valid debt exists and to stop contacting me otherwise. Never heard anything from them after that lol",

Especially with duolingo? I'm applying with my duolingo english test results.\n\nI need you guys' help..lol",

The best way to find it out is to set up a zoom meet with the admission or physically go to the campus during visiting hours, they kinda host a 1on1 Q&amp;A regarding any program related questions, you can check it out on the website",

Yea, since it\u2019s competitive entry and has a limited quota it really depends on peers, which is a bit pain lol. Yea, also since bcit doesn\u2019t give conversion of English scores above the certain level so it\u2019s hard to estimate how the percentage is calculated above those certain grades so it really helps you just replied with the exact duolingo scores and math scores.",

    "postText": "TL;DR is at the bottom.\n\nHello guys, I have a some questions about the Food Technology and Financial Planning diplomas at BCIT.\n\nMy husband loves cooking at home and  has their Red Seal in culinary with 5 years of kitchen experience, but wants a carreer change.\n\n He is looking for something less stressful, higher wage, job security, normal office  schedule, more fulfilment, and not having to cook all the time. \n\nHe is also really good at math (graduated highschool with a grade of 99%, damn, right?) and is interested to learn trading and stock market and all that, but he just  doesn't have the time with his job schedule.\n\nHe is considering Food Technology because he feels that he already spent so much time in the food industry, so he doesn't want that time spent to go to waste. (He also enjoys cooking at home for fun, just not at restaurants). If he goes into food technnology, he would most likely try to get a job at a brewery.\n\nWith that being said,\n\nIf you took either Food Technology or Financial Planning at BCIT (or elsewhere), I would appreciate it if you put your personal input to answer the following questions realistically and hopefully it can help him make a decision.\n\nHere are the questions:\nBefore answering the questions, please state which diploma you took:)\n\n1.) Does your career offer you job security, livable wage, and good hours? (if you can also share your job position that would be great)\n\n2.) What kind of entry jobs are realistically  available right out of graduation, and what is the salary?\n\n3.) What is the most common job position with either of these diplomas, and what is the salary?\n\n4.) What are the most desirable job possitions in this career, how long does it usually take to get there, and what is the wage/ salary?\n\n5.) What is something you hate about your job, and something you love?\n\n6.) Are there times where you wish you went into a different career? If so, why?\n\n7.) Which diploma do you think he should take, and why?\n\nI hope the questions are not too confusing or demanding, but my husband really wants to get out of kitchens and your answers will really help him make a decision:)\n\nTL;DR\nMy husband wants a career change from working in  kitchens for 5 years, is considering Food Technology or Financial Planning Diplomas. Questions for you are above:)\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Hello, \n\nI'm currently a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) who works at a local credit union. \nMy current role is a senior advisory role, which is more of a jack of all trades that does mortgage lending, investments and regular banking. \n\nIv been in the process of interviewing at various banks to get insight on a true Financial Planning role.\n\nTo be a Financial planner, you'll need the certification. There are two main routes, the PFP offered through Canadian Securities Institute and the CFP through FP Canada which is the higher quality certification. \n\nTo be a CFP you'll need 3 years of work experience ([CFP work experience](https://www.fpcanada.ca/students-and-candidates/work-experience)) but the preliminary QAFP designation only requires 1 year. \n\nAs for salary, going in without banking experience I would expect $50,000 - $65,000 to start and likely in a financial advisor role while you learn the ropes.\n\nIn my experience, I have gone from $45,000 in a junior advisor role, to about $85,000 after about 3-4 years. My role now has a bonus structure that can add $10,000 - $25,000 a year. \n\nAs for financial planning roles at banks, there will be a significant portion of your annual income that is based on variable compensation/ bonuses and potentially direct commission based on assets under management. \nWith Scotia, the starting salary is between 70-80k with a potential bonus of 0-100k+ that is based on annual goals. \nWith RBC and TD, there is a variable compensation that is based on the assets you manage and relationships you build.  Both start around 65-80k for salary but can earn well above 100k especially as you grow your \"book\".\n\nUnfortunately it'll be hard to jump right from schooling into a higher paying position, you'll need experience first. \n\nAs for your specific questions\n1 - From what iv seen, good talent is hard to come by so if you're good with people you should have great job security.  Most banks have a 37.5 hour work week, and many FP positions can work from home 1 - 2 days a week if you want. \n\n2 &amp; 3- realistic entry would be an advisory role around 50k, but with experience and a FP designation that will increase to 80-100k after a few years. Seasoned financial planners can earn upwards of 200k fairly easily, with upwards of 500k/yr if you can go into private wealth or have your own business. \n\n4 - ideally you'll want to have a \"financial planner\" role and move away from the basic advisory side. The private wealth side would be the most lucrative. \n\n5 - I love the flexibility to manage my own time, but in my current role a slow branch is mind numbing at times. \n\n6 - no, I'm quite happy with this career and even more so with the future prospects.\n\n7 - I'm heavily biased, but my vote goes for financial planning. \n\nI would be happy to answer any more questions you have!",

    "postText": "Personalized short documentary and a cup of Starbucks coffee for FREE!\n\nHello I\u2019m a student from BCIT dt campus, currently taking video storytelling class with Stephen. We\u2019re doing a short documentary (about 2-6 mins) for anyone that has a good story to tell and is willing to show in front of the camera. This documentary can be utilized as your portfolio if you\u2019re looking for a job and wish to present yourself to the employers.\n\nThere are two sections for the shooting, firstly we\u2019ll have a chat with you and ask you some questions (the questions will be provided before the interview so that you can have a sense of what we\u2019re going to talk about). The second part will be a b-roll shooting, which will be the background scenes/components of your story. For example if you\u2019re a cook, then maybe we can shoot the process you cook; or if you\u2019re a guitarist, then we can shoot on the side while you\u2019re playing guitar.\n\nWe know everyone is busy, so for any volunteer, in addition to the final short documentary, we also provide a cup of Starbucks coffee. We also welcome anyone that\u2019s not from BCIT so if you happen to know anyone that could be a good fit for this shoot please comment down below or shoot me a message! We\u2019re beyond grateful! Thank you.\n\n* **Theme**: any good story you want to share about yourself or the organization\n* **Format**: short documentary (about 2-6 mins)\n* **Shooting time**: Nov. 2- Nov. 14 (anytime you say as long as we don\u2019t have class then)\n* **Shooting duration**: 1.5-2hrs (including interview and b-roll)\n* **Location**: BCIT or where you feel the best to demo your story or skill (we\u2019re flexible and let\u2019s figure this out later)\n* **Reference** (these vids aren't made by us): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QFaI4Hn6o;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QFaI4Hn6o) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNl400OegE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNl400OegE8)\n* **What can you get**:\n   * A personalized documentary(we\u2019ll edit the footage into two versions, and you can get both of them if you want!)\n   * This documentary can be utilized as your portfolio if you\u2019re looking for a job and wish to present yourself to the employers\n   * A cup of Starbucks\n* **How to reach me**: Comment down below or DM me!

    "postText": "Hello! I am interested in getting into the web development field and was wondering if anybody here has taken the AWD Associate Certificate program at BCIT. Unfortunately I can only do part time studies for the foreseeable future. Would this program help to land me an entry level position? Would really appreciate everyone\u2019s advice. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",

You'd still need to have a killer portfolio + industry connection + your past background since web dev is over saturated. Unfortunately,  breaking into web dev is the hardest part.",

You'll likely be competing against BCIT CST diploma and degree grads and SFU/UBC CS grads for the same entry level jobs.\n\nMake sure to work on a portfolio of personal projects, network with people to gain industry connections, set up a solid LinkedIn profile, etc.",

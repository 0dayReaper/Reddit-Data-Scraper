It does stress me out a bit being in a confined room with other who aren't masked. \n\nWhat if a student gets covid? Do they just have to not attend class for 2 weeks? I feel that with BCIT's workload, that would be challenging for a student who misses 2 weeks worth of labs/lectures.",

Like after you graduate you're gonna go out to work right? I assume people at your job site are gonna be unmasked or unvaccinated. Getting to campus you're probably gonna take transit \nwith unmasked and unvaccinated people (unless you're fortunate enough to afford a car). \n\nAs for what BCIT is doing, my understanding is that they're scrapping big lectures. Lectures will be held online while labs are in person with your set. This limits the number of people you're exposed to to about 30. Obviously this is program specific so you need to either tell us what you're taking or contact the program area directly.",

They are working on a vaccine for under 12 yr olds by eoy which would be great, but I still have to be careful. \n\nYou are right though, I'll need to figure it out when I'm looking for work unless I find something remote. \n\nScrapping big lectures helps I guess, with cases going up so quickly I wonder if Dr. Henry will mandate masks again.",

If there were some hardcore anti-maskers they should be in groups together and have students with masks in other groups so everyone is as comfortable as possible.\n\nI suspect many profs will be asking students to hold the line (hold the wall!) for everyone\u2019s safety.",

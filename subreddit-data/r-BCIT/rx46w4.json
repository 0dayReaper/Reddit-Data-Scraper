Don't know why BCIT wants to rush this progress compare to some other post-secondary institutions in BC. Does anyone want to share their thoughts on this matter?",

Makes 0 sense to force students to expose in person contact to watch videos in class. I jus dun get how 2 years into this they still have these poorly thought out plans. \n\nRemote the classes that don\u2019t require in person and provide in person learning to those areas of studies that REQUIRE in person like trades or hands on practices. There is literally 0 logic in making in person for everyone during this spike of omicron. \n\nI get people say they are less motivated learning online but hate to burst your bubbles but guess what your not k-12 anymore you\u2019re  adults and should learn to motivate yourself when it comes to learning. Not getting infected by omicron isn\u2019t a choice for everyone motivation is your own choice. I\u2019m working remotely right now and if I told my boss that I couldn\u2019t do my job cause I don\u2019t feel motivated I really doubt I would still have a job. There\u2019s a reason why mine including many of my friends employers have kept on doing WFH( work from home). Safety should Vito preference In these critical times where people can actually die or cause their loved ones to get sick. \n\nNothing needs to be 100% remote and nothing needs to be 100% in person, all it really needs is some more common sense, put in person essential classes in person and non in person essential classes remote end of story. Doesn\u2019t require more staff or funding just better management. and thank you to whoever started the petition. Looks like it\u2019s getting some attention at least https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/bcit-petition-delayed-return-in-person-classes It\u2019s really sad to see that Reddit is the only platform students can rely on and not their own educational institutes in these dire times. \n\nHonestly I feel bad for people who are still at school. Education institutes shouldn\u2019t be like this when people are paying thousands of dollars per term for their education and safety. Remote learning doesn\u2019t suck because it\u2019s remote. It\u2019s because of the quality of that instructor teaching it. Look at Jeffrey Yim and Rahul (forgot last name) from CST those 2 created a python curriculum from scratch and pretty much everyone loved it even tho majority of it was online. A good teacher can teach good quality education in any environment. Sadly I think Rahul doesn\u2019t teach python anymore tho I think he went on to a bigger role or something.",

If PHO was so reliable our infection rates wouldn\u2019t be at record breaking levels 2 years into the pandemic. If The core reasons are related to cash and funding like many people have previously mentioned then for sure BCIT gives zero fcks about students safety. Also very funny how BCIT stated in one of their messages that delaying in person return till Jan 10th was a proactive decision one day after PHO announces k-12 delays. this management will try their hardest to sneak in a tiny bit of credit to themselves anytime possible instead of actually doing their jobs. Whelp regardless that petition going around is picking up some steam so wish you all the best of luck everyone",

With well over 3000 cases per day and being in a cramped computer laboratory with 30 other kids, sitting literally a foot away from people who choose not to be vaccinated at all that are constantly removing their masks in class - does this make any sense at all BCIT? Wake up and see what is going on here. The last couple weeks of class in the previous semester, the grounds keepers/ janitorial staff couldn\u2019t even be bothered to refill sanitation solution at the hand pumps for literally TWO WEEKS in one of the buildings we did our exams in. I totally disagree with this decision to return to in class, I have already emailed my department head about an issue unrelated to this over a week ago and have not received a response from him. I will definitely be emailing him and the student association regarding my feelings on this but I absolutely do not expect a response considering how this place of \u201chigher learning\u201d has been operating this past year. DO THE COURSES ONLINE, it\u2019s a bloody computer networking program for crying out loud. This stuff is done remotely for the most part anyways - good experience for how things will be once we are on the job. For other programs that are more hands on trades maybe a different situation, but let\u2019s have some common sense here.",

At the same time, BCIT cannot force us to record or stream our classes. Can a student stream/record it for another student? Up to the instructor.   \n\n\nI could be wrong about the above, but I have a reasonable grasp on the policies , I hope :-)",

My point about her was that you not knowing who she was clearly indicated that you are not at all informed on what is going on politically, socially, or scientifically throughout this pandemic. \n\nThings aren\u2019t easy for anyone right now, but to compare the consequences of people with disabilities that make COVID a death sentence to people with neurodivergent disabilities (I happen to fall in this category as well) is absurd. To compare the risk of failing school with the risk of death and permanent disability is also absurd. The fact that you are healthy enough not to fear death by going to school in person IS privilege in itself. The fact that you have access to post secondary education and are even having this conversation IS privilege in itself. \n\nThe decision to push students to in person classes is a decision being made for the entire population, not just people affiliated with BCIT or post secondary schools.

            "comment": "The problem for BCIT is they cannot make decision. I would not say it is good or bad decision as you know online learning really destroy the learning environment for most of the students and their prospects after graduated which will also give a negative image to BCIT.\n\nBut the point is BCIT always hesitate, that's kinda weird. online/in-person teaching, 1 or 2, just pick one but don't wait for last minute. no matter what decision BCIT makes, there must be some controversies that is inevitable. At least, BCIT shows what they as a 'BCIT' such a big and good reputation school at BC does.\n\nfor trades, nursing and other programs, they definitely need to learn via in-class teaching, you can't learning anything by just sitting in front of the computer, besides,  it won't be good for our mental health if keeping ourselves at home for online-learning all the time.",

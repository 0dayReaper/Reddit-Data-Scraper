            "comment": "2022 Graduate here. Don't currently have a job but a few of my classmates are already hired right after their practicum aka internship.\n\nThe difficulty is about what you'd expect from any other BCIT program. You'll be spending a lot of your off hours working projects in small teams. You'll have tests to study for as well, but I was spending way more time working with my team to meet checkpoints/deadlines. \n\nD3 is nice if you're interested in the design/development career space but unsure of what you want to focus on. It'll give you a great opportunity to learn and practice skills in graphic design, UI/UX, and front/back-end development (more front-end than back-end). \n\nMy classmates ended up in a variety of different fields, including marketing, UI/UX design/development, web/mobile, etc. For me personally, I'm looking for a front-end development position as that's where I put most of my time into during the program and my practicum.\n\nI'm sure older graduates can chime in on their experiences but I overall had a positive experience with the program. There are some classes that were borderline useless (accounting, law,) but I know the program is going under a rework so it'll be exciting to see how that pans out.",

I too am more interested in the front-end development career but this program\u2019s diverse range of courses really appealed to me as well! Did you find that the less related courses (accounting) was distracting when wanting to learn the front end dev aspects? Did you feel the front end dev courses were robust enough?\n\nAh yes! I\u2019m excited to see what the reworking of the courses will be !!! Hopefully lessening the unrelated courses haha",

Sales and marketing were interesting in that they do have some relation to how you can design something, while law was semi-relevant in terms of learning how to properly manage trademarks and copyrights. Accounting was just throwaway and from what I've heard from the year below us, they're getting rid of it so you don't have to worry about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe front-end courses we're great. They really drilled in on how to style properly since you'll be doing the designing and developing. However, as a design-heavy course, you'll find the logic part of front-end development lacking. We did look into filters, sorting, and arrays in the latter half of the program, but it was just a scratch of what you would look into in a computer science program. It was definitely enough to prepare me for my practicum though.",

This is definitely reassuring to hear in regards to the marketing, sales and law classes! Great that they all have some sort of relation. \n\nOh wow I\u2019m super excited about the front end dev courses now hearing all this! So good to learn about effective styling! Thank you so much again for all this info. I\u2019ll be sure to apply right when the app opens for the 2023 intake haha",

I was wondering if I need to apply to the school myself in December-February for the internship and wait for an interview or will BCIT assign it?",

What I mean by that is, during your 4th semester, you're going to be actively looking for an opportunity to find a practicum opportunity while taking classes. Your classes will end early, around mid-late March, and your practicum will start from there. Whether you start right as your classes end or take a week or two to find a practicum opportunity, you'll need to complete a minimum amount of hours to complete the practicum and get the credits to graduate. For me that was 240 hours. \n\nDuring my search, the instructor would put up several internship opportunities directly on the class forum to apply for, ranging from graphic designers, UI/UX designers/devs, to front-end jobs. These will usually be easy to get into, you'll just be competing with your fellow classmates. You can definitely look into finding a real job as your practicum, or an internship opportunity during that time, but few people found success finding one in time. If you find yourself unable to find one by the deadline, the instructor will help you by connecting with other companies and seeing if they can find you an opportunity. \n\nTLDR: It's on you to find a practicum for that time period in order to graduate. The instructor might give you some opportunities but they usually won't fill the entire program's needs, having others find opportunities outside of the instructors job opportunities. \n\nFor your example, front-end developers jobs are definitely abundant and I'm sure you'll find an opportunity to practice it in the workforce during that time. Just make sure to apply early. I personally didn't start applying seriously until the last month and ended up getting into a random company from the posted job opportunities last second.",

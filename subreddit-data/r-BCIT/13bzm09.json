    "postText": "I've applied to the program for Sept intake. The application deadline is May 28; if I don't get in, I will probably not be able to apply to another program because other programs already closed their application cycle. I don't want to wait for another year. So, I'd like to ask, for 2nd and 3rd year radiation therapy students, what GPA did you get in? Casper score? \n\nI am not sure if I should wait until May 28, or I should cancel my application and accept offer from another university. Please help.",

I recommend waiting if you are interested in the radiation therapy field. GPA wise if you are getting above 80% for all the pre-requisites you should be in a good position.",

I am within the top 10 on the waitlist and wanted to know the chances of getting accepted into the program. I was told wait times could be between now and first week of class in September. What are the key dates students drop out or decide not to accept their offers? Is there anything else I can do while I wait? I am kinda lost and don't know what to do.",

Working while waiting for the program\n2. Back up schools\n3. Other occupations\n4. Ask friends, family, classmates, academic advisors, counsellors for advices\n\nI'm kinda sorry for giving maybe not so helpful vague answer, but here are my thoughts anyways lol.",

It is best also to contact  [cstflex@bcit.ca](mailto:cstflex@bcit.ca) to ask more about your other options using Flex learning. They respond around 2-3 business days at most.",

    "postText": "Has anyone here taken this course (architectural or structural option), and is willing to share their thoughts and experiences?\n\nI'm trying to consider my options, and was also looking at ABET.  Is there any benefit to taking this CADD course first?  I have some renovation and light drafting experience, but nothing yet that I'd confidently put on my resume.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to hear what you thought of the course, the workload, any practicums required (if any), and anything else you'd have appreciated knowing before starting the course.  \n\nThank you so much for your time!",

            "comment": "I took this program before covid hit, about 4 years ago. Great program except it only teaches you a little bit of everything that you need to use on the job. But it got my foot in the door for my first drafting job and then the next at a much larger firm.\n\nI took the structural option and the architectural option is a lot more different. I don't know how they compare to the abet but you can talk with the program heads about that, probably by email.",

Is there anything in particular you'd recommend studying or researching beforehand?\n\nOdd question, but do you remember which particular building/rooms in the Burnaby campus the classes took place in?  I may take a trip to familiarize myself with the area.\n\nThanks again!",

I'm 26F and absolutely loved and did very well at drafting on AutoCAD in highschool. I've always been interested in a career in drafting but have only a lot of waitressing experience. Do you think I would I have trouble getting a job with just this certificate?",

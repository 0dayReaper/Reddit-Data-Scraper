Another option would be getting certified as a PMP with specialization in Agile which is used a lot in IT and software development... also learning SCRUM would help.\n\nhttps://www.pmi.org/certifications\n\nBut if it's mostly to help you understand the jargon and work processes, then I would just get an IT certificate regardless if it's graduate or post graduate level.\n\nhttps://www.bcit.ca/programs/business-analytics-graduate-certificate-full-time-a600grcert/\n\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/continuing-studies/programs/business-analysis-certificate.html",

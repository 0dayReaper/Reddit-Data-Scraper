I\u2019m currently super stressed about my current resume and cover letter, I feel like I\u2019m inadequate for not having enough work related experience to land my first intern. I know that personal project and grade could compensate lack of work experience. But can\u2019t stop thinking that I won\u2019t able to land a single intern and waste half a year.  Is there any current student or alumni would like to give me some advice or share their story of how you land your first internship. \nThanks you. \nP/s : this is my first post in Reddit",

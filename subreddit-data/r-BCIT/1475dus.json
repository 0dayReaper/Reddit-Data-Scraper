    "postText": "For content I\u2019m applying for the advanced placement HR diploma in September. I just finished my accounting diploma this April. The HR diploma has 5 prerequisite courses - 2 of which I haven\u2019t fulfilled. One is Business Math, and the other is Accounting for Managers. Unfortunately it was too late to register for Accounting for Managers. I\u2019ve reviewed the course outline and I\u2019ve learned everything in there from my accounting diploma. I\u2019ve also taken Finance 1 and 2 which is harder and has more credits than Business Math. I still really want to get into the program. They offer business math online so if I have to take it that\u2019s no problem. Is this a possibility? Has anyone ever dealt with this or has any advice? Thanks!",

However, just because a course you took was harder than the prerequisite, it doesn't mean it will be counted. The course should be the same subject and be accredited. Though I had a higher level for calculus and also an intro level to statistics. The program head said only the statistics course could be used to omit the course which was a stats class... also, you can have a combination of classes be used in lieu.",

    "postText": "I've read through pretty much all the posts here regarding this program, but was hoping to get some more opinions. I see a lot of conflicting info, some people saying it was great, and others saying its a total waste since you can just become an apprentice without it.\n\nI'm wondering what are the advantages of taking this program versus applying for apprenticeship position at random electrical companies with zero experience/knowledge &amp; hoping for the best?\n\nI'm not too concerned about the time wasted/money spent on the program (since the other careers paths I'm considering would be so much more costly in this department), more just how it could benefit career trajectory &amp; initial apprenticeship aspects (it seems apprenticeships vary company to company surely? In terms of specialization? i.e. commercial versus fire alarm versus security)\n\nThe main thing that interests me about electrical work is that there is a wide range of things to get into, and I'm wondering if the Electrical Foundations program would set me up better to get into more niche electrical work from the get-go (low voltage, PLC, especially A/V, etc.). \n\nANY info/opinions at all would be great! \n\nThanks :)",

[https://ejtc.org/apprenticeships/prerequisites-for-apprenticeship/](https://ejtc.org/apprenticeships/prerequisites-for-apprenticeship/) \n\nAlso, this mentions the entire program is 5 years from start to finish? I thought apprenticeships were 4 years? Or does the 5 years factor in schooling. 5 years is a huge commitment, longer than my whole undergrad, but I guess you're set when its over. Was wondering if you have any idea what the wages are like over these 5 years?",

One you're done the pre apprenticeship program and you're a 1st term you'll be making $23 an hour. I'm only a 4th term apprentice but I'm making $29 an hour. Journeyman rate is $43 and set to go up when our contract is renegotiated next year. You get $2 raises every 6 months (940 hours) if you're working full time.",

            "comment": "If you already have good fundamental hands on knowledge like for instance you can use basic hand tools, and have mechanical aptitude, then I would recommend skipping this. Throughout your whole apprenticeship you will be exposed to, and learn about the different directions that are paths in the electrical field. Regardless if you take it or not, finding your niche will be up to you. So there is little need for foundations unless you're a complete beginner and want the introductory experience \n\n\n I went straight to first year because I didn't want to spend the money and I already had the experience and knowledge to skip the basics. \nAlso at the time this program was expensive and not eligible for the gov grant. That was long ago and things may have changed\n\n\n\n\nThis is just my opinion, other's experiences may vary.",

I am also an enthusist in 12V electronics.   I would like to skip the fundamentals and go directly into the 1st year of training.    How did you go about to skipping the basic training and went into the 1 yr of training directly before??  Pls sheds some lights....thanks.",

I might even try attempt to challenge  first and/or second year if I were you.\nHere is some information to help familiarize yourself with the apprenticeship structure and workings. https://skilledtradesbc.ca/skilledtradescertification\n\n\nThere are a few different paths you can go, personally I went the union way and they helped me through the process and paid me a grant for each year of completed schooling. They take care of scheduling and paperwork for you. The other option is non-union which is ok too but you'll have to find an employer to sponsor you. So you're on your own where that's concerned\n\n\nI've been out of school for over a decade so my experience may be dated but I'm pretty sure you can just apply to first year even without a sponsor employer\n\n\nGood luck and pm me if you need any more help or pointers",

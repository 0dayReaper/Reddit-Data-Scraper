I've been looking at the KPU Diploma in Computer Information Systems which has co-op. BCIT is more reputable when it comes to IT so I was looking at the CIT/CST programs and CISA but a lot of them are full time. Also, I don't want to narrow my studies just into cyber security in case Cyber security doesn't work out I want to go into another field in IT.\n\nCan anyone please suggest a part-time program at BCIT that would that would help me in my current situation?\n\nAm currently studying for my Sec+ cert and plan to do some other certs later.\n\nKPU Diploma in Computer Information Systems\n\n[https://calendar.kpu.ca/programs-az/business/computer-information-systems/computer-information-systems-diploma/#requirementstext](https://calendar.kpu.ca/programs-az/business/computer-information-systems/computer-information-systems-diploma/#requirementstext)",

Obviously BCIT will be better but if you can\u2019t go full time then it\u2019s probably not worth it, especially since you get access to co-op with the kpu program. Also, you can transfer to comp sci if you do later choose to get a bachelors.",

I would rather go for the diploma since it allows you to transfer into a bachelors degree if you ever do change your mind in the future and at the very least allows you to apply for government jobs. Personally, I would take the diploma program at KPU, take some practical udemy courses (software dev / sys admin stuff) along with the program, and use the udemy course to build up a portfolio with a couple of projects. Using all of that, get a co-op in software / QA / devops / sysadmin (whatever interests you). Then later down the road try to get into cyber security once you've built up more experience.\n\nHowever, maybe the program you linked will allow you to move up to a more technical position in your current company and you can start working towards your career in that way. It's difficult for me to give any input and that's probably something you can find out by networking with team managers in different areas in your company.",

I can assure you that this is something you should consider if you want to work and study at the same time. \n\nOne final note, once you have the CST diploma, you will also have an option to take Bachelor's degree in CST. It is currently BTech but it will soon be change to BSc. Something worth considering.",

Plus I have IT project on going that will help expedite stuff that is specific to where I work.\n\nFor courses, if you are working, it will be 3 courses max. But it depends on you. I was able to do 4-5  courses while working full time which is an extreme way of doing it. If you are doing more than 3 then you should have a part time job unless you can fully commit to get good grades or pass it without any issues.\n\nAs for quality, in general, the majority of the professors are also working in the industry because they are part-time professors also. That means they really give students real life scenarios and let you in what is happening in the real world setting. But as always, there are some bad eggs but you have a chance of dodging them because you choose your own course rather than block.\n\nAll in all I would say, they are good at guiding students. Studying is really half from the institution and half from the student effort.",

The consensus in the industry at the moment is that people from different backgrounds can come to the job to start doing cybersecurity but I differ in that sentiment. I still belief technical foundation is critical. But then again, you most likely want to shape your path based on industry demand. In short, my advice is to talk to the industry experts and gauge what they want from new grads. From my experience, entry into cybersecurity is very hard in Vancouver oddly. \n\nAnother thing to consider whether you want to aim for Cybersecurity in legal sense or IT security - in which case you can have security knowledge as part of the toolset you have. Just try to narrow down what domain you want to target your career path early, because there are pentester roles as well as cybersecurity analyst, incidence response, security engineer etc. a lot of people don\u2019t know exactly what they wanna get into",

Just about every job posting I've seen (and I'm actively looking) has qualifications/expectations that pretty much mean you must have IT experience, and often 2+ years even for entry level roles. Anything actually interesting is like 5+ years in security, experience in programming, etc.",

Go to any of security meetups in Vancouver and they will tell you the same (Bsides). But yeah I do get your point that you are reading those things in requirements etc. it varies for cybersecurity title roles, but probably not so much for security engineering roles.",

Which probably means we know each other lol. They fill all my thursdays lol. Already have my tickets for bsides as well. I guess my conversations on the topic have been different than yours. I've not met a bunch of people at these meetups that are actually responsible for hiring. They're mostly just grunts themselves getting a job done? And rarely have i seen anyone mention open positions at their place of employment that they're looking to fill. I think the OWASP one's probably attract the most people that are in like, a position to hire people, but i still haven't gotten the impression from anyone there that they'll take anyone. maybe anyone that's done a ton of self-taught development and have some skills, not necessarily with a degree or diploma, but skills nonetheless.",

KPU is a college that is mostly a visa mill these days or for kids located close to its campus who want a short commute. Therefore, its impossible to find classes you need on time and why people take 6 years to graduate a bachelors degree.\n\nBCIT is mental torture. I repeat it is mental torture. The face on my bcit id card from 2017 compared to 2019 exemplifies just how crazy the workload is and what it did to me mentally. That said, instructors are mostly very good. You will get every class you need on time as you are placed in sets and as long as you didnt fail anything you will be fine. You will be job ready after just the CIT/CST diploma. This can then be laddered into either a degree btech (or they are making a new CS degree option so 2 more years after diploma) or another discipline through bridging like tech mmgt, business admin, GIS etc. You can also do these degrees part time after your full time diploma so you can start earning money maybe even have your work pay for part of your tuition.\n\nEDIT: after reading your original post i see that you are looking for a part time option definitely look into BCIT's part time diploma or certificate options. They have so many options in network and industrial security telecom.",

    "postText": "Hi Friends :) \n\nI\u2019m a recent grad from UBC and am looking at BCIT\u2019s diagnostic sonography program. Im thinking about taking all the prereq courses (other than English) before starting my application at BCIT. I\u2019ve taken biology courses before at UBC but that was back in first year so I believe that upgrading is preferred? \nAlso my pre-calc 12 grades were not the best.. so I was thinking about also taking the BCIT equivalents of the required math and physics courses.\nNow this is that I need advice on.. would I be putting myself at a disadvantage by applying with the BCIT upgraded equivalents? My grades that I\u2019m hoping BCIT looks at will be solely based on the BCIT prereq courses essentially.\nSorry if this a confusing post, I appreciate any advice!! \ud83d\ude03",

            "comment": "BCIT looks at your pre-requisites GPA only, I have confirmed with the program advisor (not Sonography, but another health program).  Because all the pre-reqs are high school level, you also compete with high school grads. High school courses are easy to get A, so they may have advantages. You should take BCIT BHSC 1200 (Human anatomy &amp; Physiology) with Byssam. English is not my 1st language but I got A+ on Anatomy. BCIT calculus also very easy, homework worth 40%, midterm and final each worth 30%, another easy A+ course. I took Calculus 2 at BCIT, and Calculus 1 at another school, from my experience, BCIT's math is easier. Do not take Physics at BCIT, unless you are good at it. I took General physics 1&amp;2 there, they gave me a hard time; the lab reports are insane, final exam tests you on very thing from the beginning.",

We don\u2019t care if you graduated in 1962. If we ask for your Grade 12, we want your grade 12. If there is a recency requirement we will say so, but otherwise just send us your grade from grade 12, whenever the hell it was. \n\nCheck with BCIT to get their policy but I suspect it\u2019s the same.",

If you read my other comments, you\u2019ll see I addressed the issue of credits expiring. But people are conflating credits and grades, which are NOT the same thing. And yes, if you don\u2019t finish, your CREDITS expire. If you do finish, but want to apply previous credits to a new credential, your credits might be too old and so the material is obsolete and you will need to take updated courses. The grade you got remains the grade you got but you can no longer use that course toward a credential. That is not your grade expiring. That is your credit becoming unusable because the stuff you were taught is not longer relevant. If you order a transcript, your grade will still be your grade. This shouldn\u2019t be a hard concept. \n\nThat said, most of the HS grades in question when we\u2019re dealing with admissions are in subjects like English, math, physics, etc. These are not time-sensitive. Your ability to read, write, think critically, and formulate an argument - which is what your English grade measures, for example - does not suddenly expire after ten years. Although given the number of people having trouble with the concept of grade vs. credit I am beginning to wonder. \n\nAND, as I said before, if there is a recency requirement that will be clearly stated. Otherwise, your high school grade is what we want, no matter how old it is. If that grade is too low, you will have options for either substituting a different course or retaking the original course. In the case of a recency requirement, you will need to take a current course to fulfill the requirements. But not because your grade \u201cexpired.\u201d",

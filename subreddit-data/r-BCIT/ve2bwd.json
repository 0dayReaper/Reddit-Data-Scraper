    "postText": "The title is the question I have.\n\nI am fairly good at both math and physics but I haven't used a lot of tools or done a lot of hands on work with machinery in my life.( I'm very keen to develop this skill, though). I'm just wondering how much of the program is dedicated to this? Is there anyway to prepare ahead of time? Should I consider a different program or perhaps a preparatory program that involves tools?\n\nThanks",

I wrote to the International Student Association a Letter of Interest with a request for an update and and I was given a satisfactory reply and finally I got an email within the span of 2 months to accept the seat for the final acceptance. For the acceptance-I had the window of 24 hours and then I had ten days to pay my commitment fees.",

    "postText": "I am a new grad from the CIT program at BCIT. Had 8 months of coop experience as a software engineer. I spent almost 4 months in a job seeking like an entry-level or junior developer job but nothing left due to the recession. My friends suggested I complete a degree either in university or BCIT. Is that a good choice or still looking for a job? Kindly left your advice. Appreciate it. Thanks! ",

            "comment": "Sadly, if you transfer to UBC, you will be starting from scratch. There might be some courses that they might consider and give you a few credits (chances are low though).\n\nIf you are interested in getting a degree, then I suggest you to take on the new Bachelor's of Science in Applied Computer Science (BScACS) at BCIT. You have an option to do it in full-time and part-time, though if you are interested in the game dev your only option is to do Full-time.\n\nAnother option you can do is do part-time so that you can still look for a job and have a job while studying. \n\nTake note, that if you will be pursuing the degree at BCIT you will be taking some bridging courses since essential courses for that degree are not part of the CIT curriculum.",

            "comment": "Tbh OP 4 months job seeking isn\u2019t a lot. It took me and my friends a lot longer to get developer jobs. That included constantly applying and looking. \n\nAre you only looking at job titles that are for software engineers? Look at other IT/developer jobs descriptions and apply according. Sometimes companies list job responsibilities similar to the job you\u2019re looking for but call the title something else. \n\nAs for your friend suggesting to transfer from BCIT to UBC that is ill advised advice. One BCIT has better computing science programs and different related programs then UBC. You also get more technical skills.\n\nI also don\u2019t think there\u2019s a point for you to do more schooling for a degree. The CIT program from BCIT is highly regarded in the industry. A bachelors degree won\u2019t really help you. In fact many people do the opposite, have bachelor degrees but lack the technical skills and come to BCIT to get actual skills to use in the industry/workforce (personally know many who feel like they wasted years of schooling and money because of this).\n\nAlso forgot to ask, do you have a portfolio? This will help you land better jobs/opportunities. Look on ways you can update it if you do have one. Stay active and keep posting on LinkedIn as well. There\u2019s also a slow down in the tech sector and hiring freezes. So keep applying and keep your head up.",

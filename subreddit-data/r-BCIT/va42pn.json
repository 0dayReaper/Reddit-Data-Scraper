A 1080p resolution is fine, and you do not need a high refresh rate monitor, 144hz tops.  Of course this is dependant on your budget and future potential usage.  Are you planning on keeping this laptop for a while?  Will this be the main/only computer you will use for school?\n\nI looked into this last year and that will provide you the best platform that will carry you through school, and likely beyond.",

Check out the Asus G14: https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/rog-zephyrus-g14-14-gaming-laptop-grey-amd-ryzen-7-5800hs-512gb-ssd-16gb-ram-rtx-3050/15481574\n\nIt's a gaming laptop, but it's a lot closer to an ultrabook than the gaming laptops of yester-year. At 14\", only 3.5lbs and a 10h battery it's amazing for portability and light use. When you plug it into the wall, though, you get a real 8-core/16-thread beast. 16gb RAM is plenty for most people but it is upgradeable past that if your applications need it (half of the memory is soldered but the other 8gb can be swapped for up to a 32gb stick, for 40gb total).\n\nTake a look at the specs and compare it to the requirements of any software you'll be using, especially any CAD/modeling or simulation programs, but this is most likely plenty. Then I'd recommend taking the budget you saved and buying yourself a nice large screen to dock it to at home. Especially with anything visual like design work, there's just no substitute for physical display size. Can you do everything on a 13-15\" laptop screen? Yes. Is it far better to work on a 30\" monitor, even if it's only 1440p? Also yes.",

The performance is on par with the higher-end G14 model (the one I linked is the lower end one) but you'll get less frame rate and battery because of the screen. It's also a full pound heavier. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but after years of carrying laptops around schools, every pound really matters to your back. Personally I'd go for the G14 and a nice monitor at home, but that's my priorities speaking.",

Will also be expensive.\n16gb is nice but 8gb is fine if you have budget restrictions. \nSame with i7, it's nice but i5 is fine too or whatever amd equivalent, idk much about amd. Quad core is solid enough, more if u have the budget.\nFor display, 1080 is fine, 60Hz is also probably fine unless you want to game too. 17inch is overkill, 15inch if u want a solid display, less if u want to be super light. \nKeep in mind that you'll almost always have access to school computers with good enough performance to run any of the programs you'll need. If u live nearby you can always access the ehpod too. \nI do agree with windows tho, if u get a Mac you'll end up having to emulate windows for something eventually and that's a pain in the ass. \nIt mostly depends on your budget though, if you can give a number you're looking at I can give more specific recommendations. \nIs it something you're going to keep using for a long time or is it something you're going to use for school and then upgrade to the latest and greatest when you're done?",

I hear the keyboard is also pretty solid. Spec wise you can get it pretty great. In 2000 dollars you can probably spring for 16gb, i7 or equivalent, and at least a 3050 or even a 3050ti. If you're keeping it for a decade and want to game try to find a 3060 and consider a bigger screen. I like being able to write and draw on my computer.

Could stick with a 13 and buy an extra monitor for use at home. Or buy a lighter duty laptop and a desktop, which is what I have. Guess it depends how important weight is too. I've had good experiences with Dell, although I know people who have had battery issues.",

The OP will be using programs that will be used in 3D, much more demanding with larger projects than 2D.  \n\nAnd as they have replied, my suggestion suits their budget perfectly.  Ll",

Most people ended up using them for taking notes/annotating presentations and they are powerful enough for almost all of the required work. For anything else, you can use remote desktop into the civil schools server and use programs such as autocad/civil 3D.",

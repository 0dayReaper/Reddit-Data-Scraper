    "postText": "Hi, I'm interested in taking the HRM diploma and am curious if anyone can share their experience with it \u2014 did it lead to any positions? Is there anything I could do to set myself up for success early on? I have a BMus and no HR/business/office experience so it will be a hard transition but it's a shift I need to make and I feel HR aligns with my skill set.\n\nEdit: Worth mentioning that I'm looking into the Advanced Placement since I have a degree already and I'm aware of the upcoming info session.\n\nThanks for your help!",

            "comment": "Took it a few years ago now, great program, very intense course load-wise and expectations on your performance are pretty high. The instructor's were all extremely well regarded in the field, I've met a lot of people in my career who were excited to hear that I had X instructor at BCIT.\n\nTo prepare, I recommend looking at any of the courses you could possibly take beforehand, preferably a course you think you'd struggle with. The course load is very heavy and if you're getting stuck on one course it'll absolutely hold you back on performing in your other courses.\n\nEdit: I know that some of my friends in the program who came from advanced placement struggled with the report writing aspect and/or Excel. If that is something you feel uncomfortable with, I recommend looking to see if there are any courses you can pre-emptively take (since in year 2 there is little support if you're behind in these areas).",

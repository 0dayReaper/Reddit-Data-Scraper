There are a few steps mind you so I can appreciate peoples reluctance.\n\nAt a glace..\n\n**Prescription Drugs:**  \nReimbursed at 80% to a maximum of $3,000 per benefit year. Based on the BC Provincial Formulary with a generic rider. \n\n **Vision:**  \nReimbursed at 100%, $60 for one eye exam, $150 for glasses or contact lenses every 24 months. \n\n **Health Practitioners:**  \nThe services of paramedical practitioners are reimbursed at 80%. Each service has an overall plan maximum of $400 based on reasonable and customary charges, per benefit year. Practitioners must be registered and licensed in their field of practice. \n\n**Dental Coverage:**  \nExams covered at 80% once per benefit year. Overall plan maximum of $750 per benefit year. \n\n[Source](https://www.mystudentplan.ca/bcit/en/mybenefits)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't care about subs or anything. just use your damn benefits lol.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it's helpful, share with new students please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers.",

            "comment": "As a part of her Master\u2019s thesis my friend is conducting a study titled \"The Guilt of Success: An Exploration of Family Achievement Guilt Among Canadian Students\". Family achievement guilt is a socioemotional experience some students might face related to surpassing or leaving family\u009d to attend university. \n\nTo participate in this study, you must be a current Canadian university student. Participation in this research study will require you to answer questions about your university experience surrounding family achievement guilt, cultural congruency, negative emotional symptoms, and empathic concern. This study is an anonymous survey which will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may choose to withdraw at any time without question or risk of penalty. I also promise to protect your confidentiality and anonymity. You will be given the chance to enter a draw to win one of four $50 amazon gift cards. The information letter at the beginning of the study will explain details of the study.\nThis study has been approved by the Research Ethics Board (Pro00124051) at the University of Alberta. \nThank you so much for your time and consideration.",

Or take transit the whole way.\n\nAlternatively, don't pay, park on BCIT property, and change your plate every few times you get ticketed. (I don't know how feasible that is. I chose to just pay and not worry about it. Too busy.)",

Now most dont tow unless you have multiple outstanding tickets but they technically could if they wanted to. Not sure if people actually change their plate to avoid getting towed, i would think changing plates costs money and if you're going to be spending money to do that you might as well just pay for parking or the ticket.",

I've just heard of people doing this before to get out of tickets.\n\nThere is no fake plate, and because it's a *private lot* (not municipal parking) there's no legal requirement to pay the ticket.\n\nYou rack up tickets on a plate. After enough unpaid tickets (I'm randomly recalling 4-ish?) there's a risk they'll tow you, but that's only legal for them to do if there's a warning displayed on the lot's sign that they will tow. So before they tow you, you go to an insurance broker and pay to have your coverage transferred to a new plate. You ignore any threatening letters you get from the parking company. They can't affect your credit score. They can't affect your ability to re-insure. All they can do is tow your car every time you park in one of their lots, and only if the plate matches your tickets.\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-parking-private-lots-1.3851956",

If there's someone richer than you who likes you, who also happens to own real estate near the Burnaby campus or one of the satellite campuses, you might even get free room and board and be walking distance to campus. If I were you I'd go to Willingdon Church and make some inquiries.\n\nYou could play the cat and mouse game with private parking companies like those impark assholes due to how the law around how the parking business is structured, but the peace of mind trumps playing cat and mouse with the private parking companies.",

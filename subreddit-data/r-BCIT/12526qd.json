Basically, you try to kick the obstacles out of your way (a.k.a. get things done) and say \u201cF-CK YOU\u201d to whatever that\u2019s getting in between you and the obstacles, whether it be the learning curve, your tired self, your fried brain, cute guys/girls you\u2019re crushing on, or new games that are coming out soon. F-CK THEM \u2018cause nobody ain\u2019t got time for that sh*t.\n\nSorry for the coarse language, but you need to have that energy for this to work. That\u2019s how I got into co-op and maintained an above 90% average with no prior coding background. It really works.",

                            "comment": "TLDR; Yes and no. more yes for big name companies, less for smaller ones. Depends on many other factors of the candidate.\n\n\nFirst of all, there's one key thing to remember: CST is a diploma program and not a Bachelor's program. A diploma weighing more than/equivalent to a Bachelor's is not common sense (We're BCIT and not MIT lol). It's just a matter of \"How much more does a Bachelor's weigh compared to a diploma.\"\n\nCompanies care about it if you're straight out of school with no work experience. You have nothing to offer other than the academic performances, then that's the only thing they will look into.\n\nSide projects help, but imo unless you made something remarkable, the companies can probably find someone with a Bachelor's degree that has the ability to create the same thing (That doesn't mean you shouldn't be grinding on it when you have the chance. It's still better than not having one and they teach you a lot).\n\nBUT, what made CST a bit different are the hands-on experiences they force you to go through. Many courses (can't say all) are closer to the industry than the uni courses, and the workload that CST puts you through shapes you into an ideal candidate that can pick up technologies quickly and be productive to the company a little bit faster. It's even better if you have gone through co-op since you had adapted to a real working environment before. (Plus, being hired already means you have the qualities one company finds suitable, there's no reason to not believe you won't be to the other)\n\nI would say CST is still pretty competitive for non big name companies. FAANG (or MANGA, whatever they're called now) and many big name companies kind of care about a degree (\"a degree\" not \"the degree\" *) because of how their positions are highly sought after. Plenty of Bachelor's and Master's grads with good experiences are applying to them, why would they choose a diploma holder over someone with a Bachelor's or Master's?\n\nLuckily, this industry tends to weigh personal abilities and experiences over a degree as time goes on in the career. Most of the learning materials are online, and technologies change rapidly. If you can keep up with the pace and prove yourself valuable, the degree matters less.\n\nI've talked to alumni that made it to FAANG within 5 years (with blood and sweat ofc).\n\n\n* \"A degree not the degree\" : Unsure why, but I've seen people with unrelated STEM Bachelor's or Master's that got into a FAANG. Some of them only went through 6-month bootcamp and a lot of self learning. (Civil Eng., Mech Eng., MSE, Biochem, even Psychology to name a few). I personally got an interview with a big name company as I was looking for co-op, I think it's also related to the STEM Bachelor's I have.\n\n\nJust my two cents, I'm definitely not qualified to tell you these are the facts.",

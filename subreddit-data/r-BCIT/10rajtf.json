            "comment": "A major is what your studies focus on and what discipline you will graduate from. It mostly applies to university degrees that allow you to choose your course of study. Some examples: Bachelor of Science degree with a major in biology, or a major in physics, or chemistry. A bachelor of arts degree with a major in English, or a major in history, or visual arts. \n\nAfter a few years of university you have to declare your major because there are specific course requirements that you need to fulfill in order to graduate from your chosen degree program. \n\nAt BCIT however, the programs are very structured and you don't have a lot of room to choose course and pick a major.  You enroll in a specific program that BCIT offers",

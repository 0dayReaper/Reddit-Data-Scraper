    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI'm an international student starting OPMAN this fall (Sept. 2022). I'm looking to connect with fellow students from the course. Is there any way to go about it? Maybe a Facebook group or BCIT Student service that connects students that I'm unaware of? \n\nAlso, If any past OPMAN graduates are reading this, could you please give your review of the course and what to expect? What's the workload like?\n\nThanks.",

    "postText": "Was hoping any BTECH CS students could help me out. I\u2019m a CIT student graduating this term and want to go into BTECH part time after this term to get my degree (after bridging).\n\nI had a question regarding entrance requirements. I didn\u2019t see it in on the program website but is there a minimum gpa you must have from CIT or CST to get in? I know the Engineering degree programs require you to have atleast a 70% gpa across your diploma while the actual cutoff is much higher.\n\nWondering if this is the same with CST BTECH? I want to do it part time so I wouldn\u2019t be competing for seats.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am planning to do the \\[Digital Forensic and Cybersecurity Program\\]. Recently, I've been seeing a lot of negative comments, primarily guided at professors, and job prospects. I would like to know more from people who are currently in this course or graduated. What are the job prospects? Is co-op good? What is the typical salary range?",

            "comment": "You've probably seen my negative comments about the professors already if you've been reading posts here  \n\n\nWhat I didn't go into was the job prospects. Lots of people from BCIT seem to get jobs with RCMP/VPD/CRA, etc - but looking at their job postings... you're probably starting at 50-65k/year max. I consider that low... but you may feel otherwise.   \n\n\nHaving looked at private industry as well - I am not sure this program is sufficient to even get you in the door. not without doing a lot of work on your own skills in your own time. but it's a very wide industry with lots of variation in jobs, at least in cybersecurity. You won't get a job doing penetration testing with just this program. but you might get an entry level SOC Analyst position or something where you spend most of your time reviewing SIEM reports or something.",

Whether it's technical support, networking, software development, cybersecurity, or any other field in IT - you need far more than what the programs offer. They offer you some basic skills and an intro to the subject - but if you want a good job, you need experience. a portfolio. You need to know more than what the teachers were slinging at you. Those that are successful in IT, and graduate with good jobs, tend to go a lot farther on their own. personal projects, self-directed study, homelabs, etc.   \n\n\nThats not to say certificates and degrees aren't worth anything... they'll give you a taste and get you past the HR crap. But you'll probably need more to actually get hired. even for entry level stuff. But thats just my experience.",

Save your money, unless you really want to do digital forensics (there are a few courses that basically give you access to the full digital forensics program(s) to get you familiarize with. Honestly, I had a pretty good time and felt like i was getting my moneys worth during the first two years. In my last year now and i only enjoyed one class. Working on my grad project soon.\n\nIf you want to get into cybersecurity, look elsewhere. Heck, most of the stuff they teach they pull off google searches and other free resources available online. You will want to look up how to create a lab environment and then go through practices in the lab so as to not infect your main machine. You\u2019ll also wanna learn how to work with wireshark.",

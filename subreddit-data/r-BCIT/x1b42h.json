And for social life, it\u2019s possible but you will make friends in the program",

Make a calendar and add all the deadlines for assignments/tests etc. Start doing assignments right when they\u2019re assigned, work with people in your set, and use lab time efficiently. Also start studying for exams way in advance (a little bit at a time) and it saves you a lot of stress. I was able to finish about 90% of my work during the week and have weekends free :)",

            "comment": "It's possible to maintain a social life while being in the ABT program. Here are some general/quick tips off the top of my head:\n\n* DO NOT procrastinate. Almost every class will serve you homework or projects as if they are the only class that you are taking.\n* Don't be afraid to ask questions, especially during lab time. Use that time efficiently.\n* This might sound like a dumb tip but I mean it when I say it: Try and really be interested in what you are learning. I am not sure what your individual circumstance is or why you chose the ABT program, but everything comes easier when you actually want to learn.\n* Make friends in the program. You will need them for group study sessions and reliable project members, etc. Even if you are more of a solo learner, like myself, I guarantee you that will find times where you will want to be in a group because some exams and subjects can be quite challenging if you go at it 100% solo, such as the structural design class.\n* Every project/assignment doesn't have to be perfect. You will have a million things to do. Learn the subject, get the work done efficiently, and carry on. Personally I was a \\~65 to 70% type of guy.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to talk further, or about career paths, etc.",

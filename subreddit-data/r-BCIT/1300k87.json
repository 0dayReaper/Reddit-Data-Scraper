Or you just happened to pick the right company to apply to and they were actually hiring. These are the things you can't control and why you should expect to job hunt for a few months after finishing.\n\nNetworking and pickiness - If you're really picky about where you want to work or what languages/frameworks/systems you want to work with, it limits your options and can make it take longer. If you don't do any networking and just apply for jobs online, it will probably take longer. Tons of jobs never get posted online because companies ask around for people to hire first. Having the best technical skills in the class doesn't mean you will get a job. The grads with great social and networking skills tend to get jobs the fastest.",

I met similar people from my class; I don't even know what he is saying. Don't interrupt the professor, don't make your classmate annoyed. If you want to ask dumb questions, ask privately, so I won't feel embarrassed.",

Not to sit in class and make sure you aren't annoyed. Kinda entitled to think everything revolves around you hey?",

You respect the teacher and the class. Not only me get annoyed by this type of people, but also my classmates. They also complain that someone frequently asking stupid questions which disturb the class. We could miss some important points because of listening to his/her crap.",

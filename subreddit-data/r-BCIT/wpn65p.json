Yes, I\u2019m aware it\u2019s a competitive field. Yes I\u2019m aware companies prefer people with more education. I have seen this question get asked on this forum before and people just seem to shit on the post. \n\nSo, has anyone taken this specific course, not ASD, not AWD, not CST and landed a job? Y",

Normally they have a bachelor's degree supplemented from their home country.\n\nEdit: yeah I search up LinkedIn and there are people who got entry level jobs from this certification. Most of them already possess a bachelor's, most from science and engineering.",

    "postText": "Hi again to whoever is reading. I am writing this as I\u2019m having a mini mental breakdown and just completely stressing myself out. I wanted advice from graduates of Cit or cst but preferably CIT as I\u2019m in that program. As I mentioned in my previous post I passed my first term It\u2019s just I know for a fact even if my grades are amazing in term 2 I don\u2019t think a average of my term 1 and term 2 grades will allow me to get into co - op. I\u2019ve been reading for hours into the bcit Reddit and have seen a couple times people saying students without co op found difficultly in finding jobs. However I also understand co op is a boost but doesn\u2019t guarantee a job, in the end it comes down to you. I\u2019m 18 right now turning 19 this summer and have just finished term 1 of cit. I don\u2019t think a switch to CST is possible as I would already be done term 2 of cit by the time jan 2024 CST starts and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get in as the average is a 89% I read. As I\u2019m still young and still going into term\n2 of cit what do you grads recommend I do in this coming summer and summer 2024 (I\u2019ll have these off assuming I pass all classes all terms) to really help give the same boost co op would or just in general what can I do now to help myself later. Also what route can I take to get into a software dev Position without qualifying for co op and being a CIT grad not a CST grad. I\u2019m really stressing myself out for no reason as I just feel doomed that im going to put all this time into the program and it might not even help me to get a job. Please if you guys have any advice anything at all it would be appreciated. I would also appreciate if maybe a cit grad who didn\u2019t do co op tell me about their experience finding a job. Thank you all",

            "comment": "Hey bigbootyhoes123, I know the feeling. It\u2019s anxiety and stress of school and the future\u2026\n\nI graduated from CST during the middle of Covid and have worked with people from all types of background. Half of my coworkers don\u2019t even have CS or IT degrees, never mind co-ops, just bootcamps and experience. \n\nThere are people who entered 1st term CST with me, did not do the co-op program, and were able to graduate 8 months before me and start working after graduation making an actual salary. \n\nI also have several CST friends who now work in IT. Most recruiters don\u2019t know even know or care about the difference between IT and software. The skills are easily transferable, plus with the rapid change in technology, they like people who can adapt.\n\nWhat mainly matters about getting a job is project experience (BCIT industry projects, personal projects, coursework projects), and some enthusiasm at the interview, (and of course just plain luck). Managers love seeing people who are interested in their work and also have hobbies outside of tech. \n\nI would advise you to focus on your hobbies, physical and mental health, and focus on what drew you into CIT in the first place. Your grades are already good, so I know you can do anything you put your mind too. \n\nAlso, please stay off this subreddit. Reddit generally tends to be quite negative. Most posts here are from people who are also freaking out so it feeds into the cycle of people being freaked out by other posts then posting about the same thing \ud83d\ude05. Things aren\u2019t as bleak out there. \n\nDM me if you want to talk more.",

Yes I agree for sure I need to stay off Reddit I did a deep look into it for hours and completely stressed myself out for no reason. What projects should I do however, if I want to try going for a software dev role should I focus more so on programming projects? What drew me into CIT was that it was broad, I\u2019m still not sure exactly what I want to do but I choose CIT as I felt it gave me the best taste of everything. Thank you for offering to DM aswell I may take that chance up soon or the next time I stress myself out! Thank you so much again",

I have used it for both school and work. \n\nThere\u2019s so many good tutorials out there and it is easy to get overwhelmed by the choices. Just start with one and see if you like the type of work you do. Eventually you will find so many similarities between all types of libraries/frameworks, and you will find it really fast to pick up new ones.\n\nHave fun!",

            "comment": "Are you interested in having a Bachelor's degree?\n\nInstead of thinking of transferring to CST why not just finish CIT and continue to BScACS. You have two option for that degree: 1) Do Full-time degree; 2) Do part-time degree ( this option is a bit longer but you are able to work while studying).\n\nBut do note that if you are a CIT grad, you need to take some bridging courses to be able to qualify to BScACS.\n\nAs for job after CIT, other than Coop, I suggest you start building networks with different people in and out school. I suggest to join clubs at BCIT (BCIT Dev Hub, Computing Club, Code 4 All, Women in Computing, etc.) and start connecting with people.  \n\n\nlink for club list:\n\n[https://www.bcitsa.ca/clubs/](https://www.bcitsa.ca/clubs/)",

                            "comment": "Is it worth doing? Really depends on your goal. And if you ask my opinion Doing Bachelor's give you broader or spectrum of options. You will be more competitive in the Job Market, I am not saying that Diploma is not though. Bachelor's also align to my goal in taking grad school.\n\nI forgot to mention, If you are looking for a job outside Canada, Let's say US, having Bachelor's will make it easier to get a TN Visa.\n\nAs for the club, join each of them nothing is wrong in joining multiple clubs. usually you just join their discord server and mingle with people if they are active. Summer break is coming, I would say this is a good time to reach out to build network since you will not be busy with studies.",

There are lots of resources in the school that can help you, like BCITSA, talk to your instructors.\n\nCIT is broad  and don\u2019t care too much about co-op. Focus on building your experience through course works and projects.\n\nIf you are interested in software dev, make sure you are comfortable in different programming languages, git, scrum, and other best practices.\n\nThink a little personal project, no need to be too big.  Just enough to demonstrate your skills around FE, BE, db, etc. And build it step by step.\nIt don\u2019t need to be perfect.\n\nEnjoy your study with your cohort (set mates)\n\nAdvise: don\u2019t spend too much time on Reddit; the real world is MUCH bigger than you think",

I also apologize for my username I didn\u2019t realize it was this as I barly use Reddit. Do you guys recommend any boot camps at all to do over the summer as I was looking at lighthouse labs and was wondering if it was worth it or not to do over the summer before going into term 2. I really wanna spend my 2 summers before graduating really building on myself and resume, if you guys had to start over or recommend something what would it be. I\u2019m looking into boot camps but don\u2019t know if they are worth it or which boot camps employers look for?",

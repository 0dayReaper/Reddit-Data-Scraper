It's a combination of having an accredited undergrad degree in engineering, work experience, and some exams to become a P.Eng.\n\nThe costs and time will differ if you're in the first or second scenario. You can get rough estimates by starting with the EGBC website.",

I have no degree at all.\n\nOf course an accredited program is the easiest path if you are starting with no existing education. But it is not the only path.\n\n[https://techexam.ca/2022/12/how-to-choose-the-province-where-you-should-qualify-as-a-professional-engineer-for-technical-exams](https://techexam.ca/2022/12/how-to-choose-the-province-where-you-should-qualify-as-a-professional-engineer-for-technical-exams)",

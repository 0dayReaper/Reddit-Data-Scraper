    "postText": "I'm currently going into my second term of ECET. I got a 93 average for first term, so I was wondering if I'm eligible for any academic scholarships. One of my friends got a 96 and the other got 93 as well. This makes me believe my grade might not meet the requirements for it.\nDoes anyone have info regarding this?\nAlso, am I allowed to ask the program head about this.",

            "comment": "BCIT offers a few academic based scholarships/monetary rewards for academic achievement. The good news is that if you qualify for any academic awards that BCIT gives out there is no need to apply, they awarded automatically. I\u2019m not sure if they award anything between term 1 and term 2, but they do on completion on your first year and on program completion.\n\nYou can ask your program head anything, but try to look it up on your own first. Look up BCITs awards and scholarships on the website and you will find more information. And apply to a bursary if you\u2019re eligible, may as well try for it.\n\nSource: got my ECET diploma last year. Received a few awards at BCIT, didn\u2019t apply for any. Applied for a bursary, received a bursary.",

    "postText": "My goal right now is to do two/three semesters part time, and apply for the 3rd level of the full time diploma (to eventually go into the BBA program). I didn\u2019t get good grades in high school besides an 85 in English 12, but I am doing OPMT 0199 to upgrade my Math 11. How competitive are the full time diploma admissions? What should I be prepared for?",

Advanced placement is competitive, because they only accept # of student who dropped off, and there are so many part-time students want to get into the fulltime. Fulltime, $3000 tuition a term. Part-time, $750 a course. Do the math.",

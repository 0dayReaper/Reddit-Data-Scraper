    "postText": "Hi! I am a student from Vietnam, who just applied and got an letter of offer for Industrial Network Cybersecurity. However, I prefer Computer Systems Technology and my cousin, who graduated from here, said that it is definitely possible to change the program between those, just walk up to the staff and ask them for help. I am not sure if I can change without having to make an entirely new application, thanks for your help!  \n\n\nAlso another question here, are the courses difficult, and do I have to worry too much about getting jobs? I know the tech job market is really open these days, and not getting a job means you are really, REALLY incompetent, but my imposter syndrome says otherwise.",

Can't help you with the program change question since I don't have experience with that.\n\nThere are many job openings out there but competition is fierce and it's not easy to get a job. Co-op program is not easy to get into since they pick the top 15 or 20% students only, but if you can get into that program it shouldn't be hard to find a job after graduation. Also think about getting some related certificates, and/or do some personal projects so your resume will look better.\n\nThe program itself is hard enough that you will see approx. 1/3 students drop or fail the program by the end. You will have a lot of homework/projects to work on so be ready.",

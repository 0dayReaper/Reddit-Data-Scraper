Next time they call ignore or say you\u2019re not that person and next letter don\u2019t open it just write return to sender and put it back in the mail.

But try calling first to explain, they can reduce your rate with a discount if they find the explanation viable.\n\nI was told by classmates that I shouldn\u2019t pay like in the rest of these comments, but they were all 18 year old guys who had racked up tickets and one had their car towed. An unpaid parking ticket could be to your disadvantage for future situations having to do with your car.\n\nJust take it as a good learning lesson for how strict parking companies can be, so it can be remembered for future. I paid and I don\u2019t have to deal with any fears having to do with my car now.",

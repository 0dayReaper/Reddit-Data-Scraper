    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m just wondering if anyone knows if the bcit student health plan covers diabetic supplies? I\u2019m a type 2 and I\u2019ve already tried emailing them before but they wouldn\u2019t give me a straight answer and said I\u2019d have to submit forms to Canada Life for pre approval. I am working full time currently and I\u2019m considering going back in a year or two, but I\u2019d lose my work health insurance which is a lot better than the student one.\n\nTIA",

            "comment": "I'm Type 1 and a full time BCIT student. Canada Life covers 80% of eligible medications. In my case that's Fiasp insulin, needles and test strips, and meds for thyroid and cholesterol. It does NOT cover Jardiance (oral diabetes med) nor Dexcom glucose sensors/transmitters. If you're wondering about specific meds I can find out for you via their site's coverage search.",

And glucometer strips/lancets (I use contour next one)? \n\nI know I don\u2019t meet provincial requirements for CGM coverage since I\u2019m not on insulin but being on dexcom has been great for monitoring my numbers in response to food. \n\nIs there like a separate category for diabetic supplies? My work insurance\u2019s drug card doesn\u2019t cover diabetic supplies for direct billing, you have to submit diabetic supply claims separately.\n\nThanks!",

You'll have to be more specific.\nLibre is not covered, nor any other sensors. Strips are covered (any items covered are at 80%). Overall, not great. I still rely on Pharmacare to cover my sensors and the 20% CanadaLife doesn't cover.",

After they first expire, remove the sensor from transmitter (I use 2 test strips jammed in the sides between the two to make it pop out), wait 15 mins, put back in, start sensor, enter 0000 as the code, and submit calibrations based on finger prick tests every day or so. Not as accurate but good enough to get trends, and nearly halves the cost.",

I might start extending sensors and stockpiling one sensor from each box of 3 so I can slowly build a stash of them. I know they aren\u2019t medically necessary for me but it\u2019s nice to not need to poke every single day. Hopefully I can build up a 2 year supply by the time I go back to school haha",

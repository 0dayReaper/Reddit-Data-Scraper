    "postText": "Little background of myself here. I am in my late 20s and have no relevant experience in the computer science field.\n\nI already have a Math degree from a decent university with a mediocre GPA of 2.97 and I have not taken any computer science courses. I realize that it was a poor decision and planning on my side to have not taken any computer science classes and hence I'm looking into post-degree programs. Currently, I have applied to following programs below.\n\nLangara (In process)\n\n[First Choice - Post degree Web and Mobile App Design and Development (Developer Stream)](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/web-and-mobile-app/program-curriculum.html)\n\n[Second Choice - Post degree Data Analytics](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/data-analytics/program-curriculum.html)\n\nDouglas (Accepted)\n\n[First Choice - Cybersecurity Stream, Second Choice - Emerging Technology Stream](https://www.douglascollege.ca/program/pbdcis)\n\nBCIT CST Program (Waitlisted at around 25 people ahead of me)\n\n[CST Program](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/#courses)\n\nI understand that BCIT is the best options out of the three however I am currently waitlisted and I am not sure if I could get in. I would not want to waste anymore time and would like to start in the January semester ultimately.\n\nI am also aware of the second degree computer science programs offered by SFU and UBC but was unfortunately rejected by them. I reckon that it would most likely be the case again even if I am to apply again for next September intake from these second degree programs.\n\nI am just wondering between the Douglas and Langara programs which one seems more career promising. Ideally, if the BCIT waitlist is going well and I am offered a seat, I would accept that with no hesitation.\n\nI have come up with some personal thoughts and questions about these two college's programs and would like to get some opinions about these programs' curriculum. Any suggestions are welcome too!\n\nLangara\n\n* Post degree Web and Mobile App Design and Development  \n\n   * The program seems to be very well rounded, however I am not sure if I am too interested in web development and I am not sure if the curriculum will be in depth enough to land me a job. On the bright side, there are 3 total integrated projects throughout the program and a co-op experience.\n* Post degree Data Analytics  \n\n   * The program seems very interesting and seems to be relatively Math heavy which I am quite interested in. However, it also has the same issues where I am not sure if the curriculum will be in depth enough to land me a job in that field and whether this career will be better than the Web and Mobile App Design and Development program. Another concern of mine is the job demand for this industry even though there is a co-op experience.\n\nDouglas\n\n* Cybersecurity  \n\n   * Seems like a very interesting branch as well, but the depth of the curriculum is concerning. Cybersecurity might be on the rise but I am not sure if that is also the case in the Vancouver region.\n* Emerging techology  \n\n   * Seems like a broader but less in depth version of Post degree Web and Mobile App Design and Development, but still does not seem like a bad program since it covers some courses that I believe will be important such as \"algorithms and data structure\" which Langara doesn't. This also poses the same issue with the depth of the curriculum.\n* On a side note, comparing to Langara, these programs only have 1 project while Langara has 3. This seems like a big deciding factor.\n\nI am wondering if transferring later will be a good idea, however, transferring to BCIT's CST program seems to be not appealing since it is stated that students coming from advanced Placement through transferring will not be allowed to join Co-op experience. I know not all CST students gets Co-op, but having that option removed surely will hurt my overall future opportunities. I still need to do more research about transferring to SFU second degree program.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for reading all this and any advice and suggestions are welcome! Especially what you guys think about their curriculum and whether or not I should gamble for BCIT 's offer while rejecting the offer from the other two places\n\n**TL;DR:  Waitlisted at 25th position at BCIT CST program, torn between which other options I should go for. Need some advice to see which of the programs' (links above) curriculum will be in depth enough to land me a job after in their specific stream/industry.**",

            "comment": "I would consider a part-time program at BCIT and start in January, no wait lists. The differences between CST Full-time and CST part-time are the costs (part-time courses are more expensive) and length (part-time program requires more credits). \n\nYou can take part-time courses at evenings and on weekends, it would allow you to work. Otherwise, you can take more courses and finish your program earlier. \n\nAlso, with Math degree, you can find a job as a software developer before you finish your program, when you'll have enough skills.",

I am at my late 20s at the moment and with the part time program it would likely take over around 4 years to complete. While I can be working full time and doing the program, it is not likely that I would be doing a relevant job in this industry while upgrading myself. Hence, I want to finish within 2 years and be stepping my foot in the industry first.",

Either continue working at your regular job and study part time.(cst can be done part time or many other certificates like data analytics etc).\n\noption 2 is to go straight into the certification route. Such as if you're into cybersecurity look into the SSCP or CISP. CCNA for networking etc. Main thing is rather than go back to school full time for an educational credential you already have you'll be earning and saving money too. BCIT courses also transfer poorly into SFU/UBC. I ended up doing the CIT program at bcit that said i had no other credential to my name at the time. If i already had a degree than another degree to me is pointless at the bachelors or diploma lvl. I would take part time classes and continue earning money and upgrading your resume skills.",

Aside from the mentioned certifications, do you happen to know any other good certifications? Likely in the developer side or machine learning side.",

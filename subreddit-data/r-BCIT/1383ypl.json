I guess there are too many students who study business, unless you get a CPA, CFA or something, otherwise, I guarantee your wage won't be over 22/hr, Especially you are an international student who does not have many working experience in Canada.",

A diploma in IT is way better than business. Or you can study their engineering programs, but the workload is very heavy, and courses are difficult.",

None of my BCIT classmates landed a high paying job. My cousin graduated from SFU, she ended up moving to another province. Another friend of mine had a SFU degree, he works as a part-time teller, others work as a \"financial advisor\" which I think it is a scam, commission based, pyramid selling.   \n\nOr you can work in an accounting firm, job is tedious, repetitive, no self-esteem, employer treats you like a slave.",

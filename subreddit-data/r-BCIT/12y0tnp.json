    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently a first-semester CIT student with an average of around 86. My goal is to do a co-op in CIT, but I applied to the CST department when I got into CIT and just received an acceptance email, which has left me uncertain about whether to attend.\n\nI'm not sure about my career goal yet, but I'm interested in web development. More than that, my ultimate goal is to go to a place with a high salary. I haven't explored the network or sysadmin areas yet, which may be the reason for my lack of interest in them.\n\nGoing to CST could be a better option for becoming a developer, but I've already invested a semester in CIT, and as an international student, the tuition for one semester (about $10,000) is prohibitively expensive. So I'm wondering if it's worth the opportunity cost to attend CST.\n\nIf I don't go to CST, another option I am considering is to continue with CIT, do a co-op, and then work full time upon graduation, and then apply for Btech. While I believe having a degree will be beneficial for salary negotiations and future opportunities, I have heard that some companies view Btech graduates as those who were unable to find a job after obtaining a diploma. This has made me question whether pursuing a Btech degree is worth the time and financial investment.\n\nLastly, I'm curious if there are any universities that offer bachelor's degrees that I could transfer to after graduating from CIT. To my knowledge, there aren't any such programs available, but I would appreciate any insight you may have.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "In my opinion, just stick with CIT since you are already in the program\n\nCST, as others say here, is targeted to Computer Science. To be more specific it is Applied Computer Science. CIT, on the other hand, is usually maintaining, deployment, and implementation software and hardware. \n\nMy cousin graduated CIT at BCIT and asked him about it. Based on my cousin's account I do agree with what others have said that it has enough courses to do web dev.\n\nYou have mentioned B-tech, starting fall it will not be B-tech anymore. It will now be Bachelor's of Science in Applied Computer Science (BScACS). If you plan to have your Bachelor's at BCIT then after CIT you will be taking some bridging courses. Some of the bridging courses that I know are as follows:\n- COMP 2511 - Procedural C\n- COMP 2825 - Computer Architecture\n- COMP 3725 - Data Communications\n- COMP 3761 - Algorithm Analysis and Design\n\nThere might be more depending on how they will asses you.",

It will give you some good fundamentals for web development and programming, and you will be in a decent position to get a development job when you're done.\n\nAs far as other schools letting you complete a bachelors with them after doing CIT/CST at BCIT I am unaware of any since the programs are so unique. Only BCIT will let you do the full b-tech after (2 more years of schooling for degree).",

                            "comment": "I'm definitely enjoying the program so far! The curriculum is more broad and not really specialized, but it gives you enough to cover almost everything in I.T except serious software development (I know people currently with co-op jobs for web dev, I.T. operations, a business analyst role, and even a junior C# dev).\n\nYou will learn alot, but you will still have to self study in areas you want to seek employment in, once you graduate. You will have a diploma, which is enough to start looking for entry-level jobs, just make sure you prep for resume fine-tuning and interviews (our two COMM courses helped with this).\n\nOverall, imho there is no better choice for an education in I.T. than CIT, so I definitely recommend it if you're willing to primarily work in I.T. operations or web dev. For software development, I'd probably say do CST **OR** be prepared to take the new BSc once you're done CIT.",

It doesn't really prepare you for operational roles.\n\nCIT is a mix of different courses, preparing you for systems administration, DevOps, web dev, but not for writing low-level code (you're not taught how to make low-level drivers, fix the Linux kernel, etc.).\n\nIt boils down to what you want to do. Technically you can do CIT and still be a software dev, or do CST and be a system admin, but for both cases you'll need to do some self study.",

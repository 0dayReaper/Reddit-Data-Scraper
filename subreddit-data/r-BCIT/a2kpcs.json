He's been posting shit about it on all the local post-secondary subs using an alt. \n\nFrom his post history, it sounds like he's never had to lift a finger in his life (he mentioned that he had a job once, but he quit because he prefers to stay at home and play Pokemon and expects to meet girls that way) and his parents are forcing him to go to school. We're lucky enough to get the resulting temper tantrum.",

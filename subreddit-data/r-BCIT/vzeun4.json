Like I checked BC transfer guide and only a few courses could transfer and it was really confusing but I feel like I could deal with that and study for a few more years. IDKKK",

Ubc isn\u2019t that special for business. I\u2019ve landed better jobs then my friends at ubc it\u2019s all about the individual person rather then the name of ur school.",

Or you have someone who's willing to sponsor $70 - 100K for 1.5 years.\n\nThe average person it'll cost$70 - 100K in Tuition$90 - 180K in Opportunity cost from now working 1.5 years.\n\nI think on average a Sauder student will make more and do better. Their upper end is better as well. But BCIT top 10% makes really good money and gets into most jobs as well.",

If you find a way to network w ppl in IB Im sure u can. Ubc doesn\u2019t have any exclusive knownledge, in fact I did the finance diploma and our profs are the same profs as sauder. And Ik a lot of sauder kids and when I talk finance w then they don\u2019t know any more then I do. There\u2019s only a handful of kids from sauder then get into IB anyways maybe 5-10. Rest go into same roles as a bcit grad would like wealth management or asset management or fp. Again degree may get you a conversation but that\u2019s about it rest relies on the individual person",

CFA Level I, CPA and for transparency I've never went to UBC. I've only looked up their courses in the past to how different our courses vs theirs were. I've also worked and met a lot of Sauder students in the last 3 years.   \n\n\nThe finance program does not put you anywhere near the level of breadth that UBC does. They have 10 - 30x the amount of courses that we have and the specialization they get is unreal. They had a class specifically for options and different levels.  If we exclude the international and some local Sauder kids that paid their way in, the upper 50% percentile is significantly smarter than BCIT grads across all subjects.  \n\n\nTo further add, I don't think &gt; 5- 10% of BCIT grad are getting into WM at an associate level, nor commercial banking, nor FP&amp;A. However, BCIT grads do on average go from a retail banking / big 4 up to that level we mentioned previously. In 10 - 15 years, yes we are almost all in similar places.  \n\n\nI just wanted to let other peeps who may fall on this post know the reality of BCIT. Yes, it's possible to make $100K+ in years 3 - 10 years post-grad. No, you're not likely to get into IB/MBB/Big4Consulting/FP&amp;A.",

You got this\n\nIf all fails Dell has good payment plans and couple other companies too\n\n*** if you buy a laptop yourself- do rebates! Last time I bought a laptop I got 200 bucks  back (Rakuten) on top of the sale they had - and used a cashback credit card for it too.... it's ok to be a savage shopper ( and Honey and other coupon apps for coupons) --- but if you use honey extention for coupons and find the best coupon, copy it and then disable Honey, so the Rakuten cashback percentage doesn't lock - it's usually either or - but you can technically use both.... \n\nSign up for all the companies promo emails for deals while you're in the market for one \n\nAll that being said, I hope you qualify for a free one - if not - use everyway to get money back, feel free to message me if you need more info",

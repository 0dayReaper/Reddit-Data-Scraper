    "postText": "Hi everyone.\n\nI've been bouncing back and forth many things as I'm about to graduate secondary and I'm planning to head into post secondary. I have been hearing alot people say Industrial instrumentation and process control technician is the way to go.\n\nI'm still thinking should I take it or not. My family kinda wants me to stay on the lower mainland near Vancouver so I have to also have to consider to work here too with this diploma if I were to enroll.\n\nBefore all of that though I want to make sure that I will complete the course successfully or my tuition money will go down the drain so I'm wondering if the program is hard or pretty straightforward.\n\nThanks for your time in helping a student.",

If you've got good study habits, are good at troubleshooting, and have an open mind, you shouldn't have too much trouble though.  It's a very fun program, the education is interesting, and the job opportunities are incredible out of the gates.",

                            "comment": "So for both the diploma and apprentice tracks, first term is fairly straight-forward.  30% final exam per-unit, 30% mid-unit tests, 20% lab marks, 10% assignment marks and 10% cumulative tests.\n\nA single semester, about 15 weeks, has several units in it.  Each one is isolated but builds on one another.  Cumulative tests however can contain questions on anything you\u2019ve studied since day one.\n\nOnce you get into term 2-3, there\u2019s an incoming exam, which covers anything from the previous terms.  IE: Term 2 incoming will cover anything in Term 1.  Term 3 incoming will cover anything from T1 and T2.  Term 4 similarly will cover anything from Term 1-3.\n\nTerm 4 is where things get a little different.  Your incoming exam goes from being worth 10% of the semester mark to 25% of the semester mark.  So if you aren\u2019t keeping up with studying material you\u2019ve already covered, it can really screw you over for Term 4.\n\nLabs are important, but just as equal are the tests.  What I will say is that the Labs are really your time to shine, and it\u2019s where the instructors figure out if you\u2019re a good student overall, or if you\u2019re just good at testing.  Don\u2019t be afraid to get your hands dirty and get in there with a tool or two.",

The red seal opens the next tear of opportunities. If you can get this and your electrical you basically get any job you want.",

You will have to move away to gain experience and progress your career. Most employers around the lower mainland will want several years of experience, so don't kid yourself thinking there's job opportunities right out of the gate.\n\nI'd recommend HVAC or Electrical as they have many more options as far as job potential.\n\nJust my two cents.",

Then after like 10 years you can become an independent contractor and make 150 to 200k once you buy a truck and calibration gear.\n\nInst guys make more then electricians generally. And it's far easier to start contracting as a Inst mechanic.\n\nPeople say living up north sucks. But I just bought a 3 bedroom house for 300k, and I'm only 27. So I think it's way better than working yourself to death in vancouver.",

            "comment": "Gabriel Vitus is a horrible teacher, especially 7510. He doesn\u2019t really know the content. His slides are blatantly incorrect on a technical level. And I\u2019m talking the real basic shit too. Doesn\u2019t know what an ephemeral port is, what ARP stands for, or what a MAC address is. Don\u2019t get me started on the fact that he has IP4v and IP6v in his slides (yes, that\u2019s not my typo, that\u2019s what\u2019s in his slides). He doesn\u2019t understand the components of a URL or URI. \n\nAnd he\u2019s a rude cunt too. Just look up his reviews on line for bcit and Douglas college on ratemyprof or whatever it is. Despite being so technologically ignorant he doesn\u2019t take any feedback. As far as he\u2019s concerned he\u2019s right, your wrong, and fuck off. \n\nI would avoid his classes like the plague. I\u2019m not sure if Ilia teaches 7510, I think he does sometimes, but that guy is actually competent and knows what he\u2019s teaching. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not just like bitter or something. I passed his class just fine. But in all my years at BCIT, this guy has got to be the most incompetent instructor I\u2019ve had. 100% would not take any class he\u2019s teaching.",

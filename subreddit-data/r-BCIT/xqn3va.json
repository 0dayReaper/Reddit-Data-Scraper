    "postText": "I've been accepted into BCIT CST for the January intake.  I'm still unsure whether it would be better to take the 2 year program, or try the self teaching route for someone in my position (STEM degree holder).  How good is the CST program for teaching hands on programming that will be useful in the real world?  I'm wondering if I might do better just learning on my own/ trying to do something like The Odin Project, and studying data structures and algorithms on my own for interviews.  \n\nDoes BCIT CST have much \"fluff\"?  Mostly I'm worried about having to learn a bunch of stuff that's not actually useful for real world work.",

Brings in lots of practical things and relatively quick program in comparison to CS degrees. Its nice that if you finish the program you get a stamp of \u201cthey are able to contribute as a developer\u201d seal for vancouver. \n\nPersonally i believe you will be bored at CST but if you dont have an easy way to enter professionally into the field then BCIT isnt a bad one",

For example All the math courses are going to be boring because you must have covered the stats in second year of your degree but you are commited to 4 hours of classroom time + take home work time. Web dev isn\u2019t exactly exhilarating either and the delivery was abysmal when i took it. \n\nI personally find the workload of cst to be average. You get assigned a volume of homework that makes it tedious rather than anything that is difficult to solve.",

So far I\u2019m finding it pretty straight to the point (minimal fluff) and there is an emphasis on projects, which is nice to build your portfolio. It\u2019s also only 9 months long - more like an extended boot camp. Let me know if you any questions about SSD. For reference, I\u2019m hoping to get a job as a dev for an Ed-tech company",

It's very straight to the point, and I would say 80% of things I've learned there so far I've either used directly, or provided context for me at my coop.  You don't necessarily have to complete the program either to land a job.  I know of people who finished their coop term and then went straight into the workforce.\n\nJust an add on: if you've completed a previous degree and there's some overlap, you could apply for a credit so you don't have to take those classes again.",

            "comment": "I started with self learning and quickly learned that I didn\u2019t have the discipline (or time) for it, so CST was a good option for me. It does still require discipline and you\u2019ll get out of CST what you put into it, meaning it requires hard work and dedication to succeed. Phoning it in is a waste of time and money. But usually more mature students can handle this easily, so you\u2019re in good shape already.\n\nYou might be able to actually get credit for some of the math classes (and maybe others) so you could possibly skip classes that are repeats for you. As for \u201cfluff\u201d, I would say that yes there is, but it\u2019s not much. There\u2019s a business analysis class that I mostly found boring and a computers and the law class that I thought was interesting but not super applicable. There may be others if the curriculum has changed.\n\nCST is awesome for teaching you how to work collaboratively (yay git!) on a project using various languages. You do that from term 1. You do it in co-op. You do it in the industry sponsored projects in terms 3 and 4. They all give you awesome experience you can draw upon to talk about in interviews on top of stuff to put on your resume. And they help with your networking skills, which in my eyes is the most important tool in your toolbox. A referral from someone at a company is worth just so much.\n\nGood luck!!",

    "postText": "Hi guys! I have a few questions about the bcit nursing program. When do I submit the final high school marks for Math and chem 11? Because I am currently finishing them online and will be done June 29 and the BSN application deadline is July 15. And I am wondering how do they look at all of our credits? Do we submit each individual course or do they look at our entire transcripts (I\u2019ve taken prerequisites at Bcit, Capilano, and langara) I have around 28 credits but unfortunately I have two fails on my transept which I don\u2019t want them to see. Do you think I still have a chance of getting in? And what was your bcit admissions experience if so. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you!!!",

I don't know about the CASper, other health program such as nuclear medicine and MRI programs do not weight CASper grade too heavily. Langara cut off 3.70. VCC 3.50. I know someone got in BCIT nursing with a GPA 3.5 as well. I am not sure about the high school grades, I think midterm grades on High School portion is acceptable. \n\nYou submit each individual course grade, but you also need to fill a questionnaire form which it asks your overall GPA. You also need to upload pdf of your official transcript.",

If you and another applicant have similar GPA on the pre-requisites, then BCIT would select one who has more credits and relevant experience. I know someone got accepted with less then 30 credits, but her grades were very high. I think, GPA&gt;working experience&gt;Casper&gt;# of credits",

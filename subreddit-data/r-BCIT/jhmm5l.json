He has many more as well but these are the lists that I know of for sure.\n\nLiterally this guy's been spending the last 2 years trashing places like BCIT/McMaster/Ryerson for being \"2nd tier\" universities. He literally monitors every single university subreddit and posts his hate comments every chance he can get. He even makes fake \"Is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ school good? Will I find a job even if it's a second tier shit university? Why would any employer hire grads from these shit university\" so that he can use his alt accounts to answer it.\n\nI'm pretty sure he's suffering from some kind of mental illness. He deleted the post where he once revealed that he's some 30 year old making min. wage who is trying to go to school to get a career..\n\nOn certain days, he asks relatively neutral questions like \"Is BCIT Mechanical engineering good? I've been accepted to the program. Can the grads find a job?\" But other days, his alter ego wins over and he goes on a rampage about how BCIT/McMaster/etc are trash schools and no one will literally hire any grads from there.\n\nIt's kind of both sad and interesting to look at. My interpretation is that he wants to go to back to school but obviously can't go to places like UofT, but he's too good for places like BCIT. So instead, he makes these hate posts against BCIT/McMaster so he can feel better about himself not going. It's a battle against his cognitive dissonance. I'm pretty sure this guy needs therapy.\n\nSharing because if you've been wondering what all the \"IS BCIT ENGINEERING GOOD? HOW DO EMPLOYERS LOOK AT IT? HOW CAN THEY FIND A JOB WHEN THERE ARE UBC/SFU GRADS\" threads were about, now you know that it's all made by him.",

Seems like a random group of schools to hate. I think he trashes Carleton too but BCIT and McMaster are highest on his list.  \n\n\nProper legend, that one",

You should realize that your relatives only turned out to be unwanted and unsuccessful because they only went to BCIT for the money and free job. But they realized life doesn't handout freebies like that unless you work your ass off. So they decided to cry and talk shit about the school they couldn't be successful in.\n\nSounds a lot like you actually. Only the unwanted and unsuccessful part. I hope one day you will realize mommy can't pay for your food and living expenses anymore so you actually have to do something useful in life rather than being a waste of oxygen and human resources.",

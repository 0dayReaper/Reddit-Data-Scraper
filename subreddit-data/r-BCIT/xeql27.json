Not sure if it's the same now but we also had a week of welding practice which was cool since you won't learn that with a plumbing company. \nI did find the 6 months to be long and thought it could be condensed into a shorter length. Still happy I went I went thru it rather than starting with a company right away.",

If you know you want to be a plumber I'd suggest just trying to get an apprenticeship as you'll be paid while you learn. 6months is a long time for this course. We had a lot of downtime. Was a good experience for me though as I wasn't sure what trade to pursue.",

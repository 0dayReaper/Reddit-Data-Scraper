Most of my peers were able to land decent paying jobs right after graduating.  Getting in coop can help a lot with this.\n\nMy biggest recommendation if you do get into CST is to pick your option wisely.  The actual course content you do doesn\u2019t matter much, but some of the option heads did not run their programs well.\n\nIf you plan on pursuing a degree, I would recommend avoiding BCIT as well.  You\u2019ll get a better education at SFU or UBC, and if you transfer later you may have to repeat some courses.",

Took me 8 months after graduation to land a low paying job (40k). I was close to applying for a program at BCIT while job searching. I heard the class sizes are smaller and the teachers take attendance and actually know you by name and grads get jobs.",

They might know you by name, but they don't necessarily know what they're teaching, especially in introductory courses. You've got teachers that create their own content that are blatantly incorrect, and some teachers that read from slides/documents that other instructors have created. And then you've got some that actually know what they're talking about.   \n\n\nsrc: Have a bachelors degree in CS from a different university, currently a software developer - but have taken a bunch of BCIT courses (about 20?) over the years for various reasons.",

Others just read off of slides and expect you to understand everything. A lot of the courses are more theory though. There\u2019s only about 5 courses that are relevant to my career (also software dev).",

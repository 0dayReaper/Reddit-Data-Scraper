    "postText": "Silly me, decided to take this hilarious English test that would give me my results in two days. Fair enough, huh? Wrong!\n\nThe first time, they told me that an application was open during the exam. I said fine. The next time, I closed every single possible process, terminated all of the tray apps and then sat for the test. Next thing I receive is that my face wasn't always visible, throughout the exam! What the actual hell? I was completely watching myself throughout the exam, from the image frame inside the application and I was 100000% of the time inside the frame. What happened then? They took my credit from me on the second attempt and told me to buy another test if I want the results. I had purchased 2 test so I sat for the third one. Again, they messaged me that an application was open. First of all, why do you have to take two days to tell me about this? It's pretty easy to notify the user that an app is running when they want to start the test, so that they can terminate it and be fine! Nope, that doesn't happen. Secondly, I'm a programmer and I exactly know how processes and everything works. They can't just say that! I knew that there was nothing running. I checked every process and terminated them. I contacted the online support and they said, \"Oh, sorry! We can't help you with that. You can retake your second test that you've purchased.\" I insisted that I've been waiting for my results for two bloody weeks and the dealines are going to be in a week and I'm going to miss them because of this trash test. They said we can't help and they had the audacity to close the chat on me! This is hilarious.\n\nI'm going to miss this year's intakes and I'm absolutely devastated. Don't waste your time and money and mental health on this absolute scam. They don't properly answer your questions and they always think they're right. They're taking us all as jokes. I insist, please don't take this test. If you are in a hurry, you'd better sit for an IELTS CD test so that you can receive it in 5 days.\n\nGood luck everyone and I hope Duolingo vanishes as soon as possible.\n\nUPDATE:\nThey messaged me to tell me that they can't do anything about the test and it has to be taken again.\nI challeneged them to tell me the name of the app that was running. They were talking all the time but as soon as I mentioned this in my email, they stopped replying. Scam approved!",

If your test isn\u2019t certified because you had another program open, temporarily delete all the messenger apps and Microsoft teams. \nMake sure to lock the door of your room so that no one can come to your room.\nAlso keep your head straight throughout the exam because if you move it too much, it won\u2019t be certified.\n\nAs you said this test is an absolute exam, but if your in a hurry, these are my tips.",

If they give you the name, then check if it's running in the background or Uninstall it if possible. Check your task manager to see what other apps are running. It could be system application that's running and they're picking it up as \"an app\". That's why it's very important to know the name of the app they claim was running.",

The live support told me that they don't have the information that I need and the test supervisors should help me. The supervisor emailed me and repeated the same thing that I had an app running. I again asked them to tell me the name of the app or process that was running but they didn't get back to me! I again contacted the live support that your supervisors aren't getting back to me. They said they'll let the supervisors know about the issue again. I'm still waiting for a proper response.\n\nAs I mentioned, I booted up on safe mode and ran two drivers for the camera and the mic and then started the test so there would be no apps running. It's unacceptable.",

But I doubt they'll want t refund all of your exam attempts. Usually reputable companies will have no problem refunding you or giving you some kind of credit, but to deny you and be uncooperative is not something a good company would do. Sounds more like a scam.",

They won't give a refund as they said that the final decision has been made and now my $78 is gone and I've missed the deadline. I thought that as different institutions accept this exam, it's a reasonable one to sit for. I did some research and I saw that people are saying that the exam has been a pleasant experience for them. As soon as I started to be more explicit about the situation, I saw that thousands of people have been reporting these kind of issues. It's a shame.",

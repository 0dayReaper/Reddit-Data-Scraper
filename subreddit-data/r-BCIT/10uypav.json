Ask a lot of questions and stay open to any opportunities. \n\nThere may be projects that piss you off, or instructors that piss you off even more, but the better you adapt to a difficult situation and deliver what's asked of you the better suited you'll be for the industry tbh lol\n\nI managed to land an in house internship and am now working a prepress position. Not exactly where I want to be, but it's chill work and pays alright.",

I'm planning on leaving Van after the course so I guess it doesn't matter that much but I'm wondering how much value the certificate will add to a resume outside of the lower mainland? Obviously it's at least slightly better than nothing. Hopefully. Because the money has been spent.",

But some instructors are open to keeping in touch so it's more on you, your goals and work ethic to make those. If you get Omar Amini as an instructor, he's a great point of reference to answer questions.\n\nUnfortunately BCIT caters more to the degree and diploma students, but it is useful enough within the lower mainland. I can't speak to the outside.",

Also graphic design is such a saturated market in Vancouver so because of that, I want you give it a try by yourself first. If money isn\u2019t a problem for you, go ahead and try their program. It will definitely be faster to learn at school, but be aware for a heavy competition and a low wage to start in the industry. \n\nAre you type of person who is willing to learn by yourself? Try it at home for 3 months before paying your precious tuition money.",

The OP is interested in Graphic Design and to get a job in this industry, having a good portfolio is everything and more important than getting certificate or diploma. Learning how to code is beneficial as a designer, but getting into CST is not necessary unless you want to work as a developer, especially people who are into creative field. \n\nLike my comment, I suggest OP to try learning both graphic design and coding using online resources and see if you like it or not. If you do and can handle learning by yourself, try applying for jobs with your portfolio by getting feedback from online community. If you have a hard time learning by yourself, take the certificate program.",

Having a good portfolio, and resume, does play a major role in getting jobs, but also learning from an institute, and having a diploma would offer a lot more resources and options. CST, im just saying would open a lot more branches for him. It all depends on him, and what type of jobs he's expecting in life. I know this because I have a friend, who did the diploma program at BCIT for Graphic Design. They helped him build his portfolio and a good resume. Now he is making 130K as a Graphic design leader.",

True, having a school on a resume stands out and gives you a higher chance to get hired than self-taught people. But still portfolio is No.1 in this field and your friend is one of the rare cases as most do not earn that much, which requires years of experience and luck. I am telling OP to put a lot of thoughts into it since he/she asked before getting into the program. I am telling that graphic design is something you do not need to go to school like most of the art programs. Of course going to school gives you an edge, but it is worth considering to study on your own before paying tuitions you might regret spending as I have seen so many people struggle after graduation.",

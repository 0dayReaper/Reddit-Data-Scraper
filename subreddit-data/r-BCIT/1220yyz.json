    "postText": "CST graduate here.  I just wanted to wish you all good luck, have fun with your time in BCIT. It's really a good program and great career to be in. \n\nWhen you start your program, don't mind people saying its too hard. There is always going to be people complaining about the school, teachers, and subjects. I finished the program successfully with my broken english so its very doable. \n\nThe program might require you to invest a lot of your off school hours but believe me, it wont take too long to get the benefits when you start your career.\n\nIf you end up learning C from Albert Wei, be patient with him. He is a legend imo \ud83d\ude04",

            "comment": "Albert is no longer teaching C, he's the option head for Programming Paradigm (yes, the option I'm taking now).\n\nHe is teaching 1 functional language in T3 (OCaml) and 3 languages in T4 (Elixir, Go, and Rust) + one web framework (phoenix). So basically he's teaching 4 languages at the same time which he just learned by himself in recent years, at the age of 80.\n\nI love him. He is super smart and super cool.\n\nBut don't take this option if you're not mentally prepared. We started with 25 in T3 and in T4 only 18 survived,  and according to Albert only 8 students out of 12 graduated from this option last term.",

I think it was mostly about getting prepared to interviews, doing leetcode and understanding how to stand out with a good written resume. Additionally, a lot of experienced programmers were applying low grade jobs to have some sort of income. There was always a better candidate than me.\n\nCompanies care about specific skill sets and not overall coding knowledge. Learning widely used tools probably helped more than anything. I landed a full stack job with my understanding of express, postgresql, react and microservices.\n\nI gotta say tho, after my first job things got easier.",

Make sure you master it  by the time you start learning java, because they share a lot of oop concepts. You should be fine. In terms of teachers, it mostly up to you to decide how far you wanna push your education. Teachers are not the bottleneck.",

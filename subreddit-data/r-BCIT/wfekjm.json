    "postText": "Wondering if anyone done the Assayer program through BCIT ONLINE. How long do it take to complete the program online? It says 1-2 years but could you do it quicker then that? I did a course online through TRU and it was a 2 year course but I managed to finish it in 8 months wondering if this course is the same? And if there\u2019s jobs around and is the pay good?\nThank you!",

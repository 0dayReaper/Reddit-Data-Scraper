    "postText": "I'm currently filling out the medical insurance assessment form and I have some questions from the more experienced international students about the way that insurance works for us.\n\nThe `Guard.me` insurance is temporary until we're eligible for MSP coverage. Am I correct about this?\n\nMy question is what would be the more reasonable insurance option for international students? What is this `MSP` coverage all about? Is it a provincial insurance and how does it differ from private insurance?\n\nAre there any additional steps that are supposed to be taken to make sure that I'll receive proper insurance after my waiting time for `MSP`? (Based on what I've heard, that would be around 3 months?)",

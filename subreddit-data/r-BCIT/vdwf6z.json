    "postText": "*Quick background: Grad from UBC 2018 w/ a pretty niche bachelors, couldn't find related work, still can't. Worked the last 3 years as an even more niche office/WFH type job (100% unrelated to degree). Quit a few months ago. Overall, just a boring, low pay &amp; pretty unskilled job. But it was easy and came with a lot of freedom (most of which went untapped during COVID).*\n\nI'd like to take a program at BCIT, I've done a lot of research &amp; reading, but just can't commit. I'd say the programs on the techier side of \"Trades &amp; Apprenticeships\" &amp; \"Engineering\" categories interest me the most on paper, there is a lot of overlap between those topics &amp; my personal values/hobbies/interests. But, I've no real background/experience in any of this &amp; it seems you can easily bite off more than you can chew in these fields of work (*i.e. grind in proper construction for years when you naively thought you'd be playing with pretty little models &amp; diagrams*). Just trying to be realistic, to not be the office-guy getting romantic about hands on work.\n\nAny advice welcome, but specifically wondering if anyone has any experience with this stuff: [https://www.bcit.ca/advising/career-exploration-courses/](https://www.bcit.ca/advising/career-exploration-courses/)\n\nMy gut reaction is that these types of things can be a bit gimmicky &amp; I need to ultimately work this out myself, but reading countless anecdotes from people in different fields on the internet is sending me in circles. Want to narrow this down!",

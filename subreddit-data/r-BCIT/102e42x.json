Got into the CISA program, but am worrying cause am not too sure if I want to do hardware or work with systems. Any suggestions? I can do the work but if it is complex or tough to understand, that\u2019s a no.",

IT and software are fields that require critical thinking and ability to work through complex stuff. That\u2019s where the value is going to be at in these fields. All the easy tasks that you can just do will be automated a lot quicker in the future. Try your best and every challenging experience will grow you as an individual",

IT has a lot of problem solving so you'll need to get comfortable and not be overwhelmed.",

Nothing in life is certain, you don't always get what you give and life can be very unforgiving at times and you will experience challenging and complex situations regardless of what you do with your life. Steering a car to the right direction is easier if it's already moving, but a car that is just idle doing nothing will be a lot more difficult to moves towards any direction. Sometimes taking the right direction requires taking the wrong path but I guarantee none of life's experiences will be wasted.\n\nHardware isn't a bad gig, at my workplace there's a guy who does the hardware installations for all IT related stuff and he gets to play with some of the newest tech products. If you land yourself a good employer, I'd imagine it could be pretty fun. But hardware products are constantly upgrading, so I'm not sure if that's something you'll have to consider? How do you stay updated with the latest tech? I guess same as software people?",

If u have no prior knowledge of the topics like I did, it is sorta hard to understand but once u do it's easy and u will be able to do it on ur head. If u have any more questions, lmk I am a CISA student and I just completed the 1st term",

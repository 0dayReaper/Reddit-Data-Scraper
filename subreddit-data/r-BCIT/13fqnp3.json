    "postText": "Hi currently in 12th grade doing high school here in bc, however my score\u2019s isn\u2019t enough as I just moved to bc last year in 2022 , hence the sudden change in environment has significantly impacted my education. Therefore, I decided to join the technology entry program first and I have no idea what program to do next. So it was a win win but I really have to think of one. I was thinking of CST since I used to be interested in computers and technology however I completely lost interest in it.",

A lot of grads are in that position. \n\n\nYou should take the time to figure that out. Reflect on your goals, aptitude, and desired lifestyle, and take the time to seriously weigh out your options. Think about the courses that you enjoy taking right now, or that you're good at, and see if there are related careers that interest you. Literally look up current job postings for interesting careers and see what sort of credentials employers are looking for. \n\n\n\n You're still in high school, right? Consider setting up an appointment with a guidance counsellor and asking for some help with career planning. Speak with academic advisors in target postsecondary institutions for solid advice on how to set yourself up for success with them. If you change your mind mid-program, that's totally fine.",

    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI've been accepted to BCIT in the fall for the Marketing Management Diploma Program. I've heard that this school is really difficult and that time management is really important with there being so many courses each semester. I want to set myself up for success and I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on time management with the course load and how to succeed without burning out. \n\nAny advice is welcome! \n\nI want to make sure I'm ready to face this program with all my strength and hopefully some good habits formed before I start!\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "1. Prioritize school. Expand from there if you feel able. Lowest workload periods are in the first couple weeks after a class starts, and immediately after midterms or finals/between classes.\n\n2. Where possible(group projects can be hell) get things done early, not late.\n\n3. If possible, get your set communicating with each other, helping each other out with issues(not cheating), discussing problems or exams, bitching about particular assignments or instructors.\n\n4. Ask questions. During class, after class, talk to your instructor. *Make sure you understand what they're teaching.*\n\n5. Find time to relax and enjoy yourself. (School clubs can be a thing, but so can simply doing other things unrelated to BCIT.)\n\n6. Be aware generally of your grades and how the work in each course is weighted and what's required. Something you're struggling with and wasting a lot of time on might be something you can simply blow off and focus on half a dozen other things that need your attention and will impact you far more.",

            "comment": "I did the CST (computer programming) program about 10 years ago. There was about a 55% fail/dropout rate over 2 years. I made it out with honours. Here is some advice in no order:\n\n\\- Do you have subscriptions to any MMO RPGs? Cancel them. Do you play any competitive online games? Uninstall them. They are huge time sinks and will eat away at your grades. (I'm not saying you can't play ANY games, but single player, turn based games that you can just pick up and play for 15 minutes and then stop and get back to work are best).\n\n\\- Get really good at turning down social engagements. I didn't see my family for about 5 months when I started BCIT. I didn't go to family dinners or birthdays or things like that. Spending 6 hours out of a weekend travelling and hanging out, was just time I didn't have to spare.\n\n\\- At the start of the semester you'll get a syllabus that has the dates of all your projects, tests, and presentations. Take all of those and compile them into a single master document. Now you can see all your obligations for the semester. Three tests on one day? Better start studying three days in advance.\n\n\\- Become set rep if you can, because it gives you access to teachers and groups.\n\n\\- Get really tight with your set. You want people around you who are smart and helpful. BE a smart and helpful person. Share notes with people and ask them to help back.\n\n\\- When it's time to group up for projects, be the person who asks people to join your group. Show initiative. You never want to be in the 'left overs' group.\n\n\\- A lot of people think of their score starting at 0% and then they earn marks and try to finish high. Flip your mindset. You start the semester at 100%. Every assignment you don't turn in brings your marks down. Every quiz question you skip brings your grades down. Fight for every percent.",

It\u2019s definitely a lot you\u2019ll be stressed and your going to really have to learn to juggle a lot at once but it\u2019s not as bad as people make it out to be.\n\nA couple things I\u2019d recommend:\n\n1. Don\u2019t work while your in BCIT if it\u2019s an option your going to need 100% for school and you won\u2019t have any time for rest if you also have to balance a job.\n\n2. Clubs are a ton of extra work if you want more to do they can provide some unique experiences but for me and many others they become very taxing as the year goes on.\n\n3. Watch those final projects. Your going to have 3 big presentations if you take the communications option 1 in your first year and they are significantly more work than anything else you\u2019ll be asked to do. If you get ahead on then you\u2019ll be okay but the crunch if you fall behind is brutal.\n\nI hope this helps Marketing management is a great program and the profs are really solid so do your best and work hard.",

(I dropped from honours to just below by the time I finished, though felt it was good to create a club. As you say, it gives people new experiences and opportunities.)\n\nIf you're joining a club rather than running one, look for one that's flexible around your availability, not one that you have to schedule to participate in.",

Do you think working weekends is possible or a pretty bad idea? I know I definitely couldn't do more than that but I have been debating whether or not to get another job now and save more or just work weekends. \n\nI do have a few questions, if you don't mind! \n\nIs there a lot of group projects and how have you found the group projects to be? \n\nAlso, how did the schedule look for you in first year? I was imagining it being 8-5 Monday to Friday. Also, do you do all 7-8 courses throughout the semester, or are they split up so you do 3-4 for half of the semester and the rest of the courses for the last half of the semester? \n\nThank you again!",

Obviously pull your weight though not just because it\u2019s the reasonable thing to do but students will have opportunity\u2019s to grade their teammates several times.\n\nFirst year\u2019s schedule wasn\u2019t too bad class wise even with 7 at once you won\u2019t have more than 25 hours of class each week. It\u2019s the projects and studying that make up the real time sinks. Each semester has 7 classes so you\u2019ll be doing around 13-14 per year (some carry over more than one semester).",

            "comment": "I think the advice in here is pretty good. Treat BCIT like a full time job and put in at least 40 hours a week, every week. Keep your sanity and get some sleep, exercise, and don't consume junk.\n\nFollow PPT - plan, prioritize, and triage. Plan out your term by having your classes, tutorials, labs, assignments, exams, and project deadlines in your calendar with reminders set. Prioritize by focusing on harder courses, courses with high credit weighting, and graded components with high weighting (this is also exam strategy, complete the highest weighted components and leave the small stuff until the end). Triage by realizing that there are diminishing returns to your efforts (your assignments don't need to be perfect). \n\nI don't see anyone mentioning it, but what I found very useful was some concepts from psychology and education. Things like deliberate practice, spaced repetition, repeated testing, Bloom's taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, create), chunking, mastery learning. There are others, but a start might be to read up on some of those topics. Read up on some study habits and other lessons from top students.\n\nLast is how to game the exams and the material. \n\nIf you're going to be given a cheat sheet, practice with your sheet when you study or do assignments. If you don't have any and there are formulas you need to remember, spend some time committing those to memory. Instructors will sometimes be helpful and willing to share the format of exams, so that can help with studying. \n\nWhat I mean by gaming the material is figuring out if the material builds through the course (is dependent) or if it's independent. If the material builds, you can't fall behind because early topics will be expected to be known and mastered. If the material is independent, you can move on if you're getting stuck and come back later on. But dependent material requires you to go to office hours or use Google to clear up misunderstandings quickly. \n\nThe last thing is to go at your own pace. Some people may say that some topic is easy or put up a front of you don't need to study. Ignore them and do what you need to do to be successful.\n\nBCIT is difficult, but people do succeed. Good luck!",

I believe there's more to the school experience than sacrificing your mental health and life outside of studying to graduate faster. The full time programs at BCIT are like a version of Squid Game. Do you really want to suffer when there are other ways?",

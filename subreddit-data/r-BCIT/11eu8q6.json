I was in the Fine Arts program then and so it had a lot of group critiques, feedback sessions and studio time so a lot of people in the program spent a lot of time together and it was naturally a lot easier to make friends and socialize - it really felt like you were pretty decently acquainted with everyone in the program if you weren't already friends! I didn't make any friends in my academic classes at Langara tho. I'm enrolled in Flexible Learning over at BCIT and so the bulk of my classes are super late at night and so it's a little tougher to socialize since everyone's pretty beat by the time class starts since it's so late in the day and we all have to leave right after class since the campus closes at the same time. I've made a couple casual friends in my program but nothing too tight yet since it's my first sem.",

I believe there's more to the school experience than sacrificing your mental health and life outside of studying to graduate faster. The full time programs at BCIT are like a version of Squid Game. Do you really want to suffer when there are other ways?",

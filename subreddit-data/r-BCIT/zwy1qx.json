The industry in Vancouver is huge and you can work as a Production Assistant with essentially zero experience and work your way up from there. \n\nDepending on what you wanna do in the long run you should check out the website of the DGC, IATSE 891 and ICG 669. All of them are different unions for different departments, you can find a list of which departments fall under which union on their websites.",

Makes a huge difference, not to mention the ease of getting your foot in the door in a big operation with a practicum.",

It's all personal preference I would say, but I don't like that film school and film courses always get portraited as the ultimate way to get into film. 90% of the people I met in film who went to film school say it's an absolute waste of money and I've met a lot in the past 5 years. Again tho, it really depends on what one wants to do in film, but for most of it a degree is unnecessary.",

Or they need immediate camera and sound operations.\n\nIf you have no connections, then school helps you at least get projects together and and a portfolio out.\n\nIf you're talking about winning an Emmy, or getting a production job at Disney or HBO, then no, your degree doesn't matter that much.  That said, those companies are full of people from impressive universities.\n\n&gt;No shame in watching the parking lot, if you have a good attitude you won't do that for long anyway. \n\nIf someone has professional level skill in video editing, and they have interest in video editing, I don't see how watching the parking lot with a bunch of other people watching the parking lot helps them.",

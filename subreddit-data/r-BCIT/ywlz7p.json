    "postText": "How competitive is it getting into this program straight out of high school?  I am currently in grade 12, and I don't consider myself extremely smart, I usually get marks in the 80s and maybe low 90s.  I'm also wondering what are some other options if I don't get accepted.  I am thinking get an associate or bachelor degree in science before applying again.",

You are competing against 300+ applicants for less than 100 spots. I think there are maybe 3 people straight out of high school and not many more without any post-secondary. 90% of my group already has a bachelors degree of some sort. \n\nThat being said, it is definitely worth a shot! My grades were worse than yours and I was still accepted into the program. Good grades are only part of the acceptance process, the main decision is made off of the interview.",

I would suggest taking a medical terminology course beforehand, it can be quite useful, maybe a basic anatomy course. It is pretty competitive to get in, I was on the waiting list and just managed to squeeze in, but my marks weren't the greatest. There will be an interview of sorts and a competency quiz thing, but nothing too difficult. Don't have much else to offer unfortunately, good luck!",

            "comment": "Most students enter the program with a Bachelor\u2019s already (maybe 90%). Only a handful in my cohort came with only high school experience. I personally had two years undergrad before deciding to switch to this program. People with only high school backgrounds do tend to struggle with the content and workload as this program is very intense so even some post secondary experience will be VERY helpful (first two years of a biology degree is the most relevant tbh). I think its worth applying but you can always reapply again if it doesn\u2019t work out the first try.",

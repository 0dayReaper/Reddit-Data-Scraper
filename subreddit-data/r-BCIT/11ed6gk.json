I got here at 6am(cause i am an early nerd)\n\nLastest student had to walk from burnaby hospital because the bus kicked everyone off, and the latest student was here by 745(start time 730)\n\nIt is NOT bad, even out at my house in deroche, roads remain clear and it is now raining, which is clearing the roads even more.",

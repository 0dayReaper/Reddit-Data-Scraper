I went to reserve a spot on casper but it said \"There are currently no tests available based on your selections above. Please modify your selections or reach out to [support@acuityinsights.app](mailto:support@acuityinsights.app) if you have further questions\" what does this mean? Any help would be great! Thanks.",

All supporting documents must be submitted by the application deadline, with the exception of Casper test results. See the Casper website for the final test date for each intake.\" So I don't think the casper test needs to be completed prior to the application to the program. \n\n(I am doing September intake of 2024)",

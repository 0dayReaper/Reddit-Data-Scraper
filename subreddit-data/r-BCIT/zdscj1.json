    "postText": "Hi, does anyone know the best phone number or email to reach the health sciences department at BCIT? I'm trying to check everyday if any spots open up for BHSC 1200 next semester, and someone told me that I could also try contacting the department if they'll possibly open up another classes or a spot. I tried googling their contact information but couldn't find exactly which number is best to call about this. If anyone knows that would be great or even if anyone has any advice for getting into BHSC 1200! Thank you so much :)",

    "postText": "I was homeschooled from grade 4 on so going to BCIT is pretty cool for me. Just being here I feel really happy to be doing something with my life instead of wasting away at a dead end job. The other students I've met seem indifferent if not outright annoyed to be here, which is pretty surprising. I'm having a blast, I thought it would be easier to meet people though. I should have known students at a school would be too busy studying... duh!",

    "postText": "I was recently admitted to the BCIT Computer Systems Technology diploma program (2 yrs long). I was also rejected from the UBC Bachelor of Computer Science (2 yrs long as well) this year. I have a previous BSc in Biology from UBC. I was just wondering what the differences in career outcomes would be between completing the diploma at BCIT vs getting a proper bachelors at UBC. The two big factors are degree vs diploma and BCIT vs UBC (in terms of recognition). \n\nWith just the CST diploma, I am concerned about the following: \n1) I may be limited in terms of the CS fields I can realistically work in.\n2) I may be ineligible/very uncompetitive for senior positions in the long-term.\n3) I may have significantly limited access to jobs at higher profile companies including those outside of BC and Canada (e.g. FAANG). \n4) The diploma may give me significantly weaker and less-enduring knowledge of CS fundamentals than the alternative. \n\nI also wanna add that it seems to me that in CS, a formal bachelors is not 100% necessary to do a lot of things given the amount of self-learning and personal projects you can do. I'm just trying to understand what significant limitations exist with just the BSc Bio + diploma vs a second CS degree. While a lot of things may be theoretically possible, I also want to get a sense of practical and realistic expectations to have with the CST diploma. \n\nI guess ultimately I'm trying to assess all of this so I can decide whether it would be worthwhile to not attend the CST this year and reapply to the UBC BCS next year in hopes of improving my career outcomes. Alternatively, maybe I can learn some strategies on how to make the best of the diploma and bridge any gap between it and the degree. \n\nThanks for your time and for reading this!\u00a0",

            "comment": "I was in this same position a little over a year ago and ended up going into CST. Had I waited a year to take another shot at UBC, I would've continued working in a field I disliked while clumsily self-learning CS, all with the very real possibility I wouldn't be successful in a second attempt without upgrading several post-sec courses. Re: your concerns:\n\n&gt; 1) I may be limited in terms of the CS fields I can realistically work in.\n\nI would think the opposite; CST gives you in-the-trenches experience with a number of languages, capstone projects, and general CS theory. If anything, you're getting a broad education with a 4th term spec and all the tools to learn whatever you want from that point onward.\n\n&gt; 2) I may be ineligible/very uncompetitive for senior positions in the long-term. \n\nIn the long-term, no one will care whether you graduated from UBC or BCIT; they'll care about your continuous learning and pure work experience. If by senior you mean C-suite, then yeah, you'll probably consider an MBA when that time comes, just like a Masters in Education can make a principal out of a teacher.\n\n&gt;3) I may have significantly limited access to jobs at higher profile companies including those outside of BC and \nCanada (e.g. FAANG). \n\nUBC has a bit more international brand-recognition which *might* lead to better networking opportunities, but I wouldn't deem this advantage as 'significant' if at all. Your attractiveness to upper echelon tech firms will depend on way more than which school you came from.\n\n&gt; 4) The diploma may give me significantly weaker and less-enduring knowledge of CS fundamentals than the alternative. \n\nThis is definitely the case with coding bootcamps vs 2 year programs, but we're comparing apples to apples here; I don't believe you learn any more/less with either program, you simply learn what you can. Endurance comes from self-study and applying what you've learned, outside as much as inside the classroom.\n\n\nMy overall thoughts: the 'second degree' is mostly marketing; they're both two year programs, they both require roughly the same amount of credits, and there's nothing in either program that you can't learn from YouTube. The biggest differences, imo, are that UBC *requires* a previous Bachelors which probably raises the 'maturity' bar a bit (you will study alongside 18/19 y/o's in CST), name-brand recognition *might* lead to more networking opportunities, and their endowment makes for some nice facilities/campus life (but let's be real, you will be too busy staring at your laptop to really enjoy it).\n\nI'm halfway through CST and have zero regrets. Tech moves quickly, and you improve your career prospects by engrossing yourself and moving with it. I think at the end of the day it depends on your passion for computing: do you love it enough not to backburn it by a full year?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m halfway through CST and in the co-op program; I would definitely have picked BCS if both choices were presented to me. However, time is a valuable thing. If you\u2019re looking to get a programming job at a small to medium sized company in Vancouver as quickly as possible, CST will do great for you. You can always work full time for a while then switch jobs to a larger company. The department is also thinking of turning the two year BTech following CST into a B.Sc., so that could be quite prospective as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re under no time constraint, applying to BCS next year while biding time at CST could work well. However keep in mind, I think CST credits don\u2019t transfer unless you have earned the full diploma. This gives you the flexibility of choice in one year\u2019s time. You can choose to finish the last leg of CST or swap to BCS if admitted.\n\nI think the CS Bachelors goes a long way if you\u2019re looking to work in the US eventually. You\u2019re also limited to 8 months of co-op with ONE company at BCIT, while BCS lets you do multiple.\n\nAt the end of the day, experience is king when it comes to the software development industry. It really comes down to what internships or full time experiences you end up having on your resume. Your degree and education is far less important than having a good collection of tangible work experience. Heck some people don\u2019t even have CS or technical degrees and have managed to do well. That\u2019s just my two cents.",

Big companies like Amazon or Microsoft won't reach BCIT's students for coop interviews. My Co-op coordinator told us that they said they will think about BCIT if we have a four-year program.\n\n1. Less chance to get the interview compared to UBC and SFU. To be fair, CST students find a coop job after term one and it is not easy for them. Many CST students have a degree before CST, so it may help them but not much.\n2. 4 years and 2 years, so you can know what the difference is. Timing and practicing. SFU and UBC can have multiple times to do the coop, but BCIT has only 1 time and it is competitive.CST is such a heavy workload and I feel it is not good as Redditors said here, but students who study at CST are really hard-working and that makes the program famous. As I mentioned above, many students from CST have another degree, so it will help them a bit when they find a job.\n3. Out of BC, few people know about BCIT, but they know SFU and UBC. Because of that students from UBC or SFU can work in the US for their internship or full-time. BCIT can do it after a few years of working.",

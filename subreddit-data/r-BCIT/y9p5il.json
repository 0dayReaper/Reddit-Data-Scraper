    "postText": "I am an international student applying to a program for fall. I don\u2019t have a visa credit card however I do have a dual currency visa debit card. I emailed them they said they don\u2019t accept visa debit so I was thinking of using flywire which they gave me as an option. \nNow they said I have to email them right away after making the payment. Now as I am not enrolled there I don\u2019t have a student ID, they asked me to email them first thing is that. Is my bcit ID my student ID? \nAsking here bc they take forever to respond pls help me out :((",

    "postText": "Im not much of a complainer, but i feel like this needs to be addressed.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, the school has transitioned online and I can say that I'm not having the best experience with it. To be honest, i feel completely ripped off. \n\nI am currently a full-time student at BCIT, and im taking 6 courses online. I have noticed that most of the teachers/instructors arent doing their jobs properly. Students are asked to read textbook on their own, and thats it. Zoom links are given, but the instructor is stay muted for both the lecture and lab section. Instructors give students powerpoint slides that are prepared by the textbook company (in my case, its prepared by Pearson).\n\nWould this be the case as well if Covid never happened? Teachers showing up to class and do nothing during the whole lecture and lab period? What are they getting paid for exactly? \n\nWhat's the point if students are asked to learn on their own without any guidance, explanation, or help from instructors?",

He definitely was not monitoring us whatsoever.\n\nNot really here to say it was a waste of time (most of us seemed to eventually work on other assignments from other classes), but this teacher was notorious for not being very captivating of his intended audience or engaging in even the chat last term, and it's a pain to see it repeat this term as well.\n\nThe term is still young I guess, not all of our instructors are like this.

The best advice that I could give is if you have set representatives is to bring your concerns to them. They would have to notify the professor in question about your / their concerns. I also recommend contacting your associate dean if it's a professor issue. \n\nOur cohort spent a good chunk of all of last semester to try and improve our study conditions, and we saw some improvements this semester with some issues that we had. We were very very persistent about it though.\n\nHonestly though, some professors are hit and miss even if it's in person. I'm not sure if even doing all of the above, your study conditions will change. It is worth a shot, but it probably requires a lot of persistence on your cohort's / set representatives end to keep bringing up the issues with your professor and associate dean.",

There are sometimes you will get frustrated  as each student but the end goal is rewarding. You will surely get job in the province than students from other colleges",

Taking time off work and booking everything makes this extremely difficult. No remorse from complaints to dean. \n\nNo back up plans or anything from BCIT. Pre covid they were already bad. Post covid and they are even worse and the online portion is equally bad with teachers who are ex sailors that have no teaching experience prior. Makes it very tiring.",

The teachers don't seem to know how to properly do the classes online. Now, i wouldn't say BCIT is a bad school, like my dad has been making an effort to teach his students such as making a weekly podcast and presenting presentations he made to his class, he also went to BCIT to get a few of his degrees and said that it was much better in person. We also need to respect teachers as they are going through a lot of stress now with the pandemic, but your concerns are fully understandable given the situation, but maybe you could try to be a little bit more self sufficient in the future.",

I think this particular course content really disseminated well online, and perhaps some other courses benefit from being in person. I hope BCIT figures out which ones work online and which don't in the future because doing this course online made it easier and cheaper for me to attend.",

Teachers are incredibly helpful, online, during office hours and through emails. Supplementary material is given to expand more on what they\u2019re teaching, but even then I get more info during lectures than I do reading the recommended textbooks. I\u2019m so sorry to hear that so many people are not getting the education that they\u2019re paying for.. Bring it up with your set rep because they have interim meetings with program heads, and if majority of people are complaining, then they are more likely to do something about it.",

After the first course most of the assignments had questions not covered in the course and required hours of searching online to answer them, to top it off they only offer the certification course once you've completed the other courses when they feel like it, which might be never in the case of my coworker.  Asking for help from the \"instructor\" just led to recommendations to talk to your course tutor that told me at the beginning it had been so long since he'd done the program, and the content had changed so much he didn't think he could help.",

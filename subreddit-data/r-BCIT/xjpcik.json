    "postText": "Right now, I'm currently a Red Seal machinist and millwright as well as a industrial electrician apprentice. I'm also a 5th class power engineer and I'm considering doing my 4th and 3rd some time down the road, but that's a discussion for another time....\n\nI'm considering going for my BBA, but I'm wondering if it's actually possible to do it fully online like advertised since I live and work full-time in Langley. \n\nI don't have any academic education aside from trades school and power engineering, but have always been at the top of my classes scoring 90%+ on everything for machinist/millwright/electrical. I think because they're very technical trades, my math is probably quite a bit stronger than a lot of other people's due to using math a lot for many years.\n\nMy grades in high-school were very subpar. I did quite terribly, but that was a bit over 13 years ago.\n\nWill I be able to get in through the executive pathway for the BBA program? I have 2 Red Seals and over 5 years of management/supervisory experience so far. Will I need anything else? I don't have a diploma from another academic or anything, but from my understanding, I meet the entrance requirements due to those factors. \n\nAny input anyone could give or advise to share?\n\nOne of the reasons why I'm wanting to start something like this is that I had hurt my back not long ago and was completely unable to walk for a good couple weeks. It's all better now, buy I got worried that if it had been something more serious, I have no skills that don't have me fixing a machine or using a machine to make parts.... that could be difficult crawling under machines, taking them apart if something bad did happen... can't afford to live off disability jn this economy...",

BBA has certain requirements and even the advanced diploma has certain criteria that you do not meat academically. It is a good choice to get into and hope the best for you.",

Find the exact ones you need for the BBA diploma, finish those and apply. You'll get in. After that it's 2 years and you won't be able to do it all online nor work nearly as much as you do now. My thought was now or never and I don't regret it at all, bcit is a good school and sets us up well. Good luck",

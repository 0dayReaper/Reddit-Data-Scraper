As a result, I've been researching different institutions, and BCIT has caught my interest and have a few questions in mind. When you have the time, could you please respond to the following? It would be greatly appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy did you choose BCIT?\n\nWhat information do you know about the CST program?\n\nHow has your experience been? (I've heard it's stressful)\n\nTo those who have graduated, how quick did you get settled into a new job?\n\nIs BCIT recognized in Toronto?",

            "comment": "2021 CST grad currently working remotely for a Toronto tech company here \ud83d\udc4b  \n\n\n&gt;Why did you choose BCIT?\n\nCST was my top choice out of high school because of the curriculum that focused heavily on applicable skills and getting career-ready in a shorter time frame so I could enter the workplace quickly. I also liked the set based model and small class sizes so I could easily make connections with peers and instructors. The co-op and industry sponsored projects were invaluable to kick start our careers too.  \n\n\n&gt;What information do you know about the CST program?\n\nNot sure what kind of information you're looking for, official info on courses etc is on the website: [https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/)  \n\n\n&gt;How has your experience been? (I've heard it's stressful)\n\nYes, be prepared for an intensive experience if you take this program. You can expect lots of heavy course loads and tough curriculum, but I think it was worth it. You learn time management skills and teamwork, really have to lean on your set mates and help each other get through it.  \n\n\n&gt;To those who have graduated, how quick did you get settled into a new job?\n\nI had my job contract in hand before starting my last term, a return offer from my most recent internship. Getting co-op and doing well in the internships is the most important thing and the best way to secure jobs; most of my classmates that didn't do co-op still got jobs but it was harder for them and many were still searching by the time they graduated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Is BCIT recognized in Toronto?\n\nIn my experience, not really.. but that doesn't matter too much. I did my first internships at a Vancouver company before moving to a Toronto one, and they mostly just asked about my work experience and not about my school. Many of my coworkers from Ontario don't know BCIT and assume I went to UBC, and I often don't bother correcting them because my skills are what matter. Although when I do explain what BCIT is and how our curriculum differed from a traditional uni, I usually get responses like \"I wish I had a program like that when I was younger\" \ud83d\ude42",

            "comment": "  Not entirely sure why they sent me this question, but I'll answer honestly. I didn't choose bcit. I choose to enter a trade level position for which bcit offers no courses. Bricklayer. Previously, I sought out bcit for their electrical program only to discover that there was a two year wait list. When I sought out a bricklayer course, it seemed strange to me that it was not offered as it is in such high demand. \n  Some years later when I had acquired my first aid level three, I inquired into the CST program as a means of enhancing my ability to run my own company. I do believe that the program has many benefits and that there is need of enforcement of its principles. However, I do not have confidence that it is a stand alone program. The best safety officers that I have met are trades people who later explore that aspect of construction we refer to as safety. Making safety a primary profession is problematic. The tendency, and this is not to suggest that it may be true in every case, is that safety officers disassociate themselves from those whom they are governing. I use the term governing in a very authentic sense without any derogatory implication as they exercise a degree of legitimate power due to the authority of their position. \n  I assume that you are seeking a career path for the purpose of providing security of your future worth. As a young person, ask yourself why you would prefer to seek such a position. You will make more money as a tradesperson as it is in higher demand. Whatever you choose for yourself, as the choice is yours, be aware that it is a position of service.",

There's a mutual respect between all bcit grads because they've all gone thru hell. In my case I didn't get a job out of my program but it taught me what I can do and how to study and learn.",

    "postText": "I started the course certificate I needed and finished all the courses but one, I provided the midterm mark as stated on the website for a transfer into the diploma program but now they are saying \"  need to see the final mark before your application will be reassessed \" when the website page indicates \"Midterm Grade Submission form \\[PDF\\]\" is enough.  \n\n\nI'm also not \" currently eligible for this program \" for the program I'm currently in ??? They did to be fair allow me extra days past the current deadline, but that caused even more confusion as they stated a final mark is needed when the website says midterm marks are allowed. I'm one course away from my certificate and a couple of courses away from my diploma and I've never had problems with the admin/advisors before. Actually, they helped me get into the program and I thrived thanks to the way they selected my courses. I've been honestly in circles and kind of panicking as I'm worried my courses will get filled.",

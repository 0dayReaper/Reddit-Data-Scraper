With that being said, if you have a passion of the heart, it\u2019s an amazing program!\nIf you do year 1 PT and year 2 FT, it will take around 3 - 4 years to finish the program due to clinical requirements.",

(4 - fall) (4 - winter) (3 - spring/summer). Definitely wanted some time for myself and my other hobbies.\n\nThe courseload can be difficult depending on the amount of time you have available; for example, if you have a job and or other hobbies that take a good chunk of your day, then six courses wouldn't be the best option.\n\nI would recommend starting part-time and seeing how that first semester goes, before taking it fulltime,\n\nYour grades my take a hit depending on how many courses you take so choose wisely,\n\nKeep on eye on CARD 1101, as it is the most difficult course in the first term and does require lots of extra time and reading, as well as BHSC 1119,\n\nIf you're in a rush to finish quickly, by all means, go for a full course, but if you're okay with graduating maybe a semester or two, then go for something reduced, and your mental health will thank you.",

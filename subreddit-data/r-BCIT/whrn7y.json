You can just let your bank know that you contacted the merchant, and they could not resolve your issue. Keep any communication as backup. This is usually enough information for TD to investigate and give you your money back. I've done a few times and I don't waste much time arguing with the merchant because they will usually do what's best for themselves. But I think BCIT is honestly just not seeing any transactions on record. But I have a feeling you may need to contact someone from BCIT Finance and not BCIT Registration to make sure they don't have any records of it. But again, that's more their problem than it is yours. You just tell the bank you already tried.",

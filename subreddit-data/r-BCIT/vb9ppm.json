Because there is a set system, BCIT organizes all of your courses for you based on which set you\u2019re put in and the program course requirements.\n\nFrom my understanding, registering for classes only applies to part-time studies or Bachelor\u2019s degree &amp; above programs.\n\nShould be able to look up your timetable closer to your program\u2019s start date on either my.bcit.ca or timetables.bcitsitecentre.ca\n\nHope that helps!",

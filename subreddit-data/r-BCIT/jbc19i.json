    "postText": "Hi Guys,\n\nI have this situation in my hand that I do not know what to think of, or how to proceed. So, I was taking a correspondence class with this instructor. I was supposed to write a final (they only have one final in correspondence class worth 90%) around mid March, and that's when the whole covid thing happened. I did not hear back much about the class from the instructor, or program co-ordinater. After countless emailing back and forth in late August, I was notified that I am eligible to write the final, but I would be online proctored using Proctorio U.\n\nSo under this new  decision, I would write midterm and final instead of just one final. I emailed the prof regarding the midterm coverage, and she mentioned it would be just 3 chapters, when the entire course covers around 10 chapters. I was confused because in my mind, it didn't make sense for only 3 easy chapters  to be in the midterm so I emailed the prof again. She verified that it was just 3 chapters.\n\nFast forward to the midterm, to my shock, it wasn't just 3 chapters but 6! I did the exam to my best ability and emailed the instructor, rather distressed, explaining the situation and if I could rewrite. To my shock, I got several emails back and forth that were utterly disrespectful. The first email I got opened with \"don't put the high in high  maintenance\", she accused me of trying to get easy A, that she has two kids in uni and everyone knows that midterm covers first half of the course, that she was tired of students that were incapable of following simple instruction, and that I could check her credentials if I was doubting her, that she does not get paid enough by BCIT anyways, that she never said it was just 3 chapters. After sending her the screenshot of the email that she sent me, she said I didn't have a case anyways, I should give up, and that my marks (55%) was much better than what her previous students got and the marks I aimed (70%) I wouldn't have gotten it anyways...\n\nTo say I was shocked would be an understatement. I had never ever had any instructor that spoke to me the way she did. I know maybe the points I mentioned may not look that bad, but her entire emails made me feel intimidated, stupid, and I just knew that it wasn't right. I just decided to let go of situation, I did not have energy to fight. To be honest, I think I was just scared and wanted the class to be done with. \n\nI did the final of the class a week after. and that was during end of August. My Mid September, I still didn't have my final marks. I emailed her about 5 times to get my marks and she said she would get to it. To my disbelief, I got a email from the dean saying they suspect me of cheating and my answers looks too close to the answer key, and then I copy pasted from answer key in the exam?? I was so taken aback. It was weird because if anyone were to just check the screen monitored video from proctorio, you could see I did not copy pasted anything. Furthermore, there are instructor that give out past exam and their answer that is very similar to current exam. I tried explaining this to the dean, and he just told me to wait. Meanwhile I emailed some of my classmate and they said they got their marks within 2-3 days of final, and I'm wondering why she didn't check mine till mid September after emailing so many times?  After waiting around 10 days since the email from dean, I emailed him back saying what's the update because I had not heard anything. He said he is dropping my case to be fair because he hadn't received any evidence from the instructor. \n\nIt seems like she deliberately set me up, and I feel bullied and harassed. I don't know if I'm overthinking, or if I should file a complaint. I want some feedbacks of what you guys think I should do. \n\nThankyou!",

Escalate the situation higher if needed - you can go to your program head or the head of the department for your instructor. Tell them what you've told here, and if you have the evidence to back it up, then you absolutely do have a case. The instructor is just trying to scare you into not escalating it by saying you have no case.",

I guess she\u2019s better off fired and not on BCIT\u2019s payroll... if I was her employer I\u2019d feel embarrassed and disrespected!! Be sure to involve the dean or program head... involve as many of her superiors as possible... she\u2019ll freak out once she realizes her bosses read everything she said to you... I would just forward the email chain and summarize/highlight the statements that were offensive/inexcusable!!\n\nHope she gets fired. Keep us updated on what happens!",

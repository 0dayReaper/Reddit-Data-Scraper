I\u2019m from Alberta.\n\nWhat should I do? \n(2-year geomatics program at Burnaby)\n\n\n\nPs [Roommates]: Next month,I should be receiving my Fall 2023 admissions letter. Maybe message me if you would like a roommate or see a nice rental worth splitting. I made up a budget with rent around $800-$1200.",

Wouldn't recommend to drive, parking alone is supposed to go up to $9.25 a day from $5.85, so assuming that monthly parking will still be 15% cheaper (based on 22 days used a month), it would cost you over 2000$ alone just to park. So given how bad traffic can get here I would say save at least the money on the parking fee and add it to your rent budget to find something in closer proximity.",

I'm definitely on the lookout for a good rental house and some other students to share it with. I haven't looked at any specific places yet, but I'd be happy to take on the search with some other folks looking for the same thing.\n\nI'm from the states, but I've spent a fair amount of time in the Vancouver Metro. I'm definitely not planning on bringing a car. Seems like much more hassle (and money) than it's worth.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI've been accepted to OHS and have paid the 500 dollar prereg fee before May 3rd. Does anyone know how to get a proof of enrolment in order to access your RESP? It would be nice to not have to dip into my savings to register for my courses come the 2 weeks before July 17.",

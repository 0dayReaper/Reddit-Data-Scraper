    "postText": "Hey everyone! I (24M) moved to Canada a few months ago to pursue my masters (mods - I don\u2019t go to BCIT so please feel free to remove if it\u2019s against the rules).\n\nI\u2019m looking to develop some good friendships and meet new people. I\u2019m from a tech background (cybersecurity specifically) but do not mind meeting folks from other fields and professions.\n\nI like to go on walks, trying out new cafes and pubs, watching movies. Feel free to hit me up if anyone is interested! I live in the New West area and don\u2019t mind traveling. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm a BC Highschool student with an 89% in Pre-Calculus 12, and ongoing in English Studies 12 since I'm in my 2nd semester. I don't have any programming electives, unfortunately. I've noticed lots of people on this subreddit saying that CST domestic high school average is 89% +.  I'm not the best at English so I don't think I'm getting a 89%+ grade in English which is why I'm not applying to CST. I do believe my grades are highly promising for CIT which is the reason I'm applying for it instead. In the future I really would like to work in the Front-End or Back-End developer jobs. I saw people say CIT is less focused on programming unlike CST but there are still programming classes (I think?). Preferably for those who graduated CIT, my main question is how difficult will it be for me to find a developer job after completion **WITH SOME CO-OP** experience (say like 4-6 months), IDK how much people normally get) and **WITH NO CO-OP** experience at all?  \n\n\nSide  questions:   \n\n\nIs it highly helpful to learn programming before starting CIT? If YES, what language(s)?  \n\n\nIf you are a graduate of CIT, how long has it been since graduation, and what position do you work in? (What company if you're comfortable.)  \n\n\nHow vigorous is the program?--Am I able to work a part-time job 2-3 times a week? \n\nWhat coding languages does CIT teach you?   \n\n\nI'm very sorry if any of these questions seem stupid and obvious. I'm just a highly skeptical person. Thank you for taking your time to read and possibly answer my question(s).  \n\nHave a great day and best of luck for all applicants. :)",

            "comment": "I graduated from CIT in 2021 but went straight into the Game Development Btech program afterwards so I don\u2019t have a job in the industry yet. \n\nWhen I got into CIT I had a 92% in pre calc 12 and a 82% in English 12. I also had a few programming related electives but I don\u2019t think it matters. I applied in November nearly a year before I expected to start the program and was waitlisted until August (program started in September). \n\nThe courses in CIT are not really hyper-focused on any specific area and instead cover a wide range of subjects with low depth. You learn about  several things including hardware of computers and how to diagnose and fix them, network security, statistics, data analytics, database management, server management, and some programming including web development and scripting. \n\nThe languages covered when I took the program were Python and JavaScript mainly. JavaScript was used alongside HTML and CSS for all of the web dev courses and Python was used for the intro to programming and object oriented programming courses. You\u2019ll learn the basics of programming but won\u2019t become a good programmer by any means. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in a career in web development or it services CIT is good. It also provides a foundation to build on if you want a different developer position. \n\nOne thing to note also is that although I went from CIT into a CST Btech degree, I don\u2019t think that path is possible anymore. Since last year, CIT doesn\u2019t provide the necessary prerequisites.\n\nGood luck with BCIT, if you have any other questions feel free to ask.",

            "comment": "Hey, I am not sure about the grade cut-off for both CST and CIT because I am doing CST via Flex. Although if I am not mistaken, from what info I acquired, the cut-off is also dependent on the average grades of the total applicant.  \n\n\nThe majority of the CST students are not taking any part-time because of the sheer load. Though it is not impossible to do part-time work. For CST co-op, it is highly competitive since the seats are limited, which means, you need to put in an effort.  \nAs for CIT, I only have accounts from my cousin who graduate from BCIT in CIT. He was able to have a part-time as an uber eats delivery over the weekend. As for programming languages, based on him, CIT had Python, SQL, HTML and CSS, and JS. He had a co-op in CIT and heard that it is not as competitive in comparison to CST. As for work, my cousin now works as a QA in a tech company.   \n\n\nIf you want to be a developer, CST might be the one you need to take. Another option you can do for CST is you take CSC and do good with it, then transfer to CST full-time to finish the rest of the diploma. The downside is that you will not be eligible to do co-op if you choose to do csc first.  \n\n\nOne final note is to try to apply and see, you never know. You are still young and don't rush too much. **Try to contact BCIT program advising also**.",

                    "comment": "Hello, \n\nFirst off, thank you such a extensive response. CSC is only a part-time program and I want to fully commit to school so full-time is in my interest. Say if I were to do CSC and move on to complete the CST program. I feel like going into CIT to get diploma with **CO-OP experience** rather than the long part-time journey to complete CST with **NO CO-OP experience** is better. Since you know, experience looks good. Just my take on it.",

Although with CIT , you will take extra courses to be able to get into bachelor's.  \n\n\nDo mind, that co-op gives you a little bit of push in the job market but not by a long shot. It will still be up to you and what career path you want to take.",

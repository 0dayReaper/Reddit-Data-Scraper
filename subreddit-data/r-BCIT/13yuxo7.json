            "comment": "My knowledge is a little out of date, but when I did third semester Algo was the \"filter\" class. Other classes are hard, in the sense you have to memorize a lot of information and regurgitate it on a test. Algorithms you either understand, or you don't. The tests had puzzles that did not appear in the textbook and you had to just 'get it' to find the answer.",

            "comment": "IMO, from worst to best.\n\n1. Stats - I hated this course because of the instructor; but I was PTS so probably not applicable to you. \n2. Data Comms - This course was hard, but I was lucky enough to have it with Chi En who is awesome. Still difficult, but really enjoyed it.\n3. Algorithms - Kinda challenging, but not a bad one. Had an awesome Prof.\n4. OOP 2\n5. Android\n\nBoth Stats and Data Comm are probably unlike anything you've ever done before. IE: Things like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution.",

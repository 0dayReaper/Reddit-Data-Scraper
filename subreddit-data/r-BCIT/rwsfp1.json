I probably need as much therapy as he does.\n\nI read all his posts since starting CST in September 2020. Ironically in all that time I've done half the course and got an internship. \n\nIt's normal to worry a bit (I do it too sometimes) but you're way better off putting that time and emotional energy into something that will help your career or life in general.",

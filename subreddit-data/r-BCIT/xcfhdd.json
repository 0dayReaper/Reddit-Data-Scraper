    "postText": " \n\nHello BCIT Peeps, \n\nBCIT computing club is more than excited to start this Fall semester with a club orientation taking place this **Wednesday at 5:30 pm!** BCIT computing was created to support students with a common interest in tech and includes biweekly events with industry professionals from FANG companies and QA sessions regarding tech interviews/CST's Co-Op program! We also host a hackathon during the Winter term which had upwards of 100 participants with 2500 dollars in cash  prizes. Linked below is BCIT's computing club discord where future events will be announced as well as a hub for you to connect with like minded students. \n\n[https://discord.gg/x9rQF2qa](https://discord.gg/x9rQF2qa)",

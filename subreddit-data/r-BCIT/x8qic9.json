And today I had a really bad panic attack after my first class thinking about everything. Do you guys have any tips on handling the workload or general anxiety tips? I'm up for quitting my job even though I only work once a week but I'm kind of stressed and scared I also don't have any friends here. Thanks.",

Generally I'd use an excel spreadsheet, that just made it easier for me.\n\nThen I'd colour code everything. Lectures, labs, quizzes, tests, assignments, midterms presentations, etc. Being able to visually SEE the whole semester laid out like that really helped me.\n\nThen I'd look for problem areas. Four midterms on one day? Gonna need to start studying WAY in advance. Two presentations the same day? Don't plan on practicing the night before, won't be time.\n\nOther than that, start EVERY assignment the moment you receive it. Like as soon as an assignment touches your hands, head home and try to finish it that night.",

            "comment": "I had two academic semesters like this - one with 10 classes and one with 9. It was incredibly hard but I learned some things from the first semester that made the next slightly more manageable: \n\n\n- as others have mentioned, put all due dates/assignments/exams etc in a planner ASAP. This will help to relieve anxiety and make sure you don't loose any marks simply by forgetting about a due date.\n\n\n- realistically for myself, after the first semester like this I realized there is no way you can give 100% in all these classes. You need to figure out where your strengths/weaknesses are in the program and use your time accordingly. Is there a class that is maybe less important than some others and you know you can probably just study the weekend before an exam and do *okay* enough to pass? Are there any courses known to be particularly difficult or the one that students are most likely to fail? Make sure to stay on top of those courses, put extra time in if you don't understand a concept.\n\n\n- lastly, try not to stress too much about your grades as long as you are above the passing grade (easier said than done I know). Not sure about your program, but when we graduated our prospective employers were not asking about our grades - they make sure you know your stuff, can you work well in the field, and did you graduate lol. Try not to stress if some of your peers are getting 90% in a class you are getting 75% - you may have strengths in other areas that they do not!",

The max I had was doing 5 courses via PTS while working full-time which I think is equally insane as taking 9 courses.\n\nMy advice when having a heavy course load are the following:\n- Clarify all doubts in the lesson during the class(keep asking your professor)\n- for the next 3-4 months, dedicate your energy not to study, but to manage your schedule. (You will have little time to study outside class)\n- study hard during class and do your assignment right away the moment you have a time. (Always study your hardest during class and use tour time outside class for assignments and requirements)\n- balance your sleep schedule (make sure to get the minimum hours of sleep that will make you feel rested)\n- if you are not able to sleep well, practice power nap. (This is a game changer)\n- Maintain a good balance meal (DON'T OVER EAT OR STRESS EAT)",

So you can know when you have quizzes, test, midterm, \u2026\n- Always try to do your assessment asap, do not procrastinate \n- Always have besties who are in same set in order to studying together and help each other. \n- During break time, you can read textbook, do assignments or prepare for your next class. You can try to take quick nap as well.\n\nYou will be fine ^^",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am planning to apply for the Medical Lab Science course at BCIT, and I was wondering how difficult I can expect the MMI to be? Do they ask very technical questions, or just behavioral questions? I understand from previous threads that during COVID the interview process involved 3 simple quizzes, but I am wondering what the current trend is like? It would be great if anyone who has recently appeared for their MMI can share their experience. :)",

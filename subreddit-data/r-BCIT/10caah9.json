    "postText": "Somebody who took this program a few years ago told me that Managerial Economics was by far the hardest course of all. Do you agree? I'm trying to decide if I should take this course by itself or together with a marketing course.\n\nFor those of you who have taken it recently, did your instructor (Iryna or Charlene) let you use crib note during exams? This sounds like a stupid question, but we were allowed one piece of note in Calculus class, so that's why I'm asking.\n\nAlso, the Econ exams I took during diploma program were all multiple choice base - was hoping this would be the case here....any comment on that would be also appreciated!! \n\nThanks!",

I remember I got like 60% on the midterm... most people failed and there's like 1 person who got above 70%. \n\nThe final exam I think was harder though. But do every single piece of homework. Also, graphing calculators are not allowed... however in the first calculus course, it never indicated that graphing calculators aren't allowed. So I basically just programmed my calculator to do some of my work, but you can't do that in this class. \n\nGood luck!",

Most of the marks will be recreating graphs and solving equations which sometimes depend on your calculations of the graph. Showing all your work is required to receive marks. So if you only show the answer you'll get 1 mark of like 12... any critical steps skipped or not shown will be a zero mark of the 12. So if you skip all steps, you'll get 1/12 on that question. That's what I remember.",

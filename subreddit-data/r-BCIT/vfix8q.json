I would love to meet many of you! If anyone wants a new friend and has gone through/is going into the program, then dm me :)",

            "comment": "Congrats on getting into the program !!! I'm sure you've worked very hard during the selection process so good job on that. There may be changes to your program as you'll be the first cohort to have a fall start but from personal experience there aren't many textbooks that are needed throughout the program. The only book that is mandatory in level 1 is the Laboratory Safety CSMLS Guidelines which was only helpful for like a few chapters in one of your courses. \n\nOutside of that, the only book you really need is Rodak's Hematology for Heme 1/2 in your upper levels as those course are very much self orientated and you will be referring to that textbook for many of your lab assignments. Two other books which are optional but helpful for your upper level studies are Anderson's Atlas of Hematology and Urinalysis and Body Fluids but I wouldn't worry about any of these yet.\n\nThe instructors are great in giving you enough practices through quizzes and assignments so you should be fine in that department and most will provide lecture notes which are clear and understandable or at least to the extend you would know what to search on YouTube if further clarification is needed.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is just to study hard and make friends along the way. This program will definitely be harder if you try to solo grind the courses. Being organized early on will also be very helpful as there are many assignments and quizzes to keep track of. Lastly, just a friendly reminder that mistakes do happen in lab and as consequential as they may seem, they're also great learning opportunities and it's best to recognize them and move on.\n\nWelcome to the MLS program and congratulations again!",

I am most likely not going to work just to focus on the program because I heard that the load is  H E A V Y. I was planning to dedicate my time in school during tutorial hours so that I can get as much work done and get clarification or anything else I need there. \n\nWhat do the hours + schedule look like? I have no idea how often we will have to be on-campus throughout the week and how long. \n\nCan I get by with just bringing my iPad to classes? Or would I absolutely need to bring my laptop, notebooks, etc.? \n\nLast thing\u2026 anything I can do to prepare myself before going into the program?",

                            "comment": "Just a fair warning again that your workload and schedule may be slightly modified due to your cohort being the first to experience the newly introduced format of the program but the expected workload is typically not that bad for level 1. I personally continued to work once per week during the term and knew of a few others which were doing 2 days so it is very much doable. However, I would agree with the program's advice and say that it'd be beneficial for your studies to take a sabbatical from your employment if you're financially able to. On average you should expect to spend around 3-5 hours of studying/assignment work each day and more during busier weeks. Keep in mind that you only need 60% to pass any given component but you can easily exceed that amount of hours depending on how much effort you're willing to put in. \n\nBefore diving into scheduling I should explain that our program divides the cohort into 'sets' to accommodate lab scheduling so on some days you may have longer breaks after your lectures and some days you may end the school day earlier than others depending on the set you've been assigned to. Our program also has the pleasant characteristic that it enjoys shifting your classes and labs around on a weekly basis so it's hard to have a definitive time table. On a typical day however, the day begins with a 8:30am lecture and ends by 4:30pm the latest with an hour lunch break in between. On Wednesdays your classes will end by 2:30pm instead and you can expect to be on campus from Monday-Friday for classes and labs with the weekends off.\n\nYou can absolutely get by with just bringing your iPad to classes, it really depends on your note taking style and what you may find more convenient. Most classes will upload lecture slides the night before while others may opt to provide lecture notes for the entire chapter instead. \n\nDepending on how long you've been out of school it may be helpful to revisit some of the basic biology and chemistry concepts but the level 1 courses are designed so that they will provide all the foundational knowledge you'll need to succeed so I wouldn't worry about it. Just enjoy your summer and rest well before the school term.",

            "comment": "Some people had jobs during Level 1 so it can definitely be done if you manage your time well. I will say most people opted for no jobs and were less stressed than the ones that did have a job.\n\nI honestly only used my iPad in Level 1 and the textbooks can all be found online but you can definitely get by without using them. \n\nExpect to be in school M-F 8-4 (some days in level 1 you will get off early or have a half day but that goes away in the later levels). You\u2019ll also be spending 4-6 hours studying and working on assignments after class too. If you manage your time well, you can definitely have a school-life balance in level 1! Again, workload gets A LOT heavier with later levels so be prepared. If you feel like you can\u2019t manage level 1, you might have a hard time later because that one is significantly less stressful (although still veryyy stressful). I would recommend staying on top of everything by doing things well ahead of time and also going over lecture material the week of so it makes studying for exams a lot easier (this is what I did in level 1 and I think my stress level was relatively good)",

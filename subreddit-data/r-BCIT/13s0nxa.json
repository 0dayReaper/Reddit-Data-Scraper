    "postText": "Hi, I'm a current university student looking to apply to the 2024 intake of the GIS advanced diploma. I failed an intro to CS course last term (elective). My average for last year is about 85% excluding the failed course. How much of an impact will it have in terms of getting admitted?",

            "comment": "Aside from the grade of your English 12 or equivalent/greater course, your GPA doesn't matter for GIS advanced diploma admissions. However, you need a BCIT diploma or equivalent, or a university degree, **or 60 credits from a recognized post-secondary school** with 18 of them being at the second-year or higher level and 3 credits in an English/BCIT comm equivalent course. If failing your course causes you to have less than 60 credits, then you won't meet the requirements.\n\nIf you're applying for the full-time version, you should know that the program accepts students on a first come first served basis meaning BCIT accepts you if you meet the minimum requirements and there is space. Competitive entry programs look at all applicants after the deadline and accept students based on the highest grades.\n\n[https://www.bcit.ca/programs/geographic-information-systems-advanced-diploma-full-time-9100fadvdip/#entry](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/geographic-information-systems-advanced-diploma-full-time-9100fadvdip/#entry)",

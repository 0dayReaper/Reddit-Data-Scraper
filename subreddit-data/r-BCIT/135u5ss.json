The stylus on my think pad and the Surface Pro 9 are sooo behind Apple in terms of usage, flexibility and also battery life.\n\nIf you have the chance, hop into the Apple Store and give it a try before you make a commitment and you will see what I am talking about.",

When i got my pro both the air and pro were M1 and with the amount of storage i got it just made more sense to get the pro. However now that the pros are m2 there is more of a difference between them so it may be better to stick with the air. Im sure there are lots of youtube videos comparing them.",

Personally i have the 11\" M1 Ipad Pro and really like it. \n\nI will say that in the summer (i think it's July - September) they often have good student deals. The student prices will be the same but you'll get a bonus apple gift card or airpods (varies each year). Last year when i got my ipad i got a $150 apple giftcard which i used to buy the pencil so i only had to pay like $30 instead of the almost $200. Every little bit helps.",

I'm currently doing some online courses (estimating, communications, Building Code) and being online, I'm interested in taking my notes on a tablet. Writing with a stylus would be a necessity, I already have a desktop and a laptop. Logging everything digitally could be convenient for always having all my notes, as well as better organization.\n\nI'm weighing the iPad Pro and Surface Pro 9 against each other, I'm mainly a Windows user, but have an older iPad (without pencil support). I'm leaning slightly towards the iPad, because my main use will be note taking. I have other devices to run dedicated software.",

Having said that I am not using it as much as the old one and often prefer pen/paper. I found the eye strain was too much, I also remember things better when I write them down on paper (weird I know) and it\u2019s easier for me to find notes when written down on paper than stored on pc. I tried one note, notability and the new one for Apple products and nothing seems to stick. Having said that I also work in areas where electronics are not allowed so paper is the only option.",

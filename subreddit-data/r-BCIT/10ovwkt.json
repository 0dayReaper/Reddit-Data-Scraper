The test you just keep answering questions until you get 2 many wrong or finish them all. Yiu need a grade 10 equivalent. I'm sure BCIT uses a similar test. \n\nI was a high school drop out and scored high enough to take any course the university offered except some of the advanced electrical stuff. They will be testing you on your reading comprehension and math skills. I think you will do ok. If your very concerned try to do the accuplacer as early as possible so you have time to rewrite it before your course starts\n\nI have my millwright and welding red seals. Good luck and don't get stressed out. Trades school is kinda designed to be easy to pass. You won't learn much there, it's supplementary to what you will learn at work.",

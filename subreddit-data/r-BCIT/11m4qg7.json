    "postText": "Hello all, I completed my NAT certificate a few years ago and am considering going into the CISA program. However this CISA program is full time only and I'd be forced to either find after hours work and quit my current role as a Systems Admin. I already have 9 years of mid level IT experience so I'm wondering if any graduates of the CISA program found a significant jump in their salary vs not having the diploma? I currently make 75K/yr and trying to weigh worse case missing out 1 year of income to complete this vs the potential gain to my resume/profile over my at least 30+ years remaining until retirement?",

            "comment": "With your experience you won't benefit from the CISA program. No one really cares about what you studied once you have a few years of work experience. I would say even spending time self-learning and taking certificates would be a better investment than taking CISA in your position. Also, generally speaking switching between companies is the best way to get a salary increase.\n\nNote if you decide to take CISA, you be missing out on more than 1 year of income as NAT (with CITX 1142 + a database course) only gives you direct entry into level 2, meaning you would be studying for 3 semesters.",

            "comment": "For your situation, instead of a CISA diploma, I would concentrate on a handful of certifications as you can take them part time so you wouldn't be missing out of your current job.\n\nAs for which certifications, it depends on what \"holes\" you think exists in your experience that you would like to plug.\n\nBTW. I'm speaking from a point of knowledge on this as I've been advising the CISA program for well over a decade and hired dozens of graduates.",

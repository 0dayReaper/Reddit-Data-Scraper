Though it\u2019s unlikely to happen, some classes may get moved online for an entire day (this was earlier this year, finally back in person).\n\nAlso it\u2019s likely they\u2019re going to be opening more parking spaces as they will likely close their covid testing site later in the year\n\nAlso, it\u2019s the same price if u were to pay daily everyday for a month. There isn\u2019t a price difference last I checked.\n\nSource: Graduated in May 2022.\n\n(Reposting this comment)",

I arrived for 8:30 or 9:30 classes and never felt stressed about finding a spot. It\u2019s a 5ish minute walk to the library/gym from those lots.\n\nYou can pay by mobile using the PayByPhone app, just type in the lot number (eg 0924 for lot M, or 0926 for motorcycle parking) and you don\u2019t need to wait at the paystation. They charge you a few cents for the convenience, but when it\u2019s pouring rain and the lineup is 5 people deep and class started 3 minutes ago, I felt it had value.)\n\nMotorcycle parking is cheaper if you ride, but helmet storage can be a challenge.",

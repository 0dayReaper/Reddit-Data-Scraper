It's more on time consuming side, cuz u got assignments and readings to do, but the material isn't rocket science. \n\n7:30 start time is perfect for me, early in the morning, non rush hour, bus is not too busy, when u start working, u gotta wake up at this time too. \n\nI'm in the non co-op, which means I don't have to habe mandatory work hours as graduation requirement, but I recommend applying for the coop program, cuz they help u find work.",

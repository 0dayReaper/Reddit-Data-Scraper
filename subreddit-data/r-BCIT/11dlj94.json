I live in Burnaby and I'm a bit worried if the airport here is  employing any AME graduates at all or  will I have to move later to find work?\n\nThanks.",

There have to be other providers at the airport for things like US airlines but I don't know who they are anymore.\n\nBetter resource: http://avcanada.ca/forums2/viewforum.php?f=27&amp;sid=fa81e547fffbd325e5a2c926d23743b0",

The market also pay low for apprenticeship. About $18 to $25 max after a few years.\n\n\nGood things about the AME Diploma is that you basically have a pass to any interview that related to turn wrench. I got in apprenticeship job at a marine dealership and currently in a maintenance team for city buses. Really better pay/pension and easier on the body.",

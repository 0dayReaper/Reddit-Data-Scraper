You have all the tools now to build any app with your diploma assuming you have a CST . \n\nThough if your passion is gaming then go for Game Dev. If you want to be in the Database side then go to Database.\n\nif you checked the courses also, for part time, there are electives that you can mix and match.   \n\n\nI am curious about what you are looking for to achieve.  \n\n\nAlso be reminded that the Degree will be BScACS, and there might be some changes to the options. I heard that they will be combining Network Security Applications Development and  Network Security Administration.  \n\n\nAlmost no one is taking Wireless and Mobile Application Development from what I heard.",

Languages are just tools and as long as you have a grasp of the concept, in the C++ case it is OOP,  you can learn other languages.\n\nI assume you are already a C++ dev outside Canada. If you are then the usual route is CST diploma before you can take bachelor's.  The CST diploma is good enough to be an app developer. Bachelor's at BCIT only has options to make it interesting but the courses are not too far off.\n\nAlso there will be some changes because of the recent transition to BScACS.",

Network development was significantly harder than Database but now I spend a large portion of my time working with databases.   Its easier to pick up the database courses later.   \n\nYou can look into taking the courses on your own later or pick up some other designation to demonstrate your skill.   One of our best hires did a great job with a demo website they had put together demonstrating they could put a small application together. \n\nThere should always be work for people who are better than average.   I have worked with a lot of people who have let their skills degrade over time or who probably should not have gone into IT in the first place.",

Network Security App Development in my opinion will just give you a wider option because every tech industry is concerned with Network Security.",

Also if you plan to apply for the accounting degree you need a minimum of 70% GPA from the diploma. Also a lot of people switch to part time after first year (or drop out of program) so I would guess the average GPA isn\u2019t too high. However a lot of people are also able to get 90% or higher so it all depends! :)",

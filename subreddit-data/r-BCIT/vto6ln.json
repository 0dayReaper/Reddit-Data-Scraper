    "postText": "I've heard a lot of things about how intensive BCIT's CST program is.  I know the course work load is a lot, but how difficult is the actual subject matter and exams?  I went to school for UBC mechanical engineering a few years ago and it was no cake walk.  The exams were definitely difficult, and course load was heavy, but I got through it (with a sub-par GPA mind you).  I wonder if BCIT CST would be easier or harder compared to UBC mech eng/Comp sci?",

            "comment": "I went to UBC for eng too for two years before i switched. BCIT is MUCH better. do not let anyone here discourage u from taking the program because its a good one and here's why:\n\n1. the teacher mentality is VERY different. you've been to ubc, uk the profs there dont give two shits about the students, and it's mostly based on a screening process. At BCIT, the teachers ACTUALLY want u to graduate the program and they care alot about ur learning process. They're flexible with assignment deadlines, their exams are based off their notes and what they teach you, it's not like the ubc ones where they throw 3-4 questions compeletly out of the blue. \n2. For quizes and exams: as i said they evaluate u based on what they teach, whereas at UBC they give questions that exceed ur knowledge in some cases. \n3. Speed: speed wise id say slower than ubc eng.\n4. Now the BIG THING: i procrastinated a ton in ubc. i didn't have much motivation myself, but even when i did and tried it was hard because i didn't have the proper community and enviornment surrounding me. At UBC no one rlly gives a shit about u and everyone is just for themselves, but it's different at BCIT. Classes are way smaller, you basically get put into sets where u have 25 ppl in ur set. and you stay with these ppl for every class rotation and for the first year. So you can actually build a community for urself where everyone is helping eachother. that did it for me. I went from failing at UBC to 4.0 GPA here with 90 avg\n5. KEY NOTE: I didnt even bother doing hw at UBC most of the times. but i changed my method here because I was tired of my life. It benefits u alot if u do the homeworks as assigned on the day. They're not hard, they're not lengthy, so do it and get it out of the day. That's what me and my friends group did, and we had a social life besides school while getting good grades. And by social life i mean we could go out every friday for drinks and clubbing. U also get to eat with them during the day in between classes so that's pre chill too. \n6. Pre much everyone in our year did pre well in CST. No one was some genius, u do get 2-3 enthusiast programmers who code and program all day, thats just a given in any program. The only ppl who fked up where the ones who procrastinated and played league and valorant everyday",

                    "comment": "This was very similar to my experience as well!    \n\nI wanted to add that there is maybe 2-4 total courses that a majority of students would consider difficult (C in term 2 and OS in term 4 come to mind, and others can depend on your instructor). On the flip side, there's no \"fluff\" courses like you'd take getting a degree at UBC or other university.    \n\nThe intensity and \"difficulty\" of the program has more to do with the course load, and the fact you're taking 5-7 moderately difficult classes per semester, and each typically has a lab and quiz each week, plus multiple large assignments over the term. With good time management it's doable, and you can't really slack or procrastinate. As tough as it was, I really enjoyed those 2 years :) if I didn't, I probably would have dropped out lol",

It depends purely on the average overall percentage of the set. The top students from the set in terms of grade get invited - that\u2019s it. Nothing fancy. \n\nThe average percentage for my friends who are also in the coop term right now is ~87% overall. Could be totally different any other year since it\u2019s depending on how well the set overall is doing. Hope that makes sense :)",

As long as you have decent time management, it shouldn\u2019t be very difficult. \n\n\nHowever, going from a decent grade to getting a co-op guaranteeing grade can be challenging. Our cohort needed an 90% avg to get in, so you really must be aiming for 100% on every assignment and giving it your all.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more challenging is after you get into co-op. You need to commit a TON of time doing projects, grinding leetcode, and doing mock interviews to prepare for your job search. It can be very overwhelming in term 2 to balance a more challenging academic work load + co-op preparations. If you\u2019re in January intake, you get the slightly easier path since you get the whole summer to prepare :\u2019).\n\n\nAlso make sure your co-op placement is something you want to be working in for 8 months. Those folks at the co-op office won\u2019t let you look for additional terms at different companies\u2026",

Will I have time partying?\n3. How much are textbooks and supplies?\n4. Tips to get homework done?\n5. Will I have a social life?\n\nAll Answers will be appreciated.",

            "comment": "Just to build on what u/Ok_General_6940 already said.\n\n1) The workload is not actually that heavy, but it is long days and having concrete plans for studying, homework, and group projects is key. I like to read textbooks between classes when I have gaps and I also use my longer gaps to go to the gym. (We staying mentally healthy out here)\n\n2)Absolutely you will, it is about being reasonable though. This is real life, not project X, and you will likely need to lower your expectations of partying and do things in a more \"grown-up\" way if you want to make it through the first year. \n\nHang out at the pub after your last class with your close classmates, or groupmates (DON'T BE THE GROUP MATE THAT DOESN'T SHOW UP) and shoot pool and drink. I am not saying you can't go to ragers, but save it for winter break, spring break, and over the summer.\n\n3) Supplies are just your laptop, a calculator for business math (60-90$ depending on any sales, check BestBuy and stuff before the on-campus store). \n\nAt least a handful of classes you will have a free textbook, but if you have to buy textbooks only buy the ones that your instructors say are mandatory (they will handout assignments through the textbook website portal)\n\nOtherwise, \"Never\" \\*cough\\* message me about where to get books you will want for reading, but don't need the assignment portals.\n\n4) Some classes (Like Business Systems) give you the opportunity to do HW in the lab, so just do that when you can. Otherwise, find anyone in your class that wants to sit down between classes with to do homework you are not feeling confident about doing at home by yourself. \n\nAnd like u/Ok_General_6940 get your deadlines in your calendar and worship your calendar because time management is the number one most important thing to succeeding at BCIT.\n\nLastly about homework, if you are needing to get something done, but just truly have no time left on that day. Do not be afraid to skip a lecture to get some homework done. For me, lots of lectures didn't help me in my first semester so I just attend the ones that I needed (math in my case) and then take that extra time to do homework and study whatever you are missing in the lecture.\n\n5) You will absolutely have a social life, it might be nerve-racking at first, but the absolute best thing about BCIT, IMO, is that right off the hop you get into a set of about 25 students and these are your classmates for the next two years (some variance, but mostly true) and you guys will quickly go from strangers to acquaintances at worst after the first full week of classes with all the icebreakers teachers will be doing. (Not one of my teachers used the same icebreaker, so I knew a lot about my 24 classmates by the first Friday)\n\nSome tips bullet point to save you time:\n\n* These people will make or break your future, do not be a rear end. \\*cough\\*\n* Look into clubs and events on campus, hundreds of students will be applying to the same jobs after you graduate, so set yourself apart.\n* Take advantage of all the resources on campus - Go through this link and really see what is available at BCIT because some things may surprise you [https://www.bcit.ca/student-services/](https://www.bcit.ca/student-services/)",

            "comment": "It's 7--8 classes a term for full-time, pretty much you can expect to be on campus some variation of 8:30-4:30 every day except Wednesday when classes stop at 2:30.\n\nWhether or not you have time for partying or a social life is really on you, but it's certainly not your typical university experience where you're out multiple times a week. There's a lot of group work and being a good team member is crucial.\n\nI can't remember how much textbooks ran me in first year (I've graduated) but there are a lot of used options. \n\nFor homework tips - make a list of your dates. Your set (group of students you're with all first year) can work together on a joint deadline list or calendar. Ensure that you don't miss deadlines - even little quizzes add up over time to a good chunk of your grade.\n\nI'd say also maximize your time in labs and in class. Use working classes to work on things and you'll have less to do at home.\n\nIt was an intense program but really worth it for me and the profs I had were great and mostly working experts in their field too. I have been working at an ad agency since graduating.",

            "comment": "1. The intensity of the workload honestly depends on you. Kids out of high school in my set found it hard, but the older adults got through it  just fine. The work is not very academic, so you will not write any essays or do any theorizing. If you plan your time management well then you will be good. Deadlines are usually weeks away from the day something is assigned. If you have taken past business classes, then the intensity will be lessened. \n\n2. Lol no. No one parties at BCIT, that\u2019s BCIT\u2019s reputation. The closest partying you\u2019ll do is drinking red bulls and doing group projects in the library at night. You\u2019ll be taking 7 courses in the first semester and 8 in your second. I had one kid in a group project that partied and slacked on his work. No one in the class enjoyed him. If you want to prioritize partying honestly go to ubc or sfu.\n\n3. Depends on the instructor. Some instructors just use a free e-textbook. Half of my classes had it free and the other half I had to spend like $90 per e-text. No one used physical textbooks, but they are an option if you prefer that.\n\n4. Oftentimes you will just need to prioritize handing an assignment in rather than understanding it fully. Deadlines can creep up fast and work can pile-up if you\u2019re busy or had procrastinated, so in moments like that, fill in parts of the assignment that you understand and guess the answers for the rest. Instructors won\u2019t allow you to hand in anything past deadline. It\u2019s best to get every assignment in even if some are half-assed, because the little marks really add up when you get your final grade.\n\n5. Yes, I had a very social life with my set mates. You\u2019re doing group projects all the time so you\u2019re never short of socialization. But I didn\u2019t see my out-of-school friends during the semester. That\u2019s ok, because when you\u2019re in school, getting your work done will be the main priority rather than socializing.",

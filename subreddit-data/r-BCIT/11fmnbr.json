    "postText": "I'm a post-secondary student and I want to transfer to BCIT. I want to apply for two programs Bachelor in Nursing and also Medical Laboratory Science (since I don't have the Human Anatomy Course required for Nursing and I'm taking it from May 1-Aug 16). I'm going to apply for nursing for the April intake in 2024, but I have a question if I get into the Medical Laboratory Science program, which starts Sept and then i also get into Nursing. Can I change to Nursing since that's my first choice?",

            "comment": "Youd essentially be dropping out and changing programs and restarting at that point. Very little courses are transferrable. There will be a slight financial hit, but there's no guarantee you'd get into nursing. Your backup at that point would be to finish med lab xD",

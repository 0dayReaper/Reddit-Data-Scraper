I am wondering in terms of a laptop would I be better investing in a PC or a MacBook?  Any insights would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",

If you already have a lot of apple products and don\u2019t mind paying the money for MacBook, then I would say go for it. Their quality is pretty good and their UI is great for productivity. But if you just want a decent laptop for class, PCs offer a lot more flexibility.",

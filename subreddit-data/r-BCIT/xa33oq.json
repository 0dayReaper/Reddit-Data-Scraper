    "postText": "Hi, \n\nSo I inquired about the bike lockers at DTC and they are only for staff with a current contract. Any chance that anyone knows a way around it or other options for actual bike lockers - like storage room, not the outside metal bike loops ? \n\nI've seen too many grown men cry over their bikes even though they had more than one nice lock on it at the DTC.... I am scared to bring it downtown and have it stolen... any suggestions? This is kind of annoying honestly- I'm willing to pay for it, there should be more options for students for this.",

BCIT, as a business, does not see this as a priority for students.  But you can be sure BCIT is about appearing like a business that cares",

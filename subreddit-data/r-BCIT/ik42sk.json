It\u2019s literally so ugly. \n- They have tabs that I never use and are just there to fill up the page (Campus life, myStuff, student resources) \n- MyCalander is useless \n- Knowledge Base is useless \n- Announcements are useless \n- Campus Announcements are useless\n- Pls upgrade!\n\nOkay maybe I\u2019m being a little too picky but I just needed to rant a bit. Pls comment if I don\u2019t make any sense or if you agree. Thank you!",

A massive amount of work was done in IT this summer to prepare for online teaching and learning and that may have pushed the release back a bit.",

I'm still using software at work from the early 90's, not because the company can't afford an update but because change presents massive risk.  Not only does it cost ridiculous sums of money when things go wrong, but it also stops you from providing your core business which cuts into revenues too.\n\nYou could always go the UBC route with the Integrated Renewal Program: https://www.ubyssey.ca/news/IRP-delayed-until-2023/.\n\n* 3-5 years delayed\n* Hundreds of millions over budget\n\nI know devs working here and they're comparing it to Phoenix Pay.  \n\nMyBCIT isn't asked to do very much, and is able to do that job fine.  I think that the correct course of action is to continue to add the required features on the learning hub, in parallel, until it can do everything that my.bcit.ca is able to do.  It can then be simply shut down rather than upgraded.",

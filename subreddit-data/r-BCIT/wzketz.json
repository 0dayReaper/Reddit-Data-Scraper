            "comment": "I used a MacBook Air before the M series came out. I wasn't the only one using a MacBook.  But I basically only used it for word processing for lab reports, emails, and not much else. For real engineering work, I would go to the computer labs set up for us. Most of that software won't run on a Mac and running a virtual machine to access Windows is a horrible experience.\n\nI can't stand Windows, so I had no desire to spend money on a Windows PC. But this means you need to spend more time on campus to complete assignments and it means you won't have a personal copy of SolidWorks to learn on. There are trade offs you need to evaluate. If you want to be a designer, you'll need to be good with SolidWorks and class time isn't enough to gain proficiency.",

            "comment": " lot of applications at BCIT are available through Citrix Workspace / AppsAnywhere.  Just in the A's I see Autodesk, AutoCAD, Altium designer, and I know Solidworks and Matlab are also there.  The apps run in the browser, but function pretty much like a native app.  Matlab for one has a full Mac version, but I found it just as easy to use it through Citrix Workspace.",

            "comment": "I don't recommend macs for any engineering program. Downloading windows is just a huge pain in the ass and a lot of softwares are *not optimized for mac. If you don't care about weight and have a larger budget a gaming laptop might work well for you. I've heard good things about Dell XPSs, asus zen and vivobooks, hp envys, and lenovo yogas. If budget permits try to get 16gb ram, but not completely necessary. You can always use school computers to run all the necessary programs, or use a virtual desktop.",

                    "comment": "&gt;lenovo yoga\n\nCan't personally recommend a Lenovo yoga. Specs are good, size is small, I like that in a laptop. I ordered one sight unseen. 1)  It got really hot doing a few simple software installs. 2) The keyboard did not have a solid feel, you press down on one key, or on the space between keys, and the surrounding keys also depressed a bit. This was the deal breaker for me. 3) The thing had this integrated cloth cover, kind of like a pair of jeans, that could not be taken off. I did not notice this in the promotional material. There were warnings included with the yoga that the cloth cover was easily worn or stained, and not to take it in to the kitchen for example.  I sent it back, and am still using 10 year old laptop.",

Not sure if that was the pen tip or the screen itself. I use a surface pro which is absolute cheeks for any softwares but I like writing my notes digitally.",

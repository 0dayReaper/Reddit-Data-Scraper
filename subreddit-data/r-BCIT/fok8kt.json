Nothing is normal now, things can't be expected to continue as normal. So many people are struggling and none of us signed up for online classes.\n\nAt the very least they should relax the withdrawal date, and extend the semester. It's not like this is all gonna be wrapped up in a few weeks and I'm pretty sure everyone's plans for the next couple months have been cancelled anyways. \n\nI also think they should just admit that they're still unprepared with logistics of online classes and shut down for a few more days so that they can figure things out, without dragging their students along for the ride.",

I commend bcit with all of thier new efforts to keep the semester alive but I just wish they can allow people to withdraw and retake the courses next semester or whenever the school reopens again without it affecting thier transcript. If I have to repay for the semester I will. and I have asked for this but I am  not getting any replies. I am so confused on what to do. I am ill right now and self isolating. But getting any help from any doctor right now feels like thier time can be used on someone else. I have never been this sick before and for this long  but every time I speak to someone thier answer is self isolate. I had a fever but I had to come in because I had a lab exam. This is a new disease and nobody really knows what it is and how it reacts to certain people. I cant even focus on my school work and when I ask a question I get no answers. I understand the person I'm askin has no answers for me. But atleast tell me you have no answers yet. Asking a question to bcit feels like when I am applying for a job and went through an interview and the interviewer is like we will let you know...  but they never do.",

Do you want to be the person who needs to be put into a box and spoon-fed instruction? \n\nSure, BCIT could have prepared better, and taken more time to do so. It\u2019s too late to change it now, so you have to live with it. Rallying the students won\u2019t change a thing. Take the opportunity now to learn and strengthen yourself, so that in the next crisis you won\u2019t be impaired by others, and you can be the one helping others. You can whine about what you can\u2019t control, or you can deal with it.",

We normally provide accommodations to students who are going through difficult times whether it's for reasons due to physical or mental health, family issues or personal struggles. I would strongly argue that at this moment, every student is in an incredibly disadvantaged position to learn, and appropriate accommodations should be made to address this. \n\nAlthough I am not officially diagnosed with ADHD or anything, I struggle a lot with focusing at home. It doesn't help that I live on campus where my living space restricted to a 3m by 5m room so it's literally like I am locked up in a prison cell. It's simply not reasonable to expect students to perform at the same level of standard and pump out the same amount of work under the current condition. We can't just turn on a switch that allows us to efficiently absorb online course content for 7+ classes a semester, still manage to do 5+ hours of lab work everyday and hand in assignments daily. \n\nMy argument is supported by the fact that most universities in Canada are rolling out much lax grading schemes and making multiple accommodations such as extending adjustments, making finals optional, allowing classes to be audited, etc. BCIT is just extremely old-fashioned and thinks inside the box to even think about making such accommodations. \n\nAnother example: Did you know that most universities also stopped requiring students to get doctor's notes if it's the first time in the year they were sick for an exam? Meanwhile, BCIT will never accept a doctor's note unless it's that special BCIT approve medical certificate and instructors will fail you just because you forgot to bring the special note to your doctor when you were sick as a dog.",

That\u2019s your weakness and your responsibility, not BCIT\u2019s. I live on campus as well. The walls are sound-insulated and it\u2019s now quiet hours 24/7.

If you want to be pampered, hand held, and spoonfed then you should have gone somewhere else. A diploma or degree from BCIT says more than you can get good grades. It says that you can work under pressure, you can adapt to new conditions, and you can face adversity. Don\u2019t you dare try and take that away from those of us that fit the criteria. \n\nBe grateful that we have the option to do school in this time.

I mean, I'll probably survive, sure. But what about students who actually have learning disabilities? Do you think people with ADHD are suddenly now able to work 70+ hours a week sitting in front of their computers at home? How about students who do not even have a proper desk/computer setup at home? Do you really think instructors are going to make special accommodations for those people in their classes unless BCIT adopts official campus-wide adjustments? Is your answer to those students also \"you just gotta find a way to do it.\"\n\nOh yea the value of your diploma is gonna get absolutely shattered and no employer will ever consider hiring BCIT grads if they make slight course changes to account for the fact that students are now expected to take in 7 courses of online lecture materials on their own.\n\nAbsolutely no one thinks that universities are devaluing their students' degrees with the accommodations they are making. Do you honestly believe employers are now gonna go \"Wow, I'm not gonna hire that UBC or UofT graduate and instead hire BCIT graduates because BCIT didn't change their grading policy during the pandemic. Wow those universities are pampering, hand-holding and spoon feeding their students by allowing students to audit their classes\". Lmao get over yourself and your self-importance. Imagine being this delusional.\n\nWhat would have happened 20 years ago is absolutely irrelevant to this discussion. You are just sounding like the typical boomer \"back in my days we had it worse\". Just because something was worse in the past doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to improve the current situation to the best of our ability.\n\nGood for you for being able to transition so seamlessly to online learning and sitting in front of the computer for 70 hours a week. If you honestly think that it's unfair for the school to make accommodations for students who can't adapt as easily as you can in perhaps the most drastic thing to have ever happened over the last 20 years, you should probably work on your EQ rather than school work.

Most people understand dealing with things as necessary. \n\nBCIT should be able to make exceptions in an exceptional time such as this.

Like what if I cant go to school because I need to get a job working anywhere because now I have to provide for my family instead of them providing for me while I am at school. This event has caused alot of people to loose thier jobs and are now on some sort of quarantine. So other members of thier family has to pick up the slack. School is important but sometimes other things are more important and it's not like were on some crazzy holiday and party. There is literally nothing to do but work or school or go to a mcdonalds drive through. I get that we are getting some sort of relief from the government but what if it's not enough.  I strongly feel like BCIT should allow certain exceptions during this time. I do appreciate them showing effort and compassion. And I get that things are overwhelming. The system is overloaded or at max capacity. I know reddit is not gonna solve anything but I just need to vent and reddit is the only place where I am getting any feedback or relatable conversation. This is shit is bananas.",

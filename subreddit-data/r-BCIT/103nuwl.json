Essentially anything to get the foot in the door, because if you have no job experience or any projects under your belt, it'll be an uphill struggle. School projects don't count and contradicting myself; To a lesser extend personal projects, they are more like conversational pieces at an interview, but only if they are relevant to the job. If you're applying fir a devops position... build a discord bot and host it on AWS, far more impressive than a board game where the former, you show the initiative to learn about relevant skills, the  latter is more like a fun but irrelevant project.\n\nIf you've built a network before grad, it helps even more. Many places offer bonuses for referrals, so your cohorts have an incentive to bring in friends and classmates.\n\nNevermind the coding interview if you can't even get a call back from a recruiter, they look for hard skills to check off and ask probing questions, brush up on them and be prepared to answer questions; You can't lie on a resume, if you put a hard skill I'm looking for and you can't answer a basic question related to it, I instantly know you lied on the resume.\n\nIf you do get a coding interview, prioritize getting it done vs looking fancy, nobody expects a junior to rattle off a merge sort, only as long as they can communicate clearly what their thoughts are as they are solving the problem.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019m about to graduate from UBC with a degree I don\u2019t have much interest in anymore and was looking at the CST program at BCIT (I know, everyone here is only asking questions about CST/CIT, I\u2019m sorry!). I was just wondering if anyone can give me some insight about the program and if I\u2019m actually fit for it. \n\n1. I have barely any experience in coding aside from a beginners UBC course I did in 2022 that only taught Python (CPSC 103) which I got a 92 in. I really enjoyed the class but I know coding and programming isn\u2019t as easy as that class made it out to be. I also did computing classes in grade 11 and 12 but have barely any recollection about them. How would someone who has little to no experience in coding do in this class? \n\n2. I also didn\u2019t do that great in differential/integral calculus at UBC but received a 90+ in Pre-Calc 12 so I\u2019m curious about how difficult the math is in these courses. That class was also done nearly 5 years ago in high school so considering that, how do you think a student will perform with mid/average math skills?\n\n3. I\u2019m a pretty big introvert and can be a little timid when it comes to presentations/speeches, is there a lot of public speaking in this program?\n\nAgain, sorry for asking questions on a program that everyone asks about but I just want to make sure I\u2019m making the right choice considering how much time/money I\u2019ve spent doing my Bachelors. I\u2019m also interested in the CIT program so I wouldn\u2019t mind insight about that program too! Thanks so much in advance :)",

            "comment": "I'm in the program right now.\n\n1) Probably 2/3rds of the people coming in have limited to no experience in coding. If you have python experience, aim for downtown campus where they learn python in first semester as opposed to java at burnaby.\n\n2) Calculus is irrelevant in CST, they don't teach it at all at far as I'm aware. First semester math course is number base systems and how they relate to comp sci, boolean algebra, and high school level linear algebra + logarithms. The second semester is discrete math. The third semester has a probability/stats class, haven't taken this yet but given the lack of pre-requisite material covered and the fact that they are cramming prob and stats into one class, it is almost definitely a light, non-calculus-based course versus the type of probability and stats that a STEM major would typically be doing.\n\nedit: To answer your question better, you will be fine first semester and third. Proof-based mathematics may throw you off in the second semester but that is a completely separate skill than the calculus courses you did. You have plenty of time to familiarize yourself with proof techniques before you encounter discrete math.\n\n3) A good chunk of the people in the program are introverted, but there are definitely some public speaking aspects of the program. Nobody likes doing it but it is super important to get comfortable with it, just bite the bullet and get out of your comfort zone. It will pay off when you are interviewing for jobs.",

Good luck in the rest of the program! :)",

I was very good with excel and I'd made a lot of macros for various games, so I understood the concept of if statements and loops.\n\nI had no math background. I hadn't done math since grade 11. I did the 'catchup' exam and got the absolute minimum required to enter the program. I still got through all the math classes. Hardest thing I had to do was matrix multiplication. I still don't understand it. I've also literally never used it. Sometimes I use boolean algebra for complex if statements.\n\nThere is a LOT of public speaking in the program. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD AVOID. If you want to progress in any career you need to become comfortable standing up in front of a group of peers and managers and defending your decisions on a project. Want to know the difference between a grad who gets 60K and 90K? The latter knows how to speak well in front of a group of interviewers.",

            "comment": "Coming from me a recent graduate...\n\n1.) Sounds like you have more experience than I did when I first entered. You should be fine. The first language they teach is Python. You will feel like you are reviewing for the first half of first term Python if not the entire term.\n\n2.) There won't be any calculus first nor second year. The math courses were alright for me. Some people struggled and some people did well. But no calculus. There was some linear algebra, log, exponents, graphs and probability. So things you did in high school but more advanced. \n\n3.) Projects in general. In your ISSP projects you will have to come out of your shell a bit. That being said, most of the people in the program are like introverted. You will simply learn to have to speak up when you need to. So this won't be an issue. Classes are small, so you're not looking at 300 people you have to present to. \n\nCIT would be a lot easier and not really be on coding. It is an entirely different field. You will be dealing with tech but just not from the programming stage, but more of a software stage. Using applications and etc.\n\nAnyway, I suggest you go do UBC's post degree program instead. If I had a degree I would go through that route. But if BCIT is your choice, then just be prepared for workload. BCIT is not a hard school. It is a 3 year diploma CONDENSED into 2 years. So just be prepared to study late nights early mornings. That's just how BCIT is. Oh btw, a lot of people leave messages on discord and other services so if you are shy to talk I am sure you can still ask questions from classmates.",

It's a plus that will make your first semester easier, but it's not needed.\n\nThere is no calculus unless you continue onto the bachelor degree after completing CST. Even then, it's one class that combines calculus with some other easier math, and the teacher is great.\n\nThere is not a lot of public speaking, but there are project presentations. Honestly, it's a good experience to have. It's not \"useless\" speaking, it's the type that genuinely comes up in the job when you demo a product to your managers and clients. It's not over the top though and nothing to worry about.\n\nPro tip as a ex-peer tutor: Peer tutoring in the library is free, and a great way to meet classmates from other sets. If you struggle in any class, I highly recommend you go to the library and ask when the CST peer tutoring is. Not enough people take advantage of it.\n\nCheers and good luck if you go for CST!",

            "comment": "Assuming you met the requirements without your SFU courses (eg, you have the required highschool math and physics) it doesn't matter that you've failed out of SFU.\n\nOne thing to consider though is why you failed at SFU.\n\nI have a university degree and have also taken trade school for electrical.  Trade school isn't a walk in the park either.  For electrical, you will need to do some math and physics and will have to have decent reading comprehension to learn the Canadian Electrical Code.\n\nDon't make the mistake of assuming trade school is easy.  Electrical has an extremely high drop out rate after first year because the school gets increasingly difficult.",

Though, it was a learning experience and there is a lot of things you have to come to grips with. \n\nHow are your studying habits? Are you good at managing deadlines? When you don't get something, do you ask for help?\n\nBCIT is demanding and it needs your full effort from start to finish. If you are getting kicked out of SFU you need to have the motivation to succeed after.",

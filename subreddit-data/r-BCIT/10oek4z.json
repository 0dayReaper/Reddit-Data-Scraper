But have confidence you will find a job, and the worst case scenario is your first job pays less than you want, and in 1-2 years you hop to somewhere you're happier with.\n\nMany of my friends did not do co-op or get summer jobs, and arguably the most successful of the batch didn't. He focused on his resume, his interview prep, and landed a quality job pretty quickly.\n\nNow I'm a project guy, and I recommend if you don't do co-op, spend your summer working on projects, such as building your website in React, building Android/iOS apps, whatever. Just learning new skills, no matter how scary it might feel. The worst case scenario is you become a better developer and don't feel confident sharing your work, the best case scenario is you become better and get to share your work.",

Most people here will only tell you the good stuff. But you have to hear about the bad stuff. Go look at the graduation outcomes. The people that do well, will respond. The people that won't, probably don't. Or the people that do extremely horrible will. Instead of worrying about not getting a job that easily like your friends, classmates or some alumni. Focus on what you can do now to stand out. \n\nI am off to doing what I can. Wish me luck. Good luck to you too.",

For Co-op, certainly you can use it as an experience to write on your resume. But I know a few classmates right now that have Co-op experience that still haven't gotten the developer job they want. One of my classmates that got a dev job, his Co-op was more quality assurance versus the other guys that actually programmed and coded in Web Development and Mobile Development. But yeah, I have a feeling those guys will get a job before I do. But that's just speculation. The market is highly competitive at the moment. \n\nAnyway thanks, though it probably will depend more on luck at this point. AI Scanning Resumes have...taken over. LOL.",

I saw on LinkedIn some people in Programming Paradigms have one of the best jobs. But at the same time some people in my set in Web and Mobile got pretty good jobs too. \n\nUltimately it is the amount of work you put in it and how passionate you are. You may or may not want to go into AI/Machine Learning as that is the latest hot spot right now. But the chances of your option making you stand out that much more than others is not what you should depend on as most people will settle or go for the jobs that are most readily available. \n\nThe advantage for Combined Web and Mobile is that you will know Mobile Dev more and the Microsoft Web Development (.NET) more than other majors. If web is what you are looking for this may be the best option. (Though I think increasingly the FSWD program is overshadowing the Combined Web and Mobile Option, as that entire program focuses only on web development so you will certainly learn a lot more web programming there.) But remember CST sets you up for possible Bachelors/Technology in the future and you will have an easier time switching back to traditional programming. Ultimately, build projects. Start small. And go big. Stay motivated. Don't start late like me.",

That itself is pretty much a market. From what I am seeing on job descriptions...\nC / C++ is a market of its own, embedded markets love this \nJava is a market of its own or is solely a backend mixed with JS\nPython is similar to Java's market.\nJavaScript is a market of its own if you do MERN or MEAN \nC#, .NET is usually a combination between JavaScript Frontend\nPHP is alive, not as well paid. But the market is still there.\nGo and Rust - the new market, that I don't think BCIT teaches. \nRuby surprisingly not that popular now, it was the go to. \n\nI think it is important for you to stick with something you find the most natural. I do think C++ would be an advantage as it has a large market. I didn't take C++ because our term did Python. I think Python is easier to learn but C++ isn't as easy. Syntax makes things more challenging. If you like JavaScript, make sure you play with ReactJS and NodeJS and even NextJS. I didn't get to practice those as much.\nAnyway, knowing what I know now I might have been better if I just joined FSWD. But yeah, it is important that you are able to show your work. JS is important is because you can show a visual website. That being said, you can embed Java if you want. I am not sure about C++ and others but make sure you try to stick with a few technologies you're good at and NOT try to be good at all of them.",

In fact, I'd probably say pick the school that has the lowest co-op entry grade requirements (C.I.T had about 88~ for Winter 2022, CST probably more) when choosing where to apply, if possible.\n\nBut getting another diploma/degree because you missed your chance at BCIT? Absolutely not! You already have an education and should be leveraging your personal projects and/or industry projects included in your curriculum. Yes it may be harder, but it's still possible.",

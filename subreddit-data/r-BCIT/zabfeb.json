Some are available for general loan and others are available through course reserves. For example, [Physics, Principles with Application, 7th Edition](https://go.exlibris.link/ckSgkjsH) is available for four-hour loan. I don't know if the specific ones you're looking for are available, but I encourage everyone to check. We buy them so you don't have to!",

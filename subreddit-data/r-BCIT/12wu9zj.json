I learned how to program and build robotic arms, pneumatic systems, hydraulics, electronic, etc. The job field is interesting but seems to require luck. My program was a 2 year program and I basically became a mechanic for robots/machines/systems. The pay has never been great, not bad but not good. Also not much room for growth in any company I\u2019ve been in.",

I have a 2 year technician certification which given the right circumstances technologist should have a bit more pay because that title is higher, but that again completely depends on what you end up doing.\n\nBest advice I can give is aim for a job. if that job/field requires this diploma then this is the way.\n\nPeople I went to school with have ended up all over the place job wise. From forklift, heavy equipment mechanics to factory maintenance (on robots)\n\nI haven\u2019t struggled to find work but some jobs are terrible and some are easy, there is no standard",

Not sure if BCIT has a mechatronics team for Skills Canada competitions but worth looking into because people usually get jobs after if they do well.",

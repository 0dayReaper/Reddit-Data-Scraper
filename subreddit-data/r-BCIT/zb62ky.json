    "postText": "Hey everyone ! I'll be attending BCIT in May 2023 and I'll be taking the New Media and Web Development program. I realize there will probably be a heavy lean to either Mac or Windows. Just curious if anyone has any info on which would be best for the program or if it's mostly personal preference. Not sure what the ratio is like. Any experiences or advice is welcome. Thanks !",

Instructors also base their teachings off the macs but will usually mention the windows equivalent(like photoshop shortcut keys). If you're tech savvy you'll be able to keep up no matter what, but if that might be a concern then go mac to be safe. I personally use the school Macs when I'm there than I swap to my PC at home.",

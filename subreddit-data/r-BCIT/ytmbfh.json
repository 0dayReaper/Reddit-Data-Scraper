    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nAs part of a story for BCIT News in the Broadcast and Online Journalism program, I'm conducting a survey on the produce consumption by students at the institution.\n\nIf you're a student at BCIT and have a quick second, I'd love for you to fill out a survey about your current consumption of fruits and vegetables while attending school. It's anonymous and only three questions; all multiple choice.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/EMxVFa3UoBgt71uF9",

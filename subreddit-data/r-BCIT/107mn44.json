I make $112k now. During those 4 years I got a handful of certs and moved towards a cloud (AWS) role. Hopping through a couple companies. \n\nMost peers got a help desk job at first, then either moved on to IC roles like network/linux/windows/cloud admin, or managerial roles like service/product/engineering managers. CISA teaches you the basics of many fields to specialize in. So it\u2019s really up to you to make the most of the program and learn it on the job and/or on your free time. \n\nThe trend right now is I see is automation, so working with infrastructure as code. If you really don\u2019t pick up scripting, then it\u2019ll be hard to grow as most companies are looking for people who can do some scripting. \n\nIT is a field that constantly evolves. If you\u2019re not keeping up in the latest trends, you\u2019ll get stuck. So you have to constantly study/learn/get certifications throughout your lifetime if you want to make it. It\u2019s usually the passionate people who climbs.",

Between graduation and now which certs did you achieve?  Can CISA grads move into DevOps roles after a few years of experience?",

I worked with someone with a boatload of certs in his email signature and couldn\u2019t generate a key and SSH into a system. \n\nMy 2 cents, you\u2019ll see \u201cDevOps\u201d Engineer roles everywhere. The trap is that \u201cDevOps\u201d to a lot of companies is wanting to pay a single salary for a network admin, a programmer, and a sysadmin, who will be on call 24/7. So I\u2019d rather focus on finding a role in a company that embraces DevOps in their culture and infra. Even if it\u2019s not a \u201cDevOps\u201d role, it\u2019ll be easier to pick up DevOps practices and skills there.",

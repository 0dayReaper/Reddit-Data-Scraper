    "postText": "So for context, I have an AS in Sociology I did at a community college and was thinking about taking the CST program at BCIT. However, I know it is a rigorous program. I was wondering if anyone has experience going into the program with minimal compsci experience. Im doing the CS50 course at the moment to get a feel of computer science and see how I do with it as well as taking notes and practicing from whatever video lessons I can find. Other than that, I didnt take any compsci courses in secondary school or college. Does it put me at a major disadvantage compared to others in the CST program or will I still do well given I put in the work? Would you say the CST program is beginner friendly and has adequate resources to help those of my background? Im kind of afraid to make the switch. Thanks in advance",

I tried to complete CS50, but didn\u2019t even get past the first assignment on Scratch. I know some people who completed several CS courses prior, or even a whole bootcamp and they didn\u2019t make co-op. Don\u2019t worry about it too much and do your best.",

            "comment": "You have two options, Full-time CST or the Part-time laderize program for CST.\n\nFull-time is very competitive and coop is really an advantage. You can finish CST in 2 years without coop or 3 years with coop. If money and living expenses are not your concern and you know you can be in a competitive nature then by all means go Full-time\n\nPart-time is not as competitive as Full-time, it's like competitiveness is not really a thing. But the advantage is you can do courses at your own pace. And of course you can work while you study. If you need money and you have other responsibilities maybe consider part-time. It's longer than full-time but it will be up to you and right planning if you want to fast-track Part-time\n\nAs for me, I am a part-time student taking the ladderize program that takes 4-5 courses per term. With my load, your worry is not competing with your fellow students but with yourself. 4-5 courses in Part-time is equivalent to a full-time load, that is if you are also working full-time.\n\nOne thing you might want to consider, you can do Part-time up until CSC if you are still not sure and don't really care about coop. After getting CSC you can transfer to FT at 3rd term to finish the remaining courses for diploma in just under a year. But doing this option will depend on the availability of the seats in the 3rd term which is also a bit competitive since a good number of students are doing this option.",

Also when you said 4-5 classes part time is equivalent to full time if you are also working full time, do you mean like if you also have a job outside of school?",

Technically, based in the program head of Part-time studies. Taking 1-2 courses with full time job is common, 3 courses with full time job is heavy already, more than 3 with full time is really pushing it and a lot of times those who are taking more than 3 are doing part-time job instead.",

You will be competing with other people for the coop program which can easily secure you into entry level jobs. If you fail to get into coop, your basically competing with people outside of BCIT into securing an entry level job.",

I've always been familiar with a computer basic office/excel or if there's a hybrid computer trade program that I have not seen yet. \n\nThank you for reading!",

I don't know what the current system is like (I entered the program in 2010) but my high school grades didn't matter because I was 30 and qualified as a mature student. reach out to the registrar's office and set up a meeting with someone who can walk you through things.",

    "postText": "Looking for input from anyone who has enrolled in the distance learning program for 1st class. Has the course been a good resource/benefit to your career, or do you feel like it is more work than is necessary? My main reason for enrolling is two-part, the primary is to gain good insight/experience from an accredited and alternate source other than PanGlobal strictly, and the secondary is to benefit from the reduction in steam time required for 1st class. From what I understand the assignments are sent to you and you mail them in to be marked. In terms of work load, how much time did it take you to complete each paper and how much time were you dedicating on a daily basis. And finally last question is how did the in house examinations compare in difficulty/structure to the provincial 1st class exams. Thanks for taking the time to read and looking forward to hearing some replies.",

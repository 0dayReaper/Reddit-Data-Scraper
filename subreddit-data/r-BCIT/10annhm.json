    "postText": "Hi, I'm posting this in the few bigger post secondary educations subs since I couldn't find one about them all. I'm wanting to enrol into a UX/UI (or any webdev) programs (might not be BCIT, a few of the UX/UI courses are full, not sure how to work that out, if anyone knows) and looking for a shared rental, preferably to be with other students at BCIT or any other post secondary. My deadline is the end of January so if anyone is looking for roommates or looking at renting a house please let me know, and as well as any other questions if you have any. If not then I have been messaging shared rentals on Facebook, albeit having not too much success with finding suitable ones but there are a few. Or if there is anyone looking for March or any other time like that. Thanks!",

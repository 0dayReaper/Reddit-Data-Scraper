    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI am a graduate of BSc in Electrical Engineering, I have 4 years of Project management experience in an IT organization.\n\nI need some technical experience in IT, is it good to apply for the diploma of CIT in BCIT, or do I have to look for a Graduate diploma. \n\nIn other words will having a diploma after bachelors degree affect my CV. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you,",

            "comment": "Lots of EE/math/physics grads just self study tech and are able to get developer jobs if that's what you want to do. With an EE degree you already have the fundamentals down. Maybe a shorter certificate from BCIT would be a better use of your time: [https://www.bcit.ca/programs/software-systems-developer-web-programmer-option-certificate-full-time-699ccertt/](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/software-systems-developer-web-programmer-option-certificate-full-time-699ccertt/)\n\nhaving a diploma after a BSc isn't a negative on your CV though, if that's what you're asking",

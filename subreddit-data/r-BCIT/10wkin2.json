            "comment": "Hello Burnerreddit19! I hope you don't delete this account anytime soon because people in this subreddit will try to help you in the future.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nI am a marketing management communications alumni of 2022. It's true, the MarComm program is tough. The courses aren't hard but the work load in your 2 years of BCIT will be a challenge. A lot of people in this subreddit recently are worried about the programs before heading into BCIT. This is a repost of my comment (with an added bonus tip for MarComm students) in one of the threads from last week but here are my 6 tips to help you become a top performer at BCIT: \n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n1) This is an obvious but effective tip. Time management. Use google calendar to align all of your course load and school info just to save up a lot of time. Usually in between breaks, my classmates and I would try to finish our assignment that's due the week after. Finding the small window of time and do as much as possible. Efficiency is key in this program.\n\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n2) Make as many friends as possible. Not only just for networking but they will help you in the long run throughout your journey at BCIT. If you offer help to your peers, they will return the favour and they will make your life a lot easier as you make theirs. It's really cringe for me to say this but it's true; teamwork makes the dream work.\n\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n3) There are tons and I mean TONS of work management softwares for you to use to help you list out your tasks like Asana, Wrike, Notion, etc. Being organized is such an under-looked skill in BCIT but it was a game changer for me once I started using these softwares. This is completely optional. Do what works best for you.\n\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n4) Communicate as much as possible with your set and your groupmates. I can't speak on the behalf of the new media design program but you'll have a bunch of team assignments and some professors will give out vague instructions. Usually unclear assignments will result in your professor's inbox being flooded with emails so it's better to ask your \"smart\" set mates or set reps for clarity of the assignments. It's best to ask right away rather than asking later.\n\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n5) Make sure sleep regularly. Trust me. You don't want to pull an all-nighter before the day of an important presentation, mid term or final exam. Once you pull an all-nighter, chaos ensues. You'll be tired to go to lecture, you'll be less focused on lessons and the worst part is that your work load is going to pile up the moment in what feels like in instant.\n\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n6) This is so huge and **Do**. **Not**. **Underestimate**. the power of **networking**. Right now, some graduates are having trouble looking for a marketing related role simply because the job market is more competitive than ever due to the economy right now. I am not trying to scare you. Right now, you have an opportunity at BCIT to network with professors, with other students, and clients that you will meet. Try to stand out as much as you can and work as hard as possible. All of your efforts will be rewarded by the end of the program\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you may already know, some of these answers are obvious and straight forward but it's often overlooked. Most importantly, HAVE FUN! Grades aren't everything because a bunch of numbers on your transcript will not dictate your future. I can't stress enough but go in the program with the mentality to learn as much as possible. With that kind of mindset, grades will follow along.\n\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\nI hope you will have a fun time at BCIT and create memorable moments that you can share with your future boss and co-workers. I wish you the best.",

Rather than being fixated on the hardship of the program, you should look forward to the glory of what you will end up with: developed business professional skills, an established network, a new friend group, and fun memories.",

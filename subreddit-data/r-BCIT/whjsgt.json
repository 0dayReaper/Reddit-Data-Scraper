I have courses completed through a certificate I finished that also are part of other programs I\u2019m planning on applying for.",

You declare your intended program - https://www.bcit.ca/admission/how-to-apply/program-declaration/\n3. You finish all of the required courses and apply for a credential - https://www.bcit.ca/files/records/pdf/appl_4_credential.pdf\n\nCourses from program X can be applicable to program Y.  For example, I started with ACIS and ASD, both of which contained courses applicable for CSC.  All of this is applicable for CST.",

I\u2019m just slightly confused because the next certificate I\u2019m wanting to finish must be applied for rather than declared, and I\u2019m already ~80% complete the courses required. So it will work a similar way where the credits for those completed courses will apply to the program once I\u2019m approved?",

    "postText": "A while back there was an anonymous post about CST instructor Arron Ferguson on this subreddit:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BCIT/comments/jkfjwb/java\\_with\\_arron\\_exp\\_future\\_cst\\_students\\_click\\_here/\n\nWhile this post was expressed awkwardly, the sentiment is valid. Nearly all other CST students I know would agree with me that Arron Ferguson is a downright terrible CST instructor.\n\nMany students have completely given up on paying attention to his lectures because they are so poor.\n\nIt often appears that Arron is viewing his slides for the first time in years as he shows them to us. Frequently while going through them he finds errors that require correcting on the spot. At other times he gets lost in his own slides or examples and has to stumble through sections until he finds the slide or code he was looking for.\n\nLectures are not structured in a meaningful way around topics. Looking at the course outline every week has a set of topics that will be covered, but I don\u2019t feel that many of these things have been included in his lectures other than being referenced very briefly. Instead of making it clear that we are discussing topic x, Arron will dance around the abstract idea of x without even mentioning it, then claim that we already talked about x. \n\nComparing his lectures to other instructors who put in the time to do a good job of preparing, structuring, and teaching the material - the difference is night and day.\n\nMeanwhile, lab and assignment documents, like his lectures, constantly have misleading errors in them. The labs and assignments are very clearly being recycled from previous years, which is fine, but if so why are the errors and typos not being fixed? Even more frustrating is that the labs and assignments do not do a good job of teaching us the learning outcomes and preparing for the exams. \n\nThere are plenty of other negative things to say. Arron is very particular about code style for our submissions but breaks many of these style rules in his own example code. He\u2019s rude in emails and communicates poorly with students. We don\u2019t get ANY feedback on labs, assignments, or exams, and asking for feedback can lead to an impolite reply. In general Arron\u2019s reply to most requests is that he doesn\u2019t have time to deal with it.\n\nArron, I know you browse this subreddit sometimes. If you are reading this, I want you to know that you are making the learning experience markedly worse for many CST students. You are making people unhappy. You are bad at your job. \n\nFree online resources are infinitely better at teaching the learning outcomes than your classes, yet we have to waste our time and money dealing with you because you teach several core courses in the cst program.\n\nYes the online classes environment can be difficult for both students and instructors, but it is blatantly obvious that you don\u2019t even make an effort to try to be a good teacher, and previous students have been complaining about your classes long before COVID. If you don\u2019t care about how your students are doing and only teach for the money, you\u2019re a dick.  I really can't imagine that this is the case, but if you are somehow trying your best and are just struggling, I'm sorry, but maybe this just isn't the job for you.\n\nIf you think that this is just one irritated student and that the opinion is not commonly held, you are wrong. There is plenty of information available online that can vouch for that.\n\nFrustrating that BCIT has such low standards for some instructors. Arron has been teaching at BCIT for 20+ years, has received many complaints along the way, yet the school does nothing to intervene.\n\nNot sure what else to do about this besides venting on reddit.",

Thankfully, that skill will help you plenty down the line.\n\nAs much as I dislike Arron's teaching style, he is far from the worst when it comes to instructors. In my opinion, there are other instructors that are far more deserving of being canned, yet it can take very literal years for BCIT to do anything about them.\n\nWhat can ya do.",

Things can't change without doing something about it, just not sure what the right thing to do is.",

There are good comp sci/ dev teachers and programs that exist out there, why should CST get a free pass to be bad just because it's the status quo?  Sure the program has a pretty good reputation within BC and can help land a job, but does that excuse the shitty instructors?\n\n I don't think so at least",

            "comment": "I really find this opinion of Arron to be popular, but misguided. \n\nI know some people who already have this negative opinion of him will already roll their eyes to that, but let me try to explain.\n\nWeb Dev in particular is strange to teach. The literal only way to teach some parts of it is to simply list out common attributes, tags and properties and to sample what's available. Think about it, what other way can you reasonably explain what tags are? You have to simply describe what it is, how it relates to other tags,  where to use it in what order, move on to the next tag.\n\nWell what about javascript, jquery, DOM, etc? \nThe same thing applies, web is fundamentally about getting and showing information, and the way you teach that is just showing examples of different scenarios of how that's done. I admit, this is not particularily engaging. Arron actually admits how painful it is to manually do these things, but he even tells you why you do it, it's the closest way to manipulate these properties using JS or Jquery, and is to develop your muscle memory for interacting with these fundamental properties.\n\nSome web dev problems are just braindead, just look up the tag or issue you have, in a basic course, everything was just a search away. I understand the professor is here to facilitate that knowledge, but it would literally take longer to get up and ask arron, than it would be to solve most of the problems present in 1537. If you think the issues present in this course are difficult without an instructor explaining the nuance of every single piece of code, this program will be immensely difficult as you start to begin projects that require you to adapt to new ways of code quickly.\n\nNext is just my personal experience, i'm not really using it to justify any particular teaching style. As a \"passive-listen\" type of student i just like listening to some basics, and then when it's time to grind on some assignment, just look up the thing that he taught, apply it in some way and that's how I learn best. Arron was fine from my experience. Got a great mark at the end even paying attention to his lectures 15% of the time and downloading his notes for use in labs / assignments.\n\nHis labs and communication were quite honestly fine imo, if you approached him with particular niche web dev interest things, like different framework advice, he actually came back with some great advice and perspective. I really don't understand how some people could have such drastically different interpretations of his communication style, some people have 0 problems, and others catastrophize in these posts. There must be something wrong here if that's the case.\n\n\nI also really think it's unrealistic to assume that listening to lectures is the most optimal way to learn how to do web dev. It's just 1/8th of the learning process. I think it's unrealistic to label him as a \"bad instructor\" without the perspective of having to know where the knowledge of this course actually fits into your soon-to-be storied career as a developer, you might forget about this course years from now, but if you look back, I think you will find that the material cannot, CANNOT, be taught in many other ways. \n\nI hope you find the improvement you seek, I think listing some meaningful actions that arron could take would be better than just saying how bad he is.",

                    "comment": "I took his 1537 course already and didn't like him much there either, but currently my issue with him is in the second semester class java OOP.\n\nI agree, listening to lectures is just one part of the learning process, for any course.  But when the lectures are poor and unprepared, the labs/assignments are unhelpful, and Arron is unapproachable due to rude remarks and lack of feedback, these things combined all create a horrible learning experience.\n\nSeveral marked assignments/labs in this class have been about creating java programs with a focus on object oriented design.  One assignment for example we were provided a UML and asked to write the classes based on the diagram, which would then be marked solely based on checkstyle and provided unit tests.  The unit tests and UML diagram had different criteria though -  the unit tests used different methods and variables from the diagram, with many parts of the diagram unnecessary to pass the unit tests.  When asked about the discrepancies or questions about aspects of the UML diagram, Arron seemed annoyed and told us that he didn't have time to fix the assignment and to just follow the unit tests.  Other assignments and labs have had similar problems.\n\nStuff like this is indefensible imo - he took this job and gets paid a salary every year to do it.  \"Not having time\" to make slight adjustments to an assignment that in its current state is teaching POOR design, if anything, is not an option.\n\nAs for web dev all I know is that I got loads more out of textbooks and udemy than anything Arron did in that class.  Other cheaper, less time intensive resources seemed to have no problem teaching the material in ways that were engaging, easy to follow, etc.\n\nIt's insane to me that some will defend these instructors when a $15 udemy course or free youtube tutorial is so much more effective at teaching basic concepts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRE your last sentence: The purpose of this post was to blow off steam, but doubtful to me that listing meaningful actions will do anything anyway because I honestly don't think that Arron cares about the quality of his class.  When suggestions have been made he has condescendingly shrugged them off.   Students have complained about his teaching for years and clearly things have not changed.  I don't think he has any interest in changing because that would take extra work.  The man is in this for the bag and nothing else.\n\nSorry, not trying to be rude to you, just very frustrated with the situation and I have trouble understanding why someone would want to defend him",

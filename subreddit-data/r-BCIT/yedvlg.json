I'd say the program is very well designed,  but it's cut-throat and tough.\n\nPrepare to possibly feel like you're drowning at times; there are a lot of concepts that are going to be thrown at you *right away* \\- but it's a real struggle at first because you don't have the framework to place those ideas yet. Later on, you'll look back to that term and think \"how did I struggle? It should have been easy!\", but until you get that framework, it's very hard to know how all these different concepts you're going to learn relate.\n\nBut instructors hold your hand through it, even if you don't feel like they're doing that at the time. It's a very large workload, you probably won't have time for much work and will have to be stingy with your time. But that also depends on your expectations and whether you want to go into the engineering degree after or if you want to go the diploma route.\n\nOn the plus side, most of the instructors you have in first year are excellent. I don't want to scare you, you'll be absolutely fine.",

When actually saying \"hey any way to get notes or even a lesson plan ahead of time because I physically can't keep up\" I was told \"oh I don't really have notes in advance or a lesson plan\". Now that was an outright lie from James Doyle. I ended up purchasing a copy of the ITA binder and it was word for word exactly what he was saying and probably the papers he brought in with him to class. \n\nGo buy an ITA binder for each level and you'll probably be fine. Bcit doesn't like to use them because they want to pimp their own books and make it look like they're some prestigious institution when in reality it's a bunch of people who have a ticket and think that makes them qualified to teach.",

I realized early on that you get what you put into it, *especially* after joining co-op I found out that no one is responsible for your individual learning.  \n  \nI'm Sept 2020 intake for the CIT program, during the time I've had at BCIT, I've learned how to:  \n  \n1. Read documentation\n2. Find exactly what I'm looking for on Google\n3. Work quickly and efficiently individually and as a group\n4. Work under sleep deprivation\n5. Communicate effective\n6. Organize thoughts quickly to get my point across  \n7. Market myself in interviews to solve questions with the thought process that I've used in labs\n  \nI'm really happy with the education I've received at BCIT and acquiring the ability to learn how to learn effectively (on your own) will last a lifetime.",

You just sort of have to suffer through it and collect as much information as you can from textbooks and youtube videos.\n\n\\- Asking questions is a great way to slow teachers down. And don't let them fob you off with \"we'll come back to that\". keep hammering them with questions.\n\n\\- Ultimately, you can speak to your program head. I had a teacher who would essentially do nothing but read from a power point presentation that the textbook had provided, then end class a half hour early so we could study on our own\". I told my program head I wasn't paying out the ass for a talking dummy and free time.",

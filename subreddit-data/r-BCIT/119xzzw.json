    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI was wondering if anyone can tell me about Research Methodology &amp; Measurement Models.\n\nI looked up the instructor Joe Ilsever on rate my prof and am now terrified to take this course with others. I am only a part time student and so am debating if i should wait until the fall when it could be my only class to do it.\n\nCan anyone here speak to the difficulty of the course or Joe, and what their experiences were like taking it online?\n\nThanks,",

            "comment": "I didn't like Joe. He's old, impatient, misogynistic, and rather unpleasant.\n\nWhen I took the course, there were no requirements. When I showed up there was an expectation that I knew statistics and that I had a laptop. I had neither so things were difficult.\n\nStand your ground. Joe acts like an old school professor, where he's a god and students have to beg for scraps. But end of day, he's an employee, and you're a customer. If something is wrong, say so. If you need help, demand it. If things go sour, go above his head.\n\nI will say, I got through all my classes with Joe and he worked with me when things went sideways. He gave me, free of charge, an introduction to statistics textbook, to help catch me up. That was kind of him. He helped me pivot my grad project when the original concept fell through.\n\nIt's not a fun course and he's not a great teacher. But it's not 'hard' either.",

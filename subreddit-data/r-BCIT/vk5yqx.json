I know in Vancouver, only UBC, SFU and BCIT offer 4 year electrical engineering degree program and I have a few questions:\n\nIs BCIT's electrical engineering program a good program?\n\nIs it comparable to UBC/SFU's electrical engineering program?\n\nHow is the job prospect for BCIT's electrical engineers?\n\nAlso, if you have finished the program, do you have a related job now?\n\nAny feedback is welcomed! Thanks!!",

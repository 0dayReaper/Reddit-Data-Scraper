[https://www.bcit.ca/advising/contact-program-advising/](https://www.bcit.ca/advising/contact-program-advising/)\n\nOtherwise, I'd say you're probably fine. BCIT is easy to enter, hard to stay in. I'll also say this (and this is probably a bit cold), if you got those marks putting in a low-medium effort, or you are young, you are probably fine. If you were working your tail off and that's what you got in those courses, you'll likely find that program *extremely* challenging.",

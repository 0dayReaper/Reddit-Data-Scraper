Definitely depends on how much work each of your courses is, too.",

Sometimes I do three if they are all easy but if I\u2019m taking a harder one I just stick with two courses. I also find booking a day off work before an exam to have extra time to prep super helpful. Recommend balancing your load by taking a harder course with easier one if possible.",

I would not recommend taking more than 1 accelerated course while working full time. \n\nFor regular paced courses 2 - 3 is probably fine depending on the course. I would try to read the previous term's course outline to get an idea of the projects. If it's just chapter reading, quizzes and tests then could probably do 3 but if there are lot of projects and papers then 2.\n\nObviously everyone is different though. If it's your first time working and going to school at the same time, i would start off light and then if you feel like another course could have been added there's always next term. Dont over do it.",

Leave it out of your availability for work!",

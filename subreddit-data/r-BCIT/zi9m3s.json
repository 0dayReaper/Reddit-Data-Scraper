    "postText": "I am considering the CST full-time program at BCIT and am uncertain how to interpret the entrance requirements.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n1. I have been out of school for a couple years after completing a master's degree in an non-CS field but took a couple of elementary calculus courses and the required English courses in my undergrad. The GPA from my graduate degree shouldn't be a concern, but my grades in the calculus and English courses were poor.\n\n2. My high school equivalent of pre-calculus 12 from Alberta (Pure Math 30) is quite competitive but that's from a decade ago. English grades in high school were also poor.\n\nI am willing to upgrade course grades or retake post-secondary English and math courses to submit a competitive application but have no idea what the best course of action is. What is considered when BCIT looks at my application?  Do my high school grades even matter anymore? Is performance in my non-CS degrees considered?\n\nI am also looking at other CS programs around Canada and any insight into how schools treat entrance requirements for people like me would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "I would recommend emailing Student Information &amp; Enrollment Services ([askus@bcit.ca](mailto:askus@bcit.ca)), Stephanie ([cstdiploma@bcit.ca](mailto:cstdiploma@bcit.ca)) or [setting up an appointment with advising](https://www.bcit.ca/advising/) for clarification. The requirements frequently change, so it's best to ask BCIT staff directly. \n\nI would also recommend looking into the flexible learning programs, as they don't have an admissions process and you can still work while completing the certificates. If your bachelor's or master's is in a STEM or business field, it may have enough overlap that the [ASD](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/applied-software-development-asd-associate-certificate-part-time-6958acert/) or [AWD](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/applied-web-development-associate-certificate-part-time-6957acert/) certificates make more sense. It mostly depends on what career path in computing you're looking at. For part-time programs, you can email [cstpts@bcit.ca](mailto:cstpts@bcit.ca) for more information.\n\nFor tax purposes, be sure to look into the [Canada Training Credit](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/federal-government-budgets/budget-2019-investing-middle-class/canada-training-credit.html).",

Most of programming task is done alone and involve many hours of deep thoughts, is that what you enjoy? Do you enjoy logical thinking? You can think of programming as writing instructions for the most stupid person on Earth who would do exactly what you written. Even, it makes no sense and would crash the system.\n\n  \nIn terms of math and other sciences, I think a lot of people get low score because they are not taught and motivated properly by their teachers and they just try to apply formulas blindly. I think most 1st calculus and linear algebra are taught that way and you just have to deal with it. Luckily unless you specialize in computer graphics, VR or ML you don't need much math for day to day work.\n\n  \nAlso, there are other field in CS other than programming, for example technical writing, project and product management. However, for PM most shops prefer the PMs have some technical background. Most of my project managers are former programmers.",

I have been reviewing what I should have learned in those calculus courses and some introductory CS stuff via Brilliant and have really liked it. In this respect, I enjoy logical thinking unless you mean something else or something broader. It's definitely something I've sorely missed studying music.\n\nUnsure still about what field within CS, but it all seems like what I would enjoy exploring more/being in the learning environment for.\n\nWhat's your background and why are you in CS if you don't mind?",

I don't like my career choices in math so I get CST diploma from BCIT. After that, I mostly just read cs books and learn from varies online sources. When I first take cs at SFU, I don't like it as much so I didn't get a cs degree. Going back I should have done at least a minor in cs. Now, the world is quite different and there are even more free and high quality cs learning material and makes a cs degree less valuable. However, people are biased by a cs degree from Waterloo with lots of fancy coop terms.\n\nAfter BCIT, I joined some game start up, working in industry then back to games. I have coworkers that never graduate university and just demonstrate their technical skill with personal projects and just a lot of know stuff.\n\nYour responds indicates you are more than equipped mentally to work in the field. I don't know if you would enjoy making cs your career for many years, you have to consider your personality, how you like to work (group/solo) and your interest. I was single and played a lot of video games so it is fit. If you like to learning constantly and are curios, you will do well. You will need to constantly learn new things as you progress in your career. You definitely won't get bored if you are keen. However, it is also pressure to keep up or be left behind or become a manager.\n\nThe pay is generally attractive but the hours are long. As a starting programmer that is learning your way and trying to impress, I expect you to work ~60 hours a week. You can earn even more if you are willing to leave Vancouver or Canada. But, that's later down the road. Most fields require some field of computer programming: finance, interactive entertainment, industries, medicine... You can find a field that interest you the most and look for work there.",

    "postText": "I tried applying to full-time CST but my recent results weren't positive (probably because of my IELTS result isn't high enough) so I'd like to take BCIT's English upgrading course since I'm PR who didn't study two years of full-time high school in English speaking country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/#entry](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/#entry)\n\nAs written in link above, I require English 12 score. And as BCIT upgrading courses, there are COMM 0005/0015 and COMM 0030/0033.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQ1. Are both mandatory to achieve English requirement? Or does taking only one matter?\n\nQ2. My IELTS score is Listening 7.0, Reading 6.5, Writing 5.5, Speaking 7.0. COMM 0005 says its prerequisite is 6 in IELTS reading writing, COMM 0030 says its prerequisite is 6 in IELTS listening speaking. Am I qualified for COMM 0005? Can it be rounded to be accepted?\n\nQ3. [https://www.bcit.ca/admission/entrance-requirements/english-requirements/](https://www.bcit.ca/admission/entrance-requirements/english-requirements/) From here, 90 (equivalent to BCIT\u2019s 86%) is the highest possible score for the COMM 0015 and 0033 assessments. Is it safely good for competition?",

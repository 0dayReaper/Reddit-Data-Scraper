    "postText": "My semester starts in Summer\u201923 and my course happens to be in Downtown Campus.\nAlthough I was hoping for a \u2018university campus\u2019 experience in Burnaby- it seems like I\u2019ll be exploring around the streets of Downtown.\n\nCan you guys list out the quirks of being in Downtown Campus so that it keeps the excitement alive!!\n\nP.S. Do help me decide a place to rent for the course duration. I heard Kitsilano is a cool place for students to live!? How easy is it to find good flatmates? Are there any unspoken flatmate rules that I should know as a Rookie?\n\nTIA",

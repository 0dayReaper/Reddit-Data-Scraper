    "postText": "Hello everyone! Is there anyone who studied or is currently studying in CIT or BITMAN?\n\nI am applying for the intake in the Sep 2023, but I can't decide which program is better for me. I'm interested in programming but not as heavily as students in CST program, and I minor in finance and fintech in university so I kinda want to combine my degree with my future learning. \n\nSo I want to ask,\n\n1. Is BITMAN program worth it? what is the program like? what people do after completing this program?\n2. I did some research about CIT program, and some people say it's too general compared with CST program, but the post was years ago. Does it have any difference now? is it a good program for people who have little knowledge in programming? (I have experience in using python for analysis and html, css, js for web development.)",

I studied mech eng tech and landed a job as a business analyst in a software development team. \n\nFor example, a software dev / CST grad can be a business analyst with minimal amount of prep, but a business analyst that wants to be a developer will need massive amounts of prep. \n\nDevelopers will be paid more than BAs with few exceptions. Less technical positions that pay well, e.g., product manager, will still require a higher  level of technical skills than a BA, which can be hard to gain on your own.",

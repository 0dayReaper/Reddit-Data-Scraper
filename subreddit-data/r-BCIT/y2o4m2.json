I have a job that requires me to travel out of town often and basically have no way to take cst without being online or quitting my job. I tried looking online but couldnt find any concrete answers on the website, gonna call admissions tomorrow. Thanks",

            "comment": "BCIT offers a Computer Systems Diploma through part-time studies which has remarkably similar coursework to the CST Diploma through full-time studies. It's a laddered credential, so you need to start with the Computer Systems certificate - [https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-certificate-part-time-5500cert/](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-certificate-part-time-5500cert/). Then you can progress to the diploma - [https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-diploma-part-time-5500pdiplt/](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-diploma-part-time-5500pdiplt/). Part-time studies courses are offered in the evenings and weekends. Although a plethora of online course offerings currently exist in the program, increasingly more of the coursework is shifting back to campus, so you will likely need to take at least some of your courses at either the Burnaby or Downtown Campus. When you call admissions, they will be able to provide more details on the planned delivery model for future terms.",

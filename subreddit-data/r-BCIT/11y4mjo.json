    "postText": "I'm about to finish my first course at BCIT, Math 0007 (Pre-Calculus 11) and I found the course quite simple. Can anyone who has done Math 0001 (Pre-Calculus 12) and 0007 share their experience on the difficulty between the two courses? I don't want to go into the course thinking its going to be as simple, and then it turns out to be the opposite. I need to make sure I get a good mark for Math 0007 so I can get into CST.\n\nFor reference, I had a C minus in Foundations of math in highschool, but I never really found math too difficult when I tried.",

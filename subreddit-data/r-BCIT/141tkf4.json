    "postText": "I am applying to BCIT's CST program for January 2024 after finishing at SFU, and I plan on using a **90%** in a Pre-Calculus 12 course I just took and an **A+** I achieved in a Communications course back in 2019.\n\nSFU only uses letter grades as official grades, crappy I know.\n\nI have sent probably about 5+ emails, all to different advisors and program heads, and no-one has been able to tell me what an A+ is considered as in terms of a percentage for applying. The grade equivalencies chart they have only goes up to an A grade too.\n\n**Can anyone here shine a light on what an A+ would be considered as, in terms of a percentage, when applying?**",

Explain that you've gone through multiple avenues, Program Advising, etc but couldn't get any clarification. My understanding is that the admissions officers are the ones who evaluate applications. (You are automatically assigned one once your application has been processed).\n\nIf that doesn't work, I don't think you'll get an answer anywhere. BCIT isn't the clearest when it comes to grade equivalencies which is problematic for competitive entry programs.",

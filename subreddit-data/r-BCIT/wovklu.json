However, landing a job at a unicorn or a medium-large tech company, will take a ton of out of school effort and is extremely competitive. Many Computer Science students at UBC and SFU are struggling as well.\n\nYou will need to prepare your resume with multiple personal projects and study for technical interviews in your free time (Leetcode style questions).\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the current economy is quite competitive for entry level tech jobs. As long as you\u2019re willing to spend the time to build up your profile and develop your skills outside of school, you should have no problems finding work. It won\u2019t be easy, but there are clear actionable steps that can make you a strong candidate to land that job. You can do this!",

It took 6 months, but I spent 3 months to study English. My English was really bad and I didn't even introduce myself at the first interview. However, I never gave up. Whenever I failed interview and found my weakness, I fixed it. For example, My first problem was English, so I scheduled 3 interviews every week just for speaking out. My second weakness was I have no experience in IT field, so I made my homepage, portfolios ,and PPT and present it in the interview, and I got hired. \n\nGetting hired is all about your desperation. If you never give up, you will get hired someday. sorry about my grammar ;)",

I heard many will find jobs as a construction project coordinator or building cost estimator, two jobs that you can get without any engineering or architecture background (but obviously they'd prefer that knowledge). \n\nBut these are entry level positions... all entry level positions suck. And for most people, that's where you start... millenials and zoomers are known for wanting to start as managers right after university, or after 6 months on the job. Right now with inflation it's kind of weird too how salaries are being compensated, because many employers haven't or can't keep up with market inflation. So right now salaries seem smaller than usual. But I think a CS student can at least bank on making 50K to 60K.... I have a coworker and he just graduated from CS at a university, and he's making like 45K doing a different job outside of CS, bit he's using his CS skills to add on his resume. I'm pretty sure his next job will be paying him 60K to 70K at least.",

When I try to re-register for the courses it won't allow me and shows a $0.00 charge. \n\nI'm ready to pay for tuition now and I can't call the student services line because it's closed. \n\nDo I have to call the student services in order to re-register again? I'm really flustered so thanks for any help.",

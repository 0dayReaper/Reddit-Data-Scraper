If you do it this way then just make sure you go to your bank and have your student ID number for BCIT as well as the exact cost of the application fee so they can send the money over. They should ask for your student ID and the exact cost and make sure you clarify that they are sending to BCIT just in case! Also it never hurts to bring a piece of ID in case they ask and get a receipt from the transaction.",

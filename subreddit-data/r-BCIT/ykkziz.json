    "postText": "I am in a bit of a puzzle. I have been accepted to both the Uvics Bachelor of Computer Science as well as the Bcit CST program and while Bcit is a 40 mins drive away I also want to experience life away from my parents for once. Also the Co-op experience is very important to me as I wish to have some work experience before graduation. I guess I am just asking for your opinions on which one I should pursue or simply pros and cons of both. Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Personally I prefer BCIT if you decide to stay in BC after graduating. You will be paying 3x the amount of money going to uvic. You pay for living on campus for 4 years and pay for a 4 year degree. \n\nBCIT allows you to be flexible. You can move out for a year and if you hate it or can\u2019t afford to pay for it. You can move back in with your parents.\n\nCoop and networking are important and much better at BCIT if you want to stay in Vancouver. Many SWEs at FAANG in Vancouver went to bcit.\n\nHowever at the end of the day, a 4 degree is still viewed as the gold standard. If you want to move to Toronto or the states after graduating, go to uvic. Even if you have doubts about staying in Vancouver, go to uvic.",

            "comment": "If you are fresh out of high school and under no time or financial crunch, I would honestly say UVIC.\n\nUVIC has coop for their CS program as well and you have much more room to breathe in terms of personal projects and studying for interviews. Having the campus life is an important experience as well. BCIT has a heavy and overloaded course load, you won\u2019t have much time for social activities if you\u2019re trying to stay competitive for co-op (think 90%+ average).\n\nThe tech industry is also not doing too well right now. There\u2019s a possibility that if you take CST\u2019s shorter time period path, you might still get caught in the recession when looking for co-op or new grad jobs. This can make the job hunt significantly more challenging. \n\nHowever, if you want a cheap degree with a fast pipeline to a programming job, BCIT will be a good option if you\u2019re willing to work really hard for two years.",

Victoria is really just a ferry ride away so its nothing crazy far. Victoria is a nice place to live but its a real bitch to find rentals, unless u manage to get on-campus housing, which im not sure how much there is currently cuz they usually only have enough for 1st years, but ik theyre building more. im sure the uvic subreddit will offer you lots of useful information too",

I know you're eager to be independent but you have your whole life ahead of you. You will have way more opportunities in Vancouver opposed to Victoria.",

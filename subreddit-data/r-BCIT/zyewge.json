    "postText": "A bit of background about me: \nI graduated from SFU this year with a BSc in comp sci and didn't do coop, so I'm having a tough time finding my first career-related job due to the lack of professional experience. \n\nI've been looking into these two programs and thought that I can get some more hands on experience from BCIT, but not sure how they compare. I do know that CIT revolves around IT/DevOps/software vs Web dev (obvious from its name). CIT being a 2 year diploma and FEWD being a 1 year certificate.\n\nI would say that I have some experience in both SWE and web dev (from my prev courses) but not enough to make a firm decision between the two for the long run. I am open to learning something different (eg. IT) as well. \n\nI'm feeling pretty uncertain of what to do, so I wanted to ask around for some input/opinions regarding these programs and maybe even similar experiences from other people. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Some people who went to BCIT that didn\u2019t do co op also struggled.  It\u2019s normal to apply a lot before you get an interview. It\u2019s also important to do leetcode or projects to ensure you pass the interviews you do get quicker. I think doing those two first and keep applying will be the better option first. You can maybe apply if you want for next fall in one of these programs as a backup plan",

            "comment": "FEDW is limited in career path as you may only be a Front-end web developer, while CIT is more open and not just DevOps or System Administrator. There's people in CIT who get co-op and get Software Developer roles. Given that you already have a computer science degree. CIT or CST is a better option.\n\nThen it will just depend on if you can get a high enough GPA to get the co-op opportunity because only the top 20 students who apply can get into co-op.\n\nI recently got into co-op and my cGPA was 86%, which is okay as it's on the lower end.\n\nIf you're really fixed on doing another diploma or perhaps not complete the diploma and just use it to get into co-op to gain experience then move on.\n\nOther suggestions would be:\n\n\\- update your resume? chicago format?\n\n\\- focus on the cover letters which curates to the role?\n\n\\- any friends who may have opportunities open for you?\n\nI was kind of all over the place with my insight but hope it helps! :)",

Otherwise, you might have a bigger career effect if you did a Masters program.  That would be a more logical progression to employers.\n\nYou can always try temp companies.  \n\nI agree with someone here that suggested doing leetcode or projects.  Try github.  Or websites like HackerRank.",

It helped me with getting web dev side-gigs. I'm upgrading by taking Full-Stack Web Development with React Specialization at Coursera for cheap and part-time [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-react#courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-react#courses). You could do this instead of FEDW and then possibly take CIT at the same time?",

I know master program has internship as well if you want to take it. \n\nDid you get any interviews from any companies? If yes and you did not get in, you can skip the edit resume and jump to the next suggestion bellow. If you did not get any interviews, probably your resume has some problems.\n\n1. As many people suggested, I think what you should focus on is your Resume, Cover letter and your own projects. These things are the most important that decide you can have the interviews or not. Apply a lot and get call from a few companies is normal.\n\n2. After getting the interviews, practicing coding problems and behavior questions are what you should prepare. \n\nCIT will have the coop term in term 3. Many people choose CST because it will have coop in term 2, so it\u2019s faster if you still want to take a diploma program. Coop needs to find a job and interview as well, but it is easier than graduated students.",

            "comment": "FYI, the Front-end Web Developer program is not 1 year but about 6.5 months.\n\nYou could also look into the SSD program at BCIT if you are more interested in backend development instead of front-end. It is an 8 month program.\n\nThere is also the Full Stack program if you want to do both but it's a 2 year program.\n\nJob hunting is rough. I warn my students to be prepared to be doing it for months after finishing. Some will land something right away but it usually takes time for most looking in the junior front-end or ux jobs. Best of luck to you with whatever you choose!",

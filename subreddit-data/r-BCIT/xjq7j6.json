But you're going into the union more or less guaranteed if you pass. \n\nThere's not much in instrumentation in Vancouver. Go to oil fields or Alberta for that. \n\nPLC and controls is the future. Look into western integrated. They are controls electricians. There's a few automation companies too.",

Tbh trades aren't worth it. Once you factor in depreciating tools, your health, commute, ect it's not very profitable as an employee. You need to enter with the goal of eventually starting your own company to make a decent living. I wish I paid more attention in high school and got into engineering.",

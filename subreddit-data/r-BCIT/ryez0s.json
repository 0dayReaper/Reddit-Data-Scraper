Lots of us are in trades, engineering, or technical studies that require in person learning to get the most of our education. \n\nIf you feel your program will work better online, please speak to your program head. \n\nI understand the concern of omicron, but as vaccines are easily accessible and booster shots are pumping out, and masks are mandatory, several of us feel safe in an in class setting.",

Bonnie herself told employers to expect at least 1/3 of their employees being off sick. Why would that be any different for schools? If classes go back to in-person I can see a lot of students and instructors getting sick and classes having to be canceled or administered online anyways. It'll be a complete mess. It's much easier to just plan for online for the next few weeks while Omicron makes its way around.",

In my opinion, it just doesn't make sense. If workplaces are being impacted by the rapid spread of omicron, schools will too. I just foresee it getting really messy.",

I am want to be a mechanic who thats works in a brand shop such as Mercedes, Toyota &amp; Honda. I have a love for vehicles, but have never gotten ahead and asked where to research courses. I am quite lost here and would like some help for the general area I should be looking at. I am also wondering if this would a be smart idea since a lot of companies are switching from combustion to electric, that would mean that there would be less of a need for mechanics? I am full of questions.\ud83d\ude05",

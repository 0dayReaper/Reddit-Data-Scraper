One professor wants you to do things a certain way, and the next professor takes marks away for doing that same thing.\n\nWith a few exceptions, I've found the professors to be extremely unprofessional as well, literally dozens of spelling errors and contradictory information in assignments, quizzes, tests, lecture slides. \n\nIt's driving me a little crazy. I've gone to 3 different universities besides BCIT (3 other degrees...), and BCIT has so far been the worst in terms of professionalism.",

Adapting to different work styles and standards is a part of the learning process, and it can be a valuable skill to develop for future work experiences.",

But they don't actually introduce standards... they mark your assignments and you lose marks before they even tell you what to do. It's just arbitrary. The same thing you'd lose marks on for not doing in one class, you lose marks on for doing in another. It's not a helpful learning process, especially when the best practices way is the one that loses marks.",

If you're being docked marks for style when a style guide isn't given, it shouldn't be hard to bring it up and recoup whatever you've lost so far. In any case, approach the instructor, clarify the requirements, and adapt to them.\n\nI feel you on the professionalism part, but in my experience (3+ full-time terms of COMP) that's been the exception, not the rule. There have been maybe two or three instructors out of 15+ that I would call 'whack'. In those genuine cases, students complained and our program head(s) intervened swiftly.\n\nCurious: are you a professional student with 3 degrees or just bouncing between programs/schools?",

I've taken so many courses where I literally was like WTF. They were literally teaching incorrect information.   \n\n\nThere are some good teachers, but they're usually the ones teaching the advanced courses. They have a couple decades of real world experience and are teaching part time outside of their job (probably tryna afford a house in this god forsaken city haha), or near retirement, etc. The full/part time, professional teachers though... not so great in my experience. You can tell a shit teacher cause they refuse to have a conversation about what they're teaching. Its their way or the highway. Even when they're telling you a MAC stands for Machine Address Code and ARP is Auxiliary Resolution Protocol. Or that ephemeral ports are ports below 1023 like 25, 80, 110, etc. (Which is the exact opposite of what an ephemeral port is.) And this is all in one slide deck from one teacher. The rest of his slides were as bad/confusing. And he's not the only instructor ive had like this, though he was probably the worst of all of them.",

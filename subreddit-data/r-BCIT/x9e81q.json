    "postText": "Hey - I'm wondering if anyone here has completed Prior Learning Assessment &amp; Recognition for a class at BCIT?  What was your experience like and how did it go?\n\nI'm considering doing this for COMM 1103  - Introduction to Business and Technical Communication, possibly for ORGB 1105 - Organization Behaviour.  As a bit of background, I have 6 years working in business and currently working towards an Associate Certificate.  I'd like to cut down on the time it takes to complete the program (7 classes total), and I definitely see COMM 1103 being a lot of what I've learned through work and a business school diploma that I got in 2016..\n\nCurious to see how it went for others.\n\nThanks!",

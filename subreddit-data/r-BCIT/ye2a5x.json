    "postText": "Hi Reddit,\n\nLooking for people's experience on Jason Wilder as a prof. I see him teaching the part-time COMP 1516 class. I've tried to look him up on Rate My Prof but there isn't a lot of reviews. Does anyone have any experience taking his classes? I have no programming background so I am hoping to get a good instructor for my entry level classes. Mathew Linder has lots of great reviews online so I don't know if he would be a better option for COMP 1516.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

He does not give u trcik questions on any quizes or exams. His questions are straight out of his notes, just different numbers etc... He will tell u what types of questions will be on the exam during lectures. \n\nHis classes are not dry, in fact they're the only ones where everyone is dead focused, it's just his ability to grab our attention.\n\nHe will give u some very valuable pep talks here and there, he's gonna share his experience and how he was able to make the $ after CST",

It felt like we were basically learning to pattern match without a deeper understanding of the concepts. This was in a more quantitative course, so maybe it\u2019ll be different for Programming Fundamentals.\n\nHis life advice can also get overbearingly cliched and disrupt the flow of class. It\u2019s really easy for him to go off on unrelated tangents. I\u2019m sure it is helpful for some students, but it\u2019s not what I\u2019m taking the class for. Again, this is all my personal opinion.",

I am very picky person and I really like Mathew's class. He is very smart, patient, knowledgeable, easy-going, easy to reach via email. I have learned a lot from him. You would not regret taking his class. Hope my answer still helpful and good luck on the journey of programming!",

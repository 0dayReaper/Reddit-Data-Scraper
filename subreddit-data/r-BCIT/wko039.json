    "postText": "Hey guys \n\nI read some comment on the board that says the program mainly looks at English and Math Combine. I am a domestic applicant of CST 2023 winter, have a 92 on physics and geo, 86 pre-cal, 83 cal, 76 on chemistry and 71 Eng. Is there a chance of me being accepted. If not are there some other program recommended with lower admission average?",

The ABT program educates people towards construction management. BCIT started as a trade school and their \u2018architecture\u2019 program was an add-on, thus and misses the mark completely on the foundations of architectural education (fine arts, theory, history, etc). Their architecture group is extremely clicky as well, meaning if you dont suck up to some completely immature kids that are two years ahead you,you will not get in (they evaluate your portfolio,among other thingd). Best invest your time in a well ranked architecture\nprogram. The BCIT architecture program will only prepare you to be a draftsman at best.",

As an ABT graduate currently working this summer and will continue to the ArchSci program, I find that what they teach you is VERY applicable to the real world and has helped me tremendously with my job.\n\nABT touches on things relevant and essential to the industry like the BC building code, construction, specs, understanding other consultants, etc. \nUndergrad programs such as UBC is very theoretical and you may have a harder time adjusting to the workplace. \n\nThere are 3 electives you can take in your second year: Arch (what you\u2019ll likely pick), Building science (good if you want to look into sustainable buildings), and Econ (more so estimating, project management, etc)\n\nAs for theoretical knowledge, you\u2019ll get more into that if you take the Arch elective and continue to do ArchSci. ABT is more so getting the technical basics/foundation. \n\nNot sure what he meant by sucking up to the arch students 2 years ahead of you lol. But to continue to ArchSci, the program evaluates you on GPA and portfolio\n\nAs for M.Arch, I\u2019d hear of people continuing to schools like UBC or UofCalgary",

You have no idea of fine arts or architecture history, literally zero courses on that. Literally zero courses on fine arts, academical writing or academical research. Nothing to speak of on architectural themes and theory. Not a leg to stand on design fundamentals\u2026 no courses on that, its not your fault. Literally no idea of where you are standing in the payscale of things if you want to defend architecture grads with an education from ABT. Nothing wrong with that. But do get informed. Also\u2026 the portfolio to enter the ABT arch bachelors requires very low standards and zero technical proficiency in fine arts or craft, which is the foundation of modern (or postmodern) architecture. One more thing, while real architecture schools are based on a Bauhaus pedigree (lookup the Bauhaus education format) trade schools are based on local bylaws, constructibility methods and engineering practices. Nothing wrong with that, but its not architecture. You don\u2019t know where you are standing. To OP: please locate a real school",

Courses on graphics, media, design, history, and academic writing?\nSurely it\u2019s not from a prestigious university but it does provide good knowledge of what an architect actually does on a day to day basis here in BC (project managing as head consultant, integrative design, bidding, etc)\nIts focus isn\u2019t strictly theoretical, but it does have aspects of that in it. That being said, people shouldn\u2019t go there if that\u2019s all they want.",

We did have a graduation ceremony but it wasn't the ceremony for the semester we actually graduated in, it was the next semester's ceremony.\n\nSo if the ceremony is March 1-2, and you don't graduate until May, your ceremony wouldn't be until...like August or something when the next semester ends.",

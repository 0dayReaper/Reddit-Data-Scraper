I believe it was around $40 but I do not remember the exact amount. Does anyone have any clue? I\u2019m worried because it was stated it must be payed immediately.",

The balance owed should be on there.\n\nIf not, you can check the bcit website and look up specific tuition fees.\n\nIf there's no info, you can just call them to confirm the amount owed. No need to worry - they're here to help you.",

If it's not showing up, you can call Student Information &amp; Enrolment Services at 604-434-1610 or email Wendy Cheng at [peld@bcit.ca](mailto:peld@bcit.ca). You have two business days from the time of enrolment to send the payment through online banking.",

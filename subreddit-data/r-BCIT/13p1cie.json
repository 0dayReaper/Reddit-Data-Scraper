I want to apply BCIT Mining and Mineral engineering, but I don't know if the job prospect is good or not, any insight from mining graduates?  My second choice would be Electrical Engineering. \n\nAny suggestion for other engineering programs? Please give me some advice. Thank you reddits",

The demand for \"green\" materials is soaring, and even though capital is hard to come by projects are going ahead.\n\nTo be a successful mining engineer, you must be willing to travel, live and work in remote locations. If thats a dealbreaker then dont go into mining. \n\nIf you do choose to travel, financially its worth it, it will put you ahead of your peers who work in cities. i did it in my 20's with few attachments, so i was giving up little, making decent money and travelling.",

In other words, I'd like to work 14 days on site, and 14 days off back to Vancouver. I understand that mining industry is declining over the years, but number of students who study in mining program also dropped; so, is it easy to get a job upon my graduation. Once I get into the mining program, I will participate in extracurricular activities, such as becoming a peer tutor or getting involved in some projects, so they can help me upbuild my resume.",

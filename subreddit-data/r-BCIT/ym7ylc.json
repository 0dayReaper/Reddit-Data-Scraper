            "comment": "I would recommend to check out the course structure for both the programs and then see where you find yourself doing great. Since D3 and Graphic Design both focus on the Visual Design aspects, you can check out their specifications in terms of software and design techniques used. Another way to look at it would be to understand the industry you would like to work for and which course would benefit you more in your future employment.\n\nOther than that you can consider the duration, campus location, semester timings etc to help you make the decision.",

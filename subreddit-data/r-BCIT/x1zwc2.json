They have to register you as an apprentice and then they can send you off to school for about 7 weeks at a time (Machining has 4 Levels, so I assume it's similar for plumbing). Have a look here \n\nhttps://www.bcit.ca/programs/plumber-apprenticeship-full-time-4160appr/#courses\n\nIt's also worth to get in touch with BCIT, their student service is excellent and they are always super helpful and nice when it comes to any questions that you might have.",

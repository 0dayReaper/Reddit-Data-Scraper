It is possible to go straight from high-school but they usually want applicants to have some type of experience in the healthcare/medical field, or like with patient-care. Doing a post-secondary program would help and it just depends how long the program is. \nThere are shorter programs, for about a year or so, that give you certificates (like healthcare assistants, etc.), or longer diplomas/degrees, around 2-6 years depending on what it is. I've heard of people with lots of experience and degrees being accepted into the program; however, I have also heard of people with just a bit of experience in healthcare being accepted. Your application also plays a role when applying. \nI think the best thing would be to try and find a way to work/volunteer in a hospital, clinic, care home, or any place like that. It will be easier to build up more experience now since you're still young.\nOverall, don't stress because you have lots of time to figure things out. \nEnjoy your last few years in high-school and I hope the best for you!! :)",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve applied for student loans for the first time, however, it is taking a really long time to receive them. Has anyone paid their tuition out of pocket, and then was still able to receive their student loans? Does BCIT allow us to deposit it into our bank accounts, instead of using towards tuition? \nThank you!",

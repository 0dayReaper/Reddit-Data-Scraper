I'm planning to apply for AME category M for the May intake but they don't mention when the course are starting which worries me as I'm still finishing my last few months of school.\n\nThanks",

From the previous year's course [outlines](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/aircraft-maintenance-engineer-category-m-maintenance-diploma-full-time-1230dipma/#courses) it looks like the courses started May 9th.",

Also, you generally get a response to your application after 1-3 weeks.\n\nApplying to the AME diploma [doesn't show an exact start date](https://imgur.com/a/FzfSPi1) which is different compared to other programs at BCIT that show a start date when you apply. In this case you definitely want to contact [BCIT admissions](https://www.bcit.ca/admission/contact-us/) directly to find out ***when exactly*** you should apply if you want to start in the Aug/Sept intake. You might also be able to apply with your midterm grade 12 marks (also check with BCIT admissions on this).\n\nBasically ask BCIT admissions these questions and mention you are currently in grade 12:\n\n1. When should I apply for the Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Category 'M' (Maintenance) program if I want to in the August/September 2023 intake? When I try to apply online it doesn't show an exact start date so it is unclear if I apply now, is it for the May or August/September intake.\n2. Am I able to use my midterm grade 12 marks?\n\nYou should also know there's an information session online coming up specifically for your program and you can ask questions &amp; get more info. No harm in signing up and seeing what they have to say [Feb 23 5-7PM online](https://www.bcit.ca/event/aircraft-maintenance-engineer-category-m-amp-aircraft-maintenance-engineer-category-e-electronics-information-session-online/)",

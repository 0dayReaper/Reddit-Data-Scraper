My team and I are students in the D3 program and we are in the process of building an app that aims to help students better understand their tasks, assignments and readings. I'm sure we're all familiar with the 3-page long assignment rubric sheet \ud83d\ude14\n\nIf you are an individual who has trouble with reading, learning, and/or comprehension, we would love to have your input! Please send me a dm :-)",

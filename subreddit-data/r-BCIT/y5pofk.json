    "postText": "Hi guys! We built a Spotify add-on that takes a song and shortens it to the \"best\" 10-60 seconds to help you find your next favorite song, go through your discover weekly/release radar, and add to your playlists, faster.\n\nIt eventually learns what the \"best\" 10-60 second snippets are to you as you listen more. Uses genre/class/valence/song/weather/chorus/bridge and other factors.\n\nYou will also never be presented with the same song more than twice.\n\nWould love criticism/feedback, feature suggestions, thanks! :)\n\nApp Store link (for Spotify Premium + iPhone users): [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smores-music-discovery/id1626768775](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smores-music-discovery/id1626768775)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/34zf61qxz7u91.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d42a84fb09734256f28eac6b9c8fa487551e8989",

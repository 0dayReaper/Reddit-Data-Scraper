    "postText": "Hey everyone -- keeping this brief. A colleague of mine needs a short (\\~10 second) map animation showcasing a plotted route from one map point, to another, or ideally multiple points sprawling simultaneously from a single starting map point.\n\nAs a D3 grad from BCIT, I figured someone here might have sharper AE skills than me (and the time!). This clip would need to be completed prior to Tuesday, August 2nd.\n\nAny takers here? You'd be more than welcome to use the clip as part of your portfolio if you're a student, and you'd be compensated for you time and work (you'd need to discuss hourly rates with my colleague -- I'm not in a position to negotiate rates).\n\nInspiration/examples to pull from:\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O98DtKPYvow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O98DtKPYvow)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb643LMlyI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bb643LMlyI)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LzxpbZ489Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LzxpbZ489Y)\n\nAlso, I recognize there's lots of communities like UpWork or Fiverr where we could find talent, which we'll look into, but I always prefer to support local communities if I can (e.g students building portfolios, locals looking for extra cash, etc.).",

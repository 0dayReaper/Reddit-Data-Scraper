    "postText": "I'm looking for any opinions that people have regarding the following CST options being offered in Sep 2023:\n\n- Data Communication\n- Digital Processing\n- Information Systems\n- Client/Server\n- Programming Paradigms\n- Predictive Analytics\n\nSome things I (and probably others browsing) would like to know for a given option are how is the workload, how is the option head, are the skills you learn in that option useful/valuable etc.? Ultimately I know that any given option isn't really definitive for your career, but I'm just curious.",

            "comment": "I took Client/Server. Here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros: \n\n- The option head is Tejinder, very knowledgeable man, he's very chill and laid-back and will go to great length with every question you have. He's easy on deadlines as well, he extends the deadline if he sees people haven't completed assignments or need more lectures to get through things.\n\n- The option will cover socket programming, TCP, UDP protocol, HTTP, etc. for the whole term 3 and 2-3 first weeks of term 4. You'll use Java, C++, C# respectively to build a native server and native/web client. Multicasting is also covered in one assignment with game in Unity and C#. You'll be able to understand how communication works at low level. Once you get it, server/backend development becomes so easy, web dev is just a piece of cake.\n\n- The rest of the option will cover .NET Framework, ASP.NET MVC Framework/Core with Entity Framework. In this you'll learn more about building models and relationships between entities in ASP.NET, then you'll work your way through CRUD operations using those in controllers and views with Linq queries. I found this part is much easier compared to the first part of the option. \n\n- The option will also cover Linux and inter process communication like threads, fork, concurrency, etc. This will be helpful for the OS course in term 4.\n\n- Projects: 1 project in term 3 that you can pick from Tejinder's given topics (he'll provide you needed hardwares like raspberry pi, TI sensor, etc.), 1 personal project in term 4 that you can do whatever you want (with Tejinder's approval), 1 final class project where you build an ASP.NET Core web app.\n\n- The option will also cover OLTP, OLAP, PL/SQL, testing and sercurity.\n\n- Chance to get employed is high because you'll see most of the software dev job require a lot of things Tejinder teached (like C#, .NET, PL/SQL)\n\n- Exams are based off assignments so if you don't do the assignments, good luck with knowing where to start the exam and finish it in short time.\n\n- Before chatGPT, Tejinder gave coding exam with open book and googling. One exam was 24-hour long solving 3 questions, each has 4-5 small questions, he did this in order to let us test our answers and not half-guess. I really like this way because we can learn so many more things during the exam, but he doesn't give exam like this anymore, everything is closed-book and on paper now (2 pages of cheasheet are allowed).\n\n- Tejinder will post the code similarly to the exam's code ahead of time, you won't be able to know the questions and they are fairly difficult.\n\n\n\nCons: \n\n- This is not an easy option. A lot of self-study to work your way through assignments/projects. If you don't have a lot of experiences in programming or your programming skills are not strong, you'll struggle and need a large amount of time to self-study everything from basic again. I saw 3-4 people in my set couldn't get by assignments and got demotivated a lot through the terms. Tejinder's lectures (just him talking over his sample code in notepad, mostly no slides at all or rarely 2-3 slides) will not be enough for you to understand the concepts and assignments, you have to watch a lot of YT tutorial videos (I know a person in my set refused to do this and he suffered) and googling to get through this option.\n\n- Assignments are hard to find where to start. Many people feel lost even though Tejinder already gives sample code and lectures. I found it very hard as well but for people who already have many experiences in my set, they don't find assignments are that difficult. A person in my set decided not to continue with client/server and switch to another option because of this reason.\n\n- Tejinder will help you, but you have to ask him a lot of questions until he gets your problem and gives you the answer you want. Most of the time he would answer sth else (still in the scope of the assignment/project).\n\n- Tejinder uses notepad to go over code, lectures are dry (and sleepy sometimes).\n\n- A lot of software and code versions (especially .NET) that Tejinder was using in my terms were outdated. We have to find our own ways to make things work. This is much harder than you think because his assignments are difficult and usually his sample code will help, if you can't run or can't have his code work in your computer, you'll spend more time finding ways to do it by yourself.\n\n- Mac users: be aware of this option because most of the things will be (only) available and easy to work with on Windows and Microsoft softwares (especially Visual Studio, SSMS). I saw people who have Mac in my class either they have to find another way to do things, or just get a Windows laptop to work through 3 courses of this option. \n\n- Pick a good team to work with, or you'll have to carry the team (or let ppl carry you) and your life will be much more miserable.",

            "comment": "I took Predictive Analytics and here\u2019s my opinion on it: \n\n**Option head**: Pat is generally a very understanding guy. Doesn\u2019t care about in person vs online attendance.\n\n**Workload**: term 3 wasn\u2019t too bad at all, I found it very manageable. Term 4 was quite a lot of work and was probably one of the heaviest course(s) in terms of amount of work but it\u2019s not super difficult.\n\n**How it works**: every week there is a lesson and lab where Pat goes through over the Word document for the class. Each doc has examples and then exercises for you to do. You can get a bunch of them done during the class or you can work on something else since Pat records all of the classes. There will also be 2 or 3 large assignments that you generally have a lot of time for and just elaborate and combine techniques learned.",

I'm wondering if I should take an option that focuses more on skills that I'm likely to use in industry. My previous degree is in biology so I'm wary of studying something again that is interesting, but doesn't have great employability. Although I know that the options don't really do anything to define your career.",

You get to learn how to use Tableau and Power BI as data visualizers for dashboards or reports. \n\nThey teach you the basics on data models and data structures. How to improve data quality for datasets of any size.\n\nMy friend from SFU's Big Data program said some of the SSRS classes are a bit outdated since nowadays these tools are not used that much... (his opinion could be biased lol) but beyond that it's still pretty relevant. There's a class on Crystal Reports which is also kind of outdated since it's kind of dying out. They've added classes on Power BI and hopefully more for Tableau as these tools are more common in the data analytics field. \n\nI also enjoyed the Python courses.",

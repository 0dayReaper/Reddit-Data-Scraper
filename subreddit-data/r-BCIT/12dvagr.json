I would also really appreciate if any of you provided a book or a plan that could cover most of what I should expect in the first year when the course starts. \n\nI genuinely want an average above 85%-90% for CO-OP so any feedback would be appreciated. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgsflf5ogbsa1.png?width=2382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=869f647a187d7a39f2394b1a8130b43b2e4cc938",

It looks a little bit too broad imo.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t programmed before, I would say focus on learning Python syntax (including OOP, some tutorials doesn\u2019t include this topic) as well as the holy trinity of webdev (HTML/JS/CSS). Being comfortable with the syntax is a plus.",

I've studied a somewhat decent amount of Python (Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes for those who are curious) and I know enough in CSS and HTML to make basic websites, still need to start JavaScript though. \n\nTo be fully honest, I'm mainly worried about the more theoretical CS side of things in the list that I'm not familiar with.",

Learn to properly address issues and be courteous.\n2) Always use the word \"HELP\" but don't abuse it, people tend to lend a hand to help.\n3) have a good relationship with your set. They are not your enemy.\n4) Use Peer Tutoring if you must. Don't be shy to use any means you can if you have a goal\n5) Always ask questions, make clarification early in the class.\n\nYou cannot honestly be ready enough. What you learn is sometimes what you won't be tackling. The best preparation you can do is really prepare yourself mentally for the stress you will experience while studying.",

You will actually cover a lot more than just OOP and things you learned in python will carry over to js and java. Programming languages usually implement similar concepts so getting familiar with one language goes a long way. Good luck in your studies \ud83d\udc4d",

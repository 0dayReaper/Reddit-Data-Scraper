    "postText": "Hi there, I am so excited that I finally got an interview. I was wondering if people can give me some insights on what to expect. I did some research but I just want to ask if people can give me more information as it is gonna be in a zoo meeting. I am so excited and I was not really expecting to get in so I was thrilled. Thank you.",

When describing the pictures make sure to be specific and say only what you see in the pictures, not what you assume could be the characteristics of the objects in the pictures.",

If you are super detail oriented itll be fine. Not sure if they will add something in to judge character cuz it was so easy when I did it but I'm pretty sure they use Casper to weed people out instead. You shouldn't expect this MMI to be like ubc pharm is all I gotta say lol",

            "comment": "I did the MMI a couple of years ago and in person so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nYou will get one on one time with multiple teachers in the med lab program where they will ask you questions relating to your past experiences in dealing with other people, hypothetical situations regarding your peers and potential future employment, as well as some questions to test your interest in science.  In addition, there was also a station to test your ability to see colour and to see if you can follow instructions properly (although I have no idea how they would be doing that online).  From what I remember, it was quite easy and as long as you're not a borderline psychopath you should be good to go.  They're really just looking to see if you have basic maturity and empathy that most people should have.  As long as you answer properly and confidently and show interest in the program, you are likely to make it.  Good luck!",

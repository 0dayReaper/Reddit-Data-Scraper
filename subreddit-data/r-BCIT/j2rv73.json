    "postText": "I'm in 3rd term CST.  \n\n\nEach term, we have at least two courses that could be useful if the teacher wasn't either a complete moron or awful at communicating.  \n\n\nThis term, 3/6 teachers are completely unqualified to do their jobs. I don't care if you have industry experience; that doesn't make you a competent teacher.  \n\n\nGood teaching requires good communication. Communication is built on three things:  \n\\- body language  \n\\- intonation  \n\\- words  \nGiven that everything is online, we only have intonation and words. So the fact that you're fucking monotone means that nothing you say is clear or stands out in my mind as important.  \n\n\nHow can so many people be technology profs and not understand that you need a good quality microphone? Some of these teachers mumble, some of them scream into the microphone.  \n\n\nOne of them gets confused constantly in the middle of lecture and goes off track, making it very difficult to follow what's going on. How are you this confused by your own technology?  \n\n\nOne of them literally copy and pastes code into an IDE and then reads it out loud as if that counts as a useful explanation of a new concept.  \n\n\nAnother one takes slides directly from the textbook manufacturer and reads straight off them. These slides are full of mathematical formulas that are written incorrectly and contrary to EVERYTHING we have ever learned about how to format your answers in math. The teacher literally reads the formula OUT LOUD in lieu of a proper explanation. Seriously, do you think I can't read?  \n\n\nYou are bad at your job. BCIT shouldn't allow you to teach people a PAID course. And most importantly, you're harming the future work force by being completely useless.",

If you want, email your program head - I've done that before and there were changes implemented pretty quickly after I complained. If you do that, just make sure you do it in a professional manner. \n\nDo your best to get through the program despite a few poor classes/teachers - you're almost finished!",

I don't remember if BCIT had mid-term instructor reviews, but if they still do, definitely note your concerns there. \n\nNo institution is going to have a perfect cast of instructors, and in my opinion, BCIT already has some of the best. The online teaching format is probably putting the instructors' existing flaws underneath a larger microscope. I remember most of my instructors being very open to feedback, and this might be difficult to understand now given the absence of body language, tones, and environment.\n\nI feel for you though. I would be livid if I had to pay $3k+ for a subpar education with inexperienced instructors.",

Sure, these instructors have industry experience and might even be very respected in industry, but their understanding of pedagogy is absolute shit.\n\nI think the solution should be to have every potential instructor do a lecture for people from other departments and then have those people rate their understanding of the concept that was lectured on. If they don't convey understanding, they don't get hired.",

After all, they are paying for the education. \n\nIf consumer bought a defective product, would they be happy?  What is different in this situation? Students are paying to be taught. \n\nSadly bringing up the issues with the program and admin wont do much. I'm pretty sure they have had ample time with the past 20 years to review all the negative surveys that instructors in CST have had. I've had seniors who graduated from CST 8-10 years ago who also had those infamously bad instructors, but yet here people are in 2020 still having those same issues. Obviously those feedbacks left from previous students who graduated don't do much, thus resulting many of the students to be discourage to even bother with the surveys.\n\nIf you look BCIT's own CST online survey under the graduation jobs tab, you can see the quality of instructors is rated roughly around 60%? You have students taking loans out just to take the program and not to mention international students who pay 10k+ plus per semester, settling for a 60% satisfaction rate? This doesn't even include the people who didn't want to bother with the survey's responses. \n\nThe problem is with the education system, probably not just with BCIT as well. I can only speak on my past experience with BCIT since that's where I graduated. Sadly a person's education or experience is much more valuable to the school than a person who can actually teach. But then again, maybe BCIT just doesn't have the budget to hire someone of that caliber.\n\nEducation should NOT be somewhere where students are forced to self learn. Students are exactly in school to be taught. Self learning is what people do outside of school. A sad reality that most schools and people have already long forgotten.\n\nNorth American laws give a lot of protection to workers which include instructors, therefore I'm guess they cant really just be fired for \"poor teaching skills\". Something very different in Asia where yes, you can be fired for being inadequate at your job. This should especially apply for instructors as they directly effect the learning experience for our future generations.",

There are some very good profs, and some very bad ones, problem is the very good ones don't hang around.  \n\n**EDIT: Well some stay, some even post here, so want to be clear that it isn't all bad.**\n\nYou can be very good at development, or very good at teaching, or both.  If it's both you have very good earning potential in industry so why teach.\n\nI'm almost finished PT CSC and have started CST, so I guess 1/3 though.  Some remarks:\n\n**Too much time on introductory topics**\n\nHonestly I don't think CST needs to be four years.  If I learned a For loop in java I don't need the same instruction in C/C++/C#/Python/et all.  \n\nIf you took your intro in Java or Python, and have moved on to C#, they should show you were to find documents for things like syntax and then move on to what makes that language unique like .Net or unique features to C#.  We should be learning how to learn, not fed it with a spoon bit by bit.  If you need somebody to teach you fundamentals for each language you aren't going to last very long on the industry.\n\n**Where are the advanced topics?**\n\nDo I need to get to fourth year to get into design patterns or clean architecture from Uncle Bob?  What about data structures?\n\n**Where is version control?**\n\nI work in the industry, and this is huge, where the hell is it?  Having decent version control is more important than having good software, because without it everything just turns into a mess anyway.  I'm on my 3rd architecture/Agile/Scrum class but nowhere in the program have we even mentioned GIT.  Or Jira or Synergy or...\n\nI think the curriculum needs a reboot to challenge the profs.",

You're harming the workforce by being a big whiner who complains about bad instructors and yet have no self discipline skills. Take a look in the mirror buddy. You're not that great.",

Some people had great teachers in high school, and some people did not. This is especially the case in post-secondary and, even if you switch schools/programs, you'll still end up with a subpar instructor.\n\nI would take this as an opportunity to develop skills for the real world. When you start working somewhere new, you'll be tasked to learn new processes, even new languages and there's no guarantee that you will be provided with a great instructor or mentor to teach you the company's processes and library. Most likely, you'll be dumped with a bunch of documentation or outdated video tutorials that you'll have to sit through. Basically, you'll be forced to learn things by yourself. Might as well learn this skill in college where your reputation isn't on the line yet than wait for when passing your probation is on the line.",

The fact that that is common doesn't mean anyone needs to accept it.  \n\n\nThis also isn't an issue of teaching yourself skills for the \"real world.\" In the real world,  if you are incompetent at your job, you don't get very far. You will get fired, lose customers, or receive a lot of complaints. Why aren't students allowed to have expectations of quality for their teachers? It's not like we're not paying for this. This isn't anyone being a choosing beggar.  \n\n\nOften, people say \"you're just here for the paper\" when someone complains about bad teachers and having to teach themselves. That may be true especially when bad teachers are expected and the norm. However, this argument implies that the only benefit of post-secondary is getting a diploma, and that is simply not true. People attend post-secondary to get a sense of direction, learn from experts, and ask questions directly. People don't pay solely for the paper, they want the experience. Why else do you think every single institution boasts that they have the \"best instructors?\"",

    "postText": "Hi, everyone\u2026 I\u2019m planning to apply into the ABT part time program and then apply to the diploma one since most are saying it\u2019s better to take some courses to get the best chance of acceptance and also it\u2019ll be hard to get a job with only a certificate. I just have a few questions to those who graduated from it or knows anything about it\u2026\n\n- Which classes did you take on the certificate program? How was your experience? \n- How many classes did you take from the certificate program before applying to the diploma one? \n- What was your average grade?\n- Are your grades from certificate program classes enough to get you in the diploma program? Or is it going to boost you grades?\n\nI\u2019m sorry if I have so many questions (it\u2019s also my first time using Reddit)\u2026 I really want to get answers first before applying to the program since there\u2019s a $90 for applying and I don\u2019t know if my grades would be enough for the diploma program. I hope you can help me answer my questions. Thank you all so much in advance!",

As for what classes to take, I recommend taking drafting, bc building code, Autocad, and maybe even revit if you can. I usually only took 3-4 classes per semester since I was working (classes were during the night) my grades were okay, but having previous trades experience really helps to get into the diploma program. I wish I knew that at the time\u2026 I was told after I finished my certificate that I would of gotten in easily because I had completed level 1 plumbing.",

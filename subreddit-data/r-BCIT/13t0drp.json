However, as someone who has moved around various rentals over the years, I can say for a fact that if you're looking for good rentals online, they are never impossible to find! You just have to keep checking in everyday! Bookmark all those rental pages and check back once or twice a day! The good deals/locations get scooped up within HOURS!  \n\n\nGood luck!!",

I am from the united states and I am really wanting to attend a program at BCIT, I was wondering, are international students able to use some sort of loans whether its private bank loans, etc.? I don't really have enough money to just outright pay for tuition so I'm just curious on what my options are, thank you!",

International fees would honestly probably be about the same as a US school's local tuition. \n\nI would contact the financial aid office for information on whether or not they provide student loans to international students. OP may have to apply for a loan via the US.",

I have a hard time believing a community college in the US is more expensive than international tuition at BCIT, especially if you factor in the cost of living here.",

BCIT has some amazing programs and i work with several BCIT graduates who are making well into the 6 figures. Many of BCIT's programs are on par or even better than those you would find at a university.",

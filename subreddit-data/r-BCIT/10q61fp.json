I would recommend only spending that $500 if there is an affirmative reason to attend BCIT and not just as a backup plan. BCIT is incredibly tough - for many programs - if you don't really want to succeed in your program for its own sake, it's unlikely to be a good experience",

Also a lot of employers value BCIT diplomas over other University degrees because they know how hands on BCIT is and how they actually give you experience in the field youre tryna go into.\n\nOnly thing is you have to be very focused and determined when going to BCIT as it\u2019s fast paced and a lot of assignments. If you think thats not for you and you want something more flexible choose SFU.",

Everything was just automatic when I set the term and my program (CIT).  \n\n\nSo yeah, maybe just notification of assessment at best? For the email. But yeah, the end date was whatever the last day of the 5 week term and preset. Is there nothing that explicitly say you will get \"x\" funds distributed on a date around April or May?",

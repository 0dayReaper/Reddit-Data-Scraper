On the sheet it asked if you were doing a rewrite and the invigilator gave the notion of something along the lines like \"Yea if you fail there is 2 rewrites per term\" so the test isn't exactly a walk in the park. But generally if you study you should get a passing grade by doing practice tests online from random websites and watching YouTube videos. (:",

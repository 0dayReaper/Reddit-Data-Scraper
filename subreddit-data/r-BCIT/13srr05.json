    "postText": "Hey all, I know CST is high workload and skipping class is not recommended, but I have an important life event which may take place either first week of classes in term 1, or some time later in winter/spring of 2024. This will make me miss class for sure, so I'm trying to weigh my options here, whether it's better to do it in first week of term 1 when things are slower and there will be no exams, or to do it next year. If i get into coop, does it start Jan 2024 until the end of the term? I'm in Fall 2023 intake.",

Week 1 Term 1 is probably the least terrible time to skip. Make sure you let the program head know though. They might recommend you try for Winter intake instead though.\n2. Co-op happens between Terms 2 and 3 I believe. So I think it should be Summer 2024 + Fall 2024. (Note that Co-op delays graduation by 6 months)",

They can help you and allow you to submit labs or do the quizzes later, but It depends on how important the event is. Ask your classmates to share notes or videos to make sure you don\u2019t miss anything during that week. Set A will studying online in their first term. My friend got Covid and skipped 1.5 weeks, but still did really well.",

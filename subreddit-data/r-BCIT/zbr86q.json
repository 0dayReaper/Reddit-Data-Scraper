If you want dev ops and stuff do the AWS certificates.  If you want to do system admin do Linux and Windows certificates. \n\nBut most important of all is grow your professional network, attend events, prepare your resume, interview skills, public speaking, etc.",

The CIT program itself will not automatically guarantee you high TC.  It's just the first step and you will need to focus on your goal and keep working.  \n\nI should stress coop is really important as it removes a lot of the luck factor.",

    "postText": "I will be starting COMP 1516 in May in the downtown campus, and the description says \"in a lab with PCs provided\" but I am wondering if anyone who has taken this course before has any input on whether having your own laptop is better/recommended? I have a gaming desktop at home so I would rather avoid buying a laptop just for class if possible.",

It\u2019s not just BCIT grads. \n\nI believe that the job hunting environment is vastly different for entry level jobs vs mid-senior level jobs. \n\nI also believe/hypothesize that entry level jobs would be most affected by the current market conditions. People with experience are willing to do more entry level positions, and companies aren\u2019t willing to hire entry level person for an entry level job. There are always shifts in job titles that are \u201chot\u201d in the market for recruiters to snag talents. E.g. cloud engineer, platform engineer, etc, but you\u2019d be doing tasks that aren\u2019t technically aligned with the day to day of the buzzword positions.\n\nI don\u2019t think that we are in a similar economic conditions as in 2008 however. The US economy isn\u2019t susceptible to the credit crunch, because banks haven\u2019t been doing subprime lending. Canadian banks are mostly in good solvency positions too. US GDP is in a good trajectory, and the dollar remains relatively strong. Based on this, I don\u2019t think the job market will stay in the decline. However, we will hit a market crash soon. Contrarian arguments could\u2019ve been made that everything is priced in a lot quicker due to faster access to information, but the unemployment statistics do not lie (and less volatile). https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS13026638 Permanent job losses indicate concern in the market by companies. Realistically, everyone should brace for bad job market for about a year or more, as the revenues won\u2019t recover overnight.\n\nI believe the recruiting environment is seasonal, aka there are months where one would apply and not many responses will be returned. Refining your LinkedIn profile is good and all, but at times like these I\u2019d recommend joining meetups where you can demonstrate your technical skills and network hard. Also don\u2019t wait for a job you like. I\u2019d recommend just getting any job, because you\u2019d be lucky to get hired in this market.",

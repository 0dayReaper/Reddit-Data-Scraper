    "postText": "I've heard mixed things about the job prospects of the power and process engineering program at BCIT.  Some people say you almost have to know someone in order to get your foot in the door.  I have a friend to did the program and now works at Suncor, but he knew the hiring manager.  I've heard others say that it's not too hard to find a job after, especially if you are willing to relocate.\n\nIs the field oversaturated at the entry level?  Tough to get a job without knowing someone?",

But that\u2019s me personally. If you\u2019re okay with the idea of that then you should be fine. I\u2019d expect there\u2019s lots of opportunities available in alberta for example or northern BC",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am a brand new BCIT student and I will be starting my journey in the Industrial Instrumentation Diploma program in just a couple of weeks. I am making this post wondering if there is any anecdotal advice someone can give me that you wish you would have known when you were starting out either in this program or BCIT in general. I am in my mid 20s so it has been a few years since I was in an academic setting and I will take any advice I can get. Thanks and God bless!",

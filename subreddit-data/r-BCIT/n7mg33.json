    "postText": "# Term1 review of CST. \n\nHello. You might be interested in signing up for two years of abuse. In short, the program overall is 'okay' with many asterisks. \n\nTerm 1 will be incredibly competitive to get into the top 50 students. This will allow you to join the co-op program. Finding co-op working is valuable to your career so it is very important.  \n\nIs this worth *your* time? Probably not.    \n\n*****\n\n## Here's the general demographic:  \n###(Group 1 people who are all-in):   \n*   adults looking for a career change  \n*   people who already have degrees  \n*   people leaving their job  \n*   International students who need to do well to gain perm residency and a significantly better quality of life and income   \n*   People who are skilled at programming and passionate about it. Don't mistake previously taking a couple of courses in programming as skilled.    \n\n###(Group 2, odds are against you):  \n* fresh high school students   \n* people who have little to no programming experience     \n\n  \nIf you're in group 2, you're better off not going with this program. It's emotionally taxing and extraordinarily stressful. Look into transfer programs to university. Like Douglas -&gt;&gt; UBC/ SFU.   \n\nI really have to emphasize this point, if you're in group 2, you don't have the same level of resilience and motivation as group 1 to do well... or to even pass. Many group 1 people think of CST as a 'last chance in their life to get a decent source of income.     \n\n*****\n\n## How to have better odds in getting into the top 50 for co-op:  \n- Select your teams wisely. Scramble and reach out to people who you feel have a good work ethic. Namely, that they have group 1 traits.   \n- Get enough sleep, don't do all-nighters  \n- Get to know your peers well  \n- Learn to learn, never read the textbook. Do practice problems but don't read them (unless java 1510).    \n- Choose your campus wisely. DTC if you're a new coder. BBY if you're skilled. BCIT flip flops on allocating co-op seats for BBY/DTC. You have a high probability of getting a high GPA if you're in DTC, opposite if you're in BBY. This semester, they reserved a fixed number of seats for BBY. In the past, DTC which had 50/150 CST students took most of the seats.    \n- try not to work. Assignments take a lot of time. It's not uncommon for me to have spent 15+ hours on just 1 weekly web dev assignment.    \n- Follow instructions very closely to get every point you can    \n- surround yourself with people as motivated as you. Keep reinforcing why you go through this pain. Understand why its worth it to you.    \n- use some sort of effective time management technique   \n\n*****\n\n## Tier list of instructors:  \nS: Simin, Maryam, Chris Thompson   \nA+: Carly   \nA:  \nA-: Aaron* (arguable definitely)   \nB+: Charles   \nB:  \nC:   \nD: Bruce  \nF: Keith",

I\u2019m now working in the industry with a very amazing company, making a very good income and enjoy going to work everyday. \n\nThe thing this post is missing IMO is that your actually passion or love for this type of career trumps all this. Additionally how you work with a team and how solid your interpersonal skills are, totally outweighs your ability to solve some leet code questions faster than the last guy. \n\nJust take this post with a grain of salt and follow your gut. It\u2019s a hard program but it\u2019s super rewarding, and you\u2019ll meet life long friends in it.",

I'm also in group 2 and didn't get into the co-op program. I'm also working in the industry with an awesome company. That's not to say that the people from group 1 didn't have an advantage or Co-op is irrelevant. Co-op does give you a massive advantage and being in group 1 does give you an advantage as well. However hard work and dedication as well as the right personality does go a long way and plays a big role in your success//finding a job.",

You get assigned to the downtown or Burnaby campus, and within those campuses, you are assigned a cohort  or \u201cset\u201d or 25 people.  They will be your classmates for two years, then some go off to coop and others go right into term 3 options.  The final two years will have you in a new set with other people in the same option as you.\n\nThe sets in each campus share most of their class times, so you\u2019ll still interact a lot with other sets.\n\nYou can switch campuses and switch sets by emailing the program head.  However, once you\u2019re put into an option, switching is tricky.  Not all options are offered every semester, and if you abandon your option for another one, you\u2019ll have to stay an extra semester to take the new option courses.",

In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter that much, because you\u2019ll be self-teaching yourself a lot anyways, and you\u2019ll get the basic fundamentals you need no matter what.",

I regret not using an ahegao background just to spite her.\n* Shachi posted a lecture video of her reading off the textbook. When a student confronted her about it, she dirty deleted the video off D2L.\n* Shachi failed to understand how bonus marks work. Only those who did the bonus questions got 100%. The rest got 95%.\n* Shachi deleted her Discord server's general chat after another student asked her for feedback on the assignments and labs. \n* Shachi also bumped up that student's mark to 100% without giving him the feedback specifically.\n* Shachi had the AD observing her Zoom lecture once. She didn't bother to cover up her unprofessionalism in front of him. Even when the students were calling her out. I can assume that the AD was secretly cringing from what was going on. And I had plans to skip the lecture to do something else but I stayed for the watch party on Discord.",

I taught myself a lot of programming before starting the program and it added very little.  If you have no background in software development, it will be difficult at first but should get progressively easier.

Some of the concepts are pretty abstract like Comp Architecture or Signal Attenuation in data comms, this is where the bulk of the traditional studying and hours of practice lies.

BCIT programs will put you thru the ringer but if you're proactive work hard network well with students, instructors, deans, you can succeed. However you're personal life will take a hit, personally for me things worked out so If i were you i would consider all the options and then make a decision. The quality of learning is good although brutal, so would I recommend it yes but be very cautious",

            "comment": "Thanks for the information. Just finished Term 3 and would go to Term 4 this year on dt campus. I think term 2 is more important than term 1.\n\nTerm 1 just determine if you have the ability to get the co-op, but Term 2 would determine if you could go to Term 3 and choose your future option course.\n\nI know some guys can not go to Term 3 cuz they failed some courses in Term 2 (September Course), had no time to take the equivalent part-time course and go to Term 3 (January Course), and need to wait for a year.\n\nBe careful to choose your option after term 2, the evaluation of option course and option instructor is really important. If you are interested in an option, go to ask a guy currently in term 3 or term 4 about the evaluation of this option. And Please Don't Regret your option and change to another option unless you have a lot of time to waste.",

Luckily there are a lot of resources for web dev so getting through his course is doable as long as you stay ahead of assignments. definitely take the above instructor tier list with a grain of salt. everything else is accurate from my experience",

    "postText": "Hey all!  I am planning to apply to the program for 2024 but still weighing between Jan or Sept intake. So here are a few questions:\n\n1. What are the pros and cons of both intakes?  Is it easier to get a co-op with a sept intake, considering the co-op term starts in May for the sept intake?\n\n2. Going through the Program matrix, I am confused about Level 1B and 2B as they are 'optional to those who complete one term of co-op' , although co-op is only available after completing the level 2. Am I missing something here?\n\n3. Are all speciality options available to both intakes of the second year? Any advice on the speciality options?\n\nI would really appreciate insights of current students and recent grads of the program. I do understand that the program has Navy Seal- level workload but one has to to brave through it all to escape the grind of working two minimum - wage jobs.  Please do not keep your experienced insights and recommendations to yourselves :(",

            "comment": "In my opinion, I think January (Winter) intake is easier for co-op:\n\n- Unless you\u2019re confident with your skills, you may want to use the summer to prepare for the job search.\n- You will have your mini term / project term before your job search. This is an instant +1 project on your resume. Make the most out of it.\n- Summer internships are more competitive bc of uni students, but you don\u2019t have to worry about it because BCIT has some pretty good connections. As long as you have a good resume, you\u2019ll get an interview.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re planning on applying to the CST program, I recommend just going for it! IMO the intakes don\u2019t differ that much, so the sooner you start/graduate, the sooner you can get started on your job after graduation. What really matters is your time management and your ability to learn. \n\n1. Starting in September means that your coop job search will be during the new year, which is a great time to be applying for jobs because hiring managers will have received new hiring budgets, and people are back at their jobs again after the winter holidays. The downside is that you\u2019ll only have 2-3 weeks to prepare your resume/CV and prepare for interviews. In addition, your preparation will be during the holidays, so it might be tough staying focused when your family/friends are celebrating. January intake students have the whole summer, but again, this will depend on how disciplined you are. \n\n2. I believe that coop terms can be used for credits, which is why those courses are optional; if you manage to secure a coop placement, your work replaces those project courses. \n\n3. No, not all options are available throughout the year. You will have to email the CST program head to get the exact list. I recommend choosing an option that interests you and has a good instructor. I personally chose Web and Mobile because I\u2019m really interested in full-stack development.",

The only concern I have is the slight differences in the content as well as the chapter questions between the one they want you to buy and the pdf you have. If that isn't a big deal just use the pdf version and save some money. To me the whole thing about $200 newest edition textbooks with very slight variations is a scam",

A lot of BCIT instructors say you need to purchase the textbook they are using but often times I didn't. (I'm was in a different program so I can't speak for ECET)",

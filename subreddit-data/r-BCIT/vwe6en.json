    "postText": "I have applied for New Media Design and Web Development Course for the May 2023 intake and have been put on the waitlist (under top 5) for the same. \n\n\\- Based on the given information, I should be hearing back from the College if any seat becomes available when someone doesn't pay the commitment fee two weeks after the acceptance.  \nI got my result on 22nd June and since then I haven't heard further from the college.\n\n\\- The other situation highlights that I'll be informed 60 days before the program starts and also that Admission can even maintain the waitlist until the end of the first week of classes!  \n\n\n**So my question is for those applicants who got into BCIT after they were placed on waitlist-**   \n\u2022 How much time did it take BCIT to provide you with the seat availability information from the first result date?  \n\u2022 Should I send an enquiry email for the seats availability or writing a Letter of Interest to the Admission Office for my continued interest would be a better option?\n\nI am really hoping to get into May 2023 Batch but the uncertainty is a bit unsettling. I would really appreciate any guidance or information on the same.\n\nThanks  \nxoxo  \n\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.bcit.ca\\/admission\\/after-you-apply\\/application-status\\/waitlisted-application\\/](https://preview.redd.it/rbsjq7x7mwa91.png?width=1031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=436ae9ce1a92e4a0ee7c1799401788c835f5e161)",

And the fact that it is a first qualified first admitted sort of admissions and you got waitlisted even when you applied on the first day, that's just insane. Do you remember the time you applied, how long after admissions opening? I'm applying for the 2024 intake and kinda freaked out. Thanks",

But then I researched a lot and also interacted with the college- and got to know that the course that we are applying to is highly competitive and in-demand.\nSo the best time is to apply within the hour the applications open. But since I applied within like 12-14 hours, I got waitlisted for the same.",

Most employers don\u2019t understand the difference between a diploma and an advanced diploma, then with Canada being the only country I\u2019m aware of that has advanced diplomas, companies just ask for a bachelors 90% of the time. So tldr; get the bachelors of technology.",

Eng.\n\nYou just need to complete technical examinations.\n\n[https://techexam.ca/2023/01/what-is-a-technical-exam-your-ladder-to-professional-engineer](https://techexam.ca/2023/01/what-is-a-technical-exam-your-ladder-to-professional-engineer)\n\nHere are the topics.\n\n[https://engineerscanada.ca/become-an-engineer/examination-syllabi](https://engineerscanada.ca/become-an-engineer/examination-syllabi)\n\nEGBC has a handy self-assessment form.\n\n[https://www.egbc.ca/Become-a-Member/How-to-Apply/Academic-Examinations-and-Syllabi/Engineering-Syllabus](https://www.egbc.ca/Become-a-Member/How-to-Apply/Academic-Examinations-and-Syllabi/Engineering-Syllabus)\n\nYou could use either of these BCIT programs as a stepping stone.\n\nSurely one of them you could step right into the third year with your existing diploma. Likely that would be the [B.Tech](https://B.Tech).",

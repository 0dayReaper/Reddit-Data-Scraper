    "postText": "I am considering taking the marketing diploma at BCIT. I've heard good things but is it worth the hype? Do students learn how to actually do things or is it more theory and essays? Are graduates in high demand like I've heard, or is it hard to find a job?\n\nI've completed a bachelor's degree in social sciences &amp; looking to supplement it with a niche, digital marketing. I've completed a few online courses about the subject but I want to learn on campus, with knowledgeable educators, networks, and can access opportunities that only come with being a student at a reputable program (internships, networking, references etc.). I don't want to make the mistake of writing useless essays for another few years and hope to come out with a solid practice of industry tools, a portfolio, and connections to potential employers. I want to be able to compete for solid jobs and make a decent income after I've completed the diploma. \n\nWould love to hear from the perspective of students and graduates of this program, especially those who took the communications and tourism options. Thanks.",

Of the 30 in my class, all of them got hired 1 week after grad. Some before. You learn how to do it through project based assignments and groups. No silly theory and essays that have nothing to do with marketing. I remember one of the highlights was when we got a project to find a company to write a report on. My group and I were like \u201check we\u2019re in marketing, let\u2019s google the top 5 marketing agencies in Vancouver, cold call and ask\u201d the top 5 called back and invited us to their office. Turns out 80% of their staff at the time was from bcit and they understand what you go through and the quality of the program.\n\nOnly downside to bcit is that their courses may not transfer outwards\u2026.if you want to do your bba elsewhere or if you change your mind and take something at sfu/ubc. A lot of them didn\u2019t transfer for me.",

If I wanted to transfer to accounting in bcit, I couldn\u2019t get I because there needed to be a \u201cseat\u201d available as in, if someone from the accounting program quits or fails out, I would be able to get that seat. However, i would already be missing some courses to be able to get into that streamline. Decided to get into ubc/sfu route for accounting instead for school reputation with big4 dreams.",

Back then in 2009 digital marketing and graphic design was still new. I came from a graphic design background and people liked what I created when making product packaging design, presentation materials etc. think you can get a digital marketing thing with google.",

There's a lot of practical work. The first year is more theory (with a couple group projects that are practical) but second year is all practical all the time. From market research, digital ads planning, full client pitches, etc. \n\nI did an undergrad first, then did the comm program and I'd do it again in a second.",

So job prospects are pretty good here.\n\nBig difference between BCIT and other schools is BCIT is heavily Hands-On and teamwork versus just theory. Employers tend to like that as they know you'll roll up your sleeves and get stuff done versus just think about it endlessly",

I\u2019m almost done my diploma and what I\u2019ve learned so far is exactly what I need to know for my career.\n\nThe profs were very helpful and willing to assist outside of class. It was pretty fun tbh, doing assignments that I know I would do in my career. \n\nThere are alot of research assignments tho and a lot of group work. I believe 80% of my classes were strictly based off group projects so you have to enjoy working with others. Other than that pretty fun classes like social media marketing where you just create tiktok or ig content.",

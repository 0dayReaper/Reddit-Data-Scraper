    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI am going into the New Media Design and Web Development in May and I have some questions that I've been struggling to find out:\n\n1. I know it's a designed base program and it says a minimum requirements of    \nProcessor64-bit Intel\u00ae or AMD\u00ae multi-core processor with SSE4.2 instruction setMemory16 GB minimum (32 GB for 4K media or higher)GraphicsNvidia GeForce GTX 1050 or equivalent; Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 or Quadro T1000 is recommended.  \n**or**  \nAMD Radeon Pro 555X or higher  \n**or**  \nIntel UHD Graphics 630 or higher\n2. It says it's a blended program any information on that?\n3. Is there anything I should do to get prepared before the program start date?\n4. Finally, can someone give us a day in the life\n\nI can't seem to find much information that isn't close to a decade old and that worries me. The program seems to be busy and always filling up in advance yet never talked about? seems strange to me. Hope someone can help and thanks in advance!",

I guess I'm just wondering if y'all would think it would be a decent enough laptop to use during this course. I have a GeForce GTX 1050 which it says is the above basic required card. And it says 16gb of ram, I have 32gb. I have a Ryzen 5 4600H CPU as well. It's a 6 core processor. I'm going to try and download the free trials to see if I can run adobe decently in the mean time.",

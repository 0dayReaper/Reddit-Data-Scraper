    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nIm still in highschool rn doing a trade thing (electrical) where i will essentially complete lvl 1 by the time i graduate highschool.\n\nI wanna be an engineer and a red-seal electrician but I dont know if I would even be get accepted in first-year EE since i feel like nowadays to get into any credited engineering program the average grades of people applying are in the high 90's (like 95% average for all prereq courses).\n\nBesides Engl 12 where i got a low 90, my other prereq's for lvl 1 are only high 80's (87-88 for math 12, chem 11, phys 12), and I can't retake them for a better grade since im busy with another program, **would this be enough to get into level 1? I also have like no extra-curricular activities or sports that i participate in** (which im assuming makes me a boring candidate)**, does BCIT care about extra-curriculars?**\n\n**If im accepted into level 1,** **do I have to be a full-time student? like take 3 courses?** cause i want to be able to work as an electrician to get enough hours to get certified. **Is it possible to do all the level 1 courses part-time?** because the wording on one of the pdf's list that EE doesn't accept Direct Entry (*\"Students who are accepted to level 1 of the program may apply for individual course credits for a maximum of two courses in level 1 and two courses in level 2. Students who believe they are eligible for more credit than that, must apply as a Direct Entry Student. \\[BEng does not have Direct Entry\\]\")* **Does this mean im not allowed to do part-time for more than 2 courses and get credit for them because if I do I need to apply for direct entry? If I fail in a class, can i re-take it for a better grade next semester or will they kick me out of level 1? and would I need to reapply if they do kick me out, and if i do need to re apply, do the credits i got from the last attempt even count?**\n\nsorry for the question bombing im really just confused about it all and wondering if im blowing things out of proportion. Any advice will be appreciated!",

They don't really do part time from what I know unless you fail a class and go into a modified schedule. As for getting into Beng your highschool grades don't really matter. You have to do well enough in the common first year. I got in with an 83 average after year one. Hope this helps!",

You will be required to register and pay for 6-7 courses per term, with credit weights of 5.0, 6.0 typically. You can withdraw from classes for any reason before the withdrawal date, but you won't get the money back. This could be done once to cause you to become \"modified\" which is less than the full course load, and due to pre-requisite requirements, if you strategically withdrew from some courses, you could remain modified until graduation (you'd have a schedule resembling a student who withdrew or failed a first term course). I would not recommend this route but it could be done\n\nRegarding your comment about 3 courses being Full time, I did have to laugh a tiny bit. Full time BCIT vs. Full time elsewhere cannot really be compared without evaluating how many credits are earned. I know people from other institutions who consider their 4 courses for 12 credits to be an overwhelming \"full time\" course load - the first term of the EE program at BCIT requires 30 credits, 2.5 times greater than a 12 credit term.",

            "comment": "**First**, if you want to do both the red seal and the EE degree, focus on one the red seal first. You probably already know this, but to get the red seal, you need 4 levels of studying and something like 8,000 hours of work. That's the path my brother took as an electrician at BCIT and my other brother took as a heavy duty mechanic at BCIT. \n\nGetting the red seal out of the way will give you a pretty good financial base. You could then go back and take courses full time and have a good job in the summer of your first year. You might even be able to get EI if you're doing retraining or have some other grants. \n\n**Next**, I would look at SFU. I took the diploma in mech eng tech at BCIT years ago and the only people doing a part time load were ones that failed full time classes. \n\nI was accepted to the BEng in mechanical engineering, but I couldn't afford to quit work to study full time. I was told there was no part time option because of the EGBC accreditation requirements, so there went my options for becoming an engineer. SFU seems to have recently relaxed the full time course load requirement for engineering students from what I understand. SFU also offers courses all year (Sept to Dec, Jan to April, and May to August), so you can take courses in a more spread out manner.\n\nBCIT engineering programs don't have direct entry. You used to have to finish the two year diploma of technology then apply to the third year of the engineering program. They seem to allow entrance after the first year, but I'm not sure if you get the diploma after completing your second year or not. Levels 1-4 are the first two years (the diploma). Levels 5-8 are the last two years of the engineering degree.",

In the 4 years doing the apprenticeship, you can take courses to upgrade if you're missing chemistry or math or whatever else. You can even take some calculus and physics classes part time at SFU before you apply to engineering.",

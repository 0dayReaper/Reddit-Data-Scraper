We are gathering feedback from students on their business model and interest in a quick survey, found here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda2zk-vVH3cG\\_GA5Q77zArjlkZW6K\\_uzav0QUH5y5rzJNs6g/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda2zk-vVH3cG_GA5Q77zArjlkZW6K_uzav0QUH5y5rzJNs6g/viewform)\n\nThis service is geared towards post secondary students, so your participation would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "There's really not enough information in your business model/plan.  \n\n\nFor example, you get 4-6 items. only 1 fits well. You return the other 3-5 items. Do you get a full refund? partial refund? an extra 3-5 items the next month? or ? you've just paid for 4-6 items and got one you actually want?  \n\n\nAlso - in my experience most people going to buy used clothing are doing so to save money. especially post-secondary students on a budget. A service like this will add significant costs/overhead to a simple trip to the store. And you're still making a trip to the outlet or whatever on campus. And back if you want to return things. You've also lost the ability to make purchasing choices based on price.   \n\n\nAnd trying things is so important. I've tried 6+ different pants, all the same size, and had some falling off me, and some i couldn't button up. there is so much variation in size in used clothes.  I guess stuff stretches and shrinks depending on material and/or who wore them originally?",

It is very early days and what the business creators are hoping to gain from this survey is if there is even an interest or market for this kind of service. \nIf they deem it viable then more specifics about the model will be figured out and more research will be done. \n\nWe do appreciate your feedback and I can share it with the business creators, I am just a student doing research on their behalf. \nThanks!",

            "comment": "Not sure if you're open to ideas, but an in-person 'clothing library' with a monthly/recurring fee might work well too.  (Maybe different pricing teirs, depending on how many items you have on 'loan', or the length of time you can borrow them?)\n\nIt'll also remove shipping costs, but then you'll need customers to actually visit your store.  \n\nAn exciting part of thrifting for me is browsing through the shelves and finding exactly what I need, and (with online clothing subscription models in general) that part is diminished.  \n\nBeing upfront, I've never used clothing subscriptions before.  Just thought I'd share my two cents :)  Good luck on your assignment!",

All the clothing is sorted and packed somewhere else. \n\nThe model is not geared towards people who already love second hand shopping and who enjoy looking for those pieces. It is for people who don't have time to shop, or have other barriers affecting why they can't get out to a second hand shop, but still want a cheaper or eco friendly option to buying new. \n\nSo this survey will help us determine what percentage of people this actually applies to.",

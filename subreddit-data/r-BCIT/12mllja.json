    "postText": "I'm about to finish a part time certificate program and check my transcript to see that I have 44 credits but need 45. Problem is I already did all the required courses and required elective credits (5.5 where 5 are needed). \nProgram guidelines say you need to take extra electives to reach 45 but I'm wondering if BCIT ever gives exemptions. Cuz the smallest course credit-wise is 1.5 and I don't wanna be doing an extra class.",

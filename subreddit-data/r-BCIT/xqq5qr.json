I went to my program head and student rep and told them I was paying for x hours of education and I damned well wanted my money's worth. I don't know what he did in his other classes, but he stopped ending mine early.",

I had Bob last semester and yes, the subject is difficult however whenever I had questions or didn\u2019t understand the topics, I always went to him and he explained and he gives you a lot of opportunities to ask questions, people just rarely show up to his lectures and labs and then complain that he is not teaching properly. In my opinion he is teaching like a proper professor is supposed to, you yourself have to be interested in learning because he can\u2019t be spoon feeding you.",

CSC still more....I switched to full time at that point for CST and BTech because I didn't want to spend the next decade at it.\n\nDepending on what you're wanting to get to do, ASD or ACIS are enough to get you started down that path.\n\nThat said as well, what kind of \"tech\" are you wanting to do? If you're wanting to be an IT monkey, if you're competent with computers, you can get your foot in the door there with zero formal schooling. There are certifications and self study stuff down that path if you want to get into networking or management.\n\nSoftware development is a bit more of a beast.",

If you really want to make it work then there are some sacrifices you need to make.  \n\n\nFull-time, the sacrifice is that it is virtually not possible to work, although you can still do some part-time here and there.  \n\n\nPart-time, is a bit more expensive and can take longer, but again it is not impossible to close the gap of  length of time to finish cst.",

Were I doing Data Communications or Linear Algebra, 100% would not take more than two courses concurrently. Taking PHP and project management... can do one classes homework in the other class and still have time to surf reddit.\n\nRegardless, the last three years I've had less of a life than I would otherwise have, but still go out and socialize at least once a week, still find time to go to the gym.

But one of the recent change is that CST diploma flex has an elective for projects now.\n\nThe major difference between FT and Flex/PTS is the coop option. Flex/PTS doesn't have, rather, it is not viable to have a coop as of this moment. Although I know some people who are able to land a QA full time job or Internship in the tech industry with ASD or CSC, which can be counted somewhat as a coop.  \n\nAs for your own projects, it really will be up to your alley to create projects. There's a pros and cons between FT and PTS but it will still boils down to you how you will utilize your gained knowledge. \n\nIf you are going to ask for the quality of education, both have upsides and downsides. Though majority of the PTS professors are very much active in the industry because they are only teaching part-time also.\n\nYou might also want to do a hybrid FT/PTS, where you finish CSC first then do the remaining year in Full time to get the diploma. The downside is that you are not qualified for the co-op program offered at BCIT.\n\nTo end this, whether you choose FT or PTS, once you graduate, you are a cst diploma graduate at BCIT doesn't matter if you do FT or PTS.",

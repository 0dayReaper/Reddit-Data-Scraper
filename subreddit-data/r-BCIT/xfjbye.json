Pretty secluded, but just exposed enough for it to be risky if someone decide to look out the window with a pair of binoculars. After youre done with.....whatever you were doing, you can head back in, get on your knees and confess to God about what you two....or three or even just one was doing. Cleanse it all away. \nAlso the chili and carrots are coming in real good this year at the little rooftop garden nearby.",

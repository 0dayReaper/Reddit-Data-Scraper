It got worse in May when every other university was done and the summer vibe came but BCIT was still ramping up into finals week.\n\nI can't wait till I can enjoy my life again..",

I swear I've sat on my ass at my desk for hours every day through endless bongo lectures and assignments for the last two months. I feel and look like straight up ass and want nothing more than to just shut down for a while. My body's achin' and my brain is fried. \n\nHere's to the end.",

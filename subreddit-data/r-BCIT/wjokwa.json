            "comment": "I applied for electrical foundation back in March.\nI was also put in the waitlist due to my terrible grades back then. Even after 4 months, I wasn't given a seat. I'm assuming it could take up to a year depending on your grades. \nIdk if trades and engineering programs are the same, but I upgraded my grades, applied to ECET winter 3 weeks ago and got accepted within a day. Could be the same for electrical foundation. \nI might be wrong.. this is just my assumption.\nContact the admissions department. They'll answer all your questions and give you the info you need.",

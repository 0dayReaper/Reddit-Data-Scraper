Your best path is to finish the CIT diploma, get a job(it wont necessarily pay a lot) but take the job and then get a degree part time. I did the CIT diploma then worked while taking part time classes to get the BBA degree. ofc i was doing this throughout covid, so classes were virtual which made it possible as i didnt have to go to school. once you have experience and the degree then you have more choices to either go study furthur, get a better paying job, move out of bc etc",

You can check the first mathematics class out here: [https://www.bcit.ca/courses/mathematics-for-computing-comp-1114/](https://www.bcit.ca/courses/mathematics-for-computing-comp-1114/) \n\nAs you can see on there it says \"No pre-requisites...\". \n\nIf you are worried about marks from high school, generally BCIT part time doesn't check. It is a course by course scenario. Go to the course page you are going to take and check for pre-requisites. \n\nResource: They didn't check any marks of mine when I took level 1000 part time courses. And I confirmed with them it doesn't matter. Specifically, I was afraid my marks wouldn't count as I was out of high school for a while.   \nNote: They'll start checking your grades for your 1000 when you apply for 2000 courses. \n\nGood Luck.",

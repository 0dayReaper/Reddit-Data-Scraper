    "postText": "Just wondering if they already announced the scholarship award for this year for having a high gpa for the last 2 terms?\n\nI\u2019ve read on some older threads that they announce it around early October to early November. I checked with the office staff a few weeks ago, they said they don\u2019t have it yet\u2026and that if they do, they won\u2019t be able to tell me. \n\nI thought I might have a chance with a 96 gpa and I could really use the money for next term\u2019s tuition fee. Just wondering if anyone already received an email or award this month?",

I asked how to get financial aid this term and since I\u2019m an international student they told me I don\u2019t have options, and mentioned that I might be eligible for this award since I already finished a year. But looks like I didn\u2019t make the cut. Anyway, thanks!",

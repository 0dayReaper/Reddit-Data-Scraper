    "postText": "I am an international student with 7A* in olevels and 3A* in Alevels and will give Ielts in September. I have heard a lot of good reviews of the CST and CIT program and want to join the CIT diploma first as I think the application for CST has ended. \nI had a few questions which if answered would help me a lot!\n\n1) Is the CIT diploma okay for someone fresh out of highschool and with no bachelor's (also, I don't really have much knowledge on programming and am a complete beginner)?\n\n2) Can I carry over my credits and make the diploma into a bachelor's degree (my mom is quite against my decision on having a diploma with my results so I probably will like to make it into a degree)?\n\n3) Will just my Alevels and CIT diploma at least get me a job (I know jobs aren't guaranteed and there is a hella lotta competition still I would at least like to get a part-time job to pay my expenses and study for a degree maybe)?\n\n4) Is this CIT diploma just recognized in BC (I meant mostly recognized or familiar with employment outside of BC or Canada; I have heard BCIT is quite famous in BC but not so much outside of BC)?\n\n5) I have my options on ..\n     a) CIT 2-year diploma then carry over my credits and make into a degree in another 2 years or more maybe (along with getting a good job that at least covers my expenses).\n     b) A CS degree of YorkU or USask.\nWhich one would be preferable?\n\nI would be really grateful if y'all took the time to answer my few questions as I really am an indecisive anxious mess right now.",

CST can transfer as 1 year to SFU CS but that's 2 years for 1 year worth of credits.\n3. Yes.\n4. Pretty much, to put it short.\n5. If you want to transfer your diploma into a degree. CIT is not a good diploma to transfer credit even asking admission team at BCIT as of now (no idea in the future). CST diploma has the option to turn into a bachelor's at BCIT or SFU.\n\nBut to answer your options go with B, in my opinion.\n\nI would recommend YorkU as it is in GTA (General Toronto Area), you will have more fun in the city oppose to Saskatoon... in the middle of nowhere. Plus you could find part-time jobs easier in a city if needed.",

After the CIT Diploma, you can ladder into BCIT's [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) degree provided you complete some bridging courses via part-time studies.  I don't know what the bridging courses are so you'll have to contact someone here:  [https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-information-technology-diploma-full-time-5540dipma/#contacts](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-information-technology-diploma-full-time-5540dipma/#contacts)\n3. I don't know what A-levels so I can't answer the question regarding this but I will say the CIT diploma is designed to make you employable upon graduation.  I will highly recommend keeping you grades up and applying for the co-op program while you're in the program.  It will greatly increase your chances of getting a job upon graduation\n4. Yes, the CIT Diploma is predominantly recognized in BC.  If you want to open your options outside of BC, you'll need to gain work experience within BC and then move.\n5. If you have the option of doing a CS degree, then definitely do the CS degree.  Employers still recognize CS degrees over diplomas &amp; CS degrees are still more recognized within Canada and internationally.  So if your idea is leave your doors and options open, then I'd recommend this route.",

            "comment": "Short answer: go with a degree first.  \n\nLong answer: CIT is a little lighter on the load and feels more scattered.  It is not as mature as CST that's for sure.\n\nComputer science really isn't something that people can spoon feed well.  I would recommend CIT only if you know what you want and are willing to work for it.   Otherwise you will likely be disappointed with the result.   \n\nEven for CST it just means the lower bar is higher, how close you are to the higher end depends on you. Those people from CST that got into FAANG would likely have gotten there even if they took CIT.",

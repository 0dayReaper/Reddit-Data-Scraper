    "postText": "I'm currently deciding whether I should apply for the Sep 2022 term or Jan 2023 term for ECET. I'm studying Ap Calculus, and doing Chemistry 12 and AP Physics soon to prepare myself for the first year courses. My plan is to complete what I'm doing to fully prepare myself, however my parents are pressuring me to apply for the Sep intake. I've struggled alot mentally in the past and overall my current mental health isn't too good either. I heard BCIT students are constantly under pressure and stress, and I feel like if I get in too early I'm gonna break apart. \nMy grades are Pre-cal 12 98 percent, Physics 12 95percent, English 95 percent and Chemistry 11 96 percent. I'm not sure how BCIT applications are processed, but I feel like my grades are good enough to be accepted early.\n\nAdvice on when I should apply, why I should apply at this time and extra advice regarding other things about bcit would be great.\n\nThank you\n\nEdit: My apologies if this isn't the right place to ask about this.",

            "comment": "You seem to have made up your mind already, but I think I can help reinforce your decision. I have similar grades and I was also having to make the same decision. My extended family is very critical with current state of UBC and SFU programs because of their business like approach to education and lack of guaranteed job/business opportunities after finishing. My family members are university grads from these schools as well if you believe me. However, they very much like the BCIT approach to education because it gets you ready for the work force and apparently better connections with businesses within the industries they provide education for. BCIT is practical experience, UBC/SFU theoretical education is the general idea at this time.",

            "comment": "As an instructor, I recognize it is hard for me to know what the pressure of a full program is like. However, I have a couple of observations. Firstly, students typically don\u2019t fail due to lack of intellectual capability. Rather, they fail due to lack of focus, lack of work ethic, or self sabotage, i.e., they stop showing up, don\u2019t complete assignments, or critique themselves into paralysis. Secondly, going to post-secondary school before you are ready or into a program or field you are not sure about is a great way to waste you or your parent\u2019s money. School is a huge investment! It\u2019s hella costly. Lack of efficiency in studying and achieving that qualification is a luxury that most cannot afford. \n\nSo, these two points both relate to readiness and support your apparent intention to start in January. The question I am left with, after looking through your post, is what makes you think you\u2019ll be more \u201cready\u201d in January? What are you planning to do between now and then to improve your logistical readiness, your mental state, your focus, or your academic capability? Your parents may feel like they don\u2019t want to just pay for you to relax for the next four months. Is there some tangible reason why you need the extra time? Answering this question well may help you to convince them to back off the pressure.\n\nAnd, finally, whenever you do go, and for everyone else out there studying anywhere, don\u2019t freak out! Keep your nose in the game, get everything in on time to the quality you have time for (and befitting the marks attached), work as hard as you can and do your best, obviously, but forgive yourself for poor marks or missteps. Take breaks as needed, try to have fun, and manage your scope to maintain your body and soul.",

It doesn\u2019t matter if that is accomplished in the first year or if it takes longer. \n\nIn my year 1/3 dropped out after the first semester.  The material is tough but not impossible. It is the amount of information that you learn all at once that challenges people. Stress and pressure is inevitable so if you are someone is at risk, take you foot off the gas and complete the courses on your own terms.  No one cares how long it took and on that fancy paper you get at the end, there is no start and finish date printed on it. \n\nGood luck.",

I only want to focus on my studies that are directly related to my major and career. I heard bcit profs have close connections with the industry and also the employment is great for bcit graduates. I also love how bcit classes are very small just like highschool. \nCouple people did advise me to try out ubc or sfu first, but will that really benefit me? I just want to gain knowledge, learn and have fun with the major I'm going into, graduate quickly, and get a job.",

Most people out of high school have a very hard time adapting to the BCIT rigour. If for any reason you end up doing bad in ECET diploma, you won\u2019t have a chance to get into the degree program, if that\u2019s something you care about that. At least in university you have more flexibility in how many courses you can take. If you want practical experience you can do co-op and get hands on experience from that. If you think you can handle the intensity at BCIT then by all means go ahead. It\u2019s a good school",

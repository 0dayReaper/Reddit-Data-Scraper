    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI recently graduated with a BBA from SFU and was wondering if anyone here has some light to shed about the Business Analytics Graduate Certificate program. I'm wondering if professors help students land jobs in this program as they might through other Business/IT Diploma programs such as CISA, and if the course material learned is actually useful in the real world.\n\nAny insight on the program is appreciated, thanks",

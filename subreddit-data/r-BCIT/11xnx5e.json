Some labour intensive papers but I found the grading fair bordering on easy. I am a \u2018mature student\u2019 with a bachelors though so I already had experience with post secondary coursework. I\u2019m not working in project management, how easy it will be to find a job depends on what other skills you have eg if you\u2019re looking to be a tech PM, what experience do you have in tech?",

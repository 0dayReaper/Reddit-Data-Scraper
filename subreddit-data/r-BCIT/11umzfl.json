    "postText": "I'm cutting reddit out of my life, so I'll do something useful before I go and answer any questions you have about CST, my career or anything else.\n\n\nNever had any post secondary education before starting CST in 2018 as an mid-20s student. Did 8 month coop. Did cloud computing option. GPA 90%. Graduated at end of 2020. Got job in Jan 2021 with Fortune 500 as full stack web developer. Been working there 2 years now.\n\n\nSalary &amp; Career Progression:\n\n- Coop: $18 per hour.\n\n- Fortune 500 salary: $90k TC (total compensation). Base $80k, Stock $10k.\n\n- year 1 annual raise: $100k TC. Base $90K, Stock $10k.\n\n- year 2 annual raise: $120k TC. Base $100k, Stock $20k.\n\n\nCurrently working towards either a promotion or switching company. If I don't get promotion by end of summer, I will look to switch jobs by end of year. Slowly ramping up my interview prep.\n\n\nLoved my time in CST, would recommend the program over a bootcamp and even a degree if you don't have 4-5 years of commitment that a degree requires. Tuition is cheap (I paid 14-16k and money I earned from coop paid it off). Made great friends that I hang out regularly to this day. Only negative is that some new instructors were very bad,  and you will need to do extra learning/projects outside of school to get a job and do well in that job.",

Wednesday was only half day of classes in the morning to 12-1pm. I would do 2-3 hours on Wednesday of studying. So around 10 hours Mon,Tues,Thurs,Friday; 6 hours on Wed; 6 hours on weekend. \n\nFor me, I worked the hardest in term 1, because grades in Term 1 determine if you get into the coop program and I really wanted to get in. For our year, there was only 50 spots in coop, out of approx 250 students. Not sure if they have increased the number of spots since then.",

Companies will still pay this much but there will be more competition for these jobs since there are less of them and way more graduates to compete with because of the economy right now.\n\nAfter doing coop, I knew what skills and knowledge I lacked, so when I went back to school I knew what to study and train for. I had another year before graduating, so I spent most of my time studying and doing projects to work on the areas I lacked in. Plus I practiced leetcode and interview prep frequently too. The pandemic happened during this time, so there was not much else to do other than study at home.",

If you do want to learn cloud, the better option is to get a certification from AWS or Azure. I got an AWS cert during BCIT and it did help me get interviews for cloud jobs. It does cost quite a bit especially if you are a student ($200 when I did it), but I considered it an good investment. \n\nMy advice for choosing an option: It doesn't matter to employers very much, I and my peers didn't get asked about it much. So instead pick an option based on what you want to learn or location (downtown vs burnaby) or the ones your friends picked. I choose cloud as my first and analytics second because I wanted to go to the downtown campus so I didn't have to transit long and be with my friends.",

Take a online programming course, I recommend CS50 from Harvard, its really good. After you get in though, you need to job hunt. So I suggest doing a project to put on your resume and start practicing easy leetcode problems (string manipulation, arrays, etc).\n\nMy coop was great.

Several have quit their jobs since it started.\n\nIf you have a kid, I think it's probably impossible  to work at the same time.\n\nYou won't always have a full 8 hour day, but depending on how well you're understanding the material you will likely want to spend some time studying outside of school  too.  Don't know about welding specifically,  but a lot of the other programs have written tests on materials, trade knowledge,  safety, etc.\n\nMy advice would be to save til you can afford to pay your expenses  during school,  then live like a monk.",

Only good part is that they always had projects due on Monday and I would be able to catch up then and when we had tests I would occasionally take a day off for strictly studying. That was 6 months but it was well worth it. I had no choice as I had bills to pay and wanted a career change haha.",

    "postText": "Planning to apply at the end of this year. My high school average was about 92%. I will be graduating in June 2024 with a BSc majoring in Health and Disease and Psychology at the University of Toronto. My cgpa is around 3.5, but my marks are a bit inconsistent. My sessional GPA ranges from 3.0-4.0. I also have around 70 hours of volunteering in healthcare. No research experience yet. Since BCIT only allows one application, I wanted to make sure that I have a high chance before applying! \n\nThanks.",

I expect MLS and Sonography to have similar cutoffs, so you'll definitely have a good chance of getting in :)",

Its curriculum is actually very well crafted to provide you with the tools you need to succeed on the job, and I was actually pleasantly surprised by how good quality the education was here.  There are also plenty of jobs currently available on the market, so you're likely to get hired right out of school, although some of these jobs have some downsides (working nights and such).  If you're afraid of working with blood and other human samples though, it's probably not for you.\n\nI've been down this \"what to do after life science graduation\" rabbit hole so if you have anymore questions, you can pm me.",

The BCIT program is focused on relevant knowledge and clinical/practical skills so I wouldn\u2019t worry about the research side. As far as I know there\u2019s still only one big research project, and it\u2019s geared toward people with zero prior experience. Focus on hands-on patient care and anatomy/physiology knowledge, and physical strength/mobility/dexterity (especially core and upper body - US is waaaay harder on the body than people think). Good luck!",

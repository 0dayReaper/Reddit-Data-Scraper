            "comment": "Hey! In my experience I've always paid my tuition out of my savings because student loans can take a bit to deposit into your account, so you may not recieve it by friday. Paying with your savings will ensure you aren't dropped from your classes. Ensure to pay your tuition asap as it can take a few days to process.\n\nIf you dont have the savings &amp; are solely relying on a student load, you can defer your tuition payment date. There's more information here https://www.bcit.ca/financial-aid/tuition-fee-deferral/\n\nHope this helps \u263a\ufe0f\n\nEdit: the loan will cover whatever you want it too (disregarding education grants). For example, I can afford the tuition for the program I'm in but can't afford living expenses- so while my student loan is solely for education, it's true purpose is ensuring I have a space to live / food.",

But if you need to pay asap, I would just pay out of pocket, because the Application for Fee Deferral can take up to 7 business days in my experience. But once they receive it, the student can register into the course without paying (obviously the student aid admin would do this for the student though).",

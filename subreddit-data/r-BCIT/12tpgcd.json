I would recommend getting in as soon as possible to not waste time. Only after you are in can you actually tell if you can do the program or not. If you want to make it to the degree part of the program, be prepared to study 60 hours a week for easy going weeks. Busier weeks easily take 70 hours of studying a week to stay afloat.",

    "postText": "Ngl, all the news about the massive layoffs and people posting their layoff stories on LinkedIn has me nervous af about 2023. I'll be graduating in May 2023 and even with prior coop experience, I've only heard back from 3 out of the 120 companies I applied to. A career advisor has looked at my resume multiple times already and even they think it should be decent to land at least one job. What are you guys doing to prepare for 2023? Should I keep applying or wait until September so I can start the [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) in CS that BCIT will be rolling out to make myself more competitive?",

I encourage you to still apply to jobs. if you think you're being picky with the position, then maybe make urself more flexible. it rlly depends on how badly u need it. continuing school is also not a bad option during recession. I've heard that advice from my network. It's what im gonna do. I've also heard ppl say make sure you specialize in one thing in comp sci during recession and work on your skills.\n\nSo it rlly goes back to your mentality and how you take it. always try to turn something bad into an opportunity for urself. rn the job market is pretty crappy, but it gives space to sharpen your skills and grow ur skills.\n\nI don't want what I've said to come off as insensative. I need the pay aswell. but sometimes its necessary to acknowledge a reality, you won't be able to properly use it ur advantage through this shit if you're constantly clouding yourself with the anxiety.",

With that being said, you\u2019re in a good position at the moment with coop experience and hearing back from 3 companies is pretty good. You can keep applying and see if you land a position that you like, if not go for the Bachelor if that\u2019s what you want to do. A lot of my friends in tech are currently doing fine too. LinkedIn and media tends to over-blow things out of proportion. But it makes sense since tech has been doing very well the past decade so it\u2019s a talking point",

For instance, I don't think I made a single post on LinkedIn since I started working.\n\nYes, the job market is tough, but sooner or later these corporate skunks will realize that senior developers were once junior developers, and all it took is some on-the-job training.",

    "postText": "Does everyone feel like they have no social life here and 8 courses with quizzes and assignments every week is a little inhumane? \n\nEspecially in a 2 year program that is .. well... just a diploma? \n\nMy undergrad was in science and very difficult, and here I find that the effort it would normally get me 90%+ is giving me 80 % and smack on average results. We do have a small set - 8 people this term who are all sadly very smart, but still. I'm doing mostly well and everything and I'm no slouch, but yeah no one seems to be talking about how nuts this is and how they survived. Just a little disheartening that it feels like I'm totally killing myself studying every day and night just to make average and I don't know how to step it up from all the stuff I'm already doing. \n\nPlease share your story of your first semester lol was it just as overwhelming? Did it get better? \n\nP.s. I'm trying to stay on campus for longer hours to study but it seems really dark in a lot of spaces and very much a commuter school/empty and depressing after 2 pm. Any good study locations? I used to live in the coffee shops on campus and library at sfu.",

            "comment": "As an instructor, understand how you are feeling - we have actually brought this up to BCIT when discussing student mental health issues (I was involved in a discussion of how we can help students navigate the online learning transition due to Covid, and this point was raised multiple times). The intensity of programs at BCIT is something that needs to adjust (or at least options for slower pacing should be introduced).\n\nIn regards to the grades - I cannot speak to the particulars in your courses, but I would offer the following advice:\n\n1. Ask for marking rubrics/descriptors: Teachers should be providing (or be able to provide upon request) the tools they will use to grade you. This will also help you discern whether you are being norm referenced (graded on a curve, where the presence of very smart people will impact your grade) or criterion referenced (where your peers' performance means nothing as you are graded against a set criteria).\n2. I produce an editable semester calendar for my students to help them with time management - seeing where all your assignments are in one place can help you with any time management issues you might be struggling with and help you better organize your study time to make it more efficient. DM me if you would like me to provide you with a copy of the calendar.\n3. Plan out your courses in advance in as much as you can - I have students, for example, who are trying to get into nursing, and are taking as many electives as possible now so they do not have to do them when studying nursing because they know how tough it will be, particularly when doing praxis. This has also been the case in other programs with pre-reqs or co-reqs for graduation.\n\nI am not sure if this helps, but hopefully it does (even if only a little).",

This is nothing new, but I get your need to talk about it - maybe consider talking to someone in [Counselling and Student Development](https://www.bcit.ca/counselling/)?",

Always happy to Zoom with students who are struggling and/or need to vent.",

FOr 2 years life was a miserable hell for me while i was in my full time program of studies, i ended up doing the bachelors degree part time for this reason. granted i finished my full time diploma before covid, so i can only imagine how much tougher this must be for you guys.\n\nhang in there, dont quit and don't think too much of your gpa just get through it, by the time i got to lvl 4 i was absolutely burnt out and was doing the bare minimum to pass it is deffs inhumane but there isn't much you can do except for put your head down let other stresses of life go and just do your best",

Our first semester was insane, I spent about 8-12 hours on the computer pretty much 7 days a week trying to keep up with it all, had no social life (to be fair this was 2020 when I started, so peak COVID times, we couldn't do anything anyways lol) and it was definitely hard on my mental health wondering if I was going to fail the program every other day. THAT BEING SAID... the first semester was the worst (currently in term 4 of a 5 term diploma program) and it does get better! \n\nMy advice is to just focus on doing well in those really hard courses that are giving you the most trouble and try not to worry too much about just getting \"average\" marks as long as you are passing! You will improve as the program goes on. \n\nP.S. I used to study in the ehpod  mostly but NE1 cafeteria space is a bit brighter of an area to study and isn't too busy as long as you're there after hours !",

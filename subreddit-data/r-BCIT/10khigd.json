    "postText": "I'm a UBC grad living in Vancouver, still awaiting my PR. I'm trying to submit an application for Geomatics Diploma as soon as possible but it requires \"Physics 11\" and nothing on my UBC transcript fulfils this and I don't think I took it in high school.\n\nI see a lot of options to easily get this for Canadian Citizens/PR/refugees through free post high school courses, but it seems more complicated for others. I've reached out to place like Columbia &amp; VCC but its unclear if this is offered for international students.\n\n It seems BCIT offers this but its not offered until the fall when the program I want to do starts, and I don't think I can take it at the same time since the initial application requires it.\n\nIt seems possible, but looking for advice to cheapest and fastest way to complete this so I can get an application in.",

            "comment": "I was in s similar situation, most (if not all) places that offer high school courses for free for pr/citizens also accept international students for a fee. When I looked it up a few years back it was around $500. \nReach out to each school and see what they offer. I ended up getting my PR sooner than I expected and took it for free. \nI took 2 courses on ebus academy, it\u2019s a northern bc online school. Highly recommend it, the layout and platform are very nice, both instructors provided videos and interactive labs and you book time with an \u201cinvigilator\u201d for your midterm/final vs attending in person exams for most local schools.",

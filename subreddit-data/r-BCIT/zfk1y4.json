I have a medical degree but no MOA or dental administration certificate. \n\nCan anyone tell me what to expect with salary/wage for someone who would have just finished the MOA/ dental admin certification? Indeed has a lot of wages listed in ranges or listed as \u201cup to $30/hour\u201d but I\u2019d assume a new graduate might be getting paid lower? \n\nTHANK YOU in advance!",

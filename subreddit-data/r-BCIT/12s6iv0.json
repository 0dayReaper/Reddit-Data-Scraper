    "postText": "I applied BCIT cit 2023 Fall intake with 7 in IELTS and 93 in Math 12. And I am an adult student with art background. However, I  heard about the score 7 in IELTS and 98 in math have been in the waiting list in the early deadline of March.\n\nSince the final deadline is the end of April, I haven\u2019t got any feedback from authority.\nI am worried about if there is a chance for me to get in.\n\nCould you please advise if the score is OK or I need to prepare it and reapply in the next circle?",

Have you tried reaching out to them?  \n\n\nBTW, have you considered CST?",

Yes, I considered CST at first, but considering it\u2019s more highly competitive, I changed my mind.\nI haven\u2019t contacted with the staff, probably wait until deadline. \nYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s not bad to prepare for reapply. I\u2019ll try.\nThanks again!",

It is not a well known way of getting into diploma. Since the disadvantage is you will not be eligible for the BCIT coop with that route",

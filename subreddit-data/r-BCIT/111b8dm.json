I\u2019m in second year and we only did a programming course in Python, with a little bit of bash scripting in the Linux course.",

Therefore it is still evolving and improving.\n\nIt is very much an Industrial-oriented  IT and OT Networking program with Cybersecurity thrown in there as well. A great way to get started in a vast field.",

I assume extra certifications like network+ and security+ will do no harm? Asking because I was searching on job boards for roles graduates could take on, but there don't seem to be especially relevant ones.",

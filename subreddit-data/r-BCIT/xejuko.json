    "postText": "Hi guys. Title, basically. I have an 83 in my English class and an 81 in my Math class. I've heard average acceptance normally sits around the mid-high 80s and I'm a bit nervous.\n\nIs it worth noting I'm an adult student and would be applying five years out of highschool with as many of relevant work experience? I don't know how any of this school stuff works, I did not care for it at the time - it's only a recent thing I've been put on due to my job prospects not being as good as I would otherwise have hoped.\n\nThanks everyone, appreciate any insight.",

            "comment": "Yes it is possible. I have people in my cohort who have averages in the 70s who got in.\n\nThere are many adult students who have been out of high school for more than 5 years so don't worry. I, myself, am out of high school for 10 years. People with previous university degrees or went to university before etc.\n\nIf you have any experience in python, it would be a plus! In my opinion, you're likely to get in, hopefully, that eases your mind :)\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention I am in CIT Term 2",

Some instructors were absolutely terrible, but some are quite pleasant and nice and good instructor etc. That's just life, I guess.\n\nI found the course load to be very doable and a reasonable amount of stress. Other people in my program may say otherwise.   \n\n\n*Note: Time management is very important, it took me over 4 years to learn. I usually just complete the assignment/quizzes/projects right away oppose to worrying about the deadline (so if it was assigned on that day, work on it on the day of or within a few days).*   \n*Before, I used to complete the assignment by the deadline, so if I had 3 weeks for the assignment, it would be completed and hand in exactly on the day of the deadline (this strategy was horrible for me and assignments pile up)*\n\nIn the first term, just focus on learning python/javascript and you know, give a reasonable amount of effort for other courses and you'll be fine. I say focus on python and javascript as I find this will be give me a bit of trouble in term 2. I enjoyed database the most out of all the courses. \n\nJust started the second term, so far, it gets a bit more interesting. Networking (in terms of computers), Linux System Administration, Object-oriented programming, Javascript (back-end). The not-so-interesting other courses are Business System Analysis and Business Communications.\n\nJust from looking at the future courses, it should be more interesting like Cloud Computing . Term 3 people are learning through Minecraft in one of the courses. So Minecraft might be a school expense in the future, if you haven't purchased it already.\n\nThere's co-op for this program but be aware the pay is around $22 so just a little bit above minimum wage, where the same job outside of the co-op program can be almost double of that. Although, I find the experience will be valuable as it's a great learning environment in the real-time working world and people hiring always want people with experience (if I make it to the top 20 GPA in the cohort).  \n\nAnyway, kind of just blabbed any insight that came to mind.   \n\n\nOverall, I like this program.",

I just needed to do the COMM 0033 test cause my english requirement fell short of 80. Also applied 5 years out of high school. I think you have some good chances! just apply as early as you can because I applied the week after the applications opened (idk if registration date matters). I hope this gives you peace of mind :)",

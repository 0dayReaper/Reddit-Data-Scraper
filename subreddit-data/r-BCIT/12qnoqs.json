    "postText": "BC Hydro apprenticeship sounds like boot camp.  Do they really make you move to four different BC cities over the four years in addition to the classroom learning? This seems unnecessarily intense/disruptive but I guess it will definately weed out those who aren't serious. My question for you is:. Is it worth the trouble in your experience?",

At least you won't have a problem finding an apartment if you apply with the bchydro email... At any rate it's a pretty cushy job so it's worth it if you want to work in BC.",

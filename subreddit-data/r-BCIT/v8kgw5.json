    "postText": "Hi. Ive been accepted i to the part time cardiology technology program. Although its officially a part-time program, im hoping to get through it quickly by taking on a full course load to finish in 2 years. Has anybody else done this or in progress? The first term has 6 classes which seems like it may be too heavy but some are shorter with less credits. I need 12 credits to be full time. Should i just start with that or register for all 6 classes. Plese help!!",

I would say like anything,it depends.If you are not working currently then I think it's 100% doable but if you are working, then you may take a hit on your marks depending on your study habits.\r  \n\r  \nSince all the courses are online, be prepared for A LOT OF READING EVERY WEEK especially with 2202,1101, and 2219(arguably the hardest course for first year).  The course content  for the first term isn\u2019t hard by any means but the volume is definitely the problem. Second term is more difficult conceptually and will require a few hours every day to prevent falling behind. \r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*Also keep in mind 2201 ECG interpretation is a 70% pass\\*\\*",

Do you think it\u2019s doable to continue working while taking all of it? Also how was the program delivery? Were there live online classes like on zoom or google meet or do they just post materials and video clips? Sorry I have a lot of questions. I\u2019m just really nervous and excited at the same time to start the program \ud83d\ude05",

    "postText": "As the title says, I really dropped the ball on a pre-requisite course for a program i thought i wanted to attend. The course was Foundations of Anatomy and Physiology as the biology pre-requisite for the MRI program. However, ive had a change of heart and wish to attend the Biomedical Engineering program. Thing is, even though BioMed is related to medicine, it does not require a biology course as a pre-requisite, only math, physics, and chemistry. \n\nIm worried that my poor grade in my anatomy course will somehow affect my chances of getting into the biomed program as they are both related to medicine. Am I stressing out too much?\n\nThanks in advance.",

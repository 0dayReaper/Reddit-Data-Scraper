Given from the info I've seen online it is pretty difficult to work part time while doing the course due to the workload. But to those who have done this course, is it possible to juggle this course while working part time say 12-16 hours exclusively on the weekends?",

            "comment": "TL;DR - there are trade-offs to make, so it will depend on your goals. If you want to maximize your grades, work very little. If you need the money, accept that either your grades will suffer or you won't sleep / have a social life. \n\nI did engineering, so maybe not directly comparable, but I think all BCIT full-time diplomas have similar characteristics. First, you're completing three years worth of work in two years. Second, you have 4th term projects. I think the differentiator with business programs is more group work in terms 1-3. \n\nI don't know anyone in my engineering program that worked part-time that didn't fail courses and end up delaying graduation. Maybe there is a part-time studies option for you? \n\nI do have one friend that completed the marketing management diploma while working. Their strategy was to work early in the term while the workload was light and drop down to zero shifts in the last month when major projects and exams happened. \n\nThey had a degree already, so had figured out what study habits work for them. They took control of their project work and were willing to do more on their own. They didn't intend to go on to the BBA degree, so they weren't so focused on maximizing grades. \n\nI'm not sure the recruiting or hiring cycle for BCIT students. Some places start hiring in the fall (maybe around October) for April / May start. Others will hire in the spring term. My point is time spent looking for work would either come out of your studies or your shifts.",

            "comment": "Hey! Current 2nd year OPMAN student here. If you have great time management definetely work if you can. Theres obviously gonna be trade offs such as taking time to study or using that time to go to work. You can work weekends at the expense of any leisure time you would have to yourself. Its doable, some of my peers are working while in OPMAN. But you might feel a little more mentally burnt out faster or feel the stress of not having enough pocket money to go out. \n\nTL:DR Work if you want, its doable but burn out comes slightly faster.",

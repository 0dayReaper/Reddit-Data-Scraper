If you won't have completed 50% of the classes by that date, see whether your school district offers an online self-paced Chemistry 11 course. You could enroll in that, drop the in-person course, complete greater than 50% by the deadline and have the teacher sign the form. Also, if you've taken Chemistry 12 (I think that Chemistry 11 is a pre-requisite, but just checking), you should be able to use the grade in its place.",

There is an online course available, but I don't think I can cram what is normally 5 months of learning (according to the website it takes \\~10 months for the whole course) into 3.

Is it too much? I see the program is a blended online in person delivery so that might make it easier.\n\nThanks for the help!",

I dont recommend it but at the same its extremely difficult if not impossible to get by if you are also responsible for rent/food. If you have a free place to stay and not working is an option I personally would say do not work.",

I will say though that it would be helpful if you can get a job that is okay with a variable schedule. When you have midterms or finals it\u2019s nice being able to take some time off work to focus on studying. A casual position would be best.",

The desktop app was good for a while, but then it started training my battery, so I used the web app.\n\nObsidian requires you to pay each month for the syncing capability. AFAIK, no web app exists so you can only use it on your local machine. I used git and GitHub to save my notes.\n\nHaven't tried Remnote, so can't say.\n\nPersonally I used Notion at BCIT, just made a new page for each semester and then had the classes as subpages. I think you should start off like this, and then try Obsidian if you want a more minimalist experience.",

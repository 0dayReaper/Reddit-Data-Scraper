And so, I would like to know what the program is like at BCIT. Is the program useful for post-grad studies, and in the workplace?",

            "comment": "Are you entering fresh, as in starting in \"first year\"? Or are you trying to transfer in from somewhere else? Reason I ask is if you are starting as a first year, 100% go to BCIT and take the Architectural and Building Technology (ABT) diploma program as Year 1 and Year 2 before applying for BCIT Architectural Science in Years 3 and 4.\n\nEvery architecture/construction/engineering firm in BC holds the BCIT ABT program in high regard. Graduates are known to be able to hit the ground running.\n\nHowever, the drawback is that outside of BC, many BCIT credits are not transferrable and BCIT is not as well known of a school. So if you plan on doing international studies or work, BCIT could be a problem on paper (despite the vast amount of practical knowledge and experience you will gain).\n\nFrom what I hear about the Bachelors of Environment Design (ENDS) at UBC, they are largely behind on practical training. For example, students in the ENDS program only just start to learn AutoCAD while BCIT ABT students are plowing through AutoCAD in Year 1 and then Revit in Year 2.\n\nI am a BCIT ABT grad and been working in the industry ever since. Feel free to DM me if you have further questions or want to discuss.",

The new program introduces softwares that are earlier than ENDS did and includes courses on structure and building sciences",

For the creative test component, do your best to illustrate who you are as a person and what you care about, making sure to incorporate them into the designs you create. This will paint a better picture of who you are as a potential BDes student. My brother did the ABT program in BCIT and we found that his program was very technical and industry ready, which was good for finding jobs in the city. Meanwhile, I'm in the BDes program. I find that there is a lot of content on how to think critically and deeply when creating meaningful design within the architecture/landscape architecture/urbanism topics. However, the BDes program is still a design program. I will need to do my masters to do architecture irl. Meanwhile, BCIT's is a Bachelor in Architectural Science. What's better really depends on your priority and interest. Good luck!",

First, your mini domicile should showcase the needs of your chosen pet as well as the function provided. For example, does your house have enough space for food, resting etc? \n\nSecond, it is important to incorporate your OWN ideas instead of referencing from the building chosen. Admission officers do take your ideas and concept seriously. \n\nLastly, make sure to show your design thinking and process as well as PLAN your layout in order to look presentable and who you are as a designer. If you have any questions, feel free to dm me! :)",

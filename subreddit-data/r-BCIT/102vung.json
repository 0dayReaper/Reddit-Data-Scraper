    "postText": "Am I the only one that finds the myBcit website very hard to navigate and it's super confusing? In the website under tuition, I'm confused between \"term charges\", \"term credits and payment\", \"term balance\" and \"account balance\". Which one is the actual amount that I have to pay as tuition? I'm even more confused because some of them don't add up?? (Or does account balance add on from previous terms?)",

Login to mybcit &amp; click on student self service, scroll down &amp; you'll see \"Fee assessments, payments &amp; receipts\"- under that there is \"view tutition\" which is the amount you pay (:\n\nShoot me a DM if this doesn't clear up the confusion!",

I think it is a lot harder to get a job after taking that option unless you have some other experience or have a chance with BC Hydro.\n\nBut it really depends on what you are interested in.",

I think 90% of my cohorts also go jobs related to their study before they graduated. Currently in the Btech program working towards getting my PEng.",

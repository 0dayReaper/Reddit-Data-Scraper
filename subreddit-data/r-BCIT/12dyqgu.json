Question is what should I write aside from I really want this program. I'm not very good in talking about myself in many words and worried that if i keep it simple, I might not get it.",

If it\u2019s a program where leadership and teamwork are important, use this space to weave in why you want to take it and demonstrate some of those skills and how they'll help you.",

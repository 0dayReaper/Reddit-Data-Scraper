    "postText": "Hey r/BCIT!\n\nVancouver is described as an unfriendly place, where people are friendly but not friends. \n\nThat's why we're building **Dawn**, a friend-finding app where everyone's profiles consist only of interests and icebreakers. Everyone is anonymous otherwise.\n\nWe hope to foster stronger, more genuine friendships. It's all about mutual interests and good vibes at Dawn. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWe launched recently and have had over a hundred people make an account over the first few days! More people seem to trickle in day by day.  \n\nCheck us out and join the community \u2192 [https://joindawn.app/](https://joindawn.app/)\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments and would love to hear your thoughts on the concept! We're a bunch of UBC students btw, pretty cool to check your subreddit out :)",

The only \"friends\" are the people that we learn together with in class.\n\nBCIT is a very career first oriented kind of institute. We're usually very friendly &amp; nerdy, but in a very nice kind of way. When people hire us, they're usually pretty happy that we're very passionate (or nerd out) in our respective fields. Although, a friend app is kinda interesting. I think what I'm trying to say is, a break from nerding out would be sorta nice.",

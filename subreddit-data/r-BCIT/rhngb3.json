We had to scrape up a bunch just for a chance for me to go to BCIT and somehow it's happening. The issue here is uh... imposter syndrome is hitting me real hard and I'm really scared that I'm going to end up failing everyone that helped me get to this point.\n\nI remember reading a lot about how there are a lot of drop outs in BCIT and I just feel like I'm not going to end up lasting a year. I just barely managed to get by in high school, trying my absolute hardest in my last year and just barely managing to get enough to get into my program. I mostly just want some advice as to how I can try my best to not mess this chance up, or some comfort. Sorry that this post is a mess, 3 AM thoughts do be getting to me haha.\n\nEdit: I'm taking CST",

I remember feeling the same way too. \n\nIt's going to be really important that you stay on top of your classes every week. I taped the course schedule of all my classes onto the wall next to my desk so that I could always see what was coming up. Write on it. Keep track of what readings you've done and feel good about and what areas could use more review. Take breaks in between studying when you need them -- it's important to let yourself rest. And always remember that it's okay to ask for help, whether it's from your peers or your instructor. That's what they're there for. \n\nI'm rooting for you!",

Here are some tips: \n\nFocus on disciplining yourself with time management. Try to do a little bit of work even on lazy days. Slacking off for one day can be extremely difficult to make up for when you\u2019re bombarded with assignments. There have been many times when I have regretted taking a day to relax. \n\nAlways START your assignments as soon as possible. Simply initiating them and getting some starting progress can push you to work on them earlier and more frequently. Starting an assignment can be difficult when you\u2019re in the thick of it!\n\nYou can finish your lab work/assignments during the allocated class time for some courses. You have access to instructor help and alleviates some of the work load if you can finish them. You won\u2019t have to worry about it for the rest of the week!\n\nBe diligent when tracking your assignments and deadlines. Very few instructors will give you a pass if you miss a deadline; every mark counts so try to turn everything in! Use software like Trello to make sure you can visually see all your deadlines to have good awareness of your workload.\n\nTurn everything in, even if it\u2019s not fully complete. Partial marks are better than no marks.\n\nIf you\u2019re overwhelmed, pause to evaluate which deliverable is the most important to your grade. If a specific assignment is worth a larger percentage of your grade, focus more on that.\n\nTake out student loans! Always take out loans, even if you don\u2019t need them. They are interest free during the duration of your schooling, and you can obtain grants (needs based scholarships that don\u2019t need to be paid back).\n\nFinally, don\u2019t be scared of asking questions! The instructors are there to help you. If you think you\u2019re asking a stupid question, ask it anyways. It will take a lot more work to avoid the question out of embarrassment than it is to explicitly receive an answer from the instructor. You are likely a young learner, there\u2019s no such thing as a silly question if it helps your learning.\n\nPost-secondary education can be daunting, but with enough motivation, you can power right through it!",

Even if you can read a few pages a day, trying to hammer out 100+ pages of reading (per course) at the very end of the week sucks and will stress you out more than having a bit to do every day. Oh, also, write yourself flashcards for important things (formulas, etc.) as you go so you don't have to go back and create a bunch of study material before your exams.

I'd get a student advisor and see if they will help you come up with a study/homework schedule. I'd also contact student counseling and get a counselor to help with your thought processes and feelings. See if BCIT has peer support also. You've got this and can do it!",

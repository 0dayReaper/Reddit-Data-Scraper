    "postText": "I'm wondering what are the differences between the two programs, \"Global Trade &amp; Transportation Management\" and \"International Trade and Transportation Logistics\" apart from the program length and type. I assume the courses would be similar to each other?\n\nI've taken GTTM but found the full-time courseload a bit much, so I'm wanting to switch to whatever this part time program is. But I'm wondering a few things: Are they really that different? Apart from program length and type, I assume the courses offered are at least similar? Location is another thing, but it seems like ITTL offers some in downtown campus but It doesn't fit due to my location. \n\nApart from that, is it a good idea to change?",

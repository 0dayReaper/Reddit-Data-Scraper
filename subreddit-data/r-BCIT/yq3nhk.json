    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm registering for some graphic design courses which are offered both online and in person. I'm torn between which to register for. I've taken a few online courses before (only one from BCIT though), and I found that it really varies based on the prof and how engaged they are.\n\nOn one hand, I love the flexibility of online learning. No need to commute which saves time and money, ability to create your own workspace, you can be more comfortable especially if you aren't feeling your best that day, and interact at your comfort level. I've always been more of an independent learner. Also - as someone with poor health it has been a godsend covid wise. \n\nOn the other hand, there is always something missing for online classes, obviously. It feels less tangible, I never get to see my classmates or my prof face to face and have that level of depth of conversation, and it is easy to get distracted if my self discipline or attention span isn't great on that day. Classrooms to some extent create a better atmosphere for learning and connecting with others. \n\nI know it also depends on the subject, but I haven't taken design courses in person at BCIT before. The courses I'm looking at are mostly theory-based, apart from a handful of Adobe ones. I guess I'm wondering if people with more experience have thoughts regarding online vs in person at BCIT, it doesn't necessarily have to be design courses.\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m interested in taking the part-time Business Admin (Management) diploma program but noticed it requires 118 credits to complete. My organization is actually paying for my education, so I\u2019ll be working the standard 37.5 hours a week in tandem.  While filtering Reddit I see most full time workers who are studying part time say 2 courses would be the advised max amount of classes they\u2019d take while working, if so, I\u2019m wondering how long on average most full time workers are taking to complete their diplomas if the credit requirement is so high. \n\nIf you comment, please include which diploma program you completed and how long it took you please! :) \n\nEdit: *I have a Bachelors of Science from UBC. \n\nThank you for any insight you can provide, as an alternative I was debating completing the Associate Certificate as it\u2019s only 22 credits for completion; however, I would prefer an more in-depth education.",

            "comment": "BCIT credits aren't the same as UBC credits. You need to look at the number of courses required. Usually BCIT diplomas are 30 courses. BCIT has a lot of courses required per term. Most of the diplomas in other provinces would be considered advanced diploma / 3 year programs to get the equivalent education from BCIT. \n\n2 courses per term, 3 terms per year means 6 courses. I guess that would take you 5 years part-time if all of your courses line up correctly. \n\nThere is some advanced diploma program for graduates of other programs that would then ladder into the BBA program.

I've been looking at going back and taking some additional programs part-time, but the way BCIT is structured just makes it so difficult. I'm not sure your exact goals, but I'm not sure I would actually recommend BCIT for part-time credentials.",

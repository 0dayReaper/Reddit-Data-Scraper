    "postText": "I'll be starting the Accounting Diploma FT in Fall 2022, and I'll be a first year. To anyone that has studied in this particular program or just at BCIT, how difficult would it be to balance out work and school? If I got a PT job and worked Friday night and the weekends, would it be difficult to try to do this along w the FT Accounting schedule?",

Two of my classmates started our program (mechatronics and robotics) while working on Saturdays, but within 2 months both quit work due to the increased demands of studying and completing assignments.\n\nEdit: the robotics program is particularly heavy: 30 and 31 credit hours for the first year; 31 and 40 credit hours for the second year.",

You\u2019d probably be able to get away with once a week, maybe twice if you\u2019re really on top of stuff. Also depends on how hard you work in school, and your devotion to social/personal time. I slacked off towards the end of the program and my grades weren\u2019t as great as they could have been. Assess the priorities in your life and work hours accordingly. I\u2019d say a good balance would be one shift a week so you have time to everything else. Just gotta make sure you study.",

Some of the FT instructors can be kind of shitty too, so if you can take courses with a reputable PT instructor it could be worth it. If you were to take one or two in the summer I\u2019d try to take FA or Tax.",

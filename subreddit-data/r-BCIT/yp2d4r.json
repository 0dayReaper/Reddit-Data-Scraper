    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI will be moving to Vancouver soon to start at BCIT for nursing! Currently my plans are to move to a basement-ish apartment in Strathcona near Chinatown. The most recent thread I could find about living in Strathcona came from 8 years ago, so I thought I would make a post and ask again! What is it like to live in Strathcona? How is the commute to BCIT?",

Strathcona is close to the crossing of main and hastings which is infamous for having a concentrated amount of drug users and homeless people outside.\n\nI have lived in Metro Vancouver all my life and the only time I have had my window smashed was when I had my car parked outside of Strathcona Elementary school during the day.",

I looked up the neighborhood  on Google maps and it seems quite nice, and a good distance from DTES. \nMy fianc\u00e9 is going to UBC. We wanted to look for someplace that was split in between and also not too far from downtown, hence not renting at the locations you mentioned. Plus the current place I\u2019m looking at is a great deal!",

Broadway and Commercial is a great transit hub that would make it easy for both of you to get to school plus tons of shops and services in the area. Strathcona you might find pretty sketchy if you aren't used to that type of area. Chinatown is pretty run down. If you want access to Chinese shops/services I would suggest near Metrotown, check out Crystal Mall. I'd suggest Richmond but getting to BCIT from there is a beeyotch.",

Overall pretty good neighborly vibes and easy access to everything, even from public transit. I regularly walk by myself at night and feel safe, but I stay aware of my surroundings. With close proximity to Chinatown you'll have lots of options for great food/going out and groceries etc.",

There are parts of the neighborhood that look nice and have a great community vibe, but proximity to DTES is a negative. I would recommend going in advance to check out the area on foot &amp; see what you think then.",

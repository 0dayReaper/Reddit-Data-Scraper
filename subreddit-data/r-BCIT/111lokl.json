If you have at least some artistic background (i.e., drawing/painting) and an idea of how to find work, I would find a cracked copy of Adobe CS6 and lean hard into YouTube tutorials using the [program outline](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/graphic-design-certificate-full-time-part-time-6585cert/#courses) as a kind of guide.\n\nThat said, some people benefit greatly from a structured learning environment. If you have the time and money, why not?",

Offer it for free or for a small cost. Then have a case in your portfolio. This builds experience, and also networking because they are likely to refer you to their connections. Networking is VERY important, you need to be surrounded by business ppl if you want to succeed on getting clients. If you want an actual job, this will also help you by adding value to your portfolio and experience.",

It helped me by allowing me to tap in resources I was not aware of before and understanding the some of the basic principles.   \n\nIs it useful? yes, but I dont know if you'd really need to spend a couple years to get the certificate.  I've heard many good things about BCIT programs and wished I attended there instead of UBC so I would learn more hands-on stuff.  In terms of learning Adobe and all the technical stuff, I learned them all either from jobs or on my own spare times.  I already knew PS, picked up Illustrator on my 2nd job, and InDesign on my 3rd job.  It definitely takes time.  \n\nBefore I got in the working field I had to build my portfolio and not having gone through schooling I really had to showcase a lot of other designs I did, either free designs for church, clubs, or just even mock up events that exists only in your head or branding projects for companies that do not exist.  \n\nIf you are self motivated and a good learner, you probably dont need it, but if not then sure.  If you are looking to do school just for the hack of it, I would actually recommend you do marketing or communications instead because that would open up a lot of other avenues.  A lot of marketing jobs are do-it-all.   Meaning that they expect you to do graphic designs and other crap.  Whereas if you are a graphic designer they wouldn't expect you to do too much marketing.  And that would limit a lot of opportunities out there.\n\nHope that helps.",

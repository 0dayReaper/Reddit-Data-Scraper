    "postText": "The general advice given is do CST if you want to do software and CIT if you want to do IT, but let's compare the two curriculums:\n\n**Term 1:**\n\n|CST|CIT|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Business comm 1|Business comm 1|same|\n|Applied math|Technical Math|Same subjects|\n|Programming methods|Scripting for IT|Same subjects|\n|Web dev 1|Fundamental Web tech|same|\n|Business analysis|Organizational behaviour|CIT has biz anal in term 2|\n|Projects course|Database systems|Both cover nosql and crud|\n|CST fundamentals (guide to success in cst)|intro to sys admin|sys admin is an actual course so CIT wins term 1|\n\n**Term 2**\n\n|CST|CIT|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Business comm 2|Business comm 2|same|\n|Discrete math|statistics|cst will cover stats later|\n|Object oriented programming|Object oriented programming|same|\n|Procedural programming|Linux sys admin|Different!!|\n|relational database|enterprise networking|Different!!|\n|Comp architecture|UI/UX|Different|\n|n/a|Legal and eithical issues|CST will cover law later|\n|Web dev 2|Developing web applications|Same|\n|n/a|Business analysis|CST did biz anal in term 1|\n|Projects 2|Agile dev project|Same.  I give term 2 a tie.|\n\n**Term 3**\n\n|CST|CIT|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|OOP 2|Windows server admin|OOP2 is really important for software, windows server admin is specific to IT|\n|Mobile Dev|Web server admin|I'd prefer learning web server admin over mobile dev for software devs|\n|Data Comn|Cloud computing|CIT had networking in term 2, and more in term 4.  Cloud computing is a major shift in the industry right now, so it's also something software devs might want.|\n|Algorithms|Algorithms|same|\n|Statistics|Project management|CIT had stats in term 2|\n|Options course 1|Database admin|Often software devs have to interact with a db, so also useful for cst students to know.|\n|n/a|It project|Cst's term 3 will vary depending on if you get into a good option, but CIT definitely wins term 3 in terms of core courses.|\n\n**Term 4**\n\n|Software architecture|IT infastructure|IT infastructure involes docker and kubernetes, while the software architectureis making a RESTful app|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Operating systems|Service based architecture|I don't know why an IT diploma has a course on microservices, this is definitely a software dev topic.  I do think operating systems is really important|\n|Ethics|Security|CIT had ethics in term 2, but it also learns security|\n|Option course 2|IT system provisioning||\n|Option course 3|Enterprise system Integration|How to make CI/CD pipelines (This is also a software dev topic, not IT)|\n|Practicum|Data analytics|Lots of jobs involve analyzing data, also something you'd expect in cst.|\n||Practicum|CIT wins term 4 by a large margin|\n\nCIT has a surprising amount of software in it.  It seems to be a \u201cdevops\u201d program.  CST has a lot of option courses, which can vary the experience a lot.  But it is very focused on software.\n\nCIT learns CI/CD, cloud computing, security, and networking, all of which are important for software devs.\n\nCST has more discrete math, operating systems, and mobile dev.",

So far the languages/scripts that we have looked at in class in order are:\n\nPython (started with basics in term 1, then classes/websites/video games in term 2 , then advanced algorithms in term 3 with it), HTML, MSSQL, CSS, JavaScript (then branched into node, typescript, react, express in term 2), Bash, R, some powershell with AD DS, MySQL, we even did a little php in web admin term 3 though that class was mostly writing nginx server files.\n\nI would say about 1/3 is server admin and cyber security, 1/3 is pure coding, and 1/3 is everything else like writing documentation, UI/UX, and large team projects.",

    "postText": "I registered for courses today for a part time program and it's sort of unclear to me what days during the week and what times these courses happen? OR is it that online course lectures happen whenever I choose, as in \"canned\" lectures that I take whenever fits my schedule?\n\nCurrently, for \"Times/Day\" on each course it says \"N/A\". I'm looking for part time work and it would be useful to have this information for a prospective employer. I've asked my department/advising, but need clarity on this by tomorrow morning unfortunately.",

Sometimes they have prerecorded lectures though. You will get a course outline at the start of the class or you can look at the last term's (this term) course outline to get an idea.",

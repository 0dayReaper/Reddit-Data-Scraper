Amazon Fire?\n\nI am starting a new program(MLS) next week and I've heard many programs don't use paper textbooks anymore.\n\nI only own a laptop but now think I might need to buy a tablet PC as some friends of mine strongly recommended so. \n\nWhat type of tablets do you guys use?\nDo you consider a tablet PC necessary?\n\nThank you!",

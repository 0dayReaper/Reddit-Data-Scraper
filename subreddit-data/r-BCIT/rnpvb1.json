BCIT is usually acting based on what the government says... so if Bonnie says close the schools they will. Personally I believe there will be another lockdown... the federal/provincial government just enacted a new covid relief form for workers who can't work (up to $300 net per week).. there's also a $10K covid relief grant for business that need to shutdown... sounds like the government is easing its way into another lockdown, but they're trying to set things up before they do it (my speculation). To answer your question, it's too early to know for sure, but looking at other factors, chances are very likely.",

Imagine the liability and news coverage if all of the universities went remote but BCIT stayed in person. All it takes is 1 outbreak and 1 viral news article and some people might be losing their jobs.\n\n2 years into COVID and people are still not learning how to manage this. Guess all those faculties with PhDs don\u2019t mean much. Specially if your in CST, lots of staff have changed too, now they just hiring whoever has a PhD regardless if they can comprehend basic English or teach. Sadly some of the better profs have either moved to better positions or retired. Consider UBC or SFU. BCIT is just getting worse and worse with the new people getting hired.",

If youre just sitting on a high position following orders then who are you really leading? You should be planning like the students were your own children. 21k new cases nation wide and Kathy still following orders? For a school that emphasizes and teaches safety this is jus pure stupidity. Its like there\u2019s a fire and the alarms went off but nope you\u2019re like I\u2019ll jus wait until my supervisor comes to tell me it\u2019s not a false alarm. \nAnd another dum thing is this school has 0 consistency, imagine having CST and CIT both being about tech learning super similar topics. Then 1 being in person delivery (CST) and the other blended (CIT). At the end of the day it\u2019s not even about legality it\u2019s more about the preference of the dean for that program. I think right now the dean for CST stepped down or something and this useless replacement Aaron Hunter or something took over. Heard so many friends vent about that guy. Literally does jack squat. Has a PhD, can\u2019t teach can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s really jus a bad time to be a student at BCIT right now with the current management in place.",

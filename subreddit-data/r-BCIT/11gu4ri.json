Co-op has opportunities to get interesting job titles, but mostly help desk/IT support. Not enough coding courses for the program from one of the instructors' perspective. \n\nMy end goal is to get a senior position in System Administration or a role leading a team (which may lead me to obtaining a Master's if I don't change my goals). Short term goal is to get passed Help-desk positions and get a junior position in System Administration, something along those lines.\n\nAnother note, people may find the courses overwhelming and it can be at times. But its manageable imo. Definitely put your most effort in the first two terms if co-op is something you desire. \n\nJust practise python and javascript and maybe bash scripting and rest you have time go learn from the program itself. \n\nNote: if you really have a passion for coding, CST is the program you want.\n\nAnother note: lots of people who have previous university experiences or previous degrees, thats why age can be higher and range from 18-35.",

Reddit is obsessed with coding and getting a job as a code monkey and avoiding talking to people.  You\u2019d find me on the sales team cold calling all day before you\u2019ll find me doing that. \n\nThe power of Coding its a tool to build a start up and that\u2019s it with a go to market strategy- most coders want nothing to do with building a business or ideas.  They want to code and get paid for that.  Beyond tech entrepreneurship why would I want to screw code into a computer all day?  That has all the appeal of putting nails into wood as a carpenter at someone else\u2019s company for me.  This doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to code- but it\u2019s a means to an end.\n\nI probably have different goals than most students here and it\u2019s based on experience. \n\nI honestly have a passion for business- discovered in my role at an MSP as a project manager and more so an account manager.  I was also in territory sales at a national VAR but I\u2019m not quite technical enough and cold calling for software licensing seems a bit juvenile (plus I\u2019m going crazy sitting at home) \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed being an IT consultant for SMBs coming up with on prem and hybrid solutions with cross functional teams including SMEs and solution architects, aligning It solutions with their broader business objectives- as well as outlining technology strategy for the organization.  I hated dealing with SLAs for helpdesk and missed tickets.  I enjoy talking to C level and executives and having meaningful conversations about technology that impacts the business.  I don\u2019t really want to be in an internal facing positions within an organization in a support role.  Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s in IT or Ops\nManagement. \n\nWhat I hated was my own personal knowledge gaps.  Based on feedback from SAs- data centre I was told I\u2019ll always get out in front of clients, as I\u2019m personable as fuck and outgoing regardless of what I want.  I was also told by them and a CIO of a large national construction company that I need to \u201clearn the technology\u201d.\n\nMy goal is to get knowledgeable enough to get into IT consulting, and I\u2019ll probably seek technical sales roles following the program- as an extrovert it\u2019s a waste to not have my client facing bridging the gap between business and technology and ensuring customer success with their business technology.   Im also interested in cloud architecture such as AWS tracks and cloud consulting. \n\nAn IT program provides me structure as I have raging ADHD and need a social atomposhere to be effective- I won\u2019t get crap done at home. \n\nIm too lazy to do a BCom in IT or technology  management at this age as it feels like overkill given my additional curses in marketing, sales and economics., even though that\u2019s probably what I should have done.  And I don\u2019t know if the BITMAN program will give enough punching power.\n\nI\u2019m also looking at 2 year programs at Ontario colleges and SAIT.",

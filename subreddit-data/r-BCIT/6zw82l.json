    "postText": "This post is my unsolicited advice for everyone ramping up for an intense year at BCIT. If you are new to this school, buckle up. Many find the workload very intense, but it is always manageable.  \n\nFirst, a short bio for the purpose of this post:\nI graduated from the B.Eng Electrical program a few years back. It was four insanely busy years of my life which shaped my character for better and worse. I am a high-achiever. To me, that means I put my achievements first even to the detriment of my entire self and sometimes those around me. Of course, I didn't really see that at the time when I was studying and churning out report after report after report. I am pretty good at time management and learning new material. I am pretty bad a managing expectations and not obsessing over small details and utter perfection of reports and code. (Fuck you c++, I love you, but fuck you.) \n\nIt wasn't until after graduation that I really felt the full impact of my habits. It wasn't until after graduation that I realized I had sacrificed my mental health for numbers on piece of paper (and still, my ego loves these numbers but they were not worth the cost). Rather than decompress and move on with life after graduation, I began suffering panic attacks. Life was good. Life is great. But, the general anxieties which I had conquered prior to BCIT were back and more fierce than ever. It took me a few years to really get back on track. \n\nI would like to share a few pieces of advice I would give to myself if I had a time machine. I do not believe hindsight is 20/20 and it is far too easy for me to postulate on what I could have done better. For that reason I am limiting my advice to those things that I have consciously practiced moving forward from my time at BCIT.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n1) Meditate! No joke. It doesn't take much time each day. This time spent doing next-to-nothing will have a positive impact on all aspects of your life. I just completed 1000 hours over 75 days (less than 15 minutes per day, average) using the Headspace app. There are many apps out there which I have tried and this one was worth the $60 or $70 I spent for the year (first 10 days are free to try). Omvana is good too. (In Omvana, the Envisioning Method is free, 15 minutes, and pretty good. In fact, it may be great for sorting out goals at school and managing the day-to-day routine. Head over to r/meditation and read up on the various techniques, books and apps. Actually don't, your at BCIT and have no time for Reddit, haha. Just dive in with one of these apps and stop wasting time :). Do this every day before leaving for school. You do have the time for this! \n\n2) Seek Council. The counselors at BCIT are great and FREE. I saw Judith after going through a major breakup of a 6 year relationship (partially due to my absence and shitty prioritization of school work) and I saw Kurt to help manage presentation anxieties. I don't know if they're still around, but the counselors are top notch professionals who can help manage your mental health. My regret is not following up and talking to them about work loads and expectations. If anyone is qualified and experienced to counsel students on managing work-life balance, it is the BCIT counselors. Now I see a counselor when my anxiety piques, but the meditation has kept me on track for over four months. \n\n3) Exercise. If you are into sports, you probably don't need this advice. If you are saturated by the work load already, you may be wishing me to fuck right off as your time is limited. It is worth it. I started running a couple days per week in my last year and it definitely did reduce the impact of stress. It didn't take much. If I were to do it all again, I would join a recreational sport team at the school to keep my routine in check. I did play ad-league softball, but I ended up bailing a lot due to school priorities. Since your already at school, taking 1hr a couple times each week to play a game is good for the body and mind. I mean, you already take unintentional 1hr Reddit breaks, amIright?  \n\n4) Stay social. Your friends will accept you are at BCIT and will not see them often. Just don't forget to take a few minutes every now and then to check in. Don't be afraid to bail early from parties rather than avoid them all together. You probably all know this one though...\n\n\nI hope some of this helps you in your studies. If you take anything away, go with number one. Seriously, meditation seems like a dumb waste of time until you get into it and realize the immense benefits of mindfulness!\n\nGood luck to all of you in your studies, in life, and in your future career (which you will actually have because you chose BCIT). You got this!\n\n\nTL;DR. Be kind to your mind. Meditate every day for 10 to 20 minutes (seriously, just do it). Don't be shy of counselors. Move your body now and then. \n\n",

            "comment": "I graduated from the Mech Eng program a few years back. One thing I've noticed is that BCIT prepares you TOO well for work. As in, you spend all this time studying and working your ass off and by the fourth year you sort of get used to it. Your mind actually starts to crave that influx of new material to learn. When you get a job, it is WAY easier than going to BCIT and studying. Depending on your job, you may not get that kind of stimulation that BCIT provided you with. Your mind craves it still but it isn't used to the boredom and monotony of some jobs. \n\nIn a way, we put in all this extra effort that you'd expect from a school like MIT or some other prestigious school and we get hired for less than interesting jobs. You get so used to the work schedule at school that you have trouble being satisfied with work.\n\nIt's like you start playing with blocks when your young. As you get smarter, you upgrade to playing with a rubiks cube, then you play sudoku, then you learn how to play computer games. Then at the end, they take away your computer games and give you blocks to play with all day. ",

I am taking it maturely, but man does it bog me down when I think about what could have been had I not got sick or spent *just* a bit more time on assignments. Sometimes it just kills me to think this could even happen.\n\n\nOh well, I guess all happens for a reason, I ended up in having an internship at an engineering company for 4 months and now joined a pretty good company that pays pretty well.....",

                    "comment": "Hey, good questions.\n\n**- Quality of instructors:** definitely varied. Most were very dedicated and motivated to make the learning experience good for us, but (like any post secondary institution) there were a handful, maybe 1-2 per semester, who seemed uninterested in the topic at hand. When in a class with one of these instructors you really learn to depend on your setmates to help each other learn.\n\n**- Industry projects:** I only participated in 1 of these \"ISSP\" courses (during my 3rd term right before 8 month co-op period) and it was tough to say the least. We had a decently interesting project assigned to us that would be used live in production by the sponsor of the project, but the difficulty is that you cannot choose your group teammates. We were stuck with a few (for lack of better word) duds in our group of 6. Only 3 of us were attentive and did any work, which made it a very frustrating project. All that said, it was helpful to have on a resume and gave me a little something extra to talk about during interviews.\n\n**- Did it prepare me for the workforce:** honestly, hard to say. My job currently is in software development, which CIT does not touch much (you could count the number of programming classes on one hand), so in that regard it was my own free time learning that helped more. CIT helped me most with the communications courses and interpersonal skills given through working in many groups which were the most helpful when transitioning to work force. I think your mileage may vary here, folks who are working in DevOps now are likely to feel as if CIT gave them more tools for their job than SE.\n\nHope these help - let me know if you want more clairification",

                    "comment": "Hey, thanks for the questions.\n\n**- What does your job entail:** it is a remote software development position. I work in a team of about 10 devs (same team I worked on during co-op :)) in a financial/bill payments department of the company. We are currently in the middle of a huge new project so the tasks are pretty fun and exciting to work on - but there are definitely still the boring tasks to do occasionally - no matter if you're an intern, dev, staff dev or even higher :p\n\n**- What is day to day like:** for the most part I work solo by choice, but my team is all about pair programming, so I try to do an hour per day of that - it really helps me process the problems better and learn about the code from more experienced people at the company.\n\n**- How many exempt courses are you allowed to have before applying to co-op:** I'm not sure... probably best to not have any. You can always chat with the co-op coordinators, they're great. Email probably on the website somewhere!\n\n**- Is CIT \"chill\" or is the workload no piece of cake:** this definitely varies! CIT is designed for someone to be able to come in with no prior experience (ie: concepts are explained in immense details but really quickly). For people in this boat it is really challenging - especially the first 2 semesters. Work piles on really quick and the fundamentals of stuff are explained really quickly so you are expected to pick stuff up quickly. For those who have some prior experience in any of the main topics then the workload is much less, maybe even \"chill\" :p. The first 2 semesters are the hardest for sure no matter what, and the last 2 become much easier and less intense.",

The required average for our group was about 83% I think (they take the top 20 people in all 3 sets, and our average was about that).",

That said, most of my friends who are working now are doing DevOps focused stuff, with a few in helpdesk positions and programming positions.\n\n**- Is software development a possibility:** yes! One nice thing about the hiring market currently is that most places don't really care where you got your degree/diploma - even less so which specific program you did there. This means you can do a more DevOps focused program like CIT and still be able to get into software development. My biggest recommendation for people wanting to do software development out of CIT is to build a nice portfolio of personal projects online, like on your GitHub. It really sets you apart from others during interviews.",

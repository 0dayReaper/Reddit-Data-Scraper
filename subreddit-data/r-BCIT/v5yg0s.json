    "postText": "Context for my situation:\n\nI currently hold a Bachelor's Degree in Business Admin from SFU, and there isn't anything in the field that I can get into aside from basic admin jobs since that's what my background is in. I have some experience with business analysis but not much. \n\nI'm currently on track to finish the Business Analytics graduate certificate but I'm extremely disappointed in the program and it was genuinely a waste of money (my cohort seems to agree from word-of-mouth), plus, it seems like all the computer science students and graduates are taking these jobs.\n\nI am just wondering if the CIT program is worth entering and what the job market looks like for more recent graduates. I've been grinding away at re-learning Python and doing the Odin Project so I can learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Ruby while I'm currently unemployed due to personal circumstances. \n\nI'm interested in things like web development (Front-end or full-stack preferably), and UX design. While I understand that BCIT has paid programs for things like this on its own, I think a proper full time diploma would be more beneficial in opening more doors up for me (plus, the Business Analytics program kind of left a bad taste in my mouth). \n\nCan anyone give me some insight from their experiences? Hopefully recent graduates or current students.",

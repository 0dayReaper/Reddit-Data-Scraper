He told me only Math and English Marks matter furthermore the Tech Entry is a bit of a mess right now.  people who wanted to apply coming the coming January and not being able to submit Midterm marks. I was told this is also the case for the Spring term. Also Tech Entry has a lot of filler courses like Ntry0301 which adds to your work load. Unless your over 35 years old and struggle with basic technology, I recommend you upgrading your Math and English at a college or local school district it's free.",

They\u2019ll just retract you math 12,physics 12, Chem 12, etc. Just go on Khan academy and study extensively the materials. CST is not hard to get into if ur average meets 80%+",

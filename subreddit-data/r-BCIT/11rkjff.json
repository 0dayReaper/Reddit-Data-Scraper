The refund amount depends on your income tax based on your final income and what was deducted at source or paid earlier. Given you were full time student, you get non refundable tuition credits. Along with this there is another credit called canada training limit which is refundable. Its hard for me to say without having total numbers and scenarios in front of me. But if the amounts in post are the only amounts you received from your school and government, the line 13010 should not have anything on it.",

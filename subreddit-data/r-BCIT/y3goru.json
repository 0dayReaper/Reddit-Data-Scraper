I have a bachelors degree but its quite niche and haven't made use of it since I graduated, not sure there is much to build on that specifically.\n\nI'm in dire need of a credentials that can get me a job/career or at least in the right direction, and I'm very open minded as to what this could be. Any suggestions welcome, going to see if advising can help me out here as well\n\nCheers",

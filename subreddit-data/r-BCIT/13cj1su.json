    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m an incoming international student, and am planning to get PGWP once I complete the CST program.\n\nApparently you can get up to 3 years of PGWP, but only if your program is 2 years or longer.\n\nBut from what I noticed, CST is actually 2 years and 4 months if you get into the co-op program. But only 1 year 9 months and 1 week if you don\u2019t get into the co-op program.\n\nSo I\u2019d like to ask if you can still get the 3-year-PGWP even if you didn\u2019t get into the co-op program? Anyone been through this or heard someone who has?",

But one of my friend got 3 years PGWP with taking 2-year diploma which actually lasted around 22 months. I\u2019m not an expert of this though. You can contact BCIT for the right answer!",

    "postText": "Architectural and Building Technology (ABT) \n\nSEMESTER 1 OVERVIEW SEPT 6- DEC 9, 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone, so I just finished the first semester and thought it would be nice to give an overview of what the semester is like. \n\nI am guessing you have seen the course schedule and be overwhelmed by the number of courses, but let me assure you that it is definitely doable. TIME MANAGEMENT IS ABOSOLUTE. I have never felt the need to sacrifice sleep to complete study, but there are students who have, so its up to you. \n\nHeads up:\n\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t expect every assignment to be due to at midnight, a lot of them are due in the morning.\n\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t expect help form professors because some professors you might only see twice a week but do get help whenever you can (office hours).\n\n\u2022\tAbsolutely must not leave assignments last minute, THEY WILL PILE UP, you will have to sacrifice some other wise\n\n\u2022\tHaving a writable tablet is a plus but does not affect performance at all\n\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t get many handouts so no need to bring a binder\n\n\u2022\tYou will need to print 11x17 paper and the printer will run out of paper since everyone is printing  last minute, so pace yourself.\n\n\u2022\tSupplies for BLDG 1000 isn\u2019t much just buy it slowly to see what you need\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClasses: \n\nBLDG 1000 Elements of Graphic Communication - Professor: Katie Henderson \n\n\u2022\tNice professor will help you when she can (there are around 35 students in the classroom)\n\n\u2022\tOnly see her once per week, and some assignments are due next week so you only see once to   get help (unless office hours)\n\n\u2022\tLecture notes and info are scattered so take notes of what the assignment requires\n\n\u2022\tAttention to detail is important, will take time, so adjust time accordingly.\n\n\u2022\tLarge term project that is also the term project for BLDG 1405. WORTH 50%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBLDG 1050 Construction Materials/Processes 1 - Professor: Arezou Pouria/katie henderson\n\n\u2022\tProfessors got switched mid-semester, arezou first half (I will focus on arezou)\n\n\u2022\tShe\u2019s a nice person but her methods of teaching are lacking\n\n\u2022\tShe tends to read off the lecture slides which makes it easy to doze off (hard to focus)\n\n\u2022\tEasy class to pass\n\n\u2022\tsite plan project- with a team of 4, you each go visit a construction project and write a report, choose your partners wisely this project also applies to COMM 1140\n\n\u2022\texam was open book, but that may change so be prepared\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBLDG 1200 Building Construction 1 - Professor: Trevor Emery\n\n\u2022\tchill guy but his content is a lot and really REALLY easy to fall behind\n\n\u2022\thas the longest lecture and long labs\n\n\u2022\tshould pay attention is lecture and lab\n\n\u2022\this labs will use up most of your time so use his lab time wisely\n\n\u2022\tyou will be doing AutoCAD 100% of the time during lab, so buy a mouse\n\n\u2022\texam was open book, but that may change so be prepared\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBLDG 1405 Architectural CAD 1 - Professor: Paul Rodham\n\n\u2022\tchill and interesting guy, talks about his cats\n\n\u2022\tnot many assignments in his class, EASY STUFF. PAY ATTENTIO TO DETAIL\n\n\u2022\tLARGE TERM PROJECT WORTH 50%\n\n\u2022\tTAKE NOTES OF WHAT HE SAYS (IS GOING TO BE ON EXAM)\n\n\u2022\tWILL ONLY SEE HIM ONCE PER WEEK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBLDG 1600 Structures 1 for Building - Professor: Aiman Mustafa\n\n\u2022\tNice guy but goes through content without much explanation of how we got here (may differ for                      you)\n\n\u2022\t2 main assignments, you need 100% on this. May save you at the end\n\n\u2022\tNeed to put in extra time in to understand\n\n\u2022\tExams are what he taught, so no surprise, but hard to understand concepts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPHYS 1140 Applied Physics for Building 1 - Professor: Kenneth Mark\n\n\u2022\tComes off as a nice guy but I don\u2019t know what he is thinking about\n\n\u2022\tLectures are hard to focus because he teaches a bit slowly\n\n\u2022\tTakes 1 lecture to cover a sample question\n\n\u2022\tDoes not have good time management\n\n\u2022\tExams questions are all multiple choice but only provides 1 sample exam per exam.\n\n\u2022\tLabs are only worth 5-8% despite the time spent on them\n\n\u2022\tMust buy mastering physics with is $130, which most students just cheat. \n\n\u2022\tTakes over a week to mark exams despite using scantrons. \n\n\u2022\tWe had enough time to cover the material, but his pacing is not good\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH 1401 Technical Mathematics for ABT- Professor: Simin Sadat Chavoshi Jolfaee\n\n\u2022\tSo far, the chilliest professor\n\n\u2022\tNeed to buy mobius $35ish and notes book ($15), worth it in my opinion\n\n\u2022\tExams questions are what she teaches and provides a lot of opportunities to earn extra marks\n\n\u2022\tWeekly quizzes but easy to 100% on 90 percent of them\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCOMM 1140 Technical Communication 1 for Building - Professor: Andrea Matthews\n\n\u2022\tNice professor and easy class\n\n\u2022\tMainly about writing professional emails\n\n\u2022\tNeed to give one presentation but its easy\n\n\u2022\tExams are writing emails\n\n\u2022\tOne term project with BLDG 1050\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClass difficulty (relative):\n\nBLDG 1600 &gt; PHYS 1140 &gt; BLDG 1000 &gt; BLDG 1200 &gt; MATH 1401 &gt; BLDG 1050 &gt; BLDG 1405 &gt; COMM 1140\n\nExtra bit:\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the first semester, there are things I would do differently of course, but then again life happens, and you just got to deal with it. Find your strengths and weaknesses and put time where it is needed.\n\nThe exam schedule was brutal for me, 6 exams in 4 days. You need to know what takes priority and stay on track.\n\nGood luck to anyone coming.\n\nLet me know if I need to add anything.",

Mainly just the last month where the workload started to build but overall it was VERY manageable. I think it should be said aswell that reading for 1050 is not necessary at all, or well for any of the classes I didn\u2019t find it necessary and more of a waste of time.",

            "comment": "id also add that although some of the exams are open book dont expect to go into the exam without studying at all and get a good grade. Although you might not need to know everything down to the last detail, you need to have a good general outlook on the content so that you know where to look. Easeist to make on big pdf of all the lecture slides then to use your own notes, thats if you take any.",

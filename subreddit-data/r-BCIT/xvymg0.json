    "postText": "Hello! I'm having a hard time finding information about admission to the perfusionist program at BCIT. I'm aware it's a highly competitive program with very limited seats (15-20?). I've also heard of healthcare workers being denied admission even with many years of critical care experience. My question is how does one get in? My personal situation is that I graduated with a BA and am now in my last year of RT school. I'm looking to apply down the road but want to be realistic about whether I'd be considered. For the students and/or graduates of this program what was your background, experiences, grades, certifications, etc.? Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks :)",

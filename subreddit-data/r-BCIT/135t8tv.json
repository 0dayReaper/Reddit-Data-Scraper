    "postText": "Hey! \n\nCurrently I'm in grade 11, and not quite sure where I wanted to go. I'm skilled with metal working and welding, but it isn't my passion and I don't think I want to do it as a job.\n\nI was wondering about job prospects for the natural forests and land management program that bcit has, and how hard it is to get in. I know that it's a hard course, but what grades do I really need to get in? is there anything I can do in the summer to help improve my chances when I apply to get in?\n\nWould the degree you get from the program translate into the states? Could I get my degree then potentially move to the states and find work in the field? I know I don't want to go into an office job with my degree, what would field work entail? \n\nThank you guys in advance, I was hoping to get some personal experience.",

The entire forest industry in BC needs skilled workers, and BCIT is known for producing skilled grads. \nThe requirements are pretty basic, and they start taking applications about a year before the program starts\u2026apply as soon as they open applications\u2026that\u2019s the only sure fire way to guarantee entrance\u2026like I\u2019m talking if they start accepting applications at 9am on Wednesday, have your application in by 9:02am. Just get everything you need ready to go before hand. \nBecause it\u2019s BCIT the first semester is a nightmare. Like 9 classes\u2026projects, exams, assignments all the time. If you make it to the second semester, it\u2019s a bit easier with 8 classes. Second year is a lot more chill. \nI\u2019m not sure about the states\u2026I\u2019m gonna guess that each state has its own rules, but I can\u2019t see why they would accept it. Best option would be to look into where you want to go specifically and check their requirements.\nIf you want to chat more PM me. I just finished the first year of the program.",

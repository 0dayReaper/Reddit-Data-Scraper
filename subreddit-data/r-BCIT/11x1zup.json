Since BCIT doest offer the usual courses such as Org Chem, etc, would I need to take other courses alongside my degree to meet the requirements for med school, specifically in Canada?",

I'm dealing with this issue now, not for nursing but for another program.\n\nThen you'd have to have at least 90 credits I think to apply to med school - might change per school. \n\nNursing might have more transferable courses than I do, so I'm not sure.",

It is a harder route to choose than some of the other traditional degrees. Some schools require pre-reqs, however UBC med ONLY requires a second year English course as a pre-req. Your best chances will be at UBC med. Another thing is in regard to the comment that \u201cbarely any nurses get in to UBC.\u201d We don\u2019t actually know what percentage of nurses apply and those that get in. Nurses get into medical school all the time. It\u2019s the diversity of their experiences, research experience, and grades that matter. Not the degree. It\u2019s a non-trad route but it\u2019s solid in my opinion as a nurse making the same jump. There are several doctors and surgeons in BC that I have worked with who were nurses before they entered med school.",

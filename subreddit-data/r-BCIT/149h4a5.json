    "postText": "Hey all.\n\nI\u2019m starting this program this upcoming semester beginning in September and was wondering how far behind will I be compared to others with me since I don\u2019t have any experience working on vehicles and large equipment at that. At most I\u2019m able to do oil changes and wheel swaps but that\u2019s about it without tutorials. I\u2019m willing to learn and really want to go through with this. \nDoes the foundation program teach from the very basics like how to use hand tools properly etc.\n\nAlso will I have enough time to atleast work part time?\n\nThanks",

That\u2019s the whole point of the foundation program is to get you ready for the trade. It used to be called a pre-app or something. Obviously working on the stuff before or knowing the parts is a huge advantage but no prior knowledge was needed. And we did a lot of shop time for teaching the proper use of tools and what not. Not sure if the heavy equipment will be the same but BCIT seems to have decent shops for every program.",

It\u2019s more of a if you feel like you need more time possibly scale back on the working hours and focus to your studies. This is going to be your future career so put the effort in now and you will thank your future self when you\u2019re on the job.",

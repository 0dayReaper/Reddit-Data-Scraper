While pandemic I was struggled a lot so I have been taking gap year Since 2021.\n\nI want to be a electrician in my future but I am not sure which curriculum I should go. I heard people start with electrical foundation and move on to apprentice level. \n\nWhich course should I apply if I do not have any electrician experience and How can I apply? \nHow long does it take to join a class and when people usually start course? \n\nThank you so much for read and it would be amazing to answer some of my questions.",

            "comment": "Journeyman electrician here. For most people, I recommend going straight into an apprenticeship and taking level 1 trade school after about 1 year of work. This route gets you a taste of what the trade is like with minimal up-front investment. With the current labour market, finding an employer to hire you as an apprentice should be straightforward. \n\nThese documents from the Industry Training Authority might be helpful (check out the flowcharts on page 3 of each document).\n\n[https://www.itabc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/industrial-electrician-profile-april-2018-harmonized.pdf](https://www.itabc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/industrial-electrician-profile-april-2018-harmonized.pdf)\n\n[https://www.itabc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/construction-electrician-profile-april-2018-harmonized.pdf](https://www.itabc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/construction-electrician-profile-april-2018-harmonized.pdf)",

Just get into work place and 1st year apprenticeship.\nBut my concern is I literally do not have any experience. That is why I am planning to do foundation so I at least learn very Basic things.\n\nMay I get any tips or thoughts from you about this situation?\nThank you very much again!",

I found an apprenticeship before the program started and decided to go that route instead. I had no prior experience with electrical work but learned quickly on the job. In my experience with apprentices, those that come from a foundations program don't have much of an edge over those that go directly into an apprenticeship. Plus, you'll find out if the trade is a good fit for you before investing time and money into the foundations course. That's not to say that the program doesn't have value for some people, but the direct entry route worked out well for me.",

I do not know the details but he is doing super well (in 6 figure range). Best of luck, perhaps asking these question to the admission team at BCIT :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am planning to apply for the CIT fall 2023 intake.  I am curious about the coop program.  From my understanding, the school would provide a lot of positions for students to apply for when they do their coop. Do CIT students have the same options and chances to get a software developer role in a coop program, as CST students?   Also, I heard that CIT is easy than CST.  What is the failure rate in CIT?  Hope to get answers from previous and current students.  Really appreciate your answers.",

            "comment": "In case you didn't know there's a GPA cut-off for co-op (based on term 1 and 2, ranging around the mid to upper 80s) so not every student gets to be in the co-op program. Generally you will have fewer options and chances to get a software dev role in co-op compared to CST students.\n\nIn my opinion, CIT is much easier than CST. If you put an average amount of effort in and you attend office hours (if you do start falling behind), you will not come anywhere close to failing.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your answer.  You mean CIT students have fewer options and chances to get a software dev role in a coop.  Is it because Software dev positions open to CIT students are fewer than CST students, or the two cohorts have the same range to choose but employers would prefer CST students? Thanks.",

                            "comment": "It's technically one giant pool of jobs for co-op computing students but because there are more CST co-op students compared to CIT co-op students and CST is more recognized among employers, it ends up being harder for CIT co-ops to grab the software dev positions.\n\nThere's other factors that I think are in CST's favor. CST is more intensive which seems to better prepare students in having the discipline to self-study for coding interviews while studying full-time. \n\nAdditionally, the third term of CIT (when you start interviewing) doesn't have a dedicated programming course. This means you have to balance learning about Windows Server, Web Server administration, Cloud Computing, IT Project Management, Database Administration, and potentially work on minimal coding IT practicum project. This is a lot to take in all while studying LeetCode and writing cover letters. (There is an algorithms course but I don't believe it's that helpful). \n\nWhereas in the second term of CST (when they start interviewing), you at least have two dedicated programming courses (C and Java) which helps get you in the mindset for the coding interview and at the very least is less of a distraction than having to study things like Windows Server or web server administration concepts.\n\nHaving said all that, I don't want you coming away thinking it is impossible to get a software dev role as a CIT co-op student. It's definitely doable.",

It's just cit students are less well prepared to pass interviews. \n\nIn your case it sounds like the difference between not getting into coop(cst) or get into coop but less prepared(cit).  \n\nIn the first case things are much harder, the second case you have more time to fix things.  \n\nI did not get an sde job in CIT coop, I took the highest paying job.  I did become an sde after graduation and it worked out fine.",

    "postText": "BCIT CST student here, I found GPT very useful over the past semester but got sick of the price of premium. This is a link to a discord where I have implemented a bot that answers questions just like gpt premium but at a fraction of the cost. New users will get 10 free messages to see if they like it, plus the server has free image generation. To keep AI services running fast the invite will be closed after 100 new users join \n\n[https://discord.gg/acV8VKmfz2](https://discord.gg/acV8VKmfz2)\n\nplease feel free to comment or send me a message, this is a service that I would like to expand and build on in the future.",

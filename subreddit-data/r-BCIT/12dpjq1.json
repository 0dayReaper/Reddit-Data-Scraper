You have lazy coworkers ( teachers ) who just re use content and not care and skim by. Content changes every year or two as standards adjust but the real junk teachers reuse their slides / content from a decade ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf BCIT is like other post secondary institutions the prep time is a joke plus additional meetings and 'volunteering' for committees etc. etc. If you don't prep and be professional the students are the one's who suffer which is the worst feeling because you're there to help them. All of this coupled with the fact that you're also babysitting young adults who haven't had experience in the real world and abysmal parenting that bullying, hygiene etc. are an issue that you also have to get involved in the reasons to stay get shorter and shorter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine making 80k managing 30 people not getting over time. Yeah no, you can go manage 30 Adults and make 110-140k in a professional setting.",

I couldn\u2019t stand it. \nHe also was just not that good at verbal communication in general. His name is Andre Coetzee. \n\nI was surprised because I have had mostly excellent teachers so far. I feel like I really got shafted this term. \nWorst part is they wasted my time (couldn\u2019t sign up for another class that term), and took 15% of the tuition. Pretty bogus when they probably know he\u2019s a horrible instructor. \n\nHow do the rest of you avoid bad teachers? There aren\u2019t many listed on ratemyprof.com. By the time you realize you signed up for a class with a bad teacher, it\u2019s often too late to switch to a different section.",

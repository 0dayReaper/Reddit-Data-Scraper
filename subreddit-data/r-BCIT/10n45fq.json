So just make sure you have enough time to complete all courses successfully before 3 years is up.\n\n- you should talk to Rahul (current program head) and discuss with him just to confirm if it's doable.\n\n- if you're in second year, keep in mind that your options course might not have the term 4 offerings in the following term.",

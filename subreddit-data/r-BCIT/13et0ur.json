    "postText": "Hi\n\nI begin my intake for FSWD this september (My average grade was 92% ). When researching about the program I seen a lot of negative comments about FSWD and how CST was a better choice. It has made me nervous about my choice.\n\nI am switching careers but I have very minimal background in IT and have been teaching myself in preparation for this course. \n\nThe reason I chose FSWD is the curriculum seems more focus on front and back end instead of math and other things like CST. \n\nIs FSWD the wrong choice? Should I drop and try to go CST next January term? \n\nAnyone have any experience with either program?",

            "comment": "If you really like to focus on web dev then it is a good option. CST give you more career paths than FSWD, but there's no better between the two.\n\nIt really boils down to what you really want to achieve and if you have plans to get a degree.\n\nAlso, majority who goes to CST have minimal to no knowledge in programming. You study because you want to gain that knowledge.\n\nPersonally I will choose CST because I like the notion of having broader career option and an option to get into the degree program easily at BCIT. But that's me and not you.",

I know a lot of CST graduates go into web development anyways so I made the switch so I can strictly focus on web development.",

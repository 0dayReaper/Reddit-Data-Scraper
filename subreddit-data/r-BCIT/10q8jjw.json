    "postText": "Anyone here studying/graduated from the AD GIS program? I got accepted into the program but I am wondering how the practicum works... Will you be 100% guaranteed that you will get a practicum if you choose to do that (instead of the project)?\n\nAlso, a verrrry stupid question: is it hard to find an entry-level GIS job after graduation in BC? Will I still be unemployed? I would really appreciate any advice :(((",

            "comment": "current GIS student here. You are not guaranteed a practicum. We were given a list of practica and projects to apply for like they are jobs. As in, they are competitive like jobs. Projects are still industry sponsored and everything, it ends up being closer to a contractor relationship versus being the sponsor's employee. But, you will get at least one of the two. Some projects had the number of students expanded so that nobody went without anything. It's turned out to be close to a 50/50 split on everyone getting a project or practicum.",

            "comment": "Hello!  \n\n\nI'll be starting the ADP at the same time as you! See you on campus this Fall!  \n\n\nThat's also a question I was concerned about and I spoke to a lot of program staff and alums about it before I applied. You are NOT guaranteed a practicum. They are competitive, and are handled basically like job applications in that your application will be reviewed and decided by the group you're trying to work with. I think BCIT tries to promote it like there is a a practicum spot per student (or close to it), but that doesn't seem to be the case.  \n\n\nTwo other useful things I did learn, though:  \nIf you want a practicum, you don't have to apply from their list of approved ones. If you can coordinate with some organization that's willing to sponsor you for the practicum, it's possible to get that arrangement approved and overseen like one of the pre-approved ones. So that could be an option if you happen to have some connections going in.  \nAlso, it sounds like you might have an edge in practicum applications if you have a background in a field that uses GIS, but is less common among students in the program. Sounds like political science/public policy in particular is a good background to have.",

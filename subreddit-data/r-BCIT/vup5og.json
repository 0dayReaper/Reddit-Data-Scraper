    "postText": "What was your GPA when you got accepted into Medical laboratory science OR General Sonography Program?\n\nI am planning to apply for 2024 batch. I need to prepare everything by October 2023.\nI will be upgrading the Bio, physics and Maths prereq through BCIT part time courses and Chem at Douglas College.\n\nMy 12th grade exams were really good but I have done my secondary education outside Canada which would be 7 yrs old by the time of admission.\n\nI have associate of science degree(2020) (3.39 GPA) \n\nShould I take more post secondary courses to improve the GPA or just focus on acquiring volunteer experience since I don't have any",

I don\u2019t quite remember what my GPA was, but I know I got mid to high 80s (85%-89%) in bio, math, physics and English and just hit the cut off mark for chemistry (73%-75%), as well as hit the second highest quartile in the Casper test\n\nAs far as I am aware, at least for MLS, most of their decision for who gets in the program or not is based off of the MMI. The grades/GPA is mainly used to determine who gets an invite for the interview",

Ours was done online in groups of ~20 people, and it was three little quizzes that basically tests the skills needed for the profession! They may go back to the old format soon, but ours was very easy and nothing to stress about",

Pretty sure they've chosen which applicants to take based on the GPA and Casper scores prior to the MMI. They just want to check if the selected people can read and aren't visually disabled. \n\nOne question gave a picture of a duck and a flamingo and asked for the similarities and differences. Another question was putting things in alphabetical and numerical order.",

I had an average of 90% for those courses when I took them in high school. \n\nSince you have an associates degree you already have a very good chance at getting in, so if I were you, I would just focus on doing well in the courses you are upgrading as that\u2019s the main thing they look at (I didn\u2019t submit any of my post secondary grades so that\u2019s why I think they mainly look at the required/high school course marks when accepting students). Also, I believe grades are only used for the first step of the application process and then final acceptance is based on the interview. \n\nThey don\u2019t accept any volunteer experience as a part of your application either so I also wouldn\u2019t worry about that. \n\nGood luck on your application, I hope this helped!",

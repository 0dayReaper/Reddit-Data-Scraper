    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a local dentist and I would like to share something I created with my programmer friend who is a proud BCIT graduate. Since we became friends couple of years ago, we constantly shared ideas of each other\u2019s field and we came inspired to collaborate on a project.   \n \nAs a dentist, I realized a dental clinic is not everyone\u2019s favorite place to be. Many people fear the anticipation of pain or even dentists in general, and certain treatments can be quite expensive without dental benefits.  As a result, dental problems are sometimes neglected.\n\nHaving these facts in mind, we created a free self-checking tool (www.dentalchek.com) for anyone with dental problems. This tool can give an idea of what could be causing the symptoms. By providing some relevant information, we hope to reduce public\u2019s fear of dentists and teach the importance of seeking help before a problem gets worse.\n \nPlease keep in mind this tool by no means substitutes an actual visit to a dentist. I strongly recommend going to a clinic for ALL dental concerns. But if you must postpone your visit, at least learn about your symptoms to understand possible consequences of leaving the problem for later. Hopefully using this tool will encourage you to seek help and maybe even make your dental visit more pleasant with less surprises. \n \nBefore I finish off, I want to make clear the following points:\n\n* We are individuals who spent a year to make this tool ourselves. We are not part of a corporate and have no interest in marketing ourselves as individual dentist or programmer.\n\n* Dental treatments are expensive and I do understand this is unfortunately the biggest issue. The best advice I can give is to prevent problems or treat them early before they get worse. In addition, Vancouver is lucky to have a Dentistry department at UBC where its undergraduate students offer treatments at a lower price.\n\n* I am making this post on many subreddits in hopes of reaching out to as many people as possible. Regardless of region, there are always people with dental problems. I would greatly appreciate it if you guys can share this with anyone who may benefit from it.\n",

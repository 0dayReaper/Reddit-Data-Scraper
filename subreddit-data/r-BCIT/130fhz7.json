    "postText": "Hi to whoever is reading. I am a term 1 student in the cit program and I had a pretty ok term 1 where I passed all my classes. My issue is however, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get into co - op in term 2 even if I get amazing grades in term 2( iirc co op is a average of term1 and term2 grades). I been reading some posts on the bcit Reddit regarding CIT and I\u2019ve been seeing that students who did not get into co op have difficulty finding jobs. I\u2019m not sure how true this is and was hoping if a cit grad could give me a idea if this is true. I was also wondering if there\u2019s anything you can do yourself or through bcit that adds the same value as co op would to your resume. I\u2019m 18 as of right now and was thinking about doing CST instead as I may want a software dev role and it gives me another shot at co op. Is it possible to get a software dev role if your a graduate of the CIT program instead of CST. This whole thing has me really stressed out and it\u2019s hard to sleep well lately as I\u2019m so anxious that I\u2019m going to devote so much time into the program only to not be able to find a job coming out of the program. I was really hoping if I could speak to a grad or someone with insight into the CIT program. I would really appreciate it if someone like I mentioned before could spare me 5 mins of their time to just answer my questions as it would help my\nNerves a lot. Thank you all!",

But remember it's gonna be even harder than cit, harder still to get into cst co op.\n\nYou can take that route if you are more interested in program, software development. Though, CIT will also touch on this to some extent, and similar roles can be applied for after doing either program.\n\nLastly, in all honesty, sure co op gives you an edge but nothing guarantees you a job after graduation. It will highly depend on you, your resume, cover letter, interview skills, your network/contacts to land you your first job.",

I\u2019m not sure about switching into cit as one I would have to apply for the Jan 2024 Intake and I would need to do pre cal as well over the summer jus to apply. Assuming I pass term 1 and term 2 if I get accepted into cst I\u2019ll either have to finish cit or just waste the year and two terms I would have done and restart in cst.\nI\u2019m not sure if this is a good option but I honestly just want security and do something that gives me the best shot of a stable career. If that\u2019s cst the move might be worth it. Also from your knowledge do you know typically what kinda jobs non co op grads from cit can get and how would you apply for a software dev position would you need bridging classes or outside certifications if you grad from cit?",

You will be eligible if you apply to and start cst from term 1 all over again.\n\nEither options are good to get you a job dependant on the current and future job market. However cit is more IT related jobs and cst more software development / software engineer related jobs. Intermingling is possible  \n\nNon co op grads can get anything from help desk to devops to web dev. To increase chances for a software or web development job after cit you would need mainly personal projects and self learning outside of class.",

    "postText": "Hi , I\u2019m up here to ask whether I should buy the textbooks. I\u2019m gonna start school soon and I\u2019m in marketing management, but I\u2019m not sure if I should buy the textbook since I heard someone said u don\u2019t really need it for some certain subjects. Could anyone tell me for which classes I might need it and where I could get it . Thank you !",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI seek everyones advice today to make an informed decision on which university (in the Vancouver area) I will attend. I have applied to SFU, UBC, and BCIT for applied science or computer science.  I hope to get accepted into all 3 of these programs due to my 92 percent average but, I need your guys advice on which program I should accept (please try and have an un biased opinion because of your program). For SFU, I've applied for Computer Engineering, for UBC I applied for Applied Sciences, and for BCIT  I applied for Computer System Technology (hopefully to finish with a software engineering degree). I hope everyone can provide some sort of insight on which institution they think is the best with some sort of evidence or logic behind it. I wish for the best advice because this is a huge decision I feel so don't hold back on which one is the best option and why.",

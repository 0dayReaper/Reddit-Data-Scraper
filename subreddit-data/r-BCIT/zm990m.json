    "postText": "I'll be joining BCIT this January and all my classes are at CARI building, which means the only viable parking is Lot S.\n\nI heard it's very difficult to get a parking spot at BCIT, and when I look at the parking map, Lot S is very small. I'm guessing this is because CARI doesn't host a lot of students?\n\nHow busy is Lot S? I'm rather anxious about it since I have both morning and evening classes. With Lot S being so small, I worry I won't be able to get a spot at all.\n\nI live rather far away from BCIT so transit isn't really practical.",

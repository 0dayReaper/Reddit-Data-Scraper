On and on about echo chambers, safe spaces and social justice being bad, had us reading Mein Kampff (to be critical of it to be fair, but still\u2026)\n\nI\u2019m the furthest thing from a far left progressive, love the South Park jokes making fun of them, but this felt over the top.\n\nAlso a bullshit grader, easy pass but good luck getting over 75%. Even he will tell you he doesn\u2019t like handing out good grades.",

He is very helpful when you ask and follow his rules.\nHe is very \"my way or the highway\" but I think it's mostly because he has streamlined his course a LOT.\n\nIn terms of passing his course, it's easy to get to a passing grade by getting all his syntax for the midterm and finals, plus the discussion board assignments. (IIRC, 30-40% of the final grade is doing things his way and the easy discussion board assignments)",

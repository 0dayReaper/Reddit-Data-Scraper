From the 3rd paragraph onwards: https://www.bcit.ca/programs/medical-laboratory-science-diploma-full-time-6615dipma/#details \n\n&gt;\u2026Clinical placements are located in a variety of accredited laboratories throughout BC including the Interior, the Kootenay region, Vancouver Island and the Greater Metro Vancouver area. Not all clinical facilities are easily accessible by public transportation, students assigned to these sites must have access to personal transportation. Students are responsible for travel, accommodation arrangements and costs to, during and from their clinical experience.\n\n&gt;Note: For clinical site assignment, an automated matching program is used, where students input their preferences for clinical placements. However, there is no guarantee that students will receive a clinical site assignment from their list of preferred sites. Students must be prepared to attend their assigned placement at any of the clinical sites in the province.\n\n&gt;Clinical partners:\nFraser Health Authority, \nInterior Health Authority, \nLifeLabs Medical Laboratory Services, \nProvidence Health Authority, \nProvincial Health Services Authority, \nVancouver Coastal Health Authority, \nVancouver Island Health Authority",

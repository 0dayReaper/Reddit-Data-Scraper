I think I'm intermediate level (I can understand better than I can speak or write). Will I be able to follow the course? Are there many presentations at the beginning of the course?",

O nota \u00e9 bem pensada e se voc\u00ea tirar acima disso, voc\u00ea provavelmente se sair\u00e1 bem l\u00e1. Al\u00e9m disso se lembre que existem muitos estudantes internacionais no mesmo barco. N\u00e3o acredito que o ingl\u00eas ser\u00e1 t\u00e3o complexo para aulas de TI",

            "comment": "Hello there and welcome to Canada! I just completed the fswd program at BCIT so I might have some insight. From my experience, at least half of my classmates were international students. The only kids that get into this program that are born in Canada are top tier Canadian students which have good morals and will not judge you on your English. Everyone that goes to Bcit are super nice and understanding. The communication instructor for me at least (Sam-Lee) is an absolutely amazing English teacher. No fluff, he is the real deal. Cares about his students and taught us many valuable life skills in English. Not sure if the instructor would be different for the new intakes but if you have Sam your in great hands. I think you\u2019ll Forsure be able to follow the course material as there is only a few English courses in the program. There are some presentations that you will do but you will get used to it and will get better with speaking English as you get more comfortable speaking in front of a group. One unique thing about the fswd program is that there are only 25 seats and you will be with the same classmates throughout the entire program. So, you\u2019ll get to know each other very well and then it makes presentations much easier. If you have any questions at all just dm me, cheers and goodluck!",

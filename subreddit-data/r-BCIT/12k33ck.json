Nothing to do with comp sci.\n\nIn retrospect it wasn't necessary. Job requirements are 'nice to have', not required (usually). If you've got a couple years experience and can pass their leetcode interview you should be fine.\n\nThat said. If you find your career stalls out, and you've got the time and money, there's nothing wrong with getting the btech.",

Had NAFTA TN project work in the USA and couldn't take it due to lack of degree, cost me even more money.\n\nWorking in tech, $70k is nothing. Doing a BTech will suck but it will also open doors that would otherwise remain closed, our culture is still obsessed with that stupid piece of paper.",

You can definitely get skills from an education, but you can also learn just about all you need from books and online resources as well. \n\nI think most job descriptions say bachelors degree or relevant experience, or a mixture no?\n\nI personally feel like 3-4 years of professional experience as a developer, is probably more valuable than a bachelors degree, to move ahead. I know plenty of people without degrees who are senior devs. Many making over 150k a year.\n\nI would say most are backend devs. So maybe that\u2019s something to consider. I feel like from job postings I\u2019ve seen front end devs don\u2019t have the same earning potential, but ymmv.\n\nBut ya\u2026 it really comes down to you I think and how good you are. A bachelors degree isn\u2019t going to get you a senior role without any experience, it\u2019s not a magic, I\u2019ve got a btech, I\u2019m a sr dev now and should be making 150+k a yr now. But 4-5-6 years as a dev I\u2019d be like, more money pls. Or make a move to another company.",

Jr/Sr/etc signify experience, not education. Some companies may want certain positions to have certain education requirements, but having a PHD in Computer Science doesn't automatically make you a Sr Software Architect or whatever.",

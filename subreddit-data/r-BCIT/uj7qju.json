            "comment": "Bruh this is so true, that I created a throwaway just to comment. (My username is no-time-to-cry because there is literally no time to cry). It is not just one instructor that ensures no time for self-care, it is the entire BCIT institution.\n\nI agree. I saw that email and it is really out of touch with BCIT students. I'm sure it is the marketing side of BCIT and that they have to write these emails to show to the public that they care about their students. BCIT just wants your money.\n\nAll those newsletter emails from Kathy Kinloch (BCIT prez) and video she makes ? I just delete them. Ain't nobody got time to watch her 'scripted-for-the-public' videos.\n\nI'm in CST and would never have time to participate in clubs, events, and relax like regular students. I have had quick cries throughout the terms, but immediately after, I make myself focus on homework, assignments, studying, projects, just to stay afloat. As for clubs and events, I would love to go to them. But again, every hour you stop studying means 5% drop in grades. That's how I feel.\n\nMy secret thought is that the BCIT campuses are designed to be as boring as possible because they know that the students won't have time to enjoy them anyways. E.g. UBC has the Nitobe Garden where students can go to relax. If BCIT had it, I would have no time to go lol\n\nAlso, I don't know how those social media student contributors for the BCIT Instagram pages have time to go around and film themselves all over campus. I have not seen a CST student contribute to these things....ain't nobody got time for that\n\nI like BCIT in that I feel like I learned more useful stuff in one term than in my entire university degree, honestly.\n\nRANT OVER, but maybe not. I'll edit stuff as they come up in my brain",

            "comment": "My BCIT instructors were the same way. Their classes were brutal. Very little time to study &amp; sink in the material. The chief instructor would always tell us that if we want it bad enough, we had to make sacrifices. So, no more workouts, no more hobbies, no more anything. It was just all about hitting the books &amp; focussing on assignments. The surprise tests were meant to fail people. It was the way the questions were worded, just understanding what was being asked was a chore. Then came the choices for answers. They were all alike. If not alike, then the choices would be correct for the wrong conversions, hence understanding what the question was asking for.\n\nIn 2nd year, I worked on a type of engineering assignment that took me 12 hrs, almost straight, to complete. It took a lot of time &amp; effort to understand, but I know I had to get better. The next one took 6 hrs, same type of assignment. The next took 4. The exam for that section of the course had three of these assignments. All the exams were brain melters.\n\nAbout half the class failed. So when we moved into the next year, the vacant spots would be filled with whoever failed the level we were going into. People recognize when you say you did the program at BCIT. Sure there's other institutions, but people seem to treat BCIT grads a little different. Sometimes, it's not all good cuz there are people out there who are jealous asses cuz you did the BCIT route. A pattern I sorta see is that the troubleshooters &amp; service techs out there tend to be BCIT grads &amp; people who took the same program, but at a different institute, would be in the construction side. On a final note, whatever I experienced at BCIT, it was a lot easier than the experience on the field. The work experience after BCIT was like half a dozen times harder. Dealing with books is a lot easier than company politics, let's just say that, lol. Then again, when the money comes, you can't stop it even if you want to.",

            "comment": "Goran is a typical good math teacher. Knows his stuff, explains them well. He goes into how each concept came to be. Once you fully understand, the concepts settle in your brain. You can always ask him questions, he\u2019s very caring if let him know you\u2019re stuck.\n\nI never took Jason\u2019s math class, but I\u2019ve taken his other courses so I\u2019m speaking from those experience. He\u2019s also a good teacher, but his class was very fast-paced compared to Goran. He  digests the material for you, then spoon feeds you. It\u2019s an efficient way of teaching. I guess that\u2019s because he wanted to squeeze in those motivation speeches on starting side hustles. Since I picked up the materials quite fast during classes, the pace never really bothered me, the speeches are cool to hear, too. But I did see some classmates struggling a bit during class. \n\nPersonally I don\u2019t like the prof digesting the material for me, because I forget it quickly with nothing to look into later on. I prefer learning how things came to be as it\u2019s harder to lose something with a structure in you mind, and you can always derive the concepts from scratch if you forget them one day. That\u2019s just personal preference though.",

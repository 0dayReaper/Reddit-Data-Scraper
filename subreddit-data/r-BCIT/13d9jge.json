Sometimes the whole program is together in an auditorium, sometimes it's just your set in a lab.\n\nYou will be with those 20 people, in every class, for the first year. At least. You will spend most of your free time with them, in the library or the gym or wherever. you will set up a discord and chatter all day and all night. They will work on you with projects.\n\nIf you're lucky, you'll make some friends.",

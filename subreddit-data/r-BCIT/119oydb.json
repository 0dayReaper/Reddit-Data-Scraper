But otherwise yes, you'll def need to do some reading and spend time digesting the content to understand the concepts.",

I def recommend annotating or marking down the pages that are heavy on concepts and going back to study those specific areas in the readings. If you can understand and explain the theories they're trying to teach, the exams won't be very difficult. Definitely also reach out to the instructors to clarify questions, they're all great and approachable and eager to help.",

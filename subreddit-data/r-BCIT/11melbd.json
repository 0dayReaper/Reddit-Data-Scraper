            "comment": "I wouldn't say there is a Pros and Cons comparison for the two programs. Both are different in nature.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that:\nBITMAN = handles more data analysis from a business perspective. The information age we are at now needs more skills in dealing with huge data sets coming in and out. That's where BITMAN grads can position themselves.\n\nCISA = handles more on networks may it be virtual, wireless, or physical networks. This is more on the end to end communication and how those networks affect the communication.\n\nYou want to be in the business side of things then, BITMAN might be for you. You want to be in the hardware and network side of things then CISA might be what you are after.",

You can be successful on both, the same time, be also unsuccessful on both.\n\nThe question you should ask is what do you really want in the end given the route that both can give you.",

It really depends on the type of career you want.\n\nBITMAN focuses on business skills first, whereas CISA is a more technical program.\n\nIf you want to be a business analyst who helps organizations with their digital transformation and analytics them BITMAN is a good option.\n\nIf you want to be the one managing the technology then CISA is right for you.",

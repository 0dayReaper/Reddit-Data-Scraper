    "postText": "I got home from work on Monday and decided it was time for a change and to pursue passion and a field I will love until the day I die. I remembered that BCIT had two programs that I was interested in and should wish I had done once I discovered my adoration for our forests, wildlife, the outdoors and preservation of it. So I hopped online and noticed that the intake is next week and I don't have a Bio 11 for the Fish, Wildlife and Recreation (FWR); but I do meet the requirements for Forest and Natural Areas Management (FNAM).\n\nI am curious on what peoples opinions are for a chance of getting myself in the FWR program for Fall2023. I just enrolled myself in a Life Sciences 11 course (formerly biology) with the expectation I can get it done before January. Does anyone who views this have any experience with applying to a program before meeting the prereq? I feel I would be middle of the pack for competitiveness. Here is my background:\n\n\nOutdoor enthusiast; backpacking, hiking, climbing\n\nVolunteer FD; 2.5years\n\nMEC (mountain equipment co-op/company); 4 years\n\nTelecomm lineworker; 1 year and ongoing\n\nKPU structural CADD diploma; one of the highest GPAs\n\n\nI have experience juggling a busy life. I worked Full time at MEC while in Fire, and my work weeks right now are unpredictable. 40hrs is a slow week, 50-60 is more regular with every 4th week emergency on-call for all 7 days. Im no stranger to a busy schedule. Thanks to anyone opinions, advice or answers in advance!",

            "comment": "Hey! I graduated from FWR in 2019. It sounds like you're a great fit for the program and I think you have a good chance at being accepted. The students in my class ranged from fresh out of high school to many people that already had degrees,  some unrelated.  It's hard to say what they look at to choose candidates,  but I think if you just show enthusiasm for the program and for a life change they would be happy to see it. I thunk they just want people that are excited about the content, willing to work hard and pursue a career in the field. It's also quite challenging in terms of work load so hearing about your normally busy schedule would probably help as well. Time management is key to making it through the program. You could also apply to both FNAM and FWR and see what happens. I think in general there are more career opportunities with FWR and with FNAM i think you're pretty restricted to forestry. Let me know if you have any more questions!",

I don't think they would accept you without the bio course requirement completed.  But you may be able to say it's in progress and you acceptance might be contigent on completing it. They probably have to do that for high school students that apply.",

How did you enjoy the program? Did you have a favourite or least favourite aspect aside from course/work load? Have you moved into a career path with this program?",

It and its grads have a really good really good reputation especially around the lower mainland. I was hired immediately after the program ended by a large consulting company that had some employees that had attended the same program and knew it produced good employees. I think my favorite aspect was the year long project in the second year. My group decided to create our own project instead of picking a legacy one and we learned so much more because we had to figure our methods as well. Least favorite part was that some of the instructors were set in their ways and they weren't the most effective at teaching and some times the field trios weren't very valuable as hands on experience, which is what I really joined the program for. That being said, I thunk the program has gone through some  changes since I completed it.",

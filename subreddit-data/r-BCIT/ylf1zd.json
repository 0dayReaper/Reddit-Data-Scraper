            "comment": "Im in CST and asked about the Bsc this term. They are working on the program currently and without any setbacks, the earliest it releases would be fall 2023. They also said there is no guarantees, there could be major unknown problems that could lead to the Bsc being delayed  or completely scrapped. They are planning on bridging BTech students into the Bsc, as the BTech program would be no longer offered. They're also working on being able to apply to other universities masters programs with the BCIT Bsc. Intake is planned to be twice a year rather than BTechs once a year. No known curriculum atm but it would probably be similar to other universities, probably includes calculus. There is very little information being given out on the program.",

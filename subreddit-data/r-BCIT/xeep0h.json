I was 30th+ on the waitlist, so I applied for CIT instead. I read a lot of past Reddit threads and it does not look promising for people with our average. :(\n\nThere's a slim chance that you get accepted though! \\*cross fingers for good luck\\*\n\n*Side note:  I suggest improving your English and applying for the next cohort or having another program to get into by January 2023 (may it be at BCIT or another school).*",

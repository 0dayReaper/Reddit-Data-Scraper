Also on the website it says that each student has 1/3 chance of getting accepted. Will I be able to get accepted if I have above minimum grades as listed above? And how can I increase my chances of getting accepted???",

Half of my class failed after the first semester, and the class is generally small(i think we start with 40 people), i think the program is fairly easy to get in, compare between the course requirement and the stuff that we have to dealt with. I think you\u2019ll get the offer just fine.",

I think it\u2019s because they can\u2019t adapt fast enough to the study pace, the hardest thing was the Digital Elex and the DC Elex class, they\u2019re both electrical classes and the pace in these 2 classes is crazy. They\u2019ll teach you from the basic but high school does not teach you enough electrical to begin with so some of the students are just giving up instead of seeking for help. I\u2019m still in my program so an average week of studying would be studying on school during the day and completing assignments during the night then restart, assignments will take most of your free time after school, i\u2019d recommend you try and do them all because there were some cases failed because they end up at 49% and ignore assignments for the whole term and it\u2019s just a good thing to practice more since there won\u2019t be that much test and quiz so each of them count. \n\nOverall, first term is for you to get used to the pace of the program and learn how to work with your classmate. It won\u2019t be that much of a challenge but seek help immediately when you need it because we learn new materials everyday and all of them will be on the test. \n\nHope this help in anyway!",

Or you can simply come talk to the instructor, get peer tutor. I mean there are a tons of ways, i usually just went to the instructor during my break time.",

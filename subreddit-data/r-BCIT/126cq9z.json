I know it\u2019s engineering and that it\u2019ll be hard but, I\u2019m much more looking for any personal story\u2019s that any alumni or current students have about the diploma program or the complete degree. For more specific information, I\u2019d like to know how much time you need to spend studying and what are some things you could possibly prepare for before the program starts.",

            "comment": "Dual Diploma ECET grad here, it was hard no doubt. No real time for a part time job at all, most weeknights will be spent doing homework and/or studying. I lived in the dorms so it was a bit easier, but still spend lots of time in the books. Some say it's the hardest program at BCIT...\n\nDon't be discouraged though, try and make some friends in your set. That will help out a lot with note taking and having people to bounce topics off of. I ended up going modified for a year so I was stuck solo a lot of the time. \n\nIt was real hard for me as I developed *terrible* study habits in highschool, and had to go modified for my 2nd semester. Took a year to catch back up but I finished computer control with a full load of courses in my final semester. \n\n**Go to prof office hours, go to proctor labs.**",

            "comment": "Current ECET student. \nI am doing co-op right now, but I have finished the first year of the program. It is definitely a hard program. I was always at school from 8 in the morning till 8 in the evening, studying with my friends. Having a great study group really helps. I would suggest that you start with basic circuit analysis and some calculus courses to have a strong foundation. \nCome prepared that you will be studying at least 60 hours a week or even more. Exam week is the worst as you'll have close to no sleep, but trust me, it's all worth it. If you're aiming for B-Eng (4 years), then make sure you are close to 90% cGPA at the end of the year because it is a competitive entry with only 32 accepted each year. Diplomas are not competitive but still require a great amount of time and effort to graduate. \nGood luck, and never give UP!",

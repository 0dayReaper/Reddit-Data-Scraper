    "postText": "Hello! I've gotten accepted by UBC Vancouver and I would like to pursue Biotechnology later after my first year. However, I've been informed that students seeking to do Biotechnology would need to shift to BCIT for 2 years for the Co-op program. If there are any biotechnology students attending BCIT (And UBC Vancouver) could you please tell me about your experience with the Co-op programs you've undergone (or undergoing) and how you've been able to benefit from them? I've seen that Vancouver has the most biotechnology firms so does being a BCIT+UBC student help in securing anything there?",

            "comment": "Hey! 3rd yr biotech student here. For the co-op program I would say you gain mainly research experience. I have  only done so far a coop at an academic lab and I did mostly practical hands on work. The pay, as you can guess, is minimum wage but if you work at a big company you can get above that. I would say as a BCIT-UBC student you do get benefits in terms of having higher chances securing a coop as a result of your laboratory skills. Is there anything else about the coop program you want to know? Feel free to dm me!",

I read the other comment posts made and they had all advised me against Biotechnology as a major due to it being severely underpaid which has frightened me slightly. I understand the minimum wages point however are you taking up any other part time jobs to sustain yourself? I'd love to DM you to ask just a few more questions, the help is really appreciated.",

I used to want to do it and thank goodness I didn't cause I couldn't afford it and neither can you.\n\nLook at the grad and jobs stats posted on BCITs website and how much money you will make and you can select something else. $17. You cannot afford to do this.",

It cost me 5 yrs of time, potential pay and my degree never helped me in my job hunt. No one wanted a biology student they wanted comp sci, engineering and business. Nowadays it's the same.\n\nVancouver is expensive to live in, a minimum wage job today can't sustain your rent, food and entertainment expenses after your graduate. And also why does program where you can make minimum wage when you can work at Costco and make the same and better. Truly truly believe me and look into an alternative program/diploma at BCIT and UBC.\n\nThe best thing I should have done back then was quit UBC in my 2nd/3rd yr and went to BCIT for their programs or went directly into the workforce so I could afford real estate earlier. But parents were adamant a degree is invaluable, trust me your experience is invaluable not your degree and definitely not a biotechnology degree that pays nil.",

We both brainstormed the options for her back to school to switch career for better pay so here are some options this was 8 years ago and I still remember vividly  radiation therapist , MRI tech , ultrasound, respiratory therapy, medical physicist and dosimetry. All are good options and wonderful compensation. She end up getting into respiratory therapy.",

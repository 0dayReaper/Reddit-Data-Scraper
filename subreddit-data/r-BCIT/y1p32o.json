    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am a co-op student for CST as a System Admin/IT support. I will be completing my CST with an overall 4.0 GPA this semester.\n\nI have experience in learning linux fundamentals and penetration testing from the tryhackme website. Additionally, I have a 98% in English 12.  Will I get into BTech Cybersecurity? I am very stressed out as I wait and really need to get into this program.\n\nThank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nSorry for the post. Ik there has been similar posts and memes about asking this question. I have done my research and haven't found any helpful information. As I am in CST and not in a more IT field like CIT or CISA",

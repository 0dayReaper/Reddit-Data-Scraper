What are the possibility of getting in the program? Is there any chance? If there is no seat available for the program, do I have to re-apply for the next intake?",

Lots of people drop as the date gets closer. \n\nIt's true there aren't as many internationals in this program as others but I think our cohort had more than 5 international students in the first semester. Might be wrong though. The program only fits about 26 students per cohort entirely.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much. Worst case scenario yeah you can run again next semester but you'll probably get in fine.",

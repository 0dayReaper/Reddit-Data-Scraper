    "postText": "Hi everyone! My name is Brianna Doyle and I\u2019m on the board of the SNA. I\u2019m trying to build on student benefits for student nurses and other student associations of BCIT. Is anyone interested in a student discounted pass for Fitness World? Still working on pricing, I\u2019m thinking $5/mth for the Burnaby location, and $10-15/month for all locations? \n\nPricing for students also extends to families. These prices are for NEW members only. \n\nLet me know your thoughts!",

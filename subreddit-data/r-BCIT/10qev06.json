    "postText": "Hey, so I got in CISA, and I'm attending this fall. I had some questions, , before attending this program. I do not specifically want to enter Systems Admin workforce e, but want to do something related to tech. Is this possible, or does this program mainly just train for the specific job of Sys, and not giving a variety, or broad options.\n\nSo after finished the Diploma here, would I be able to indulge in a further Bachelor or degree at BCIT?",

If you\u2019re looking for a program that will provide you with a more well-rounded IT background, you need to look into CIT Diploma.",

As majority of what is taught in CIT is programming, based I'm thinking this won't suite me. I was initially, thinking of picking CIT, cause I heard lot's of good thing's about it, including their Co-op, but unfortunately, it's a bit out of hand for me.",

But even if you go the CISA / IT infrastructure route, you will still need to pick up coding in order to automate parts of the infrastructure you\u2019ll be working on. It\u2019s more akin to scripting instead of software development.",

I currently work in help desk so I may not be the best person to ask but from everything I've been reading, the economy here is slowing and we may be going into a recession.  It definitely feels like hiring has slowed down.  That said, if you're starting your diploma program this September, you'll need to worry about how the economy will be 2 years from now.",

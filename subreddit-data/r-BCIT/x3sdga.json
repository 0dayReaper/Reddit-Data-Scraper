            "comment": "All the faculty members are former journalists in the industry; some more recent than others. None are actually so long-tenured to the extent of being 'PhD' academics and who prefer to be addressed as 'Professor' or 'Doctor'. You can relax with decorum and address them on a first-name basis.\n\nMic recommendation is to pick something along the lines of an all-in-one recorder that comes with a built-in stereo mic, USB port to plug into a computer (giving you a double-function USB mic &amp; audio interface), SD memory card slot, and XLR jacks to plug in external mics XLR-cabled.\n\ne.g. [Zoom H4n](https://zoomcorp.com/en/ca/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h4n-pro/) and [Tascam DR-40X](https://tascam.com/us/product/dr-40x/top) are a good all-in-one devices\n\nI think they still recommend the [Electrovoice 635](https://products.electrovoice.com/ap/en/635a/) as a handheld field mic, but you can choose a something lighter weight and with a longer super-cardioid pattern instead of that one.",

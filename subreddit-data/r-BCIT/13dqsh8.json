Able to connect with fellows biomed and understand that they are many specializations many teams responsible to various unique health departments . Good luck",

You can easily learn networking/regulatory/DICOM etc. on the job or on your own. \n\nAlso, maybe during a ladder program to SFU to reach a biomed degree doesn't seem as good since we're not credited as much and still require 3 or 4 years to obtain a BA. That may have changed since I graduated from BMET though.\n\nOverall I still believe it's a good program for the time you spend and afterwards there's fairly OK paying job opportunities.",

It's vendor management and parts ordering - troubleshooting position, in my opinion. \n\nI have taken EE courses on top of the BMET EE courses and to be honest the material is presented in a much better way on the EE side.   It's simple not tailored to EEG, ecg, and other physiological signals. \n\nImaging technology exposure (no pun intended) is huge too.",

Fresh biomed grads that choose to work in LMBME usually start off as casuals that work full time hours so they get %13.6 in lieu of vacation and sick time. Which is why a new Biomed grad would make about $41 starting, and they could continue to make that amount if they choose to stay as casuals. Obviously it\u2019s not ALL rainbows and sunshine. I\u2019m simply pointing out that being a public sector biomed pays more than people might first imagine.",

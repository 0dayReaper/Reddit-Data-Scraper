            "comment": "BCIT's CST Diploma focusses heavily on programming languages. BCIT also offers an Applied Software Development certificate, which is a part-time program that is a subset of the CST courses and solely contains programming courses. \n\nFull-time: You can view the BCIT CST Diploma course list at [https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/#courses](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/#courses). \n\nPart-time: You can view the BCIT ASD Certificate course list at [https://www.bcit.ca/programs/applied-software-development-asd-associate-certificate-part-time-6958acert/#courses](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/applied-software-development-asd-associate-certificate-part-time-6958acert/#courses). After completing the ASD Certificate, you can progress to completing the Computer Systems Certificate and then Diploma through BCIT Flexible Learning.\n\nBoth the full-time and part-time programs provide the opportunity to pursue a bachelor's degree after completing the diploma.\n\nI would encourage you to connect with BCIT Advising at [https://www.bcit.ca/advising/](https://www.bcit.ca/advising/) for more information. \n\nThe CST program at St. Lawrence College is designed for a Computer Systems Technician career path. Camosun no longer offers a CST program, and their replacement is IT focused. BCIT offers a similar program called CIT, but it does not involve much programming.",

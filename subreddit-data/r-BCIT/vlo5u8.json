            "comment": "I did BCIT's Advanced Diploma in Business Management followed by their BBA program, all part-time (evenings and weekends). I really enjoyed the courses and they gave me a solid foundation for further learning and professional development. The part-time option was super convenient as I was not in a position to study business full-time when I did the program.\n\nI had very few opportunities to choose my profs (most courses either had only one offering or did not have profs confirmed at registration time). I browsed Rate my Professors but I didn't give it much weight (strong self selection bias). I had many awesome profs and some not-so-awesome, but I don't have any complaints overall.\n\nFeel free to ask any specific questions you might have!",

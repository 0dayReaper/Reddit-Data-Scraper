    "postText": "I'm thinking of applying to BCIT's CST program.  I graduated back in 2011 with fairly good grades in math and English (95%+ for math, 90ish for English).  I went to school for mechanical engineering at UBC, but my grades were fairly average/slightly below average for some courses.  I'm wondering if it would be better to apply using my high school grades only, of if this is even allowed?  Or would it make me a stronger candidate if I applied with my sub-par university grades?",

I'm assuming you successfully completed an intensive 4-year degree in STEM from a competitive university, in which case, you shouldn't sell it short. \n\nI had my own entry requirements questions when applying, and you can get admissions on the phone to hash it out pretty easily.\n\nSource: Applied and was admitted with an average post-secondary gpa, worse than highschool. 4-year degree from UVic, banged out Pre-Calc 11 and 12 with (95+ each) right before the first term. It's worth a shot.",

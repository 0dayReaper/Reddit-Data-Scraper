    "postText": "Hello BCIT students!\n\nI am a Canadian university student doing a research study on romantic couples. You will get a $15 gift card (per couple) and the study is completely online. If you and your partner meet the study requirements, I would really appreciate your participation! **The gift card will only be valid for use in Canada (i.e. Tim Hortons, Starbucks Canada), so please do not apply if you are not living in Canada as the gift card will not work in any other country.**\n\nParticipant Requirements:\n\n\\-19 years of age or older\n\n\\-Been in the romantic relationship for at least 6 months.\n\n\\-Both members of the couple must reside within Canada.\n\nStudy Procedure:\n\n\\-An online survey to be completed independently by both partners prior to the Zoom session (approx. 20 mins)\n\n\\-A Zoom session with both partners and another online survey during the Zoom (approx. 20 mins, cameras off).\n\nIf you are interested please visit the following link: [https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/SKFJFTD](https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/SKFJFTD) and enter your contact information!\n\n\\*This study has been approved by the UFV Human Research Ethics Board (protocol #101158)",

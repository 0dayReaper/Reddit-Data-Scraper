Is there pros and cons to either? I know that SSD is only 8 months not including the comp pre requisites whereas CST is 2 years. Any second opinions would be appreciated thanks you",

            "comment": "In my opinion:\n\nDo CST if you can. Long term it will set you up to be in a stronger position. SSD doesn't really cover topics like algorithm analysis, data comm, computer architecture, operating systems, and so on.\n\nSSD is good for people that are established in another field and want to quickly switch to tech (specifically, web development) eg. I know people with degrees in accounting, physics, mech eng, etc. that have done SSD.",

Especially if you are planning to go into the degrees (B.tech, B.C.Sci, or BBA)\nSSD is good if you are already established and want additional skills.\n\nPersonally i would recommend doing CST for the 2 years and then doing the degree part time over the next few. Sure you are in school for awhile, but the overall skill gain is worth it.",

            "comment": "In terms of cost, I think they're about the same. The SSD program is quite expensive. It does however have an industry co-op at the end. Whereas for CST, co-op is not guaranteed, only a handful of students from first year would get a co-op. Furthermore, if you do co-op you might not get the major you want if it is not available on the term you want to go into. \n\nGiven you're 20 years old. Go for CST. It might say 8 months for SSD. But CST is 8 months first year and 8 months second year. It just has the summer added in to make it close to 2 years. Likely if you get co-op it'll be closer to 3 years.\n\nIf your long term plan is to get a BTech. SSD is a no. As you can't ladder to CST Diploma. And laddering to BTech is harder and not as smooth as having a CST Diploma. \n\nI am a recent graduate from December 2022. Still looking for a job. I did only 1 interview. The market is not so good at the moment at least for me. I have classmates that got jobs already, both with and without co-ops. \n\nIf you're into Web Development. Full Stack Developer (FSD) may help you more. As it has more courses in design that CST doesn't have.",

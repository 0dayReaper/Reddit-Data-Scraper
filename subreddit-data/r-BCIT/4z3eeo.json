    "postText": "Hopefully this post will help you in your first semester of study. If you can stick it out until January, you're probably at the point where you know what it takes, and can make it on your own from there.\n\nBCIT isn't a cakewalk. At most Universities, you take multiple electives and choose your course load. If you want, you can take an extra year to spread things thin. At BCIT, you'll be given a set schedule that takes up nearly as many hours as a full-time job, without even counting studying and homework. Most undergrad schedules have you taking a default five courses per term. Here, you'll be doing seven. In fact, you'll be taking more credit-hours than most people take in a 4-year degree program, just to get through 2 years of BCIT engineering. \n\nI've met several people in this program who have gone through bachelor's degrees, even post-grad, and still thought this was the toughest, most stressful year of their academic lives. \n\nYou don't have to be a genius, just be prepared to work. BCIT is like the French Foreign Legion - they'll let anybody in, but if you don't bust your ass, you will get dropped hard. \n\n**Workload, stress, and commitment**\n\n* If you want to enter the bachelor degree path, you will need to maintain high grades in your first year. Otherwise, you finish after two years with a diploma in Design, Systems, or Manufacturing. In the 2015-16 school year, the lowest accepted average was **76%,** with a total of 35 students accepted into the B.Eng program.\n\n* Close to 15% of our class had dropped out by the end of our first year. \n\n* Classes will take up about 30 hours per week, and you can expect to add *at least* 15-20 hours of homework and study to that if you want to do well. \n\n* Do **not** plan on being able to hold a part-time job. I suggest student loans or lines of credit.\n\n* If you are in a serious relationship, it will be strained. \n\n* If you have a serious gaming habit, it will probably harm your grades.\n\n* If you fail or drop a class, you'll have to take it over the summer or at night. \n\n* The saying \"hard work beats talent, when talent doesn't work hard\" will apply here more than anywhere else in your life. \n\n* The benefit you get from this program will be directly proportional to your effort. You will get out what you put in.\n\n**General Tips**\n\n\n* Review your graded assignments and exams. I can probably credit as much as 2-3% of my final first year GPA to marks that I had to argue for. \n\n* Find a study group. You will become the average of the people you surround yourself with.\n\n* BCIT is a small school. It will be way easier to meet people compared to bigger Universities, and you can be a big fish in a small pond when it comes to standing out with personal projects or club involvement. \n\n* If you aren't prepared to sacrifice your social life and can't picture yourself pulling consistent 8-12 hour days, **DROP OUT NOW.** Make room for people on the wait list who actually have a work ethic. You'll save yourself a few months of your life, save several thousand dollars, and save someone else from waiting another year. I'm dead serious. If you're here because your parents made you sign up, or you didn't know what else to do, I guarantee* that you will not survive to see finals, and you are only wasting everyone's time. \n\n* If you want to get your hands dirty, buy some steel-toed boots and safety glasses, and walk into the shop with an idea of what you want to make or learn. If you don't know what you're doing, ask Eugene. All sorts of equipment is available, like a waterjet, plasma cutters, welding rigs, lathes, mills, 3D printers and drill presses. Try stuff out in your first semester, because capstone projects will take up all of Eugene's time starting in January.\n\n\n* Sleep is crucial. Try to get 7 hours. BCIT has nap pods in the library, not sure if they have the nap room in the gym still.\n\n\n**Pre-Requisite Knowledge and Skills**\n\n* You can get away with a high school math education. You won't do much calculus or advanced math in the first semester, that will begin in January. You should be very comfortable with algebra, substitution, trigonometry, rates and ratios, and word problems. \n\n* It will help you to be familiar with Autodesk Inventor. \n\n* If your english is terrible, you might have a hard time. You will be taking a Communications course which requires group work, writing skills, and public speaking. The instructor will not go easy on you just because you can't speak or write well. \n\n**Class Makeup** \n\n* If you are an older student, don't worry. The average age seemed to be around 22-23, with a bunch in the 25-35 bracket. \n\n* Less than 2% of the class was female. Some universities take gender into consideration for entry. BCIT does not. \n\n* While your first year class will have around 150 students, You will be split into sets of less than 25. You will go to all of your labs with these people. They will most likely be your friends and study partners.\n\n* If you want to do any work with student government, you'll want to be your Set representative, or Set Rep. Pipe up early. Establish dominance, lol \n\n* Set up a WhatsApp group for your class and set. Having lines of communication open is invaluable. Sure, sometimes it's just jokes and banter, but being able to ask about homework, tests or deadlines is invaluable.\n\n* Your classmates are colleagues, not competitors. If you are sabotaging people or don't reciprocate in exchanging help, you'll probably get cut loose from your circle. \n\n**Equipment and supplies**\n\n* The following calculators are approved. My personal preference is the HP-35s, because it has great clicky buttons, and it's the most powerful calculator allowed in the FE Exam. In practice, everyone went with the $18 Sharp. If you do go with the cheapo Sharp calculators, be sure you get a model that can do integrals. \n\n1. Sharp EL-520\n\n2. Sharp EL-546\n\n3. HP 33S\n\n4. HP 35S\n\n\n* A Microsoft Surface (or any laptop with an active digitizer stylus) running OneNote will be a big help to your note-taking and organization. Add Office Lens to your phone, it's a killer combo.\n\n* Gaming laptops, iPads and Macbook Pros are wasted money. You don't need a ton of processing power or a discrete GPU unless you want an excuse to play games, which you won't have time for anyways. You don't need much to handle small assemblies in Inventor or Solidworks, and there are plenty of workstations at school. OSX doesn't run any relevant software, standard iPads don't have palm rejection, and none of these machines will beat a pen and paper for notetaking. If you're buying something to run CAD, just make sure it has at least 8GB of RAM and over 256GB of storage. \n\n* If you're buying a mouse, get something that's got dongle-less Bluetooth. Unplugging to deal with a flash drive gets so annoying.\n\n* CSA-Approved steel-toed footwear and eye protection are mandatory in the shop. You'll need them in second semester, may as well grab some now.\n\n* Everyone will want to borrow your stapler. \n\n**Course Info**\n\n**Applications and programming**\n\n* This is the easiest course you will have in your entire BCIT Engineering career. Don't waste this chance to get an easy A+. Read instructions carefully, dot your i's and cross your t's. \n\n* Alan Inglis is your first-year program head. While the course may seem easy, treat him with respect, because he'll have influence on whether you make it into the program of your choice. \n\n**Energy Systems**\n\n* This class can be a challenge. Many people walk out of the lectures confused. Go to office hours or talk to your Lab instructor, and force yourself through the problem sheets. \n\n* Having an understanding of integrals and \"area under the curve\" will help you grasp some of the hydrostatic stuff. You won't use any calculus in this course, but it conceptually underpins a whole bunch of it. \n\n* Your homework starts out with a ton of work on units. It's tedious, but honestly, it really does help to be able to break problems into base units so that you can properly check your solutions. \n\n* Google \"slugs,\" and learn the difference between pound-force and pound-mass. It'll be better that you understand now, because it usually sounds crazy in lectures.\n\n**Engineering Graphics**\n\n* This course will be split between learning Autodesk Inventor, and traditional drafting on paper. Take it seriously, because your first semester GPA weighs this course heavier than others.\n\n* It's easy to dismiss the pencil and paper drafting components of this course, but you will end up using these skills, and they will kill you on the tests unless you get the habits down. \n\n* The Inventor portion of your exams will ask you to recall some seriously obscure stuff that gets thrown at you in lecture. I suggest going to lectures, and making **full** use of Neil's single page cheat-sheet allowance.\n\n**Engineering Materials**\n\n* Course slides are available on D2L. Download or print them before the lecture, and fill them out as you go. \n\n* If you can read ahead on textbook sections, you'll get more out of the lectures. \n\n* If you have Mark Gendron as your lab instructor, prepare to be absolutely brutalized on your first lab report. When he says he doesn't want extra crap in the report, *he means it.* This is not your grade 11 English class. Don't spout bullshit and use your thesaurus just to fill the page and sound smart. Stay concise and clear, and follow instructions carefully.\n\n* This is a tough course to study for. Lots of flashcards and practice. Tons of terms. \n\n* When you subscribe to this  course on WileyPlus, it comes with an online version of the text. This is way cheaper than buying a physical copy.\n\n**Statics**\n\n* You had better be good with triangles and trigonometry.\n\n* The course textbook costs a ridiculous amount of money and covers both Statics and Dynamics. Most of us got by without it, but I did hear that exam questions sometimes closely resembled practice problems from the book.\n\n* Do a ton of practice problems. These exams are brutal in terms of the amount of work you are expected to do in 50 minutes. Being able to solve problems is not enough - you need to be able to solve them quickly. \n\n* When you are taught to use different methods in truss analysis, don't just pick your favorite. Exams will specifically ask you to use certain methods. Same applies to couples...if you fill a page with equations on a problem that is solved in 30 seconds by identifying a couple, don't expect full marks even if you get the correct solution. \n\n**Technical Communication** \n\n* This should be your second-easiest course in your first semester if you take it seriously, and put a somewhat decent effort into your presentation and assignments. \n\n* There will not be a ton of homework, but that final group presentation deadline will sneak up on you. I saw tons of groups kill their overall course mark due to a half-assed presentation. Practice ahead of time, choose a topic with plenty of sources, and make sure you are organized and clear. 20% of your grade is determined by this 20-minute presentation.\n\n* Darlene is like a guidance counselor, english teacher and career adviser rolled into one. If you are willing to check your ego and ask for help, she is more than happy to help you develop your job-seeking game. \n\n**Math**\n\n* This is the most challenging course in first year for many people, but this first semester is mostly just pre-calc.\n\n* Joseph is an excellent professor, and is extremely organized in presenting his course notes and examples. Use his office hours if you are unclear, and do it before you fall behind. \n\n* You will get problem sets each week. If you can get through 80% of those questions without getting stumped, you're ready for the tests. \n\n* Do the MapleTA assignments. You get a bonus mark for completing them all.\n\n**Clubs and Extracurriculars**\n\nYou'll be stretched for time, but I still suggest checking out some of the clubs and activities while you are in first year. I signed up for everything I could, and then as things got more intense in my academics, I was able to pick and choose what clubs I still had time for. \n\n For most of the year, you won't spend more than an hour or two per week on a club's activities, and I guarantee you'll get something worthwhile out of your experience. It's the only way you'll be meeting people in upper classes, and if you're interested in getting a job, this stuff looks great on a resume. \n\n**Baja SAE, aka [BCIT Racing](http://www.bcitracing.com/)**\n\n* Baja SAE is probably the biggest and most important \"name brand\" engineering club at BCIT. They build an off-road buggy from scratch and race it in the U.S. at the end of the year. \n\n* You do not need to have any experience to join, as there are all kinds of roles available. Knowing a little bit of CAD, being able to turn a wrench, and having a good work ethic is enough to quickly catapult you into a fairly important position by second semester. \n\n* BCIT Racing generally aims to bring at least a couple first-year members to the competition.  \n\n* If you are a hands-on kind of person, this is the perfect opportunity to actually design and build something.\n\n* BTW, if you're reading this and are Civil, Robotics or EE, come check the team out. SAE doesn't discriminate between disciplines, but we've all been Mech so far.\n\n**Engineers without Borders**\n\n* This club is supervised by Darlene of COMM 1169 fame. \n\n* You'll be helping to raise funds and awareness for projects in third world countries.\n\n* Some chapters make trips to work on projects, not sure if BCIT's does. \n\n* This club is inter-disciplinary, so you can meet Civil, Mechatronic and Electrical engineering students. Not many opportunities to do that. \n\n**CSME, the [Canadian Society of Mechanical Engineers](https://www.facebook.com/BCITCSME/)**\n\n* This club is the Mech equivalent to IEEE. They put on events like class mixers, BBQ's and job fairs. \n\n**[BCIT Engineering Students Society](https://www.facebook.com/BCITESS/)**\n\n* This is an engineering club that involves all faculties, including Civil and Electrical, and helps organize Western Engineering Competition events.\n\n* CSME will look for some first-year heads to take on communications and planning roles. They'll be responsible for helping to get word out to their classmates, and plan first year events. \n\n**Western Engineering Competition, or WEC**\n\n* This is a design challenge event, where students compete to fulfil guidelines in a limited amount of time, with limited materials. Last year, teams had to build miniature sailboats and race them.\n\n* The winners at the local level can end up representing Western Canada at the national event.\n\n**One final piece of advice.**\n\n[Don't be the guy that stops taking showers.](http://i.imgur.com/jXSiuXF.jpg) Yes, everyone knows, and yes, they are talking about it behind your back.\n\n\n^^^*my ^^^guarantee ^^^means ^^^nothing",

            "comment": "Oh and if you can, get a co-op/internship every single summer doing something in engineering or manufacturing. The official BCIT coop program isn't available to you until third year which is probably the worst idea BCIT has ever had. So you need to find jobs on your own and take initiative. When you get out there in the real world, you'll be competing against UBC and SFU graduates that have multiple 4 month, 8 month and 16 month co-ops working for multiple companies and gaining experience. If you just do the official co-op in your third year you get.... 3 months of experience before fourth year starts and you start applying for full time jobs for  after grad.  Plus, UBC grads have the advantage of being from a \"Big Name School\". Hoping that employers recognize BCIT for it's \"Hands on\" learning approach and it's difficult course load is not going to cut it because frankly, many employers don't care. Experience and networking are the two most important things you need to get the job you want. Co-ops and internships will help you get both.\n\nI'm actually very salty about BCIT's co-op program for mech eng students as I've gone through it myself. It is probably BCIT's weakest link. If there's one thing that would change the hiring rates of BCIT students once they graduate, it is the amount of co-op work they do. At a measly 3 months in four years, it just plain sucks. If you can, do a long co-op and graduate a year later.\n\nAlso, join a club. I cannot stress this enough. You will make friends/future colleagues, get to know teachers, work with machines (if you're in baja), and have fun. The guy that worked on a major component on a baja car but got a %70 GPA will be hired over the guy that didn't get involved and got %100. Grades don't get you the job, networking, skills and experience will take you farther than any %100 GPA will.",

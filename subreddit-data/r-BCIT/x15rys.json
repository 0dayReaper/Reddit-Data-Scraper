    "postText": "Hi, I just applied a few days ago for the CST diploma Jan intake and had a few questions. I'm a bit nervous because I'm currently going to UBC and wanted to take CS but it's almost impossible now for me to get accepted into CS. \n\n1. Anyone who got into the sept intake what was your gpa? I've heard janurary intake is more competitive which I'm a bit nervous about. My English 12 was 89 and Pre-cal 12 was 93, so an avg of 91. Does anyone know approx what my chances of getting in might be?\n2. People who have taken or are in CST how is it? I have very minimal programming experience but I am very interested and slowly learning on my own. I've heard that there is a lot of work but is manageable if you stay on top of your work. I will definitely try my best but have been deeply struggling with procrastination my whole life... (likely ADHD/ADD related)\n3. How long does it usually take for them to either accept or reject your admission? I know it says within 4 weeks but I kind of need to be sure within 3 weeks because that's the last chance I get to drop courses at UBC.\n\nI know there are already a few posts similar to this but they all regard Sept intake, so any advice, insight, or reassurance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! :)) \n\nAlso good luck to anyone applying!!\n\nEDIT: I GOT ACCEPTED YAYYY!! good luck to anyone else who applied and lmk if u got in dt campus!!",

            "comment": "Someone asked a similar question recently so I'll just copy paste my post:\n\nI graduated almost 10 years ago, so my advice may be out of date, but I'll do my best. In no particular order:\n\n- Try to become your set rep. This will give you easier access to teachers, and give you a reason to interact with everyone in your set. It's easier to network when you're a center of contact.\n\n- At the start of the semester, each class hands you a syllabus. Compile them into one master spreadsheet. This way you can see where the pain points will be, months in advance. Like maybe you have a presentation on the same day in three classes. Instead of trying to write all three the night before, you know to space things out.\n\n- Don't buy your books in advance. A lot of times the teachers will tell you they're not necessary.\n\n- Sit in the front three rows. Many studies show students up front get higher marks.\n\n- If there is anything you don't understand in class, raise your hand and ask for clarification. That's literally what the teacher is there for. To help you understand. 99% of the time if you don't understand something, a bunch of other people in the class don't understand, and are too scared to ask.\n\n- USE TEACHER OFFICE HOURS. They're honest to god sitting in their offices hoping someone shows up to ask questions. Keith used to have tea and cookies waiting and was sad nobody showed up. They'll straight up walk you through assignments if you just show up to ask.\n\n- Cancel every subscription you have to any video games. You do not have time to game. At all. Ever.\n\n- Never skip a class. You paid for that seat, show up and sit in it.\n\n- Try to find out who the smart people in your set are and be near them at all times. BCIT is VERY heavy on group work, and you never want to end up in the leftovers group. You want to just look around at the three or four people around you, the smart people, and work with them.\n\n- Youtube is one of your best friends. Sometimes hearing the exact same lesson said with different words can really really help.\n\n- You want to get into coop, 100%. How do you do that? Your first semester is the most important semester. They line up all the marks for all the students and take the top 30. Be in that top 30.\n\n- How do you keep your marks high? Pay the fuck attention. Almost every assignment you get from a teacher will tell you exactly what you have to do to get full marks. Literally exactly. If it says they want 5 paragraphs, write 5 paragraphs. If they say two pages, give them two pages. Just do what you're told.\n\n- Sign up for summer semester classes. Third semester is brutal, but I took two classes (while doing my coop) so it was way easier. Highly recommend.\n\n- Do not use websites that answer coding questions to get answers to your assignments. You might pass the assignment, but you'll fail the midterms. SO MANY people failed midterms because they were doing this.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I can try to help.",

I did actually take some of this advice, even if it was 10 years ago, a lot of the advice still applies. I definitely will be going to office hours, because I regret not doing so at UBC. Thank you for replying I really appreciate it! :))   \n\n\nSide note, I hope that as long as I stay on top of my work I can have some free time haha",

Goodluck to us both! When we hear back I\u2019ll we searching Reddit to hopefully congratulate you",

I can't answer this as I have no personal experience.\n3. They usually respond within 4 weeks from the deadline, so there's no guarantee they can send it earlier.  I guess you have to decide when you want to drop them and getting back a refund or not.",

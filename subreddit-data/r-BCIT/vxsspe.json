    "postText": "I'm looking into changing careers into software development.  I currently have an mechanical engineering degree from UBC.  I was considering CST, but I'm wondering if there might be a quicker option for someone in my position (career changer, STEM degree holder).  Does anyone have experience with some of their certificate/statement of completion programs?  I'm sure they won't look as great on the resume as CST, but if I dedicate a lot of time to self study and building personal projects, would any of these programs be effective in getting me interviews?  Some of the programs seem a bit sketch, but I'd rather a short program + self study than go to a bootcamp if it will be enough to get my foot in the door for entry level positions.",

I've worked in the tech industry and would prefer to hire from a bootcamp over more traditional schools as the language learned in bootcamp are typically more relevant in real life. You already have an engineering degree so you could pursue larger corps like Amazon or Microsoft",

I can give you my two cents, though I'm only just about to begin Co-op, so I am still transitioning into development. \n\nCST is a solid program that can get your foot in the door, but it takes quite some time to finish and there are fluff courses that you probably wont need since you already have your degree, so I fully encourage you to try a quicker alternative if you cant afford to to not work for nearly two years. With that said, I have a couple friends that took bootcamps and it was hit or miss. Bootcamps churn out thousands of graduates each year. Think about competing for jobs against thousands of bootcamp grads, college grads, and university grads when you are done. You will definitely need to work harder to differentiate yourself with personal projects, work exp, networking, etc. And because they are only four months long, you will only have the basics covered. Personally, I didn't think 4 months of lessons would give me enough time to absorb everything and to be confident in interviews.\n\nTLDR: bootcamps can work but be extra diligent with personal projects, networking and job hunting.",

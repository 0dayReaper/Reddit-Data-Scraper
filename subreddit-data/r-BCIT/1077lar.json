    "postText": "I took comm 0005 and math 0001 and was wondering if there any good to upgrade my pre calculus 12 and English 12 mark? I missed my first 2 classes of comm due to some private problems and I\u2019m already behind. I think I might drop the english since it\u2019s in the morning and my math is a night time class which is a 6 hour gap. Any advice helps.",

However the tests will be in person. It\u2019s also free as well \n\nIf you prefer in person instruction there\u2019s other continuing education institutes that offer courses too, that are also free",

    "postText": "Hi there, my son who is 19 is driving from Ontario to BC end of August and is looking for a place to live. Like many we are on the waitlist for Res.  Are there any other nice guys out there looking to share a 2 bedroom place? It will be hard to vet out a place although a local relative may be able to help us to make sure we don't get scammed.  Would really appreciate any leads on guys looking for a nice room mate. My son is taking Business and has his own car so parking is a need too.",

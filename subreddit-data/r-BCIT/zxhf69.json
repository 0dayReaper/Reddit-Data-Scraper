    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019ll be starting a program at bcit in May and I\u2019m trying to figure out which laptop to get. \n\nI\u2019m torn between getting either a windows laptop or MacBook. Options are\u2026\n\n- Dell XPS 15 - i7 , 16GB , RTX 3050 Ti, 1Tb\n- MacBook Pro 14\u201d - M1 Pro (want a max but not available for 14\u201d) , 16GB , 16GB GPU, 1TB\n\nI\u2019m not sure which one would be better for the work that I\u2019ll be doing. I\u2019m totally new to this industry and I\u2019m just looking at the specs that the program provided. I know windows are more compatible with what you can put into the computer where as Apple is very limited. \n\nWhat would you guys recommend? Any help would be appreciated.",

    "postText": "Hi All,\nI am hoping I can get some opinions.\nI am currently in ON but work remote so moving other then financially is not an issue.\nI currently work as a Sr Sec Ops Analyst/ SOC Supervisor for 3 years.\nI have a three year diploma in cyber security. I am interested in the BCIT program. So I was hoping people could share some information.\n1. I did my advanced diploma full time while working full time, this averaged 70 hours a week between school and work. Would that be a fair assessment of what BCIT and full time work would entail?\n2. While a diploma is a requirement; can use still transfer credits from that diploma to get out of courses at BCIT? Or work experience? I primarily work in digital forensics and incident response. \n3. Can you change between part time and full time? I would ideally like to be part time online this fall and then go full time in January when my partner finishes her degree in December. Would this be possible?\n\nI will probably get this question so I will answer it. Why would I move provinces and everything when I already have work experience? I do work, however what I have found is that with tech being controlled by the US having a degree is a big deal. CompSci is not great in cybersecurity. However the thing that has come up quite a few times, a masters is what is really important mid to end career. I am only 22, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel out of place, however this would be my first time away from home.",

            "comment": "To be honest, you're probably overqualified for the program but if you really want the bachelors degree it could be an easy degree for you. Contact the program coordinator [Raymond\\_Yu@bcit.ca](mailto:Raymond_Yu@bcit.ca) with your questions as that way you'll get all the accurate and up-to-date information. \n\nYou should be able to switch between part-time and full-time but if I were you I'd just wait to go full time in January because part-time courses are more expensive and the course schedules (in part-time) sometimes don't end up working out.",

Unfortunately as I have learned the program specific courses have to be started in September and aren\u2019t offered in the other semesters. Also I was told by admissions today that full time refers to day time classes 8-4pm and part time means you have classes 5pm+.",

Im planning to do CISA, from BCIT, (Systems Admin), and then gonna indulge in a Bachelor of Technology degree, their offering, for Forensic crime, and cybersecurity option. Do you think this is the right path to take, and what are the job prospects?",

I can tell you that in my opinion a Bachelors of Tech or IT is significantly more relevant to cyber security then a BSc Comp Sci. A lot of certs in cyber security require 5 years experience before you can write them. For that reason getting a degree while working is a good option. The expectation before you get into security is 5 years in other IT domains or significant knowledge, dedication and evidence of drive in security. I am looking at the B.Tech: Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity for myself. I currently have a 3 year diploma from an Ontario College.",

            "comment": "Not really answering your questions as I don't know them... but...\n\nI completed the Advanced Certificate version of this program.  \n\nYou mention degree so I assume you're looking to do the bachelor's degree version. The bachelors degree version is the same courses as the Certificate version except you have like 9 extra credits for grad projects, bunch of extra credits in courses like Ethics and Reading and Writing, and in the certificate option you'd presumably choose either Cybersecurity or Forensics. But my point is, I've done a bunch of the technical courses including the \"advanced\" Digital Forensics 2 and Cybersecurity 2 courses...  \n\nAnd I think you're probably overqualified for this program based on the fact you already work in DFIR. I don't know what you actually do, but all the courses were relatively simplistic. The digital forensic courses were pretty much all just hours of learning how to use industry software like FTK, Autopsy, and EnCase. The cybersecurity courses, not very interesting. Cybersecurity Intro, or maybe 1, was like, learning Linux stuff mostly from what I remember. Cybersecurity 2 you did some messing with Kali Linux, had to do a report on some hacking tool. nothing extravagant. \n\nAlso the basic/intro courses - teachers had no idea what they were teaching. they were teaching blatantly incorrect information at times. Like that ARP stood for Auxiliary Resolution Protocol, and IP4v and IP6v protocols (yes that was not a typo on my part, they referenced IPv4 and IPv6 like that), that ports 25/80/443/etc are ephemeral ports, among other basic errors. \n\nSo ya... it might be a relatively easy degree for you. id pursue transfer credits and work experience for credit if you can get it. save yourself money.",

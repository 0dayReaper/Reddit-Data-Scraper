SFU could be an option but honestly, most MBA programs will require some kind of work experience and possibly managerial/supervisory experience too... Also, I was informed by program heads at BCIT, that they will be starting their own MBA program... however the details aren't fully disclosed to the public and are leaning towards not an MBA... here's a snippet of BCIT's wording on the program:\n\n\"This\u00a0master's degree will not be an MBA because our alumni already have the business administration background. The focus of this\u00a0master\u2019s will be on advanced business topics such as digital transformation, business sustainability, and innovation.\"",

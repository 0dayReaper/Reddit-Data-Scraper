I even emailed the International Office since I'm an international student to ask about my position in the waitlist but they tell me that they won't able to know where I am in the list. I got tired of waiting so I emailed the deparment head today. I think I should've talked to the CST department in the first place but I guess I'll either wait little bit more (maybe until the end of October) or just choose different school.",

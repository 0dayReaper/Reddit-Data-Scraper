    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have just been accepted into Langara's nursing program for their January intake. I'm debating between accepting Langara's offer or BCIT. I am leaning towards Langara as my fianc\u00e9 goes to UBC, so the commute would be a little easier, but I want to hear from some feedback from the community first. Can any students or graduates of either program tell me what your experience is like?",

So I'll be applying to Langara later this year, and I know they use a 4.3 scale but I'm doing my pre reqs at BCIT right now and don't know how they calculate GPA. If BCIT was on a 4.0 scale, would my grades be on a 4.3 scale when I transfer the classes to Langara?",

Also with bcit they offee the extra training you would need if you want to get into any specialties.\n\nI'm going to langara because it's closer to where I live and also because bcit required more prerequisites. But if you've already gotten into both I would go with what is most convenient for you. I've heard from nurses that it doesnt really matter what school you go to, after you graduate and actually start working as a nurse it's all the same.",

They have simulation labs which basically mimic hospital rooms and are pretty high tech. Term 1 clinicals are in nursing homes so you're not thrown into nursing action immediately. The nursing theory courses felt a little disorganized to me; you're not told explicitly what you need to pass the exams, and 1/3 of class time is dedicated to concept mapping to link ideas together. But they do say that BCIT has the highest NCLEX pass rate. Good luck on your application!!",

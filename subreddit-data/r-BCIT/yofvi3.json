    "postText": "Im taking part time evening classes and getting nervous with my final exam in 2 weeks. Each week's assignments are due midnight on sunday. I'm too tired from work and bus to do them until saturday, and I keep getting bad mental blocks. I step away and take breaks but I get diminishing returns each time. I'm just wearing out faster than I can get through the material, then bam it's overdue. Coffee doesn't help because i'm not sleepy, I can't think. I'm gonna try studying on the bus by drowning out everything else with white noise. Is there anything else I can do?",

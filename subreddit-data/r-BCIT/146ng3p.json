    "postText": "I\u2019m applying for advanced entry into the HR program. I\u2019ve emailed the program head a month ago on May 4 about applying and she sent me an intake form to fill out, which I sent back the same day. She then said she\u2019d talk to admissions about my application to see what she could do. Two weeks passed by, and I didn\u2019t hear from her. I emailed again on May 20th to follow up and she responded on the 22nd to say she would contact admissions to see if she could get me an answer by the end of the week. I heard nothing. I had emailed her on June the 7th to follow up again. No answer yet. I\u2019m not really sure what to do next since she\u2019s not answering\u2026I need to know in case I have to take any courses this summer, some of which have started. I was giving her time because it was the end of the semester and I figured she\u2019s very busy but it\u2019s been more than a month now. Does admissions take this long? Who should I talk to next? Any advice appreciated! I really want to get into this program. Thank you!",

But I talked to another program head in the same scenario (I inquired about two programs) and admissions has already got back to her and that was like 2 weeks ago. Should I talk to admissions first myself before escalating?",

I\u2019d say my time at ubc was 75% fun while bcit was maybe\u20262% fun haha. No exaggeration. \n\nOther than working in a small set (your assigned group of people for your length of study - this can be very good or very bad for you depending on the set), there is virtually zero socialization at bcit. The pub closes at 4pm. There is nowhere to go sit down to eat or drink within walking distance. Even the architecture at bcit is lifeless haha. \n\nI did make friends at bcit but they were only with a few set mates and often revolved around our shared experience of suffering lol. The courses are more intense (think 6-8 classes a term) and less self-directed (for my program I had no say over my class schedule) meaning you have less time/energy to form connections as you can\u2019t pace yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a quintessential university experience with a social life/parties/extracurriculars don\u2019t go to bcit. With that being said, if you want a technical job right out of graduation, it\u2019s a good place to suffer through to meet that end.",

My best friend is doing this right now and he has great relationships with the people in his program. If you're a part-time student (like me) you'll meet a lot of people in your various classes from different programs and walks of life. \n\n**TLDR:** Just be friendly and introduce yourself to people.

It's not like highschool or other colleges where you change people every class - you are stuck with the same group. On one hand, my best friend and I had every class together for 4 years. On the other hand, people I did not like as much I also had every class with for the full time.\n* Studying wise, you can get some socializing if you hangout and chat with people, especially in peer tutoring. But it's usually a small community that changes every year\n* Residency wise in the co-ed dorms was really fun. Nothing too crazy, school focused groups still. But it was nice to have so many get togethers, meet people in different programs, and make friends. Residency was definitely my favourite part socially of BCIT\n* Sports is pretty meh. We have no real teams, but there are intramural sports.  If they do it for a sport you like, you could meet people there. But its pretty bad at BCIT compared to sports at other schools.\n* The bar is mid. Now I'm not a hard partier so I found it a good atmosphere to have a drink and get some food after class, but it's not a club or anywhere near it. Don't expect dancing, just expect more like a restaurant you can socialize at\n* There are no sororities or frats, just clubs\n\nYou don't go to BCIT to socialize, you go between it's a great way to learn fast, or learn real world skills. That doesen't mean you can't enjoy it, I had a great time. But you will have to look for the socializing, you won't just fall into it",

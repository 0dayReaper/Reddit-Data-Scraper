What is going on with this program? Is the skills for this program not suitable for the job market? \n\nI got some friends from CIT and CST programs and they both get job before they graduate this year. It looks like those two program are more promising for the future.",

            "comment": "Since some of the answers aren't really much help but to rag on the program itself. I am a 2nd year CISA program student and just finishing up. The job market is not related to the program itself because (hello, we're in a recession) that's not indicative of whole experience. Honestly, that's BCIT promising that shit.   \n\n\nOverall, it's entirely what you make of it. I know some people who are hard-working who study and do everything and they get what they want. It really boils down to your own habits. It's a LOT of work especially if you're new to IT in general and if you have bad study habits, guess what, you get bad marks. The teachers are all reasonably fair except for a handful that are just piss poor with content, availability, and overall motivation for the subject.   \n\n\nAlso, most of the work you can find online along with tests but again, it's how you learn from it. I do like the aspect of the routine and making friends (since you're in a cohort and you are with the same people for the whole program). Don't be shy to say what you don't know and some of the teachers do help you get a job (with their connections). The program is great but these things are entirely up to how YOU see fit.",

If you like IT and want to explore the different aspects of the field such as networking, linux, microsoft... and you don't necessarily want to focus too much on coding then this program is as good as it gets. As someone that is coming from working in retail for a number of years, I am really glad I found it.",

This year seems harder though and means getting the foot in the door is going to be more important than being picky.

However, anyone without self discipline and has trouble studying and learning on their own may have issues. It's a two-year program that should realistically be a 3 or 4 year one so information will be thrown at you relentlessly with little time to absorb it. To get the most out of the instructors, you need to read and learn ahead of what is being taught so you can ask questions about things you are not sure about. The instructors are all very knowledgeable but will not explain much if not directly asked. This gets worse in year two. In addition, while all instructors are experienced people in IT, some are not great at the actual \u201cteaching\u201d part of being a teacher so learning things on your own is not a suggestion but a requirement.",

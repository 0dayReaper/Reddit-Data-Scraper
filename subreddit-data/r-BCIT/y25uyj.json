( reading slides plus listening to voice record is the fastest way to study for exams)\n\n- get into good groups for group assignments. Identify slackers and avoid them at all costs. \n\n- go to office hours for tough assignments. instructors will give you help and make your life infinitely easier\n\n- get enough sleep during final exam season.",

It is important for your sanity to put time aside to rest and relax. Common tactic is to grind all the homework on lets say saturday and chill on sunday but it depends on you. Good scheduling helps.",

It was popular enough to have around 55 students entering it on day 1.\n\nI think 35-37 graduated - and this included 7 students entering the program in the second year.\n\nSo, in short, it was super easy to enter. But, pretty hard to survive.\n\nThe concepts are not hard. It is just the volume of work thrown at you that makes it challenging. Don't take it too seriously. **Show up everyday on time with your work submitted and slowly study for tests starting five days out.** If you can manage this, you will be ok. \n\nTrust me it is worth it. This program will land you a sweet job.",

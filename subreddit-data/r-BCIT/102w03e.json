    "postText": "I applied for CIT around 3rd week of December. Just wondering how long it normally takes, because I already have a conditional offer from Douglas College (which I applied for same day as BCIT) but I have to pay 1st term fees by Jan 29. I didn't expect to get an offer so quickly, so now I don't know if I can wait for the CIT results. \n\nAppreciate the help. Thanks!",

It\u2019s competitive entry so they wait until the first deadline which will be March 1st to assess the top candidates. \n\nIf you end up wanting to transfer into SFU for example, I\u2019d accept the Douglas offer. Douglas is great for transferring, but a two year diploma at BCIT will be much better than Douglas 2 year diploma in CSIS for example. So it\u2019s really up to what you\u2019re looking for in terms of education",

I think cybersecurity is a field that you typically get into midway through an IT career so I don\u2019t know how much a diploma in that will help",

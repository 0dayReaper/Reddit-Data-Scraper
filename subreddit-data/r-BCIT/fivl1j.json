I stayed late in class because I didn't have the setup at home, and I'm glad now that BCIT is moving online. I scanned my textbooks into PDF form and shared it in my class group chat cuz everyone else left their textbooks at school.",

It's all about minimizing in-person exposure while maintaining the integrity of education with minimal delay. \n\nAll grad research is business as usual at UBC on-campus. Naturally, all bio-med research is business as usual in the labs on campus (imagine playing with viruses at home...).",

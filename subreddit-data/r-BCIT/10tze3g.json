    "postText": "I know this isn't a solely BCIT question, but I am just genuinely curious. and I know this question but sound stupid but I just wanna know.\n\nfor context, I finished highschool last year and I'm currently taking a gap year while taking BCST1160 so that I can do the full time course for television and video production (BCST1120), I'm already accepted into the full time course that runs for 2 years and since I am interested in pursuing film as a career, my old film teacher from high school highly recommended I study finance and business as well. so I was planning on finishing my 2 year course from BCIT and then applying to UBC commerce afterwards. I checked the requirements online and I have them completed but my concern is, when I apply to UBC do I apply as a \"highschool graduate\" ? I know there's technically no other option, but is that an option I can do, or not? I wanna ask my friends who go to UBC but unfortunately they're the type of people to ridicule you when you're asking questions like this so I'm hoping someone here can hear me out.",

As BCIT's courses don't transfer easily, my guess is that you would have 0 to 6 transferrable credits which means your admission average is based on your high school grades only. \n\nOn a side note, this is a question you definitely want to also ask UBC admissions directly (if you haven't already) and not rely on random people online. You might also get more responses by asking in the [/r/ubc admissions megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/q44oiu/new_to_campus_megathread_post_all_your_admissions/) as it's a significantly larger subreddit.\n\nAlso there's nothing stupid or worth being ridiculed over about your question.",

            "comment": "BCIT is a technical institute, so usually a diploma isn't fully transferrable to a University like UBC. It does transfer to a handful of other colleges but not always for UBC. [BCtransferguide.ca](https://BCtransferguide.ca) shows it clearly. \n\nFor your specific film program, I don't know which one you're talking about as they're tons of programs at BCIT that has to do with Media, but these programs are specialized programs that will train you to do whatever that program sets to. I am assuming you have already read the explanation and summary before you applied.\n\nThat being said, if you are looking to transfer that specific diploma, I think for sure you can't as a whole. So you will be applying as an adult with a highschool diploma. If you're thinking of applying after and getting advanced placement, that is a long road and you most likely won't transfer much if not, any courses. \n\nLastly, do you know why specifically your highschool teacher recommended you to head to UBC for Commerce? It is way different from television and film production. He said specifically Finance right? That is a major you choose later on. Those graduates, usually become advisors, accountants, etc. It is very broad. \n\nP.S. - Don't be afraid to ask more questions. You can ask your friends the same questions as well, if they make fun of you, just let them know you're serious and want to know. If they don't know, they don't know. If they say you're supposed to know, then screw them. That just shows they're not your friends. Good luck and keep researching. Do not go do a program because someone told you. Read the description carefully and look at the graduation outcomes on the home page of the program you applied to. It will show you what jobs their graduates have.",

If you want the UBC name, there are film programs there, and you can do a minor in commerce during the degree program.",

            "comment": "Best answer you'll get is by emailing UBC or calling them and asking directly. The truth is this generally is different based on the program.\n\nI know if you do CST, you can continue to the BTech at BCIT with full equivalency. If you transfer to SFU, you have 3 years left, basically only 1 year of BCIT is transferable. If you got to UBC, you have 3.5 years left, basically one semester was transferable - and you have to fight to get that semester.\n\nThis differs from program to program though, best bet is to call UBC and ask directly. That said, as someone who took the BTech, I would recommend just staying at BCIT if they have a bachelor option for your program. Loved my time at BCIT, learned a lot, and magically after graduating I have not had a single person ever question my university. I work in the states now and graduating from BCIT had no affect on the interviews or my work visa, it met the checkmark on my resume and that's all anyone ever cared about.\n\nSo I recommend doing the schooling that is best for your education, your wallet and your timeline. Not just picking a school for the reputation. But that's just my 2 cents",

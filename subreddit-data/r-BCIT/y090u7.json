When you have external pressure and no other choice, you go way beyond what you thought you could ever do.\n\nI know it sucks, but once you \"embrace the suck\" you'll get off on the work. And once you go through something truly difficult, the rest of your life becomes a game",

From personal experience, I recomend that you get a calender and right down what is due when and then work on whatever is due first. I also found it helpful to keep a list on my phone as I found I would be stressed about school in settings where school shouldn't affect me and looking at my phone and seeing the list layed out and organized helped me a bit.\n\nBut overall, just get help from your peers and dont be so hard on yourself. Take it one step at a time. Reward yourseld and manage your time better. We're half way through the semester and feel free to message me if you need to talk to someone.",

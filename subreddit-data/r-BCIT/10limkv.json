It takes longer, is more hassle(scheduling), and is more expensive however, unless you're going for a fairly short program.\n\nIf you want to start part time with CST, then move to full time after a bit(when you can show you can meet the requirements if you have doubts atm), you can transition to full time part way through.\n\nhttps://www.bcit.ca/courses/cst-laddered-credential-delivery-in-part-time-studies/\n\nI went PTS because it was all I could afford, took that for a bunch of years, was able to pay and got financial assistance finally, was fed up with PTS nonsense, and switched to full time to complete my degree.",

            "comment": "If you're taking one or two courses, you are generally allowed to take anything you want. Usually for level 1000 or 2000 courses. Once you get into 3000 they may check if you have the skills to qualify. It depends on the class.\n\nIn general you won't get into a problem unless the class you chose is very popular. BCIT usually advises you to choose a part-time program (a certificate or associate certificate) program that your course completes. And go from there. That way, they can advise you to choose which course and when. But of course you'll have to pay $90 (the last time I checked) to be registered in whatever part time program you want to be in.\n\nGiven it is CST, you have many options. You can start with CSC. Or you can even start with the associate certificates such as ASD. The program head is the same, so he may tell you to do the CSC program and then do CST.",

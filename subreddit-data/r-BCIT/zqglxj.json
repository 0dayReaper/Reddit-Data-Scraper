I am not from English country and really bad in English. and I would like to take some English course to improve it.\n\nShould I take an upgrading course from BCIT such as COMM 0005 or IELTS course from other school?",

If you are from one of those countries that have a reputation for STEM excellence, I wouldn't bother with studying unless you are bored.

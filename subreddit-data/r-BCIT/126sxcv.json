So I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on the move from Edmonton to Vancouver, how BCIT in in general as a school, and how the BBA program is there, as I would probably go there if I did move.",

Just finish up at NAIT and then move to BC once you\u2019re ready for your career. Unless you\u2019re loaded.. then yolo I guess haha",

They assume you have taken the standard set of business classes that all BCIT diplomas include.  BCIT diplomas are mostly a set block of classes.  You don't pick 3 or 4 per semester.  You take 7-8 per semester.  Those diplomas are like a full time job then it lightens up the load in the BBA back to 4 courses.\n\nNote sure if the NAIT diplomas include those courses or if they qualify as transfer credit.",

All evening in-person classes and exams are cancelled \u2013 including full and part-time classes. We ask all students, staff, and faculty to safely make their way off campus.\n\nIf your class or work is available online, this closure does not impact you. Please log in remotely in accordance with your usual schedule.\n\nStudents who were scheduled to be on campus will receive communications from their instructor for directions on today\u2019s classwork.\n\nFaculty and staff who were scheduled to be on campus will receive communications from their manager or support person for directions on today\u2019s work. Those that are able to work remotely should do so.\n\nWe continue to monitor the weather and will provide a new update on campus conditions by 5:30 am, tomorrow, February 28, at bcit.ca/breakingnews.",

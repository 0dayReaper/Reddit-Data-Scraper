            "comment": "To be honest, your best bet is to ask a program advisor directly as they have the most insight on admission averages. \n\nJust roughly speaking, your Foundations of Math is roughly equivalent to  92% Pre-Calculus 12, and your IELTS 7.0 is roughly English 12 73%, then your average is 83%. That might be a bit low if the other international applicants have high averages. You ideally want a high 80%s average to be safe.",

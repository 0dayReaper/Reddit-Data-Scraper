    "postText": "I have a three year bachelor degree in Liberal Arts. I initially wanted to do a Masters Program from Canada but I do not meet the requirements. I have two goals: (1) Get a (decently) high paying design/tech job in Canada, most probably a UI/UX Designer, and (2) Get Canadian PR. \n\nI feel as though doing the Digital Design and Development Diploma at BCIT may be a good stepping stone to achieving both of those goals. I would hopefully be able to get a job and work for three years in Canada, and then ideally apply to a Master\u2019s program at a top Canadian University, after the completion of which I could apply for PR. \n\nDo you guys think this plan makes sense? Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you.",

As someone who also applied for PR - I found the process relatively straightforward especially for people who are on a PGWP after finishing a post secondary program, since the PGWP is only for 3 years at most (should one\u2019s program be 2 years or longer) - and most people I know apply for PR after 1 year of fulltime work experience. I stated my comment because your initial comment made it sound like 3 years of work is mandatory when in reality, a large number of people qualify after one year of full time work but now I\u2019m realizing you said three years as an example in reference to OP\u2019s post , as you said, so I apologize for these long winded comments!

So I think you should be okay without a masters. Also the career you're choosing is more about practical experience versus credentials. ui/ux is the creative side of tech and I think a good portfolio will take you further in your career than a masters degree. \n\nIn my past life I did graphic design and it's 100% portfolio-based. I had friends who went really far in their careers with just a BCIT certificate in that field. \n\nWish you the best of luck and always reach out here of you have any other questions.",

You will get a course to prep resumes cover letters and interview skills while applying to co-ops. Prepare to work to get a high 80s average in term 1 to get in.",

They take all the applicants, sort by GPA in the first semester, and take the top 30. I think I had an 82% in the first semester on average.\n\nThere was no interview.\n\nIf you want to know about it, contact them:\n\n[https://www.bcit.ca/workplace-education/work-experience-programs/co-op-programs/computer-information-computer-systems-technology/](https://www.bcit.ca/workplace-education/work-experience-programs/co-op-programs/computer-information-computer-systems-technology/)\n\nAs for my experience, I did 8 months as a web developer at HSBC. I learned a lot, but did not particularly enjoy the position. I made $17 an hour, which at the time was more than I'd ever made. I bought a lot of nice things over those 8 months. Towards the end of my coop time they really screwed me over.\n\nI did semester 3 classes part time during my coop, and that made third semester a lot easier.",

If you qualify, you submit an application to the faculty then you go through a meeting that will give you a rundown of what the process would be like. Generally, there will be a search portal that will give you the approved coop opportunities, but you could also look them up independently. What might help is to reach out to people at the company directly",

In terms of school, you basically submit an online application form, the program will take your GPA and compare it to the rest of the applicant pool of that term. It usually takes place at the end of the first term. At this stage there are no interviews. After being accepted into co-op, it\u2019s very much like applying for a full time job. You need to submit resumes and cover letters to companies and wait to be shortlisted to get into an interview.\n\nMy GPA was above 90%. I had my projects listed on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, including the ones from school, from hackathons, and some personal projects.\n\nDomestic.\n\nI am three months into co-op, my experience has been pretty good. Luckily, I got a developer job instead of IT job or analyst job (not that they\u2019re bad, it\u2019s just not what I strive for). Things have been challenging but also rewarding.",

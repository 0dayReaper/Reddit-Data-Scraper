    "postText": "Im currently a student studying at sfu in health science who has not been really happy. I have a lot of rants about sfu. I came across some programs at bcit and the medical lab tech program seems to stand out to me.  I have all the pre reqs from high school except for physics. Am I able to use my high school grades requirements  and physics credit from sfu towards admissions? If so, how can I do that?",

I applied and was accepted using my high school marks that were over 6 years and marks from SFU (English and bio marks). For me I just entered in the highest marks whether it was from high school or SFU. So pick the higher grades whether its from high school or SFU. It says upgrading is preferred on their site but its **not required** they don't really care as I remember from an info session. In your application, it will ask you the specific course that satisfies each of the subjects so for you just input your HS marks for all of them and the physics SFU mark and upload both transcripts.",

If they are not valid, you can try checking if you have taken an equivalent courses at sfu which is listed on the program page. If you do not have either, you can try registering to \"burnaby online\" and repeat the course you need at your leisure while you wait for the next medlab intake.",

    "postText": "I am currently a 3rd year UBC student majoring in Sociology and I want to apply to the sonography program in the next few years. On the BCIT website it says that you should have experience working with people. Due to my major not being science related I think I will probably need to find a job in the healthcare field (clinic receptionist, clinic screener, or medical office assistant) and I am having a hard finding such jobs because I don't have any experience in healthcare. I have applied to so many jobs and gone to a few interviews by I have always gotten an email saying they have hired someone with experience. I am in the process of starting to volunteering at a seniors home as an activity volunteer, which I believe will good to have on my resume but I am still looking for a job. Does anyone know if I need a job in healthcare since the website says has experience working with people or can it be any Jobe where I work with people? the phrase \"working with people\" seems pretty vague, so I am a bit confused.",

Being able to show that you have customer service experience, volunteer experience with direct patient access, and something that says you've proven an ability to work with people in a one-on-one setting is basically required. \n\nAs a sonographer you will have access to very sensitive information before anyone else essentially (death of a fetus, undiagnosed cancer, severe undiagnosed heart disease). If you have a history of one-on-one customer service/patient interaction it will give them some evidence that you can be put in a hospital setting with these difficult circumstances and be able to handle it.\n\nIf you're someone who doesn't like the idea of a lot of one-on-one patient encounters, I wouldn't recommend sonography.",

I have worked in customer service since high school and recently started volunteering at my local hospital with a 1 year commitment. I\u2019ve only done around 40 hours so far and but I was accepted. I definitely don\u2019t believe it has to be healthcare related, but if you\u2019re looking for something in a healthcare setting I would definitely recommend hospitals or like you said you\u2019re beginning at a seniors home and I\u2019m sure they would like any aspect of working with people in the community.",

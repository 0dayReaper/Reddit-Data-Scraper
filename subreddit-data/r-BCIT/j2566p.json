    "postText": "I don\u2019t know if anyone noticed but people seem to be more open to being toxic/disrespectful online. (This should have been expected, as online/internet culture is generally a lot less restrained - we\u2019re all hiding behind screens after all).\n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll see this, but I just wanted to say \u201cThank you\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d to the professors who have to deal with our (sometimes very stupid and disrespectful) attitudes.\n\nThis is also a message to other students to try to remember to treat these classes like you\u2019re still in person (but also take advantage of the good side of being online -- less anxiety to speak up and ask questions in the chat if you\u2019re an introvert like me). \n\nIn this sense its also less scary and much easier to start disrespecting people, and you forget you would never speak this way to a professor/student in person. The feelings in our words don\u2019t really get through on both sides in the same way in person versus online (even with cameras on). Even in text chat, you may sound sarcastic or disrespectful without intending to.\n\nPlease remember that we\u2019re all still humans even though our classes are online and be kind to each other. \n\nWe\u2019ll get through this together.\n\nMuch love!\n\nSigned,\nA random student drowning in work but still wanting to get this message out because I think people need to see this and if it even helps change the attitude of a single person I have done my job.",

There are plenty of different instructors, some have earned renown and respect in their programs, and some are still new and building on these things.\n\nHowever, I also feel that it goes both ways in the case of being petty and arrogant. We're all humans and we all have flaws. I think learning to accept these flaws in each other and communicating these things with each other in a respectful manner is what grown adults like us should do, no? \n\nYes, I also agree that we do have the responsibility to call out our elders when they are in the wrong, it is a good learning opportunity especially in a safer environment such as school, to learn to stay respectful while pointing these things out. \n\nUnfortunately in the work place I don't believe being disrespectful while calling out those above you would be accepted... and would most likely have unwanted consequences.\n\nMy main point is, pointing out your instructors errors when they are incorrect or doing something that you and your classmates feel is wrong is not disrespectful at all! But the manner in which you do so is important and a skill that students need to practice even in this online environment.",

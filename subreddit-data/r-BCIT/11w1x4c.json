In addition it also works when I applied for other schools. (I emailed the office of Ecu telling them that I will have my English assessment next semester and they still send me an offer, so I guess they don't care also this that much.)",

If you\u2019re in the process of meeting that requirement (currently in grade 12 or taking a COMM class or waiting for your ECA results) you can apply, and you'll be given a provisional seat with a deadline to submit your final grade for full acceptance",

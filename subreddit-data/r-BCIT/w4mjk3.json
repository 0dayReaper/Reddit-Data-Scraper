    "postText": "I already got a bachelor's from SFU in cognitive science but did not take many upper division courses in computer science. I have the decision between these two certificates, which would be the better choice for me in terms of getting a job. I heard that web developers have the most jobs out of all developer types, so I am aiming for Applied Web Development; however,  Applied Software Developement can ladder into CST/PST, and then to Bachelors of Technology in Computing Systems. Can anyone give me any suggestions?",

            "comment": "I don't think the opportunity of getting a 2nd Bachelor's should factor in your decision.\n\nAt this point, you can take as many and as varied certificates and/or microcredentials to supplement your career track/resume. \n\nI'm four years into the tech industry, and three companies later, and nobody cares what degree I held (or lacked), as long as I can prove that I had experience or knowledge about the company's tech stack. That's where those certificates help.\n\nAs for ASD vs AWD, I found equal demand for web devs and software devs. But software dev roles are generally more straightforward, whereas companies tend to falsely expect their web devs to do EVERYTHING in their website.",

            "comment": "I did pretty much the entire AWD curriculum during CST (3 credits short), and have done ASD.  If you're serious about software development I would go ASD 100%.\n\nThe sorts of things you'll do in ASD\u2192ACIS\u2192CST will teach you to teach yourself anything you'll do in AWD, the reverse is not true.  Learning Node/Javascript and introductory SQL will not equip you to understand computer architecture or compiled languages.\n\nBut I'd question the desire to pay for more school at all if you've already got a bachelors degree.  There are 3-4 comp sci profs at BCIT that I'm glad to have paid for and would happily pay more, the remainder aren't really any different than YouTube or Udemy, in some cases it\u2019s worse.  That's especially the case if you've already got a strong maths background.",

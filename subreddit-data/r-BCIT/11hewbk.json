I'm thinking it might be a good idea to obtain a certificate and work for a while before pursuing further education.\nConsidering future employment and applying for higher education, which institution would be a better choice for me: VCC or BCIT?",

At the end of the day it's what you get out of the learning environment and how competent you are on the job that matters. If you can handle the workload, there's nothing wrong with BCIT. At the same time, there's nothing wrong with going to community college to see if you like the topic you are studying before committing more time and money.",

I took a few courses at VCC right almost right out of highschool and most of the instructors were garbage. To give you an idea: one made a song about the course material to the tune of Avril Lavigne Skater Boy and made us all sing along to it. It was bad, real bad. This was over 10 years ago though so hopefully they have a better line up of instructors now.",

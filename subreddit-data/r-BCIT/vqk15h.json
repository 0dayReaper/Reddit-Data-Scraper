You can use the [BC transfer guide](https://www.bctransferguide.ca) to look for block transfers or specific course transfers. Whatever you decide, this will help you with identifying what transfers (even to BCIT).\n\nFor example, you can do a 2 year diploma at some community colleges and transfer to Emily Carr for the degree. You'll receive 2 years worth of credits if you meet certain GPA requirements. Or you might consider going directly to a university. \n\nI'm not sure what employment opportunities are like in your field or what training employers prefer, but you can usually find out what grads do on the specific program website. You can also use LinkedIn to search by university or search by employer and work backwards.",

    "postText": "[Petition](http://chng.it/zLNTMvTLBf)\n\nHey everyone, due to the current situation regarding COVID-19 our program has started a petition to suspend in person instruction at BCIT. UBC also has a petition going, and Ivy League schools such as Harvard have already suspended theirs and moved to online instruction.\n\nYou may not be worried, of course, it is just a pretty hefty flu to most people. But there are many people with invisible diseases that compromise their immune system, and catching COVID-19 will likely end in fatality. Children and seniors are especially susceptible. Many BCIT students live with these people, from siblings, to parents, and especially grandparents. Even if you don\u2019t care about catching it, you should care about spreading it to the people you love. Vancouver is currently a hotbed for the virus and being in a close quarters post-secondary, our chances of catching it are quite high. Let\u2019s try to keep that as contained as possible, please sign if you agree! \n\n[Petition](http://chng.it/zLNTMvTLBf)",

Why is BCIT not following suit? Do they want to get sued? All it takes is one person to catch it at BCIT, and boom....negligence suit for not following provincial health guidelines.",

That is whole different can of worms because kids require guardians at home so if the schools close, the parents can't work, including some parents who are doctors and nurses and other healthcare staff. Not that we shouldn't also be closing grade schools as well, but my point is that it should be a no brainer for BCIT in comparison. \n\nI think the real issue is whether BCIT can actually deliver a valid education online since so much of it is hands on. What happens if they can't? Does everyone graduate without really completing the same education you would have in other years? Do they have to postpone the whole schedule including next year?

I think something that should be understood however is that this pandemic will st the very least likely last 6 months. Sure Spanish flu existed when we had worse technology and outreach, but we are much more globalized than we used to be and people travel far more than they used to. Furthermore I think there tends to be more distrust in government and science than there used to be so that'll be a challenge. (this last part is my own conjecture) \n\nI point this out not to disagree but just to note that it's kinda complicated and we need to be smart. \n\nBut do you have any articles on your third paragraph? I have not been able to find any and that sounds contradictory to how our immune system works and also the information Ive personally read (what I've read is that there are two strains of this, one is much less common but they diverged early on after animal to human transmission which is not uncommon to do. Other than that we have seen no evidence of mutation so far).",

You don't want cases going from 0 to 50% in a matter of weeks, since that would overload our hospitals. You want it to slowly rise to that number. Flattening the curve is critical to a country weathering this out.\n\nIf Coronavirus is to become permanent, our healthcare and hospital facilities will gradually be able to expand capacity to meet the permanent need. But until then, we need to delay the spread by taking actions like this, so that it's not an \"overnight overflow\" to our system. Same # of people infected in total, but vastly different results due to the speed of increase.\n\nHere's some [information](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fh06s2/what_flattening_the_curve_actually_looks_like/) on flattening the curve, and an easy to understand [image](https://twitter.com/TheSpinoffTV/status/1236726419608100864?s=20).\n\nChildren may not be individually at risk, but they are going to be amazing as carriers. Kids are disgusting - they touch everything and everyone and lick their fingers, hands, etc. They will undoubtedly catch it and pass it on to their parents, grandparents, etc. who are more vulnerable.",

Its doubling their work load... Not to mention now everyone who has to stay home is at a disadvantage just because they either don't want to die or dont want to infect people.\n\nAlso I just realized some potentially infected students won't self quarantine. They will come to school for fear of falling behind.",

In the meantime, wash, don\u2019t go to unnecessary gathering places on campus and make your own food to bring to school.\n\nEdit: downvote me all you want guys.  I don\u2019t touch things I shouldn\u2019t, I carry a tissue to deal with anything face related and I come home and hang out in my room not surrounding myself with other people.

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m looking on some clarification on the BCIT levels to receive a bachelors of engineering in electrical. I got accepted into the Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology diploma program and to my understanding, I\u2019ll be competing for the opportunity to become an engineer in first year. To add on, I\u2019d like to know what the process is even like for the selection. Some personal questions I have are: is it all based on GPA? how many seats there are? \nP.S. please add any other information you wish you knew before going through this process.",

To add, I should've taken courses or self taught myself as much coding and programming as possible. \nAlso, becoming comfortable with IC chips and breadboarding would've been great. \nMaybe teaching myself DC and AC circuit analysis too.",

You could also purchase a PLD, download quartus 2 and learn VHDL(digital techniques). \nMaybe after you're good with the things mentioned above, you can purchase a raspberry pi or learn Linux programming. \nIn terms of circuits, I could send you the notes for both DC and AC if you want.",

You're competing against first-year, ECET, mech, and biomedical diploma grads which means there are over 100 people per year that apply. If you don't get in the first year, you could always go the diploma route and get the 5% grade boost if you finish. However they will take into account your entire diploma grade instead of your first year marks.  \n\n\nHope that helps!",

Last time I heard, they changed the rules so that all 32 seats are open to diploma students.\n\nEdit: Each diploma program has around 32 seats as well though your class size might be smaller depending on the option you choose to take.",

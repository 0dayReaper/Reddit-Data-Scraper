            "comment": "I'm not aware of people getting kicked out of BCIT due to failing. Although I haven't taken GTEC, there are a few general principles that apply to all programs.\n\n\nIf it's cohort based, by failing a class you will likely not be able to take next semester's courses, if the one you failed is a prerequisite. This means you will be taking your diploma longer (unless you can do something in the summer, which depends on if a part-time course exists).\n\nIf you have a co-op program, usually failing a course automatically excludes you. I see there are job placement opportunities in GTEC, but you need to find out if you must pass all your courses to be eligible.\n\nA limit exists for course attempts, with only 3 attempts allowed. I believe the 3rd attempt requires approval from someone at BCIT, but the 2nd attempt doesn't need approval.\n\nGenerally speaking, failing courses doesn't mean you will be kicked out. It does mean, however, that you've extended the time you will need to graduate and may miss out on any co-op opportunities.",

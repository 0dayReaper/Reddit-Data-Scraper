    "postText": "I hold a BS in Computer Science from a US university but I don't have any professional or practical experience. My university focused on theory and concepts rather than application, and did not make co-ops/internships mandatory. Of course I still applied to a few, but no luck there. I have a good grasp on programming and programming concepts, but when it comes to application my head just goes blank. \n\nI heard good things about BCIT, specifically their job placement rates, and so I've considered doing the Applied Software Development certificate in hopes that it will give me some practical knowledge and experience I can apply in the \"real world.\" Is it worth investing in the courses outlined by the ASD certificate?",

Get a few years xp.\n\nIf you haven't had much actual programming experience in your CS degree, and instead were more focused on theoretical maths (which was not a great choice), then you'll probably find the ASD program pretty beneficial. \n\nBut if you know something deeper from your degree, it might be good to try to leverage that.",

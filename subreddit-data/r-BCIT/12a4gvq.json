Better grades dont really matter.\n\nSo, you need people ahead of you to drop out so you can get in.\nIn the meantime you can take that first physics course with equivalent from part time studies that will transfer and make your workload a bit lighter.",

Upgrading your pre-cal 12 and physics 11 mark will be critical in your success in the first semester of the program. The math courses and physics course build very quickly and substantially on your pre-requisite knowledge early in.\n\nOur intake lost the most amount of people after the first semester due to poor pre-requisite knowledge. Not saying that is the case with you, but would like to put everything upfront to help you make the best decision for you.",

So if you want to go with kpu then you gotta wait for the 2024 semester.\n\nIf you still want to go to mechatronics then try sfu as they have that program as well.",

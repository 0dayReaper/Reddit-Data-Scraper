            "comment": "It sort of depends on which diploma and what your skills are coming out of the diploma. \n\nI did the mechanical design option, but I really wasn't focused on learning AutoCAD and SolidWorks. This made it very difficult for me to end up in design jobs. I didn't, so I landed in manufacturing. \n\nA diploma is not an engineering degree, so you will definitely be kept out of a lot of jobs because you're not eligible for the P.Eng. Even if you don't need it, I've seen a lot of jobs requesting eligibility for it. The diploma leads to a technologist license(?), credential(?) I'm not sure the exact term. \n\nI think if you land in a design or systems (HVAC) job, you have the opportunity to grow into a project coordinator or project manager role or maybe manage a group of design technologists. I've seen a bunch of my classmates end up in sales or in city jobs. I think civil is better for city jobs, but you should be able to find some city jobs in maintenance or something similar (e.g., fire inspection) for mech. I know someone that ended up in construction project management. \n\nI don't really have a great sense of where all my classmates ended up, but you might be able to get a lot more info from the mech faculty when school starts. \n\nI think most people compare jobs against software and computer science degrees. Nothing comes close to touching the salaries or employment prospects with CS.",

Since I\u2019m international student I won\u2019t be able to complete my bachelors at BCIT unless completing my diploma here, get a job that enables me to pay the tuition. I also have another option which is going back to my native country and complete my bachelors there then apply for masters in Canada. What do think is the best?",

You'll need to have good grades and do some research to be able to get good references from profs to be eligible for a master's here. A thesis based master's should be free to you because you're going to be doing TA, RA, or some other type or work. \n\nI would make sure that people from the school in your country have actually been accepted and gone to Canada for grad school. Best would also be if the faculty at your school did their PhDs in Canada or the US. This way they will understand the system and possibly have colleagues they can recommend you to.\n\nIt might also be good to check with the appropriate engineering professional society in the province you intend to work in to make sure your undergrad degree is recognized. For example, in BC it's EGBC (engineers and geoscientists of BC). You may even be able to skip the master's degree assuming you are eligible for immigration or working here with your bachelor's. (I have no knowledge or insight into this.)\n\nThere used to be a list of non-accredited international schools that were recognized ([https://www.egbc.ca/getmedia/fe0bc20a-da22-4226-beb1-878769f0aa4f/List-of-Non-Accredited-Reputable-International-Programs-and-Degrees-(Sept-11,-2017).pdf.aspx](https://www.egbc.ca/getmedia/fe0bc20a-da22-4226-beb1-878769f0aa4f/List-of-Non-Accredited-Reputable-International-Programs-and-Degrees-(Sept-11,-2017).pdf.aspx)) but the list seems to be out of use now, so I think you'd need to contact EGBC to find out how you could confirm if your degree would be recognized. \n\nI was accepted into the engineering program at BCIT and elsewhere, but I had to keep working full-time to pay the bills. Engineering programs have minimum course and credit requirements to be eligible to stay in the program. I should have argued more and tried to find more work arounds, but I changed industries and finished an unrelated bachelor's degree. So, in my experience, trying to complete the degree while working isn't going to happen. \n\nIt might have changed, but when I did the design program, someone from manufacturing or from systems would need to go back and take 3 years to finish the degree. The degree at the time used design as the second year, so you may have a longer time to complete the degree if you study manu. It could have changed, though. \n\nElectrical engineering at BCIT has a BTech program that can be completed part-time and eventually lead to a P.Eng., but it's not easy and not straight forward from what I've heard.",

            "comment": "Ontario is a better job market for engineers/diploma holders for sure than BC, due to being close to the states and having their own manufacturing companies.\n\nThe job prospect for mechanics engineers is among the poorest in engineering disciplines in BC, I know someone who moved to Ontario to use their mechanical engineering degree. But for your case, having a diploma actually gives you better job prospects due to being lower on the pyramid. You just might have take a less ideal job.",

            "comment": "honestly, it really depends how passionate you are. \n\nyeah the design option won\u2019t teach you everything to know about Autocad and Solidworks but no other school really teaches a software program in-depth. if you are passionate enough however, you\u2019ll spend time creating your own projects in Solidworks for example and have no problem finding jobs with ur software skills and those projects to present. \n\nthe systems option is very neat as well. TONS of job opportunities if you are into HVAC (especially in bc). \n\ni\u2019m going into fourth year in the bachelor option in sept and my advice with that is if you got time to study 4 years just do it. (unless ur heart is dead set in the HVAC industry)\n\nlast thing, if ur in it for the money, to CS like the other person said",

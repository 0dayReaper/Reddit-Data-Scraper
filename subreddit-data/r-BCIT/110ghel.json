    "postText": "So I'm a recent International English graduate who took a keen interest in marketing, I saw the school's credentials and it seemed like an amazing choice to study in as opposed to the \"diploma mills\" as some of the folks I've seen put it like UoW Pace, Fashawa or Conestoga. My question however is, should i apply to a full time diploma here or is it a waste of time because i already have a BD ? My reasoning is that I think the diploma itself is not Post-Grad as opposed to the programs offered by the schools i mentioned. So employers might see that as me having the equivalent of two Bachelor's degree, or maybe even less . I guess I'm just wondering if this program is the right choice for someone who isn't fresh out of high school. I'm hoping to get some opinions and perspective! :)",

And what bachelor did you do if you don\u2019t mind me asking ? \n\nI did my bachelor\u2019s in English Studies , and while I have no regrets doing it as the experience and the lessons it taught me both in life and academic values were worth it . I\u2019m just scared that my portfolio will pale in comparison to the many younger talented individuals who\u2019s also making their way into the industry. \n\nBut regarding BCIT , I\u2019m hoping that having a bachelor\u2019s will offer me some advantage in the admission . But ngl i feel super anxious applying this late.",

With that said, marketing jobs can be so broad you could potentially land a job with just your degree, and learn as you go?",

I expect the diploma to be infinitely more useful than my degree career-wise but I\u2019ll have to get back to you on that",

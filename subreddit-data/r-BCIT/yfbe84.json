My portfolio showcased some of my best drawings ranging from different styles of art and apparently that was enough to get accepted. It took a week and a half for them to get back to me but I was waitlisted for over a month until there was an open seat. \n\nShow some things about your portfolio that makes you different from everyone and expect a long wait from them when it comes for a response",

What I did for my portfolio was put in my 10 best drawings and added brief descriptions underneath them describing the process and inspiration behind it. After that, it was a whole wait and approval from there. Process took them about a week and a half until I got a message back saying that I was accepted into the program.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think you have to worry about any Portfolio interview unless they said anything about it in the future intakes. I highly recommend that you apply early because I am very lucky that I was able to get into the January intake and getting a available spot after being waitlisted over a month.",

Does each piece have to be a different style? Cause I've done portraits of people I know, some anime pieces and some of my original work (recent drawing) if there's anything that you can suggest to add, also I don't have the physical copy of some of the old pieces I've done since I moved around a lot but I have the electronic copy of them, will it be a problem if I included that in the portfolio?",

You could really choose whatever you want to show in your portfolio! Remember it is completely yours to decide what goes in it.\n\nI applied the Jan intake pretty late actually, it\u2019s a miracle that I got in the first place so I recommend please doing it as early as possible! \n\nSome side notes, they aren\u2019t actually checking how good your style of art work is. They just want to see the effort you put in it.\n\nI am currently attending the program right now and my classmates made a discord channel showcasing what they added into theirs and some of them used some photography, things they constructed in real life or even 3D models they made using YouTube tutorials!\n\nSome reassurance, don\u2019t be too scared, you\u2019re most likely getting in if you apply the intake early. It doesn\u2019t matter how long ago you made your art piece or anything, they will most likely accept it.\n\n\nHave you had any Maya background before? \n\nIf not, don\u2019t worry I didn\u2019t when I first started. I didn\u2019t even know what Maya was but they will teach you perfectly! We won\u2019t use blender at all.",

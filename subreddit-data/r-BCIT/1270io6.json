            "comment": "I wouldn't recommend BCIT FSWD program. There are far too many unnecessary courses, and a good number of the instructors lack the necessary skills. For domestic students, it costs $18,000, but in all honesty, the quality of education is only worth about $8,000 at best. The courses are quite intense, and there isn't enough opportunity for practice or hands-on coding. They tend to inundate you with a lot of heavy assignments without providing enough code demonstrations. The classes themselves are held four days a week, from 9-5, and the homework loads are so substantial that it's challenging to find the time to work outside of school.Additionally, I would like to highlight that it's a scam when they claim that you don't need a coding background to enroll in the BCIT FSWD program. While it may be true that they accept students without a coding background, it puts those individuals at a significant disadvantage, as the program moves at an incredibly fast pace, assuming that students have at least some prior knowledge in the field. Overall, I strongly advise against enrolling in this program, as it's overpriced and under delivers in terms of education and training.",

CIT is geared towards those that want to be a well-rounded IT professional (ie: DevOps).  It covers web development, system admin, networking, database, etc.  You get breadth, not depth.",

            "comment": "Ayy! I took this program a couple years ago, class of 2020. Eamonn (program instructor) is a blessing and a wonderful person. Your carpenter experience will be useful when drawing details for sure. Get a solid foundation in your AutoCAD skills as they help build on for your Revit course in the new year. You\u2019ll have manual drafting courses in the fall and transition to AutoCAD afterwards. For your assignments I highly recommend trying to get stuff done at school before going home for the day. Classes are 7am-1:30pm so get used to waking up early. Lot Q in front of NE1 fills up fast so get there early for a spot. There\u2019s a microwave in the classroom so you don\u2019t need to fight the cafeteria warzone lineup.\n\nYou will be provided your own workstation with 2 monitors and a drafting table. You can bring your own laptop if you want or just use the provided one.\n\nGood luck! ASCT was a huge help for me when I applied into ABT the year after. It gave me 3 courses of transfer credit and familiarized me with the industry.",

            "comment": "I took the program back in 2014 so I will try to offer a few things. \n\n1. treat it like a job. (8 to 5) basically. Thats what I and some other folks that were retraining did. I took Structural option (more money at the time, not sure how much now), and classes often ended early, and people that were serious about the career would put in extra time whether it be for math, engineering design, cad or revit. They ended program successfully while a bunch dropped out. \n2.  I would also suggest desktop with dual monitors vs laptop. it will be helpful once you get a job, and they will most likely allow hybrid once you prove yourself/pass probation. wfh with proper set up is miles better than laptop, since your work will most likely have dual monitors and you wouldnt have to buy anything extra to replicate work settings at home. \n3.  if you study/work hard, you will likely get a job before graduation, towards the middle/ end of the program, companies will reach out, and/or your instructor will post jobs in the classroom or sometimes even instructor will have connections. if you do well, and have the teachers endorsement, you will be able to land a job before completing the program. there may be better ones out there ,but at least you will get your foot in the door without any gap. \n\nnot sure what else is there, feel free to comment if you have more questions and good luck with your program.",

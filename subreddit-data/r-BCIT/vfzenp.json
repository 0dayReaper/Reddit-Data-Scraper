How do I know via the website if it has gone through? I can see on the \"account balance and summary\" page that I have the amount I paid next to \"tuition &amp; other payments held for future release\" does this mean it went through? Thanks in advance\n\nUpdate: It does show on the website! Next to \"tuition and other payments held for future release\" you should see the fee amount.",

If your worried about being late for the deadline for the commitment fee you should go in person to the Bcit Burnaby campus and talk to the office registar\u2026I was late for my commitment fee and was awfully worried about being denied entry into a tech program which I worked really hard to get into to. From my experience, If you go down there in person it puts a name to a face and shows your dedication and \u201ccommitment\u201d to the program. Worked for me! Take with a grain of salt but if your really stressed about it. That was my solution. Cheers and goodluck!",

I was looking around for an alternative and found this program.\n\nI wounder if the demand for this is high or not in Vancouver as the internet claims theirs alot of demand but their primary based on the US. I want to hear your thoughts on this, Thanks for your help!",

They just don't need the ticket out here. \n\nBuilding operations is moderately in demand but the problem is other options are better in terms of money. I recommend you go for plumbing or HVAC.\n\nLots of my ex classmates did p&amp;p and lots ended up in building ops or hospital work.\n\nThis type of question comes up a lot and honestly The career trajectory of other programs are better in terms of money and wfh ability.\n\nAny questions let me know, p&amp;p had a lot of hopium sprinkled into it from the instructors and that's what it was.",

Suffice to say that power and process is not what you are looking for.\n\nOnce again I highly recommend looking into the trades of plumbing and HVAC. You are reliably able to make money from the get go and will make leaps and bounds more than an engineer likely can (mostly unless you become a principal engineer or run your own business even then though...)\n\nIf I could choose again I would have chosen plumbing, HVAC or an IT related thing like system administration.",

            "comment": "P&amp;P grad here. (10 years ago)\n\nBuilding operations/maintenance is criminally underrated. Starting salaries vary wildly, anywhere from $40k-$80k. Most of your work will seem very menial (fixing doors, painting, etc.), but if you can put up with that, the future opportunities are much broader, with more potential to match or even surpass plant operation salaries. \n\nOnce you \u201cmove up\u201d in building operations, your opportunities and quality of life (in my opinion) far surpasses plant work. (E.g. No shift work, an actual social life at work, getting to meet new people, freedom to go out for lunch, networking, events, potential adjacent opportunities, etc.). There is no shortage of local work for this side of things. \n\nCompared to plant operations, which starts at high salaries of $100k+, but your future opportunities are limited to whatever the company/union has set. You typically have shift work, can\u2019t leave the plant, work with the same people, etc. Whether or not that\u2019s worth it to you simply depends on your goals. \n\nLocal demand for this side is relatively low compared to buildings, but once you\u2019re in, you\u2019ll jump straight into a 6-figure salary. \n\nI went the building operations route and I\u2019m very glad that I did.",

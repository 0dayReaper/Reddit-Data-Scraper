            "comment": "Hi,\n\nI am a graduate of the AME program. BCIT has a prerequisite for this program, you can check it out here: [https://www.bcit.ca/programs/aircraft-maintenance-engineer-category-m-maintenance-diploma-full-time-1230dipma/#entry](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/aircraft-maintenance-engineer-category-m-maintenance-diploma-full-time-1230dipma/#entry)\n\nIf your English grade is from G12 year, you are well set to go. Just make sure you score more than 75% on the Mechanical Reasoning Test, which is nothing more than basic mathematics and physics questions.\n\nI recommend, however, that before you apply to this course, investigate the current state of aviation in Canada. Compare different job offers from employers. Maybe go to ATC campus and chat with Laurie. Remember, your time spent in training will deduct 18 mo from the total required experience for apprenticeship, which is 48 mo in total. Transport Canada established the conversion rate of 1 mo of credit for 150 working hours (apprenticeship), and permit you to attempt the regulatory exam 6 mo prior to obtaining all proof of completion of tasks (signatures on log books, 70% of the total required tasks for each respective license), which mean, theoretically, you can write your exam 1y and 6mo into your apprenticeship, given that you have enough tasks signed off. (Check out Canadian Aviation Regulation Part V standard 566 subpart 03 article d ii: [https://tc.canada.ca/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/airworthiness-chapter-566-aircraft-maintenance-engineer-ame-licensing-training-canadian-aviation-regulations-cars#566\\_03](https://tc.canada.ca/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/airworthiness-chapter-566-aircraft-maintenance-engineer-ame-licensing-training-canadian-aviation-regulations-cars#566_03))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI provide this piece of information because I would like you to be informed about the ideal time you need to dedicate into this career to begin with. From my experience, to be able to have an opportunity to work in an environment that will offer you all the resources of passage to your license is scarce (eg. Air Canada), but if you are willing to learn and willing to do the above and beyond, there is a great chance you will like this profession as a career. You are welcome to contact me for and additional information.",

    "postText": "Good evening fellow heavy duty mechanics, CT mechanics, Trailer mechanics or whatever mechanic you identify as.\n\nIm currently working at very nice shop. I dont see myself leaving at all. Ill stay there for my entire career and hopefully retire as an instructor after my days of wrenching are over. Brand new machines, clean shop, good bunch of guys (apprentices and journeymen) im working with. Were a very niche shop, not too many companies out there are doing what we are doing. Anyhow im technically a manufacturer(Level 2 apprentice) heading to school at the end of Feb (Lvl.3) and trying to get level 4 done in Feb(2024) as im only allowed one level per year due to union rules. I want school done and out the way so i can get my hours and experience piled on. Getting your red seal is good, but it doesnt really mean anything lol. Im going to get it, but i want to keep learning and never stop. A good mechanic knows that theres always something new to learn. Im learning lots and its great!!! The only downside, is that I dont really have any experience in diagnosing problems whether it be (electrical, engine, hydraulic or whatever else there may be). My whole goal getting into this career was to in hopes one day, fully strip something down and put it back together just with all the knowledge that I\u2019ve gained. Now i know thats a far stretch but its a goal nonetheless. Ok enough rambling, i need some advice. Ideally, im saying ideally cuz this best case scenario. I would like to work at a shop on weekends that would give me that experience of ripping anything and everything apart. I want to know as much as i can and then some. Dozers, cranes, drill rigs, boats, planes, power plants. You name it im down. Greasy dirty, mucky gross or gravy jobs. GIVE ME THE WORK!!! Ideally this place would have no time limits. I like getting work done, effectively and efficiently(at my own pace) im still an apprentice. I dont need someone telling me to hurry up because i like getting work done right the first time, even if it takes me some time to get er done. I like the union im in the 115 so another union job would be at the top of my list. Gives me a sense of security, im not against private sector jobs, i just like having that security. I dont mess around, i like getting work done. Any suggestions on who which bigger companies i can reach out too? Im thinking of contacting Wajax and getting their opinion, heard they get lots of big jobs. Big jobs=more learning for me. Im great at networking and finding openings on my own. I just need a sense of direction thatll point me into the right area to look. All opinions are welcome, good and bad:) Also i wouldnt mind volunteering, gives me extra leeway for my free time.",

In the morning at Metrotown station that guy with fish eyes sitting in a walker holding a money 4 food sign occasionally smokes cigarettes and only has a dollar or 2 on a baseball cap that looks like it hasn't been washed since the current oldest student at bcit was born. Is he actually homeless or is he just your typical fraudster looking to mess with the emotions of emotionally drained students?",

The profs had hands-on experience, 92% of my class got hired in the field immediately, and it was quick and condensed, and school itself was lower priced than equivalent programs. \n\nOf course there's always a chance there are bad profs wherever you go, and the workload is heavy, but it does work. \n\nAnd it's in a gorgeous setting! The ocean and mountains aren't too far away :)",

They likely won't do anything, but may account for it in the work done when grading.\n\nTry to get them engaged some, talk with them about it, and then when they don't change at all, ignore them and do it all yourself, unfortunately. Hopefully you have a 1-2 other groupmates who aren't useless who can/will do work. Try to include in any group presentations who did what. It makes it glaringly obvious to everyone what's going on. Be polite about it though.\n\nIf you have people in your group who can/will do work, talk with them about it too, and see what you can do better/faster than them and visa-versa. Your goal is to reduce their workload by not being bothered doing stuff they find a pain, and visa-versa if you can. You do still need to cover what's in the course uh...late here....grading guide? In the end it's what the instructor mostly will look at. Your goal isn't to get back at the dead weight, it's to ensure you learn and pass.\n\nI only had to deal with one guy in my classes who did fuck all and nothing. Got grouped up with him for one class in the first term of my program, then did everything I could to avoid him in subsequent terms. He eventually dropped out. He had severe difficulty communicating in English. Partially what his problem was; it was impossible to coordinate anything with him even when you bent over backwards to do it as he found best(communicating in writing so he could run it through a translator later: realtime conversations were impossible). To this day I have no idea how he was accepted at BCIT. Or how he managed to pass a few classes. Maybe just lucky with working exclusively with people who spoke Mandarin. Or maybe rich family paying his way. Or both.",

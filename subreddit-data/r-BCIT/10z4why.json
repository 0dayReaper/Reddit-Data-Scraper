Once I got into my program, first week of class talking to some of the other guys and one of them mentioned he challenged the math requirement, and that the test was laughably easy(like just basic math questions, stuff anyone could figure out). \n\nNot sure if this is still a thing but look into it incase it is, I wasted an entire semester of time+money retaking a highschool math course at kwantlen, and i could have fulfilled the requirement in one test instead.",

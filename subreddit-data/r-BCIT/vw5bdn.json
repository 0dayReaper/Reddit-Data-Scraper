    "postText": "Anyone knows whats the difference between these 2 diplomas? It looks like Business Management has a separate mandatory application form as well asking for volunteer and work experience so I would imagine this would be the more competitive one to get into but in terms of credits, Business Operations Management has more credits (not sure if this matters).\n\nAny input is much appreciated.",

It is more people focused, like how to motivate employees.\n\nBusiness Operations Management is more geared towards the logistics of the organization such as procurement,  production, shipping/receiving, budgeting, etc. It is more process oriented. \n\nYou're more likely to find a job with the Operations option - just based on what I've seen.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm from Mumbai (India) looking to apply for the only course relevant for filmmaking. Have lots of questions so thought I could try finding my tribe here or seniors who could help with answers. \n\n1) How soon do seats fill up (applications start from Oct 3, 2022)? I am yet to take the pre-entry course. Photography (0060) can be done online so it seems more feasible since I'm not even in Canada but will the application window stay open that far?\n2) Ever presented a roadmap/5-year plan to your parents despite the fact that you know that success in this field is very unique and usually not according to plan? How did you convince your folks at home (I'm 26, if that information is relevant to help chart a  plan)\n3) Anybody who could reach assistant directing/producing on a film set or land a studio executive job? I've heard BCIT is more connected with broadcasting in Canada than Hollywood itself but are there any Hollywood working professionals who graduated from BCIT? \n4) How's it like graduating and working as an Indian applicant? \n\nMany more questions, these are just for starters. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Do the pre-entry course and apply asap. There's a good chance you'll be put on the waitlist and have to wait another year. I was put on the wait list and got in last minute since someone dropped out right before it started.\n\nI'm 18 years old, started the program when I was 17, in sept 2021. It was really easy for me as my parents know people in the industry, and I'm from here. I imagine it would be more difficult for you.\n\nThere are lots of people working in film, loads of successful people. I've heard of more in the local film industry in Vancouver, rather than in Hollywood. The instructors would know better than me about this.\n\nI just started my second year after freelancing over the summer. I had a very unpredictable schedule but had lots of work. There are plenty of jobs with normal hours too, or join the IATSE 891 or 669 locals after. I just think freelancing in live sports is more fun, and I don't need a stable income yet.\n\nIt takes a lot of volunteering and networking to make it in film or TV, but there is lots of work available.\n\nStudy and work hard in school. The instructors often refer grads to employers, and sometimes students.",

Very cautious thing you mentioned about them putting us on the waitlist.\n\nSo you mean we can become members of IATSE 891 or 669 while pursuing our course (before graduation)? Also, are you a local or an international student? Since I'll be an international student, work permit could be a condition before becoming a union member.",

However, you can also get started in a rental house, independent/non-union films, etc. getting membership in a film union during the course is practically impossible because this course takes up so much time. Union membership is a long term career goal, not something you can get right away. It takes 1-2 years for many people to become a member, but they can pick up freelance work on the way. There are also many other career options than film union. Just say yes to any job in the industry that you are available for at the start and then go from there.",

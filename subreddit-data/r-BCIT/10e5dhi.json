    "postText": "Hi Vancouverites! I am a UX design student who's currently creating a compass card app for a school project. My goal is to find the pain points and get some feedback from the compass card users. It is a quick survey which would only take about 2-3 minutes. If you have some spare time, I will very much appreciate it if you can fill out the survey below\n\n[https://forms.gle/uDmQowCojxsatNes6](https://forms.gle/uDmQowCojxsatNes6)\n\nThank you for your time!",

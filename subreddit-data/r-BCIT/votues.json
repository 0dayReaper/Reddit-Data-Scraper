    "postText": "Hi there, \n\nI got waitlisted by BCIT housing yesterday.\n\nI'm an international student starting OPMAN this fall. Can someone renting near BCIT please give a brief overview of the renting situation near BCIT? The cost, commute, and availability. Most importantly, how should I go about it given that I'll only be arriving in Vancouver close to the program start date (August end). Please offer your advice. \n\nAlso, is there any way to connect with potential flatmates?  \n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "Craigslist is probably your best bet. Housing is expensive right now and housing around BCIT, especially temporary student housing, is always more. Lots of rental scams going on right now because of the hot market, so be careful. You may be able to find some more info on the BCIT or Student Association website. \n\nBCIT does have dorms on campus. You may be able to get in there until you find something. \n\nGood luck.",

That would be really helpful for the community!",

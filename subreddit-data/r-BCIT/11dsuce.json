    "postText": "Hey there, I'm currently in Grade 11 and I want to get into BCIT for Mechatronics and Robotics. We are at the end of term two right now. The required courses to apply to their Mechatronics and Robotics Program are:  \nEnglish 12 (or First Peoples 12) minimum of 67%\n\nPre-Calc 12 min 73%\n\nand Physics 11 min 73%\n\nI'm taking English 12 and Pre-Calc 12 next year in my Grade 12 year but I'm taking Physics 11 right now. For term 1, I got 86% which I'm proud of but for my term 2 cumulative mark, I think I may be in the 70% range or even 60% range. I'm afraid right now because I understand all the concepts in physics so far like kinematics and dynamics. What are the chances that they accept me with my physics grade being just barely above 73%?\n\nDoes anyone have study tips and pieces of advice for me cause I get distracted a lot",

Specific courses have extra requirements and they are listed on the website with the program. My program didn't, so I breezed past admissions with my dogwood diploma. I'm in business.",

The failing rate after first year is like 50% so they tend to take as much as they can(ofc there is an intake limit due to lab equipments). Idk grade don\u2019t really matter, nobody care.",

The quality of intakes did not increase after it so i guess in a way is doesn\u2019t really matter, if you really want to get in then go for it i don\u2019t see why not. \nMy physics was 89%, math 11 was like 90% 12 was around 80ish, english was 76%. You wouldn\u2019t know if your intake pool have higher grade than you until you actually get in and see all of these people with a degree already. But the best way is to contact the office to get an actual opinion. Feels free to DM me if you want to ask more bout the program",

I don't think so. \n\nIf they really want CIT then that's fine. But if they choose CIT only because they are not confident with CST then that's another story. \n\nYou assumed without even asking why I asked the OP. And btw, the OP and I already talked just to let you know I didn't hound him about any programs.",

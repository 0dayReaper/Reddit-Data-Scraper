Don't know how many people do this, but I personally know someone who stacked up 20+ tickets before swapping his license plate. Maybe they're going to patrol more often or something but that was the case 1-2 years ago while I was at BCIT.",

The only time I heard someone get towed was because they parked in the staff parking. This is just my own experience though so it could be likely that someone has been towed for not paying tickets. Again, I'm not advocating not paying your parking fees, just stating some of the things some of my past classmates have experienced.",

Everyday, I rent a helicopter from Calgary to Vancouver, pick up my lambo, drop my gold fish off at a fish spa, get to BCIT for 730am pay for parking, leave at 9pm, grab my gold fish on the way to the airport and fly back, home and in bed by 245am all to do it again that same morning and 310am. Get a life dude.",

So if you are looking to gain some experience while enrolled, or even after graduating the program you can DM me at anytime for more info :)",

Lots of hands on learning after the first 2 courses and personally its very interesting to learn how broad the whole security systems environment is. I'm almost done with the program and i'll tell you to me this was the best learning experience i've ever had. \n\nAs much as i know from other students and what the instructors tell us, there's a lot of jobs out there in the security field and pretty much every company is looking for technicians. \n\nI'm taking the class with Jeff and if you want more detailed information, you can email him and he might be able to explain it really well for you. Go to the program's website and you'll find his contact information there. GOOD LUCK \ud83d\ude04",

Look under Faculty, Advisor's and Staff section.\nSST is located in SW3-1625/1635 at the Burnaby Campus.

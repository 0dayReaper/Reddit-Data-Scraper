    "postText": "I am starting the fire 1050 prerequisite course on september 12th. Its part time 2 days a week. I've tried looking for new student resources but I cant find anything. I went to the campus last week after work and it was a ghost town. I did manage to figure out parking and where my class will be, but I'm wondering if there's a parking app. Do I really just show up? Should I bring a notebook and pencil?",

As long as you know where your class is, yes just show up and bring a notebook and pencil.",

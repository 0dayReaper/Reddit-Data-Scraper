    "postText": "You're at the beginning of a rapid-paced, high-pressure, and ultimately worthwhile semester. I did a four year EE degree at BCIT and understand the pressures well. They are intense, but they are manageable. \n\nI wish you all the best of luck this semester and wish to offer some of my advice in dealing with the pending pressures and workload.. \n\n* Be mindful of how you use your time. Be diligent about completing work, but also make sure to take care of yourself. I can't prioritize your life, but you can. Take some time now to prioritize and plan good habits. Perhaps write them down to remind your future self. \n* Eat well and exercise. These good habits may lose priority as workloads overtake your existence. Try not to lose sight of the big picture and remember to take care of your physical health. I learned this the hard way. Both my general well being and my grades improved when I was mindful of my habits. \n* Don't lose your mind. The work is immersive and you will need to swim hard to keep ahead of the waves of workload and expectations. Try to have an outlet to take your mind away from the schooling daily, weekly, or whatever interval works for you. I have always had a bit of anxiety, but the depths of depression are complicated and I formed some antisocial habits while caught up in the work. This is easy to overcome once you recognize your habits. I suggest seeing a councilor (free service at the school) if things become overwhelming. Do this sooner than later. I discovered mindfulness meditation (care of Kurt the counselor) during my final year which helped immensely in keeping a clear mind and taking an edge off the stresses and presentation anxieties. \n* Use those cheesy study techniques. They work and save time! In particular, look up the pomodoro technique. If time permits (haha), check out the Learning How to Learn course by Dr. Barbara Oakley. It's free on Coursera.  Good study habits will open up more time for life in general so you can stay on top of your physical and mental health. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

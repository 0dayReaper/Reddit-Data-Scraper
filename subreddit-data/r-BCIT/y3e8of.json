Most of my classmates including myself got job offers before we graduated. \n\nIf English is not your first language then you may have a harder time with job interviews I believe all my cohorts eventually got a job related to their education. \n\nWhich diploma are you planing on taking?",

Do this well before you graduate because you won\u2019t have time during finals. Your education will open doors but you need to sell yourself which is a separate skill.",

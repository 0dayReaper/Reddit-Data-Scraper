    "postText": "I looked at the fees for a bachelor's in civil engineering for international students and one year here is apparently cheaper (C$20950) compared to a year at the University of New Brunswick ($22806) or Memorial University of Newfoundland (somewhere around C$23000 I kinda forgot), even though a lot of the websites about the cheapest universities in Canada mention the latter schools more. I also have not seen anyone cite BCIT as a relatively cheap school. Am I overlooking something in my calculations or are the costs actually true? Or maybe its quality makes up for its inexpensiveness (is it not that good of a school?)? Why is it inexpensive?",

They will be living pay check to pay check, living with roommates, and scrambling by during an emergency. Unless they have well off parents/partner to support them while they study. Going by the little info they provided and being an international student in the past, I should have gone to the east coast and moved to Vancouver after graduation for a higher paying job if avail",

It still looks like you start in the civil engineering technology program and have to go through competitive entry to get into 3rd year. So, if you want a guaranteed spot to study for an engineering degree, BCIT isn't the best option.",

You crew seems disbanded, you find yourself either working or with free time, and there isn't that sense of camaraderie like you used to have.\n\nWell I have good news for you. \n\nI am in the biomedical engineering program myself. And boy howdy free time is not something you will have anymore. But on the flip side you'll get close with your classmates really fast because it's necessary for survival.\n\nSo enjoy this time. Get to know yourself. Do some hobbiesl/ all the things that interests you. Because when the program starts you will be putting that all on pause.\n\nAlso familiarize yourself with circuit analysis. It will save you a lot of stress in the future.\n https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdnqjKaksr8qQ9w3XY5zFXQ2H-zXQFMlI\n\nThese videos are the only reason I passed first term. \n\nSorry I can't help you more with you current predicament, but I hope what I mentioned gives some solace.",

Identify the smart people (with easy to talk to personalities), and be in a group with them for every single project.  \n  \n&gt; And out of curiosity, where did you find your online gaming group?? That sounds fun :)  \n  \nLuck, no other way to put it. Became friends with a very nice person with a very similar personality, and she introduced me to her friends. Her friends also compliment my personality very well and vice versa so we all became very close.  \n  \n&gt; I\u2019m a bit older than you (turning 28)\n\nI wouldn't worry about it, BCIT's median age is somewhere around mid 20s. A lot of people are not fresh out of high school and you will be able to meet like minded people relatively easily.",

I am assuming your struggle has been recent and it hasn't been for too long. I predict you will find a lot of friends after starting school again. But given you're going to bio med, you'll most likely be trauma bonding as BCIT kicks every students ass. But of course you may or may not make life long friends there.\n\nMy point here is that, your friends from high school, whatever that is making you feel lonely. That feeling of abandonment that your friends are enjoying life and you are not there enjoying it with them. Try to forget that. That is not your life to live, you have to enjoy your own life. It is not about them. It is about you. You have to be the one in control of your happiness, not your friends.\n\nHow to enjoy life by yourself? Get excited about the things you are going to learn at school. Rewatch a tv series you thought you knew everything. Take this time to learn more about yourself. Alone time, is great time to listen to yourself.\n\nAt this stage in your life, it'll get better so don't worry. If in 10 years nothing has changed. Then worry. So far, it is temporary and you won't think about it until you realize this struggle was temporary and not the worse.",

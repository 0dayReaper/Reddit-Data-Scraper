    "postText": "hi! i'm a biology student at UBC that's (hopefully lol) going to graduate in the spring. i'm really interested in applying to a health science program at BCIT, but i've noticed that my biology 12 mark from high school has just hit five years old and that they prefer upgrading. thus far, i haven't taken the anatomy and physiology course equivalents at UBC, but i am a biology student so i've studied this material many, many times over. am i going to need to upgrade? or is having my high school credit just newly five years old and a biology degree enough to meet the requirement so i don't have to delay my application for a year? i'm feeling very distressed about my life lately and the thought of having to wait another year makes me really sad so i really only want to do it if i have no other choice. any thoughts are appreciated, thank u so much :)",

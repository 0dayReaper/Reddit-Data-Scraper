            "comment": "Here's some stuff I was told or *wish* I was told when I began the program.\n\n* Make sure you have a drawing tablet (don't bother with a screen just get a cheap one, believe me). Make sure you have an external hard drive or a usb with lots of space (256gb ideally). \n* Try to keep all your files organised, first semester has a lot of rendering so keeping your project folders structured will help. \n* Maya is a piece of shit and will crash at any moment for any reason, save often. You will lose hours and hours of work if you don't.\n* You're going to spend a lot of the next 18-months in a chair. Maintain good posture and walk around every now and then. Save yourself from the hunch-back.\n* Get plenty of sleep and don't regularly pull all-nighter's to get assignments in (ask for the odd extension if you need it).\n* Get to know your cohort well (start a discord or something), they will be your lifeline for the next 18 months.\n* Don't ever ever ever save anything to the C: drive, it will wipe on restart and every thursday night. The Z: drive is your personal network drive.\n* You'll probably know by the end of the first semester if this program is right or wrong for you. Do try not to fail anything, if you fail in first semester you cannot reattempt. If you fail in later semesters you will have to retake any failed units and you will desync with your cohort.\n* Make the most of your instructors, they're a wealth of knowledge and almost all still actively work in industry (Consider this program an 18 month job interview).\n* 65% is a pass, most instructors in 3DMAA are sympathetic and won't fail you on a technicality or anything, if you're struggling with a particular subject let them know so they can offer guidance. Other cohorts may even be able to answer questions or solve problems (they've probably been in the exact same position).\n* The scramble lab has about a dozen computers in it and it's specifically there for you to use for assignments, no classes in there. If your computer at home isn't powerful enough then make use of them. Try to keep renders going overnight in the other labs when classes end (People can and will cancel your render if they need to work on stuff and there's no free PCs).\n* Cafe Namu downstairs closes pretty early (2pm I think?) So don't count on it for late night food.\n* Maya will crash at any moment for any reason, save often. You will lose hours and hours of work if you don't. I'm writing this one again because it's the most important. Really really save often (There's an autosave feature but don't rely on it).\n\nThat's about all I can think of. Don't stress too much, you'll probably be fine. Bob Kreut is always available if you have issues or concerns.",

Is it better for me to get familiar with it first?\n\ndo we have any quizzes and tests or is it mainly consist of projects?\n\nAnd How many hours do you usually commit into each project? Was there one that was particularly challenging?",

If you have used Blender before it's a similar kind of program but much less user friendly. There is a student license if you want to get a head start.\n\nThey just changed around some of the subjects so your experience may differ slightly but in the first semester we also used Photoshop for digital painting, and Nuke for compositing. You will be using Adobe Substance Painter for making textures for models too. Also Zbrush for digital sculpting in semester 2 (the UI is awful but you get used to it)\n\nIt varies by subject but we only had one exam and it was the final for Compositing in semester 1. Comp isn't part of the course anymore so you might have a test for the subject that replaced it. It is virtually all project based. Game Design Pipeline 1 (semester 3) had weekly quizzed but they were really just to make sure you were paying attention.\n\nThe hardest semester is 4, the workload is insane but you will come out all the better for it. The semester 2 body sculpt and vehicle model we're big difficulty spikes but if you learn good topology in semester one you'll be fine. As always if you ask for advice and support from instructors you'll get plenty.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask! Good luck in January!",

    "postText": "Hey guys, in bit of a pickle here.\n\nI've been taking CIT, and now I want to transfer out to focus/specialize on web dev. Long story short, either I take the Full Stack Diploma  OR just go finish my Design degree + do the Front End Developer certificate.\n\nThe full stack will take another 1.5 year, or I can go for the front end certificate, which will be 7 months long but likely to get me a job early. The design degree is graphic comms at another school and I only need to finish few more courses.\n\nI'm really not sure how to weigh this one out because what is better? Full stack education vs. design degree+frontend+job hunt earlier? Please, would very appreciate advice and help, I am still an amateur in this field. Thank you",

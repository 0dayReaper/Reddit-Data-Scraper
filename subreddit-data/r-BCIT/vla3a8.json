I have a little business selling apps, but I was thinking about trying to get a normal programming job working for someone else. Being self-employed is very stressful. I was curious if any current CS students have older people in their classes? Thanks :-)",

            "comment": "Hey there! Recent BCIT Alumni here, there are definitely people that are 35+ in these programs. From my experience it usually goes 2 ways. I\u2019ve seen older people kind of isolate themselves in a sense from their classmates..maybe bc they feel uncomfortable because of the age gap between peers. However I\u2019ve also seen the other side where someone abit older feels comfortable and connects with peers more in a sense like \u201cdamn you yougins are in a good spot!, let\u2019s work together and succeed together\u201d  type thing. My advice. On the first day just be genuine. Everyone is a little nervous and eager to make friends. You definitely want to make friends on the first day of classes. I think I would rather be person number 2 in this situation. BCIT is tough to get through by yourself. However, if you do have 4 years of coding experience, you might just feel more comfortable ripping through it on your own! And that\u2019s totally fine dude!.. I would encourage you to make friends and connect. Because if you really do have 4 solid years of coding experience, you probably Don\u2019t need to go to Bcit and spend all that money. Your probs ready to work right now dude. You have 2+ years on everyone in your classes\u2026most likely. Depends what your trying to get out of it. Honesty, I learned so much from my Bcit experience that I wouldn\u2019t have changed it for the world. Keep in mind, I also had basically 0 experience when I started. Cheers and goodluck!\n\n..not sorry at all for the long post. Im providing value so if you read it, your in a good spot.",

I am just wondering has anyone here applied for mechanical engineering program with a trade degree? \n\nI have my automotive service technician  diploma and want to go back to school. However, I don\u2019t know  whether would I be able to use it as a stepping stone to ME.",

I don't know if it costs money, but I know in high school, a long time ago, I was able to take online courses on my own. \n\nIf BCIT admits you because of your background without taking additional coursework, I'd recommend spending some time on Khan academy reviewing the math, physics, and English curriculum. Math and physics are critical to understanding nearly every course in the program.",

I have a red seal in Automotive Service, but because I did not do my schooling at BCIT I did not get a boost to my GPA. They did, however, give me an unconditional entry despite not quite having the prerequisites complete at the time of my application. It is not likely that the service technician diploma will translate to much more than hands-on experience.",

    "postText": "I'm a manager [28f] at an engineering firm and regularly interview recent BCIT grads for various positions at our company. I've interviewed several lovely people lately and wanted to pass on some interviewing tips in particular for new grads. Hope the info below helps.\n\n1. If you got an interview, it was likely because of something cool or interesting about your resume - not your experience. Use this to your advantage. \n\nI see a lot of new grads come through our office who are desperately trying to make it seem like they have experience in our specific field, when we already know that you don't. Instead of trying to convince us you have experience, ask us what in particular we liked about your resume and hone in on that. I've often selected candidates because it seemed like they took on unique projects, were heavily involved in extracurricular work or because the layout of their resume was different. The worst mistake new (inexperienced) grads make is trying to convince me that their 4-month co-op in a completely unrelated discipline will \"make me an asset to your organization.\" \n\n2. Since you may not have tons of experience to talk about, please prepare some interesting questions for us! \n\nI cut an interview short simply because the candidate ran out of things to talk about and had no questions for me. If they had however asked anything remotely related to our field, I would have continued the interview and probably been delighted to yammer on about all the things I'm passionate about. Don't be afraid to ask strange/random/fun/interesting or silly questions! We are people too and most engineering companies are not overly formal. Judge your audience of course, but keep in mind you may run out of stuff to talk about since school and a few co-ops doesn't really give you tons. \n\n3. When you do talk about your experience, try to make it very clear that you have transferable skills. \n\nIt will likely be that you have technical experience in an unrelated discipline, so do the work for the interviewer and tell them (me) how what you learned in this other industry might relate to the things needed in my industry. For example, if you have co-op or class experience coding in Python, but are interviewing for a job where that's not needed, be sure to say something like \"even though I've only learned Python, I learned how to understand algorithms and really honed in on my attention to detail skills that it sounds like this job might require.\" [PS - I am not a programmer so if this is a dumb example forgive me...] \n\n4. Be prepared that you are completely unqualified for the job you are applying for, and that's totally A-okay. \n\nAgain, when I interview a new grad I do not expect them to have experience or even be qualified for the job. I'm looking for someone who I can train, who will contribute to the team and who will go the extra mile to get the necessary skills. If I bring up your inexperience, take this as an opening to tell me how hard you'll work to get up to speed or how you will study after work hours to gain technical skills if that's required. \n\nAnyways, hope that helps. Feel free to ask me questions. ",

They then really impressed me by asking questions specifically about the project, like \"how did you guys solve problem XYZ that you mentioned.\" \n\nThe questions impressed me more than their answers to my interview questions because it showed me, a) they were actually interested in our applications and technology and b) their thought process. \n\nA good kooky/different one was when my co-worker and I were doing a joint interview, they asked me who was more likely to prank the other one -- which was fabulous because my colleague is a huge prankster and then got to detail all the glorious pranks he has played on us...

It\u2019s kinda difficult when you know any 10 of your candidates can do the job and are a right fit... so basically your job is to find reasons not to hire someone and then choose whoever is left - awesome! \n\nIt\u2019s a dog eats dog world outside of BCIT - good luck!",

We already know why not to hire them \\-\\- inexperience, but the purpose of my post was to say that they likely have many reasons why we should hire them, they just need to be showcased. New grads or inexperienced workers are in a unique situation in that their background can't speak for them like someone with years of experience. ",

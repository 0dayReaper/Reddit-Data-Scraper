I'm pretty sure I'm not eligible for EI if I'm not gonna be looking for work while attending school full time business hours. \n\nI'm just really confused on what my next next step should be.",

I'm no expert or anything, but I was disappointed by the amount too.  I needed to borrow money from my parents to pay for the classes because the loan wasn't nearly enough.  I don't live with them, but they're doing me a favour.  I was assessed me as needing a lot more than $9600 for my classes &amp; living expenses (the amount for the program itself is $7000+), but that was the maximum loan amount for that length of time, and the assessment said I had to find the rest of the money elsewhere.   \n\n\nI took an LOA from my job so that I could give school my full attention, so I'm not currently working.  I was fortunate to have my parents help me out... As someone who struggles quite a lot with attention issues in school, I probably take more time on assignments and projects than the average person, so I couldn't see myself balancing a part-time job with full-time school.  I think a lot of people could probably manage it, though.  I'm sure it depends on the program. The one I'm in doesn't overload us with too much work, at least not so far.  Hopefully you can make it work.  (Sorry I kinda rambled a bit!)  :)",

That\u2019s a good thing. So don\u2019t be afraid to use those savings. That\u2019s what they\u2019re there for. \n\nBut as for money, you can try driving for Uber or Skip or somewhere, if they need drivers. That\u2019s fairly flexible and should work around a busy BCIT sked \n\nTalk to BCIT student services and ask about applying for any possible grants, credits, etc. May not be much, but there may also be a lot. You won\u2019t know unless you ask and apply \n\nYou can also look into lines of credit with the bank. Not ideal, but something that can at least give you some comfort in knowing you have that available. It\u2019s a last-resort, after student loans and whatever savings you\u2019re willing to use \n\nGood luck!",

It's been painful, but I trust that it's going to work out. One of the nice things about government student loans right now is that a portion is a grant (around 25%) that I won't have to pay back.",

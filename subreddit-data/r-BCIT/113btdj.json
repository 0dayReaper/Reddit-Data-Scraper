Does anyone know how much BCIT cares how you did on the Casper? \n\nDo you think that BCIT would accept someone In the 3rd quartile?",

On the other hand, I\u2019ve heard nursing is more selective about Casper scores, but I didn\u2019t hear that from someone who\u2019s actually in BCIT nursing so maybe take it with a grain of salt.",

    "postText": "Hello friends,\n\nI'm an international student studying my first course (Predictive Analytics in Conestoga college) in Canada, its 1 Year Grad Certificate course. Now i wanna do 1 more course related to Data analytics, i found BCIT is offering a similar course -  [Business Analytics, Graduate Certificate, Full-time \u2013 BCIT](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/business-analytics-graduate-certificate-full-time-a600grcert/#courses) , but this program shows only 6 courses across 2 semesters and they look to focus more on theory instead of practical's (i prefer more hands on experience on tools). Is there anyone doing this course, can you please share your thoughts ? \n\nI found another similar course in BCIT -  [Applied Data Analytics, Certificate, Part-time \u2013 BCIT](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/applied-data-analytics-certificate-part-time-5512cert/)  \\- this is more focus on tools but it is Part Time. If i take this course am i eligble to get Open work permit for 3 years or not ?",

            "comment": "Most likely not because I don't even think this program (ADAC) is eligible for a government student loan. So most likely not. I'd get in touch with a program advisor.\n\nI would also prefer to ADAC over the Business program as it'll prepare better for a job. I'd only recommend the first program you listed, if you're a director and need to understand data analytics on a high level.",

            "comment": "The difference between the two programs is that ADAC focuses on who/what/where/how of data collection and the BAGC focuses on how to work with the data to make business decisions. The BAGC is hands-on and practical (BCIT only does small amounts of theory work and focuses more on applied course work to make you hireable) and 97% of grads get training related jobs within 6 months.",

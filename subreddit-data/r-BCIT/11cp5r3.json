            "comment": "I do it and enjoy it. I\u2019ve been taking it almost daily for two years and I\u2019ve never been late to class because of the WCE. The only delays I\u2019ve ever experienced have been exclusively on the evening train going back home and they have almost all been caused by CP trains being slow or behind schedule with only 1 occasion being due to a switching issue.\n\nPros: much quieter, more comfortable, and faster than bussing and sky train. \nAbout equal speed or faster than driving depending on where you\u2019re coming from and how much traffic is on the road. \nTables that you can work on with outlets for charging your phone or laptop. \nI\u2019ve never used it there is also a Cafe car where you can get coffee and I think snacks from as well. \nAs a BCIT student you can get a massive discount on upgrading your Upass to allow the WCE. A return ticket from my local station is ~$18 or I can pay about $100 and have infinite rides for the whole month. That saves like $300 \n\nCons: getting to the nearest station could be a hassle depending on how close you live to it and what modes or transport you could use to get there (bike, walk, drive).\nWhile generally not too crowded at certain times of day in certain cars you might have someone sitting beside and across from you. This doesn\u2019t bother everyone of course but it may bother you idk. Though the people on the WCE keep to themselves much more than on the Skytrain. (I\u2019ve never heard anyone playing music out loud on WCE).\nDepending on how early you arrive to your station you could be exposed to some not great weather since most stations don\u2019t offer much to mitigate it. Dress appropriately.\nThe biggest con for me is just the evening schedule. The first eastbound train leaves at 3:50 PM so if you went down for two morning classes your stuck there unless you take the sky train and bus back. Additionally the easiest train to take back is the 5:30 PM train which leaves only 10 minutes after the last class on most day. You can walk to the station in those 10 minutes but I don\u2019t like to leave it that close just in case I get unlucky with light timings and then realize I forgot to renew my Upass for example. To remedy this I just ask any instructors who have classes that end at 5:20 if I can leave like 2 minutes early and they\u2019ve all said yes so far.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend at least trying it out for a month to see how you like it. Sorry for rambling",

Go for it - way better to nap and end up at your destination than to have to focus on driving in rush hour traffic",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI've recently accepted an offer for CST this coming January, but I am also waiting on hearing back from SFU's second degree CS program. The shorter length and practical mindset of CST really appeal to me, but what worries me is the limited co-op availability, especially in this tough recession and job market, compared to SFU CS, where co-op is basically open to all students. I would put my full efforts into getting into co-op at BCIT, but who knows what will happen given the high competitiveness.\n\nI was just wondering if anybody who had completed CST without getting into co-op had any success stories or anecdotes to share? I'd love to hear your thoughts/feedback, thanks!!",

For example, there will be many hands-on projects, assignments, and relevant technologies that you can put on your resume.\n\nI know friends who did not do co-op, but they put effort in learning and applying to jobs, which helped them get a job after grad. I think even in this recession, if you persevere, you will be able to get a job after grad.",

Just make sure you have some projects you can talk about, make a linkedin, and go to some job fairs. Anything to increase your chances at getting some interviews. \n\nEven without a co-op, you can take steps to make yourself stand out compared to those who did get into co-op. Also, there's nothing stopping you from applying to summer internships.",

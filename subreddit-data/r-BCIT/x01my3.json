            "comment": "I went into it with no programming experience, because I was working overtime in order to afford the tuition.\n\nThe reputation of the program is true. You'll spend half your day in classes, and a good % of the other half doing homework and assignments.\n\nMy grades were okay, but sometimes I felt like I was too busy to actually learn, you know? Like I was trying to strategize and complete the assignments as efficiently as possible.\n\nThat being said, my advice would be to stay on top of your work. If you get even a week behind then it's hard to catch up. If you do things as soon as they're assigned, you'll probably have free time for hanging out with friends/family and just generally taking care of your physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nTry and look up the course outlines on BCIT's site and learn a bit about the topics that will be covered in the first week. Don't go hardcore, because CST is a marathon and not a sprint so it's important you come into day 1 feeling fresh and optimistic.\n\nTry and do errands before the term starts. Your time will become precious very quickly so it can help to clear smaller tasks like getting your haircut, buying groceries, taking your car to the mechanic, buying school supplies etc.\n\nIf all of this sounds intimidating, then don't stress yourself out. I broke half of my own advice and I did okay. But CST is a demanding program so I'm just talking about optimization.\n\nIf I could pick 1 thing to be serious about - then definitely start the term NOT procrastinating. Your first week or 2 might be light and lull you into a sense of false security.\n\nIt's common for a class to release an assignment and give you 2 weeks to do it. In isolation that's a lot of time. But then the next week you get 2 more assignments from 2 different classes. And then if you've procrastinated then you have 3 assignments due in 8 days (in addition to classes) and you're in a world of stress. \n\nThat's why it's important to start things as soon as you get them.\n\nI wrote a lot, so any other questions then just ask",

If at dtc, i'd imagine it'd be the same thing but in python. If you already know these things, you'll be in good shape and you'll have a way better chance of getting into co-op if that's your goal. So many people in cst like to fake that they are completely new to coding but they finish the java assignments in a couple of hours so don't be fooled.",

            "comment": "I graduated almost 10 years ago, so my advice may be out of date, but I'll do my best. In no particular order:\n\n\\- Try to become your set rep. This will give you easier access to teachers, and give you a reason to interact with everyone in your set. It's easier to network when you're a center of contact.\n\n\\- At the start of the semester, each class hands you a syllabus. Compile them into one master spreadsheet. This way you can see where the pain points will be, months in advance. Like maybe you have a presentation on the same day in three classes. Instead of trying to write all three the night before, you know to space things out.\n\n\\- Don't buy your books in advance. A lot of times the teachers will tell you they're not necessary.\n\n\\- Sit in the front three rows. Many studies show students up front get higher marks.\n\n\\- If there is anything you don't understand in class, raise your hand and ask for clarification. That's literally what the teacher is there for. To help you understand. 99% of the time if you don't understand something, a bunch of other people in the class don't understand, and are too scared to ask.\n\n\\- USE TEACHER OFFICE HOURS. They're honest to god sitting in their offices hoping someone shows up to ask questions. Keith used to have tea and cookies waiting and was sad nobody showed up. They'll straight up walk you through assignments if you just show up to ask.\n\n\\- Cancel every subscription you have to any video games. You do not have time to game. At all. Ever.\n\n\\- Never skip a class. You paid for that seat, show up and sit in it.\n\n\\- Try to find out who the smart people in your set are and be near them at all times. BCIT is VERY heavy on group work, and you never want to end up in the leftovers group. You want to just look around at the three or four people around you, the smart people, and work with them.\n\n\\- Youtube is one of your best friends. Sometimes hearing the exact same lesson said with different words can really really help.\n\n\\- You want to get into coop, 100%. How do you do that? Your first semester is the most important semester. They line up all the marks for all the students and take the top 30. Be in that top 30.\n\n\\- How do you keep your marks high? Pay the fuck attention. Almost every assignment you get from a teacher will tell you exactly what you have to do to get full marks. Literally exactly. If it says they want 5 paragraphs, write 5 paragraphs. If they say two pages, give them two pages. Just do what you're told.\n\n\\- Sign up for summer semester classes. Third semester is brutal, but I took two classes (while doing my coop) so it was way easier. Highly recommend.\n\n\\- Do not use websites that answer coding questions to get answers to your assignments. You might pass the assignment, but you'll fail the midterms. SO MANY people failed midterms because they were doing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I can try to help.",

Best stduents in my term including me developed the habbit to finish homework the day it was assigned - if possible - by staying on campus. then we would just head home and relax. doing this, personally for me, did not seem like alot. I finished the term with very high grades.\n\nThat being said...\n\nform a good study group, that's gonna be ur source of info and motivation. do not be that one student who singles themselves out, you will not do well. It's how the tech industry works rn anyways, they need to know you're capable of doing work in a teamwork environment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif u have any other specific questions about grades or anything just dm me",

If I were you, I'd wait until you get into term 3 before considering buying a new laptop. The student attrition rate for CST is pretty high, and nobody wants to be like my one setmate who spent $1800 on a new school laptop in term 2 just to fail out that semester \ud83d\ude05    \n\nIn term 3, you'll likely be doing Android Studio (which notoriously runs very poorly even on high-end PCs) and your option classes, which might influence what you want buy. For example, if you get into Web and Mobile, you might consider getting a Mac for iOS dev (though they do have some Mac minis students can borrow), or if you get into AI/Predictive Analytics, you'll likely need something more powerful unless you wanna take 2 weeks to train a simple model lol. That being said, most of the Burnaby options have their own room/computer lab that you get 24hr access to, so you might not even need to upgrade.    \n\nBCIT also offers [bursaries](https://www.bcit.ca/financial-aid/awards-scholarships-bursaries/bursaries/) for term 2 and 4 CST students, which could help fund a new laptop for you next year. I applied during term 2 and 4 and ended up getting the max of $2300 each time",

So for each 150 student intake, about 135 students make it to term 2, 122 make it to term 3, 110 make it term 4, and about 100 graduate. Ask most CST grads and they'd say the number is higher, especially in the first 2 terms lol. Keep in mind student attrition isn't just failing, it's also dropping out/not continuing for any reason. One my setmates didn't come back for term 3 because they got offered a full-time position from their co-op placement",

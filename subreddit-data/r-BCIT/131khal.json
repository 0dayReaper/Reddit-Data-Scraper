I already have around 105 credits, about 25 transferred. Is it hard to increase GPA by 6%? If anyone has insight on program admission, raising GPA I\u2019d be thankful.",

I noticed the grade they used for one of the 5 required courses (which I failed and retook), was not a weighted average (61.5%) but actually the higher score (76%). Not sure if this was intentional or a mistake, however if I think about it. I don't think I would've been able to get into the BBA.\n\nI graduated from the part-time program, so idk if that makes a difference. At the time, they also said they'd take a weighted average. DM me if you want more details.\n\nUPDATE: Actually I just remembered they use the weighted average of the 5 required courses which need to be an average GPA of 70%... it's possible I met this requirement... \ud83e\udd14 but remember calculating it and noticing they didn't use the weighted average of the class I failed. For other classes not part of the 5, they definitely didn't use the average of the GPA's for that class (for ones I took twice)...",

From what I recall you need both the 70% average across the core courses as well as 70% average across the entire diploma. \n\nI had a few friends that were under the 70% mark for their overall grade in their diploma program who weren\u2019t accepted into the BBA. Due to it being competitive to get in to, I would recommend retaking a few easier classes to bump up that gpa to at least a 70%.\n\nIt could be different now as I go into the BBA 3 years ago, but I kind of doubt it tbh.\n\n* Keep in mind the BBA is quite difficult lol. Managerial Economics WILL kill you, its a mix of micro econ and calculus.\n\n* You have to take calculus in the BBA as well but that is NOTHING compared to Managerial Econ*\n\nShoot me a DM if you want to know more about the classes!",

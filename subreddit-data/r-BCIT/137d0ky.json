These are the people that you will interact with for your entire time there (going to class, studying, doing projects, etc.), so it'll be relatively easy to make friends in this set.  Just make sure you put in the effort to get close with them in the first week.  As for making friends outside of the set, it'll really depend on how hard the IT program is and how much free time you will have outside of it.  As I haven't taken it I can't give you an accurate answer on that, but there are always clubs that you can join to meet new people.",

            "comment": "Depends. Met good friends from my set. Since you will be with the same set minus people who fail/drop out, you can make good friends you can study with until 2 am in the library. We used to go to the bar and have some shots sometimes. No partying as no one has time or money to. Definitely partied at friends place a couple times eapecially during breaks. I was in business, so I might be different from IT. Also you can join clubs which will help make friends and network for the job you want. Highly recommend joining at least one club that's related to your program. Also, sometimes there are events that the school plans so students can mingle. If you put in the effort to make friends, it's not hard. The hard part is finding the energy to make friends after studying ur ass off.\n\nPeople who says theres no social life either prob too burned out to make friends or they didnt have social life before school to begin with. Yes, compared to UBC or SFU we dont have much social life",

We go out to lunch together daily, we have a group chat, we plan gym days and study together. It's not hard to make friends if you are actively trying. There's definitely no parties... lol",

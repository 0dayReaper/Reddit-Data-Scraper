To be safe, since it\u2019s hard to gauge when all the seats will be filled, apply with your mid-term exam, or a letter from your instructor saying you meet the 67% requirement. You'll be given a provisional seat and a deadline to submit your final grade. That way, you don\u2019t have to wait until you finish COMM.",

If so, would you be able to share with me your planned schedule? \n\nThat will help me a lot in organizing and studying. \n\nI would really appreciate any info!",

Not commuting gave me back 2-2.5 hrs/day (home \u2192 work \u2192 school \u2192 home) so I donated it all to school. Combine that with entertainment being closed and I had a lot of time to throw at it...\n\nMy suggestion would be 2-3 courses/semester. All told you're going to do something like 40 courses, so if you can hit 9/year then four years or so.\n\nException for things like being already good at the content being taught. I taught myself .Net years ago, so the .Net class was a waste of time and I could therefore take more concurrently.",

I went to the Computing part-time info session, and the person conducting the session said most courses require 10 to 15 hours of work outside of class? Did you find this to be the case? How were the instructors for the part-time classes?",

    "postText": "I really would like to apply for an engineering degree through BCIT, but there is a catch\n\nI have just graduated high school and currently, I'm in the process of retaking PreCalc 12 as I have not met the requirement for the prereq in that course but met everything else. I will be finishing it before October 1st, which is when applications open up.\n\nHowever, I am not the most brilliant in the math department and I am not sure if this program is right for me. I believe I acquire many technical skills and I am able to piece information quickly, but not regarding math. I also do not spend much time studying when I need to and I am not sure if I will be able to survive the workload, especially since I would like to be accepted in the Beng program, which many try for and only a few are accepted every year according to their GPA\n\nCan I get some insight on this from any engineering students at BCIT? Thanks!",

The concepts in the first semester start off easy, but since it\u2019s electrical engineering we end up doing a lot of trigonometry and complex math. Ending the semester doing trigonometry with complex numbers. The final will be a doozie but just give your life to academia for a few months and you might survive the first bloodbath. Circuit ANALysis will be painful if you don\u2019t prepare. Sure it\u2019s a hard program but the kids that stay focused and work hard do well. The professors don\u2019t want you to fail and you get rewarded for showing up to class and doing your homework by seeing similar questions discussed in class on big assessments. Also failing a single test or a quiz isn\u2019t the end of the world so don\u2019t give up. Some kids here seemed to be doing better than me at the start of first semester but I caught up and surpassed them which you can do too. Stay focused and you\u2019ll be fine.",

I'm in my second semester of first year and we've already lost over 20 students since the year began. That's 30% of our class. It's super rewarding if you can handle it but just beware.",

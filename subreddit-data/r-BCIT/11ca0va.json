    "postText": "As the title says. My laptop sh*t the bed and I have a course starting in 2 weeks. Is a Chromebook powerful enough to withstand a full 8 hours of video or would it most likely lag out and drop me constantly? Just need to know so I can start seeing if I can steal a family member's laptop or sit at their house during the day.",

If it's an 'async' course then it's functionally equivalent to watching YouTube videos.\n\nIf it's synchronous, the BCIT platform is called Bongo and it's browser based with very few features. A few profs have used different platforms (Cisco WebX / Zoom / Discord) but they are the minority. You can also run such things off your phone.",

It's what I've done in the past so I can be on the couch, have my books open and be comfortable. I just need to find out if a Chromebook would be able to withstand the needed performance to successfully be on Bongo and be in that setting for a full day.",

    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nDoes someone have experience with Ashok Pamu? I'm considering taking Relational Database Design and SQL (COMP1630), and the instructor is Ashok Pamu. I've looked for the rate of him, but nothing was found. I think I can have other options that is Alexander Volkov who has great reviews or Maryam Khezrzadeh. I have only basic knowledge of SQL and really want the best instructor. Can someone give me advice?",

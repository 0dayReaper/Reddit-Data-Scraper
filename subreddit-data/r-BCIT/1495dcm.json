    "postText": "So basically, im a BCIT CST graduate that recently just landed a full stack dev job. I still want to focus on education since i went immediately into CST from highschool. So, in the fall i decided i want to persue something with design/animation/game dev since ive always had a passion and hobby with self projects. I also have the technical side of software and coding but dont want to lean too much into theoretical/mathematical. I've narrowed down to something like a technical artist/generalist where i could have a balance of both technical and creative as a career (which is something similar ive done at my previous internship at a VFX company). Would continuing the bachelor of applied compsci game dev option from CST be more suitable or would getting another diploma in the technical arts be too unrelated? How do the two programs compare? Also i accepted and planned on getting a UBC bachelors of compsci but i have to start at square 0 and have too many math/unrelated req courses.",

If you're beyond hope, the people next to you on the treadmill at the gym, point at the screen playing local news and say \"can you believe this?\".",

I extend friendly small talks with the convenience store lady to an unfriendly length, I can feel the line behind me slowly growing longer as the angry stares of the people behind me stab into my back. I love it. Sitting by myself on the bus home, I pat the empty seat next to me, inviting strangers to sit next to me. When someone walks towards me from the end of a long hallway, I maintain AGGRESSIVE EYE CONTACT all the way, cos looking away shows weakness.\n\nI am a menace to society.",

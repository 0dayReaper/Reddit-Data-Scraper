    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am planning to apply for the OPMAN or Business Management program next year in September 2021. \n\nBackstory: I spent my early to mid twenties working as a health administrator in various health organizations within the lower mainland. With my family mainly having a background in hospital jobs, (nursing, techs, pharmacists) I thought I would the same and get my foot in the door in a hospital while I save up money for a psych nurse program.\n\nThis strat worked well but I wasn't interested pursuing a RPN degree anymore after a couple years of working in a hospital.\n\nEarlier this year, I started my own online business and it produced very humble successes. This venture really motivated me to learn the ins and outs of business. Hopefully, with the knowledge from BCIT, I will be able to grow business and maybe even do it full time some day.\n\nPost grad, I would love to work in supply chain and work my up to operations manager or work as a operations worker for the city.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nHow does one manage the heavy course load in OPMAN?\n\nWhat is the difference between OPMAN, Business management, International business management, \"    \" - global supply chain?\n\nThank you for all of your answers and time!\n\nWhat are the job prospects? Hourly and salary wage? (If you dont mind disclosing, range is ok too)\n\nWhat is the most challenging aspects of the programs?\n\nTl;dr\n27 yr old hosp admin/ ecommerce business owner planning to go back for business school in BCIT",

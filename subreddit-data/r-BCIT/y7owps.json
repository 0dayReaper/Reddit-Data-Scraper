Does anyone know anything like the average grades of people that got in, acceptance rate, etc? Oh also are you supposed to apply now or after February if you are taking one of the entrance requirement courses next semester? (currently in grade 12 right now btw)",

Or you can say youd expect to get it at a certain time, but I'll leave that to your discretion.\n\nIf you want, you can always clarify with the program coordinator for your program or a program advisor (full time/part time). You can also ask any specific questions, like the rate of acceptance to your program, your likelihood of getting accepted based on your current and expected grades, and when or how to apply for the term you want. \n\nSpeaking from experience, i'd recommend meeting with a program advisor first, as they can help you look at the programs youre interested in and give you more information, so you can plan ahead for your application to the school. So for instance if you dont get in your first choice program, what is your second choice of program, when do they start accepting and closing applications, seat availability, and what you need to prepare. \n\nGood luck!",

But when youre  offered acceptance, it will be *conditional* acceptance under the condition that you achieve the required grade for chemistry after completion. \n\nThere are usually deadlines for the conditions you have yet to meet (like submitting your final chem grade), so you can speak to the coordinator/advisor (whoever is in charge) to postpone the deadlines if necessary.\n\nBut id recommend speaking to a program coordinator/advisor still just to make sure.",

Also, take it from a civil grad myself, the transportation engineering aspect of the civil program is almost non-existent.",

BCIT civil grads enter a range of disciplines within civil, but just so you know, the \"transportation\" aspect of the program is a joke and is in it's infancy still. Second year, we have a civil3d-based road design course which covers some road geometrics and a bit of TAC, and it glosses over some civil3d (it's autocad but specialized for road design). In fourth year, we have a joke of a course called CIVIL 7050 which is far less technical and far less rigorous than this \"second year course\" and only glosses over some of the concepts of transportation, much like writing the front headlines of a city of burnaby transportation initiative. It has no math in it, no probabilistic modelling of transportation, and the title of the course \"transportation engineering\" is extremely misleading",

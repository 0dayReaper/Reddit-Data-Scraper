If so , what was the program like, how was finding a job, and what was your starting salary and what is it now? Also, is there room to grow and advance in this career field?\nI already have a degree and just recently learned about this field and am interested.\n\nThank you!",

He said it's the most low key undercover awesome job outcome program at BCIT. He got into the program after doing student for a day and last time I spoke is loving the career flexibility and salary. He also had a Bachelors in Kin. Think he said many students have a a degree.",

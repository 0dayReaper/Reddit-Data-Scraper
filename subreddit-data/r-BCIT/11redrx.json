Unless you're under 30 years old it would seem ancient. \n\nI find it amusing that kids can figure out mobile apps but give them a DOS prompt and they'll be totally clueless.\n\nGrowing up with older tech and no existence of any internet gave people a reason to figure out how software and hardware worked, like configuring hardware with jumper pins, and actually reading an instruction manual to install something, yet alone understand the technical requirements.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm on the waitlist for the mechanical engineering program this Fall. They told me I was in the top 20 a few months ago, don't know where I'm at now. Does anyone know the start date for the fall term yet? I know pay cutoff is 60 days prior, so that's when the waitlist will be sorted out I guess. \n\nI have over 90% in all the prereqs if that makes a difference.",

This wasn't the case when I was in it. \n\nIt was a good program. There was a lot of work. I think there have been a few questions on this subreddit that may be more relevant. \n\nThe advice I would give falls into three categories. 1. Plan, prioritize, and triage. 2. Preparation. 3. Work at your pace.\n\n1. Plan - note down all of the assignments, midterms, projects and other due dates in a calendar. I would use a physical planner to record my progress towards assignments and what I achieved / was working on each day. I would use the calendar on my computer &amp; phone to record due dates and set reminders. \n\nPrioritize - your GPA is based on weighted averages determined by the credits in each course. In first term, your engineering graphics course is worth the most credits, so it will have the largest impact on your grade. The math, statics / dynamics, strength of materials, fluid mechanics, and thermodynamics are the core of the program and build on each other, so you need to make sure you learn those well.\n\nTriage - exams are more important than homework assignments and you'll need to prioritize studying for exams while balancing homework assignments. \n\nFor exams, we used to get most of the credit for the work and not the final answer. I would go through my exams and solve the problems with the most credit first, but I would leave the final answer to the end of the exams. I would set up the problem, identify the formula, perform the manipulations, enter numbers and wait until the last few minutes to plug the numbers into the calculator and get a numerical answer. \n\n 2. Preparation - within a course, the material builds on what you've previously learned. Between courses, they build on top of each other. Even if there is no homework or anything else assigned during the first week, it's good to review previous material. It's good to periodically review material from earlier in the term too. \n\nYou should be very comfortable with calculations and the math used in the program. It should be a lot of algebra for the first two years, then you'll need to be comfortable with calculus (I didn't finish the engineering degree, but this is what I had heard). \n\n3. BCIT has a diverse set of students. We had a student with a physics degree in my year, for example. There are students who have taken a lot of math or are really strong writers or who had a lot of CAD and other computer experience. If other students say it's a quick assignment or material didn't take long to learn, don't let that get you down if it takes you longer. You need to work at your own pace and work at the rate that you need. Start earlier, get tutoring help, etc. do what you need to do for you to be successful.\n\nGood luck with your studies!",

Here is the reply: \n\n_Due to the diverse background of our students, we encourage each student to contact EGBC directly regarding your qualifications.  Course outline information on each of our courses are listed online for review.  Your professional designation will be dependent on a combination of our courses and your previous education/experiences._\n\nThen I emailed EGBC, and they said I would have to take exams afterwards. Here is the reply: \n\n_The Bachelor of Technology in Environmental Engineering from BCIT is not an accredited degree according to Engineers Canada. \nApplicants with this degree are assigned exams after a detailed academic assessment._\n\nI am not sure if it\u2019s worth taking the program and depending on exams. I am concerned about something changing in the next few years. Do you know if the professors help prepare the students for said exams?",

I would suggest just taking a random intro course to meet your IRCC requirements.\n\nFor example:\nhttps://www.bcit.ca/courses/essentials-of-marketing-mktg-1102/\n\nBut you may or may not have to declare this program with BCIT to be able to register. You can declare as many part time programs. They honestly don't care as long as you pay the application fee... and they'll definitely approve you. It's just a matter of processing it. I think you should act quick though.",

So it's important to submit your graduation form before you request an official transcript. Otherwise they will all be bunched together. \nHope this makes sense.",

I've been in your shoes before so I know what it's like... they should give students like a compensation fee for having to go through this hassle.

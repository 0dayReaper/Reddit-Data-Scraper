The certificate program is more of an intensive studio environment with multiple courses taught by the same instructor over the course of the day/week.\n\nThe diploma program has a greater number of courses taught by many different instructors with more specific knowledge and experience with each subject.\n\nMany students who take the certificate program go on to apply for the diploma program, and are excellent students. \n\nYou can certainly go and work after graduating from the certificate program, but you would find that the diploma will give you a much more advanced understanding of architectural design and construction.",

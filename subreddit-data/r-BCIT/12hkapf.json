We spent most of our time together, we'd go out for dinner together, eat lunch together, etc. We had a facebook (it'd be discord now) where we talked about every test and assignment.\n\nI kept in touch with a few of them after grad but we mostly drifted apart. I still have one solid friend from BCIT, we chat every day and help each other with our careers.\n\nOutside of my program, I don't think I ever talked to anyone at BCIT.",

(coming from someone who studied engineering at ubc and now CST at bcit). \nMajor difference I noticed - atleast for me - people are here because they want to, and they have a better idea of what they want in life. level of ambition is different than ubc. mentality is better and more positive here. This is just my personal experience anyways. \n\nI know the fact that the classes are smaller and u stay with those ppl def plays a crucial part",

            "comment": "Tbh, the social and Networking aspect will all boil down to you. \n\nStudents will say no social because BCIT is fast paced and the amount of load being given is high. But that is up to you, in my opinion. \n\nIf you really want to build a network then start it with yourself, be open with people and grab any opportunities you can get or build that opportunity.",

This is best place to socialize and the students here are so much sociable and they always help out each other. I don't think any institution has more social life than Capilano University.",

Came here to study 1 year certificate but with the social life I am getting now I am doing Bachelors of 4 years.",

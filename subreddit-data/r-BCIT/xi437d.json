    "postText": "Recently I have been thinking on going back to school. I graduated Mining Tech last year and have been working in a mine lab ever since. Growing up I always wanted to work in this field but just scared of the interview portion and deter to go to my current field. However now that I am getting older and heck not getting paid enough to live without constant OT I am thinking about pursuing this maybe by 2024. I have all the requirements needed and upgraded my gr12 calculus math 3 yrs ago with high 90s. I am just curious of I should upgrade my chemistry or what not. Thank you for advice.",

            "comment": "My grades were 8yrs old and I didn't bother upgrading and got in with mid 90s. As long as you did well in the required courses they take the average of that I think. Always pick your highest grades when applying. I had post secondary courses that were high like my English course so used that and the rest were my HS marks. I heard from someone that got mid 80s and 3rd percentile on Casper didn't get invited to the \"MMI\" (basically an assessment to see if you can differentiate stuff like colour or objects). So depending on the ppl applying grades might matter alot.",

I got into the program for the current intake with mid-high 80s in most of my classes and like 78% in chemistry. \n\nThe grades are just to weed out some of the candidates as they see a lot of applications. The interview is what determines who gets into the program! Honestly, I was stressing about the interview as well, but they switched it during COVID to an online quiz type thing, rather than the traditional MMI, that was a lot less stressful. By 2024, I don\u2019t know if they will go back to the traditional MMI, or if they will keep this version, but it\u2019d probably be good to prepare for both",

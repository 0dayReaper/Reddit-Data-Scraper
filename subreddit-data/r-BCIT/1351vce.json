I\u2019ve been struggling to land on entry level drafter position in Vancouver and looking to get CAD certificate at BCIT hoping that it helps to get myself in the industry. I\u2019ve been hearing good thing about BCIT graduates being referred by profs or getting permanent role from the internships. \nPeople who took this course, would you recommend taking it? How difficult was it to land on the job?",

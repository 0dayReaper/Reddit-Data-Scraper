I'm currently doing a diploma program and am hoping to transfer to a different university to finish my bachelors (don't give me shit for my plan, please, I have bad high school grades and so I need to do a post-secondary transfer), and I'm interested to know how that'll affect my chances. TIA.",

            "comment": "V is considered 0.00 GPA. I had many Vs in my transcript. UBC only looks at your most recent 30 credits; however, unfortunately all BCIT classes are not transferable according to the BC transfer guide. You probably need to go to VCC Langara etc. Keep in mind, if you have finished a high-level course, calculus 3 for example, you cannot retake calculus 1 for UBC application. They will ask all of your transcripts.  On the other hand, if you have failed Cal 1, you can retake it. As long as you have a very high GPA for the most recent 30 credits, UBC will accept you.",

Unless you want to finish a BCIT degree and moving on UBC masters. My friend got an offer from UBC, he had a terrible GPA in the past as mine (many Vs and Cs), but he applied with a good GPA for the most recent 30 credits",

It does not matter which school you study, how bad your transcript is, once you get your cpa certificate, you will make a lot of money, but before that, either you cannot find a related job or find a entry level bookkeeper with minimum wage.",

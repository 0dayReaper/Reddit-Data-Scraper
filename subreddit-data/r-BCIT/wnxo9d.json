    "postText": "Hey there all, going to be studying at BCIT this upcoming September and was wondering if anyone could give advice / suggestions on parking. \n\nI am probably going to be opting in for monthly passes at BCIT but was wondering if anyone else has any opinions / advice on parking at BCIT. I am going to be mainly at the Business faculty and going to be going there early around 7~ to work out before I start attending classes at 9:30~\n\nThank you!",

I arrived at 7:05-7:10-ish a few times and I was late for my 7:30 class because of not being able to find parking.",

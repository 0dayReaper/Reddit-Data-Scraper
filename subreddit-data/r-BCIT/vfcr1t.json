    "postText": "EDIT: I talked to the nurse and they just had me submit what I can, and all else will be communicated through email.\n\nI got conditionally accepted by a program that requires an immunization review, but I don't have any records of my immunizations. None at all. Should I just put that in the forms and submit it right away?\n\nIf they will schedule me for an appointment for an immunization review at BCIT, will it be after the submission deadline for the forms? In my case, deadline is August 7, 2022. Is there a chance of being scheduled for an immunization review at BCIT before above deadline if I submit my forms early?",

This could depend on where you got them I suppose because I had all mine done in BC but I couldn't find physical records. If you can't find them on the website, maybe try contacting the nurses at BCIT because when I did they were extremely helpful and pretty flexible with what can be done.\n\nAlso I heard that the immunization review is something done after the term starts at least for my program which is radiation therapy but I don't know if it differs across programs",

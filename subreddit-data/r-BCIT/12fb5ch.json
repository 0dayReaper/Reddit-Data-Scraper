    "postText": "Hey! I recently got accepted at Douglas College to pursue Digital Marketing but lately I\u2019ve been thinking about New Media Design at BCIT. The program seems like a better fit for me: a graphic designer. I previously took a 3-month bootcamp to become one and I was able to land a junior designer role.\n\nNow with New Media, I think I\u2019ll be able to learn more and cultivate my skills further. I also want to focus more on UI/UX. But I don\u2019t know if I should make the switch (also, it depends if there\u2019s a slot since there\u2019s a long waitlist) since I\u2019m getting the impression that it\u2019s a longer version of the bootcamp that I\u2019ve taken. \n\nAnother consideration is getting a job after. If I pursued Digital Marketing, then I\u2019m worried I might not be able to get a designer role? I do have a portfolio but Canada seems to favor Canadian experience and education first and foremost.\n\nJust to put it out there, here are some skills I do want to learn tho: an updated knowledge on UI/UX, Figma, and Motion Graphics. These weren\u2019t covered in the bootcamp so, I would love to hear thoughts about this! \n\nThanks in advance!",

A program that has a co-op or internship (where they don't leave you alone to find a job) is going to be better than anything else.\n\nBasically, I'd do a program that gets my foot in the door somewhere.\n\nThere's also lots of UX / ui / design jobs that are remote through Canada, but again, foot in the door.",

The entry level designer market is flooded, so your best bet is trying to get into something through connections unless you want incredibly crappy pay. Going to school is good for internship possibilities but don't bet on it. It could end up being a waste of time and money.",

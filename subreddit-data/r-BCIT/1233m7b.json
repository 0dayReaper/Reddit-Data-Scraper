    "postText": "I recently applied (a week ago) to the HVAC diploma program and I understand that the intake is in April. What are the chances I will get into the next intake which would be next April? \n\nWould it be easier to try and apply to HVAC companies in hopes of getting into the trade green? Any help would be welcome, as I am transitioning into trades.\n\nApologies if these questions have been asked before, but I am very curious and have no clue even how to see how long the waitlist is.",

Things are gonna start ramping up soon with cooling season, so if you want a job just start knocking on doors looking like you\u2019re ready to work and tell them that you\u2019re willing to do what it takes. \n\nI have an email address for someone at the union who sent out my resume to different companies. Dm me if you\u2019re interested.\n\nFYI, if you get a union job they\u2019ll pay for your schooling too.",

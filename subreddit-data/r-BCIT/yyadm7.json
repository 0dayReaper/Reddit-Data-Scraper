So basically my physics grade is kinda shit right now (75%) I can definitely get it to at least mid to high 80s by the end of the course, but by then will it be too late? By too late I mean will submitting it that late hurt my chances more than submitting with my current grade? Cuz it will still be before the deadline, but only by a week or two.",

My question was about submitting a shitty midterm mark right now vs waiting a few months and submitting a final mark (that will be better if everything goes to plan) at the last minute.",

I had an average 20 percent higher than one of my high school class mates and I got waitlisted and he got accepted because he applied a lot earlier. Just apply. Also the 200 character boxes don\u2019t mean much maybe they are for for estimating courses you haven\u2019t taken yet. Also take calculus in high school . Probably 80 percent of the failing grades in first term calc were people that didn\u2019t take it in high school. \n\nCheers and good luck. This program will be your life for 4 years",

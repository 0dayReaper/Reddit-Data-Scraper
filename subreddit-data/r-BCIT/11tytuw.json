    "postText": "So I am looking to apply for the CST Diploma for the January \u201824 intake. I was notified applications opened up two days ago so I thought I\u2019d come here and ask a few questions. After Graduating in 2020 during Covid I\u2019ve decided to come back to school and so i am currently taking pre cal 12 as per the entrance requirements. Should I wait to apply until I\u2019m finished that in June or should I apply now and explain I\u2019m still actively taking the class. I also don\u2019t have the preferred \u201ccomputer class\u201d 11,12 but if it\u2019s a deal breaker I am more than willing to bomb through a course or subscribe to something like \u201cCodecademy\u201d for over the summer to be up to snuff with the rest of the applicants. The intake closes August of this year so I could just wait but understanding how competitive the field is I\u2019d love to give myself the best shot at getting in. \n\nAny input would be appreciated",

Would you have time to take Computer Science/Programming 11&amp;12 before August 28 anyway? As far as I can tell, I don't think you can just take any random course.\n\nYou can apply anytime before the August deadline as BCIT won't look at applicants until after the deadline date (for competitive entry programs). Definitely don't wait until the last minute; applying right you get your final grade in June would be good.",

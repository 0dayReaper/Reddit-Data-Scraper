There's a lot of anecdotes with people in CIT that get software developer jobs if that what you're interested in and there's co-op.  \n\n\nI heard not so good things about cypersecurity, so I recommend CIT.",

They should be able to give you a waiver for the application fee so you dont need to pay again, and also let you know what you need to do next. \n\nThe 1st (early) deadline was september 1st 2022 and the next deadline is october 30th 2022 (final). Good luck!!\n\nEdit: just realized xancat was talking about last year, but the deadlines i mentioned are for this year for the 2023 program",

    "postText": "I am currently upgrading my math and English to apply for CST full-time, but I only *just* surpassed 50% completion for both courses. The last day for this year's fall intake is on Monday, and I stupidly missed the advisory office hours to double-check if I can submit midterm grades. I've sent the form from the website's *Using Your Midterm Grades* page to my math and English upgrading instructors, but I can't find any clarification in the program outline on whether or not I can actually apply to CST full-time using midterm grades.\n\nTIA for the help.",

I believe there's more to the school experience than sacrificing your mental health and life outside of studying to graduate faster. The full time programs at BCIT are like a version of Squid Game. Do you really want to suffer when there are other ways?",

It looks like today's form is the same as it was then, so I would do whatever I could to have that form filled out ASAP since the deadline is on Monday.\n\nIf you're unsure of that form being ready for Monday, call admissions; they're very helpful and I got all my questions answered same-day.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m going to be taking BHSC 1200 in the summer! I was wondering if anyone had any study tips because I heard this course is very dense and content heavy! I heard that the professor doesn\u2019t really provide PowerPoints so I was wondering if anyone had any study tips! I\u2019m in my first year of post secondary and so far most of my professors have provided PowerPoints and I usually studied off of them.",

PowerPonts not very useful, without context,  you probably will not understand them. Topic on histology, muscle contraction (Na+, K+,Ca2+, troponin, tropomyosin, actin and myosin , function of cranial nerves, how Na+ and K+ pass through the axon, relationship between hypothalamus, pineal glands, thyroid hormone, cardiovascular system cardio systole, P, QRS, and T waves, blood circulation (eg, how deoxygenated blood pick up oxygen, blood pass through which cardio valves), respiratory ventilation (Pressure outside and inside your lung), are very important. Exam will ask question on these topic over and over. Good luck.",

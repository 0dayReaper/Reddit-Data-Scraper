If you are a CST diploma grad then you should be fine.   \n\n\nFor the Curriculum, I didn't heard any drastic changes but heard that they are contemplating in adding more math (mainly calculus) to be more competitive with other Unis. The current Diploma and Bachelors for CS at BCIT lacks the math that most CS programs in other unis have.",

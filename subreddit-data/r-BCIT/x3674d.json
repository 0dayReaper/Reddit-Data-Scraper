    "postText": "I am an international student planning to apply to Bcit CST program for fall\u201923. I have yet to give my 12th grade board exams. My 11th grade\u2019s final transcript has grades in letter grade in which I have A+ and a gpa of 5.00 out of 5.00 on all subjects with which I plan to apply early along with my ielts score. I have ICT grades to show too. \nIs there any chance of me getting in even if I apply early? Really want to get in this program :((",

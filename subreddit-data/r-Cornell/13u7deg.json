I\u2019m a rising sophomore and I was looking through my housing license for next year and it said that the license begins on August 17th, so I think we might only be able to start moving in at that time? There\u2019s like exceptions if you\u2019re part of certain programs like being an Orientation Leader and can move in earlier, but I think, in general, we might not be allowed to move in on the 14th and 15th since they\u2019ll be reserved for first-years. I\u2019m not super sure though, but I\u2019m just relying on what the license says. Good luck!",

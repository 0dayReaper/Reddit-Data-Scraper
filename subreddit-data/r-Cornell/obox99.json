Obviously, still much better than not getting vaccinated.\n\nHowever, AstraZeneca has that same 90% reduction figure, and the UK (where AZ is the most popular vaccine) is still seeing a massive outbreak with no signs of slowing down. \n\nWhile getting vaccinated is infinitely better than not, it\u2019s still to be seen if it can truly stop the delta variant, which will probably be the most dominant in the US by the time we move in in the fall. People who are fully vaccinated are still dying and having much more frequent hospitalizations than with other variants.\n\nI sincerely hope that our vaccine mandate will work in keeping delta off our campus, but it\u2019s a completely different monster compared to past variants and until we know more i\u2019d hope, for the sake of immunocompromised people on campus, that we air on the side of caution.\n\nTLDR: I appreciate the optimism, but I think y\u2019all are underestimating how bad delta could be, even in Ithaca",

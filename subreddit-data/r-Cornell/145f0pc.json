Still, it\u2019s always been my dream to go there as an astronomy student. In early July of this year, me and my family are planning to go there! I already know a good amount of things I want to do, but I was wondering if there were any activities that people could recommend me to do.\n\nThanks for reading! :)\n\nThese ideas all sound great and I will surely try them out!",

Drinking, drugs and backgammon were my favorite activities at Cornell, but others might have different suggestions. The Botanical Gardens, called the Plantations in the 90s, was always fun for picnics.",

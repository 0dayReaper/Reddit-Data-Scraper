    "postText": "Hi! I forgot to cancel a flix bus ticket for tomorrow that I can no longer use. It leaves from Green Street at 8:30 am and arrives near Penn station around 1:10 PM. Flixbus is going to charge me a hefty cancellation fee, so I'd rather just transfer it to someone who could use it. It's $40 (can negotiate) \u2014 same ticket is selling right now for $80.

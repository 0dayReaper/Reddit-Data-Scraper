In some of those cases, you get wool robes with legit velvet tams and stoles. Those are nice... but very hot. (Under the lights on a stage or out in the sun you will sweat a lot.)\n\nBut undergrad and masters robes? Usually nice and light, not usually in the school's colors, and rarely bought. Be thankful for that flimsiness; sometimes sitting in the sun in Schoellkopf gets a bit warm. Congrats to everyone who is graduating!",

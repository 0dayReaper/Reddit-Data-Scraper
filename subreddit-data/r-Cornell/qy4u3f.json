    "postText": "TW sexual assault \n\nThis is kind of a long shot- but last night i was walking home and in front of 626 a car pulled over and asked if i was ok. I was not. I was legitimately sobbing, there was blood all over my legs and I was trying to get back to ctown with a locked phone. I really am just making this post because the two people who drove me home, I legitimately think you saved my life and I am so thankful and while I kept saying it in the car I don\u2019t think it was emphasized enough. So if you drove a severely emotional clearly traumatized girl from north to ctown last night: thank you so much. you truly are what\u2019s right with humanity\n\nEDIT: hi everyone thanks so much for the kind words \u2764\ufe0f i did get medical help and i\u2019m heading home for thanksgiving break a few days earlier than planned. Sending love everyone\u2019s way, stay safe.",

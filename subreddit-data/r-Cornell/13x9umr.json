    "postText": "Saw a post about how ppl met their SO at Cornell. Really sweet but I\u2019m curious about the other side: How do couples who end up doing long distance work? How does it go usually? I know at least two couples in my friend circle split up because of graduation and moving to different states. Kind of in a similar situation (graduated before my SO and they have a job lined up in another state) and idk what to do \ud83e\udd74",

Our first date was after graduation, and she had taken a job out west while I was committed to a job in NY. We visited each other about once a month for a year. We called each other almost every night. She moved back to NY after a year. Now we\u2019re married with a house and our first child. Its possible, just has to be the right person",

            "comment": "My sweetie and I broke up due to physical distance, but the breakup only lasted a month or so (met new people, realized nobody came close) and we ended up being long distance more often than not by the time we got married. \n\nI think whether or not you can handle it, and whether or not it\u2019s worthwhile, and whether you grow apart or together, depends on the individual and the couple. There comes a point where most people prefer to be together, so if the separation has an end point or a purpose that benefits both, that is more likely to result in the relationship working out longer-term. (The successful long-term long-distance relationships I\u2019ve seen have been from poly friends, which is a pretty different situation.)",

Thankfully, I\u2019m only 5 hours away so it\u2019s not too bad and we\u2019ve been together for over 3 years, so we\u2019re in this for the long haul and long distance it was something we both knew was coming. I\u2019m incredibly Type A, so it makes me feel better to have a schedule of how to keep in touch (talking every day, eating dinner over FT a few times per week, visits every 2-3 weeks, etc.). We\u2019re also starting these relationship audits every month, where we are completely honest about what is and is not working in the relationship sans judgment. With a schedule and honest communication, I hope that we\u2019re setting ourselves up for success",

We see each other as often as possible but sometimes life gets in the way. We can go from seeing each other every week to going for about a month or two without seeing each other. Sometimes it is hard, but we manage to make it work.",

            "comment": "Bad. My situation is a little different. I had a SO before coming to Cornell. Things were pretty solid until my senior year when she graduated a year earlier than me from her university and wanted to kinda start fresh with her new position, focus on herself, and kinda stop dealing with the distance. It kinda crushed me, but hey it's life. I have graduated and returned back to my home state, but I'm heading to grad school. So the possibility of trying to rekindle that relationship is kinda low. I hate to use the cliche, but if u love something, u gotta set it free and blah blah blah u know the rest lol. Everything happens for a reason, and who knows maybe y'all would come back together one day \ud83d\udc40.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Premature response \ud83d\ude02",

I still think about it. No one else is like him. I still miss who we were. \n\nFinding someone special is like a lighting strike. You think maybe it can't work and you'll find someone else because there's billions of people in the world, but there's only one of each person. Could we all be happy with someone else? Probably. Will you encounter someone else that is right for you? Will circumstances be right again? \n\nI would be careful making your decision. A great relationship with real feelings and connnection is precious. It's not nearly as easy to come by as people imply, especially out of college when your opportunities for meeting new people are fewer.\n\nI get that people are advising you to call it off. But it doesn't matter what they say, it matters how you feel. Would you rather try or break up? You might get over each other quickly. You might spend the rest of your lives wondering if they were the one. \n\nI was the one dumped, so I didn't get the chance to choose, I got a broken heart and a metric for all other relationships. All I look for in a partner is someone like him, but a version that will stay. If you left, would this person be a metric to which you measured all other realtionships? I still wonder if we could've made it if we'd tried.\n\nSorry for the novel. Obvi this is a situation in which I have the inverse of your perspective. Best of luck, whatever you decide.",

I\u2019m sure you deserve better and you will find someone who loves u and u love - even if it might take some time \u2764\ufe0f \n\nFor me I feel like I wouldn\u2019t find another relationship that\u2019s so pure and precious like this one, bc it was my first relationship, we met from the first day of college (but I graduated early), and my SO has such a pure soul that is the exact opposite of my family and all people around me where I grew up. They made me a new person, more confident, and know what I actually want for myself.\n\nSometimes I wonder if it\u2019s worth to just commit to my first ever relationship or I should go into the society and try something new. Yet sometimes I feel like it would be a shame to leave what I have now, although LDR is painful for me. Well now I guess I\u2019ll just see how it goes\u2026",

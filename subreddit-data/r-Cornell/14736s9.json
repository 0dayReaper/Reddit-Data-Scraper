Ur major and experience matters for sure but prep matters even more. Start reading the greenbook, heard on the street, grind probability/dice type problems, be able to do leetcode. Try participating in quant trading competitions hosted by companies -  World Quant Brain,  Jane Street Estimathon, UChicago/UC Berk Trading Competitions, etc - these are open to all students. Good luck!",

I had a centipede harassing me for months, and it would not leave even after I sprayed the entire room. Also, there was no AC and my heating was broken, so I experienced the extremes of heat as well as bitter cold. The only upside was the residents, who are mostly upperclassmen and pretty quiet. If you still have time, avoid a basement room at all costs!1!",

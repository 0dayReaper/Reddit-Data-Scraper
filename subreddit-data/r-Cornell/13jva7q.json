            "comment": "I can't speak to course selection, but for pre-enroll make sure you open student center and put all your desired courses in your cart the day before pre-enroll. Make sure the classes you're adding have open slots, anything that's full won't work for the next step.\n\nOn the day of pre-enroll, log into the system BEFORE pre-enroll starts so you can click \"next\" and \"enroll\" in your cart right at the moment it's available. Like, 1-2 seconds after the clock strikes 7am or whatever time it is.\n\nType your password into a word document and copy it so if you get logged out, you can log back in really quickly. You might not get all the classes you want, but you can always try to get different sections if they are available during the next few hours. If you decide to switch sections or courses, don't drop the course and add another since the class could fill up in between dropping and adding. Use the \"replace\"/\"switch\" function and select the old and new course so you only drop the course if the new one is enrolled.\n\nAlso there are plenty of options to rearrange things during add/drop so don't stress too much if you don't get exactly what you want.",

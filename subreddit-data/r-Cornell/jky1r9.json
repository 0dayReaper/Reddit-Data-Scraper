    "postText": "\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt's really touching to see all of your love and support for Fumi and Cafe Pacific. An alumna, Karen Perez ('19), has created a [Gofundme](https://gf.me/u/y6z8vi). Please consider donating if you aren't in the Ithaca area. Together we can save Cafe Pacific! \n\nFumi (the owner) has approved of the fundraiser. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCafe Pacific is Collegetown\u2019s best kept secret. But sadly, the owner is considering shutting down the business. She told me she was barely able to survive this past summer, given how empty Ithaca was, and that this school year hasn\u2019t brought as much business as she expected. She\u2019s been there for over 10 years, and I\u2019d hate to see her run out of business because of COVID.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, Cafe Pacific is located across the street from Mango Mango and serves a variety of Japanese comfort dishes, desserts, and boba. The food is always delicious and the prices are fair. But above all, the owner is honestly one of the kindest people I\u2019ve ever met. She always makes an effort to talk to her customers and takes random acts of kindness to the next level. For example, when I ate there yesterday, she brought me and my friends an assortment of free cakes after discovering it was one of our birthdays!\n\nYes, the atmosphere is a little dingy, and the wait times can sometimes be a little excessive. But she essentially runs the whole restaurant on her own. She dedicates her life to serving this community. I say it's time to return the favor. So let's help her out during these trying times!\n\nHere's some additional info about Cafe Pacific if you\u2019re thinking about going:\n\n* They deliver on [ithacatogo](https://www.ithacatogo.com/restaurants?collapsable=1)\n* Also can order online through [paywithway](https://paywithway.com)\n* They\u2019re open 2PM-12AM, Sunday-Thursday and 2PM-1 AM, Friday-Saturday\n* Consider paying with cash! Cash is always better for small businesses because credit card fees = :(",

            "comment": "I\u2019m working at Cafe Pacific on Fridays and Saturdays (6:00 to 9:00) as a cashier. Wait times should be (slightly) faster but if a lot of people order at once it might be a bit tricky. \n\nIf you want to order online, please call us directly for pickup if you can (607-277-7700). It\u2019s better for us that way since we get more money on our end.\n\nSeating inside is actually a bit hard on us. Technically the government health department or whoever said that we can\u2019t host people in there (I\u2019ve asked Fumi if it\u2019s okay with social distancing but she\u2019s adamant about only having one or two parties there).\n\nFor those asking, the best thing to buy is bubble tea or snacks from the counter, since it\u2019s quick and easy for us to make. For food, a noodle dish or curry is also really good.\n\nThank you so much for posting this and for everyone caring so much. We talk a lot when there\u2019s down time during the shift (it\u2019s good Japanese practice). She\u2019s been going through a lot lately, having a really difficult time paying rent. It really touching that so many people care. I hope to see all of you guys there.",

Cafe Pacific was always my favorite spot and the owner is an absolute sweetheart.\n\nI have corny and mushy memories as an alum now, but I have this particular memory from Cafe Pacific a few years back.  I returned to campus early one semester when I still lived in the dorms to get started doing research.  Because dorms weren't open yet, I crashed at a friend's place in Fall Creek.  The walk back was long and it was consistently snowing for the week I was there, so I stopped by Cafe Pacific on the way back to my friend's place for a warm meal before turning in for the night (I didn't feel right intruding in on using their kitchen).  The owner always treated me well and one time offered me free dessert too!  Whenever I returned subsequently she always asked me how I was doing with my classes and my clubs!\n\nShe truly is a Collegetown treasure and must be saved at all costs.",

She sometimes call me even after I moved out to California, and I just got her call today. She said she may need to close the cafe at college town soon because of the low business. She wants to keep the current place, but it is really hard in the current situation and she has started to think about moving out to a new place with low rent (she said still in Ithaca, but not in college town).. She also said that her friends helped create a new website of the cafe, and opened the fundraising ([Gofundme](https://gf.me/u/y6z8vi)), so I was looking for the details after the call and found this website. She really appreciated all the help and was actually surprised to see the growing fund. That said, the current amount is not enough for her to keep the current place, especially until COVID is over and the business is back to normal. So, I am wondering how the fund can be raised more for her. I will contact my friends I met in Cornell to spread the fundraising info, and please let me know if you have any good idea to raise the fund. Thank you for reading this message!!",

It was my favourite spot in all of campus and I used to dine there almost twice a week, Hifumi (I think that's how you spell her name?) always treated me very nicely, and would even remember my order every time I visited. She even gave me free food on my birthday. I can't believe it's gone, and I wish I could see her to thank her for everything- that place really was a haven for me",

Move-in may be 4 or 8 days to accommodate\n-\tReactivation of key card and NetID requires completing a checklist\n\n**Quarantine/Isolation/Contact Tracing**\n\n-\tQuarantine at permanent residence or Ithaca hotels, including possibly the Statler\n-\t\u201cStudents should be provided immunity from university disciplinary violations for activities they disclose during contact tracing\u201d\n\n**Modifications to Academic Activities**\n\n-\tLater start to the school year, no breaks\n-\t2 modes of instruction: all online, and in-person with remote access\n-\tClassroom capacity reduced to 13-24%\n-\tWear masks in classroom, sit in assigned seats (bruh)\n-\tVirtual OH encouraged\n-\tBarton Hall or other large spaces repurposed as quiet study spaces to limit gatherings elsewhere\n-\tRegular grading reinstated\n-\tAttendance shouldn\u2019t be counted for credit but should be taken to facilitate contact tracing\n-\tRecommend a stricter cap to 18 credit hours for mental health\n-\tOrientation should focus on behavioral expectations\n\n**Modifications to student life**\n\n-\tStudent Organizations encouraged to do virtual activities, among other considerations\n-\tGreek Life: \u201cThe university should develop an addendum\nto the Risk Management and Social Events\nPolicy that requires compliance with NYS\nand local public health guidelines; wearing\nmasks when there are visitors in the house;\nregistration of public health monitors for\nevents; coordination with SCL to ensure\nvendors are healthy and safe; and\nregistering the addresses of chapter\nannexes.\u201d\n    - \u201cSome advocated for strict enforcement with\nstrong sanctions, while others caution against\nrisks of pushing activities \u201cunderground\u201d where\nthey may be more difficult to enforce.\nGreek leaders expressed desire to be involved in\nenforcement of behavioral expectations and\nmaintain close partnership with university\nleadership. \u201c\n-\t\u201cThe university should suspend in-person\nconcerts and lectures that involve outside\nguests and promote innovative approaches\nto entirely new ways of socializing while\ndistancing.\u201d\n\n**Housing**\n\n-\tEliminate quads and triples.\n-\tRooms assigned to bathrooms to reduce # of people sharing\n-\tLounges and kitchens remain open\n-\tDining halls provide to-go service, tables properly spaced, cutlery disposable, reservations required for dine-in\n\n**De-densification**\n\n-\t\u201cCampus can be de-densified by inviting only\nsome or none of students back for\nresidential instruction. If this option is\npursued, the following student groups\nshould be given priority: new students,\nincluding transfer students; residential\nadvisors; graduating seniors (especially in\nthe spring); athletes (if competition will take\nplace for their sport); and students who would not otherwise be able to maintain\nacademic progress without access to\ncampus such as students in programs that\nrequire hands-on access to special facilities\nand those who lack access to internet or\nquiet learning spaces at home\u201d\n    - Comments on this suggest it is not ideal. That is to say, they are proposing this as an option but NOT saying it is what should be done. In fact, the committee recommends AGAINST doing this. \n\n**\u201dCampaign for Public Health and Behavioral Influence Strategies\u201d**\n\n-\t\u201cRecommend a system of progressive\nsanctions. Initial response would involve\njust the student and be educational.\nSubsequent violations would involve\nparent/legal guardian, if the student has\nsigned a FERPA waiver. Students could lose\naccess to university facilities and ultimately\nbe referred to the Office of the Judicial\nAdministrator for repeated violations that\nnecessitate formal discipline or removal\nfrom enrollment\u201d",

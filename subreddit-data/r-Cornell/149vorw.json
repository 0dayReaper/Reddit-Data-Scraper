    "postText": "I\u2019m a transfer student coming in as a sophomore.  I just got assigned a single in Founders Hall. There are online dorm tours of many buildings, but alas, not this one. I\u2019ve read bad things about the gothics \u2026 from bugs, to floods, to dark claustrophobic hallways, to lonely existences.  I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s not what\u2019s in store for me.  Please, say it ain\u2019t so!  Any insight would be appreciated.",

It\u2019s not too bad (some of the other Gothics are much worse) and you will also be living on west as a sophomore, which is very desirable and should help you make friends as a transfer.",

Maybe you could reach out to the welcome center and see if there is a process that lets you visit early? Also, another positive about founders is that the rooms are usually a little larger than normal!",

    "postText": "Hi! I have lost my card holder last night. I recalled clearly I used it at le cafe cent dexi around 8:00 PM and then my friend and I went to a movie at CINEMAPOLIS. I was planning to go back to Boston this morning but bcs of this, I decided to spend another morning in Ithaca. Hope I can find some luck!\n\nFor le cafe cent dexi, unfortunately, they close for the next week. I wonder if someone can help me contact the owner. I would be more than grateful.\n\nFor cinemapolis, I hope to go there before I leave but do let me know if there is any way I can contact them early.\n\nWelcome all suggestions!\n\nThank you in advance.",

            "comment": "If you saw the bat fly in, and it did not touch you, you are not at risk of rabies. Personally, I would call the Cornell wildlife hospital and ask them to connect you to someone with experience with rabies vector species. Cornell doesn\u2019t see rabies vector species, but they can connect you to rehabber who may be able to come out to catch the bat and release it back outside. I highly doubt that the health department would send anybody to catch this animal given that there has not been a true rabies exposure. I also don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason for you to try to kill the bat yourself, as suggested by others, because that will just potentially expose you to getting bitten if you do not have any animal experience. I also think there is no reason for the bat to die, since it did not bite anybody. My two cents as a vet.",

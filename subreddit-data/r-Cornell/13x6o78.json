    "postText": "So I got a TO from CAS for their economics program. I am confused as to how I'm supposed to meet the requirements for the major and what they even are. Will I get an email saying what classes I need to take during my freshmen year at the school I'm going to or will I be able to talk to someone from Cornell and like match up course requirements? I'm just so stressed out and confused. I've only seen people talk about the TO from CALS, and not CAS and there isn't a lot of information on it",

You have to get really good at searching the internet and websites to drill down to what you need. And you'll need to get good at asking for help from the department. And it's summer and you may not hear from some people for weeks. Don't give up!",

Since you got a TO, you would enter as a sophomore, well before you need to declare a major. You can take all the required courses for your major once you get here. Just take general education stuff and a writing course. You'll be fine.",

    "postText": "I'm a TO student coming to CALS this fall (c/o 26). I have recently learned that Cornell's new student move-in (8/14-8/15) conflicts with the tail end of my EMT course schedule (ends on 8/17, including a skills session and important exams). For now, I have gotten into contact with my instructor and the EMT folks to see if I can adjust my course schedule. In the event that that is not possible, however, could I receive permission to arrive late?",

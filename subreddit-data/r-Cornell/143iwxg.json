I think interning away from your university town is fairly typical. \n\nWe\u2019re not in the Silicon Valley, but being local usually isn\u2019t a concern for recruiters. They\u2019re just sending a couple of people for a day or two, which they do at plenty of schools throughout the year and regardless of location. It isn\u2019t a huge ask, especially when Ithaca isn\u2019t exactly an isolated prairie.",

I've known people who got summer internships in NYC, in the bay area, in Texas, in Seattle... in that regard, it doesn't really matter where your college is located. Nothing stops you from applying to internships far away.",

Another great thing is that during your last round of interviews many companies will fly you out to meet you in person. This is a nice overnight stay and flight and then return to Ithaca! Not only that but if you have to relocate for an internship you also will receive housing and travel stipends which are nice bonuses for your hard work! Ithaca is fine for recruiting! It sucks for the recruiters coming to the career fairs \ud83d\ude02",

We are lucky enough to have alumni who have succeeded in their jobs and because of that companies believe we will as well. Not only that, but as they get to meet the students in the school environment they witness our true selves rather then a fixed image on a computer. Lastly recruiters expenses are covered by the respective companies and the recruiters are often alumni who want to connect with the students",

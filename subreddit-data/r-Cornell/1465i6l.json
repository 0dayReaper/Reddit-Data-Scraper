So if your minor in InfoSci is all stuff like Designing Tech for Social Impact, HCI Design, Novel Interaction Techniques, etc. you\u2019d be fine. If it\u2019s all Data Sci you may run into issues, and those may work better as technical electives. As for language classes, afaik should be fine too if it\u2019s 3000+.",

    "postText": "Selling a 5.6 cubic foot capacity mini fridge - 34x23x23. I'm graduating and don't need a mini fridge anymore, but used it in dorms and in ctown housing and it has been very reliable. Great fridge for food or drinks (fits 24 White Claws in the bottom compartment perfectly), can adjust temperature and has a tiny freezer compartment inside. You would just need to transport yourself/ pick it up from Collegetown. Selling for $75 but happy to discuss - message me if interested!\n\nThis is the current link to it on Home Depot [https://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-5-6-cu-ft-Mini-Fridge-in-White-GCE06GGHWW/205508772](https://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-5-6-cu-ft-Mini-Fridge-in-White-GCE06GGHWW/205508772) but can send pictures in messaging!",

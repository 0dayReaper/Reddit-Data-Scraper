    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI have some limited coding experience, I got a 5 in CSP and done some limited python stuff so I was wondering if it was worth it to work through the 1110 course now until Cornell starts to try to place out of it and start with 2110?\n\nI say this because I honestly don\u2019t really have much to do this summer, but more so I can try to get ahead. I have a friend who recently got a job at Amazon as a freshman and I was trying to do the same. I heard that at cornell, CS2110 is basically what jobs would expect Jr. Developers to be able to do, however I\u2019m afraid that if I do the normal track, my interviews would have already been done and over by the time I take 2110 in the spring.\n\nI just want to maximize my future as much as possible. Anything helps! Also if internship interviews are more in the spring, then I wouldn\u2019t mind doing the normal path because I would have already been able to complete a good amount of cs2110 in the spring.\n\nOn top of that, I also want to join a couple of clubs at Cornell and I\u2019m not sure if I would get accepted into them given my limited experience. Cornell Quant Fund, The Blockhain Club and Cayuga Capital to name a few. \n\nAnything helps, thank you so much!",

            "comment": "jeez man, this probably isn't the advice you are looking for but you should just relax and enjoy your summer then take a normal path your freshman year so you have time for clubs, making friends, and so on. \n\nthe only thing you will get from trying to rush through the UG curriculum is burnout. if you do well at a normal pace those high-profile  internships and jobs will still be accessible to you.\n\nthat being said, if you got a '5 in CSP' (is this AP CS? - what is CSP?) you probably can skip 1110. I'm fairly certain, at least when I was here, one could skip to 2110 w/ a 5 in ap cs \n\nfinally, and bit of a side-note - those freshman-summer FAANG internships are *generally* outreach programs for students from underrepresented backgrounds in tech. they are definitely real internships, but they are also less rigorous w/ less requirements due to the nature of the program. if you qualify, they aren't going to nail you in an interview on concepts you haven't had the time to learn yet.",

IMO this is better anyways as adjusting to college life (making friends, learning to self-regulate on your own, etc, etc.) takes up more time than you realize -- having a more standard workload puts you in a better position to learn how to be at cornell, manage life / grades to find a good optimization of both, etc.\n\nif you still *really* want to do something that benefits your career - work on a cool side project that is fun and gets you curious. with your skillset/experience level maybe something like full-stack web app idea and throw in some chatgpt api calls, or see if you can find any low-hanging fruit on open source. you will learn real-world technologies (etc.), have some shit to put on your resume, and pick up 1110 and 2110 concepts along the way. this is way better than the boring grind that would be studying for the case exam imo, but only do it if you'll still enjoy your summer\n\ngonna throw some mid 20s platitude crap at you here - I'm an alum, and I am friends with or otherwise know lots of people who *grinded* during their time at Cornell. Many of these people had their grind rewarded: they got great jobs that were super difficult to get. A lot of these people ended up miserable or dissatisfied, though - with some making a switch out. \n\nI mention this to you because it is very easy to have the mindset of, 'when I get into X club/project team/etc. i will be happy,' or, 'when I get my FAANG internship I will be happy' or, 'when I get my apple/goldman/bcg/etc. job I will be happy.' and never end up happy or satisfied. you have ~4 years of friendships, relationships, memories, and a whirlwind of emotions ahead of you. while I think it is great you are focused on your career, I implore you to not stress yourself out with career anxieties and to make your time at cornell memorable and enjoyable",

Enjoy your summer! The transition to college is extremely mentally challenging, and it really fucked me over mentally and prevented me from joining extracurriculars, barely eating, getting \u201cA\u201ds, etc. Have fun in your truly last summer, as future summers may entail internships or side hustles for your career! I\u2019m sure a restful break will mentally prepare you for your transition to college! Like other commenters, I also suggest skipping CS 1110 if you can. You can take a cooler CS class in its place!",

Anyways, this still isn\u2019t contradictory to what I said about enjoying your summer. You shouldn\u2019t spend your whole summer studying for a CASE exam. That is OVERKILL. PLEASE ENJOY YOUR SUMMER. You can probably spend an hour or less a day or something if you want to have a healthy exam study schedule to pass the CASE, but your whole summer shouldn\u2019t be focused on Cornell stuff. If you got a 5 in CSP I\u2019m sure passing the case will be no problem with some studying, but not an overkill amount of studying.",

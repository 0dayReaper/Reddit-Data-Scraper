Maybe try reaching out to the art department and see what they say.\n\nI wonder what the university did with all equipment that was in the woodshop in the basement of Riley Robb.",

What a shame those classes were discontinued.  the current selection is weak, and they weirdly are pushing \"active learning\" for classes that should be lectures.  \n\nThere's a shop in the architecture school on the ground floor of the Arch library across from \"the forge\" which has woodworking equipment.  It may have been moved there.",

It's possible that some of the equipment was moved over from Riley Robb, but you don't just consolidate two wood shops' worth of stuff down into one shop!",

It was kind of weird, like she was doing some great deed.  They are renovating the old building by taking out lovely oak wood work and cabinets and replacing them with plastic laminate midrange modern office style.  So basically they take out things that are strong, beautiful, full of soul/history and which have held up and lasted for 100 years and replacing them with things that will be broken and worn in 7 years.  \n\nSo, if the woodworking tools are not rotting in the room they were originally in, it has been sold.",

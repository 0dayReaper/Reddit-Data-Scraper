            "comment": "That\u2019s actually fucking unreal. Put yourself in my shoes, you\u2019re up working at this ungodly hour (currently 3:02 am) working on homework / playing chess / working on the third chapter of your short story exploring absurdism (how ironic). You\u2019re hungry asf. You take like 15 paces north down to the kitchen, go into the pantry, looking for any form of sustenance like the hungry little bitch you are, and find yourself face to face with this ridiculous object. \n\nThe things this can has lived through. I was in what like 5th grade when we presumably acquired it. Basically been there my entire cognizant life. So many memories and experiences, highs and lows, and all the while this can has in some small way remained a steadfast component of my life. In some ways, it\u2019s a part of me. It\u2019s always been there. \n\nI find this quite powerful. These sweet succulent pineapple innards have gone completely ignored for damn near a decade now. Just as we often ignore or take for granted the blessings which have been bestowed upon us. It\u2019s easy to get used to things, to think they\u2019re always be there, but before you know it they\u2019re 8 years expired and it\u2019s time to move on. And you never even realized how much it meant to you to have that in your life. I think this is fundamental component of what it is to be human, how else could this feeling be so universal? \n\nI suppose the takeaway message from this is : take an impartial look at your life, acknowledge the big ass cans of pineapple juice in your life, and appreciate and make the most of them before they expire",

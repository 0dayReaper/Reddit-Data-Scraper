    "postText": "Q abt internal hiring: applied for a position in another dept in early May and haven\u2019t heard back. I wonder abt reaching out to Hiring Manager as I have received rejection letters from other departments I have to job postings for.\nWhat is a good way to navigate, if to actually reach out at all? I\u2019m very curious about and interested in this position.",

I wonder some of the posting is the dept going through the motions of selection when a specific person is already in mind for hiring but I figure this would be less likely for a lower-level position",

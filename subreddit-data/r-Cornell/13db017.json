            "comment": "I haven\u2019t been to more than half the lectures but the content has followed the textbook almost exactly (Ch. 1-4, 6). I\u2019d strongly encourage you to bunker down and just read the book at a decent pace over the next couple days. Also jot down some notes on like a notecard or something to understand why some of the stated portfolio strategies successfuly replicate a derivative/contract. It became so much clearer for me, especially in chapter 6, when I\u2019d write quick notes like \u201cat time 1, bought N-expiring zero-coupon bond, have -X dollars. At time 2, shorted contract, have -X + Y dollars\u2026at time N, receive $1 from bond, owe money on the contract, left with Z dollars\u201d.\n\nAlso pay attention to the details. Understand when theorems and results apply and why you\u2019re able to generalize. This was important in chapter 2 with the martingale property, where first it\u2019s proven for discounted stock prices, then to derivatives, and then I believe to any discounted asset price in a binomial model with the risk-neutral measure.\n\nBtw it\u2019s open note and open book. Mark up your homework with mistakes and feedback and bring to the final. Do the same with the practice material that\u2019s been posted. Also both TA\u2019s are super willing to help and very responsive over email. I know at least 1 of them is holding office hours tomorrow. I can also help and explain things in layman\u2019s terms.",

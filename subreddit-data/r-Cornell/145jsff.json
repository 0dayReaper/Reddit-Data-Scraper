    "postText": "#**TL;DR at the bottom in bold**\n\nHey y\u2019all. It\u2019s the summer and 2 weeks after graduation, so the sub is in a bit of a lull right now. Even so, I thought it was important for the mod team of r/Cornell to reach out regarding some of Reddit\u2019s pending changes. I'm a proud 3rd-party app and old.reddit.com user, but this will affect everyone.\n\nIf you missed all the buzz (and don\u2019t know what an API or a 3rd-party app is), here are helpful links to get you started, as well as a graphic that hopefully makes things clear. From mod u/0reoperson: Basically, Reddit is trying to get rid of third-party apps, which are essential for moderators, subreddits, and users like you.\n\nELI5: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/) \n\nGraphic: [link](https://i.imgur.com/egnPRlz.png) \n\nPost from r/Save3rdPartyApps (image alt text is in the pinned comment below this post): [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/) \n\nApollo App Dev\u2019s announcement and documentation of admin mischief: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) \n\nReddit\u2019s most recent announcement: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/) \n\nReddit CEO's AMA: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/) \n\nAdditionally, I stumbled across this post ([link](https://old.reddit.com/r/NeverHaveIEverShow/comments/1435sdb/important_never_have_i_ever_season_4_releases/)) from r/NeverHaveIEverShow that I think gets at the heart of the issues for smaller subs like ours. Some key quotes from mod u/clarkkentshair:\n\n&gt; So, a well-designed third-party app is a \"[force multipler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication)\" (please excuse the militaristic nature of the term) that helps make supportive online spaces for smaller communities possible. Reddit's proposed \"API\" change maybe won't directly cause the downfall of smaller subreddit communities, but the experience of those (moderators) that try to create and cultivate such spaces, and the redditors that want to participate in them, will be negatively affected... and this would contribute to declining interaction, lower sense of connectivity/belonging, and probably eventual abandonment and shut down. And, all this precludes that access to reddit for some, e.g. the subreddit community [/r/blind](https://old.reddit.com/r/blind) (which coincidentally is around the same exact size as [/r/NeverHaveIEverShow](https://old.reddit.com/r/NeverHaveIEverShow)) [will *literally* shut down](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/), because those that need third-party apps to be 'screen-readers' for accessibility will be cut-off; this is [unjust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_justice).\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; In the face of imbalanced and disproportionate power -- which is what Reddit (corporation) / \"Admins\" have over subreddit communities and moderators -- mass-mobilization and [collective action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action) is how change happens. Change and success is not guaranteed, but the more the better, and this is a necessary effort to defend our right to exist, thrive, and have control when those rights are threatened, and also importantly to stand up in solidarity with others even beyond our own self-interest, because we see and are committed to others around us. These are values from the *raison d'\u00eatre* of \"Never Have I Ever\", illustrated in the journeys and plotlines of multiple characters in the show, and also [a pillar in the legacy and banner for community organizing and collective strength for South Asian diaspora](https://twitter.com/ConMijente/status/1269313334609936392/photo/1):\n\n&gt; Four Levels of Solidarity\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. **Symbolic Solidarity:** Verbally expressing solidarity, putting out/signing onto statements, wearing symbols/logos of solidarity.\n&gt; 2. **Transactional Solidarity:** Often done between organizations/groups, an even exchange.\n&gt; 3. **Embodied Solidarity:** Individuals literally embodying and living their visions/beliefs in the world.\n&gt; 4. **Transformative Solidarity:** ***When masses of oppressed communities choose to forego something that would benefit them, and do not take it because it comes at the expense of other oppressed communities.***\n&gt; \n&gt; from [Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM)](https://www.drumnyc.org/)\n&gt; \n\n#**TL;DR - What is r/Cornell doing?**\n\nOn June 12th? Nothing, currently. The mod team is still unsure what we as a subreddit can or should do (and we would have polled you all a bit earlier to see how you felt about potentially going dark). But there are nearly 50,000 of us at the time of writing, and with the end of the academic year already behind us, new mods will be coming in soon. This affects all of us, so we had to say something.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to participate in the blackout yourself, you could do a few things:\n\n- At the very least, if you feel strongly about what\u2019s happening here, don\u2019t use Reddit at all from June 12th-13th. Don\u2019t use the official app, don\u2019t log in on your computer, don\u2019t view, comment, or post any content.\n- Using the links I\u2019ve provided, you can directly contact the admins to make your voice heard. I doubt they\u2019ll respond, but you can try it. Stranger things have happened.\n- If you have a parent/sibling/cousin/cushy internship at a media company, more coverage is needed for this issue. Probably a pipe dream, but I thought I\u2019d mention it.\n- Delete your account. This is drastic, but it\u2019s probably the most effective tactic when employed in large numbers. Simply put, we are Reddit\u2019s product. If we do not produce content or engage with other user-submitted content (which is the foundation of the site), they have nothing to sell. And since Reddit is gunning for an IPO in the next few months ([link 1](https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-aims-ipo-second-half-2023-information-2023-02-14/)) ([link 2](https://fortune.com/2023/06/06/reddit-layoffs-job-cuts-stalle-ipo/)), the almighty dollar is the only thing they will respond to.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much all I and the mods have to say. Feel free to ask questions or share your thoughts in the comments. If the subreddit overwhelmingly wants to participate, we can definitely reevaluate our current position. And of course, we\u2019ll take no action without finding out what you want first.\n\nFin.",

Despite promises, the current plan looks to kill many bots, especially those that are used the most!\n\n## **Did you know?**\n\nModerating a typical sub takes hours of volunteer work a day even using 3rd-party bots; Without them, it will be impossible.\n\nAnd if you don't like spam, don't worry loads of porn-bots, scammers &amp; creeps LOVE IT!\n\nIf mods can't detect mature content in 3rd-party apps &amp; tools, it'll be easier than ever for them to sneak into your favorite community.\n\nReddit's walled-garden approach means bad actors can hide any content they want from mods, simply by posting it in a mature space.\n\nLet's not mince words: this will make it easier for scammers &amp; child sexual abuse rings to hide their activity on Reddit.\n\n## **TL;DR: What's actually changing?**\n\nReddit is changing the terms of their API, which lets apps and bots read and interact with reddit.\n\nReddit is enforcing limits on how often apps can talk to reddit. They are charging a predatory amount for apps that go over the limit.\n\nRough math puts them at 10-20x the cost of similar services (eg. Imgur). Developers only have 30 days to pay up or shut down.\n\nThey are also removing NSFW content from the API. That seems nice, but it makes it much easier for scammers and creeps to hide their activities from SW community mods.\n\nIn protest, a collective of subreddits are staging a shutdown starting June 12 and continuing until more reasonable terms are offered.\n\n## **How can I help?**\n\nContact the admins. Stop browsing.\n\nDon't download the \"official\" app.\n\nGet on Twitter. Get on\u00a0[r/Save3rdPartyApps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/).\n\nBe loud. Reach out to the press.

Since not everything in an app is text, including all sorts of interactions, apps need to be built following industry standards to provide information and fictionally to screen readers.\n\nReddit\u2019s apps don\u2019t do this as well or consistently as they should. Lots of third-party apps are much better at it, including ones we all know and love. There are also niche apps that are built with blind people and screen readers in mind that are likely to be less interesting for other users.\n\n## What this means for college students\n\nWell , there are lots of blind college students, to begin with. Fewer than there should be, because of lack of accessibility in books, tests, and other materials. They come to Reddit for help.",

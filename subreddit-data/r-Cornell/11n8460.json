    "postText": "You were with another girl and a guy. You were trying to get help with a paper you wrote but the guy was being such a jerk about it.\n\nThe things he was saying to you were so nasty and mean that I could not believe it. Obviously you knew your paper needed work, that's why you were trying to get help. But nobody deserves to be put down like you were, no matter how rough your paper is. \n\nWho knows what you have going on in your life right now. Not every paper is going to be your best work and there's nothing wrong with that. I mean damn, even if you're the worst writer on the planet, that doesn't make you stupid and certainly doesn't mean you can't be successful and happy.\n\nI was very upset overhearing these things. I would have stepped in to say something but I have autism and sometimes struggle with knowing what is appropriate to do in certain situations. When I got home, I talked it over with my wife and decided to make this post hoping you see it.\n\nI would like to offer to help you with your paper. I am not the strongest writer,  but I'm certain that nothing could have hurt your progress more than the words of that jerk. I am glad your other friend was there to stick up for you as much as she could.\n\nAs an alumni, I am ashamed that that guy represents a part of Cornell, and said such mean things to you. You made it this far, you need to know that you deserve to be here and that you can do anything. \n\nFeel free to reach out for help with your paper, I'm sure there might be other folks on this sub that would be happy to help as well.",

However, it wasn\u2019t until I directed that unwarranted behavior towards my loved ones that I realized I had carried that hurt with me across the years and was continuing the cycle.\n\nTo the girl, I hope she realizes she\u2019s always deserving of dignity and respect. To the guy, I hope he realizes being \u201cright\u201d and in the know-how never justifies cruel criticism of others, regardless of how insignificant their questions might wrongly feel to him. \n\nThank you for offering to help the girl, it is posts like this one that make me proud of this community. We should always opt for compassion over disdain.",

It's really difficult to realize that not only have you been hurt that way, but that you're making those you care for feel the same way. But it's so important to feel that because then you can grow as a person and end that terrible cycle. I hope you're doing well and feeling better about that now. Thank you for the support!",

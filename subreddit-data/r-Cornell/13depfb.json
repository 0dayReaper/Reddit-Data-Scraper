The most common box we sell (28\"\\*18\"\\*18\") is $14 and that is double weight so it will last forever. Actually have had students use them for storage every year from Freshman to Senior year before. We have around a thousand boxes coming in this week so stop in, I doubt we will run out. We also have all the packing material and tape you'll need. Home Depot or Lowes boxes tear easily so it's a one use type of deal. I've moved thousands of boxes in my time at Marty's, come in and we will help you get what you need.",

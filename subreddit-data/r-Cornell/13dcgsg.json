The Ivy League awards the conference championship to the team with the best record at the conclusion of the regular season. If two or more teams are tied with the same record the championship is shared.\n\nThe team was undefeated and untied in league play during 17 of their 19 outright championships, the most of any Ivy team.\n\nSince the introduction of the Ivy League lacrosse tournament in 2010 Cornell has won the tournament twice, in 2011 and 2018.\n\nThe Big Red have appeared in the [NCAA lacrosse tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Lacrosse_Championship) 30 times.\"",

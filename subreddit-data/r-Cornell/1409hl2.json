I'm a high school student that is planning to move to Ithaca to finish my remaining 2 years of high school.\n\nI'm planning to take the Online summer course \"AEM 2841 Python for Non-Dyson Majors\" and would love some suggestions about what to study prior to the course (other than Python &amp; Excel), the overall difficulty of the course, or helpful tips from students who took the course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!",

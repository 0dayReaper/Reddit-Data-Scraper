    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm currently a rising senior in electrical engineering from Texas A&amp;M University and Cornell is one of the schools I'm looking at for graduate school (Being in college station has been extremely difficult for me with the lack of hiking and outdoorsy things to do). I wondered if anyone on this thread knew of bioelectronics professors to contact for information regarding this research area.\n\nI'm specifically interested in the electrochemistry/materials and experimental side (trying to get away from EE &amp; more into materials) and currently researching lignocellulose materials for supercapacitors (which is similar to the area I want to). I specifically want to go into renewable energy and use bioelectronics in energy production. I tried looking at the Cornell website and it looks like there are professors that do similar work (tissue and medical bioelectronics) but I'm having trouble finding professors in the specific area I'm interested in. \n\nIf anyone has any information, I would appreciate it! Thanks in advance!",

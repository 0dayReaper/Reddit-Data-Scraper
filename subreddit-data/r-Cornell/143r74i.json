No longer needed to bring notebooks and I had everything synced to the cloud. There were days where I would just bring my ipad instead of my computer. I had numerous assignments where I needed to scan a document, but I just downloaded the PDF or word doc and justed worked on it on the iPad. If I made an error, I just edited on the iPad.\n\n\n Also ipads are better to watch movies while in bed.\n\nI used the ipad pro because I wanted a 120 hertz display that the ipad air does not have. Well worth the investment for the quality of life improvement. \n\nIs it a necessity? Definitely not. You could live with just a laptop, but the quality of life improvement was well worth the investment. Especially when traveling, an ipad is way better than bringing a laptop.",

I know people said printing is annoying but to be perfectly honest it\u2019s an extra like 3 minutes of your life to print out the occasional practice exam. Personally really dislike taking notes on an iPad, I can\u2019t write quickly on them. Again some of this is personal, but what I can tell you is it\u2019s not going to help you at all with the coding and stuff, that\u2019s all on the laptop. Again, cannot see why you would spend whatever it is like 1000 dollars on an iPad when you already have to buy a laptop and then just get a 97 cent notebook and a pen. Personally, I would spend that extra thousand getting a rock solid laptop, good processor and memory, good display, whatever you like, because that\u2019s gonna be the thing that makes the most difference in your day to day as a CS major.\n\nEdit: also live in a house with 4 other CS majors and one CS MEng, and we all had a debate about this and all arrived at the same conclusion that the cost would never be worth it.",

I did first year without it and once I got one (I bought a used older gen off eBay for 400 or so) it changed the game. Of course it\u2019s not the same as writing on paper like you said, but you can get screen protectors that add more friction to make it more similar. You can most definitely do what you suggested and not have one and use pen and paper, but that can\u2019t beat having access to everything you need for all your homework all in the same place whenever you want it.",

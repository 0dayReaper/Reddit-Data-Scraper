She knew her death would be political (\u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,\" she reportedly told her granddaughter). You don't get to be a SCJ by \"keeping politics out of it.\"\n\nIf you're grieving, PLEASE use this as an opportunity to take action. It's not just about getting Trump out of office: volunteer as a poll worker, fight voter suppression, advocate for redistricting reform. Democracy shouldn't rest on the shoulders of one single woman. Taking steps to make this country a more democratic, equitable place, will honor her memory more than any statue.\n\n[https://swingleft.org/](https://swingleft.org/)\n\n[https://tcdemocrats.org/mec-events/new-york-for-bidenharris-tompkins-county-for-biden-swing-state-phone-bank-virtual/?fbclid=IwAR3DDhfQjcO54pAuL0Fi\\_aRBXhsdmn0W-f3cQB6vLqEd2tCDGxLVXgLYZcE](https://tcdemocrats.org/mec-events/new-york-for-bidenharris-tompkins-county-for-biden-swing-state-phone-bank-virtual/?fbclid=IwAR3DDhfQjcO54pAuL0Fi_aRBXhsdmn0W-f3cQB6vLqEd2tCDGxLVXgLYZcE)\n\n[https://powerthepolls.com/fairfight](https://powerthepolls.com/fairfight)\n\n[https://indivisible.org/resource/fighting-gerrymandering-states#](https://indivisible.org/resource/fighting-gerrymandering-states#)\n\n[https://joebiden.com/take-action/](https://joebiden.com/take-action/)\n\nor at the very least, register to vote:\n\n[https://turbovote.org/](https://turbovote.org/)",

I can't figure out where it's from so I was just wondering if Cornell sent it to graduating seniors or something..? I was low-key worried that maybe it was supposed to have my diploma, but those are supposed to be mailed late June, so I don't think it's that. Just curious if anyone else got the same thing lol\n\nEdit: mystery solved, it was the frame for a grad gift from my relative that arrived later lmao",

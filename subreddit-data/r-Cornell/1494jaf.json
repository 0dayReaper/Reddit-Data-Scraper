    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming exchange student (undergrad) from London and I've been assigned a single in the above. Can't find any detailed information or even pictures on what the dorm will be like! Other than that it's a Gothic. I'm slightly nervous because I haven't lived in student accommodation at my uni either.\n\nAny information on social life/facilities/bathroom situation/advice/anything I should know? What are the rooms/layout like? Have I been assigned to a good/average/bad room? What kind of electric sockets are in the room? Is it far from the main campus? What's the food in their dining hall like? How many people will I be sharing a bathroom with and will it be mixed gender? How many people are the kitchens shared with?\n\nLiterally any information would be great lol. If anyone is willing to share pics (even of the outside of South Baker Hall?) I'd be super grateful!\n\nAlso feel free to give any general advice about Cornell! Thanks in advance :)",

            "comment": "I lived in lyon in my second year (another rose gothic that is all female). Rose dining is great! and west campus has 5 smaller dining halls to choose from every night all serving different meals (the dining on west is the best on all of campus). West campus is probably the most convenient to classes (except you have to walk up the slope every day, but other than that, it\u2019s very close).\n\nI haven\u2019t been in baker, but a rose gothic is typically an older room with no elevator, but bathrooms shared by roughly 10 people and a community kitchen shared by the dorm (maybe 70-100 people). The rooms are not too big, enough room for a bed, desk, dresser, closet, and some floor space. The gothics are very beautiful and have wonderful old windows, but can get pretty hot in the summer (but for the most part ithaca isnt too hot so you should be ok). Not completely sure about the bathroom logistics for baker, it might be mixed or single gender (I know some dorms have gendered floors). Also you have access to all the dorms within rose house (5 different buildings) so you have access to 5 different kitchens, 2 laundry rooms, a bunch of different common areas, etc.)\n\nI think you lucked out, a single on west is a great housing arrangement!",

The dorm rooms (and towers) are excellent. They are a great place to have fun, throw parties, and clap cheeks. Yup, some of the greatest memories were formed, especially clapping cheeks at the top of rose towers!",

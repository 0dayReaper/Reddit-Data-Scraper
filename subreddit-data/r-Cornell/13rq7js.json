    "postText": "I recently switched my major to PAM because the curriculum is more engaging and interesting to me and I feel like I have a natural affinity in those courses(unless they are actually easy and I'm fooling myself). I'm trying to make as much bank as I can for someone not perusing law school, med school, or a tech degree and I was wondering if anyone had ideas about how to make the most from a PAM degree. I'm picking up a minor in data science but if there are any classes or certifications that would help make me a more valuable candidate(aka make me more money and get me job offers) I'd love any advice. Also, in general, are job prospects good for PAM majors? I hear people graduating either have a great job lined up or none.",

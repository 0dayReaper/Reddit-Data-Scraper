            "comment": "lived in a double there. not extraordinary and not awful. i found the doubles (at least mine) to be a little cramped and dark, but not undoable. lots of lounge space and the location is great, but the biggest downside for me was that its far from dining halls (closest is oakenshields, which is closed on weekends), so if you mostly rely on dining halls rn then you have to be okay with trekking down to west or oakies, or just tackle cooking for yourself instead - that\u2019s what i did and it\u2019s so much cheaper than a dining plan anyways. But the easy walk to classes and the convenience of being in ctown made up for its shortcomings for me.",

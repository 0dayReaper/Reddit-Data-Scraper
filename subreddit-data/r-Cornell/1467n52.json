If you like to learn in your free time and some of the topics happen to be stuff covered in Algo, obviously, there's nothing wrong learning it now.\n\nBut I promise you're not doing yourself any favors by studying for the class before you take it. Just take the class when you take it.",

Consequently, the residents of HD 37124 B aren\u2019t particularly keen to celebrate their home\u2019s brisk 154.4-day orbit. IB-702 is one of those residents. Has been for as long as he can remember, and indeed, as the new year beckons, he\u2019s given the event minimal thought. IB-702 is not unique in this sentiment, in fact, he is unique only in name.\n\nSince Cornell University annexed the Jovian HD 37124 system 4000 Earth-years ago in the great Ivy conquest of 641402, the economy of the HD 37124 system has been dominated by the extraction of the volatile gases which make up the systems 3 planetary bodies. Over the millennia, gases on HD 37124 A and B have been extracted significantly enough to allow for the development of permanent colonies with C remaining largely untouched, barring the occasional research team or topographical expedition. While HD 37124 A serves as the home of the Cornell funded research labs and residential development for the colonies some 500 million inhabitants, HD 37124 B has serves as the financial hub of the colony. \u00a0\n\n\u2026\n\nEssentially a bildungsroman where our protagonist IB-702 (short for investment banker as is detailed in further world building) develops into a distinct individual after being raised in a colonial society where one's occupation is literally all that there is to them. Ultimately I want this to detail my personal philosophy by incorporating elements of absurdism, existentialism, stuff along those lines. This is much more a work of catharsis than any kind of literary masterpiece.",

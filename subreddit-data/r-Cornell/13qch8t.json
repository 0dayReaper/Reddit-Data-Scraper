It's already a majorly censored platform then becomes a main hub for local online conversation and like you say a few \"freaks\" take over mod and control the conversation. \n\nIt's really no good for anyone.",

            "comment": "Many people here moved to Sidechat, so r/Cornell has become more of a Q&amp;A platform than anything. While Sidechat has a mix of funny and unfunny content like this subreddit, there\u2019s a huge distinction between Sidechat content and r/Cornell content. You\u2019ll likely get flagged by users for posting an r/Cornell-like question (ie something about grades, assignments, etc) and there are way less admissions questions because you need a netID to be on Sidechat. This incentivizes more entertaining posts, and there are more active people there than on Reddit, so you\u2019ll get better, less redundant posts on Sidechat. The academic side to r/Cornell and the vast information it has on courses, financial aid, and other topics on Cornell that you can\u2019t look up on Sidechat is the reason why I\u2019m still here. Also so many users who used to frequently post have either left or graduated, and nowadays you won\u2019t get as much traction on your posts/comments as you got a year ago.",

What was is like making friends, after coming in a year late? What\u2019s it like going from a quarter system to a semester system?",

It is a little awkward at the beginning of the semester when a lot your classmates already know each other, but there are so many transfers in the same boat that you won\u2019t feel too out of place or left out.\n\nI transferred here from a quarter school and I get really bored with my classes by the end of the semester because it\u2019s so long. But otherwise quarters to semesters is an easy switch.",

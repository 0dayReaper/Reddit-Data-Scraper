            "comment": "Hey there! I totally feel you- I graduated last year and when the post grad depression hit, it pretty much trapped me in my house for a period of 3 months. I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone, couldn\u2019t get out of the house, barely took care of myself at all. It was a variety of things: I didn\u2019t have the best college experience unfortunately (right when I was finding my footing, COVID hit, and I couldn\u2019t come back to campus till senior year bc of financial stuff and finaid entirely not paying me anything Junior year) and the job career services hooked me up with was actually not the job I signed up for\u2026 at all. I signed up to do cancer research and was promised that by my interviewers, the people at the org\u2026 when I got the official job description it turned out I was gonna be a secretary instead and the location turned out to be super unsafe so I had to leave as quickly as I\u2019d joined. So here I sat at home, feeling like the last four years were for naught in so many ways. And at night I kept having nightmares of my disillusionment especially with my major\u2019s and minor\u2019s departments (I don\u2019t wanna talk about it but on my other Reddit I think I published 5-6 posts about the horrors I went through with profs). I felt like a failure and just was broken. \n\nWhen I was recovering from that, I got rejected from all my grad school apps and another period of depression hit, knowing I\u2019d have to wait another year of my life to pursue my dream. Post grad depression is very real especially bc when you go home, the safety net of a social environment is gone. Suddenly you\u2019re free falling with no parachute and the fear turns into sadness when you\u2019re lonely. \n\nAnd dws, I\u2019m mostly okay now. Trying to figure some stuff out but I can finally say I\u2019ve mostly recovered.",

    "postText": "Hi, new international student here! Would love to hear how much time appx. did it take you to go through customs in NY airports (JFK or Newark) and getting to the bus terminal in NYU. I have appx. 4 hours between my arrival (4pm) and last bus going to Ithaca (8pm) and I'm worried I might not make it. Would love to hear anyone's opinion!",

            "comment": "In my experience as a fellow international student, Newark is way better but it's also farther from downtown. 4h should hopefully be enough, but it's extremely variable. Some advice based on my experience on how to get to Port Authority Bus Terminal (PA) or to George Washington Bridge Bus Station (GWB):\n\n* If landing in **Newark**, take the **AirTrain and NJ Transit to Penn Station**, then move through NYC with the subway. Don't bother with the \"express buses\", they are a scam and actually take longer.\n   * If your bus is from **PA**, you can walk from Penn Station very easily (it's six blocks north, less than **10min walk**). So no need to take the subway.\n   * If your bus is from **GWB**, take an **A train to 175 St** or a **1 train to 181 St** (this should take \\~30min and there are trains every 10min).\n* If landing in **JFK**, take the **AirTrain to Jamaica**, and then:\n   * If your bus is from **PA**, you can either:\n      * Take a **LIRR** (Long Island Rail Road) train to **Penn Station**. This is more expensive (about **$20**) but will get you there faster.\n      * Take an **E train** **to PA**. Only do this if you have time to spare. It is cheaper (about **$10**) but takes longer.\n   * If your bus is from **GWB**, honestly it's far enough to justify always taking **LIRR to Penn Station** and then an **A train to 175 St** or a **1 train to 181 St**.\n\nGreat website with even more options: [https://new.mta.info/guides/airports](https://new.mta.info/guides/airports)",

If you book a trip with Ourbus, then you are eligible for transferring the amount paid to the wallet provided that you request at least 30 minutes before scheduled departure time.",

The bigger question is - EWR or JFK. Depending on weekday vs weekend, you might get screwed getting to the bus from Newark.\n\nYou could take the train from Newark to Penn and then Uber/taxi to the bus but that can get hectic.",

Idk if you\u2019re taking a flight that goes through one of USA\u2019s overseas customs (Abu Dhabi, Ireland, and a few other airports have US customs facilities. if you go through them, then you arrive in the US at the domestic terminal and do not go through customs) but if you\u2019re not, customs take around 15-30 minutes on a good day (early morning or really late night flights) longest they\u2019ve taken for me was around an hour, flight arrived with 2 other international ones",

            "comment": "The longest wait I've had to get out of JFK was 5 hours. Flight left on time, landed on time. It was August so weather was not an issue. \n\nWe had to wait an hour just to get a gate. We were allowed to disembark, only to be held up at the air bridge for an hour+. They let US citizens through since they use the kiosks whereas anyone who was international had to wait until there was space. They eventually allow Canadians and ESTA visa holders to use the US citizen lanes. When you get down to immigration it was packed like sardines. Airport employees were there to make announcements and keep lines orderly but everything is dependent on how fast immigration officers can process people. By the time we finished immigration, our luggage were off to the side, not in the baggage carousel. \n\nMy experience is going to be the extreme; but depending on how long your flight from abroad is (mine was 15+ hours), would you still have the headspace to deal with anything if something goes wrong? Or just book a cheap room nearby and take the bus the next day?",

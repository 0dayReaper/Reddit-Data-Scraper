    "postText": "I know many professors have taken advantage of COVID to be shitty to students, but the same applies to students and professors. The amount of guilt-tripping and complaints over every little inconvenience is so embarrassing. Right now i'm specifically referring to the student who wrote an essay in the VIEN1104 EdStem about how unfair it was that they could not go back on their quiz and that they were \"denied the right to submit answers they were confident in\" despite their being a 60-minute time limit for an open-book 20 question multiple choice quiz (literally the answers were word for word from the lecture). The teachers in this class are sooo fucking nice and there's literally 10% extra credit (yes, you can get a 110% in VIEN1104 and the class is already straightforward). Students already complained about ATTENDING LECTURE so they doubled attendance points and reduced the # of lectures. I cringe the way some of you talk to TAs and Professors in office hours and interrupt class because you think a stressful semester excuses any individual accountability. You are not owed a free A this semester because of COVID. Shoutout to my one professor who responded to a student who interrupted saying \"i forgot about the quiz this week,  we need more announcements about module quizzes\" with \"I am not your mother\". There's complaints relating to student's general lack of organization and preparation that they're now putting on professors and blaming on the burden of COVID, in situations that there is no reason to do so. The way you complain would make it seem as if you are in the hospital awaiting a lung transplant for your COVID diagnosis. OBVIOUSLY there needs to be some level of understanding about accommodating increased stress, but this doesn't mean we just obliterate the standards that exist in any normal semester. Shut the fuck up, get a planner, and do your work, thank you!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit sry bout my grammar yeet ",

You are not funny and your interruption are so fking annoying. Shut the fuck up and stop just unmuting yourself at your wish to say garbage like this and expecting people to laugh. I genuinely don\u2019t think people will just stand up in an auditorium with hundreds of people and say stuff like this in a normal semester. But zoom obviously emboldened them. God I wish I can mute someone.",

Plus they might do bullshits like reporting you of hurting their feelings and making them experiencing autism and then you get into troubles. I personally think the best way is just to ignore these morons.",

You are just literally skimming through 30% of the lectures at 2x speed, never even downloaded the textbook or notes, and wonder why you struggle. Gee, idk, I guess it's cuz the TA graded your papers wrong.",

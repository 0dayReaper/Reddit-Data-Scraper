    "postText": "I've got an ACER XB241H monitor I don't really use. 1920x1080, 144 Hz, 24\", G-Sync compatible. It's got the original stand, but is VESA compatible if you wanna throw it on a regular monitor arm.\n\nI can also throw in whatever cables you might want, I've got 2 meter HDMI-HDMI, 1m Displayport to USB-C, and 1m Displayport to Displayport. Take one or take 'em all, I have zero use for them.\n\nLooking for... $80! I'm in Ithaca for the summer, so I can hand it off anytime, anywhere near or on campus.\n\nEdit: sold!",

One intended for engineers/physics/CS (19xx and 29xx math courses) and one for those interested in more theoretical/proof-based math (11xx and 22xx math courses). The engineering sequence is designed to teach engineers all of the math they need for their other classes in time and teaches multi/linear algebra in a way such that you don't need linear algebra for multi. It's the opposite in the other sequence. You can read more about the different tracks here. [https://math.cornell.edu/enrollment-new-students](https://math.cornell.edu/enrollment-new-students)",

If you're a math major you really need that.",

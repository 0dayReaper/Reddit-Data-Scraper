    "postText": "So, I've been dying the last few days and it turns out it's because I have Mono (diagnosed just td). Unfortunately, my finals are monday and thursday of this upcoming week. My doctor recommended talking to my professors about special circumstances for my tests. However, I leave for home on thursday after my final. Some good news is that just today, I've begun to feel a little better. A part of me feels like I could be well enough to take my tests monday and thursday, and the other part of me thinks it might be in my best interest to contact my professor and see about what can be done. I guess my only worry with the latter is that if I reach out to my professor explaining my situation they might not let me take the test monday at all. Has anyone been in a situation like this and can explain what the usual policy is for finals given the circumstances? I've heard that you can be offered an incomplete for the class and then the oppertunity to take the final the next semester. Is this still true or is it just for COVID? Thanks!",

You\u2019re also gonna be super tired for the next few weeks and I\u2019m sure your doctor told you to absolutely avoid exercise for the next few weeks so your spleen doesn\u2019t rupture. Unfortunately walking to class at Cornell qualifies as exercise given the distance and hills. \n\nI\u2019m sure Cornell will offer you testing alternatives and professors (for the most part) are understanding of medical emergencies. If they\u2019re not, go complain about it.",

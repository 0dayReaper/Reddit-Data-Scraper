    "postText": "Apologies to the mods if this is spam, but I have posted about this in the past.\n\nLast year we had our first in-person Game Design Showcase since COVID. It was a resounding success, and we had record turnout despite it being near the end of finals. I would like to beat that this year, so I am getting the word out.  \n\nThe showcase will be held 1-4pm in the Physical Sciences Building this Saturday (May 20th). It will consist of 12 PC games and 9 mobile game. More information can be found here:\n\n[https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/gdiac/showcase/](https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/gdiac/showcase/)\n\nI know a lot of people have left campus already. But it would mean a lot to the students if we had good turn out. Please join us if you are able.",

Yes, grades are on a curve but nothing could have prepared you for entirely changing the way you live your life and the way you learn (maybe I'm leaning into this too much-i don't have kids in your shoes yet but my friends who do have shared some of the hardships).\n\nNo-you're job prospects are not gone. Yes, you make have to take a unique career path to get where you'd like to go someday. But, you have time. A lot of time. Don't rush it. Look for fun jobs, unique opportunities, things you are interested in but might not pay a ton (teaching? Government jobs? Startups?)...these things may lead you down a path you end up loving. \n\nMost of all...give yourself some grace here and just keep trying. Keep applying, keep searching, email that random alumni, reach out to that friend of a friend or parent for advice, do everything. Do not sit around and be upset about things that have already happened-find a way to spin it in an interview and you'll be all right.\n\nSource: had a few grades I'm not proud of, did all of the above...looking back the hustle was fun...and it makes for a hell of an interview conversation when you explain the path you've been on to get to that next role.",

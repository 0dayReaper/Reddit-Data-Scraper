            "comment": "Essentially Math 3210 is foundational for the topic that Math 4540 introduces, but not a prerequisite because 4540 simplifies it in such a way as to avoid having to deal with much of the intricacies. Here\u2019s what mean: \n\nMath 3210 concerns the topic of differential topology, which is the study of calculus on n-dimensional surfaces that are invariant under smooth transformations. You\u2019re going to be using the concept that everything locally looks like Euclidean space, along with the machinery of tangent vectors and differential forms to define differentiation and integration. At this point you have no notion of length or angle, keep this in mind. \n\nNow, if I want to measure lengths and angles, that\u2019s the subject of Math 4540. Differential geometry. To do this you\u2019ll need to introduce a Riemannian metric and Levi civita connection on your aforementioned smooth n-dimensional surfaces, which you can think as generalizations of the inner product and a method to comparing \u201cvectors in different tangent vector spaces\u201d.\n\nNow the reason it\u2019s not a strict prerequisite, is that Math 4540 does not start at the n-dimensional generalization right away, OR they assume the differential topology. Depends on the profs. As in, you could be working with curves and surfaces embedded in R^2 and R^3, looking at things like Gauss-Bonett theorem, second fundamental form, etc. To understand the differential geometry of n-dimensions you\u2019ll need the full understanding of Math 3210 (and a lot more) but for now, the contents are related but largely different.",

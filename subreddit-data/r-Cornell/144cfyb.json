    "postText": "Edit: I'm sorry I could not respond since my comments have been shadowbanned. To address some of the issues, first I believe that r/Cornell, like many other places on Reddit, can be helpful and life-saving at times. So, it's entirely possible for these subreddits to be someone's best thing that has happened to them. But you don't just leave your house once there's something wrong with it. And for many, they can't just leave Reddit because it's a safe space for them too. \n\nEdit 2: On another note, I guess the subreddit itself doesn't seem to be enthusiastic about the protest. On a personal level, you can join it by leaving the app on June 12th-14th EST, or alternatively, if you can (and are willing to) you can also leave the app indefinitely til they resolved the pricing issues.\n\nInformation about the blackout protest [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1).\n\nIn short, Reddit is changing its pricing for API usage, and the majority of community auto-moderation tools and third-party apps will become unusable because of its ridiculously high prices. This is going to affect us in so many ways. For one, the ability to moderate spam and bots will be seriously compromised. Moreover, the lack of accessibility is a huge concern. For example, the official Reddit app completely overlooks visually impaired or blind folks, so these folks have to rely on third-party apps to use Reddit. \n\nJoining in this protest, we can make our voices heard and hopefully prevent Reddit from turning into a worse version of itself (looking at you Twitter).",

If everyone and their mom (literally) are looking for storage boxes, you won't find any just being handed out. A couple days ago Big Red Shipping was doing a promo where if you reposted their post on your Instagram story you could get a couple boxes for free, but that's all there's been of free boxes to my knowledge.",

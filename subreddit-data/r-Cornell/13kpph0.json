From there you can take a subway again or LIRR to Jamaica station. Then an airtrain there will get you to JFK. \n\nFeel free to DM if you have questions about any of this \\^.",

It\u2019s a matter of convenience, is way cheaper than an Uber or taxi ride between the two places, and you don\u2019t have to deal with the immense stopping that comes with taking the subway.\n\nLIRR is almost always recommended by Google Maps as the quickest route to get from Penn Station (and even any other A train station north of Penn) to JFK. \n\nFor someone who\u2019s always telling others to Google things, why don\u2019t you try doing that yourself next time?",

    "postText": "I went to my extended family's house for christmas and one of them just tested positive after going to the ER. I feel completely fine but for sanity's sake just wanted to get tested. It took me three hours, no joke, three hours to book a testing appointment. I have to drive 45 minutes away and leave at 7:30 in the morning just to get a covid test within the next three days. All the nearby testing slots are either full or don't accept my insurance.\n\nI miss just being able to walk down to Willard Straight every 3 days and be able to get a covid test in like 5 minutes. I miss that constant reassurance that yea, I'm covid-free. Cornell, I don't know how the hell you were able to get so many students tested constantly, but thank you so much. Having to wait two days is gonna kill me, but it's also made me appreciative of Cornell. So yea, good job Cornell!",

Someone in my family had to get tested due to potential workplace exposure, and it was a complete mess, even though I live down the street from the headquarters of the largest hospital and medical system in my region. Cornell and Cayuga Medical Center really did an astounding job with this.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshmen majoring in HBHS in College of Human Ecology with the original intention of pursuing the Pre-Med route. However, I recently realized that I might be interested in an alternate career possibly in Data Science/Quant/Finance and was wondering what would be the most recommended internal transfer option for me, hopefully a smooth transition after my first year.",

Cals and stats both have minimal requirements and I even internally transfered junior year to it. If you can though I think a cs + math/stats major fits those interests well.",

But if you want it the info is in the article above. It was kind of shocking for me cause I met the guy ages ago in my first year orientation group, hadn\u2019t talked to him since but yeah I was definitely unpleasantly surprised.",

Also, while I don\u2019t fully understand the legal stuff, my understanding is the guy is saying he is \u201calso a complainant\u201d as in the person accusing him is a complainant as well. Basically that just means he is legally resisting the allegations and filed a countersuit (I think). Admittedly his wording is kind of hard to understand cause \u201ccomplaint of a title IX violation\u201d could mean he is also alleging some kind of discrimination, harassment, or assault, or that he is fighting against the claim that he performed a violation, the second would make much more sense to me.",

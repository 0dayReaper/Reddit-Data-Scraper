    "postText": "As I wallow away on hour 10 of my CS2802 final, a class along with it's -2 variant for whom prelims make perhaps the most sense in the department. Yet despite this class being my favorite, most challenging and rewarding class I've ever taken,  whose exams still make me plain sad, I'm sat wondering about how the hell this backwards ass system came to be. Let alone in the department, just in general, weighting like half a poor soul's grade for a 15 week class on a few hours is so ridiculously counter-intuitive. Particularly in CS.   \n\n\nMan, the things I'd do to have assignments and projects be like 15% harder to and weighed significantly more so prelims weren't such a big deal. You know, correlate how accurate one's knowledge and by extension grade for a subject is with how much time was dedicated to it. Now that's crazy talk!  \n\n\nSigned, resident prelim-hater",

The problem that I always hear come up when this is discussed is what to do about the fact that a significant portion of students will cheat on take-home work.  If you have solutions I'm sure a lot of people would love to hear it.",

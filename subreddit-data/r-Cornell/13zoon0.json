People thinking that every time they feel anxious is somehow indicative of a mental illness both pathologizes normal emotions and subverts the needs and experience of people who actually have anxiety as an ongoing health condition.",

Anxiety disorder is characterized as consistent anxiety that interferes with your day to day activities. If you don\u2019t know if you have an anxiety disorder, please consult a trained mental health expert :)",

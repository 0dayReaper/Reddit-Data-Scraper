Was it doable? Compared to first-year admissions, is the selection process nearly as grueling or is it p chill?\n\nAny input would be appreciated (\":",

It might vary with your essay writing skills, but I banged out my essay the same day I applied, without having met with any advisors, and I got in. The standards to apply aren't terribly difficult to meet and the essay component is a pretty standard \"Why transfer and why A&amp;S?\" \n\nIt definitely didn't feel to me as grueling as the undergrad admissions process. You can also reapply if you get rejected. If you're still considering or have more questions you can find professionals you can consult with, which I'd recommend (although I never did it myself, lol). I'd say if you have a strong essay, you'll likely be fine.",

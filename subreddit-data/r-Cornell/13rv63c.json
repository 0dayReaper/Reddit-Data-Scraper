    "postText": "I'm a humanities major who took 4780 last semester and really enjoyed it! Curious if anyone has recommendations for similar classes to take after, and what kind of mathematical background is needed for classes like 4789 and 4783? I took 4780 without any math prereqs (literally hadn't taken calc 1 before; studied entrance exam over winter break), so I'm really worried about not being able to keep up in the follow-up classes, but I also really want to keep learning about the subject. Does doing decent in 4780 prepare you enough for future classes?",

            "comment": "Sheesh my question is how the hell you did good + enjoyed 4780 without much math background. It's typically considered a more mathy class that you need to prep for, so props to you\n\nIf you were able to really follow the theory in the notes and all the proofs then you seem pretty ready for advanced ml to me. If you want you can (and probably should) refresh on important linear algebra, probability, and statistics.",

With no calculus background he could do well and enjoy 4780?",

I did really enjoy the theory and spent a lot of time trying to understand all the proofs in lecture so that's really good to hear! In that case might try some of the later classes just to check them out (if they open during add drop), and will definitely keep studying those topics over summer. Thanks!",

Not sure how you managed to self study calc 1,2, and bits of multi + linear algebra up to Hessians in one winter break but ig it worked out for you. NLP probably has the most similar math problems to 4780 (some simple backprop, n-gram probability, etc). CV has much more linear algebra and the math is almost completely not ML related. Reinforcement learning is a ton of pretty hard calc and linear algebra based proofs that are definitely above the level of 4780.",

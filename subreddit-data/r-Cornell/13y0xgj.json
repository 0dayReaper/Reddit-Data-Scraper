    "postText": "Hello! Hope everyone is well. \n\nI am a member of the Class of 2027, I was wondering if it was possible for pre-frosh to switch majors prior to arriving on campus? I am hoping to transfer from Communications in CALS to English in A&amp;S. I've been looking around online but unfortunately the information is a bit confusing, and I could use some help. \n\nThank you for reading!",

            "comment": "You have to wait two semesters since new policy dictates first sem frosh cannot apply for internal transfer. The earliest you can join A&amp;S as English is sophomore fall, but the process to transfer is pretty straightforward &amp; as long as you have a passable GPA (think: 3.0+) you should be able to successfully move. All you need to do now is make sure you take classes that contribute to the A&amp;S English major while remaining in good standing with CALS.",

They have policies in place that make it not possible, particularly because someone will obviously try to get into an \u201ceasier\u201d school like ILR and switch to what they really want to do.",

OP isn\u2019t asking if an internal transfer is ever possible, they\u2019re asking if they can get an internal transfer before they\u2019ve even attended a class in the school, which is not allowed. There are kids who would kill for their spot, and to just switch into another school right after getting accepted is gaming the system even if that\u2019s not the intention.",

You will have to apply for an internal transfer after completing some requisite coursework for your intended new major while remaining in good standing with your home college CALS. The earliest this is possible is after your first semester, though it depends on when you can get the transfer reqs done.",

I do not think we will know for certain which orgs will COB until the fall.\n\nI believe AOPi is also planning to recolonize at Cornell in the coming year, after a 15-year absence, though I do not have any details.",

The sad thing is that because the way Panhel rush works and the small number of sororities they don\u2019t get to develop their own culture like fraternities do. Effectively the only difference between sororities is social status, which isn\u2019t good for longevity of greek life.",

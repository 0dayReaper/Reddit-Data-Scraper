    "postText": "My baby goes to daycare here. My mom lives here and is fighting breast cancer. My partner works in an essential job and has had to report to work in person throughout the pandemic.\n\nThis sucks and it was handled poorly and I feel so hard for everyone trying to make astronomically expensive plans at the last minute. I wouldn't be able to handle the financial or the logistical challenge. I've already opted for an online semester, because I anticipate having to be both a stay-at-home mom and full time student all over again when things go south.\n\nIf you come, please be chill, be careful, quarantine, wear a mask, and don't party?\n\nAlso if I can help you out in any way with information or advice about Cornell or Ithaca, please don't hesitate to message me.",

I realize that \"staff\" is huge and amorphous, but there's such a big gap between students/faculty and staff, and I wish I understood how we could support each other better...because this whole planning process has been ridiculous and inhumane.",

It was built around the same time and in the same style as the Low Rises, so I'm assuming the numbering system is the same.\n\n8 = Low Rise 8, which is what the HILC was originally called\n\n1 = no idea what this stands for, my room # also started with it\n\n2 = floor number\n\n3 = suite number\n\n4 = specific room number\n\nSo, it seems like you'll be living in the HILC's second floor in Suite 3's 4th room. Hope this helps!",

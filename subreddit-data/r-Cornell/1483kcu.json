It was built around the same time and in the same style as the Low Rises, so I'm assuming the numbering system is the same.\n\n8 = Low Rise 8, which is what the HILC was originally called\n\n1 = no idea what this stands for, my room # also started with it\n\n2 = floor number\n\n3 = suite number\n\n4 = specific room number\n\nSo, it seems like you'll be living in the HILC's second floor in Suite 3's 4th room. Hope this helps!",

Or maybe the numbering is just inconsistent? No idea.\n\nRegardless, I'm not sure how many suites are in each Low Rise floor. There were 6 on each floor in Jameson, but I don't know if they can be compared.",

So I come to take the exam in person and low and behold I throw up halfway through into my mask and run to the bathroom. I come back out and he is waiting in the hallway, doesn\u2019t say anything and I ask him if he has another mask as mine is ruined, he says no but that I can take it while holding a paper towel over my face for the rest of the time. He then asked if I was the one who emailed him and I say yes, he doesn\u2019t say anything else. I ask if I can take the prelim in the hallway so i\u2019m not spreading my germs on everyone and he says yes, so I finish the exam throwing up one more time during the time. \n\nanother great look for the chem department\ud83e\udd20",

It\u2019s deeply problematic that other departments and faculty haven\u2019t got the memo, and completely unacceptable that this happened to you. Why the fuck wouldn\u2019t he just let you retake on a different day??? The prof I\u2019m working with and I have spent this whole semester creating a contingency plan for each class because of the potential for this exact problem, and even sans covid there should be a level of flexibility for illness.",

This has nothing to do with mask wearing and everything to do with a stupidly harsh decision made by an uncaring professor. Regardless of whether OP was wearing a mask or not, he/she shouldnt even have been in that room in the first place lol. You moaning about masks makes it sound like if only indoor masks werent mandatory, OP would have been perfectly fine. Now do you understand the stupidity of making this about masks? But you are so tone deaf and dense that you would rather exploit OP's suffering to use in your propaganda against masks. Good lord.",

I know I\u2019ve gone to some.\nWhat WOULD be wrong would be to allow people to not wear masks in class where others do not have the option of not attending if they don\u2019t want to be at risk of the germs being spread by someone not wearing a mask.

C's and B-'s when you're normally a B+/A student probably won't do you any favors.\n\nIt'd also just suck to have your GPA permanently go down a few points when you're so close to graduating.",

As a masters student applying to a PhD, your undergrad grades themselves matter a lot less compared to other factors.",

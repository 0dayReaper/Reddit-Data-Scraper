When I took it, the professor went over this a lot and also gave us a pdf going over how to solve them. It would help if you had taken differential equations but if you haven't, just make sure to pay extra attention when they go over this. Since they all follow the same pattern though it isn't that bad.\n\nWelcome to ECE :)",

Won\u2019t hurt if you try 2800 next semester tho, you won\u2019t know til you try it.",

            "comment": "If you know for sure that you want to be a software engineer, CS is the safest bet as a major. Not for what it teaches you, but for how the corporate world works. I\u2019ve seen a few reddit threads where hiring managers proudly proclaimed that they would not consider a resume from someone not in CS regardless of projects and experience. Those threads caused me a great deal of stress and misery for a while as an InfoSci major, but ultimately realizing that these types of people are a minority helped and so did talking to actual employed alumni rather than redditors on CS subs. Still, the fact is that these types of people do exist and will keep doing what they do, and with the volume of applications they must go through at the entry level they might find that filtering non-CS majors out makes their work easier while still producing good hires. It takes a bit more work to stand out and set yourself up to disprove the negative assumptions SWE hiring people will make about you for not being in CS.\n\nNow, if you liked CS 1110 and just want to take more courses like that, CS 2110 and CS 3110 are a must, and you would probably enjoy CS 5150 if/when that makes a return. The CS major isn\u2019t just composed of Data Structures &amp; Algorithms + programming-centric courses like these though, nor do you have to be a CS major to take all of these.\n\nCS 2800 is proof-based discrete mathematics and does not involve any written code, while 4820 is\nmore proofs work with algorithms. CS 3410 is computer architecture and hardware, and 4410 builds on much 3410 knowledge. If you liked 1110 there is no guarantee that you will like these, as they\u2019re pretty different and often have you doing a lot of logic and conceptual work where no code is ever being written.\n\nThe 1110+2110+3110 sequence may be just as well appreciated by a dedicated Computer Science major as an Information Science or Statistical Science major, or even an ORIE, ECE, or Computational Biology/other computational science major. Those courses teach you the fundamentals of software engineering and development, which are widely applicable to domains outside of pure SWE like Data Science. The CS major on the other hand is intended to give you a well rounded education in the fundamentals of *Computer Science*. Computer Science is an academic discipline that concerns itself with the study of computation and information. A Computer Scientist is not the same as a Software Engineer. What this means is that should you go into CS, you will have to learn many things that are not SWE related, and be exposed to a lot more scientific theory than practical engineering. SWE positions mandate a CS degree despite this difference because CS degrees are more or less a barrier to entry that says \u201cthis person is smart and is guaranteed to have taken these relevant courses\u201d.\n\nSo, do it only if you know you\u2019re willing to take it all\non and are set on becoming either a Computer Scientist or a Software Engineer. If you just like the courses, you can get up to 3110 without any issue in any major as CS enrolment preferences dont start being a thing until the 4k level.",

And I think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask us to make that on the spot. That\u2019s not giving us a fair chance to really look at all the implications.\u201d\n\nCompletely agree with Lombardi, and I'm no fan of Starbucks.",

If the university has responded months ago when Starbucks closed down the first unionized store (which is a reasonable expectation imo, given that Cornell includes one of the leading labor relations schools in the world)",

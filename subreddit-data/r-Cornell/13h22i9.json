    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m in a situation where I have 4 finals/deliverables due within 26 hours of each other (one of them being algo). I also had an important final yesterday so I didn't have much time earlier and operated under the assumption that at least one of the 4 finals/deliverables would get rescheduled. Turns out that none of the professors granted me an extension on the deliverables or let me reschedule my finals, since 2 of my finals/deliverables weren\u2019t listed on the official list of finals/deliverables\n\nIs there anything I can do to try and get an extension on the deliverables or have my finals rescheduled? Or am I screwed?  I'm currently on my 10th cup of coffee trying to focus and study as well as finish all my work",

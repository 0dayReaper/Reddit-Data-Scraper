            "comment": "I lived in Hu Shih this year and while dorms are assigned on presumed M/F-ness there wasn't really hard-defined male or female bathroom. Each pod has a bathroom on either side of the hallway (for its 5 residents). Afaik there is no functional difference between the bathrooms (they're all just shower + toilet + two sinks) and there is nothing stopping you from which one you choose to use. There is also no signage that says bathrooms are for men or women, only a sign telling you which days of the week they get cleaned. \n\nI'm a trans guy and never had an issue despite being assigned to the \"female\" half of the hall (but of course our circumstances are not the same). Not sure if any of that info helps you at all but I'm hoping that however your dorm situation resolves itself, you end up satisfied!",

My biggest complaint about Hu Shih is that it was rather plain-looking/sterile. It does not have the same more social vibe of a dorm like Donlon or Risley. I know folks who were well-connected on my floor, but afaik people really socialised the most within their own pod or outside the dorm entirely. Could've been just my own experience though. On all other fronts it was quite nice, bathrooms are clean, it was usually quiet in the hall, and it has air conditioning. \n\nYou definitely got one of the nicer dorms in terms of amenities. Good luck next year!",

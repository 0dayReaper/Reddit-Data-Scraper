    "postText": "In order to try to encourage people to stay safe and stay in quarantine, a couple of my friends and I are offering to go grocery shopping and run other essential errands for the people who are stuck inside right now. Here are the details:\n\n-We will deliver the stuff you need to you within a few hours. \n-There is no cost besides the cost of the things you need us to buy for you, but we are asking for donations if you would like to make a donation. Even just a dollar or two can help us pay for gas. \n-We can get anything you need from wegmans, target, greenstar, the Cornell store, and Walmart, and we are also able to pick up food from restaurants. \n\nPlease share this with anybody who you think might appreciate this service! Our #1 goal is to keep our community safe and help people who are in quarantine right now, but you do not have to be in quarantine to use this service. \n\nPlease contact me at (203) 675-8549 if you are interested in this service. \n\nWe will continue taking new orders as long as we have time, but we may become too busy and we may have to refuse new orders eventually. Right now, though, we can take a lot of new orders!",

Some people (especially if taking several grocery orders) will simply grab the first one off the shelf for the sake of alacrity. Others treat it like their own shopping, and try to grab the best product available. However, since their ability to get orders is dependant on having good reviews (not sure the mechanics behind this), they tend to ensure they don't grab anything bad (rotten/diseased cabbage, malpackaged cheese, etc). If need be, I believe there's a way to read the reviews of the person purchasing your food, so you can find out that way. If you find out this person has routinely been bringing bad food, you can cancel and find another instacarter I believe.",

I know Hu Shih is new, so I wanted to ask about how the layout is. Are there bunk beds? Is it a square or rectangle? Can it genuinely fit 3 people while having space to spare??",

            "comment": "Hu Shih triples are super nice. I was in one last year. No bunk beds, plenty of space, more of a rectangle than a square. Here's a pic of mine before we moved in (it was bigger in person, and this is one of the smaller triples - they're all slightly different inside).

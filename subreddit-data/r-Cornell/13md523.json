Good luck \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, jokes aside, it is a somewhat convoluted course I'm ngl, but essentially u'll learn about diffusion and fluid dynamics Peter Doerschuk style. I would not worry TOO much about it. Just be prepared to learn and ask questions",

Lucky....I mean as far as grading for the course is concerned, I mean I'm going to assume it's going to be slightly different with a new professor. With Peter, he didn't want to stress students out with prelims so grading was based on 6 quizzes, hw, and a semester project iirc. I apologize but I do not have the syllabus to the course, but hopefully I was able to hlep",

And the course itself wasn't why I dropped the BME major. I was alr taking the CS minor and was halfway done with the required cores at that point, so I decided to swap my major and minor. Additionally, the BME course path felt extremely rigid as courses were only offered specific semesters so it felt restricting to me but CS was more like take what you want when you want.",

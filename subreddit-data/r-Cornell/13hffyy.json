We take food safety very seriously at Cornell Dining, but unfortunately, isolated incidents can and do occur, not just here but in any food service setting. The leafy greens mix and spinach come to us precleaned and bag sealed, and all of the fresh fruits and vegetables are cleaned in a special food-safe cleaning solution and then rinsed and sealed in storage containers, and then cooled to 40 degrees before being panned up for service on the salad bar. \n\nGiven all the procedure we go through in preparation for the salad bar, one possibility is that this insect made its way through the kitchen or dining room doors and into the serving area. It's common this time of year for bugs to come inside when it is colder outside especially at night. Of course, since growing salad greens is a natural, outdoor process, it's also possible that an insect made it through the supply chain. When we focus on serving natural, healthful, whole foods, this is always a possibility. Our suppliers and our staff always do all they can to watch for insects and other materials that might be in, or make their way into, the food we serve, but it's impossible to guarantee this will never happen.\n\nI appreciate your sense of humor about your friend there! Feel free to let us know where this was so we can make sure the eatery's manager is aware.",

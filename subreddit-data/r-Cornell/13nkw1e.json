    "postText": "Hi I recently got accepted into the MPS AEM program and I\u2019m contemplating if this program is a smart move. Would the roi make sense esp considering the loans I\u2019d have to take to financially support myself through the program. If anyone is in this program or graduating/ed from it and can offer some advice I\u2019d really appreciate it!!",

It's more impactful if you went to a lower tier UG. It may not help too much if your UG is in Econ from Berkeley (for ex). Based on this, you can decide the ROI.",

But if you come in with no work experience, I would not expect much bump in job prospects a year later. Again, who da heck knows for sure \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nOne suggestion would be to work for a year or two and then spend $ on a Masters program?",

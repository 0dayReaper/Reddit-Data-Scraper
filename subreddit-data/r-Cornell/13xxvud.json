    "postText": "[https://wapo.st/3ORndVo](https://wapo.st/3ORndVo)\n\n\"Cohen grew up on [Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island) in the [Baldwin hamlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin,_Nassau_County,_New_York) in [Hempstead, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hempstead,_New_York). Her mother worked as a nurse practitioner in [emergency medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine), and inspired her to pursue a medical career. Cohen has a bachelor's degree in policy analysis and management from [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University).\"\n\nBut of course the WashPost article only mentioned she is Harvard/Yale trained.\n\nBTW, yesterday when I was watching the live House vote on the debt ceiling deal, NYT mentioned that the Democrats Whip did a good job on corralling more Democrats than Republicans to vote on yes on the deal.  The current Democrat Whip is Katherine Clark from MA 5th District.  She got her JD from Cornell in '89.",

I\u2019ve heard through the grapevine that Biden\u2019s a rather big fan of Cornell, perhaps because he studied in the area, at Syracuse\u2026",

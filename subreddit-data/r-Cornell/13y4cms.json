    "postText": "Hello! I'm internally transferring to AS, which means that I \\~, unfortunately, \\~ have to take a language.\n\nI haven't taken Spanish in four years now but am trying to complete the requirement as soon as possible so I plan on taking an intermediate course P/F this fall\u2014 either SPAN 2070 or 2090. Spanish was my worst subject throughout high school but the department was challenging, which is to say that I am pretty mediocre and don't remember all that much. I didn't take the CASE exam because it didn't require me to do so before pre-enroll.\n\nDoes this plan sound doable? If so, which class/professor should I take? Would also appreciate it if anyone could PM a syllabus for SPAN 1230, 2070, or 2090. If not, any reccs on ways to finish the requirement ASAP?",

Am alternative to finishing quickly is any introductory sequence that is 6 credits per semester, the obvious downside is an extra 6 credits per semester. But at least you don\u2019t need proper experience with the language.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the language requirement has to be graded? Maybe not, but every language class I\u2019ve looked at had that requirement on their own.",

I studied microbiology and Spanish was my hardest class that semester. Insane amount of homework, tricky prelims that are kinda unpredicatable. It legit sucks, esp bc the class is entirely in Spanish. To put it into perspective, the heritage speaker in my class sometimes didn't understand the professor. 2090 is also super depressing bc they want you to study real-world problems, so you end up reading/watching movies about terminal illness/climate change/ $exual abuse. I wouldn't recommend it at all.\n\nI get wanting to complete the requirement faster, I felt the same way. I even said that to my friend that took (an easy intro level) Italian class at Cornell. Her response was, \"Faster, yes. With less pain? No.\" She had to take several Italian classes, but had studied Spanish in high school. Starting one Romance language with a foundation in another is easier than starting from scratch. That's what I recommend, or do something like sign language, which I heard is fairly chill. But yeah, def skip Spanish",

If you haven\u2019t taken Spanish in four years and don\u2019t remember much, you won\u2019t be passing 2070 or 2090. You probably won\u2019t even be able to take 1230, you\u2019d have to start at 1210",

            "comment": "An alternative if ur dead set on finishing fast: Russian. They have one intro course that's five credits. It's a lot of hw, and it can be very tough, but the profs (esp Slava) are very nice. I had horrible pronounciation, often had to redo assignments for an A (which is allowed), usually needed help speaking in class, and felt confident on &lt; half of my answers on the final. I got a B+. Ngl, it's still a time-consuming class, but it'll get you a lot of credits fast. The optional speaking section is 1 credit, so you could get 6 credits in one semester.\n\nFrom someone that took Spanish 2090 and Russian, it seems like the Spanish dept wants you to be fluent and have perfect grammar. The Russian dept wants you to try. Like I said, still hard work, but because Slavic languages are tough for English speakers, it's graded much more generously than Spanish",

At least have some fun with it.\n\nHow many credits do you guys need?\n\nI just clicked on Japanese, for example, and the entry-level 1101 is 6 credits but with a class every day plus a twice-a-week lab.",

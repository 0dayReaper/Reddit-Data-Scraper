Even going with the low end (1/20 people), it's likely that in every class you have, there's one person with ADHD. It's not a rare disorder by any means, and it's not particularly strange to offer treatment for it. It's also likely that the amount of people with ADHD is more than the national average here anyways, simply due to the fact that if neurodivergent people have an interest in something they tend to spend (too) much of their time on it, and that really helps with getting into a high-tier college. I'm also not sure where your claim is that it's not 1 in 10 comes from. It's not like ADHD is glaringly obvious to onlookers. \n\nThere's also the point that for a lot of people, college \\*is\\* the first time that they can seek a diagnosis (this is not limited to ADHD) because of their situation back home. So I don't think there's any harm in telling the students who need help for their ADHD how to get it.",

A lot of medication has some serious side effects, not to mention that it can kill in high enough dosage. The reason that medicine exists is that it can be taken in amounts that will improve quality of life (or length of life), which is preferable to the alternative. There's no reason why the same logic shouldn't be applied to ADHD medication versus other medication.",

If they don't feel confident about it, you might want to pass if there is another person you can ask.  You should also talk to them about what you want to do and your passion regarding it.  That way they can write a better letter that is more personal.",

If you think the professor can represent you in a positive light from prior positive interactions, then go ahead and ask if they can write you a good letter of rec. They will tell you if they feel comfortable doing so.",

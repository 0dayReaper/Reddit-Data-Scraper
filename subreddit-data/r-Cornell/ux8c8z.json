The pyramid is such a classic in 1910 (Or any Calc 2 class, for that matter).\n\nI do wonder what happened this semester- Carl is normally a pretty good instructor. But even then I find the backbone of the 1910 pedagogy lacking for being the first course in the engineering sequence.",

I would think even taking that out of account, students at Cornell don't just not try. I would think there had to be something going on for the average to be so low from maybe how the material was handled or maybe the prelim schedules?\n\nIf students aren't trying and this was reflective of that, we would see this everywhere and I've never seen the averages so low before.",

We are graduating students who think they can pass classes without putting in any work because, well, they just spent 12 years in primary and secondary education being shuffled along, with the past two years being a specifically grotesque passfest where a pulse seemed to be the only requirement needed for a diploma.  \nI have been holding the line and failed students left and right, but my course is not required for graduation. My colleagues in core classes are basically being forced to pass everyone by administration and it is producing the sort of students who would actually fail an exam that reused homework questions.",

I struggled through my undergrad with getting overwhelmed and feeling stupid and getting bad grades on exams. It took a few years of working for me to develop better time management and studying habits. Thank goodness, because my master's was much easier as a result, even though my life circumstances were objectively more difficult.\n\nI no longer have access to my grades from 2008 of course, but the mean and median scores for at least one exam from math 192 when I took it in spring 08 were also somewhere in the 20s, though the standard deviations were tighter. I personally think low exam scores are indicative of some systemic problem either with the course or the teacher, though of course pandemic education is probably at least somewhat to blame here as well.",

I personally only had appointments with maybe 2 students this semester from 1910, and I respect those students for reaching out and trying to learn. At the ivy league level, people's pride tends to get in the way,  and as a result,  it appears that every one knows exactly what is happening, even tho the truth of the matter is, everyone needs a little bit of help. A lot of the students who take 1910 in the spring have either dropped the course in the fall,  failed the class, or a late transfer. Therefore, it is a relatively small class with a very low morale. The professor has the right to be mad tbh, he highkey handed them a free A if what he claimed in his email was true (that the exam was the exaxt same as the hw and prelim). However,  at the same time,  I would hate to feel like an idiot especially in my first year at a top school after being at the top of my high school,  and the pressure to \"keep up\" or \"catch up\" or \"playing from behind\" sucks. At the end of the day, I applaud the students for trying their best (if they actually did try their best of course),  and I rly do hope that this one class doesnt mess with their confidence and their hopes and dreams. But there definitely is a lesson in all of this.... It's okay to ask for help,  there are plenty of resources available to all of us at Cornell and I hope that every one reading this utilizes them when they can",

If you were part of this class, it may not work but perhaps schedule a conversation with the professor. Talk to him about that, ask him how it has been for him too.  If you are genuinely interested in your education around this topic, admit your mistakes (we all make them) and ask the hard questions of how can you improve upon this. If someone ever asks about a less than ideal grade in college and you have the response of \"It was a really trying time dealing with learning during COVID. I unfortunately did not perform per my expectations so I set aside some time to discuss things with the professor and [I retook the course and excelled, I took the next highest course, working with that professor to ensure I understood my mistakes in the prior course excelled, etc...something to show you took something that was less than ideal and persevered]\" that is a great response. And any employer who wouldn't accept that...it's not a place you want to work. To err is human as they say....what you do from there will show more about who you are than the mistakes. \n\nI'm sure this will get some down votes for some reason or another...I simply wanted to share that everyone can understand the difficulties students are facing and have faced and lend some support on how to move forward with mistakes or less than ideal grades.",

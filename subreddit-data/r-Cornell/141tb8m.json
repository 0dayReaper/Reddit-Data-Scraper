We are curious about your time here and the lessons you've picked up along the way about self, personhood, or society. What did you find here? How did this place change you? What do you want future generations to know about your experience here, and the state of Cornell as you're leaving it?\u00a0 We welcome all stories, positive **and** less than ideal; they are all welcome and necessary to capturing the institutional memory of our graduating class.\n\n[**Access the Google form here.**](https://forms.gle/RpVcvRQiBNpzU63Z9)\n\nYour voice and your story **matters**. We\u2019re here to preserve it. Questions? email [soulandkeysociety@gmail.com](mailto:soulandkeysociety@gmail.com) \n\n**DEADLINE: FRIDAY, JUNE 9th, 2023**",

But my guess is that if you move in on non move-in day, you won't have access to the move in parking spots +  moving cart + the help from student volunteers. You will need to find someone (RA or RH or anyone in Housing Office) to get your keys.\n\nCornell is neither a prison nor a military camp. As long as you pay your bills, for the first one or two weeks Cornell doesn't care exactly when you show up.",

    "postText": "Trying to get rid of a Razer Blackwidow TE Chroma V2 with yellow switches. If you've never used those, they don't have a click to them but they feel nice and have good travel, so it's a nice compromise between being mechanical and not being deafeningly loud. It's got RGB through the Razer desktop app if you're into that, but otherwise you can just plug it in and go. Comes with a wrist rest and cable that ends in a USB-A connector. I never used it tons, but I'll give it a deep clean before handing it off.\n\nBestBuy has it new for $140, I'll ask for $80.",

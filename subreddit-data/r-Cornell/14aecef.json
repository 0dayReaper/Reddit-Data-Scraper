Based on what I've been told, the leave of absence requirement is very difficult to appeal and you most likely will have to do what they say in the letter, but if you have documentation of progress with your illness, I would recommend talking to the leave of absence coordinator about your situation/ your major department undergrad advisor. Usually, you can count the semester you  started your leave in as one of the semesters. Either way, taking a break may be what is best for you, although I understand the feelings of stress associated with graduating late in the long run sometimes people just need more time to graduate and that's okay.",

Either way, I think contacting your departments advising office and your undergrad office would be the best way to get answers as to why they put you on leave and if there's anything you can do to get it appealed. Hopefully they can be of more help to you. \n\n\nAlso, if they don't budge on the leave of absence and you're worried about falling behind I would look into transferring credit from other universities/getting classes pre-approved for transfer. If you haven't hit the limit of transfer credits for your major and can afford it, it's a great way to keep on track. I hope they allow you to come back early though!",

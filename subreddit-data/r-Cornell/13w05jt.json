            "comment": "Major chains including Marriott, Hilton, and Choice do not accept reservations until about 350 days out. Today is 360 days to May 24, 2024, so lack of availability may reflect the inability of the hotel to sell you the room through their reservations system, not that they are already full. Try again in ten days.\n\n(On a related note, most airlines begin releasing seats 330 days before the flight, so don't panic that flights are \"sold out\" already either).\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\* You can also call the hotel directly to see if they will take a reservation rather than wait for it to appear online. This might be a way of beating the crowd if you have a particular property in mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, there is no particular reason you need to choose an Ithaca hotel. There are hotels in Dryden, Cortland, and Watkins Glen, and a little farther out are the much bigger markets of Syracuse and Binghamton which are unlikely to reach capacity.\n\nIf you're unable to get a hotel or vacation rental, Cornell does offers some Commencement housing in its dorms, from $270 to $1890 (for all three nights as a package): [https://scl.cornell.edu/residential-life/housing/campus-housing/commencement-housing-campus](https://scl.cornell.edu/residential-life/housing/campus-housing/commencement-housing-campus) . Some fraternities and other small living units also offer Commencement housing.",

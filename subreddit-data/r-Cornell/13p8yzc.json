Covid is not as prevalent as it used to be, there is no excuse to where you can\u2019t meet your person outside unless you physically can\u2019t. When the person drops off the bag you have to go pick it up anyway, so unless you\u2019re deathly allergic to social interaction I don\u2019t see why people even pick the drop off option.",

So I have to give them declare it missing (because where the hell is it??), all because they fail to communicate, or ask someone else to let them into the building. Instead they just leave it somewhere or steal the order",

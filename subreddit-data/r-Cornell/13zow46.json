    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm wondering what would be best options for Fall 2023 housing for InfoSci Masters students in Ithaca. I do intend to apply for Hasbrouck since it's on campus (does anyone know whether it's filled already), but are there any other areas I should be looking at (especially ones where I'd still be able to find a furnished room/apartment)?\n\nThank you very much!",

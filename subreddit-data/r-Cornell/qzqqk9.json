Today it was freezing cold and snowing, and these two workers had to hand scrub the square outside Mann with water. We all are trying to raise awareness but the ones cleaning those signs aren\u2019t Marta or Ryan, but the minimum wage workers of Cornell. And that doesn\u2019t feel right, and to an extent against the whole point.",

There are many highly ranked universities like U Chicago, UC Berkeley, or Columbia that regularly have gunshots within walking distance of campus and they never shut down.

I was a freshman when the Virginia Tech  shooting happened - at another school, but I had friends there (the dorm was a freshman dorm) and two people killed were from my hometown as was the shooter. The reason the shooter was able to kill so many people was because the school did not inform any of the students after he shot and killed someone in the freshman dorm. Classes went on as normal and he accessed a packed building an hour or two after the initial shooting happened. Had they canceled classes or even just alerted students, things may have been different. We\u2019ll never know.\n\nSo whether it\u2019s true that shootings happen frequently near other schools or not, that\u2019s irrelevant. Tons of horrible things happen all the time, that doesn\u2019t mean we should become desensitized to it. I also don\u2019t know that that\u2019s true, it actually sounds like you\u2019re stereotyping those three locations. I live in a city with a fair amount of violence (New Orleans), and when I was getting my master\u2019s we were informed of all known violence and threats near UNO or on campus. Part of the reason we have these alerts is because of what happened at Virginia Tech, the impact was that wide reaching.\n\nI don\u2019t see how having an expectation of alerts of threats or violence is unreasonable. At Tech they assumed it was an isolated domestic violence situation and were unconcerned about a mass shooting. They were wrong. The consequences of alerting people of danger when there is none is far less than the consequences of not alerting people when it turns out there is a serious threat. Better safe than sorry. Thirty two people died.",

While I do agree maybe the graffiti wasn\u2019t the right move, don\u2019t gaslight the experiences of these students without 1) fully knowing what the cause is for and 2) assuming your experience is the same as these students. If most of ya took time to read the demands and meet the students who were organizing, you\u2019ll see that these are hardworking students of color, some first gen and low income, who had a hard time during the pandemic. Not all of us, during the pandemic, had the luxury of quarantining and watching TikTok\u2019s all day. Some of us had to be essential workers and see their whole world crumble for a year. These comments display the privilege many of you guys have. These are students who probably already didn\u2019t have good mental health (because being a student of color here in this elitist campus is taxing) and the stress of the semester has been adding on to their mental distress. Now on top of that, we get both a bomb threat, and a shooter alert in one week. If you can\u2019t empathize with the stress that those events caused for some people, that\u2019s perfectly fine. However, try to be a supportive peer instead of dismissing the impact that had for other people.",

First I believe that if someone is suffering from any form of mental distress about anything they should get help.  There are plenty of ways to get counseling, maybe not on campus I haven't tried, but there is a whole community that is available.  I think the people that need help should get it, however, to demand the school basically shuts down because of the bomb threat and lockdown is way too far reaching.  I don't remember when I got the email from Ryan Lombardi but it was Sunday night or Monday morning.  We all have histories that we carry with us and all of our experiences are different, so the response should be the same.  I think and this is only my opinion, most students would agree that the demands are too far reaching.  Most of the students in the school have been experiencing lockdown drills for their entire school experience.  Some students not only didn't sit home and watch Tik Toks but waited to hear is parents were coming home from the hospital from experiencing Covid.  So I agree we can't generalize where these students are coming from, and we can not generalize what these students need to handle obstacles.  Some of the demands do have merits, but mental health is as individual as a fingerprint it is individual. Was the situation handled perfectly, no, will the demands help maybe for a few or some, but for others not so much.",

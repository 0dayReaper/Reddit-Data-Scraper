I think in most cases, you\u2019ll need to write a better \u201cwhy is this happening\u201d thing than you did before, and convince admin you have a reasonable plan to improve. Maybe they\u2019ll ask for a zoom meeting to discuss things.\n\nIf you failed every class in both semesters and enrolled in under 12 credits both times and had 0% attendance in a class that took it and lit Ganedago on fire and got caught or something like that, they\u2019ll probably force you to take a leave for a semester/year and have you submit a plan to come back, but idk what you\u2019re on probation for so I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not that bad yet.\n\nI\u2019ve known people on both ends and they\u2019ve all been fine in the end, I\u2019m sure you will too, even if this doesn\u2019t mean much now.",

I emailed her and she responded with pretty generic response even after I asked for my final grade and like grade breakdown with numbers . Who can I email about this since the deadline is Tomrow ( so like who would be able to help since she is just ignoring my requests? This is engineering CS 4000+ course .",

You\u2019ll have to find a clause that your professor didn\u2019t follow but if you do I have had success in getting grades changed at a different school by writing a short essay describing the situation and citing the specific guidelines that the professor didn\u2019t follow",

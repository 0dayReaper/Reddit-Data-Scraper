Kids took their midterms and I was tasked with grading them so I took them home to my apartment for the weekend to grade and was also tasked with returning them to the students in class Monday (prof was going to be out of town, so I had to return the exams and walk through the answer key for lecture).\n\nFriday night there was an arson fire set in the apartment directly below mine (SERIOUSLY UNFUN FACT, one of my students from that class actually was hooking up with the guy in the apartment that night and died in the fire).  In my haste to book out of the apartment, I left the exams in my room\u2026\n\nThankfully, they didn\u2019t get burned or water damage and the police let me retrieve them late Sunday afternoon (police tape everywhere because of the arson).  Stayed up all night grading and walked into class Monday morning wearing the same (now fragrant) clothes and looking like crap.  Prof actually was there (don\u2019t recall why) so I told him what happened and what I was planning to do next\u2026he agreed.\n\nTold the kids what happened that weekend but said the exams were lost so they needed to clear their desks because we were going to be administering another midterm right then.  Panic ensued.\n\nProf and I laughed as we passed out the completed/graded exams back\u2026all except one.  She had the highest grade on the exam too, I found out a few days later that she had died in the fire \ud83d\ude22\n\nTook me a long time to get over that\u2026",

First problem was the renters had a gas can on their back porch (I think one of them owned a scooter) which was prohibited by our leases.  Next you throw in a friend-of-a-friend of one of the roommates that was hanging out that afternoon watching TV and drinking...roommate went to work but friend-of-friend kept hanging out and drinking.  Other roommate changed TV channel which apparently pissed off the friend-of-friend, so when the roommate went into his bedroom with hook-up (my student), gas was thrown in his room and torched.  Completely fucked up - had there been no gas canister, likely nothing would have happened.  Both the girl and the roommate died in the fire.  I was in my apartment, heard the initial explosion of gas and saw smoke coming up side of the building, so I called 911 within seconds.  Fire and rescue was there quickly and got the fire out quickly, but the students were already dead.  I didn't find out she was my student until several days later when the names were released and it clicked why she hadn't picked up her exam...  Dude who caused the fire turned himself in to the authorities and that was the last I heard of him.  Not even sure if he was a student at the university or not.",

    "postText": "This is a quote from Kitaro Nishida, a man who lived through the death of his family, both world wars, and the transcendent cultural shifts Japan went through during his life. Despite all of this, he continued his writings, perhaps he found solace in his work, or maybe simply sharing his understanding of the world was enough.   \n\n\nThis will always be my favorite quote/line from literature.   \n\n\nI have dealt with many personal issues as of late, doubts with my major/ career /life trajectory, the end of a long term relationship, family health issues, feelings of deep isolation and loneliness,  you name it really.   \n\n\nThese events have been very hard on me, and yet, there is a part of me that lives on unfazed. In fact, that part is the truest me there is. Be it in my work, my forms of creative expression, even the cathartic experience of posting on this reddit, my soul and creative endeavors extend beyond the sorrows which have plagued my life as of late.   \n\n\nI find this notion very powerful, to not be defined by the waves of sorrow and joy which we all experience is perhaps the greatest freedom. Freedom from self in a sense.   \n\n\nI would encourage you to reflect on these words, whether you be in a period of joy or sorrow, recognize that the depths of your soul, your very humanity, is beyond the plights of this world.",

    "postText": "Hi, so I'm considering doing the Early Admit M. Eng. program. I have currently an Info Sci Major who has taken 2110, 3110, 2800, and 4820, Multi Var and Linear Alg. however, I have not yet taken 3410 which is in the [list of prerequisites for the CS Early Admit M. Eng. program](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/masters/apply/prerequisites) . I was wondering if taking 3410 is a must for getting admitted into the Early Admit M. Eng. \n\nAre they super strict on Prereqs and my chances are significantly lowered if I don't take 3410 or is this more of a rule of thumb. Does anyone have experience with this? Any guidance is much appreciated, thanks!",

    "postText": "I have been going through a pretty shit time but decided to push through my classes this semester. However, I ended BIOG 1440 with a C+ which has me really worried. I know if I retook the course I could get at least a B+ but I am not sure if it is worth it because I would be retaking it soph year spring with the same professors. I am pre-med trying to transfer into biological sciences at CALS and I am pretty certain this C+ is going to wreck my chances to internally transfer next semester. Any advice on what to do? My advisor keeps on ghosting me \ud83e\udd72",

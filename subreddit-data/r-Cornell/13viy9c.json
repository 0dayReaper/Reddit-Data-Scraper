    "postText": "I'm a new student with little CS foundation. I self-studied some basic knowledge of Python, and would like to take CS1110 in the first semester. I'm also interested in taking ENGRI 1620. However, it pre-request CS 1110.  Engineering students can take CS 1110 concurrently, so I wonder have anyone taken these two together? Will this be difficult? I'll be more than grateful if you can share your experience!",

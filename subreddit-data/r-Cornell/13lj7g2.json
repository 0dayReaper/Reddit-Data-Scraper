I\u2019m not worried about the college freshman gpa requirement rn - but does anyone know how much they truly care about the high school gpa/transcript part of it?? \n\nwith senioritis and all my grades suffered a lil (nothing too major honestly just a bunch of Bs LOL) and my gpa might have gone down a little but I honestly assumed they would NOT care because if be a sophomore in college by the time I came to Cornell, so I thought they\u2019d care more about the college freshman gpa. i don\u2019t think my first year college even cares about my final grades much LMAO so Cornell better not \n\nAny input appreciated thanks!",

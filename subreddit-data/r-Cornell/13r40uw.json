    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was accepted as a sophomore transfer! I'm excited, but also incredibly nervous and conflicted.\n\nI'm currently a student at Barnard. I hate being a Barnard student. I hate how Columbia College students treat us like we're not as smart, as good, or as deserving as them and that we're not \"real\" ivy league students. I love NYC, but I feel like I'm missing out on the traditional college experience (do people go to sports games, for example?). I do not feel academically challenged at or enjoy the environment of my small liberal arts college. There's no real campus community. I hate being expected to go to downtown bars for a social life. But, as a theatre person, I love being in the city though I know I'll end up in NYC post-grad for my career. Does anyone here have any insight into the on campus theatre community or community theatre in Ithaca? Another reason I want to leave Barnard is because the performing arts community has not been welcoming at all. \n\nSpeaking of a \"traditional college experience\", I joined a sorority that doesn't have a chapter at Cornell. Are there non-panhellenic sororities and pre-professional frats and what are they like? Are they solely resume padders or do they have similar cultures/environments to panhellenic groups? Cornell not having my sorority is one of my very few (but very strong) hesitations about leaving. I only really found community at Barnard starting in April and that was because of my sorority. \n\nI'm so worried about starting over especially when I only started to make friends at the very end of my first year at Barnard. I am SO conflicted. Can anyone give any insights, both transfer and non-transfer students? I'd appreciate it so, so much.",

            "comment": "No one is really being helpful so I'll chime in.\n\nI always knew if I did not go to Cornell I would have wanted to go to NYU, and while I know there is a huge difference between Barnard and NYU, I'll show you how I justified my own Cornell experience (non-transfer).\n\nIthaca is fantastic and gorgeous in its own right, but Cornell is very much its own community. Effectively when you're not in the town of Ithaca and on Cornell's huge campus, you are surrounded by all Cornell-related people, and when you're on campus, or in Collegetown, or bars in Collegetown you will always be with Cornell students and can rightly assume every person you run into is a Cornell person. So you really do get the full college campus experience. I think entering the Cornell bubble is a huge plus (but it is really immersive and nothing like being in the city at all).\n\nPerformance-wise, I was in a comedy group and felt like it was super welcoming and I was really able to shine there as the theater community is small-ish and not a super competitive program. I'm now in NYC, and I can tell you the Cornell groups are extremely welcoming compared to some of the things I have seen in NYC so far. And it was also super welcoming to transfers which would be great for you!\n\nSports-wise there is not much going on, but someone mentioned hockey, and I really enjoyed being able to go to hockey games and cheer for Cornell. But it seems like that was sort of branching off of a want for school spirit and Cornell-centered activities which there is no shortage of - see my first paragraph about how you can end up in the Cornell bubble.\n\nAnd especially if you're in the performance circles, the sorority stuff will not matter as much. I can't really speak from experience as I was in a fraternity, but I was splitting my social time with my group and frat and there is certainly an opportunity to have done that fully and go to other parties (maybe a regret of mine was not going to more non-frat parties??)\n\nWhile there is no comparison to NYC, and if you know you want to end up there post-grad anyway, Ithaca is a really cool place to have the college experience and seems to check many of the boxes you presented.\n\nIt's tough to boil down 4 years of experience into a few paragraphs, and for that to help you make a big life decision, so feel free to reach out with any more q's you may have! Best of luck!",

            "comment": "People are comparing Barnard to Cornell, NYC to Ithaca, but not really speaking to your main concern about starting over with friends/community. That's definitely not something to take lightly, leaving those friends you've started to make. I think it was right for me; I wouldn't be where I am in my career or in life if not for transferring in sophomore year, but I do think about the friendships I would have kept had I stayed with my freshman year school and friends. Obviously you can still make great friendships after that, and a lot of my post-college Cornell friends are people I met senior year or even after graduation. Just be ready for it to be a bit more challenging than it is as a freshman with everyone being equally vulnerable and open to making new friends.\n\n&gt; I hate how Columbia College students treat us like we're not as smart, as good, or as deserving as them and that we're not \"real\" ivy league students.\n\nThey say we're not real ivy league too lol.",

I just don't love it there.\n\nThe only part I really enjoy are the friends I've just started to make... So maybe I'm just a little clueless about how much it really means to go to a school with a better department for your major (not first gen on paper but not in contact with family who did go to college so I don't really have any guidance), but I feel that the biggest factor in me transferring is deciding if I want to restart on friendships and on finding community in theatre.",

I got lucky and got placed in a dorm on West Campus with 4 other sophomore transfers so we were all in the same situation.\n\nIt's probably worth getting thoughts from someone more experienced in the field you're interested in (does archaeology imply that you'll be spending another 4~5 years in grad school?) They might be able to speak to the opportunities in the programs that you would get at Barnard vs Cornell vs Penn. You could try to cold message some on linkedin.",

I\u2019ll refrain from speaking out of turn about current choices in theater (though it sounds much the same and that tradition sentimentality and connection to the past was huge then too) since my experience is old, so I\u2019ll say that one the Cornell community is always going to be real because of the campus setup, the nyc connections stay STRONG long after graduation, and while I was in a sorority I wasn\u2019t the most involved; I worked three jobs, I managed the football team, I bartended and I worked in the admissions office and all led to more community feels and fun and school pride. As someone who grew up in nyc I too knew I\u2019d make it back to the city after and I couldn\u2019t be more glad I spent those four years away from the city, the subways, the work life crowds because those will always be there for decades to come to have a blast in. Still in midtown east, still loving the nightlife here and the day to day around the city, I wouldn\u2019t trade the days in Ithaca for anything. \n\nI remember the theater productions fondly, the extra courses you can\u2019t get here like military riflery, fly fishing, I wonder if they still have skiing and other options, having the ornithology area, the art museum, the landddd and gazebos, watching my friends on the equestrian team, swimming in the gorges, having town to wander around. Manhattans not going anywhere that quickly ;). Personally it was no contest for me and not a day I spent up there including senior weeks, music festivals, and summer time and visiting after graduating would I trade for even the absolutely amazing times I have had and still have here in the city. After graduating I lived in the village by nyu, then in FiDi, now midtown east, I love it all, but never would I give those years up up there.",

There are also many, many pre-professional Greek organizations that range from resume-padders to *very* social. \n\nOn the other, sports aren\u2019t huge (aside from hockey, but even then, it\u2019s more of an occasional thing to go to games rather than something many people are passionate about), there\u2019s no cohesive campus community here either (the school is way too big and disjoint for that), and Ithaca is the polar opposite of NYC. I\u2019ve lived in mostly urban or suburban areas, and the rurality of Ithaca was hard for me to wrap my mind around. Despite what many say, if you\u2019re used to NYC, it won\u2019t feel like a \u201csmall city\u201d \u2014 it will feel very, very rural. \n\nAcademics are rigorous. I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed there, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. Classes have been great, in my experience. \n\nThere\u2019s no generalizing the student body. The students really, really, really vary. In every which way. It\u2019s all who you fall in with. \n\nFeel free to dm with any questions, wishing you the best on your decision!",

Socially, I 100% believe you should transfer for a more typical college experience, its something you will regret missing out on, whether it be studying with friends, enjoying the weather outdoors, frat parties, etc. When I studied at NYU, i felt the social life was a bit isolated and stiff due to the lack of college community being in the city, and Cornell is a breath of fresh air in that aspect. It also sounds you can probably enjoy city life after graduation, which is all the more reason Cornell's experience is a limmited opportunity.\n\nIm sorry to hear about your experience as a barnard student looked down upon by columbia college students. At cornell there are much less percieved prejudice by major or college. Anecdotally, ive never been judged differently when people find out I'm a transfer. \n\nI cant personally tell you which academic experience will be better(im an engineering major), but I hope others can help chime in on that.",

PMA has solid and incredible facilities, the professors are kind, professional, and top notch.\n\nthere's two particular theater groups i'd like to highlight. \n\nteatrotaller, the latinx theater troupe (i think comp lit is the one that's running it now, if not lsp) has a spring course that's kind of POL oriented where the whole semester is putting on a play (when i was a student it was a good scripted play but the last years we've been more centered in cooperative non-hierarchical theater.) cornell paid my trip to present the play with the troupe in ecuador (it was two weeks and got exempted from schoolwork while we were out. we climbed mountains and tried coca leaves and participated in an international theater festival and it was hands down one of my most worthwhile experiences while i was there.)\n\nimprov at risley is also incredibly good. i've seen alums from the whistling shrimp doing profitable standup all around the world. \n\nif what you're into is musical theater, you can go to IC and take some classes there. their alums end up in disney and broadway. their music department is also incredible and a great complement to the more rigorous focus of cornell music.",

Melodramatics Musical Theater Troupe\n2. CogDog (they do plays, can be pretty obscure)\n3. Shakespeare Troupe\nI\u2019ve been a part of the Shakespeare troupe as well as Risleys annual production of Rocky Horror. I\u2019ve also lived in Risley for two years and will be living there for a third next year. The theater community here is extremely welcoming and always want new people (I had never acted in a real production before). This year we also got to go on a dorm trip to NYC to see Moulin Rouge which was a lot of fun. \n\nSo no the theater seen is not NYC level because there\u2019s literally no way that\u2019s possible, but there are still a lot of opportunities here. \n\nI also didn\u2019t mention that there\u2019s the performing arts center which has a lot of other productions, Hangar Theater, and some people do go to shows at Ithaca College which has a very good program!",

During NSOP alone I had two different people come up to me while I was on main campus and tell me I didn't deserve to be there and to \"go back to your side of the street.\" CC was always my dream school, but I applied ED to Barnard because I liked the tour better and, as someone who is first gen,  had zero clue what I was doing. I regret not believing in myself and for not applying to CC because I did have the qualifications to get in. \n\nI feel that Barnard is an elite school. That it's a small lac with access to the resources of a huge research institution. I liked how socially undergrads mixed regardless of what college they're in. I just was raised my whole life being compared to Rory Gilmore so not having that ivy title feels really hard sometimes. \n\nI'm hoping to tour Cornell in two weeks, it's just hard getting there from FL but I'm working it out!",

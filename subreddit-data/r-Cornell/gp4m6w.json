    "postText": "Hey there professors, \n\nI used to love the subjects and content you taught, and I used to love what you've taken the time to show me. In my time as a physics student, I've seen abstract, complex concepts hidden in the most ordinary of objects. I'm sure I don't need to explain to you the joys of discovering these things; you've all dedicated a large share of your lives to these subjects of your passion. What I'm not so sure you're aware of is this: you guys and I (I guess it's mostly me, but I don't for a moment pretend I'm solely responsible) have made this past semester a living hell for me.\n\nI'm writing this in the wake of my PHYS 3318 final, which was due at 1:30 am. I'm writing this because I dont know where else to put it, I don't want to sleep, I'm not just here to whine and I simply don't know what to do anymore. After this last exam, the original plan was to sleep right away and be done with my semester, but instead I stayed up, sat on the living room carpet, and cried. Even though I ran out of time at the 1:30am mark I just turned in my incomplete exam and kept going until 3, I couldn't come to terms with sleeping 3 hours a day for the past two months for these classes just to demonstrate to myself in 5 hours that I've basically learned nothing. All the loss and soul sucking among of work I've gone through in the past semester culminating in half a test I've no clue how to do. I wanted there to be something I could do, but there wasn't it was over, and so I sobbed my heart out. It's not your fault and again it isn't completely mine either, but I felt robbed, robbed of my family, deprived of my health, deprived of my passion, I gave it my all and now it's all over before I had a chance to try.\n\nDuring the three week break I studied nonstop until 2am to catch up and gain some mastery over my courses, and when classes started up again and 2am wasnt enough, I stayed up until 4am to get problem sets done. I rewatched lectures, took additional notes, worked examples through myself, and went to office hours. When office hours didn't work since the UTAs there were given no solutions, vetting, or training, and only gave \"yep! You're on the right track! That looks right to me!\" I stared at problem sets on my own afterward, and prayed I could finish them before the end of the week. You guys weren't making it easy either, since when I went to you professors for help all I got was the same \"great! Figure it out, interesting stuff! Don't worry you'll be fine!\" as if I'm pulling an all nighter every day and gonna be fine, when every problem is a challenge problem and is worded vaguely and the slightest misinterpretation of the problem could land me a C grade for that week's homework. All this time I'm suffocating and have to take care of my mother, who is ailing in health but is more concerned about my hospitalized grandmother and she was right to worry because in April she passed away and I remember that day we heard the news and all I remember really feeling was stress about finishing this weeks damned math and physics psets on time. As if I wasn't heartless enough of an ingrate when my mother passed away this month and I had to call the ambulance not knowing if she was going to be okay I kept thinking about the stupid curve on that prelim, how if she was hospitalized I wouldn't have enough study time, I hated myself for it then and I hate myself now. It's insane, comical even that I'm here writing about my deceased mother and grandmother like they're just points on a timeline, I remember wanting to make my mother proud but who the hell is proud of a soulless deskbound daughter anyway, not like she's around anymore to be proud or mad or disgusted anyway. This semester's turned me into something I hate, when I was crying earlier I remembered all the movies we said we'd watch together and how she would teach me to crotchet when I had time and I see what I've really ruined, all because I was so busy putting out these fires in my academics. \n\nI hate being melodramatic and exaggerative, but said as plainly as possible, I'm not so much angry as I am simply spent emotionally. Now that I'm at the end of the semester, I compare what I've lost to what it ended up being for, and it kills me that now I've ended up doing all this to have to choose which classes to S/U among lousy b range grades. Physics is clearly not for me, and yet I do not know what else I could do with myself. I just want it all to end. In retrospect, it was naive of me to think that Cornell is an idyllic place of learning, and that learning would come with effort. The withering cutthroat academic culture here has dug away at my passion for physics and mathematics, and I have nothing left to hold onto or be happy about. You could say I did this all to myself, but here's what infuriates me. Earlier last week, my undergraduate research PI explained to me the strict department quotas professors have for issuing grades, and how they'll do anything to create that distribution. This includes all the 15-page problem sets, those curveballs you threw right at my head on tests, all the vaguely worded challenge problems, the times you assigned an open  canvas-only notes exam, only to sneak in a few \"typos\" in key equations in the lecture notes. The questions you shrugged off one way or another, the way you mystify things, I see that your ugly side, and how you've pitted yourself against your students to produce that grade distribution. I hate that my PI pointed this out to me, it's the ugliest thing I've had to face and I still have a hard time believing the people I though my mother would be proud to see me with act with these ulterior motives. As I struggled to hold on to my sanity and family this semester, you didn't just look on. You pushed me down and held my head underwater. Well, I'm done. You win. Had I woken up to this earlier I would have tried reporting this, but you've managed to even keep me busy past course evaluations. I've spent every last shred of my will to live, act, or learn. I really hope you got your quota, and I really hope you're happy.\n\n\nedit: words can't express how grateful I feel for all the support I've gotten in the past eight hours. I'm getting around to reading every dm and I feel like I'm no longer so alone. As a fairly down to earth physics girl, I never expected words from strangers to keep me going. As I've said to those of you who sent me private messages, I'm starting to gradually come up out of rock bottom, and a big part of that process is knowing I have a community who cares for me. I had zero composure while writing this post, and pouring my heart over a reddit post seemed stupid and pointless, likely to get written off as another complaining post. I only wanted to see one or two excited physics freshmen searching for physics advice here to see the struggles that Cornell really puts their students through in STEM, and expected this post to otherwise get lost in the fold of this reddit community.\n\nTo whoever gave me the platinum award, thanks a ton, but after finding out it costs money to award people on reddit, I think I should find a way to give it back. I think it should be clear I wasn't here to get \"karma\", or \"reddit gold\". Your words have been more than enough.\n\nI want to add that after much thought and reflection I don't have any personal, hard feelings towards my professors, but rather I wanted to express the academic setup here at Cornell that has hurt so many students, but still gets accepted as almost, unavoidable, and swept under the rug, even though it is so very possible to enact change.\n\n**I realize that I've unintentionally singled out Professor Maxson's PHYS 3318, which was not at all the central reason behind my semester of agony. Professor Maxson, if your reading this, please know that I enjoyed the fun lectures you gave us, and the contagious energy you gave to everyone in the room. It simply never matched up with the harrowing expectations in the homework and tests, which I felt I could never live up to. I hope you understand that this was the culmination of stress from all the classes in a particularly crushing semester, and I hope you understand it's nothing personal when I say I wish to remain anonymous, since I don't feel ready yet, if ever, to come forward with this. In the end, I want to thank you for reaching out. By no means was any of this anyone's fault in particular, and I hate to see you worried like this.**\n\n**please read: I am okay, please don't call CUPD on me, those who are close to me already understand my situation and know I'm getting better.**, though I briefly contemplated suicide I never took it seriously, knowing what my mother has done to get me here to Cornell. I've removed a certain controversial line above, since I don't think it would be fair to burden my professors (who I still to some degree admire as the heroes I saw them as in high school) mentally with that kind of responsibility. I am in fairly good health, and my father has signed me up for therapy. Please don't worry about me; I wanted to delete this account, but will continue to use it, lest you guys be concerned about my kinda reckless outburst about suicide. I am faithful I'm going to get through this, though I know now **I couldn't have done it without you guys.**",

B students here are more hardworking and diligent than A students I have worked with anywhere else. And I find it hard to differentiate between A/B students out of the dozens of peers I've worked with and the hundreds of hours I've spent with them. But I guess a 5 hour exam by some prof through zoom during a pandemic will do just fine!!!!\n\nBut I digress. Physics is not about these ridiculous metrics. Physics is about struggling and overcoming. You have experienced struggles far greater than those of any of these people born in their reams of academia\u2014unaware of the outside world\u2014will ever endure. I hope you reignite your passions in the subjects, because I have no doubt in my mind you're going to make great contributions. Your perspective is needed in the scientific community.",

As I read this, I cried knowing that you are suffering alone. It truly breaks my heart to know that you are going through this and I wish I could take away the pain. (Please send me a message if you want someone to talk to).\n\nIn my time at Cornell I have consistently found myself asking if all of the academic stress and emotional pain is worth it. To this day, I still cannot answer this question. This semester helped me put things into perspective and helped me recognize that there is nothing that is worth sacrificing your mental health for. I also find myself consistently asking how I will make it through. I do not know if, how, and when I will, but I hope that the pain will fade. Ever since my first semester here, I have contemplated taking my own life on several occasions. I have come close several times, but this semester completely stripped me of all of my happiness and barreled me until I could not fight anymore. \n\nYou did NOT do this to yourself, you are NOT at fault. There is nothing wrong with crying because expressing your pain does not make you weak. I know that right now it feels like you are drowning, but please take time to heal and recuperate. Please take care of yourself and reach out to me if you need to talk; you've definitely got a friend in me. I wish you all the best, and I will definitely be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.\n\nWe must not succumb to this madness, but rather rise up against it, becoming stronger than we were before.",

There were several gross Psets that I wouldn't even want to think of. But TBH, I really like the content of this course. The moment of knowing how similarly HJE and Schrodinger equations get to be is one of the most unforgettable experiences of learning physics to me.\n\nBTW when I was fcked up by the RPCC's foods, Prof. Maxson gave me a pretty generous extension on one of the psets.

They offer counseling through phone or zoom vid call.\n\nYou can also consider talking to some professors. They are generally kind people who will try to help you in any possible way. They can also give you more advice and perspective on the academics end.\n\nNow that the final is over, please take some time to heal. Find little enjoyments in life that you might have missed in the past couple of months. Then I hope you can regain ur passion in physics.\n\nI think you don't give enough credit for yourself. what you just went through and did...you are unbelievable.

I have no idea what kind of stress or pressure Cornell students are under and the only reference I have is from stories and rumors. I go to a small tech school in the northeast, so I do sorta get the love and passion for the subject of sciences or engineering, and consequently the stresses and pressure and feelings of inferiority you get when you see people effortlessly doing what took you grueling, tear-filled hours to complete. But the only thing I might almost understand about your situation is the loss of a parent. My father died 2 months ago, and I was all the way across the country when it happened. I didn\u2019t get a chance to say goodbye because staying near school to quarantine was for some reason easier or more convenient then coming home, and having to deal with a time zone difference. I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m writing all this, except to say that if you need to talk, shoot me a message. I\u2019m happy to just sit and listen or have a conversation. Maybe it\u2019ll help me too who knows. Anyway, I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re doing ok. This shit sucks, but we\u2019re gonna be alright.",

But if it makes you feel better, even if your grade in 3318 is not that great, I promise you have learned important physics. You now know what Lagrangians and Hamiltonians are and how to use them. You know about the different kinds of fictitious forces and how they're used to model a range of phenomena. You have significantly deepened your understanding of mechanics. I admit it's not a great trade for the lives of your family, but that's not the trade you made. We can always spend more time with our family before they die, but I think that very inclination is proof of your feelings which are what really matter. Forget about your grade in the class. It isnt proof of your efforts or your understanding and can only depress you. I hope you can take some solace in the fact that if your goal was to learn physics, you did learn it, despite the way this class was conducted.",

I can relate to most of what you said... this semester has been one of the worst because, for the first time in a long while, I was enjoying what it is I was being taught. But I always felt like there was a constant battle of trying to hold onto my passion for these subjects and professors doing whatever they can to rid me of it. I take comfort in knowing that while it would be great to have a high GPA, it's better for me if I just focus on learning and let everything else come second.\n\nI'm truly sorry for everything that has happened to you this semester but I hope you push on and let time heal the pain that may seem unbearable right now. I hope you allow yourself to become a light in other people's lives.

Two years ago I transferred out of Cornell after two semesters - I had dreamed of going to Cornell, and I made a wealth of new friendship there, and I still love the campus, but it took going through absolute mental hell and ending the spring semester with 7 credits to realize that Cornell is the kind of environment where one has to essentially devote their livelihood to academia, and that is not the life I want to, or can, live. I hesitate to talk with people about my college career and to mention that I attended Cornell because there's always the confused look and perplexed questioning about why I left studying urban planning at an ivy league university to do what I'm doing now. But I've been thriving in my personal life more than ever since I left and I feel lucky to have made that decision when I did. Making major alterations to college plans is not a comfortable or easy thing to consider, but reading accounts like these reminds me of the importance of saying that taking a break is okay, changing course is okay, and it's important to intervene when something is wrecking your life. I wish I could go back in time and tell you to take this semester off and be with your family to refresh yourself instead of being at school.",

Cornell is an amazing institute and only the fact that you attended such a good university will have a long lasting impact on your career and life. But the prestige of Cornell comes with a lot of challenges and moments of disappointment - it is normal. In times Like these, you should ONLY keep the good parts of the story and think about what you are grateful for and not what you\u2019re not. You have to be able to push through because there is ALWAYS light in the end of the tunnel. Just to touch the grades matter, it\u2019s not the only thing that matters for your career - it\u2019s who YOU are and you should try to never lose yourself. Grades is a bonus point similarly with the fact that Cornell is a bonus point for your life-  grades are not determining your career And I have seen multiple people in high places with low GPAs and not from ivy leagues - you already have a competitive advantage against them only by attending Cornell. The fact that you\u2019re being challenged means you\u2019re pushing yourself and that\u2019s the only way to evolve - I\u2019m sure you could get A\u2019s in every class from a low profile university but the quality of knowledge is incomparable really. The only advise I wanted to give you is that you have to push through until you see the light and no matter what you change in your life, try to keep who you are.",

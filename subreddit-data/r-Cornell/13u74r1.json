    "postText": "Anyone travelling to Syracuse on 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, or possibly 6/1? \n\nI haven't bought tickets but am planning to be on a train there which departs at 11:42 AM, or 9:51 AM. \n\nTaking ourbus would supposedly get me to Syracuse at 11:20 AM. But the walk, according to google, from the bus drop off to the train is ~15 mins, which leaves very little room for error. Since I've had issues with ourbus being late before, I don't want to take that risk if I can help it.\n\nIf anyone is driving to Syracuse on the morning on amy of those days, I would be willing to pay like $30 for a ride. \n\nOr if anyone is planning to take an Uber at an equivalent time, I would be up to split the cost (roughly $90), since it's hard to justify it paying the full price myself.\n\nOr if anyone knows of another alternative that exists.",

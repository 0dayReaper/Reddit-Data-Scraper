            "comment": "To the NJ side:\n\nIt looks like the fastest way is to take NJ Transit NJCL line to Secaucus Junction, then take another line (PASC) to Anderson St. Station in Hackensack, then the 175 bus to the GW bridge. This takes 1 hour to 1.25 hours based on bus schedule timing.\n\nTo the NY side: \n\nTake NJ transit to Penn Station, and the A train to the GW bridge. This takes about the same amount of time. \n\nThere are more places to wait on the NY side, so it\u2019s probably better to get on there, although it might be somewhat annoying to take all of your luggage on the subway. Given that you land at 2, assuming that everything is on time, you\u2019ll probably have at least an hour to spare.",

However, note that, depending when and where you\u2019re flying from, it might not be that much more expensive to fly directly to Ithaca. \n\nFor example, on Monday, June 12, it\u2019s only $50 more to fly LAX-EWR-ITH than LAX-EWR. Of course, this isn\u2019t the case if you\u2019re flying for graduation.",

I assume I just follow the signs for line A, but where do I buy a ticket?",

The NJ Transit takes you right to Penn Station, from where you walk west (to eighth avenue) towards the A-train. You\u2019ll see plenty of signs.\n\nTake the A-train north. Expresses are faster.

    "postText": "I\u2019m in InfoSci and on track to finish all of my degree requirements by the end of junior year, besides some credits, so in theory completing the MEng without even graduating any later than I otherwise would have is feasible. I did talk with the MEng advisor but there are a few questions that would be better answered by people who have actually done the program:\n\nI know that need-based grants aren\u2019t provided, and that the most anyone can get from need alone is loans. And I know that merit/URM basis financial aid is available for students to apply for. What I want to know is, how realistically difficult would it be to get fin aid/scholarship funding for the program? I\u2019m on substantial financial aid as a low income family student, and it\u2019s not really feasible for me to pay full charge for a semester that could be spent as a fin aid covered undergrad.\n\nAnd is a CS MEng worth it for an InfoSci student? Most assessments on this sub talk about the opportunity cost of an extra semester, but I think I\u2019m in a situation where I could theoretically finish my studies here in a bit under the usual 8 semesters but know I don\u2019t want to, so at the end of the day I\u2019ll graduate the same time either way.\n\nI know that there exists an unfortunate stigma around InfoSci, and that resumes sometimes get filtered purely for their listed degree name, but I also know plenty find success with an IS degree. I\u2019m just unsure how much harder my life would be, since CS career spaces online flip flop between making it sound like degree name is trivial and making it sound like they\u2019d throw away a resume from a non CS major if it came from mf Linus Torvalds. If using my free year for a CS MEng isnt the best idea, what would be a good alternative use of it?",

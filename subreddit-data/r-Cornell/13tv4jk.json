Think about this first. Perhaps you want to take BIOG1445, the auto tutorial version, in the future if you think it will work better for you. Either way, doing things like attending office hours, attending every lecture, asking the professors questions, studying well in advance for exams, etc. should be helpful.",

The content from the course can be learned on your own in the future for the MCAT. If you don\u2019t think you have the discipline to teach yourself the content then I\u2019d do what the other commenter suggested and take 1445. Again that\u2019s just my opinion.",

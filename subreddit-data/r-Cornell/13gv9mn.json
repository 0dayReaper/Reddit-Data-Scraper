    "postText": " \n\nHey everyone!\n\n I have an internship at an INGO for the summer and I am looking for places to sublet in the City. I need to sublet a furnished place from June 1st to July 31st. Anywhere within 45 minutes to 1-hour commute of Turtle Bay, Manhattan is ideal for me. My budget is $1000-$1100. I will appreciate any leads.\n\nThank you so much!",

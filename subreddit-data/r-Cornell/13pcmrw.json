Or, you get put somewhere like Donlon where you are given neither AC nor any installed lighting. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nWhenever you get your housing assignment, just go to the search bar and look for details about the dorm. 99% of the time, people have already asked, and the answer will already be there for you.",

Saw a ton of this at the end of this semester. It's just so much unnecessary waste and it makes move-out so much more of a hassle than it already is.\n\nSave your money and just wait to see what is actually essential for your needs. There's also a Dump and Run (event with students' donated goods that happens at the beginning of the semester) where you can also pick up items too.",

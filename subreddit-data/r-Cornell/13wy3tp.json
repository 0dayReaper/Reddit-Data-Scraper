    "postText": "Hey! I am currently a rising soph majoring in ORIE. Unfortunately, I was unable to secure an internship for this summer. I would appreciate it if upperclassmen and alumni would be kind enough to share their summer and academic term experiences with me.\n\nAs I am a bit lost on where to go with this major. Possible routes have been to double major in CS,  go into machine learning, consulting, or the healthcare field.\n\nAdditionally, I am curious to know where this major can take me and what skills I need to develop for an internship or research in this field. Thank you to anyone who replies!!\n\nAnd please let me know if I can PM you to further inquire about the major, internships, and other questions if you are an ORIE or CS major!",

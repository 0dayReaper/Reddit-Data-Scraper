    "postText": "I got a waitlist from Cornell. Optimistic of the conversion. What's the class diversity like and what was your best experience?\n\nI'm already doing a masters in a non-ivy league school and spent a fortune as an international student. Are there any ways for me to pay for the tuition apart from loans (already in 90k debt. Bank won't give me more) ? What's the likelihood of scholarship and how to increase my chances ?\n\nWhat was your experience with studio?\nWould you pursue the course and live through the experience if you were to do it again ?",

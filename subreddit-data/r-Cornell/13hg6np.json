    "postText": "I went on a walk off campus this morning around 11am and a turquoise car (I think the model is a mini cooper convertible) was driving by but slowed down as he approached me on E Lincoln St. He had his roof down so I could see he was a white male with grey hair approximately in his 50s-60s. He was wearing a blue polo and white shorts and had sunglasses on. I thought not too much about it but after turning onto N Cayuga St, I spotted his car again as I was approaching the intersection at W Marshall St. I was heading towards Gimme Coffee so I crossed the sidewalk after he drove by. He turned into the Fall Creek Dentistry parking and saw that I was crossing the street to the other sidewalk and turned back around. I started freaking out but I thought I\u2019d be safe if I went into Gimme Coffee because it was packed. He realized I was going to Gimme Coffee and drove into the parking lot next to Kinney Pharmacy. He got out and started walking across the street towards me.  He made visible eye contact with me and started making his way into the cafe and got in the line. I knew better and quickly walked away down Cascadilla Ave. At this point, I felt slightly relieved and picked up my pace so he wouldn\u2019t know which way I went. I turned back after walking a safe distance and didn\u2019t see anyone. But I did a double take just to be safe and saw him walking out of Gimme Coffee and looking around until I saw him look at me. He started walking towards me and I was terrified. I start panicking and running without looking back. I keep running and running until I finally turned around and saw that I lost him. \n\nI never have I been this afraid in my life. I know I should have tried to take a photo of him or the car to help others better identify him and avoid him, but I\u2019ve never been followed. In the moment I was so afraid I just wanted to make it back to campus and my place safely. I am extremely paranoid now and will never be going off campus alone. Please be safe if you\u2019re off campus, even if it\u2019s in the daytime.",

Additionally, do not be afraid to phone the police, as well as let the stalker know that too, and try to catch the license plate as well. Glad you are okay!",

In the moment, I was considering asking the workers for help or anyone nearby but the cafe is extremely small and he was basically at the entrance since the line was almost out the door. I didn\u2019t want to be within a few feet near him because I didn\u2019t want to have any interaction with him. He wasn\u2019t afraid of following me in broad daylight with people and children walking near me so I was scared what he might say or do if he had the chance to do so. I was also scared he would just wait outside and follow me after and I was trying to think quickly.",

This happened at night when I was walking on Lake Ave (a couple blocks north from Gimme Coffee). I had stopped at the crossing when I saw a black car approaching. He stopped as well. I paused to see if he wanted to turn, he didn\u2019t so I started crossing the road. Half way through he came at me. I jumped back, he braked, glared at me and sped away. I was SO scared I ran from there cause I was terrified that he\u2019d turn the block and come back. I couldn\u2019t even see the plates because it happened so fast and it was a literal \u201cdeer caught in the headlights moment\u201d at the time. I cried all the way home because this has never happened to me and I felt so scared and sad. I\u2019m an international student and I don\u2019t know if it was racial but I\u2019ve been terrified to walk on the streets and cross roads ever since. Every time I see a black car my heart just beats so fast and I relive that entire experience. Why did he have to be so cruel and do that? I feel so sad, angry and scared nowadays.",

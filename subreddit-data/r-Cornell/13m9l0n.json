            "comment": "According to an [Ithaca placenames](https://tompkinscountyny.gov/files2/historian/placenames/kammen%20chap%2008.pdf) appendix by Jane Marsh Dieckmann:\n\n&gt;**Cascadilla Creek**, one of Ithaca\u2019s chief waterways, may have a name of Indian origin, similar in formation to Unadilla in Broome County. Possibly too, the word could have come from a combination of \u201ccascade\u201d and \u201cdell,\u201d which then reverted to Cascadilla, or from Spanish, meaning little cascades.  \n\nThe suffix \"-illa\" is also a Latin suffix that forms a diminutive noun from an adjective, so it could be that as well.\n\nUltimately, however, it is a name, and a name is pronounced however it is pronounced, without regard to origin. Detroit is pronounced /d\u026atr\u0254\u026at/, even though it's French, and in French it would be /det\u0281wa/ . For that matter, the pronunciation of plenty of English placenames cannot be intuited from their spellings, like Leicester, Newfoundland, or Beaconsfield.",

At what point are you like: \u201cokay maybe grad school isn\u2019t for me\u201d versus \u201cgetting into here was actually an accomplishment\u201d etc. Also please expand on whether you\u2019re considering overall rank, discipline rank, or sub discipline rank mostly. For example UCSB is a monster at theoretical physics but ok overall.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/14625bs)",

So as long as there's one good professor who does what you want to explore and you can work with them then a school can provide you a quality PhD. Prestige doesn't determine success, it just makes it a little less work.",

At the Ph.D. level, you should have one or two PI\u2019s that you want to work with, and who want to work with you (I made the mistake of not doing this.) I\u2019d also strongly recommend avoiding places that don\u2019t cover your tuition.",

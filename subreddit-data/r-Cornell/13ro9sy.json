    "postText": "Hi! I'm a rising sophomore and I want to take some case exams in the fall. \n\nThe whole situation with math 1910 is kind of dumb--I'm trying to transfer into engineering from cals and I got a 4 on the calc BC exam which allowed me to take 1920 last semester (in cals), but now I have to take 1910 since I needed a 5 on the AP to test out of 1910 in engineering (even though I already passed 1920 \ud83d\ude44).\n\nPhys 2213 I just want to case bc I really don't want to take the class.\n\nAre there any resources that y'all find helpful other than practice tests? Most stuff I found online is a twinge outdated so not sure if anything has changed.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks!",

            "comment": "PHYS 2213 was a really easy CASE exam compared to the difficulty of the class. Best decision I made was to self-study and place out. Granted, I took AP Physics 2 so I wasn\u2019t going in completely inexperienced with EM. I imagine it\u2019d be very difficult to do if it was all new content. \n\nJust take a bunch of AP Physics C: EM practice tests, the content almost exactly matches up since that\u2019s what it\u2019s meant to replace. Grab a textbook for reference on some stuff and you\u2019ll be fine. There are some excellent online review guides with like every AP C exam free response ever given back to the 60s, that was a godsend",

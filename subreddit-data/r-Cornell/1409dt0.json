    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a junior transfer that was admitted to Cornell!! :)) I'm wondering if anyone can help me figure out housing. I haven't committed yet because I haven't received my financial aid package yet. But I'm very keen on committing! If anyone can offer some advice on housing, it would really mean a lot to me. I really want to get on-campus housing, but I heard that it's pretty hard for upperclassmen. I also heard of applying to program houses. Does anyone know the acceptance rates of these program houses? I'm pretty lost !! :(. I know that considering off-campus housing is a must, but I'm pretty worried  because I'm out of state, so  bringing a car isn't an option. I'm assuming that I'll need to walk to most places, and I'm a bit concerned about doing that especially in the winter.   \nSorry if I seem scatter-brained-- I'm just really lost!! Does anyone have any advice? Thank you so much!!",

            "comment": "To answer part of your question: you will have to walk a lot no matter if you live on or off campus but its bearable with the right clothes and shoes. Also its pretty late in the game to find good off campus housing starting in the fall, so transfer housing on campus is probably your best best. I dont know that much about it but have heard that many transfers are put in the gothics, which are far from being the best housing out these but it gets the job done",

The program houses acceptance rate seems to be *extremely* lax -- some may require you to respond to a prompt related to that house specifically but I haven't met anyone who got rejected. \n\nPM me if you have any questions!",

    "postText": "Starbucks is literally \u2728union-busting\u2728 and shutting down the COLLEGE AVE STARBUCKS. This store is high-volume and has nothing to do with revenue/customers. Not only that, but management has avoided saying whether the workers (the ones that unionized!) will be relocated to a different location. Of course, they did this when students are gone for the summer so not many students can physically help protest, but please help this gain traction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/viqo0zfehn391.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f6840bba5d8daa940b081483018c5ca5e9ef555c",

            "comment": "Probably going to be an unpopular take, but I wish somebody that was a part of this strike initiative to be more vocal and provide alot more visual evidence regarding the extent of the perceived damage of the grease trap. It's really hard to believe that this issue, coupled with general disgruntlement, would really justify a strike. Rather simply notifying a local authorities regarding food safety, or OSHA guidelines seems like that would be a good place to start without going nuclear. That said, it's unclear to what lengths they have gone to solve this issue.\n\nPrincipally, the role of a union is not to wrest power and control from a company for its own sake, but provide an avenue in which employees under its umbrella feel as though they have negotiating agency and a well established line of communication. The problem is if you demonstrate that your union is willing to stop working on a dime and go nuclear for things that might not merit such a response, the company isn't exactly going to be inclined to continue that line of communication. Moreover, we know that this particular Starbucks makes most of its money at two different segments of time in the year, each lasting for 4.5 months. Deciding to impact the most lucrative month (after already having been impacted by covid restrictions) of the first 4.5 months of this year does not bode well in the corporate cost/benefit analysis of maintaining the property. Moreover, we have no idea what the property value/rental costs and operating costs on that Starbucks are... nevermind that a huge competitor (CTB) is closer in proximity to campus and is alot more popular. It's also unclear how the taxing works.\n\n Bottom line, It's a bit disingenuous, I think, to shout union busting when there are many factors that go into this issue and alot of the details aren't freely available. This isn't in defense of Starbucks per se, but apprehension that a company would simply shut its property down because they don't want to fix a grease trap. There has to be more details.",

You don\u2019t think that anti-union Starbucks would shut down a location to make an example? Regardless, with the margins that Starbucks makes on those drinks (50 cents for a little bit of oat milk\u2026) and the volume of orders that they get from Cornell students in Ctown, even with a union there is no way that that Starbucks is going under. I think you lack a sense of the bigger picture here. There are definitely reasons that Starbucks would shut down beyond a pure cost benefit analysis",

I don't know Starbucks's position on unions. \n\nWhat I do know is that I (hopefully) am a reasonable person who falls into an educated group of people, who has a particular outlook on things. That outlook is a similar one to many: detached from this problem. Im merely speaking to what i would expect, just like many others would expect as well, as somebody who does not have a lot of impetus to be informed.\n\nI'm a molecular biology major, I don't follow this. This issue does not fit into my sphere of interest of things that I would pursue independently... and I'm not the only one who is like this. Thus if I express that a particular issue doesn't appear intuitive, the goal shouldn't be to talk me down, but perhaps inform me or onlookers. \n\nAside from all of that, nothing I've said has actually been refuted. The closest thing to refuting what I've said is your statement regarding margins that Starbucks makes x y and z, vs what they pay.... but we don't know that do we? We done have the numbers... if we do that would be an important thing to share. Everything that I've been told so far revolves around what people think happens, and what somebody said something looks like.  So a reasonable person who is apprehensive about such things is berated by various people on an online forum because they want something more concrete to hold onto? Where that more concrete thing to hold onto would be an avenue for not just me but for other people to use as a reason to support this initiative?\n\nThis whole thread is disappointing to me...",

Its not simply that i am uneducated about the nature of starbuck's attitude towards unionizing and how that affects the particularities here in ithaca (a pretty esoteric thing to be aware of, certainly if one finds themself in stem). Thats not to say these things are mutually exclusive, i may be uneducated as well... but thats not the point.\n\nWhat i am doing is speaking to things in a way that a reasonable person might be skeptical of a given assertion. This does not mean that i am saying what IS.... rather that i cant but sure that what another says IS. I am not claiming anybody is wrong btw... i have been asking for something concrete all throughout this thread.\n\nI dont even plan on being pedantic about a very vague figure... all i would want is something specific regarding this starbucks and how it interfaces with what is currently being seen. An employee in the know could probably do a bit of legwork and have gotten some info from the manager well before this blew up regarding revenue and pricing and blah blah blah. My point is that nobody is producing these things, and yet people feel super comfortable about shouting union busting.\n\nYoure right, i have no way to know i represent the majority opinion... just a strong inkling given what we know about public sentiment in general. Never mind that if i didn't represent the majority opinion, the corollary would be that more than half of the Cornell student body is aware of, is educated in the intricacies of, and supportive of this issue regarding the college town Starbucks. Now if you're going to make that claim, then idk what do do after that. \n\nRegardless, its a relatively intuitive idea, I think, to suppose that supporters who are passionate about a given issue are a lot more vocal than people who are unaware of said issue. Thus, while it may appear to be very popular issue, the majority opinion is unclear. One way to show this would be just looking at the last presidential election, where more people voted than ever before... yet that amounted to 40% of the country. That 40% was very polarized and loud, but certainly the majority of the country wasn't compelled enough to act. \n\nAgain, please look, in good faith, at what I am saying without addressing some construct of what I appear to be because i skeptical or in opposition to a given viewset. I am merely voicing my opinion and looking to BE informed, and being as cordial as possible while being berated by various people for doing so.",

How does regular Cornell student who can get coffee from 8 other places have any reason to look into this issue unless they are shown the issue.\n\nThis whole tangent isn't even relevant to the problem at hand, because I'm simply evidencing why the average person wont have it in there purview to take action about this particular thing out of thin air. My whole thing is hoping to find a solid piece of \"this is what is happening and here is proof why Starbucks is just trash\" and nothing I've been shown says that.\n\nEdit: this will be my last reply on this thread.

I highly doubt that location has anything even remotely close to net losses, so even with whatever the union wrangles it's very unlikely that that location will be anything but a regular net gain. As for the option of using the resources to open a location elsewhere, that could be the case, but again, I doubt that long-term the gains of where ever the resources of this closed location go will make more than this location. There are multiple SBUX locations in smaller and/or less rich college towns across the US (e.g. Normal, IL and DeKalb, IL) that have maintained their locations. If the choice isn't due to the net the location is making, then it's just a clear case of SBUX corporate bringing down the anti-labor hammer, possibly at their own expense.",

            "comment": "Context on the closure:\n\nBack in early April, we won the entirety of Ithaca for the union in a landslide vote. At College Ave in particular, it was 19-1. One of the main reasons for our decision to organize back in the fall was the November bomb threat, where our manager at the time forced us to reopen because it was \"JUST a bomb threat,\" not an active shooter threat (verbatim, isn't that awful?). Therefore, we unionized to have a say over the policies in our store, like for safety.\n\nIn mid/late April, we went on strike. There is a grease trap in our store (we don't even use grease at Starbucks, the trap hasn't been maintained in years) that overflowed, spreading old grease and wastewater all over the ground. We were expected to clean it with mops and rags (a clear OSHA violation to force workers to do that). My shift supervisor got permission from the workers on at the time for them to walk out, and he told customers to leave due to a wastewater incident, locked the doors, and they went on strike! We were on strike for an entire day before Starbucks temporarily fixed the grease trap and cleaned it with the alleged intent to replace it eventually.\n\nHowever, on June 3rd, Starbucks management told workers that our store would be closing on June 10th with less than a week's notice to find new jobs or know whether or not we would get to keep our jobs and just relocate. They specifically cited the grease trap as a reason why our store is closing, which implies that they would rather close our store completely than meet the demands of our strike. They also cited \"time and attendance\" issues, which only came about because they halved the store's hours so that much of the bargaining unit, especially closers, were unable to work full shifts and had to give up their hours.\n\nThis is illegal and retaliation for union organization, through and through. I don't know how else to explain it, there is convincing and damning evidence that there is no economic reason to permanently close a store with extremely high traffic during the school year. It's outrageous. There are more benefits than burdens to keeping the store open and negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with my store, but Starbucks would rather use us as an example of \"what happens when workers try to stand up.\"\n\nThe NLRB has been made aware by our lawyers. We will continue to fight for our store to be reopened and its workers reinstated. However, this could take several months. Expect occasional updates on the matter.",

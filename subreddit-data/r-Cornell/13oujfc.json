I\u2019m a junior trying to going into some type of finance and I know it\u2019s pretty important to have an internship this summer, but I\u2019m at the end of the road. \n\nWould it make sense to reach out to some professors to try and get some experience or does anyone any that may be looking for someone to help?",

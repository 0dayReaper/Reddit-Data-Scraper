Therefore, technically you have to be able to enrolled in that course (but they will do that for you). As the other commenter points out, you need to fill out the Summer 2023 Checklist though (link available when you click to find out the hold details).",

I just clicked on the link and filled out the summer checklist (like previous checklists, took like 2 minutes) and my hold was removed. I don't think it'll affect anything, but can't hurt to complete it and it's super quick.",

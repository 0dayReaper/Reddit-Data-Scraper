    "postText": "Heard that they\u2019re the largest frat at Cornell- something like 1,000+ actives? Heard the hazing process is kinda whack though. So crazy that some schools are trying to shut their chapters down. Something about self isolating for 10 days and having to do your finals as well? Also apparently they like to stick stuff up your noses once a week, kinda weird if you ask me. If any of the current brothers could give more info on the frat I\u2019d appreciate it!",

    "postText": "From the fact that people got in here we know they have to be geeks. Yet 90% of the people do not seem that way.\n\nIs everyone just pretending not to be interested in stuff? why? Is this the norm even at HYPSM if you know?\n\nI think this might be the root of any of my hardships here since I had difficulty building a picture of how committed I should be. Because everyone else j seemed to be chilling, and while looking at something I may find out they're part of research and clubs and that naturally makes you feel like a fool.",

            "comment": "Don't use other students' interest levels to gauge how intense your interest levels should be. Go after the experiences here that actually interest you, and you'll find the people who share your interests and passions. \n\nThere are many things that Cornell students may be struggling with that can mask as disinterest. Here are just a few:\n\nSome people at Cornell were already burned out when they arrived, having worked so hard to be the type of student that gets into highly selective institutions. \n\nSome of them are adjusting to the environment at Cornell (intensity of classes, weather, etc.). \n\nSome are adjusting to being far from home. Some are adjusting to being amongst incredibly stellar peers and, as a result,  are dealing with imposter syndrome. \n\nSome are dealing with depression and anxiety. \n\nSome are still figuring out what they want to study and do for careers, and due to the fact that the options at Cornell are almost unlimited, they may be finding it very difficult to narrow those choices down. \n\nSome of them are fighting to form their own identities apart from the pressure of their parents' dreams and expectations. \n\nSome are lonely because they haven't found their people here yet, which can cause anyone to disconnect from their institutions.\n\nAt any rate, be grateful if you are here and not struggling such that you are able to be clear-headed,  excited, and energetic enough to hold on to your passions and act on them. I believe most every student at Cornell has many deeply held interests, and I wish them all the best possible experience here that will allow them to be healthy and joyful enough that they will be able to access the opportunities here to indulge those passions and follow them to incredible outcomes.\n.",

            "comment": "The fact that you find everyone as not interested and chill is perhaps a testament to how competitive the Cornell culture is. Many refrain from talking about what courses their taking, how many clubs they\u2019re in, what kind of research they\u2019re doing, internships, jobs they\u2019ve done or currently taking on, etc, so on a surface level they appear chill, and then suddenly you connect with them on LinkedIn and you see all of their leadership positions, research projects, internships, and skillsets they\u2019ve developed since the age of 13. And then you start comparing yourself to them and think you\u2019re not doing enough so you don\u2019t do that again and choose to be quiet about the stuff you\u2019re involved in to avoid this kind of discussion with others because you don\u2019t want to hear what they\u2019re doing and how little sleep they\u2019re getting because you don\u2019t want to compare yourself to them and feel like you\u2019re not doing enough despite functioning at your maximum capacity. So now you appear chill in the eyes of others but deep down the iceberg you are also suffering.",

Perhaps you may have just not exactly found your people on campus to vibe with in similar interests, which is not to say to disconnect from your current relationships with people totally. You'll figure it out, and if not there is a whole network to reach out to for some help :)",

There are lots of kids raised with every advantage who are good at taking tests, but who are content to study a topic they don\u2019t care much about in exchange for a continuing comfortable life.\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s true about many passionate people is that they have more than one passion. I have fiber arts friends that are also passionate gardeners, martial arts friends that are also musicians, and science friends that are also dancers. Knowing them in one context doesn\u2019t mean knowing them in all.\n\nLastly, most folks learn early that not everyone wants to talk about their special interest. They may not be aiming for \u201ccool\u201d, just \u201cpolite\u201d. To address your larger question, you should work as hard as you need to learn what you want to learn. Learning to assess your life by your own standards is a huuuuge part of becoming an adult.",

    "postText": "Since coming to Cornell from my decently small public school in the southeastern US, I have become increasingly aware, annoyed, and alarmed by the vast amount of elitism and privilege that goes unchecked here at Cornell. As a Government major, I also think that I've had a front seat to the many sociopolitical and socioeconomic misunderstandings that inhabit the thought processes of so many of my friends and fellow students. To be clear, I understand that this is a moot point to a lot of people and that many of the very people I am indirectly talking about are reading this. Still, I need to fucking vent about this.\n\nLet\u2019s just start with my first interaction at Cornell! I logged onto the first class of my college education on Zoom: an 8 am seminar-styled humanities class that I was beyond excited for. I had this awesome idea that it would be an introduction to the rigorous academic debate and exchange of ideas from different points of view that I would have to look forward to for the next four years. That was a funny thought. We started doing icebreakers, typical stuff like your hometown, pronouns, major, and name. Finally, it's my turn. I say I'm from \\*insert Southern state/region and city here\\*. Almost immediately, a fellow student unmutes themself and asks me, \"Do you guys wear shoes where you're from, or have you guys not got there, yet?\" leading to visible laughter in the boxes across my screen and only a semi-annoyed \"okay, sorry, let's keep going\" from the instructor. Wow. What a great way to start my college experience.\n\nNow, understand this, I've got thick skin and I've heard a lot shitty things that are way worse, so it didn't really bother me. However, it made me keenly aware of what sort of response my background would receive and just how genuinely middle-class people are viewed by others at Cornell.\u00a0\n\nI've been astounded by so many aspects of the past two years of my education. Some of the statements that have been uttered in my government classes regarding socioeconomic marginalization, of course by someone wearing a brand new, $7,000 Moncler jacket, would be better and more kindly said by saying, \u201cstop being poor, idiots.\u201d I\u2019ve also heard so many different punitive, elitist arguments regarding the southeastern US, my home, that I genuinely feel like I\u2019m the star of a Comedy Central roast sometimes. Statements like, \u201cJust listen to how they speak, you can tell that they\u2019re stupid!\u201d or, \u201cWhy do we even care what happens down there? They voted for Trump, they deserve to suffer!\u201d have become so persistent and constant to my damn ears that I\u2019ve just stopped trying to explain how fucked up they are.\n\nRegarding politics specifically, the level of strictly performative activism that so many here at Cornell participate in and think is adequate is quite astounding. Quick newsflash: screenshotting an Instagram post and putting it on your Snapchat story is not helping anyone. I really cannot think of a better example of this than the Gan\u0119dag\u01eb acknowledgment that we see at the end of \u2018woke\u2019 students\u2019 emails, university correspondence, and so on. Is it nice to see that? Sure. Does it help heal the deep wounds that institutions like Cornell have wrought for decades? Hell no. See, some of y\u2019all just don\u2019t understand that acknowledgments and building-naming are only step one with issues like that. It might be history to those of you who shop at Chanel with Mommy and Daddy\u2019s money, but it\u2019s very real and very apparent for some of us.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking of institutional inadequacies in regards to socioeconomic status, let\u2019s talk about Cornell and Financial Aid! If you don\u2019t remember, last semester, a decent chunk of the student population that relies upon need-based financial aid to even think of going here didn\u2019t receive their aid packages until October, or, in worse cases, November. If you\u2019re part of the around fifty percent of the student population that does not rely upon assistance from the University, please try to understand the massive amount of stress that so many had to deal with, entirely unnecessarily. Having a hold on your account and dealing with hopefully empty threats of being put on probation/unenrolled for the Spring semester while also dealing with the shitty day-to-day worries of being a college student at one of the most difficult academic institutions in the world can be a little bit taxing.\n\nBeing one of these people, I arranged a meeting with one of the lovely Financial Aid counselors to discuss my Financial Aid package, as well as my options for living off-campus the following year. It would\u2019ve probably been more beneficial to ask this subreddit for advice. After getting nowhere with the status of my aid package, I asked how financial aid operates for students living off-campus and what I should expect my cost of attendance to be. I didn\u2019t get an answer. Instead, the counselor asked me what apartment I was looking at. I showed them the property, the cheapest Collegetown apartment I could find at that time, only to be told that I should probably look for something \u201cmore within my means.\u201d They continued this thought and told me that my financial profile indicated I was a \u201chigh-need\u201d student and that if I wanted an apartment like that, I would have to take out a considerable amount of loans because Cornell would not help. I would later find out that this was wholly false and that Cornell would indeed help, which was undoubtedly a great revelation, but the fact that I wasn\u2019t told that by someone that worked in that very office was quite upsetting. My theory is that when fifty percent of the student population can afford to go here with no financial assistance, what seems helpful to someone in actual need can seem relatively adequate while truthfully not being sufficient in the slightest.\n\nFinally, can we just mention how fucking ridiculous clubs are here? If you join \u2018extracurriculars\u2019 here, you should get a medal, as well as three additional credits to your graduation requirements because you are legitimately taking on so many useless, unnecessary responsibilities for little payoff. Past that, the process of getting into these clubs is equally as corrupt and tilted towards the advantage of elitists as the collegiate admissions process is, if not more.\u00a0\n\nListen, I am not making this post to get pity from strangers on the internet or anything like that. For one, so many people struggle with these dynamics, just as I am. Pity for me will do nothing for them. Secondly, I don\u2019t want pity in the slightest; I want change. I would prefer structural, institutional change, but we all know that\u2019s not going to happen. In lieu of that, I would settle for understanding from the privileged elitists that refuse to think about \u2018how the other half lives. There are too many people here that so obviously do not realize how privileged they are to be here. There are too many people here who very clearly did not get in here on their own merits but, instead, they are here for the potential donations that the University could elicit from their guardian. Damn, there are too many people here that are only here because their parents went here or somewhere similar!\u00a0\n\nCornell was founded on the progressive, meritocratic principle of \u201cany person, any study.\u201d A lot of us had to write a whole fucking essay on it to get admitted. It\u2019s a great slogan, but it is simply not true for too many. I wonder way too often what my life would have been like if I didn\u2019t go somewhere so targeted to privilege and elitism. The daily microaggressions and annoyances just pile up so high that I truly do not feel welcome nor meant to be here. As I walk the Arts Quad every day, I continuously feel like an outsider, surrounded by so many that have no definition as to what it even means to be an outsider. I have to remind myself, even now after years of being here, that I fucking worked my ass off to be here; that I deserve to be here. It\u2019s pretty demoralizing that I have to do that so much, but it keeps me going. I know there are a lot of people out there that feel similarly, and I just want y\u2019all to know that you\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not lesser than others. You belong here just as much as anyone else that put in the work to call this place home. Keep your head down, keep working, and maybe one day we can make things a bit better.\n\nTo be clear, I am not trying to demonize anyone that has been blessed with a more fortunate upbringing. All I am saying is that the way things are now blatantly favors y\u2019all while simultaneously making things harder for people that are struggling. This is a systemic/social argument, not a personal one.\u00a0\n\nIf you made it to the end of this rant, congratulations! I barely did myself. I truly hope this was eye-opening, thought-provoking, or it at least causes you to ask yourself some questions.",

It's annoying, yet unsurprising as Cornell is a top 1% university, which means that it also invites some of the most privileged assholes in existence.",

The tax code has evolved quite literally AROUND this system of how tax revenues can be generated. There is really no way that taxable entities could occupy Cornell\u2019s and IC\u2019s footprints and generate more benefit for Ithaca. The economic activity created by educational institutions generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenues in employment tax, income tax, sales tax, residential property tax, hotel tax, fuel tax\u2026and this list is without really trying.\n\nWhat is relatively new is the massive endowment wealth of many of these institutions. Why those endowments should enjoy the same tax status as, say, pension funds that provide for citizens\u2019 (taxable) retirement income is far less clear. We might someday see a tax levied on distributions for endowments over certain sizes, which would be politically attractive and not exactly unfair. Some cynics believe that the massive push on campuses for diversity, equity, and inclusion is an attempt to head off efforts to increase endowment taxation. Those cynics note that the fervor of those efforts correlates quite closely to endowment size.\n\nTo the OP. I would offer the following:\n- taste and privilege are unrelated, at Cornell and in the rest of life. This is not a new phenomenon although you may only now be recognizing it.\n- remember this as you progress through your own journey, which may in fact be enhanced by the privilege earned from having graduated from a competitive institution.\n- you were being engaged by the tactless metrocentric perpetrator of the first-day Zoom icebreaker in an age-old social tussle between city folk and country folk. You will need to develop a witty standard riposte to shut down these comments, such as \u201cno, we didn\u2019t have shoes a lot of the time.

Ithaca itself is somewhat hostile to cars, and so locals are in a bind in terms of getting to their jobs. And even when jobs adjust pay for cost of living, the progressive tax system and eligibility for federal aid do not.\n\nAlso, pretty sure the LIRR folk here got pissy and downvoted you, lol.",

I was lucky to get a great financial aid package upon admission, which gave me a false sense that Cornell would be very accommodating. \n\nThe fact that financial aid was distributed so late is quite honestly unforgivable and completely soured my perception of the university as an institution. My family went through drastic employment changes last year that shifted income considerably. With the opaque method of calculating financial need, I was unsure of how my family would be affected for way longer than necessary. \n\nAlso, things on campus are just so expensive in general. From meal plans, to PE classes, to gym fees. It\u2019s insane. Sometimes I just sit back in awe as people pay for these things without any hesitation or concern. When I was forced to have a meal plan for on campus living, I rationed our swipes and BRBs strategically since the thought of wasting a 15 dollar meal I paid for because it expired after a week stressed me out so much. \n\nIn general, I find that people here are very unaware of how the majority of people in US from non-wealthy backgrounds live day-to-day, and how stressful it can be as one of those students.

My experience at Cornell made me painfully aware that I wasn't socialized for this type of environment at all.\n\nIt feels like there are performative activists everywhere at this school, and it's exhausting to continuously hear our experiences be reduced to talking points for class debates and group assignments because there isn't a space to disengage for an extended period of time. Especially when the talking points are blatantly wrong or overlook the nuances and facets of these experiences.\n\nI honestly don't have a good time interacting with most other students either because our experiences are so different: It is hard to have engaging conversations when you're consistently being probed and prodded about my existence. And I don't know... I also feel like there's a gap in maturity between students who aren't privileged and students who are because we've had to be more vigilant growing up and take on greater burden/responsibilities that have more significant consequences which makes maintaining relationships very difficult. Obviously, like you said, this isn't anyone's fault. But I don't think people are aware of how inconsiderate or selfish certain things can be.\n\nYour comment on clubs is very relatable as well and isn't talked about enough imo. The clubs that I joined here aren't inviting at all: It feels like being part of a business, even some of the social ones. There is a major lack the community in these spaces (which I brought up to these E-Boards before; they looked bewildered about the idea of fostering community!), and consistent pressure on members to produce content often on tight turnaround times. I ended up quiting all of the clubs I was involved in the start of my 3rd year because they made me feel drained and unhappy which sucked because I really enjoy these areas.\n\nLate financial aid at this point is a genuine attempt to trap low-income students into taking out loans and there's no way around this.\n\nOverall, I'm sorry that this has been your experience at Cornell. I surround myself with a lot of people who aren't as privileged as the average student, and these are very common criticisms if it helps. I also appreciate this post because I think this is a pretty big issue but gets overlooked because we don't matter to other students or the school.",

Somebody had linked material related to that project on this sub and it was astounding how much they don't teach in the History of Cornell course.\n\nMy previous position had been limited to the land at Cornell's current campuses. For anyone reading this who's unaware, most of the region was part of the Central NY Military Tract, and was given by treaty after the defeat of pro-British Haudenosaunee in the US War for Independence, and these nations had been militarily important regional players for the Dutch, French, and British colonial empires for over a century, and were familiar with European land and treaty practices. I thought (and still think) that painting them as strictly victims needlessly infantilizes them. However, that treaty was violated on multiple accounts by the State of New York, and the linked project delves into that.\n\nAdditionally, my limited perspective blinded me to how much Cornell's founding relied on western expansion and the aggressive conquest of various peoples or breaking of treaties. This project is an excellent idea, and I am grateful to the woke Cornellians on this sub for presenting well-sourced articles and statements to show me how limited my perspective had been.",

Most people just buy them because it's a functional luxury utility jacket with a lifetime warranty. Gonna say this yet again but most of this reads like a reactionary tantrum against people with some money. Most people who own a jacket like this wouldn't even be considered \"rich\" in the strict, statistical sense of the word. This entire argument would've been way more constructive and insightful if it didn't generalize and project so much immature anger. Wearing designer clothes alone doesn't make you an asshole, looking down on people and treating them like shit because of their perceived socioeconomic status does.",

So many people are literally living paycheck to paycheck.

How feasible is it to have $20 in your hand and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to save this so that, one day, maybe, I can buy a nice coat\u201d when that same $20 could buy you something that\u2019s actually going to help you here and now and not dangle your hopes on a false dream?

I was raised in the NE US (solidly middle class) and moved to the SE 20 years ago.  I went to CU in the 80\u2019s.  Had my first encounter with a Southerner as my Cornell roommate.  I was totally programmed to be amazed that someone as sophisticated and smart and rich was from the South.  I thought it was an anomaly.  Fast forward I moved to SE and my first week took a statistics class from \u201cVirgil Peavey\u201d, who had a thick syrupy Southern accent and white hair/long mustache, the whole 9 yards.  I was cured of my ignorance/stupidity immediately as he led us through a class where I could barely keep up (and not due to the accent).  Later learned of his stature as a preeminent statistician and educator.  Another eye opener was the benefits of being in a society with a sizable Black middle class, in addition to lower and upper classes.  The cultural and educational offerings here in the South have benefitted from greatly from the depth of middle class society here. My understanding of Southern diversity has been a rich part of my life and my family\u2019s life here in the South.  I am a POC, but not Black.",

As a quick request to the people with an income of above the median in their state who consider themselves Progressive - I understand that you want to care.  Please try to put yourself in situations where you socialize with people who aren't wealthy.  Sit down and have dinner with someone who doesn't have a 4 year degree and listen to them about their lives at some point in your college career.  Even if they say things you hate.  When you have an idea of how to \"fix things/ change the world, etc.\" - try to have friends/ connections with people who aren't as privileged as you.  Sometimes things you want to do are a good idea!  Some things have obvious problems that only people less privileged are going to see even if you mean well, and it's hard to tell which from a privileged position.  Thanks!",

As I said to another commenter, we have worked ten times as hard as some populations in this school to be where we are today yet we command little respect from them or the administration for doing it. We\u2019re an afterthought.\n\nThings may never change, but I\u2019m not going to just accept that and move on. We can do better and we must do better.",

Bragging about being crazy over worked at entry level jobs for absurd paychecks, it\u2019s like they never left Cornell and want that atmosphere. Having disposable income like that has effected them too, they talk positively about gentrification in their cities and when I try to talk deeper about it they can shrug it off as not my problem. \n\nI totally agree with what you said about performative activism, I feel like I met so many Cornell students who were willing to talk on and on about lgbtq rights and trump but the second you bring up an issue involving money they hush up quick. It really shows students wanna be progressive until it affects their income.",

Although we have the luxury of not having to work through school, we have to fight every day past culture shock, food insecurity, social alienation, imposter syndrome, and feeling alone both here at Cornell because we\u2019re too poor and where we grew up because we\u2019re too elite. It\u2019s amazing beyond description to come to a premiere institution and get to study and learn and do research, but also difficult to navigate such a different world, especially when far away from everything in one\u2019s past.",

I wholeheartedly agree that we should be proud of our perseverance but that doesn\u2019t mean the suffering was something profound that we should have to go through, or other students or students after us should also have to experience.",

It very much comes across as a \u201cgotcha\u201d in that it very much aims to delegitimize and belittle the experiences and thoughts of those that have faced steep odds to get to where they are today. Arguing that we are being \u201cemotionally charged\u201d really is tone deaf and largely supports the points that I\u2019ve made in this post.\n\nSecondly, I don\u2019t disagree with your argument about meritocracy. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. Someone of a lower-income grouping has to work ten times as hard just to have the shot at a place like Cornell. Meanwhile, someone of a higher-income bracket has the keys practically handed to them because of the amount of opportunities and advantages that they have had handed to them. That\u2019s my entire point. That many people here are privileged in comparison to their less fortunate peers.\n\nI think you\u2019re coming from a good place with this, but it is incredibly dismissive. You don\u2019t have to tell people that have struggled to get to this point to continue to overcome adversity, we already know we have to. The point is that we shouldn\u2019t have to be dealing with adversity still.",

That 100% can be changed. Furthermore, the reason things are the way they are in the real world is because of the policies that are used in post-secondary education to prop up and reinforce wealthier groups.

I definitely had friends who were richer than me (i got so much fin aid i got paid to go to cornell my last semester lol, but I'm definitely more middle class despite how that sounds), but a lot of them were ppl whose parents only became wealthy in their lifetime, so it wasn't like generational wealth but ppl that understood how lucky they were, or certainly had no interest in flaunting anything. And I've also met and have friends who are way worse than me financially. I think part of this is affected by your major and dorm but in general I think every major is going to have some ppl who are obnoxious about these things and some who are not. And like, we're all probably going to have to deal with people like this in our careers too, so it doesn't hurt to get used to dealing with them now.",

If it makes you feel better, I really did not know any of them were rich before I became friends with them haha. Even up until graduating i still found myself assuming ppl were closer to my economic status than they were, because i expect rich ppl to act like legacy frat/sorority kids, and not normal ppl.

It\u2019s a small minority, though. \n\nFar more *indirectly* pay their way in: \n- I\u2019ve met a few (though not many) students who admitted to cheating on standardized tests and high-school assignments thanks to money. Those high test scores and grades got them admitted.\n- Significantly more get in with the help of legacy, which, though not enough to get someone who\u2019s very under-qualified accepted, can push someone who\u2019s already mostly qualified higher on the acceptance list. Legacy typically correlates with money, since previous generations didn\u2019t have as generous of financial aid and thus had to pay more tuition. \n- A great many students are here not because they\u2019re particularly gifted or creative or have a spark for learning, but because they were bred to go here from birth. They went to prep school from the time they were toilet trained up until they matriculated at Cornell. If you pour tens of thousands of dollars into an average kid\u2019s brain, what you end up with is an exceptional kid. With enough money, most average people can become \u201cIvy smart,\u201d even if they wouldn\u2019t naturally be inclined towards the life of the mind. The sad thing is that I\u2019ve met **so many** of these people,  and they all tell me that they feel lost, that they don\u2019t know what they want to do with their lives, and that they\u2019re good at many things because they\u2019ve had private tutoring and extra classes in so many subjects, but not passionate about or driven towards any one thing. They also tend to suffer from a great deal of stress and anxiety because their parents push them to succeed, but they don\u2019t genuinely care about school. These are the students who remind me that it\u2019s better to be average and at peace with oneself than spectacular and always feel like an imposter. I hope they can see that one day, too.",

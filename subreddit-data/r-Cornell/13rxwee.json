    "postText": "Hi, so I'm an incoming freshman trying to get my A&amp;S language credits out of the way in two semesters while also taking a language that I won't absolutely hate, which has landed me with either Russian or Korean. I'm wondering if students with experience in taking the introductory courses for either of them would be willing to give their opinions/advice on the teachers and the difficulty of the courses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some background, I already know Hangul and a bit of basic Korean from an after-school program I was part of a few years back and I seem to remember enjoying learning it. I don't remember much, since it was a while ago, but I'm still confident in my pronunciation/hangul. My main concern is that it's going to be a class of kpop stans.\n\nI'm interested in Russian mainly because I'm a big fan of Russian literature, but I also think it's a super neat-sounding language. Unlike Korean, I have no experience with it, so I would be a complete beginner. I have a friend currently taking it at a different school, and they have loved it.\n\nI've heard that Russian is also easier than Korean, but because I have more background in Korean I feel like it would be harder. Maybe that would be true for the beginning, but Korean would end up being much more difficult in that second semester? I don't know. Also if I decided to study abroad, Korean would be a lot more useful than Russian. I'd appreciate any words of advice or wisdom :)",

It can be very time consuming especially with out of class homework, but I still enjoyed both, and got good grades. I\u2019ve heard Korean is similar.",

            "comment": "I am an upcoming 3rd year student in the Russian Language Program going into my 5th semester in the language. I've loved the experience so far and started out completely new, just like you. The teachers are amazing and three of them teach all the classes you would take together: Slava Paperno, Viktoria Tsimberov, and Raissa Krivitsky. They teach according to the levels of the class and (Slava especially, who leads the department) seem to pick up how each student is doing. All aspects of the language are well explored in their classes: culture (comes up a fair bit, though not a formal course addition), speaking, grammar, writing (including handwritten), and reading. Each day is designed for a specific aspect. \n\nFor example:\nOn Mondays/Wednesdays you'll be with Viktoria for film/video translation discussion and verbs\nOn Tuesdays/Thrusdays you'll be with Slava for grammar, vocabulary, reading and speaking practice. \nOn Fridays you'll have a review class with Raissa.\n\nIt is tough to start any language from scratch but RUSSA goes easy to start, introducing you with \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442 ____ and \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435 (my name is___ and hello). You'll pick up the alphabet, letter sounds and writing in a few days and from there it's very fun to start reading russian literature that they introduce in their courses. \n\nRussian teachers are amazing and the course is not hard. It will take a chunk out of each day like any language does at cornell but you'll learn a lot.",

There might be more in the beginners class but many drop after during the add period. The teachers teach each class so you get to know them pretty well but I didn't know them before. Because the classes are small you'll get the individual attention you need in a language that is lacking in most high schools.",

Unless you like kpop, kdrama, or are generally a koreaboo, I think Russian is the better choice.\n\nAs you may know, Korean is a very very very easy language to learn. King Sejong the Great specifically had it so that illiterate peasants could learn to read and write. You can even learn korean on your own pretty easily.",

I hate kpop but I still enjoyed the class!",

There are 4 sections with ~15 people in each. Everyone knows each other by name since it\u2019s a small class. To enroll, you need to email the professor if there are any seats available for any of the sections, and she\u2019ll give you an enrollment code. Seats fill up very quickly though, so if you\u2019re interested, you should email her *ASAP*. I couldn\u2019t get into the class as a freshman bc of the seat limits, and had to take it as a sophomore (and even then I was on the waitlist.)\n\nThe professor is a very good teacher; explains the concepts very well, makes extensive language resources\u2026 she wrote the textbook and workbook as well. She\u2019s also a very kind and sweet woman! The TAs are super kind and supportive as well.",

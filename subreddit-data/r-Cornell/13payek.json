    "postText": "Hey Cornell Reddit,\n\nI know this is super late but I'm looking for a subletter for a spacious 2 bed, 2 bath apartment in Collegetown Terrace for June and July. The apartment is in walkable distance to the commons and the campus. The apartment is available for $700 a month but price is negotiable ($1250 market rate so a true steal). The apartment complex comes with many perks such as a state-of-the art gym, high quality appliances, full furnishings, a porch, and great natural lighting. It will be move in ready for you on June 1st. The second bedroom will currently be vacant. You can also move in any stuff prior to June if needed.\n\nIf interested, email [ljd222@cornell.edu](mailto:ljd222@cornell.edu). I've also attached a video walk through below and can coordinate an in-person walkthrough if interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Walkthrough of Unit](https://reddit.com/link/13payek/video/ay2p72ngrh1b1/player)",

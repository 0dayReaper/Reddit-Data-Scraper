    "postText": "Hello, I'm an incoming freshman rooming in Lowrise 7 and had some questions!\n\n1. I heard that the heating in the winter is powerful, almost too powerful. Is there a way to turn the radiator off or change the heating at all?\n2. How does the room number system work? for example, I'm in room 7244...I've heard different things so I'm a little confused\n3. How big are the double rooms?\n4. Any advice for incoming freshmen in Lowrise? Feel like I only see the negative lol\n\nThanks!",

I feel like someone told me you could adjust the temp by three degrees, but that might've been BS. I somehow ended up having two extreme issues with my heat. One time, it was way too hot no matter what I did, and another time, in the dead of winter, it broke entirely. Both times, I had to call maintenance to fix it. While I think I was unlucky in that regard, I do seem to recall people complaining about their heat being too high as well.\n2. The room number means you're in LR7, Unit 2, Suite 4, Room 4, hence 7244. LR7 has four units, each with a common space, a kitchen, and 6 suites. Each suite contains 4 rooms (usually two singles, a double, and a triple) and a bathroom.\n3. The doubles are decently sized in my opinion. The room isn't too congested, even with the beds, desks, and wardrobes. What really sucks is when those doubles become forced triples.\n4. Honestly, I really enjoyed living in low rise, even with its flaws. I think the way the units are set up actually encourages socializing because most people have to pass through the common space to get to their rooms. I was in unit 1 though I also knew quite a few people from unit 2, and I remember both units being pretty social. This was also before covid, so my experience is probably much different from that of more recent students. I hope that things are better for incoming freshman now that covid is (kind of) in the past.\n\nOverall, I'd say embrace what you've been given, and you'll have a good time. I have some strange but great memories of that place :)",

Freshman year is random if you don\u2019t apply to programs, and for sophomore year it\u2019s randomized for which time slot you get to pick the dorm/room you want even if u get into program.",

The good thing about a program house is that the residents tend to be more social within the dorm and you're more likely to make friends there, if you're willing. Of the old dorms, the HR/LR system isn't the worst either. At least you have suites with only 6 other people sharing a bathroom. If you're somewhere like Donlon, it's just long hallways and you're sharing bathrooms with a ton more people.",

    "postText": "According to College Avenue construction foreman Giuseppe Scungerelli, \"his guys\" are being called away from Ithaca to assist in what could be a year or more-long project rebuilding the I-95 overpass that collapsed in downtown Philadelphia yesterday morning. \"I mean, who's really gonna notice?\" chuckled Scungerelli. \"We just park a few excavators, put up some barrels and the \"Road Closed\" sign, and things'll be pretty much like they've been since...\" At that point Scungerelli's voice trailed off. He called out to \"Vito,\" to ask if he knew when exactly they had started the work on College Ave , and all the workers within earshot burst out in uncontrollable laughter.",

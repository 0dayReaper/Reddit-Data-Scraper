    "postText": "I\u2019m ending my sophomore year with a little self reflection. I do not drink but I have found myself with a friend group that enjoys drinking and partying as their main activities which is good for them but not particularly my thing. I have tried going out with them but it\u2019s never fun and I usually get the responsibility of taking care of everyone as the only sober person. Where do people find others that do not drink since I have yet to meet anyone. I have reached a place where I need someplace more aligned with what I want to do and not put myself in situations where I feel deeply uncomfortable. For those who don\u2019t drink where did you find your friends and how do you engage in social life at Cornell where there\u2019s a big drinking scene (from what I have experienced)",

On the other hand, as long as ur friends are somewhat responsible drinkers (as u don't have to often take care of them or clean up after them) its quite fun to chat with the drunk versions of them.",

Something about Ithaca being so isolated and Greek Life and multicultural orgs ruling the traditional social scene here makes being intoxicated or high the #1 things to do for fun.\n\nI've joined clubs where drinking is the furthest thing from being relevant, and even then, the top activities everyone chose to bond over were drinking and smoking.\n\nPeople are always like jUSt MeEt LiKeMinDeD pEoPle, and like yeah there's sober people here, but that doesn't mean I connect with them. I vibe well with hyper-social people, but said people also tend to be the ones who just want to go out and get blitzed.\n\nThe main result is honestly that I don't feel a strong belonging to any friend group or anywhere here period and am more about individual connections in a wide range of social spheres.\n\nIt kinda sucks, and I definitely feel like I've missed out on stereotypical coming-of-age experiences, but I feel more like an \"actual adult\" these days than anything.",

I do have friends who don't drink but I also have friends who like to party and drink as well. When I hang out with the friends who are doing drinking games or whatever, they understand their own personal responsibility for the most part and even include me in things that make it still fun to be a part of while respecting my boundaries. Maybe it helps that most of them were seniors and we were in the house a few of them live in, but they want to make it fun for everyone, including the people who don't want to drink (it wasn't just me).\n\nYou have to be willing to set boundaries and I think  that's the major issue for you. I'm willing to walk someone back to their dorm or whatever if they're slightly drunk and just want some supervision, but I'm not going to babysit someone who needs my full attention every time. Sure accidents happen and I understand that and my friends know that I'll be there if they need help in a rarer situation, but I'm also not going to do everything for them. If you can't have these conversations with your friends or they won't listen I'd reconsider being friends with them because they should care about how you feel as well, especially if you're the one being responsible for them when they went too far",

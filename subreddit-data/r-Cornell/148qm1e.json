The environment was really good, I met a lot of my close friends there and everyone was super friendly. \nGoing into the year, I was also a bit hesitant living in all female but honestly a lot of people come over to work at McClintock so it felt almost co-Ed. But, chances are u won\u2019t be in the dorm too much anyways. Plus if your lucky with your pod mates, the bathroom situation is cleaner :)",

Relaxing but low energy and I've seen him at least twice. Nelly is a good fit though. Slope Day should be an artist with a lively show and a name that gets people interested, and a local band, a DJ or two, and a local rapper. Open it to students, alumni, and maybe a named plus 1. Charge admission for alumni.\n\nJoywave would probably do it every year if asked.",

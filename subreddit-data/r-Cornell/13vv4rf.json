    "postText": "hi everyone! I currently am assigned to a triple in Alice Cook Baker North **ground floor** and was wondering if anyone with a triple \\*\\*on the third floor \\*\\* of Baker North is willing to switch. This is a super long shot since I know rarely anyone has a triple, but just putting it out there. I went to visit the third-floor room and the girl told me it's usually given to transfers. Please let me know!",

    "postText": "I am currently a first year Econ student at Bocconi University (Milan). I was accepted Transfer Option to Cornell last year before I decided to come here. This means I have the option to transfer to Cornell for my second year of university, but I'm not sure if I want to. \n\nI really like the social and cultural life here in Bocconi; people are great, love the city, love being in Europe. However I don't like the teaching style at all. All of my classes are really big auditoriums with over 100 people, there's no place for discussions, exams are based on memorization, pretty bad professors, no projects, essays or anything interactive. \n\nI feel like I might enjoy the education in Cornell more, but I'm worried about the social aspect. I wouldn't like not being in a city, the weather is bad, I'm not sure if American culture is for me. But at the end of the day, it's an Ivy League, and it has good name. \n\nAlso, its a 3-year bachelor in Bocconi vs four years in Cornell. Tell me what you think.",

You can have a measly job in Europe and pay your bills and think you\u2019re part of the middle class and not really have another want in your life and be fine. Here\u2026 You\u2019re going to be making six figures and you think you\u2019re not making enough. You will have near perfect marks, and still not get the job, and will spend a very long time Wondering if you\u2019re good enough.\n\nEven with all that, many people come here and flourish. The question is if it\u2019s for you. And that\u2019s only a question you can answer.",

If you\u2019re planning to work in Europe, having a US-based network wouldn\u2019t be helpful either. It seems like the only thing going for Cornell in your case would be that you might prefer the teaching style here, which might be a bit better based on the criteria you mentioned, but definitely not enough to make transferring worth it.",

There is a lot to be said for finishing college where you started unless you are unhappy there. If your plans include postgraduate education you will have your chance at a different teaching approach, and you are happy socially. If you have ambitions that you feel will be hard to achieve from where you are, then bite the bullet and transfer. You will have to make efforts socially, but Cornell is a great place.",

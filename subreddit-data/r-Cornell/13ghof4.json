Affordable rent ($600 per month, negotiable) and you will have three other students living with you (all male). \n\nQuiet complex, bus stop nearby, walkable distance to campus (it's like living on West), utilities included, laundry on-site!\n\nPlease PM me if you're interested or would like more information/video tour!",

I prefer the area bc it helps with spin along with sinquo (idk how to spell it) strings. If ur looking for stability and a better overall doubles player racket then the strike wouldn\u2019t be a bad option bc ur gonna be at the net more. I am a former strike user and I like the area more bc it feels more natural getting spin from the baseline but I like the strike at the net more bc as I said it\u2019s more stable. Idk much ppl that use the drive over these 2",

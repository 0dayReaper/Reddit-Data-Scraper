I will preface by saying that I truly believe all struggles with mental health are valid and it is not in any way a competition, but my impression of EARS/Peer Mentoring is that it is for people experiencing milder/non-debilitating symptoms. I can\u2019t speak for all people with chronic mental health issues but with things that are perceived as more \u201csevere\u201d like mood disorders or severe depression I\u2019ve never felt like anyone my age or younger who hasn\u2019t experienced it or who isn\u2019t a trained professional could say anything helpful. But these are only my assumptions and why I wouldn\u2019t go, if other people who have gone have different experiences that\u2019s great! \n\n2. It\u2019s embarrassing, to be honest. I don\u2019t want my peers or people I know to know that I might be suicidal or having paranoid thoughts or engaging in anything dangerous. I\u2019ve had so many people just point blank ask about old scars or my behavior that talking openly about my experiences is too scary. \n\n3. Also people who do EARS are (i assume) mandatory reporters so I would never tell them anything more than surface level stuff \n\nThat all being said I still think it\u2019s great that EARS is available and that they\u2019re trying to get more people to use it:)",

Yes, you are correct in that the Peer Mentors are not allowed to \u201ctreat\u201d mental illness. If someone wanted to talk about their experience with a mental disorder, Peer Mentors are there to provide empathetic support and active listening but not clinical diagnoses or formulations. \n\n2. I\u2019m really sorry to hear that this is the experience you\u2019ve been having. I can totally understand how having people ask you about things in that manner can feel so intrusive. If you need any directions to resources or mental health professionals please always feel free to DM me! The EARS Peer Mentors are also trained in providing referrals, so even if you just wanted to drop by and ask for those they would love to help you out. \n\n3. Everything that is said during a Peer Mentoring conversation is kept confidential, with these two exceptions: a) the person poses serious risk of harming themselves; b) they pose the risk of harming others. In those cases Peer Mentors are obliged to bring in mental health professionals who are trained and qualified in crisis intervention protocols. I guess that is part of the problem you mentioned - people not really wanting others to know about their suicidal ideation. But otherwise, everything is kept private. It may seem awkward to trust a peer with certain issues and it\u2019s definitely understandable to feel dubious about whether the privacy policy is maintained, but I think it helps to know that many Peer Mentors are people who want to commit their lives to professions in the mental health field and violating the policy would go against their core values/principles.",

The good news; because I took the  course I won an all expense paid two week wine Tasting tour of Italy.  The bad news; scheduling it right before a Chem lab was not a great  decision.\"*",

            "comment": "Wow, this is amazing.\n\n*\"At the end of Prof. Lafeber\u2019s first semester course in the fall of 1973,  the students gave him a standing ovation, but he had already quickly  left the classroom, I believe, in anticipation of exactly that  happening.  He was the most self-effacing man.*\n\n*Second semester, in  Spring, 1974, we were not so easily denied. With 10 minutes to go in the  last class, in what was clearly a planned and brilliantly strategic  move, two very large guys got out of their class seats and stood right  next to each other in front of the doors in this classroom in Ives,  barring any exit.  This clearly was not going to be allowed to happen  again.*\n\n*When he said the final words of his final lecture, he jumped up  off the front table, which he almost always had been sitting on with his  legs dangling while he lectured, and started walking towards the doors.  As he approached the guys, I was in the front row, I recall one of them  saying to them, \u201cNot this time, Professor. Turn around and take it.\u201c*\n\n*And Professor Lafeber was instantly engulfed by wildly cheering  students, shaking his hand, patting him on the back, and profusely  thanking him.  It was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had.  He was, and I have taught for many years, simply the greatest professor I  ever saw. By far.\"*",

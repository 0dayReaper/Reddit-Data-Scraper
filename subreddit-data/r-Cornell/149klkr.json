    "postText": "I recently got my dorm assignment for Donlon Hall and I absolutely hate it. I've heard so many horrible things about the partying, the loud noises that keep people up at night, and the disgusting bathrooms. I know Donlon is super social and everybody's always going in and out of each others rooms, but that's just not me. I need somewhere quiet and clean, and I really don't want anyone I don't know coming into my room. So PLEASE if anyone is willing to switch contact me!!",

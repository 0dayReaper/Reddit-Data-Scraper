    "postText": "I recently got my dorm assignment for Donlon Hall and I absolutely hate it. I've heard so many horrible things about the partying, the loud noises that keep people up at night, and the disgusting bathrooms. I know Donlon is super social and everybody's always going in and out of each others rooms, but that's just not me. I need somewhere quiet and clean, and I really don't want anyone I don't know coming into my room. So PLEASE if anyone is willing to switch contact me!!",

Upon sleeping on top of me, he realized that he had entered the wrong room, apologized, and left. He smelled like Mike's hard lemonade. Learned to lock my door after that.",

It isn\u2019t a new dorm but it\u2019s your average dorm, and the most social, which you may find to be a plus. Again, stop stressing , you most likely will not find a desirable switch. My friend was in donlon last year and loved it",

My friends that are in their 3rd and 4th years all said the bathrooms are disgusting and there's usually vomit and who knows what else. Bathrooms are an important space for me and it's really going to stress me out if it's that dirty.",

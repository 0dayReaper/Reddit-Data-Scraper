            "comment": "Bethe House Main is a newer building (completed around 2007) and has more modern amenities.  McFaddin is what we called Gothics and was built in 1928.  Everything inside was much older and has much less amenities (be prepared to walk a few flight of stairs if you are assigned to the higher floor room).  Room size and layout in the Gothics can be quirky and some students hated it in the beginning but eventually some fell in love with the Gothics. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell\\_West\\_Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_West_Campus)\n\nUse the search bar above to read what some local residents think about McFaddin. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/wbdegd/whats\\_mcfaddin\\_hall\\_like/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/wbdegd/whats_mcfaddin_hall_like/)",

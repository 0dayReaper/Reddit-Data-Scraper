Imagine how big they'll be in another 40 years!\n\nThat said, is that really the main staircase into Carpenter?  In my day, we entered from the other side, and on the main level was the Engineering library, upstairs were some offices and a classroom or two, and downstairs was a computer lab, which was filled with the original Macintosh with 128 KB RAM, only a 3.5\" floppy drive (no hard drive), and a 9\" monochrome built-in monitor.  (On which we were somehow able to use Adobe PageMaker to lay out a 64-page magazine.)",

    "postText": " \n\nHey everyone,\n\nI am a rising sophomore in CoE, and was curious whether there was a possibility of petitioning CS2800 - instead of taking 2800, I want to request to fulfill this requirement in the CS curriculum with an upperdiv math course like number theory (3320), applicable algebra (3360) or combinatorics (4410), which all seem like \"higher-level\" versions of 2800. At most schools, taking a higher level version of a course usually fulfills the requirement, so do you think it would be the same at Cornell? \\[3360 seems the most interesting tbh and covers many topics tangential to 2800 at a higher level\\]\n\nI did a lot of comp/discrete math in HS and am very familiar with 2800's material, and would be more than willing to self-study to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I ultimately do come to college to learn new things, and 2800 intersects with a lot of interesting classes I want to take next sem (I do not want to delay taking these classes in order to take 2800).\n\nThank you for your time and advice.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not very familiar with this petitioning process. However, I want to let you know that 2800 has been moving away from number theory and towards combinatorics/probability recently. I took 2800 last semester and 3360 this semester. I think they\u2019re very different courses\u2014with 2800 covers many topics at a lower level and 3360 focusing entirely on algebra and number theory. The algebra content in 2800 when I took it was very little; for example, it never introduced congruence classes, which is a fundamental topic in 3360 that is used throughout the semester.",

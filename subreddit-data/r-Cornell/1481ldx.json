The layout is a pod style so, in every pod, there\u2019s one single room and then two doubles and then the bathroom is in the hallway as well. You only share the bathroom with four other people so it\u2019s nice. The community is also really great, and there\u2019s always fun activities being organized by the RA\u2019s or the RHD. \n\nConsider yourself very lucky because you won the housing lottery! Good luck with everything, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions about McClintock or just freshman year in general!!",

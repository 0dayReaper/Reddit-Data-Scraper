But in the most recent Cornell outbreak, it went from 50 to 260, and will continue to rise. They\u2019re not even on the same level. Sure, most of the infected are vaccinated students, but if 2000 students are infected (were close to that number), at least a dozen of them might require hospitalization (although some of them may have left Ithaca). Then when it spreads to the non Cornell population (TCHD has seen evidence of it), hospitalization will likely rise further.\n\nSee for yourself: https://tompkinscountyny.gov/health/factsheets/coronavirusdata",

Of course now the spreading variant is omicron which is also generally considered milder.\n\nEdit: I realized the initial attachment I did shows figures for Illinois for hospitalizations, but the point stands.",

That tells us how worried we should be *if* we catch it.\n\nGenerally younger folk don't have that much to worry about personally if they catch it (of course, exceptions do happen), but the dangers are much higher in the elderly.\n\nSo, case counts are generally what we want to focus on and yes panic is rarely a good thing so I'm not sure what point you are trying to make.

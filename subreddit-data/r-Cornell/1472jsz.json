    "postText": "I know a family of three that is badly in need of a place to stay for just this fall. As expected, 99% of places in Ithaca are strictly 10-month or 12-month leases and will not consider anything shorter. However, this family only needs a place **from around early August to late December**. Exact dates are flexible, but it would need to be something in the range of a 5 or 6 month lease OR just going month by month; they would be moving out in December for certain, and can't commit to signing for a full year.\n\nOther details / requirements:\n\n**Unit type:** 2 bedroom or 3 bedroom unit (either one is fine) with no other tenants living in the same unit. Can be a house, can be an apartment, can be a cabin--as long as it's livable.\n\n**Location:** As long as it's \"in Ithaca\" or close by, pretty much anywhere works. Can be a little out of the way as long as it's near a reliable bus route.\n\n**Price:** Obviously the cheaper the better, but mostly anything under $2,400/month \\*total\\* (for a 2BR **or** 3BR) will do.\n\n**Pets:** They have one cat and one dog.\n\nIf you know of anything that could work, please leave a comment or send me a chat message! \n\nThank you.",

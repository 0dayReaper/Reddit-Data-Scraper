    "postText": "I've been interested in this for some time, since zoning law sounds super interesting (Someone I know actually told me they're looking for more people to focus on this in particular) + It seems like an easy ticket to a T14 at a place I already love + it shaves a year off undergrad\n\nBesides this, I've considered a 1 year Masters in Regional Planning offered here or a 2 year Masters in Regional Science (difference is that the MRP is more technical and practicality focused, MRS is more research and theory based) or a masters in something government related\n\nIn terms of requirements, I can easily fill out my major reqs in 3 years if I take 20 creds a semester and I can probably stay above a 3.5 (at 3.7 right now). Besides that, I feel like the hardest thing is the LSAT\n\nI'm thinking about this now because itll probably change how I approach the next two years and will require a bit of grinding to get. Assuming I can meet the academic side of things, how hard will it be to get in? Would it be possible to specialize?",

You\u2019ve great experiences in land, urban planning and other areas which could be useful for lawyering on both litigation and transaction.",

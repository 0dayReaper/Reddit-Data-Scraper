            "comment": "Personal anecdote: my WSL peers have had ten times the troubleshooting troubles across my programming courses over people using macOS or Linux. Ten times is under exaggeration really since I had none and a peer of mine was having so many issues on 3110\u2019s final project they ended up messing around with trying to create an entire Ubuntu VM from frustration. But when I see crammed office hours and tech support Ed discussion posts, it\u2019s usually WSL finnicky business. In general a programmer should have easy access to a Unix environment and while WSL promises that, it probably can\u2019t ever be as streamlined as using an outright Unix based system. \n\nThat said, a majority of CS kids will use Windows because it came preinstalled on their laptops and they\u2019re not one to find that the learning curves and application ecosystem shifts of moving from the only OS they know to macOS or Linux would be worth slightly less occasional hassles. Your OS choice won\u2019t determine if you pass the class or anything of significance, and help is abundantly available. So at the end of the day it still just boils down to what you\u2019re most comfortable with overall.\n\nFor laptops, personal take is get a Thinkpad, XPS, or MacBook and you\u2019ll be fine.",

And you can\u2019t even drag and hover, you have to hold the green button to tile left or right.. Windows 11\u2019s native window management is way better (which is why you see people always having hovering windows that aren\u2019t using the entire screen on mac) \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/applesucks/comments/uclfdd/macos_window_management/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/wvb4fa/why_apple_doesnt_care_that_window_management_sucks/\n\nbut MacBooks are better for efficiency and not needing to charge as much compared to most windows machines.. at least until intel/amd come up with their powerhouse ARM SoC. Now that apple silicon is here, people who aren\u2019t apple fanboys see MacBooks as actual options, which is valid.\n\nSo if you are already used to macOS and can afford it go with mac\n\nReally it should just be based on your preference.",

One could even make the case that macOS\u2019s history of strong tiling window manager support e.g. Amethyst and Yabai in the vein of Linux\u2019s i3, sway, dwm, etc. make for a potentially way better desktop experience than what you can get on Windows.",

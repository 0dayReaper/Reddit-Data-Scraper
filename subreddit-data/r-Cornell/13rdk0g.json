Two years ago I did it for like a month and a half because I had a similar financial situation, essentially just slept in the really big halls and took showers every other day at a specific place but wanted to gauge if folks thought it was feasible to do for like a full semester\n\nI recognize this is sort of an insane idea to think but having like done it before for a short time + the prospect of saving a lot of money it\u2019s hard to not talk myself into it",

Hell, get an apt in Cortland if you need to. Not everyone needs to live in Ithaca, and honestly not all students can or do because there\u2019s just not enough housing.",

If your family's finances have changed you can tell them about it and appeal your package.  If you never submitted a FAFSA, talk to them about that and if you are getting nothing when you normally would get aid, then I would take a leave until your financial aid is settled.",

How likely is this to happen, and if so when would it be safe to return to Ithaca?",

Nonetheless, no current projection indicates fires will last for months. The latest IPCC report has very low confidence on the increase in long term fires at high latitudes due to multiple, overlapping factors. For this one in particular, no attribution was yet made.\nWhich is all to say: yes, climate change is an issue. No, nobody has ever suggested it will make us stay indoor all the times.\nSource: I\u2019m a climate scientist \ud83d\ude0a",

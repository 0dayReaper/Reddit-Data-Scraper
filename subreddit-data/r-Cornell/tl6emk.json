Just thought Id let you know That they are going to catch you, but if you DM me and return my clothes before they do, i wont be pressing charges. Those clothes were my entire wardrobe, including a lot of my fathers clothes that he left me when he passed away. Im willing to extend enough empathy to you that I would be willing not to press charges, maybe youll have some human decency and return things that are literally the last things their dying parents left them, but ig well see.",

I knew several kleptomaniacs and could never wrap my mind around why they stole things. One would steal bikes, ride them far away, and dump them off where the owners couldn\u2019t find them just for the thrill of it. Another stole a painting he didn\u2019t even care about for no good reason. I asked these people why they stole, and they told me they honestly didn\u2019t know. \n\nInterestingly, they were all from very rich families, so I suspect it might have something to do with not being able to grasp the value and meaning of money/material goods to people who actually have to work for what they own or who, like the O.P., have sentimental attachment to their things.\n\nWatch out, kids: Elite institutions are full of people who are very unhinged in very unnerving and eccentric ways. (I\u2019m remembering stories about a student who smeared their feces all over the showers in one of the North Campus dorms.)",

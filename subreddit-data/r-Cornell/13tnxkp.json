    "postText": "They already put a cap on storage last year based off how much you already had on there. But they're deleting the rest of it (minus 5GB for Gmail) pretty soon. Per [official announcements](https://it.cornell.edu/storage-program), it says \"July 2023.\"\n\nDoes that mean July 1st? July 31st? What's the exact day that I should assume my account will be deleted?\n\nI plan to squeeze every last second out of this. Don't judge. I will need some time though to transfer everything so I want to be prepared.",

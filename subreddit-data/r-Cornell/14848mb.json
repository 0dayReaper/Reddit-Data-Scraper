I will be visiting the campus during summer and I would want to know if we are driving from New Jersey how long does it take to reach the campus and I've been given a 3pm slot, so we plan to go back home on the same day.  Or pls advice if we need to take a break and stay in the hotel for a day",

On Sunday morning, it took me a little over 3 hours to drive from Cornell to EWR Airport in Newark. When I was a student, I had similar drive times. Hope this helps a frame of reference!",

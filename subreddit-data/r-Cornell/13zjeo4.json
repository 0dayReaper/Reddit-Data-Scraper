            "comment": "In my opinion, _YLIA_ has by far the best general OSTs (\"My Truth\", \"Otouto Mitai na Sonzai\", etc.). Music is central to the anime, and almost every track is really good. It's around 4 hours for the sixty tracks; during my commutes to my internship in Summer 2015 and Summer 2016, I would listen to the entire soundtrack on the bus ride there and back daily :)\n\nMy favorite OST specifically is \"Glassy Sky\" from _Tokyo Ghoul_, with \"Komm, s\u00fcsser Tod\" from _EoE_ in second. But I'd say _Clannad: After Story_ has some bangers too\n\nMy favorite ED is \"Waltz\" from _Honey and Clover_, with \"Fukashigi no Karte\" from _Bunny Girl Senpai_ in second \n\nMy favorite OP is definitely \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\" from _NGE_, with \"Harumodoki\" from _Oregairu_ in second, though I think \"Again\" from _FMA:B_ is really good too\n\nFor anime film EDs, my favorite is \"One More Time, One More Chance\" from _5 Centimeters per Second_, with \"Rain\" from _Garden of Words_ in second\n\nFor anime film OSTs in general, _Sprited Away_ is pretty unbeatable for an all-around stellar soundtrack",

There are several rooms available for small group study as well. St. Luke hosted study hours for many years before the pandemic and is excited to offer this community service once again! No proselytizing, just helping the community. Spread the word!\u00a0\n\n**PLUS: Saturday, May 13 from noon-4pm, there will be \"Pause for Paws\" with friendly pets on site for calming cuddles!**\u00a0\n\n[More info](https://stlukeithaca.org/study-hours/)",

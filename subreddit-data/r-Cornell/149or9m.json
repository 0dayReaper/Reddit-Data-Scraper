    "postText": "Once upon a time, nestled amidst the chaos of university life, there existed a dormitory so delightfully peculiar that its residents couldn't help but sing its praises. Welcome to the legendary Donlon, where sleepless nights and questionable hygiene find solace in a bizarrely captivating way.\n\nDonlon is known for its breathtaking architecture\u2014bare walls adorned with eclectic doodles and mismatched posters. The peeling paint adds a touch of rustic charm, while the mysterious stains on the carpet create a sense of adventure for the discerning explorer. Each room is a microcosm of chaos, where an organized mess is seen as a testament to one's ability to locate socks amidst the chaos.\n\nLiving in Donlon means immersing yourself in a vibrant social scene, where the walls are so paper-thin that privacy becomes a thing of the past. Your neighbors become an integral part of your daily routine as you participate in impromptu karaoke sessions at 3 a.m. and engage in passionate debates about the profound philosophical implications of instant ramen noodles.\n\nThe culinary delights of Donlon are truly an experience that defies the conventional definition of \"edible.\" The communal kitchen, reminiscent of a mad scientist's laboratory, is a testament to the inventiveness of its inhabitants. From microwave experiments gone awry to questionable concoctions made from dorm-room staples, the culinary adventures in Donlon rival those of a Michelin-starred restaurant. Who needs flavor and nutrition when you can have the thrill of culinary experimentation?\n\nWhen it comes to cleanliness, Donlon takes pride in its ability to blur the line between personal hygiene and a social experiment. The shared bathrooms offer an immersive experience in the realm of microbial diversity, where shower sandals are considered a fashion statement and the ever-elusive hot water becomes a myth passed down through generations. The concept of \"cleanliness is next to godliness\" is respectfully disregarded in favor of a more avant-garde approach to personal hygiene.\n\nDonlon location is another reason why it is hailed as the epitome of convenience. Situated conveniently far away from lecture halls and libraries, the daily commute provides a much-needed exercise regimen. As residents navigate through a maze of campus streets, dodging cyclists and skateboard enthusiasts, they develop unparalleled agility and an uncanny ability to survive on minimal sleep.\n\nThe academic atmosphere in Donlon is an intellectual playground where essays are perfected at the very last minute, and group study sessions are a cacophony of procrastination techniques. The walls reverberate with the melodious sounds of keystrokes and the unmistakable aroma of late-night caffeine binges. Who needs a library when you can experience the scholarly ambiance of Donlon\u2019s communal study rooms, complete with ergonomic chairs that resemble medieval torture devices?\n\nAs the night falls upon Donlon, the hallways come alive with a vibrant energy. The symphony of laughter, heated debates, and the occasional fire alarm drill creates an atmosphere so captivating that residents willingly forgo sleep in favor of late-night conversations and unforgettable memories. Donlon is not just a place to rest your head; it's a haven for the curious souls seeking the uncharted territory of communal living.\n\nSo, if you find yourself yearning for a living experience that defies convention and challenges the boundaries of personal comfort, pack your bags and head straight to Donlon. In this peculiar residence hall, you'll encounter a captivating blend of chaos, camaraderie, and questionable hygiene practices. Welcome to Donlon, where sleep deprivation becomes an art form, and the mundane becomes extraordinary.",

Some of the 27s must know something about the dorm- either tik toks or insta videos or whatever and have shared that around. As a first year I'm scared to move in here, I filed out the housing form super early. As an introvert, What did i do to deserve the sleepless nights and lack of privacy, the floor literally shaking from bass and loud music :(",

Just a kid from your ivy league neighbor down from NYC, ofc ranked just below. \n\nGraduated last month, and would love to spend the weekend around Cornell.\n\nAny tips for gorg hiking trails around? Activities? Where to stay for a night, and of course, someone tells me how to sneak into your gym for a session. Got my Columbia UI if that could be of any help lol. If I don't work out, I'd die",

I suppose I\u2019d slightly favor Treman if you wanted to go swimming, and I also think it\u2019s slightly less crowded. For Treman, I recommend the route up that has the gorge to your right; for Buttermilk, I recommend the route up with the gorge on your left (though this one is more obviously The Main Route compared to Treman.)",

Buttermilk falls which is even closer to the Walmart strip is a nice hike also.  Same rules, since its a state park, free walk or bike in, cars cost.  The bus stops right by Buttermilk Falls, just hike up the right side pathway of the falls from the bottom.  You can google pictures of both parks.  Everyone, students and non students can rent a canoe from Cornell Rec in the Teagle building and take it out on Lake Cayuga (the lake is wicked cold right now though so try not to fall in)",

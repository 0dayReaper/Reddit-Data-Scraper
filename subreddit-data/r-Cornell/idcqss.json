At the same time though, I also worry about the implications that such punishment has when it comes to how honest someone that tests positive (and was partying/hanging out in a large group without precautions) will be when questioned by contact tracers, especially considering that someone partying during all this would presumably be the same type of person to lie to contact tracers.",

No one is saying you should sit around and do nothing either, go ahead and have gatherings within a specific bubble. But repeated large gatherings with random groups of people in contained spaces will lead to communal spread, even with the testing protocol. Also, last time I checked, you're paying 70k for a top notch education, not the ability to party. If that's the case IDK why you didn't just go to your local state school... a lot cheaper and likely much better parties.",

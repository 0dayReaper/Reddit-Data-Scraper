    "postText": "I don't have much programming experience, but I'm needing to take a course to fulfill the MQR requirement. Would INFO 3350 be an okay, somewhat manageable option? I know the course says it is intended for those with programming experience, but didn't list any specific CS course prerequisites. Will the course teach and introduce programming as it goes along or does the course assume all students know programming to a degree?",

    "postText": "Hi. I am an incoming postdoc (physics) and am looking for housing.\n\nThe housing options near campus seem a bit outdated or super expensive so I started to look a bit suburban. There are many luxurious apartments in Lansing. There are TCAT bus stops, and looked like great options. It is a bit pricey (1550 + electric + cables) for a postdoc salary but I heard that the bus is free. I might consider getting a cheap car as well. Could locals offer any opinions for me?",

The management got bought out and the new management is sleazy as fuck, they have hiked the rent by 30% or more trying to get the existing tenants out. The location is nice but not worth what they are asking. I'm in a ground floor unit and the insulation is bad, the floor is always uncomfortably cold and the winter electric bill can easily run up to ~$200 for the coldest months. In summer the humidity in the apt can get very high and I have had recurring mold issues although the maintenance people are quick to spray it and get it off. If you do sign up carefully check the lease, they try to enroll you in some service where they charge you $35 per month to forward your electric bill to you, you still have to pay the bill lol. Also if you plan to have a pet, the pet rent has doubled.\npm me if you want more info!",

In addition to everything above and so much more, new leases have a non-disparagement clause, meaning you legally and literally are not allowed to speak poorly of them on any public forum. So anyone who has signed for next year can\u2019t tell you about their horrible experiences. \ud83d\ude43",

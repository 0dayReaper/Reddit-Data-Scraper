I was put into McClintock next fall and was wondering if there was anywhere to find measurements of the rooms online for move in purposes. \nIf anyone was recently in a double in this building I\u2019d love to see a picture of your finished room! Whats the laundry situation and the social vibe?",

            "comment": "I lived in McClintock last year in a single so I\u2019m not sure what the measurements for the double rooms are since I\u2019ve never been inside one. However, it\u2019s basically just like any standard double and maybe even slightly more spacious since it\u2019s a pod style, meaning that it\u2019s in a hallway and the bathroom is in the hallway as well. The pods are set up in that there\u2019s one single and two doubles and then a bathroom. \n\nAs for laundry, there\u2019s a laundry room right on the first floor and they\u2019re usually pretty clean and spacious. People tend to do laundry on weekends, especially Sunday afternoons, so if you do laundry on a random weekday, you should be good and there will be a lot of machines available. As for the social vibe, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s pretty good. The RAs and the RHD organize a lot of fun events to foster community amongst the residents. The dorm is usually pretty quiet as well and people are respectful of each other. I made friends in the dorm through my podmates, the pod across from us, while doing laundry, and so much more! \n\nAlso, you\u2019ll learn more about the specific rules and policies during the meetings, but even though it\u2019s an all-women\u2019s dorm, you can still bring guy friends over and you just need to escort them around the building to make sure everyone feels comfortable. Overall, it\u2019s a really nice dorm and I had a wonderful experience there. You got lucky, for sure. Hope this helped you out a bit! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any more questions about McClintock or about the student experience in general :)",

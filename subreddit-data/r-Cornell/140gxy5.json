            "comment": "Think you\u2019re trying to pack a little too much in there. There\u2019s no issue with leaving some courses for junior year. Issues that I see are labor history (pretty reading and writing intensive) and labor law (extremely reading and writing intensive) in your first semester at Cornell, then following it up with labor Econ+stats the next one which can be tricky historically for a lot of students. So I suggest take only 1 of those 2 each coming semester",

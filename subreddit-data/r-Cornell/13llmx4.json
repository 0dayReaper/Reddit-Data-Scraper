Killian's lectures are what really make this class great though.\n\n**A:**\n\nCS 2110 - Gries \ud83d\udd25, teaches you most of what you need to know for technical interviews.\n\nCS 3110 - Well taught class, you gotta take it anyways but they tried their best to make it worth it. Camel videos \ud83d\udd25 . Some functional programming concepts are pretty useful.\n\nCS 4670 - Good overview of CV, doesn't focus as much on the ML side of CV but still interesting. Reasonable workload and difficulty. Professor Hariharan is very nice/accommodating. Also, koocumbuh. iykyk\n\nCS 4740 - Workload will kill you but you will learn a ton. Prof Cardie's dogs uwu\n\n**B:**\n\nCS 4820 - Teaches you the rest of what you need for technical interviews, but also some stuff that you will probably never see again. Psets painful, programming assignments more painful. But some algorithms are cool!\n\nCS 4830 - Very solid background for cryptography, will definitely learn a lot. Reasonable workload and difficulty. no exams! Proofs got repetitive very quickly though, lots of proving the same things for different scenarios.\n\nCS 4620 - Teaches pretty good basics of graphics, but the stuff in the last third of the class like shaders were not taught that well/covered in great detail. Workload was fine except for the final project which was a bit too rushed. Poor Abe needs more sleep.\n\nCS 4756 - Good content and lectures, Professor Choudhury is very passionate. Workload was ok, assignments were a bit buggy/long because it was the first semester this class was taken. Slides have a concerning amount of minions.\n\nCS 4789 - Math and proof heavy, but you get to learn the RL algorithms thoroughly. The slides are clear and Professor Dean teaches pretty well. Lectures can be dry but you learn a lot.\n\n**C:**\n\nCS 2800 - If this is your first proof-based class it will be hard. Once you make it through you will be prepared for all the other proof-based classes though.\n\nCS 4410 - Lectures are very dry/sleep-inducing but good enough. Lots of memorization for exams. Workload is very low though. Highlight of the class was when Prof Lorenzo said \"mamma mia, there will be a page fault\" \ud83e\udd0c\n\nCS 3410 - Bracy taught the class very well, but there is way too much content. Feels like two classes packed into one. Logisim permanently damaged my brain cells.\n\nCS 4701 - Easy A but didn't learn anything. Can ignore the class till the last 2-3 weeks or 1 week to finish the project depending on how much sleep you want.\n\nCS 4300 - Fun class. You learn quite a bit about information retrieval techniques. Not as intensive as / not much related to NLP. Final project might take a lot of work. Assignments have a concerning amount of Kardashian content.\n\n**D:**\n\nCS 5306 - If you don't care about crowdsourcing and just need a 4 credit class, this will be a pretty boring class. 7:30 PM classes are not it. Attendance required. Low workload though, easyish A. Professor Hirsh is pretty nice and went out of his way to solve issues with MTurk.\n\n**F:**\n\nCS 4260 - Don't unless you were trained in mathematics from age 3 onwards by Euler himself\n\nCS 4621 - Basically copy from YouTube tutorials. No point taking it without any prior experience, bc you will be graded by comparing to other teams' projects. Not related to CS 4620 content.",

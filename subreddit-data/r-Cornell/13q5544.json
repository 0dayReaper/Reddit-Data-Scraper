            "comment": "So this was on LinkedIn, not Handshake. But I applied to few internships and sent a follow-up message after a week expressing my interest to the hiring manager. A few days later, one reached back out to schedule an interview. It certainly helps to send a follow-up message of interest if it's an opportunity you truly want. :)\n\nIn my follow-up messages, I was authentic. Expressed my passion in my field of interest, and explained why I would benefit the company in this position. Ended it with a confident \"I look forward to hearing more about this opportunity!\" :D Please don't use ChatGPT for this haha. Use your own voice!\n\nAnother fun thing if you're feeling ballsy: I sent a direct message on LinkedIn to a CEO of my favorite company ever (I used to work there) and now I have a meeting with him to discuss an internship for next summer lmao. Try it out ;D\n\nShoot your shot. The worst that could happen is that they say no :) then ya move on to the next one!",

During an ambush several rounds hit the Humvee I was driving, one of the rounds hit the beer box and the back half of the box caught on fire. This pissed off the Iraqis because I had a beer box. They threw rocks at the Humvee, and a couple of them hit the beer box, and I was able to toss the box out of the back and the next thing I knew the Iraqis were running away. The fire in the box was knocked out in the process, but I had a full, cold beer.",

In my hometown, we have annual parades for the police, firefighters, EMTS, and here they have weekly protests to yell \"Fuck the Police\". \n\nDon't forget the Abolish the CUPD movement too, the SA voting to disarm the police, and all the other anti-police sentiment which is mainstream on campus.",

And brown and columbia and some other schools also had bomb threats that day or maybe that weekend (yale had one two days before). I think the ones that happened on sunday our working theory is there was some guy on twitter that was trying to get the attention of some cam girl and thats why he did it but i dont think anyone official confirmed thats true yet",

    "postText": "Going to slope day and seeing everyone with their close friends hanging out, having a good time and enjoying college like theyre supposed to felt really depressing... i have a lot of friends but they're all like surface level, to the point where it feels more like acquaintances. Like they'll say hi when they see me and we'll chat, but I dont really hang out with them or get invited to things and i spend most of my free time alone.\n\nThere were multiple times in college where I thought I was a part of a friend group, but they always ended up ghosting me and stopped inviting me to things eventually. I think I'm a normal person, but when I open up to someone I think it ends up being too much.  it seems like everyone i befriend ends up at that surface level friendship state, even if we initially seem to hit it off. I'm always either alone or drifting through other people's friend groups, without any close friends of my own.\n\nI've got pretty bad social anxiety and I'm hella insecure, and I'm pretty sure most people can pick up on it, which is probably why I'm at this point. It just seems like I'm not cut out for college socially. People here seem so cool, attractive, outgoing, and even if things get stressful they still are able to enjoy their free time. I dont get how I can ever get like that. It feels really intimidating.\n\nI just feel like I'm fucked because I know making friends in college should be the easiest itll ever be.",

            "comment": "Hey so this comes up on this subreddit pretty often and you have probably read all of the 'find a club' or 'be more outgoing' type advice so I'll spare you that.\n\nMaybe instead it might be helpful to explain some of the mechanisms.\n\n1. Making a solid connection is about gratitude..behave in a way that people are grateful to have you around, and be deliberate about showing gratitude to others. Likewise, if people don't show gratitude for you, you're not going to be able to force them to, find people who appreciate you.\n\n2. Going from acquaintances to friends is unnatural by definition so someone needs to make the step to invite the other person to do something more than what you would do with an acquaintance. It's okay if they say no, I invite people along all the time. If you have a good time they're probably going to say yes to invites a whole bunch in the future.\n\n3. Yes college is a good time to make friends, but this school like runs you into the ground, even compared to other high performing schools. People can just be busy, and then they feel guilty about like not doing stuff so you drift apart. I legit schedule hangout times with ppl cuz otherwise it's going to fill up with something else. Don't take it personally and hang in there.\n\n  \n\n\nSources, Visserman et al 2021, never eat alone (book), others idk I'm on mobile",

I just learn to appreciate knowing these ppl and enjoy the occasional hangouts with them. You can't force a friendship, so I just believe when it happens it happens. If you still have a few semesters left in college, just try to get *consistently* involved in some clubs/groups and reach out to ppl more for study sessions or lunches. Even if it doesn't work out in the end, there's still a whole new journey in front of you out of college, and for sure there will be more opportunities to form new relationships.",

Do that a few times then from there u can study with that person, get lunch, whatever, then u suggest the idea of a study group for ur class and u can get more ppl involved by repeating this process. Eventually u have 4-5 friends. The trick is to do this with major classes/ppl with a related major cuz u will be taking a lot of classes together during ur time in undergrad. Also, going back to the first point, if someone rejects u outright and doesn\u2019t say something like \u201csorry i can\u2019t but we shld go next time\u201d drop it and move on to the next person. U shld try max of 2 times per person before moving on. Make sure to get their insta or sum and y\u2019all can send memes back and forth boom instant friends.",

            "comment": "I think the issue youre having is developing genuine relationships. That sort of explains why these people were lukewarm towards you; it was a combination of them not being compatable + you're own  \"lack of ability\" to get close with them. I add that last part because in my first two years of college I experienced this severely . I was in a friend group yet didn't  feel close to anyone and ended up spending alot of time alone. What changed for me was going to therapy. You'll notice there's a huge social benefit to getting in touch with yourself; it becomes easier developing deeper, freer bonds with others which lead to great friendships.",

Everyone expects to be the one asked to hang out, and it's due to our own insecurities that we don't. Popular people are popular, generally, because they forego that insecurity and take the initiative to make friends.",

            "comment": "Here are some things that definitely helped me\n\n1. Quality over quantity. My freshman year, I spread myself too thin and tried to join too many circles and there was just a lack of genuine connection. Try to find 1-2 groups that fit your vibe the best and try to spend more time with them.\n2. Joining clubs that put a focus on a positive culture. It can't just be any club, but clubs that have fams or socials are good because even if you don't become friends with everyone, theres still a chance to get to hang out with people during the socials or make smaller groups of friends within the org.\n3. Find opportunities to hang out with people when they are hanging out with their friends too. I have met a lot of awesome people through friends of friends, so if people are studying or getting lunch together in groups, even if I don't know my friend's friends, I will still go to try to get to know them.",

Social aspect can either mean drinking and partying OR just chilling and having a good time with your friends without feeling pressured in any way.

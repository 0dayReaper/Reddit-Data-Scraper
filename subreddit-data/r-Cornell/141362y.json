    "postText": "I understand that you want to do well in classes, and that a 4.0 is nice... but I feel like I'm missing something greater. In high school it made sense to want to shoot for a super high GPA to make it into college, but in college, I feel like as long as I learn the things I'm passionate about to a high degree, I'll do very well in the work force and eventually my GPA (and probably my degree too) won't matter any more.\n\nNow I understand stress regarding failing a class, as that has a monetary repercussion, but why is there stress about maintaining anything above say, a B+, are there like things you lose access to without a high GPA. Like I feel confident in my ability to pass every class I am projected to take for my major, but it would take exponentially more work in order to perfect A's out of every class, but is that something that is worth doing. I remember regretting not working as hard in freshman year because I realized it would hurt my chances with college, but are there reasons to put in the same effort in college? I would rather join clubs, do research, and meet people instead if it is not that important.\n\nI'm an incoming student so this is more of a question than anything.\n\nEDIT: i am an engineer, and have a lot of real world experience and am using college as a way to solidify my knowledge before i continue work. \n\nEDIT2: i\u2019m not saying that i won\u2019t try to get A\u2019s, but i guess i\u2019m having trouble understanding why people get stressed about not having 4.0s when it doesn\u2019t seem to cut you off from much besides maybe grad school.",

            "comment": "Grad school - this doesn't require straight As, but a lot of programs require at least a 3.5 before they give you the time of day, which requires earning at least 1 A- per B+. A lot of programs have an average accepted gpa of even higher than that (3.8+), especially if it's ultra competitive like law or med school. \n\nOther than that, there's really not that much point. Personally, I find that I won't learn anything if I don't at least try for an A (it's crazy how little I can actually understand and still do ok in a class), but I'm also not the type to study a ton, so that's that.",

Additionally, parents will also get on your case about not having a good GPA (even though FERPA makes it so they can't legally get the information, they will still exert their power as your parents and demand to see it).

Any aspiring lawyers, dentists, physicians, physician assistants, veterinarians, researchers, etc. need to care abt GPA for that reason.\n\nSome other opportunities that may be GPA-locked are the study abroad opportunities, where highly competitive universities abroad like Oxford and Cambridge and LSE can be just as strenuous a process to get into as grad school.\n\nIf you intend for Cornell undergrad to be the end of your studies though you\u2019re probably fine if you keep above a 3.0. Some annoying stuff starts happening if you fall below the 3.0 mark or especially the 2.75 mark. Resume advice online will frequently tell people to not list their GPA on their resume at all if it is below 3.5, and with a few years of experience GPA becomes entirely irrelevant.",

Many firms practically require it for upward movement after a few years though, plenty of people at my firm are sponsored and go to HBS/GSB. MBB also commonly pays for it. I agree that the value proposition is lower if you land a great job out of UG, simultaneously I think Wharton isn\u2019t populated by a majority of people who do Big 4 Audit. \n\nSeems like a waste of time to me so I\u2019ll likely lateral into somewhere that cares less about the graduate degree although a two year vacation sounds nice.",

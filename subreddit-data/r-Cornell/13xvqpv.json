There's no need to rub it in current freshmen's faces or make less fortunate upperclassmen seethe in jealousy as they think back to what could have been.\n\nFuck. You. You fucking sociopath. I hope your air conditioner breaks so you get the chance to experience the older dorms. I hope you get put in the gothics if you ever stay on West Campus. I hope housing emails you, \"Sorry, we made a slight mistake with your assignment. You're living in Low Rise 6. Make sure you packed 17 fans so you don't get heat stroke.\"\n\nEdit: Wow. No one understands sarcasm. Sad I have to point it out explicitly.",

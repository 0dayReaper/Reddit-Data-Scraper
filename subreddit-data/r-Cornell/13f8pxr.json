    "postText": "I came across a post on another site about a transfer student who got a \"C\" on a course that was required for his major. He said he was told to retake the course for an \"A\". I got a C this semester on the second part of the course for my major. The transfer options were told they needed a B and a 3.5 overall, but the website for my major says a C for transfer credits. It doesn't make sense that OP had to retake the course. I'm pretty sure students in Cornell who get a C in a required course don't have to retake it for an A or B. Does anyone have experience with this as a transfer option? I'm wondering if I need to tell someone about this asap or just wait to see if they will accept the C on my transcript... my GPA is likely a 3.2 or 3.3, still waiting for my last grade to come in. Thanks!",

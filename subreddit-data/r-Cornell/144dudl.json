    "postText": "Anyone who is an info sci major, I was wondering if its a good idea to take Info 2450: Communication and Technology.\n\nFor some background, I'm a rising sophomore and I haven't taken any info classes but I'm thinking of majoring in info sci. The other classes I'm taking next semester are CS 1110, a stats class, a marketing class for my business minor, and a history class. Do you think the work load will be too much? Should take another info class instead?\n\nAlso just about info in general: do you think its worth it? What kind of careers can you pursue afterwards?\n\nThank you for your help! : )",

            "comment": "2450 and 1200 are easily the two lowest workload classes in the InfoSci major core. 1300 is tedious and 2040 and 2950 are technical. In recent semesters however it\u2019s been taught by professor Yu who introduced a \u201cWow factor\u201d to the grading\u2014extremely arbitrary and frustrating. I found 1200 to be the more compelling and fun course between the two because of the differences between the professors and course management, despite 2450\u2019s content aligning more with my interests. Also, btw if you\u2019re taking that History class to fulfill a distribution requirement you should know that 2450 and 1200 fulfill distribution reqs themselves, so you could be safe to drop that course.\n\nAs for the InfoSci major itself, here\u2019s my personal take:\n\nIf you\u2019re in it to do Data Science, please do yourself a big favor and transfer into the Statistical Science major instead. It will save you so much headache and frustration when you realize just how intensely analytical Data Science really is, and when you\u2019re eventually applying to graduate schools in Computer Science, Statistics, or Data Science because over 90% of all employed Data Scientists have a graduate degree. The InfoSci DataSci concentration will absolutely not cut it on its own, and I know because I\u2019m one class away from qualifying for it and I have never taken so much as a calculus-based statistics course, much less any of the gorey mathematics and statistics Data Scientists need to get things done. ISST is probably stronger than pure InfoSci for this due to its ORIE and higher CS reqs but honestly, just do some combination of CS, Stats, ORIE as major/minor or double major and you\u2019ll be so much better off, you can take INFO DataSci electives from within those other majors instead.\n\nIf you\u2019re in it to do Software Engineering, you\u2019re not in a bad place, but you should seriously consider whether doing Computer Science would be worth it to you. If it is within your ability and you are absolutely set on doing SWE, having a CS degree will make your life easier. \n\nFor people unfamiliar with the Cornell program, InfoSci is associated with business/IT.\nThis is because at many colleges it\u2019s a major offered by the business school and which consists of either intro computing and help desk or business management with some programming. For people vaguely familiar with the Cornell program, InfoSci can be seen as \u201cCS but easier\u201d. Either way, you\u2019ll be fighting to prove your worth more than the more universally recognized CS degree holders would, and you may be filtered out of a few opportunities where hiring managers are very strict about only wanting to hire CS majors. The benefit of doing InfoSci over CS is it\u2019s much more flexible, much friendlier to interdisciplinary pursuits, and can absolutely save your life from the stress and misery that CS\u2019s intensity can inflict. I\u2019ve known people who switched because doing CS was wrecking their mental health and GPA, and they don\u2019t regret it at all. IS majors still regularly get SWE positions at even the best places, and they have more time to work on projects and extracurriculars. Plus you get to smell better at interviews :p\n\nIf you\u2019re in InfoSci for UX Design, you\u2019re in the very best place you can be. IMO this is the strongest reason to want to switch into IS, because no other major fits this career path so well. The UX program at Cornell is highly ranked and places well in industry, and the professors are all wonderful people. Cornell InfoSci has a great alumni network of UI/UX Designers and I\u2019ve encountered a few randomly in UX online spaces. UX students are generally much less technical than their CS-adjacent peers, but the major\u2019s UX offerings can still be very beneficial to an aspiring SWE who wants a stronger foundation in human computer interaction than most CS majors ever get.",

You have to mix in more stats and math than required, Lin alg and just more cs classes at least. I\u2019m slowly but surely figuring it out myself but regret not doing Orie.\n\nFor context I also worked for 3 years managing businesses and being an executive manager and ta\u2019Ed into to data science and still feel like I\u2019m getting snubbed\n\nFor people that I studied IS with that got data science job (1 out of like 7) they did a cs minor, most of a physics minor, and did legit projects, worked at a legit firm, and started a company at Cornell",

            "comment": "2450 is a total BS class. It is nearly zero workload so it will fit into your schedule fine, but it\u2019s also not necessarily an easy A and in my opinion it was not very interesting. I don\u2019t think it would be a good test for whether you\u2019re interested in info sci.\n\nFor a better intro to infosci, I would suggest 1200/1260 or 2040! 1260 was the first info class I took and I think it was discontinued, but 1200 is in my opinion more interesting and more \u201cinfosci\u201d than 2450. 2040 is also pretty easy, not too much of a time commitment, and would serve as a good introduction to the major.\n\nI love infosci because I feel like you can do anything with it as long as you do some interview prep! I was able to snag a data science internship while I was a student in 2950. I will say that you shouldn\u2019t expect to get a job at a big name company (I.e. google apple) with infosci alone, but you will definitely get a job. Like the commenter above, I\u2019d suggest taking extra technical classes/minors if you\u2019re going for a more technical job. But it\u2019s a pleasant and easy major that makes you pretty marketable and multifaceted which is great. I really recommend!!!! But if the prestige of your future career is your main priority (personally I am very happy to work at a random ass company as long as I like the culture and pay) then maybe go somewhere else depending on your interests",

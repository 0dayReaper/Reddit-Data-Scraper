    "postText": "Forget about classes moving online, forget about the in-person semester being over for everyone, forget about the vital research this university conducts being put on hold, forget about students being forced to return to shitty home environments, even forget about at-risk people dying.  These are things we talk about all the time and if it\u2019s somehow not enough to keep you out of a fucking annex, then please consider the people who rely on Cornell for employment.\n\nBecause the fact of the matter is, a few more events by \u201cunnamed parties\u201d gone wrong, and literally hundreds if not thousands of people here are unemployed OVERNIGHT.  Yes UNEMPLOYED.  Without jobs, without a stream of income, a.k.a. something necessary to feed, clothe, and house oneself when one\u2019s parents do not do so.  The people who work in the dining halls to serve you the food you eat every day, the people who clean the classroom floors where you thoughtlessly dump your Canada goose jackets (yes I\u2019ve seen kids just throw them on the ground), the people who clean the dorm bathrooms for you, the people who do maintenance around campus.  All those people will be without jobs, at least until February, perhaps much longer if Cornell has to permanently lay people off to cover for the money they are hemorrhaging.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Cornell employees, its the countless small business owners, many of whom are immigrants without a backup plan, who have been staying open by the skin of their teeth betting on this semester\u2019s success.  It\u2019s the uber and Lyft drivers who ferry you around town, and it\u2019s the families of all these people.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if any of you have ever taken the opportunity to *really* look around during your time here, but Ithaca, New York is not a hotbed of economic opportunity by any stretch of the imagination.  There aren\u2019t a lot of entry-level jobs floating around for these people to turn to if things go south, especially not this year.  If these people lose their income, because of you, yes YOU, there are a lot of fucking consequences.  Some of them might lose their homes, their cars, their savings.  Some might not have savings.  If they have kids, those kids might now *eat* less because of YOU.  Those kids might not get Christmas presents this year because of YOU.  Those kids might now helplessly watch their parents suffer from depression because of YOU.  Newsflash, unemployment takes a toll on the mental health Cornell students love to bitch about a hell of a lot more than prelims (see this helpful link [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coping-with-unemployment/art-20485976](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coping-with-unemployment/art-20485976)).\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, but a lot of our dining hall employees are not young people, and if they lose these jobs, not only will their retirement saving stop, but they may need to dip into those savings to support themselves, delaying their retirement indefinitely because YOU couldn\u2019t follow the rules.  These people are a part of our community just as much as any student is. I\u2019ll fucking die on that hill.  Most of them will be here or have been here longer than any of us, and they will be working here after we\u2019re gone.  They are definitely more so a part of Cornell than certain unnamed fucking frosh who have already busted in here like they own the place.\n\nYou interact with them on a daily basis, you recognize them, they make everything run, they work incredibly hard, they smile and give you words of encouragement and fucking feed you.  If the campus shuts down, they do not go back to Westchester or Long Island or Miami or Manhattan.  You are indebted to them, you owe it to them to do everything you can to keep this semester alive.\n\nWhat is a bummer of a semester for you, has potentially ENORMOUS implications for the lives of our staff here, and the college town community as a whole.  How dare you. How dare any of you forget about what is at stake for them this Fall.\n\nTL;DR: If the semester ends, Cornell employees and business owners around here are going to get put in a very rough place, and it\u2019s hard to watch people disregard that.",

Sometimes people focus so much on how the shut down can personally affect them but forget how it affects other people\u2019s lives too.\n\nThank you for bringing this perspective and let\u2019s hope more people really reflect on this. Hope they follow the guidelines and wear a mask.",

Retirement payments were reduced for a year for employees of the endowed part of the university and pay was cut for employees of the statutory part of the university to help make up the budget shortfall.  So those friendly helpful people assisting and teaching you this semester are being compensated less than they were last year.",

Many people were encouraged to retire early. We've all been working like mad the entire summer to come up with plans, back up plans, and back up back up plans (at the minimum) to make this a successful semester for you. I know I'm not alone in already feeling burnt out because I spent my entire summer \"vacation\" in faculty meetings preparing for the fall (and also recovering from Covid). For any of your teachers who are adjuncts, like many of my colleagues in my department, pay--which was already tough to survive on in Ithaca--has dipped even lower. We care SO much about providing you with a great education despite these difficult circumstances. Please don't make it harder. Or scarier.",

Until Cornell actually expels someone for this reckless behavior, the partying won\u2019t stop. Also the fact that many off campus students haven\u2019t been tested for a second time since they arrived in July is problematic.  I\u2019m not sure what Cornell was thinking with that one when they were so busy testing and retesting kids in dorms. Non hotspot state students should have also been required to quarantine for two weeks instead of just been encouraged as for all we know they brought it here. You also have the ones who claim they quarantined but didn\u2019t and never had to show any proof of such quarantine. \n\nWhile I agree if Cornell closes lots of jobs will be lost and boy Ithaca needs it. Ithaca Mall is a ghost town, closed stores and restaurants galore, the commons is pretty lame right now too, but I think they\u2019re very far from closing. The 100 case threshold is to go online for 2 weeks only,  not close and send home. I also think they spent way too much money on this to throw in the towel. We are not UNC. We are not SUNY Oneoneta. If online the dining halls still need to feed thousands of students. Staff are needed. The mail rooms are overloaded maybe workers can be shifted. \n\nBut the bottom line really is people grow up and if you can\u2019t, get the hell out of Ithaca so that those who really want to be here have a fighting chance. Otherwise you will kill many college hopes as well as an economy not to mention stuck living back with your parents.",

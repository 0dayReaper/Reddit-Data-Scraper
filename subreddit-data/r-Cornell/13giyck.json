Also, the current SB contract isn't supposed to end until 2025 which would involve Cornell continuing to support them for the next 2.5 years which was the whole point of the demonstration in the first place.",

There's a power differential that can't be overcome no matter how nice your PI is because stochastically each unit within the system can't see how their choices \\*indirectly\\* results in treating each other unfairly, which is why collective bartering is able to even the playing field.\n\nAs nice as it would be for admins to design the university policy from behind a veil of ignorance it is too efficient to change things up, so this is a good step in the right direction.",

I have more sympathy for labor activism when the work is difficult, not making frappuccinos. I feel like the Ithaca Starbucks strike had awful optics and was primarily run by Cornell students who wanted labor or political clout and corporate made a decision to close the stores because it just wasn't worth dealing with.\n\nThus, it's pretty hard to bring myself to care either way. Starbucks has shit coffee so frankly I wouldn't miss it though.",

            "comment": "Some clarification from an organizer of the campaign/occupation!\n\nRemaining SB stores in Ithaca are all licensed through the \u201cProudly Serving Starbucks\u201d program\u2014 the company profits from multi-year licensing contracts, not the actual coffee sold. Starbucks closed all of its corporate locations in Ithaca (CTown, Commons, Meadows) but didn\u2019t end any of their Ithaca licensing agreements (Cornell dining halls, most cafes, plus Target and Barnes and Noble). Our campaign targets the latter, calling for an end to the Cornell contracts.\n\nOur opinion isn\u2019t really that the loss in profits from Cornell will directly impact Starbucks that much \u2014 by closing all of their stores in Ithaca, the company has effectively conceded that they don\u2019t care if they make money in Ithaca. Rather, extracting a commitment to swap vendors sets a precedent that pro-union activists at universities and other organizations across the country can and should push for similar demands. Cumulatively, this changes the decision calculus for Starbucks \u2014 the longer they continue union-busting, the more of their lucrative \u201cProudly Serving\u201d contracts that they risk. College students are the core of their customer base, and what we do really does matter in their eyes.\n\n\nAs others have noted, we still want coffee on campus \u2014 we\u2019re just asking admin to work with us to find a more ethical alternative. The important part right now is committing that it won\u2019t be Starbucks. Corporate alternatives are obviously far from labor utopias, though we think local unionized cooperative Gimme should also be on the table (two years is plenty of time to scale up), but Starbucks has screwed over Ithaca individually and has racked up more federal Unfair Labor Practice charges than any other corporation in history. There need to be consequences, and this is one avenue for that.\n\nI know the Ithaca workers and they\u2019re brave, incredible people who are cornerstones of the broader Ithaca community. Those people have been suddenly laid off after over a year of being specifically targeted by a multi-national corporation. I feel our campaign is an effective way to show our support for them in a situation where they have very little power.",

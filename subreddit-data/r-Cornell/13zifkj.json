Tho I\u2019m not sure if research experience matters as much for CS MS??\n\nWould greatly appreciate it if someone would spill the tea on what helped them with their CS grad apps!\n\nThank you!!!",

            "comment": "Hey there! Current CS MS ('24) and former CS undergrad ('20) here, so I can give some insight on Cornell's CS MS program (which is #7 according to US News but is also fully funded).\n\nI think it depends on a few factors:\n- 3.5-3.6 GPA is around the minimum of where a strong applicant should be. GPA tends not to be the thing that gets you in (i.e. trying to optimize for GPA alone isn't beneficial), but instead the thing that might knock you off the list. I applied with a 3.7, which is probably \"fine enough\".\n- Some MS programs value TA experience highly. If you're able to TA in a course well enough for your prof to remember you and write a TA recommendation, that would be a solid mark in your favor (this basically happened to me). Cornell's MS program explicitly looks for strong TAs.\n- Research experience is a good idea, but you want to make sure that you do well enough in research to get strong recommendations, or to at least have a strong SOP and recommendation letters that can carry you over the threshold. A publication would be best, but I got in twice (once in '20 when the pandemic hit and I chose to work, and again in '22 when I worked in industry) without \"good\" research experience or publications, but with a good enough SOP, a vision for what I wanted to work on (computer vision in this case), relevant practical experience in graduate-level classes and project teams and recommendations that helped me get there. \n\nI think the big insights are (at least for Cornell's program):\n- Get good research and TA experiences. For research especially, it probably helps to have a clear idea of what you want to do, and to try to get class or practical experience in the field beforehand so you can hit the ground running. Grad-level classes (6000+) can be ideal to get this exposure, and many grad-level classes have \"research-like work\" as the final project (i.e. you'd write a research paper on a novel-ish topic in the format of major conferences).\n- Get good recommendation letters from profs, ideally by doing well at research and teaching\n- Improve your GPA but don't stress over maximizing it (3 semesters should be enough time to have some marginal improvement. I graduated in 3 years, ended my first year with a 3.5, and ended my last with a 3.7). Doing research or teaching for credit can help, since it will both let you not have to split your time between research and classes and help motivate you to put your best foot forward.\n- If you don't think you're ready for a research MS, but want to give yourself some optionality at least here, many people I know have done an M.Eng and transferred to an MS by doing strong research with professors during the M.Eng and having good recommendations.",

Inventory is limited, prices are inflated, and the stealerships like McGuire are predatory.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go to Cortland or preferably Syracuse where you'll actually have some decent selection. \n\nIf you need to stay local though, check out ridge road imports which is known to be an unflinchingly honest dealer. I have had repair work done there and they were exceptional. Ask for Elliot.",

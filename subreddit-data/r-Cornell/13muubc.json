I\u2019m wondering how do I make friends to hang out with over the summer when there seems to be nobody on campus? And what are things to do besides exploring the gorges and nature",

I spoke to someone at Brown Cat Rescue who said that I could tell them exactly what I'm looking to foster and they would provide me with food, litter, and pay all confirmed vet expenses. \n\nYou can foster young kittens and they will usually give you 2 kittens that are too young to be adopted. I have taken care of a litter of 5 kittens that needed to be bottlefed before. Your job is just to care for them and get them socialized and ready to be adopted when they're old enough. You can also foster an older cat if you'd like. Adult cats can take longer to be adopted, so you might be living with your cat all year, keeping it out of a cage at a shelter and giving it a better chance of being adopted. The commitment usually ends when your kittens/cat are adopted, or in this case if you are leaving Ithaca.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

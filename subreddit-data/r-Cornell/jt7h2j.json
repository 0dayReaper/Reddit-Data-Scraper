    "postText": "Cornell's administration is currently in the process of totally overhauling the Student Code of Conduct. These changes will fundamentally alter your rights if you are ever accused of violating the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe rights we will lose:\n\n1. Cross-examination (in almost all circumstances)\n2. Right to a public hearing\n3. The \"clear and convincing evidence\" burden of proof\n4. Participation of independent counselors\n\nThe Administration is justifying these changes under the guise of making the code \"less legalistic\" and \"less adversarial\". When pressed on this, representatives defended their claims by stating \"lawyers are frightening\" and through vague statements about it \"being in the interest of the community\".\n\nChanging the the burden of proof from \"clear and convincing evidence\" to \"preponderance of the evidence\" makes it significantly more likely innocent students are found in violation of the Code of Conduct. \"Preponderance of the evidence\" is best explained as \"more likely than not\", or a 51% chance you are guilty. Because the University only requires a 3/5 majority to find a student responsible, the addition of \"preponderance of the evidence\" means that only 3 out of 5 members of the Hearing Board need to be 51% sure that you committed the violation you are accused of. This is incredibly dangerous.\n\nIf you want to read more about the changes you can read the new code here: [https://assembly.cornell.edu/get-involved/input-issues/fall-2020-proposed-amendments-campus-code-conduct](https://assembly.cornell.edu/get-involved/input-issues/fall-2020-proposed-amendments-campus-code-conduct)\n\nFor the sake of brevity (and because they are more self-explanatory), I've avoided long-winded explanations of the other rights that are on-the-line. I'm happy to clarify those if folks want me to.",

It did appear that they were willing to consider keeping the current standard of evidence and allowing counselors to have a larger role (although not to the degree they are currently allowed).\n\nIt is disgraceful that Administration is using the pandemic and claims that the current process is \"too adversarial\" (which by they mean too scary) as an excuse to limit our rights.\n\nEdit: Holy shit I should start proof-reading my comments on here. I don't know how I manage to make so many errors lmao",

You can still defend yourself with the new code. \n\nSeriously, you guys are acting like you're gonna get kicked out for no reason. You'll get kicked out if you cheat, and it should be this way. There is way too much of a culture of people cheating on homework regularly and relying on their friends to get through classes. What does this lead to?

Are there even enough cases to generate any meaningful statistics? If we want to keep our 40% cheating rate constant, in fear of increasing falsely accused rate from 1/10000 to 1/5000, this is complete insanity and nonsense. If people can construct any meaningful evidence based argument that I'm wrong, I'll happily change my opinion. But as it stands, it seems to me the change is hurting cheaters, and having a neglible effect on everyone else. I can't understand why people are against it.",

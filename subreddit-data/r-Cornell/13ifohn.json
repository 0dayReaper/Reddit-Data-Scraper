    "postText": "Does anyone know if lectures for this class are recorded/posted at all? Also, is attendance recorded? I want to take the class but just realized I have something that would conflict with one of the three lectures each week and I really wanna do both but I'm not sure how feasible it would be. I'm also not too worried about actual material I've taken all the prereqs and then some but I just don't want to lose points for not attending some of the classes in person.... Thanks !!!",

This is all speculation. I don't think I have ever seen a TCAT bus go up or down Buffalo St as a regular route. I vaguely remember TCAT buses going down Seneca St in the Summer of 2018 when a lane on State St was closed for construction. Shortline also used State and Stewart from what I remember before March 2020. Also, Stewart Ave has one of the few bridges that connects different parts of the campus.",

Just admit that Ithaca doesn't have everything going on and that that's fine. Ithaca is a very charming town that is actually ahead of the curve in many ways in terms of limited sprawl and high transit ridership. Compared to other cities its size, it's great. But it's not going to compete with NYC or even Syracuse in some aspects (like seriously, there's one concert venue in Ithaca and its seats only).\n\n\nAlso don't forget that Ithaca is basically in a long-distance transit desert with the exception of Greyhound and Ourbus.",

Our city does all this stuff to cater to Cornell and in return we get a bunch of people talking smack about us. I think we're allowed to find that a bit irritating. Ithaca's not a perfect place. There's loads of stuff to complain about (expensive housing, empty storefronts owned by absentee landlords who charge too much, etc.), but I can't deny that it feels crappy to see this kind of view of the town from folks who often don't really try to engage with it while simultaneously benefitting from its largest institution. I don't think all Cornell students are whiny rich kids (I'm also a student and I only WISH that I could be a whiny rich kid), but you can't deny that there is an element of disconnect between students and the town and it isn't just because we are all negative jerk townies here.\n\nAlso, I was calling Ithaca gay, not students.

That coupled with the new batch of students getting stuck inside due to covid restrictions and never getting to go out to explore what ithaca has to offer is just breeding ground for resentment. Once both sides resent each other it sort of becomes a nasty cycle breeding more resentment.",

So they do the right thing (ok, it\u2019s mandated, but still), they have a dramatically dumbed down college experience and all they get from the locals is that they are superficial, entitled assholes. Cornell should build more housing for students and let the supply and demand problem sort itself out with the locals. As it stands, there is a lack of empathy.

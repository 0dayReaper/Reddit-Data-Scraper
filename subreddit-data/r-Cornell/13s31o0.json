You can ride for most of fall semester (though it gets  cold) and only maybe the last month of spring semester. The motorcycle pass isn\u2019t that expensive, though in my experience I\u2019ve never gotten a ticket with my bike, but there are plenty of motorcycle parking spots around campus. I only ride it to one spot on campus tho where I know I won\u2019t get a ticket. In the spring the Ithaca area is really nice to ride around",

            "comment": "In ancient times,  a motorcycle was an optimal way to get around campus.   Every building had a mini \"M\" lot nearby and the \"M\" permit was inexpensive.   I understand this has changed.\n\nIn winter we parked our motorcycles inside the front door of  our rental house at 106 highland place.   Famed slumlord Gus objected but seemed impressed due to the glaring engineering talent required to get two motorcycles up the stairs and inside.",

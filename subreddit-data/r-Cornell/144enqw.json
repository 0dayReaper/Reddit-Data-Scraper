Cornell Minds matter is a student-run organization with tons of funding that literally just run events to keep the students happy. the dean's office has a lot of people put in place for that, and i've seen the crisis workers first hand and how incredible and empathetic they are to a lot of things.\n\ni think that the culture itself is very hard on the student body, but i have had multiple conversations with faculty about the importance of rigor and the feeling that we are accommodating too much or too far. to be honest, the hardest/harshest feelings came from zeitgeisty feelings rather than real ones, as most my student peers/friends were usually very cool but it seemed as if we were... fighting against prejudice if you will?\n\ni'm not sure if admin is moving in the right direction by being more helicopter-y or not. the nets were the beginning of a more authoritative administration that feels, for example, that sophomores should live in dorms (which i adamantly oppose). a prof told me recently that 30% of the students in her big lectures just don't show up because they are now \"afraid of crowds, and lecture is overwhelming\".\n\ntbh, cornell and everyone seems to want to just forget 6 million people died and the world kind of did not end, but did change. there's lots of damage that is in there on top of all the issues cornell had before covid. if i were in any position of authority, i'd increase the number of available therapists to the student body (maybe creating online therapy models for CUHealth like talkiatry?) to ensure healthy outcomes.",

I had been dealing with mental health issues long before my time at Cornell, so I thought I could \u201chandle it\u201d on my own, and never took care of Cornell\u2019s resources.\n\nIn terms of the rigor, I was in a design program, which are notorious for having very high expectations in terms of amount of time and effort spent on coursework. Students who didnt eat sleep and live in studio were sort of looked down upon by faculty, and any pushback from students was seen as being lazy. I\u2019m not sure how the  culture has changed in that department in a post pandemic world",

            "comment": "Giving benefit of the doubt:\n\nAs much as I appreciate that this can be done in good faith with a positive spin on the aftermath of your experience, I believe that if your goal is to impress onto others the importance of mental health and self care all while welcoming them to the cornell community, your post is structured poorly.\n\nFirstly, your title reduces all of your experiences to a single horrible and evocative concept. For some reason you not only chose to express that you attempted suicide, but that you also chose a manner that would almost certainly leave an individual with a sense of horror... jumping into a rocky gorge isn't exactly a peaceful or graceful way to depart this life. From the get go you've superimposed the manner of your attempted suicide soley onto Cornell, with little more to speak about your time there (aside from a minor complaint about both CUPD and safety, which is discouraging)... all of that is peculiar when keeping in mind that the vast majority of people wouldn't even consider your title an option. \n\nMoreover, you hardly lament the action. You give no exposition into the importance of taking care of one's self. Most of your rhetoric is regarding you, you, and you. What you feel is important(described very vaguely), how you are helping others, and that you were the victim of being given \"the runaround\"... somthing I'm not actually sure how to receive. Should an authority jump at the prospect of giving somebody who demonstrated mental instability a soap box? How can people assume what you have to say is beneficial to them? \n\nBenefit of the doubt away:\n\nIt's hard not take this post as somebody's avenue thorough parsing what they've been through in life, validating it, and achieving meaning. However, the meaning that you say you want is hardly achieved when you go about it this way. Simply saying \"I had it as bad as it gets, but I made it out in the end\", gives both a sense of hope without the visceral image of suicide coupled with that being the your only notable experience that was initially shared. You forced your audience into a bottleneck of thought with how they may receive your message... and it's hardly one that highlights positivity, welcome, or good intentions/virtue. \n\nIt's not good for a community, nor its prospective new members, for people to haphazardly and tactlessly describe the single worst experience of their lives without relevant context or some sense of hope/goodness on the back end. What you say and how you say it has an impact on others, and you should be very careful about unilaterally deciding how what you're saying and how you're saying it is good for them. It's even worse when it comes across, albeit this being my opinion, as a selfish message with a projected agenda rather than true community outreach. \n\n18 year old me recieves this at best as: ah its bad that you had a bad experience, how's your cat? My middle of the road interpretation would still be colored negatively and probably leave me confused as to why I keep seeing so much talk on suicide on this subreddit... not aware that this is an issue that is still very rare and does not reflect the everyday life of most students. \n\nAnd of course the worst interpretation from an inbound18 year-old goes pretty far down the rabbit hole imto taking notes/realizing they may take more drastic measures to ensure a complete suicide if even jumping into the gorge doesn't work.\n\nUltimately you're free to discuss whatever it is you want, just as I'm free to share my opinion... but I'd urge you to be alot more thoughtful of how you approach this in open conversation. Specifically I would urge you to really consider if your stated aim is truly aligned with your chosen message and language. \n\nGl out there.",

I don't intend to respond to you point by point, but I will say one thing.. it was once my job to be the primary care provider for ~330 active duty military members, both at sea and ashore. During this time it was my job to care for those with mental health issues, including depression/suicidal ideation. If it appears to you that I don't \"know what I'm talking about\" you'd probably be wrong.. and perhaps it'd be worth thinking you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. Suicidal behavior isn't unheard of, but it is in fact rare.. even at Cornell. Last I checked, we were at about 2x the national avg (per capita measurements) which is absolutely not beyond the realm of reason for one of the most rigorous academic institutions on the planet. Moreover, bouts of attempted suicide and depression are actually \"contagious\". Call it a sociological, psychological or some other phenomenon, it is real. A member of a group committing suicide is well documented to be positively cooralated with following attempted suicide within that same community. There is a difference between increasing awareness for mental health/depression vs language behavior that constitutes a stimulus in this phenomenon. That's somthing you should be aware of.",

I think I\u2019m doing ok with that given the circumstances.\nThe stress from that left some cPTSD I still deal with. Lots of triggers, there\u2019s days life just feels like a minefield! But a lot of therapy has helped. Petting cats, chasing dogs, hugging toddlers, lots of good food and good sex.\n\nAs for the fractures\u2026.I mean I will never run a marathon :) but I\u2019ll dance my ass off at my wedding as long as I find wedding shoes that will allow my heel raise?",

CUPD reached out to find out where i had gotten in and found camera footage of me walking the bridge. i mean, this was followed through as well as you could with a girl in a hospital for six weeks.",

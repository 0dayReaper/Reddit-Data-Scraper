I can't dedicate time or energy to work and I've considered dropping out many times because it really is too much. I can't find it in me anymore to even look for a job and sometimes I just want to give up on everything\n\nThis note was pretty sobering. I didn't realize I might regret giving up on my dream that much later in life. I thought everything would be fine if I could be with the person I wanted to be. I feel like I've already started to feel the regret this person feels and I'm scared that this will be the rest of my life",

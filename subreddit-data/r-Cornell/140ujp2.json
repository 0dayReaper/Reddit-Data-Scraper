            "comment": "Hi! Depending on the major, it is pretty common to need to retake one or two intro courses, especially if the topics aren't quite interesting enough for you. I can at least confirm this for CALS and Engineering. These intro courses are designed to be challenging, and designed to make you rethink whether you're choosing the major that will bring you long term contentment. Rethinking your major is an exciting thing! Explore around, chat with some fellow students, pop in a faculty member's office or lab and ask questions about their research, what fields can find work in that research, what their path from undergrad to PhD to a career looked like, etc. In the long run it's all about transferrable skills so don't limit yourself.\n\n\\-Chat with Faculty to get an idea of what your future career pivots could look like.  \n\\-Chat with Students to see how they determined which major was right for them.  \n\\-Chat with Major Coordinators to either create a path to graduation fitting in the course retakes, or fitting in a change of major plan. They can also tell you about any Cornell scholarships towards summer courses if you receive financial aid.  \n\\-Chat with the advising office for additional general advice, maybe on study skills?  \n\\-Chat with SDS office on extended time exams, sometimes we just need an extra 20 mins to get through the initial panic attack/blank brain for our grades to level out.  \n\\-Definitely don't skip class, and definitely go to office hours. Brownie points exist with faculty, and if they see you making the effort and they see you can understand the concepts outside of our usual exams, it goes a long way. There are no stupid questions. Plus it's a huge confidence boost to our own imposter syndromes when we can answer the \"easy\" questions.",

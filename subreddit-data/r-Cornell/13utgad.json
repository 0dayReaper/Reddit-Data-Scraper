We can contribute positively by sharing our experience and especially providing our longer term perspective to current students who may feel discouraged or hopeless.  We are older and have seen more and we can help.  I see no reason to be confined to just an alumni subreddit.\n\nNo need to lurk in shadow.  Join the discussion or even argument. We can also learn something from the young people here. \ud83d\ude0e",

I mainly hosted office hours and graded prelims, didn't have to teach or anything. I'm not sure whether MEng students do traditional TA roles or if it's reserved for PhD students.",

I had a GRA position all last year that covered tuition, student insurance, and a stipend paid twice a month, about $1,684 after taxes.\n\nI'll have a TA position for the full upcoming fall semester that covers my tuition, student health insurance, and a stipend and another TA position for the first 7 weeks of fall that is an hourly position. The difference in the two is that the hourly position is at Johnson and the stipend position is at ILR.\n\nNow, having said all that, I don't know if any of this is applicable to your grad program. So, I hope you find the info you're looking for.",

If you are not individually teaching above that threshold you don't receive a stipend but hourly pay. There is Cornell policy on this though that protects grad students, I would check that out.",

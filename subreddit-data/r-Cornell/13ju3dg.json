Either it\u2019s less than 5 hours a night for the early mornings or crashing and sleeping in past 10:00 AM\u2014it\u2019s currently almost 3:00 AM and my brain and body REFUSE to shut off\u2026\n\nConsidering just getting up and studying through what remains of the night at this point, this cycle is so old\ud83d\ude1e",

            "comment": "Hey friend, I'm way out the other side and it absolutely took me until grad school to figure out how to take care of myself. If you can manage it, I'd strongly recommend getting outside and getting some exercise. Being around nature especially makes a huge difference- schedule a half hour or an hour to walk or run in the arboretum or on the Cascadilla gorge trail. Drink water and not just coffee.\n\n I know that these things aren't the solution to everything- Cornell is incredibly hard and stressful. But they do help a ton and will make a difference!\n\nEdited to add: spending some time outside might seem like a waste of time while you're supposed to be studying, but moving your body will improve your study efficiency. Your brain is part of your body and if you're feeling antsy and stressed moving around will help a ton!",

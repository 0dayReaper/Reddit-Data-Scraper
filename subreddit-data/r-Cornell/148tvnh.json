    "postText": "1. If you are assigned to a generally perceived less desirable dorm like HRLR, Donlon or South Campus, don't expect a person assigned to top tier dorms like RBG/Hu Shih/McClintock, West Main or Ganedago/Morrison to swap room with you. *Just not going to happen*. You may as well ask them to swap your $10 bill for their Benjamins.\n2. If you are in a double/triple, again no one would give up a single for you for a dorm in the same tier.\n3. The only thing that would make that swap work is extra money.  But I am not even sure that is legal.\n4. All things being equal, no one wants to be assigned to a triple in a 1960's era dorm.  But that is life. Sometimes in life you do get the short end of the straw. Unless you have a legitimate medical reason you can't stay in your assigned dorm, deal with it.  It is only for ten months.\n5. For the record I was assigned to a zoo dorm (thankfully it had long been demolished) with a totally incompatible roommate.   We were eternal enemies by the end of freshman year. So it is not as if I didn't experience bad Cornell housing decision.",

So for argument sake, Cornell set Donlon rate as 0.9P, HRLR as .85P whereas RBG/Hu/McClintock as 1.25P.  Well, the prices will now reflect the quality of the dorm.\n\nBut then all the rich kids will occupy the newest dorms because their parents can afford the higher rate. On the other hand,  middle class and working class kids will be staying in the older dorms. The dirt poor kids will stay at the shittiest dorms. That is hard for me to accept even though I am a capitalist.\n\nSo the more equitable way is to price room types differently but not actual dorms.",

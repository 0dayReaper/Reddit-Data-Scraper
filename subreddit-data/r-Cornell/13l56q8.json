    "postText": "hi everyone, recently I was admitted off the waitlist(!!) to cornells college of engineering for bioengineering and i\u2019m literally dying in anguish trying to choose between carnegie mellon engineering and cornell coe. at cmu id likely double major in bme/ece and at cornell id just do a single be major. i\u2019ve told everyone i know i\u2019m sticking with CMU but really, i\u2019m still in crisis trying to decide between the two programs. i\u2019ve got to confess that i\u2019m leaning towards CMU, but i thought it might be helpful to find out more about cornell on this subreddit to find out what i might be missing should i choose cmu in the end.\n\nhere are some questions i have for u guys\u2026\n\n1. how is ithaca? this is my #1 concern as i am from SF and i feel i cannot survive outside an urban setting. has anyone gone to cornell with a similar mindset and had their mind changed thru spending some time at cornell?\n2. cornell\u2019s be is obviously very strong, much stronger than CMU\u2019s, but i\u2019ve heard that it tends to lean towards enviro/agri eng and away from BME. this concerns me as i\u2019m very interested in gaining a strong background in BME. how would you evaluate the relative strengths of cornell BME vs CMU BME?\n3. how is the alumni network? like in the industry and among postgrads and famous bme labs at top top unis (caltech, stanford, mit). do you see a lot of CMU people or more cornell people there? i do know cornell has somewhat of a bigger name bc of ivy status\n4. how are the maker facilities at cornell?  bc techspark does seem nice but very small and i heard it\u2019s difficult to get in if you\u2019re not a meche upperclassman. inclusive and advanced maker spaces are a must for me!!\n5. how are the dorms? bc they do look mustier than CMU\u2019s but people tell me they aren\u2019t that bad (CMU does have roaches\u2026 \ud83d\ude13)\n6. is the food as good as they say?\n7. how is student life? (scared of suicide gorges BUT people say the depression isn\u2019t nearly bad as at CMU) and is it strongly interdisciplinary, esp within coe? inter-discipline work is extremely important to me and formed a huge part of my college application.\n\nany additional insight into choosing between these two programs would be really neat and appreciated\u2026 \ud83e\udd7a\u2026 thanks!!\n\nedit for anyone seeing this: sadly i had to go with CMU in the end\u2026 i just rly liked their CompB program and the location more than Cornell, and when my PI offered to connect me to some profs and postdocs at CMU, that just made it impossible for me to say no. this was literally the hardest decision i\u2019ve made in my life and in the end i think Cornell is def a better school than CMU in many, many ways, it just ended up not being a great fit for me and my situation :p",

Alumni network is great for most engineering and everything else, not sure about BME but I'm sure the name/prestige is similar\n4. There's makerclub which has a lot of cool equipment you could use, and we also have project teams but those can also be fairly selective. If you apply for a lot you'll most likely get into one. There are a bunch of BME ones too.\n5. Dorms are great, especially for newer students, unless you get stuck in one of the older ones, but even then it isn't terrible.\n6. Food is fine, better than most campuses and a lot of options\n7. Student life is what you make of it. If you make friends, join clubs, have fun, it will be fun. There are a crap ton of clubs because the large student body ranging from low commitment to high commitment.\n\nAsk if you have more questions.",

Unless you\u2019re driving from nearby or coming on a bus from NYC there is no easy, straightforward way to get there. In the rare event my parents visited it was only ever for a couple of days because they had to build in time for travel and inconvenient connecting flights.",

This depends on your field. For CS, it's quite good. \n4. Seems good. \n5. Better than CMU's. I've lived in two different dorm buildings on campus; they each tend to have their own problems. I had a bug problem during August/Sept. last year and it was annoying but it went away with winter.\n6. It's good college cafeteria food.\n7. Student life is good, but my biggest complaint is how exclusive a lot of the clubs can be, even for stuff that otherwise should not be gatekept at all. As a transfer student, this was quite a shock as my old university (a LAC) was not like this. I personally have been depressed for a lot of the time I've been here, but I think that's more a consequence of not having a solid friend base due to the pandemic/transferring than anything else. As a freshman admit, you shouldn't have those problems, especially if you're involved with clubs.",

            "comment": "My strong advice is to physically visit both schools.  The environment of the two is quite different (which you can see by looking at Google Maps), and you'll hopefully find that you feel more comfortable at one or the other.  I easily made my decision once I visited the schools.\n\nMy experience is that you should choose your undergrad just based on your feelings, as you should have a similar undergrad experience at many schools.  Frankly, you'll get out of it what you put into it and you can find the same experience and opportunities at different schools, so don't obsess on that.  Just go where you feel you could be happy.\n\nGrad school is a different matter, and you will be choosing schools based on specific criteria.  But you'll have a lot of experience in the field at that point, so you'll know what to look for and what exactly you want.",

You should be studying and going to class, but if not, try one of the trails. And if not, explore downtown. And if not, explore the campus. Or hang out with friends in collegetown. There is a bowling alley, gyms, rock climbing, tennis center, gaming lounge, and more. Listen, it is what you make it out to be. If you pout about not being able to constantly whiff the nyc pollution, you're never going to feel good here. Yeah it's in the middle of upstate new york. Yeah it's beautiful and perfect for focusing on working on yourself. And yeah, I would challenge any urban guy to come by and take it all in for those 4 years on the hill.",

The main reason was that cornell has better nature, bigger dorm rooms (the double I saw in cmu was the size of my single in cornell), and better food (in my opinion). I don't really care for cities. Also I was interested in the humanities, which were stronger at cornell. I have met a lot of people here who chose cornell over cmu, so you aren't the first to have this dilemma haha.",

Other factors to consider : CMU is next to one of top hospital systems (UPMC) where you can get easier access to research opportunities with highly regarded medical professionals. Cornell of course offers research opportunities but Med school is 200 miles away in NYC. Good news is you can\u2019t go wrong either way. Size of the school is something you should consider as well.",

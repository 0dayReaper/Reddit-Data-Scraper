I got a 4.99 but was expecting a 5.0 based on my weighted average and the mean and standard deviation and skewness and kurtosis and what all my friends say their evaluations were.  Feels bad dudes.  Did any other profs expect higher evaluations?  Do some students just not give 5's?  If I email my students, can they still change their evaluations in Student Center?  I heard that emailing your student can't hurt; worst they can say is no.  What if they don't respond haha.  If I need to escalate who do I go to?  The Ombudsman?  Or Lombardi?  (Is he okay?)\n\n/s",

    "postText": "I just finished my sophomore year and I was planning to declare my major over the summer but I've been indecisive whether to do CS or info sci. I just wondered if anyone knew if it would be okay to declare the CS (or info sci) major over the summer, even though the timeline doesn't guarantee it'll get processed until October 15? The deadline for getting it processed by July is tomorrow (gulp). I tried emailing my CS advisor but I didn't get a response :(.",

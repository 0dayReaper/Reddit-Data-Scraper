    "postText": "My favorite cousin, who is 21 years old and healthy on all scales, has recently passed from complications due to a blood clot formed in her brain from the coronavirus. It was all very quick- her family did not even know she was positive when suddenly she said she couldn't move anything on her left side of her body and was rushed immediately to the ER where she died not long after. I'm still in shock and am afraid for my life everytime I leave my home.\n\nThe most unfair part about this is that she observed all the rules. She wore a mask, she tried her best to keep 6 ft from everyone and only went out to work at her job since she is an essential worker and my cousins family needs her income to live paycheck to paycheck. I just saw a post on this subreddit about someone who doesn't observe these simple rules and it PISSED me off. Idealistically, if most people observed the rules, we might have been able to flatten this curve earlier and maybe one of my favorite people on this planet wouldn't have died. I'm so angry with this world right now because it seems like people like me who are low income who HAVE to work to afford basic necessities are most at risk due to assholes like u/ascape2 who ignore precautions and asymptomatically spread the virus to us.\n\nI also realize most people on reddit do follow the rules and wear masks and such, and so this post probably won't make much of a difference, but I hope it inspires at least one person to start following the rules. We as young healthy college students may not be the highest at-risk demographic, but we aren't immune to the virus and never know what could happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**edit: title should say ANYONE can die from covid-19**",

I think a major chunk of ppl at Cornell are going to ignore rules cause they can't even slightly comprehend the severity of their actions. But at the same time I blame Cornell for reopening in person and I feel bad for the locals in Ithaca who in my opinion are actually doing a great job following the rules.",

Unfortunately, people can\u2019t be brought back to life. There are reports that covid causes irreversible damage to the body even if you recover from covid. If Cornell stays closed, Ithaca can survive. This will protect lives and keep businesses open. We\u2019ve been good about being safe. By Cornell reopening, it puts the community at risk. Ithaca\u2019s population will increase. Buses, stores and the commons will be packed. if community spread increases, then we\u2019ll be shut down again. When the universities shut down, they helped protect our community. If they didn\u2019t, we would have been the next NYC. Ithaca doesn\u2019t have the resources to care for the community and the student population. Cornell should follow ICs reopening plan and only allow students that are not on New York\u2019s travel restriction list. I understand students want to return to normal but we can\u2019t make a cake and eat it too. We all made sacrifices. Students must to do the same.",

No. But when given two extreme options it\u2019s the best option. \n\nI don\u2019t know about IC\u2019s plan in detail but going off of what you stated, that seems to be a very poor approach to reopening the school.

I understand that everyone wants to come back and have the college experience but we need to protect lives 1st. Public safety is the top priority. That was and still is in NY. Cornell is an educational institution, not the CDC. It needs to consider the impact on local lives including its own workforce. By reopening, it\u2019s actions will affect  not just the students lives, It will affect the community. If we shut down again, we will need to close schools, businesses and the colleges.

I highly doubt many students traveling from NY restricted states will quarantine for the 28 total days that Cornell is advising/requiring (14 days at home before travel and 14 days upon arrival). This would require going into quarantine on August 5. Some students who need to help out their family when it comes to paying bills and/or caretaking cannot afford to do this. This is not even to mention the temptation to hang out, go out, etc. that the irresponsible among us will likely give into.

It sickens me when I see people who delude themselves and say, \"Yeah, but I'll wear a mask, yeah but it's not that deadly, yeah but I'm only 21, yeah but I'm willing to take that risk,\" it's sickens me to the core whenever I see someone do mental gymnastics to convince themselves that this risk is somehow worth being able to attend classes in person, or for some shred of FOMO-esque stab at social interaction. They'll do/think anything to label anything that disagrees with their view as \"fear-mongering,\"  as if they were some Fox-News segment comparing Covid-19 deaths to \"[swimming pool deaths.](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/on-fox-news-dr-phil-said-360000-americans-die-in-swimming-pools-every-year-hes-wrong-by-magnitudes/)\" It's as if they don't care; they say they care but their actions disprove themselves entirely. Like, JUST SAY YOU DON\"T CARE, I'd rather hear that from you than some stupid platitude about being informed and staying at home. It's always a myth until you or a family members suffers from it. It's as if I walked onto campus and screamed help me, my family is dying, and they just look blankly back at me and go about their day worrying about being able to meet their friend groups. I hate it, I despise it, I've started seeing people differently ever since this pandemic. I used to care so much about friends and my social life, but now that I realize what's left of my family is really I have by my side, I see how naive and downright stupid some of my classmates are. Let's not even mention those who aren't even bothered to follow social distancing for their dumb pubescent parties, the ones who want to go back and actively lie (to themselves) about the impact of the virus to get more facetime in Ithaca as if getting that \"camaraderie\" and \"college experience\" is more important than everyone's safety are bad enough. I don't check reddit much, but lmk if you want to talk, hopefully some of what I said resonates slightly.",

I hate the GOP to make a concern like this a political issue while it clearly is a health issue.  WEAR A MASK AND STAY HOME as much as you can ffs.\n\nThis has already been a stressful time for so many of us and to deal with a loved ones death, along with all the stupidity going around must be tough. \n\nThanks for sharing, more strength to you and your family.",

As someone who\u2019s seen friends and family struggle through COVID (who were all following CDC guidelines, but essential workers), it absolutely boils my blood that people aren\u2019t taking this seriously. My heart hurts for you and your loved ones. I hope that your cousin can rest in peace, wherever they may be.\n\nIf you\u2019re another Cornellian reading this, please take this seriously. While you may not know anybody who has COVID, it has absolutely ravaged other areas of the country. I\u2019ve seen people be sick for several weeks to the point where they were hospitalized/almost went to the hospital. I\u2019m very lucky that nobody I know has passed. Please stop partying in collegetown.",

Honestly, the fact that shit like this happens randomly even when you try your hardest to protect yourself scares me... life just ain\u2019t fair sometimes. I am not gonna say too much stuff that is sympathetic because I\u2019m more of a realist so i\u2019ll just say this: As long as the sun sets and rises, everyday is a new opportunity to do some good. Times will get rough but we can prevent the worst by helping others make sure they don\u2019t need to experience the loss we did. In relation to this post, I think that making the community aware is a form of good, and thus, I applaud you and everyone else who brings this issue to light.",

While not in Ithica, I live within a few blocks of a major university in my own country, which has a *much* better record of containment than yours.  And yet, we are slowly re-opening, despite the fact that, with every new stage, the number of cases ticks up again!\n\nStill, *daily* I see the university kids walking in groups, maskless, going into the local stores, which are supposed to be requiring masks, throwing parties that overflow the houses and crowd the sidewalks, and I want to *scream* -- It's not a cold, kids!  It's a total system fsck up that *will fill your bloodstream with clots that can take out your lungs, your kidneys, your brains*!  Even if you only think about yourselves, YOU NEED TO WORRY!\n\nWe are all mad if we think that the economy has to be served blood sacrifices.  It's not some kind of transcendental god-like entity that exists for us to worship!  It's there for us, not the other way around.  If you are really worried about the poor and the working poor, then sit down, stay inside for a month, put up with the inconvenience, give what you have to help others, and kill this mf thing in its tracks.\n\nBecause there is no economy without living beings to participate.\n\n&lt;/rant&gt;",

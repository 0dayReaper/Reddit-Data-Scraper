    "postText": "(Note: I am asking this out of boredom not necessity, I am not applying anytime soon)\n\nI haven't seen any personal discussions or descriptions on what the Cornell AnSci program is like? From what I've seen on the campus (through google maps) there are a lot of buildings in the area that involve animals (like animal hospitals and such), so I wanted to ask if anyone can describe what the program is like? Any info is appreciated.\n\n Some other things i would want to know about is how you get to class, what classes do you take, and how easy is it to intern after undergrad?",

            "comment": "Hi there! I'm an animal science major, I'm a rising senior. The animal science building is Frank T Morrison Hall (not to be confused with Toni Morrison Hall). The hospitals are vet school territory, and not frequented by animal science students. One of the barns is a teaching barn and another building nearby Morrison has is for sheep studies (nutrition/metabolism) and I've been in there for my nutrition class and I've heard the meats class does stuff in there too. There are also chickens we raise in there too. If you do research through the vet school you may end up in the vet research tower or at Baker Institute. If you are pre-vet you'll also have classes with pre-meds on central campus and sometimes the agricultural quad. Otherwise we get a lot of cardio frequently walking to Morrison Hall. I'm happy to speak more about the program, so feel free to reach out.",

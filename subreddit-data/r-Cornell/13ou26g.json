    "postText": "I was recently accpeted into MEng in ChemE and looking at the course requirements and timeline, it is 5 courses per semester for 2 semesters. For anyone who has done MEng, especially ChemE, how heavy do you think the course load is, and how much work is the MEng project if it counts the same as a single course?\n\nAlso, I am an international student from Canada looking to work in the US, would going to a US school like Cornell expose me to more opportunities to work in the US or connections with big US companies? Or is it not worth it and I might as well stay in Canada?",

    "postText": "So I fucked up today. At a graduation ceremony I managed to lose my dorm room key somewhere on campus (I think Barton or Bartels). It happens to also be by itself because it fell off of my key ring. I know I am absolutely fucked and will most likely have to pay the key replacement fee. So it\u2019s a long shot but if anyone has found a lost key please let me know. :)",

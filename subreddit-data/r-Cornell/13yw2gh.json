    "postText": "I really messed up somehow and managed to get a D in 2080. I've also been struggling in my intro biology classes this entire year, and even though I've been working on improving my study habits, barely any improvement has been seen in my bio and chem courses. I wanted to be pre-med when I first came in as a freshmen but this year has crushed any sort of hope I had. Should I change majors to something that is les rigorous?",

Go to office hours, have a plan, and work on finding a strategy that works. And listen- we all have bumps in the road on this path but if this is what you love and what you wanna do, I promise that with the advice above, you\u2019ll find your way! Best of luck OP!",

Some people just have shitty beginnings and it clicks later on. The professors get better as you go on and you find your groove. Chem 2080 is kinda a nightmare (I retook it this past semester for medschool) so don\u2019t feel bad if you did poorly. The question you should be asking yourself is NOT if you are qualified to be a bio major, you are at cornell, you are qualified. It should be do you enjoy the material! If the answer is yes, then follow your dreams! You will be fine. Pm me if you have any questions (i was a bio student advisor too so im pretty knowledgeable)",

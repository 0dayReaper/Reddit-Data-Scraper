    "postText": "Anybody study abroad the last semester before graduation? Can you do that? I can graduate a semester early with a degree in CS but I can also graduate on time in 2024 spring with cs and econ by taking some econ courses in my last semester. I'd be interested in taking econ classes abroad my last semester. Does anybody have experience on this know if it's possible?",

I think that Cornell\u2019s policy also specifies that you will not be granted an extra semester after your semester abroad to complete any necessary requirements, if applicable.",

You can basically only study abroad senior year if you're ready to graduate. If you need even a couple of credits after coming back and need to take another semester to do them, they won't let you go in the first place.\n\nIt kinda means that studying abroad is tough unless you're (1) in a non-rigorous major or (2) plan your schedule smoothly from the beginning of your school career in a way that carves out time to go abroad.",

    "postText": "I am a current ORIE major interested in Machine learning. To current alums who have gotten a relatively high starting salary job, how did you land the job? Could you talk about what specific skills you worked on, how you networked, what classes you took, how much did your GPA matter, etc? And would I be able to PM you asking for more info? and how did you know your major was for you?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqdmiu01dg5b1.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5615f98551bf0af7a371f3e7f50f9627d0ccab4c",

            "comment": "Not in ORIE, but in my experience the best thing was having multiple offers to compare.\n\nDuring my senior year before I did the MEng, I had an offer that I thought was alright but the cost of living was low so it was pretty good. It was still almost a year until I'd graduate so I hadn't had any opportunity to explore my other options, so I turned it down. 6 months later, I kicked my job search into crazy mode and ended up getting another offer from the first company, this time 10% higher, and 4 other offers. Every single one of the other offers I received was significantly higher than the first and made me realize I had more potential.\n\nI ultimately ended up accepting an offer almost 60% higher than my original offer the previous year. Higher cost of living but the salary more than makes up for it. I'm sure there's an element of luck and privilege, since not everyone has the resume to get multiple offers, much less offers that overlap to give the opportunity to compare (I've heard CS/tech is notorious for exploding offers). Having a best alternative option also gives you more ability to negotiate.\n\nBut to do that, I spent 1-3 hours every day for several months searching for and applying to jobs, sending emails, networking, talking to former colleagues etc. Really treating it like 8 credits of courses. My offers came from 1) career fair 2/3) online application 4) referral after a cold LinkedIn DM to an alumnus 5) referral from my research lab. Do not discount the value of networking and putting your name out there, and don't just waste 100% of your time shouting into the void of online applications.",

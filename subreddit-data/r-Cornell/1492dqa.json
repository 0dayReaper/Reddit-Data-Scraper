Internships, jobs, vacations, passion projects, etc.). \n\nAt the same time, a lot of folks use the time for rest and respite. The schoolyear takes a lot out of us and there's nothing wrong with choosing to use your break as a recovery period (which is to say, yes, it's \"normal\"). \n\nI would focus your time on doing things you enjoy, rather than worrying about whether they're \"normal\" things to do, or comparing yourself to other folks with different circumstances and opportunities. If you want to get busier, then get busier, but how you spend your break is only relevant to what you want in the now and future, not to anybody else.",

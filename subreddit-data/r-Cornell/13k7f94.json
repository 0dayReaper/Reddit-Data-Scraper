    "postText": "Does anyone know which department at cornell has the smoothest petitionining process for requesting external credit validation for introductory stats? I am a transfer student and need stats for major affiliation, the class I took at my old school seems similar in content to most intro stats classes here but I am still slightly worried and would like to go through the easiest channels, so not sure which department to do that through.\nThanks!",

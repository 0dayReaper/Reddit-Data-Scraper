    "postText": "I started going to like only half the OS lectures after the first couple weeks and then I did really well on the first prelim so I decided it was probably fine to just not go at all. So I stopped going to lectures entirely. Then, I was super busy the week of prelim 2 and forgot it was happening so I straight up just missed it (it was okay though, best 2/3 with 2 prelims + final) And then, obviously I put off studying for the final for a while. \n\nI had work today from 12-2, and for whatever reason, I thought the OS final was at 8PM. So I planned to study during my shift (my job is compatible with that), and then after work cram til before the exam, which works fine for me because I am good at memorizing things. When I got off work, for some reason I had the instinct to check the exam location again, and then I saw the final was actually at 2PM, and had therefore started like 10 minutes ago. On my way, I bought a pen at the Cornell store and then went and took the exam.\n\nIdk how I'm ever going to stop doing shit like this because I keep getting away with it. Based on how the exam went, I'm confident I will still pass the class, and so there will be no penalty for my stupid decisions and it's just gonna keep happening",

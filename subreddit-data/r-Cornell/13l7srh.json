My last name is very uncommon in the US (and fairly uncommon in [Scandinavian Country of Name Origin]), so I think it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019ll ever change it.",

However, I think I'd use my last name for (hopefully) a future DVM degree (ie Dr. My future maiden name)  if I am not married before Veterinary school, because I spent more time working towards my career with the support of my family than my bf, and little me with the dream of getting to that place did not have my bfs last name.",

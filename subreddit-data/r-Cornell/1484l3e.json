    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm a recent admit to AAP off the waitlist for the Class of 2027, and I'm deciding whether to commit. My major is Urban and Regional Studies, and I plan to minor in Public Policy or Political Science. I'm currently committed to UC Berkeley, and I've grown attached to the community I've found at Cal. However, Cornell offers a more well resourced Urban Studies program and deeper connections along the East Coast. \n\nBerkeley and Cornell both pioneered Urban Studies programs at the undergraduate level and continue to be two of the best in the world, so either way I can't go wrong but am still very conflicted. I've grown up in large cities, mainly NYC, and find the thought of isolation and brutal winters in Ithaca to be daunting, unlike in the Bay Area where I'd have a temperate climate and a mirage of activities at my disposal. I'd be in Ithaca for only 6 semesters though because AAP has a semester in NYC and another in Rome, but three years in Ithaca is still a long time. \n\nI guess my main dilemma is: do I prioritize my immediate career after finishing my undergraduate studies by choosing Cornell or being in an environment where I'm more comfortable at Berkeley? That's not to say Berkeley doesn't have amazing resources as well; it's one of the best for Urban Studies and one of the best schools in the world regardless. I'm just concerned about how its more West Coast-oriented alumni network and weaker advising will affect me in the future, not to mention its student body size.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. As you can probably tell, I'm indecisive and an overthinker.",

It prevents it from being the cesspool that is California. \n\nIn reality, you\u2019ll likely never be in a place with that much clean air, nature, and educated people in your life again if you spent time in Ithaca. Waterfalls integrated into the campus, colorful forestry, altitude views. Boohoo you \u201ccan\u2019t do anything\u201d but enjoy nature, explore the local town, or immerse yourself in the campus community. You\u2019re only at undergrad for a few years too, how about also studying? Lmao. Maybe Ithaca could bore you as a place to live forever, but as a place to do undergrad? City people smh \n\nAlso now that I\u2019ve spent sufficient years in California, fuck that place. Literally an overcrowded, overpriced desert. I\u2019ll never understand.",

There's maybe a few days out of each winter where there's a lot of snow or the temperature is below average, but for the most part winters are not that bad here. We don't get the crazy snow that Buffalo, Rochester, or Syracuse gets because we are mostly sheltered from lake effect snow.",

            "comment": "As someone in the URS major from California, I had trouble with the same decision. I ultimately chose Cornell for a multitude of reasons which I can briefly go over if you want. Regarding you wanting a community feel, the URS major at Cornell is very small (like 30ish?) which is cool because you get to know everyone pretty well, especially since we have similar interests and often find ourselves in the same clubs and activities. AAP itself is also a small community, and with most of our classes is one area, it\u2019s nice to see familiar faces all the time. Also, while the weather in the Bay Area is certainly better, it\u2019s not socal so they still get a lot of gloom and rain which can be pretty depressing too. Personally I think there is no benefit of Cal over Cornell unless you have in-state tuition or plan on living in California in the future. Cornell offers a lot of cool individual opportunities (especially Cornell in Rome!) that are built to allow you to find your individual passions and study pretty much whatever you want. I would check the curriculum of Cal URS vs Cornell URS, but I can almost guarantee that Cornell URS curriculum has wayyyyy more flexibility and fun. If you have any questions you can ask me, but I would 100% say pick Cornell.",

If you want to find a nice/affordable place, you need to start looking 10 months before the lease starts, and sign well before December of the prior year. Past that, it's whatever scraps are left, or the occasional nice place that fell through the cracks or someone abruptly decided to study abroad and sublet their spot on a lease. It really sucks.",

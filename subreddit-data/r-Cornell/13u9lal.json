    "postText": "Hey everyone! Quick question: does anyone know what the minimum grade requirement is to apply and become a TA for BIOMI 2900?  \n\n\nI've been considering applying to be a TA for the next semester, but I'm not sure what the minimum grade requirement is. Can anyone provide some insight? Would it be something like A-/A? I'd love to hear from anyone who has applied or has information about this. Your input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

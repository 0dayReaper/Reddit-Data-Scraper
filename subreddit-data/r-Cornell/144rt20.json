But the choice is entirely up to you, if you'd like to take 2110+2800, or just 2800, or not take a CS course altogether and push your CS curriculum to second semester, you're free to do so. Order doesn't matter, since neither course is a prerequisite for the other",

            "comment": "CS 2110 + CS 2800 is a pretty common spring semester course load for CS majors. CS 2800 has no programming component (i.e. basically a math class), so I think it is a bit weird to just take that without any programming for an entire semester. I would recommend you take CS 2110 or both together; you can always drop CS 2800 if it ends up being too much.",

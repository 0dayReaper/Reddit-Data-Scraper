    "postText": "Hi! I am an admitted and committed Biometry and Statistics transfer student entering Cornell as a sophomore this coming Fall. I'm so excited to enter, but I had a few concerns about the major. I am unsure on whether or not I want to go into finance or CS, or something else, so I wanted to gain experience in both fields so I can make a decision when at Cornell. I wanted to ask whether there were any Biometry and Statistics majors who could share insights on their success with internships and future careers. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I will say the program is neither CS nor finance but you could spin it somewhat in those directions with diff applications of stats. The major does not require \"biometry\" classes so its basically just an ivy stats degree. Granted I swapped to the major after, but I got a business analyst internship from top company. However, I've never personally used the resources within the department. I want to pursue data science and ML, which is supported well by the stats curriculum. One thing to remember is that biometry and stats is in cals do you won't be able to double major with cs, which is a good option for cas students (or orie and cs for engineering) if it suits your interests well. The stats major has some external elective sequences that describe the possible applications of the major well (let me know if you want this doc) but I'd say you could use the major to be well equipped for math/theoretical stats,  economics, actuarial studies, financial engineering and also less so modeling, stat genetics, cs and ml, data science, data engineering, and business/data analysis, and quantitative biology. Many stats majors pursue grad school because the jobs that use heavy stats require more skill and credentials than just a bs provides. The major heavily uses R so you'll get plenty of practice for jobs.",

Do you think that it would be wiser to switch into information science or Applied Economics and Management, if my primary goal is to get a good job, or do you think that Biometry and Stats does a satisfactory job of helping with that?",

                            "comment": "A vast majority of AEM grads go into finance or consulting and if not those two then usually marketing/sales, and fewer (single digit percentage) are doing stuff like accounting or data analytics. To my knowledge it\u2019s not a very technical degree, so you won\u2019t get the applied mathematics and statistics of a Stats degree or the like unless you explicitly pursue that past your major requirements, but it is a rather strong degree for a business/finance career. By comparison, Biometry &amp; Stats is literally just a degree in Statistical Science. Statistics is a very employable skillset to have in many domains, but nothing about a stats degree alone is made to funnel you into business/finance and especially not managerial and strategic roles like AEM feeds into. So it really depends on your goals and the kind of work you want to do.\n\nInfoSci is a weird degree. It encompasses a few areas that would constitute entirely distinct degrees at other universities, and so you get this mix of students in InfoSci who are all pursuing entirely different careers and have very different skillsets. I\u2019d say you can generally narrow down IS to four different types:\n\n\u2022 CS major dropouts, aspiring SWEs who find that the CS major doesn\u2019t fit them, and CALS students who wish they could double in CS, all usually in either the Interactive Technologies or Data Science concentrations\n\n\u2022 UX majors, usually in UX Design, sometimes also pursuing Behavioral Science\n\n\u2022 Pre-Law, usually in Info Law Ethics Policy\n\n\u2022 People doing some funky interdisciplinary stuff, can be in concentrations like Digital Culture &amp; Production or Networks or really whatever\n\nI\u2019ve encountered a fair few of the first bullet type who are AEM majors doubling in InfoSci to have a more technical background, and that may be a solid option for you.",

                            "comment": "Info sci and aem are going to be much less analytical and technical than stats, which is worse if your goal is a job that is either of those. The other reply explains it well too. Biometry and stats major will help you gain a good job for anything data or stats related, even business analytics which sounds like it could be an aem outcome. I'd just highlight again the biggest difference coming out of stats vs info sci or aem is that stats is way more technical and your analytical chops out of it will decimate any aem or info major. If your goal is a highly technical job than it's by far the best choice out of these three. The stats major has 3-4 classes that use R, a statistical programming language that is good with data and visualization. This is not in the other two of those majors curriculums, so it may be a point to think about. I have no clue what jobs you're interested in but the prestigious IB or consulting jobs are mostly fed well out of AEM, while highly technical financial engineering job or quantitative finance is best suited for a stats, orie, or cs major",

            "comment": "hi! congrats on getting in and the major! i graduated last year in b&amp;s and figure i could offer some insight.\n\nthe major is **identical** to the statistical sciences major in a&amp;s. this is great if you\u2019re a NYS resident bc you\u2019re getting the same study at a discount :). however, as someone else already mentioned - by being in CALS you are limited to what you can double major in (cs and orie are not option - but also remember you can minor in anything a/c colleges (i did the cs minor)). \n\nhowever - b&amp;s majors are apart of the recently established bowers college of computing and info sci. so if you\u2019re hoping to explore cs classes you\u2019ll have the same priority as cs majors in terms of registering for those classes (i think). \n\ni also think there is a joint double major option offered with AEM and CALS - so id say if your interests are between finance and cs then you\u2019re in a really solid spot for exploring both. \n\nas for job opportunities - I was able to land a job w/ NASA",

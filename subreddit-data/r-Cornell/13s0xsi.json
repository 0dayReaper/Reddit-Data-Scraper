    "postText": "Recently, my friend has been absolutely grilling me for not getting into \"a better school for history\" than here. We're both history majors/nerds, and he's been acting very very weird since he got into Princeton (to the point where he's completely changed ideologically, like he's a social darwinist/monarchist now ig? It's fucking crazy, he'll suck up to virtually any hierarchy that exists - including college rankings. Oh and he's dabbled into seeing \"social inferiors\" as undeserving of life, more on that later).\n\nAnyways something he keeps bringing up is how Princeton is much better for History than we are, and that we don't even have a history department really (He acts like the dean of A&amp;S himself, pretending to know everything about our own department) and that I would be better off \"jumping off a cliff\". I know he says this jokingly, but he's lately gotten into even more absurd thinking (believing that since I'm not a CS major, which is the highest-ranked program offered here, I am \"wasting space\" by choosing to attend that could be \"filled by someone who deserves to be here\"). \n\nI guess this story leads to my question. Does Cornell actually value non-highly ranked majors? Is there any value to go here for them? I've loved this school since I visited in October and it was absolutely gorgeous. I'd hate to have to transfer not even because I want to but because I'd have to in order to make enough money to survive in the end.",

            "comment": "Agree with most of the posters here:  your \"friend\" is toxic and you are better off cutting him off.\n\nPersonally, I hate ranking. I think it is subjective and meaningless and is just created to make the ranking agencies (be that USNWR or QS or THE) money.  How objectively do you \"rank\" an academic department? Using history as an example, one school may have more distinguished scholars in American history but less in European history and none in Asian history.  How do you objectively compare that to another department who has many excellent scholars in history of science and African American but only average talent in European and American history?  In the end, ranking is just garbage in and garbage out type of bullshit \"analysis\".\n\nYour \"friend\" has fallen victim of equating his self worth to the institution highly valued by popular opinion and ranking agencies. What good does the name Princeton History Department do to him if upon graduation he can't even find a job to teach high school? There people are extremely toxic.  Avoid them at all cost.\n\nOf course, you are not wasting a space here.  In fact you are occupying a very important space.  IMO there are too many CS/InfoSci and premed majors in Cornell.  It is good to have some more humanities major.",

I, personally, don't think they're useless, but they do falter mostly reify the attitudes of the well educated. but, that doesn't mean I don't think HYPSM are a different caliber of institution, or that an MGH or BWH affiliation as a physician would bring in grant dollars much more easily.\n\nThat being said, I do agree that ranking specific majors can be an extremely difficult task, but in the end if the OP appreciates American History and Cornell is excellent in that regard, then he's done really well for himself.\n\nEnjoy the campus and Ithaca, man.

A lot of CS majors end up hating their jobs after, which makes sense since a lot just end up being code monkeys who chose to major in CS while not being passionate about it. At google, Microsoft, startup or otherwise, if you don\u2019t love the field it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you make. Trust me. There are talented friends of mine hating their lives at google rn. \n\n4. Speaking through the lens of academia, every major is valuable because every aspect of knowledge is worth advancing. History is an important field that contributes to our vast and colorful intellectual discourse. Studying something you are passionate about is the peak human experience. There may be less monetary value in history than CS in industry, but did you go to cornell to be just another fucking employee? \n\nMy advice? Take advantage of every aspect of Cornell. Yes, certain departments are ranked higher on reputable metrics: company and grad school placement, faculty research output, etc, but that the end of the day you NEED to study something you are passionate about to be happy. \n\n*Take classes in Cornell\u2019s strongest departments* that have appropriate applicability to industry. So yes take a few math, physics, CS courses in your time here as an Arts and Sciences student. But more importantly *take even more classes in the department you are passionate about* because expert humans are needed in every field.",

There are many other professors like him who are famous and great teachers.\n\nThere are also many younger professors with bright futures at Cornell.  The government program is fantastic too and there are Cornell in Washington and Cornell in Albany programs.\n\nCornell does have stronger preprofessional programs than Princeton including ILR, Dyson and the law school with opportunities for undergraduate students.  Does Princeton have a 3+3 program?\n\nAlso every Princeton undergraduate has to write a junior and senior thesis while at Cornell only honors students gave to do this.\n\nEnjoy the comparative benefits of the Cornell history program and the sunsets on libe slope!\n\nBtw I double majored in math and computer science and took 6-7 government and history classes so CS and history aren\u2019t exclusive choices.

Even if Princeton is better overall, which I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s even the case, there are still subfields within history that can\u2019t really be accounted for fully (e.g. diaspora studies, contemporary American history, classical history) where Cornell excels and is potentially better than Princeton. Finally, most undergrads in A&amp;S have to take classes outside of just their home department so even then you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity to explore your interests or build some professional skills through coursework. I really wouldn\u2019t worry about it!\n\nHowever, setting that aside for a moment, you doing history here is worth your time and effort if it\u2019s what excites you and if you trust yourself to map out a plan for graduation in later years, which could be grad school, law school, curatorial work, or pivoting slightly to a profession where you use all of the skills your major gave you but that maybe isn\u2019t a \u201chistory\u201d job.",

These people exist all over, but it\u2019s up to you to decide who you care about impressing. To me, it seems like a rather large waste of time to try to win the approval of people who expressly looks for reasons to disapprove that have absolutely fuck all to do with your identity and character. \n\nYour friend is likely deeply insecure and he\u2019s been a huge dick. You don\u2019t have to forgive him or speak to him after graduating. If you wanted to show him compassion, you could approach him with that understanding of his insecurity - but don\u2019t ever let it be a justification for asshole behavior. \n\nDon\u2019t get rankings obsessed. Most people never give USNEWS a second thought after setting foot on their campus for the first time. Remember that their primary target audience is high schoolers and - as above - why would it ever be worthwhile to care about a high school student\u2019s perception of you? \n\nFinally, just laughable that your friend thinks he\u2019s worth anything just by waving his acceptance around, let alone an undergraduate degree in History. Do you know what that qualifies you to do? Get a graduate degree in history. Thankfully, your Cornell degree will carry the exact same qualification.\n\nEdit: also reading your post in /r/A2C that guy is gonna get bullied so hard at Princeton. If you want to be really popular at Cornell just do the exact opposite of whatever he\u2019s doing.",

Whatever you want to do with a history degree cornell can get you there. That being said, if your main goal in life is to be rich, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be history major, here or anywhere else. being a humanities major is not for the faint of heart. \n\n Also like others have mentioned different schools specialize in different types of history and programs can vary a lot by college not even on the prestige level. When applying to most colleges I thought I would major in history and I remember how many schools require a concentration in the major and such.  From what i can tell Cornell has a fairly flexible history curriculum. Also Cornell offers some really cool niche history classes I doubt other schools have like history with the manson murders. \n\nOn another note your friends sounds like hes going down a dark path, especially with that eugenics shit. Im sure he has his own issues. He doesnt know what hes talking about I suggest u tune this and most other things he says out.",

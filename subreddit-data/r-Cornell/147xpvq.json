I am not a math major (and so math major can offer better perspective) but to start your Cornell first semester with MATH 2230 is pretty bold unless you have a very strong background in proof based math. \n\nFrom the course description:\n\n\"Designed for students who have been extremely successful in their previous calculus courses and for whom the notion of solving very hard problems and writing careful proofs is highly appealing.\"\n\nYou may be a math prodigy and in that case I stand corrected. But if your background is just AP Calculus, this class may be an unnecessarily rough introduction to college math. \n\nAnd if you are taking MATH 2230, better postpone CS 2110 till spring semester.",

I shall defer to a math major for a more informed perspective.\n\nFWIW, since you do have some experience in proof-based math,  my general advice is to try 2230 out like you said.  But make sure of three things:\n\n1. When is the latest date to drop from 2230 to 2210?\n2. Does 2210 have room to add you?\n3. Does your schedule allow you to do the switch? Last time I checked, 2230 is on TR timeslots whereas 2210 is on MWF time slots.",

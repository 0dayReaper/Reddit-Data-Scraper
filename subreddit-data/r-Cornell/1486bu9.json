It\u2019s because these majors/programs produce graduates who make a lot of money compared to many majors in CALS and A&amp;S. It\u2019s all about money and investing. Those majors are where the money is and that\u2019s why you have more funding and investment. So why not just become an engineer then? Also I have a single in Ganedago and want to swap for a double in West. Are you willing to do that trade?",

If you learn from this, you're better off in the long run.  If you become a victim, you are setting yourself up for needless unhappiness. \n\nAt worst, use the experience in the future to assist those unfairly treated in life.",

            "comment": "Hey my young friend, this is just capitalism. Money goes to where it is in the biggest demand and has the best return. Cornell is lucky that it has a very strong engineering school and CS department. They attract all the fundings which in turn attract all the top students to apply here.\n\nImagine in a world when Martha just picks a couple of random departments and put most of the fundings there.  Well, there are not 1,000 jobs waiting for the 18th Century French poetry majors or Anthropology majors. So do we want a whole bunch of Cornellians graduating with no job offers?\n\nMoney and jobs should not dictate your whole life but it is na\u00efve to think that with an unmarketable major you can somehow get a well paying job. There always has to be some sort of compromise between your own scholarly interest and money.\n\nCornell always leans towards pre-professional. If you are more of an intellectual purist (and you have every right to be one), Cornell may not be your best choice in the first place.",

I\u2019ll have to start thinking about job applications not too far from now, and was wondering if y\u2019all knew if there\u2019s any office or department on campus that can assist me in trying to connect with folks in industries I may be interested in (pharma &amp; biotechnology). Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks y\u2019all",

Look into your college's career services as they'll know how to help you in the job process (e.g. writing a cover letter, behavioural interviews, etc.). I also recommend talking to the engineering career services as well since they would be familiar with the engineering/(bio)technology industries' job cycles (i.e. when apps open). \n\nCareer services people are available during the summer btw and you can schedule in person or remote meetings - I did that a lot last summer and fall. \n\n2. Use linked, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. to look what types of jobs and companies show up for the job title you are interested in. You'll get different results if you type \"lab technician\" than \"bio data scientist\". \n\n3. Find out the career progression of the job role you looked at, I often type \"(role i want) career ladder\" to find that out. \n\n4. TALK TO PROFESSORS WITH INDUSTRY EXP - they will likely know companies and job roles that you haven't heard of and can point you to certain people in biotech companies who you can get in touch with.",

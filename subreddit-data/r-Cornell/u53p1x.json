    "postText": "The Starbucks on college Avenue has gone on strike due to a health hazard in the store being ignored and dismissed by management.\n\nA grease trap left by the restaurant previously at that location has spilled fermented burned grease all over the back of the store, creating a significant slipping hazard and releasing ammonia fumes. The people working attempted to contact management to have the store closed and the problem fixed, but management ghosted them, forcing the in store supervisor to make the decision to protect the employees and customers by closing the store.\n\nAfter this decision, a member of corporate came to the location and insisted we reopen, ignoring the health hazard and the concerns. In response, the workers walked out and began a strike. This is only possible due to the recent unionization of this location, along with the other two Starbucks in Ithaca. The health hazard caused by the grease trap is the last straw for many of the employees, who have been dealing with an abusive and apathetic manager, and many aggressive union busting attempts from corporate itself.\n\nEmployees and supporters are currently picketing on college Avenue, please show you support to them, they need the encouragement.",

I said I was and asked why he was even calling and his exact phrasing was that there were \"concerns about the store.\" He didn't at all tell me what the problem was and when I asked if there were any safety concerns I needed to know about, he said there weren't any.\n\nNeedless to say, learning about all this later i am beyond upset with management for not remotely informing me about the safety hazard at the store and still requesting I come in without briefing me AT ALL on what was happening.\n\nThank you to everyone supporting us. Even given months of targeted harassment and being forced to work in terrible conditions, this is a new low.",

This warm water melts solid fats and liquid fats\u2014 detergents in dishwashing especially help this process. Since the water is hot, the solid fats stay in liquid form as they drain with the hot waste water. However, in a world without grease traps, these liquified fats would make it into the sewer and then cool as the water does, solidifying into what are known as fatbergs. These fatbergs are also why they really tell you not to allow too much animal fat to go down your sink drain.\n\nGrease traps are built to capture this kitchen wastewater before it drains to sewers. The grease trap prematurely cools the water to precipitate the fats out of wastewater leaving a restaurant\u2019s kitchen. These fats are then stored into a container that needs to be manually cleaned and can overflow. This is a very simplified explanation, but it\u2019s the core idea. Some traps are super complex.\n\nKinda like Felix Argyle iykyk",

I\u2019m assuming the Starbucks union is associated with a larger union like SEIU or AWU or something which each have multimillion dollar strike funds just for this.\n\nEdit: I looked it up. The Starbucks union is part of Workers United (an affiliate of SEIU) and Workers United has over $140,000,000 in assets. SEIU itself has spent over $200,000,000 in the last decades on lobbying alone. They can afford a strike fund lol",

I appreciate wanting to know where your money is going, and to be transparent, any donations to help support the strikers are meant to offset the cost of a strike fund. There's a good chance a larger strike will come in the near future, though we need to do more to organize it and see how much support we could realistically get from SBWU to fund it.\n\nIf someone wants to donate to help offset the financial strain on SBWU, that's their decision and I appreciate their support greatly. If not, we plan to pull whatever we can't get from donations from SBWU. \n\nI'd also like to note that nearly every barista at this location has suffered from having their hours severely cut (full time workers being given only 20 hours a week or less to live off of, etc.), so frankly any help from people who can afford it is going to a good place.",

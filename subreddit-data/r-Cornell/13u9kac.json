We were long distance for a year after graduation, working in different cities, but then I quit my job and moved. We're on the west coast now, but we came back and had our wedding in Sage Chapel.\n\nIf you are wondering what happens to most graduating couples, you'll probably not find out by asking just those of us who remain happily together.",

(I met my now-husband when I was a freshman at IC and he was a senior in high school, he had a TO and came to Cornell when he was a sophomore and I was a junior. We got married the week after he graduated, in \u201802, so our marriage will be able drink in about a week. \ud83d\ude05) We have several other Cornell friends who stuck together after graduation too.\n\nI think the important thing in our case was that we were both pretty independent when we were dating, and were long distance for 2.5 years and across town for 1.5 years of our dating life, so that being together never felt like the easy default but a conscious choice. That is more difficult when you\u2019ve been breathing the same air for a few years and don\u2019t know anything else. We managed to stay together by choosing to be together, following each other (we\u2019ve moved around a bit) and by not calling a relationship \u201cwork\u201d because once it\u2019s a job it\u2019s all over. (Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always easy, but I haaaate the \u201crelationships are work\u201d framing.) The friends I have who stuck together in a college relationship seemed to be the same way. I also think that splitting up isn\u2019t a failure if you learn you want different things. A lot of them probably will split up and will hopefully learn something in the process\u2014that\u2019s fine.",

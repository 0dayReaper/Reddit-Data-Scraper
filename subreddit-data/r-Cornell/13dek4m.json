            "comment": "at last. my time has come\n\n2450 teaches you the theory and has you analyze some apps, like learning about affordances and signifiers and stuff and then you go apply that theory to instagram\n\n3450 has you working in groups to come up with an idea for an app that you think might be useful, and then you make a mockup of it in figma\n\n1300 and 2300 have you making websites; you learn about good web design and have to justify the designs of your websites in long and exhaustive writeups\n\n4340 has you making a web application and ofc has design segments but it felt much less exhausting compared to 1300 and 2300\n\n4450 has you analyzing how people communicate via computers and has you run a little study around it. i took it and forgot the curriculum immediately and had to look up my old assignments to remember",

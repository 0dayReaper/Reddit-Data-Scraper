Does anyone know a website or phone number for on campus legal services? I\u2019ve been searching and all I\u2019ve found is Justia, a website where I can ask legal questions and get them answered, but I feel like I need real legal help and advice. I do not want to be blamed for this arson like they have nothing on me because I didn\u2019t commit this crime. Please help me.",

Find a defense attorney if you really do think you could be found culpable. Here's a [link](https://nysba.org/new-york-state-bar-association-lawyer-referral-service/) to the bar association's website which should hopefully find you a lawyer. \n\nShould the police question you, the only statement you should tell them is: \"I am invoking my 4th and 5th Amendment Rights. I do not answer questions from law enforcement without my attorney present nor do I agree to a search of my person or property. I would like to leave now. Am I free to go?\"\n\nIf you can't find an attorney, you have a right to a public defender. How that'll work is that, should you be detained, you tell the police clearly and confidently that you will not speak without your attorney present and that you will need a public defender. \n\nI can't speak to the office of student conduct procedure but I do know they will provide you with a counselor to help you navigate it if it comes to that.\n\nI'm not a lawyer but every defense attorney will you tell you this advice. If you didn't do it and you [shut up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgWHrkDX35o) from here on out, you'll probably fine. If you did do it, good luck soldier \ud83e\udee1.",

Even though you may be innocent, you can easily walk into a trap by answering questions. Our thoughts are more fallible then we think and all it takes is one mis-speak to land in trouble. \n\nFor example, if a cop asks something seemingly innocuous like, \"Do you know how fast you were going?\"\n\nIf you say, \"I don't know\" then you have no defense if you get a ticket. \n\nIf you say, \"maybe a little over the speed limit.\" then you've admitted guilt. \n\nIf you say, \"under the speed limit.\" then the cop can just accuse you of lying and change strategies.  \n\nInstead, flip the question and ask the officer how fast he clocked you at. Let the other side build the narrative. If you know the truth, you'll be on the offense and will quickly find the holes in their story.",

If you\u2019ve been charged with a Code of Conduct violation, then I would try contacting the Office of the Respondents\u2019 Code Counselor. More info can be found here:\n\nhttps://scl.cornell.edu/studentconduct\n\nDo not provide any more information than necessary. Just say that you\u2019ve been charged with a violation and would like to receive representation from the office of respondents\u2019 code counselor. Only provide details to a respondent representative (usually a law student if I\u2019m not mistaken). Again, this is only for Student Code violations.\n\nRegardless of whether you\u2019ve been formally charged with a crime, I agree with the other comment: DO NOT TALK TO POLICE. If you are questioned by police, you can say that you wish to remain silent, or request a lawyer. You are under no obligation to ever respond to police questioning",

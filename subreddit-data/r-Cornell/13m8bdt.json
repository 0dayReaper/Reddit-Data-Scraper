    "postText": "Cornell's SciFi Lab is currently recruiting participants **this week** for a user study. In this study, you will wear customized eyeglasses equipped with sensors and perform certain activities. The duration of the study will be **50 to 60 minutes**. We will conduct the study at **237** **Gates Hall**. You will receive **$15** for completing the study.\u00a0\n\nTo participate, \n\n1. Please expect audio/video recordings, including recordings of your face. These recordings will not be shared outside the research team of this project.\n2. You must not be severely near-sighted (if you can wear contact lenses during the study it is okay). You must be able to proceed with normal activities such as reading the computer screen, walking and sitting when wearing our eyeglasses.\n\nPlease select a one-hour slot on this spreadsheet (you can just highlight it, if a slot has already been highlighted, it means it's not available). Once you highlight a slot, please email (Shawn Chen - [sc2489@cornell.edu](mailto:sc2489@cornell.edu)) with your name, Cornell NetID and confirmation of your selected time slot.\u00a0\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qlmX3OHBPjV48fTC-9NN0RbQbziP54HoiTiEs-TvDKw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qlmX3OHBPjV48fTC-9NN0RbQbziP54HoiTiEs-TvDKw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIRB protocol: IRB0009898 (2010009898)\n\nIf you have any questions about the project, please contact the undergraduate student leading the project (Shawn Chen - [sc2489@cornell.edu](mailto:sc2489@cornell.edu)) or faculty advisor Prof. Cheng Zhang ([chengzhang@cornell.edu](mailto:chengzhang@cornell.edu)).",

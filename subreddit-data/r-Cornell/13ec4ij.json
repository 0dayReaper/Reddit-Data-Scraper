Some entries may be out of date but it\u2019s not like costs are hundreds of dollars more or less from year to year.\n\nFor fraternities, the costs for a live-in are generally cheaper than living in a dorm and being on a Cornell meal plan, but the difference is not so stark for sororities, especially because it\u2019s rare to live in a sorority house for more than a year.",

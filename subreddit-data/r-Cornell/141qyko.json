If you did the C next to \u201cCornell University \u201c then you may run into issues. \n\nThough that would all depend on how small your personal project is, and if you were trying to sell something/giving impression it\u2019s official Cornell.",

Think about, for example, how many teams use a cardinal as their logo and how similar they all look; still, most of those teams own their iteration.\n\nWhat others have said is true: you can absolutely use this for a personal project without issue under fair use guidelines. But if you start trying to make money from it or you\u2019re intending to distribute widely and in a way that people might misinterpret what you\u2019re distributing as being endorsed by the university, you could run into some trouble (likely just in the form of a scolding).\n\nSounds like you should be fine. But be careful about the distribution. If you\u2019re handing out flyers, probably no biggie. If you\u2019re making sweatshirts or decals or something, more caution required.",

    "postText": "I have been trying to sublet my room for a while now and recently was almost scammed. Just an FYI for others trying to rent your rooms, be careful!\n\nThis person used a combo of tactics including sending me a check (from an auto sales company) for way too much money by \"accident\" which a few days after depositing the check my bank found that it was fake. Before my bank knew it was fake they asked me to Zelle or money order the extra money they had sent me to some Yahoo email because they needed to sign up for some seminar by a certain date. This person also used a sob story as an excuse for why they couldn't talk to me on the phone. They even sent me a photo of \"their Visa\", so just because some parts of the story seem legit or you feel bad for them/their circumstances, they might be scamming you! Be careful out there!\n\nTL;DR watch out for scammers if you're trying to sublet your place",

Dealing with someone you can't see face-to-face is significantly more risky and significantly more likely to be a scam.",

            "comment": "IMPORTANT REMINDER: Though we're used to things being instant, like a check deposit showing up immediately on your balance, **check deposits are not instantaneous**. To make it seem like it is, banks add the balance to your account while the check begins its clearing process. This involves basically contacting the other bank and transferring the funds. If the other bank turns around and says \"what the hell is this, we didn't issue this check\", then your bank will take back the temporary funds they added to your account. \n\nScammers prey on people being unaware of this process. Do not assume that you have the money from a check until it is listed as cleared in the bank's system. If in doubt, call them.\n\nIf you need a check that will be guaranteed to clear, banks issue what is called a *cashier's check* which involves looking at the person's account and guaranteeing that funds are reserved for a special kind of check they print. Should you be selling something like a car, insist on a cashier's check or cash to avoid this problem, and call the bank to verify they did in fact issue the cashier's check.",

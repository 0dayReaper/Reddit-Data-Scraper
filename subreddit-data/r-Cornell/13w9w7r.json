Can anyone tell me if it's ok to just go on campus and walk around? And if so, do you recommend any particular buildings / campus highlights that we could tour on our own?",

They are not going to single you out and forbid you to join the tour.\n\nOf course you can just walk around the main campus on your own. A standard tour would likely go through Ag Quad, Engineering Quad and end up in Arts Quad (that was the itinerary of my tour a few years back). If you tell me what is the likely major of your granddaughter, I can elaborate more about which buildings you guys should go into.",

Stroll over to bell tower and get a view of the slope, west campus, and Lake Cayuga in the distance.  Finish up w an ice cream at the dairy bar.",

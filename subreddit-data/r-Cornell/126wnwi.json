You can do 15 every semester, or do fewer in some and more in others depending on your priorities \n\nI prefer getting required classes out of the way first to keep my options open down the line. I took electives I regretted taking because they weren\u2019t as interesting as I\u2019d hoped and I had no more room in my future semesters to take other electives. \n\nFor your first semester, get a good mix of easier classes just to get used to what your abilities are. Take the classes that you took the ap versions of and found easier but didn\u2019t ultimately get credit for. Find an FWS that seems interesting. Get a nice balance of content going to you don\u2019t have to get locked in on one subject and get burnt out. College is harder than high school. Respect that sentiment when choosing your course load. I overcompensated and took too few classes my first semester and had to work hard to make up later on, so I\u2019d recommend just taking 15 credits and going from there",

Depending on college and major, it\u2019s typical of students to take a Freshman Writing Seminar, a Foreign Language, a PE class (often intro swimming to get rid of the swim test req asap but can be anything), a Math class if in a STEM major (either 1110 or 1910), and then core major or distribution courses in the space that remains. Obviously non-A&amp;S students don\u2019t take a foreign language class and non-STEM majors don\u2019t take a Math class, so they may take other distribution requirements or core courses. So like, here\u2019s a plausible first semester CS schedule: MATH 1110, CS 1110, an FWS, ITAL 1201, PE 1100. That\u2019s 16 credits altogether, 15 credits not counting PE since PE credits are handled differently.",

Both these classes are hard-set requirements for every engineer (you could also take CS 1112 instead but python &gt;&gt;&gt; matlab imo). Then maybe take the intro to mechE ENGRI. ENGRI courses are meant to give you a broad overview of the major, and you can take any of them to meet that requirement for any major. With that you should get an idea of each while only completing requirements you need for any major anyway.\n\nAs for the possibility of getting minors, not sure about the other two, but CS is a pretty flexible major that encourages exploration outside of the major. There are requirements for both technical electives and an external specialization (as well as additional free electives) that you can use to fulfill your minor requirements (you can double count between majors/minors for the most part).",

I\u2019m considering Yale even though it\u2019s better for liberal arts because the cs class size is smaller and current students seem to really like it there. \n\nI think both campuses are charming, but the nature and scenery at Cornell seemed to fit my vibe more. However, I don\u2019t know much else about the school.\n\nIs there any insight that you guys might have? \n- How is cs at cornell?\n- Are academics really that stressful? Do you get time to yourself? \n- How is transportation around campus and to get back home? (I live in PA)\n- How are study abroad options?",

You\u2019ll get a great education, take the same core courses that everyone else does, and graduate with a fancy name on your diploma either way. I suppose a few things to consider are that you would probably have less variety in the electives you could choose to take at Yale, interdisciplinary pursuits in tech/STEM might be better facilitated at Cornell (e.g. ECE, Robotics &amp; MechEng, UX, Data Sci), and there may be some differences in perception and access to cutting edge research if you\u2019re aspiring for grad school. \n\nSide note, I know the large class sizes at Cornell may seem off putting but also consider what this means for collaborative project-based pursuits: there\u2019s always a ton going on here from the most competitive project teams who make the apps that we all use every day, to small informal project groups formed spontaneously in a class\u2019 discussion section or a club. If you hyperfocus on becoming a part of a small graduating CS group, you may miss out on the opportunities that emerge from having more students with the same interests in one place.",

Getting into a Graphics course as a non-major is pretty feasible. However, when pursuing computer graphics as an art student, I\u2019d be much more wary of the mathematics prerequisites than anything else.\n\nAll Computer Graphics &amp; Computer Vision courses offered by the CS dept here follow a x6xx course numbering pattern: 4*6*20, 4*6*70, 5*6*43, 1*6*20, etc. Professor Steve Marschner has taught a majority of the main graphics offerings here and uploads his old lecture slides to his personal website [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/teaching.html). Those old course pages are an invaluable resource to anyone considering the graphics courses here, and I urge that you look through the lecture slides to a few of them to get a sense of what you\u2019re in for. Marschner is pretty lenient when it comes to listing formal prerequisites on the course roster, and only really cares that you have the knowledge needed to succeed regardless of where you acquired it\u2014but this means that the prereqs listed on the roster can be deceptive at a glance, and his intro slides will much better articulate the knowledge he\u2019s looking for. The introductory graphics courses, currently taught by Abe Davis, are CS 4620 and 4621. 4620 lists only CS 2110 as a prerequisite, and 4621 lists 4620 as a pre- or co-requisite. The reality is that both will expect solid linear algebra however, and getting that knowledge through Cornell\u2019s math offerings will mean going through the entire Calculus sequence. You can get away with self-learning linear algebra with far less of a calc background and concurrently with intro graphics, but any further graphics coursework will have you hit a wall of not just advanced calc prereqs but calc-based physics as well.",

I think she could handle it ability-wise, since she does well in science and math, but it'd definitely take time to slog through calc 1-3, etc. (FWIW, I'm a professor in computer science at another university, and actually initially was doing computer graphics for my PhD.) Anyway, it's just exploring options at this point. Her main interest is in 3-D animation. Cornell isn't really strong in it, but has other attractive qualities to her.\n\n(As an aside, I think math education at at least my university, and it seems Cornell as well, is far from ideal. I think many students should be exposed to the most important concepts in calculus, but few need a whole course on integration, for example. I'd take the most fundamental and useful concepts from Calc 1-3, and squeeze it down to 1 to 1.5 semesters.)\n\nAlso, to digress even further, is your interest in computer graphics directly for UX? I could see 4621, especially since it apparently uses WebGL, but the more advanced CG courses may not be super-useful. A 3-D animation course may perhaps be more useful. Cornell Art doesn't have that specifically (unfortunately), not sure if CS has one or not. (BTW, Maya, the industry standard, is free for students.)",

The closest you can get to finding a course that uses blender or maya is the DEA department\u2019s courses, which is the interior design dept. As an aside, also consider CS 3152 and 4152, the two game dev courses. They\u2019re always in need of artists and though they do not have students build 3D games, there\u2019s opportunities in them for one to show off their art and animation skills as well as contribute to game code.",

I don't think it provides you funding for a whole new computer, but I think they give money for computer fixes.\n\nAlternatively, I think there is some option to borrow \"against\" your student contribution. So each year, there is this mysterious \"student contribution\" that gets added onto your financial aid bill. I am still not 100% sure if people who are on 100% fin aid have to pay it (I've never seen it as an itemized bill) but I know that on the application for it specifically cites \"new computers\" as one of the things you can use it for.

Statistics here is notoriously an \u201ceasier\u201d major to fulfill in terms of course and credit counts, and it is common for STSCI/BTRY majors to pursue an early graduation or double major as a result. However, the actual courses themselves are fairly computationally intensive and BTRY 4520 is supposedly seen as one of the hardest offered in the entire major. But also, if you\u2019re doing Statistics anywhere reputable in the world I would be shocked if you didn\u2019t have to get your hands dirty with some actual programming in a language like R or Python. You likely will not be delving into things nearly as far as CS and INFO students would but CS 1110 is virtually a requirement to make it through the major it seems and 2110 seems recommended for anyone wanting to pursue graduate and advanced study in stats.",

The driver was at least 20 mins away even though we had scheduled a time. It was cold and rainy and the flight from JFK had already been delayed over 45 mins. Anyways tried Uber thrice- no driver responded. Same w Lyft. Called Ithaca dispatch - would take 30 mins, they said. So called college town back. They said their driver would be there soon. He finally arrived and said he was the only driver for the company since the past few weeks and was driving everyone around and was just finishing up another ride. We were grateful to be picked up, even though it was close to an hour later. Is this the norm for Ithaca airport (with no taxi stands either)or was this just a bad night and/our bad luck?",

Unless you actually like the suffocating and dangerous atmosphere that is New York City, then you can\u2019t really ask for much else. Also Ithaca is gorgeous, which is only possible thanks to not being in a large city. \nIn terms of mental health stuff, it really just depends, man. I don\u2019t mean to downplay anyone\u2019s mental health, but Cornell is just as stressful as any other prestigious school, and they are actively trying to make it better. I hope you\u2019re not thinking \u201cif I go to Cornell I\u2019ll be depressed\u201d cause that\u2019s just silly; everyone is affected differently by stress.",

I went from seriously suicidal in high school to absolutely thriving at Cornell because I finally found a supportive environment and received professional help. That is not to discount or invalidate the experience of others whose mental health worsened here, but only to show that the idea \"if I go to Cornell I'll definitely be depressed\" isn't necessary true. \n\nI am from NYC and like Ithaca a lot because I didn't get the opportunity to explore nature or cool gorges growing up. I think I will go back to NYC (or move to another large city) after graduation, but I think my time here was a good opportunity to experience an environment I would otherwise not have.\n\nThe cost part is an important consideration. I think CS people generally have good job opportunities after graduation, so it's up to you to decide if the perceived boost of having cornell on your resume is worth an extra 60k/year.",

About two weeks before college decision day, I want to hear from current and former students about their experiences at Cornell. I devised a list of aspects I'd like to see at Cornell:\n\n**Academics**\n\n* Well-developed and known computer science/engineering program\n* Have multiple opportunities to study artificial intelligence\n* Able to conduct research with professors who are top of their field\n* Small classroom sizes and low student-faculty ratio (especially within computer science)\n* High average salary after graduation\n* High student acceptance into top graduate programs\n* Have professors who value their relationship with students\n* Taught by professors and not teaching assistants (TAs)\n* No grade deflation (inflation is preferred, but stable grading is fine)\n\n**Location**\n\n* Comfortable weather and tolerable seasons (coming from the hot south)\n* Low travel costs and duration\n* Within or nearby a city with many shopping and entertainment options\n* Relatively inexpensive place to live or own a vehicle\n* Beautiful campus in the middle of nature (trees and ponds)\n\n**Student Life**\n\n* Excellent dining hall food with various options\n* Interactive dorm life and community\n* Clean and modern dorms with air conditioning\n* Large student involvement within clubs and organizations\n* Lively and social campus with happy students\n* Non-stressful or non-competitive environment (common student collaboration)\n* Massive college spirit and pride to attend their university\n* Welcoming community where the majority supports LGBTQ+ and minority rights\n\nIf anyone is willing to read my list and advise me on whether Cornell is the best or worst school for me to attend, it will help with my college decision. I would love to hear firsthand stories that should entice or repulse me from Cornell. For reference, I am still considering Vanderbilt, Rice, and Harvey Mudd. If someone does not have enough knowledge of Cornell but does of any of the other colleges I'm considering, feel free to list the pros and cons of that university.",

Dorms vary and as a freshman no guarantee u will get into a dorm that has lights let alone air-condition/modern/or clean. It is definitely competitive atmosphere with grade deflation and even when students are happy there is a culture of complaining abt everything. I assume the academics and prospects are great for CS majors here but I am not a CS major so can't rly help you there. There are a lot of student clubs and involvement but they can be competitive especially for ones you probably want to join. Most ppl here are supportive of LGBTQ+ and minority rights and obviously its a beautiful campus in a beautiful location but other than that reading your asks kind of made me laugh knowing what it's like here. But all in all I don't think you would be happy here. The food is rly good tho",

                    "comment": "I can chip in on a few of these\n\nAcademics\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Well-developed and known computer science/engineering program\n\nAbsolutely! Cornell CS and Engineering are among the top programs in the Ivy League and the world, and are all very solid and respected. It\u2019s a great place to go if your interests fall under engineering and tech.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Have multiple opportunities to study artificial intelligence\n\nAlso a definite yes. I don\u2019t have any interest at all in AI myself but I\u2019ve found that there are a lot of course offerings in AI/ML/NLP. Lots of active projects and research being done in the field too.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Able to conduct research with professors who are top of their field\n\nResearch here is very competitive. Top of their field? Yes, you\u2019ll find those kinds of professors everywhere in the CS dept here. But able to conduct research with them? You\u2019ll be vying for the attention of some very busy people and competing against many very bright students. You\u2019re not guaranteed anything. Still, I figure competition is a given for someone specifically looking for top of their field profs to do research with, so the answer here is a yes.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Small classroom sizes and low student-faculty ratio (especially within computer science)\n\nNot really. CS courses are so big here that the dept has to employ undergraduate TAs to support them. It\u2019s a large major at a large school. Upper level theory-focused courses will have smaller classrooms but most of the time you\u2019ll be sitting in large lecture halls and the competition to snag a spot in a course is rough. You can end up in very large course enrollment waitlists if you\u2019re not proactive.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060High average salary after graduation\n\u2022\t\u2060High student acceptance into top graduate programs\n\nYes to both. There\u2019s a page on the net detailing Cornell post-graduation student outcomes that should give you an idea of what industry and graduate program placement looks like. Plenty of FAANG and HYPSM if that\u2019s your fancy.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Have professors who value their relationship with students\n\nI love the professors who I work with a lot. They\u2019re wonderful people and value their students very much. You can definitely foster positive relationships with profs here.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Taught by professors and not teaching assistants (TAs)\n\nLectures are all run by professors, discussion sections are all led by TAs. I don\u2019t think TAs ever lecture unless some emergency happens.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060No grade deflation (inflation is preferred, but stable grading is fine)\n\nVery much a grade deflation school. Several core CS courses have B- or C+ averages iirc (don\u2019t quote me on those specific avgs bc this stat needs to be verified by someone else here, but I\u2019m thinking about CS 3410 and that one really rough Math 1910 semester).\n\nLocation\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Comfortable weather and tolerable seasons (coming from the hot south)\n\nAbsolutely not lol. Weather here is really rough, we get harsh winters and people from the south and warmer climates have to adjust. You\u2019ll need to look into purchasing some solid quality long johns or thermal leggings/underwear and a good jacket.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Low travel costs and duration\n\nUhhh idk how to answer this one, travel to where? We have a pretty solid public transportation system if that\u2019s what you mean, otherwise unsure.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Within or nearby a city with many shopping and entertainment options\n\nIthaca is very isolated. We\u2019re a full hour away from the nearest \u2018significant\u2019 city, and that\u2019s still just small and limited upstate NY cities we\u2019re talking about. Do not come to Ithaca expecting the kind of experience you\u2019d get out of NYC, Boston, or Philadelphia, and don\u2019t expect to be able to drive to such a city in anything less than ~4 hours.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Relatively inexpensive place to live or own a vehicle\n\nVery expensive. It gets better if you\u2019re willing to live away from Collegetown and the campus.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Beautiful campus in the middle of nature (trees and ponds)\n\nAbsolutely. Ithaca is gorgeous and a fantastic place to be for nature lovers. So many gorges, many places to go if you want a good hike and are looking to get a breath of fresh air. Many great clubs and local orgs for this stuff too.\n\nStudent Life\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Excellent dining hall food with various options\n\u2022\t\u2060Interactive dorm life and community\n\u2022\t\u2060Clean and modern dorms with air conditioning\n\u2022\t\u2060Large student involvement within clubs and organizations\n\u2022\t\u2060Lively and social campus with happy students\n\u2022\t\u2060Non-stressful or non-competitive environment (common student collaboration)\n\u2022\t\u2060Massive college spirit and pride to attend their university\n\u2022\t\u2060Welcoming community where the majority supports LGBTQ+ and minority rights\n\nYes to all these, only thing I want to note specifically is that some dorms are very far from \u201cclean modern with AC\u201d while others do fit the bill.",

                            "comment": "I was premed first two years before switching to an entirely different field. Here are my thoughts based off what I know and what med school peers have told me:\n\nFor med school admissions, GPA is a very important factor, there's no sugarcoating it. All things held equal, an adcom is likely going to favor the 3.9 UCLA applicant over a 3.7 Cornell applicant. Having said that, if you are gunning for top schools, I have heard undergrad name does matter after a certain point e.g. the 3.9 Cornell will probably have the edge over the 3.9 UCLA applicant, assuming all else held equal of course. \n\nMy general impression was that being a premed is really tough at Cornell (I'm sure it's tough elsewhere too). There likely is some grade deflation here, compared to UCLA (not saying UCLA is a slouch by any means). The upside is that you will have amazing research opportunities and I really think if you can make it at Cornell, you can make it anywhere, whether it's law school, med school, etc. The *general* consensus (and I emphasize the word general) I've gotten from my peers is that they would not have selected Cornell if med school was purely their end goal. There are people who still achieve 4.0's and make it to top schools, there are just likely extra hurdles. These friends I mentioned weren't gunning for top schools necessarily, just wanted to get med school, have no regrets with their time at Cornell, and had plenty of fall back options if med school didn't work out.\n\nI also generally advise against double majoring (people typically do it for the wrong reasons) but in your case, it sounds like you have a very good reason for it so no issues there imho. If you're truly passionate for it by all means, I encourage it but do remember what I said about GPA being an important factor. The grad requirements should be flexible enough that you can get all your prereqs in and still graduate on time. \n\nHonestly, if your ultimate sure goal is to get into a top med school, you wanna minimize stress and costs, UCLA actually doesn't sound like a bad option. I hope my post didn't come off as \"coming to Cornell is a terrible idea\", I'm just thinking out loud based off what others have expressed to me and also what I've observed. Is it worth the extra 80k? It ultimately depends on what you value, what you're looking for. \n\nMy tldr is that Cornell will likely be the harder route but it's certainly not impossible and if you overcome all the aforementioned hurdles, it'll be a very rewarding experience for you that I'm sure few can say they've achieved.",

You should 100% take music classes especially with that major if you enjoy it but if you are pre-med adding that extra layer of stress by filling all the reqs for the major or minor isn't necessary. If you are considering music as a backup to premed however that is a different story.",

UCLA is an amazing school but (with bias), I am going to generally recommend Cornell. Having said that, everyone has different specific needs, constraints, and objectives, so my hope is that these responses provide an objective best fit rec. I would just take comfort in that you can't really go wrong with either choice and I'm sure you'll pick the best decision for you and adapt accordingly.",

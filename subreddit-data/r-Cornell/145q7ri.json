There are jobs out there that my friends have gotten that give 100k signing bonuses, or 180-200k starting salaries, or that one mfer from grad algo who doing Jane street at iirc 350k. \n\nMaybe they could have gotten these going to a state school, but is it a coincidence that I know 6-8 people at cornell with these kinds of offers? I\u2019d say there is some evidence that Cornell opens some doors for you. Easily paid off there loans of 100k+ in 2-3 years. \n\nOn the other hand, you could drop 100k, get a 3.2 gpa, not grind leet code, and land a mid tier level CS job in SF making 120k TC, paying 3k a month in rent. In which case, I\u2019d say that was a bad investment. You\u2019ll be eating ramen for 5 years. \n\nAnd what\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t leverage your current institution to get these above jobs? It depends on where you\u2019re from. \n\nIf I was in your situation, id be comfortable dropping 90k if I had a solid plan for what resources I want to take advantage of at cornell. I\u2019d be like: yeah let me double major in math and CS, take grad courses, do project teams and/or research, while grinding leet code, and networking and going out, and enjoying  Ithaca sunsets on the slope sipping my mango lassi from Rose after a hard prelim, etc.",

Cornell is not worth $90,000 over UIUC.\n\nBut let's say if your school is an unranked state u that absolutely no one has ever heard of, then my answer is \"Maybe\".\n\nCornell does have the prestige and connection to help you find a far better CS job than that unranked state u.\n\nBut that $90,000 is going to cost you.  Assuming a student loan interest at 6.5%, if you pay back $1,000 per month, it would take you 10 years and you would pay $33,000 in interest.\n\n[https://www.dollartimes.com/credit-card-payoff-time/90000](https://www.dollartimes.com/credit-card-payoff-time/90000)\n\nFinally, and this is VERY important.  You are paying the loan back with your after tax income. Using the example above, that original $90,000 debt is going cost you $171,000 pre-tax income to pay it back. Had you decided not to take on the debt, that $171,000 would have been hell of a sum to invest in your retirement (in IRA or 401k).",

As a slight correction, federal student loans (and many private student loans) charge simple interest, not compound interest, so your credit card interest calculator overestimates the interest amount and repayment timeline. But I agree with your points about the scale of this debt!",

            "comment": "Unpopular opinion, but it's up to you. Just do your due diligence and understand how these loans work BEFORE you take them out. I see way too many people online complaining about how they've been paying loans for X number of years and the balance hasn't gotten smaller, or has even gotten bigger. Well, those were the terms you agreed to, and if you want them to get smaller, pay more than the minimum. \"Can you believe that 90% of the money I pay each year is just interest?\" Wait until you learn how mortgages work....\n\nRealistically, Cornell CS grads should make $95k-145k after graduation according to recent years' grad reports +/- 1-sigma (https://ccs.career.cornell.edu/dash/dashboard_activity), and that should be PLENTY to contribute the minimum employer 401k match and then knock out 20-30k per year in loans. You could be loan-free in 5 years after graduation even if your salary doesn't increase, but in that time you won't have saved much for retirement, and you might have to live pretty frugally. Maybe rent a studio apartment or get a roommate in a 2-bd instead of having your own nice place, and eat out very sparingly.\n\nThere's also the opportunity cost of investing $90k for those 5 years. Investing $90k principal + $1k/month for 5 years at 6% returns is $190k. So without the student loans, you could have close to a quarter million dollars if you invested.\n\nShould you do this? Depends on whether you think a Cornell degree will bring you $200k in value (maybe?) over the first few years after graduation, and compounded over your career. Is it \"manageable\"? Yes, as long as you work hard in college so you land a good job after graduation and aggressively pay down your loans. If you wanted $90k in loans for a different major, or you aren't 90+% sure you want to study CS, then all the math changes.",

If you live very cheaply for a few years after starting work you could definitely pay off your entire debt in that time. You just won't have much in the way of savings and it might not be a super fun time.\n\nFrom a purely financial perspective, if you can attend another school with a competent CS program without taking on a crapton of debt, that's almost certainly a better move. Do not let USNews rankings make your decision for you, they're mostly meaningless.",

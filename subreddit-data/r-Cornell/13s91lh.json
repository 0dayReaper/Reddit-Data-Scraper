Is this link close to what's actually taught in 1920: [https://www.proprep.com/cornell-university/cornell-university/math-1920](https://www.proprep.com/cornell-university/cornell-university/math-1920)? Anything I should not study (to cut down time)? Just want to pass the CASE and receive credit, thanks",

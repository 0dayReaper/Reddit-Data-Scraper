But by the time they did their IPO, I probably would have some money to buy them, especially when Apple was about to go out of business in 1997.\n\nBut people have done research on this subject. The one investment  with the most explosive upside in recent history is buying bitcoin.\n\n\"Bitcoin was originally worth next to nothing. The transaction that first gave Bitcoin monetary value was in October 2009, when Finnish computer science student Martti Malmi, known online as Sirius, sold 5,050 coins for $5.02, giving each Bitcoin a value of **$0.0009 each**.\"\n\nSo if you spent $1,000 in 2009 to buy 1 million Bitcoin, now that investment would have worth $26 billion.  That *is bigger* than the endowment of all but 5 universities in US.",

And reasonable people will disagree about the best moments of your life being when you accomplish something monumental.\n\nMost people never accomplish anything monumental, assuming we share some loose definition of monumental. Most people go unremembered by history, maybe remembered only as a node in a family tree because of a descendant who went on to achieve great things. If the best moments of everyone's lives were moments that don't exist for most people, that would be depressing as hell.",

Even if we were, not being successful in Kindergarten is not going to make or break your life. The ability to go back to age 5, with the life knowledge you have at the time of consumption of the red pill would make it so you could obtain the grades to earn the higher education that would get your dream job, or change life decisions that affected our ability to go where we wanted with our education. We all know if we really gave school \"the old college try\" or not, going back in time would give you the ability to do it again.\n\nAs a side note, that nobody really asked for; but, I'm going to give it anyway. I came from an extremely violent home, and I'd still choose the red. I'd choose it because despite knowing that both my parents were gonna beat me, and knowing that my father was going to be pedophile; but, maybe I could've changed somethings for the better for little brother. I can't change who my parents are. My brother despite all of our crap, has turned out great and amazing. We didn't make it easy for him, myself included. I was so angry as a teenager, and my brother, being 8 years younger, he was often left alone emotionally; while the rest of us were wrapped up in our emotional crap. \n\nGrades and job are a small part of life experience, and what makes up life. It not what you think about most as you age, and go through different phases in life.",

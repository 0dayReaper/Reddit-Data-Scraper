Kevin was an amazing prof, homeworks were pacman themed and interesting, and the midterm and final exam were doable.\n\nI heard this course was \"bad\" in the past but afaik they revamped it (maybe this year?) to what it is now and If you find the course material interesting I can't recommend it enough.\n\nYou can also google cs 188 to get the gist of the course as we pretty much used them as a resource",

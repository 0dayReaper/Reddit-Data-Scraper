    "postText": "I was admitted as a CALS TO and would enter as a sophomore in Fall 2023 likely majoring in Information Science. I recently received my financial aid package and received much less aid than was indicated by the Financial Aid Calculator. Because I'm OOS, the only way I'd be able to afford Cornell is if I take out student loans. If I don't choose to go with Cornell, I would have to stay at my community college for another 2 years before I can transfer to a four-year institution as a junior.\n\nCan any alumni or current students that took out this much in loans share the reality of it? Did you feel your experience at Cornell (academic and social) as well as what Cornell provides (network, prestige, etc.) was worth it, or do you regret it? Has it been a struggle to pay back this amount?\n\nEDIT: I provided an update for my post in r/studentloans, so I figured I would do so here as well. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the discussion so far. This was my first Reddit post, and I am pleasantly surprised by how many people cared enough to reply. Cornell has been my dream school for a while, so I was having a really hard time seeing past my infatuation and was desperately searching for hope that I would still be able to attend. And those feelings do a really great job of making 240K in loans seem like a manageable amount, even after reading hundreds of horror stories regarding student loans a quarter of that amount. I know this was a stupid post, but I guess I just really needed some direct harsh feedback, especially from the Cornell community, to bring me back to reality.\n\nSo to be clear, no, I will not be taking out 240K in student loans for Cornell and will continue with the CC-transfer route unless there are any significant changes made to my financial aid package. I will be contacting the financial aid office, but I doubt any changes will be made and have already accepted that conclusion. I would appreciate any tips for a successful appeal.",

If you can work to support yourself and/or take out much smaller loans for community college I would strongly recommend this path. And hey, at the end you get the same diploma as everyone else. You'll work a little harder to squeeze in the research opportunities and networking that really make Cornell valuable, but you can do it.",

From the financial aid website: Cornell will consider you to be independent if:\n\n* you are a non-traditional student and have been self-supporting for more than five years; or \n* both of your parents are deceased; or\n* you are a ward of the court\n\nTo prove this you have to provide your tax returns, your parents' tax returns (if applicable), proof of income, etc. etc. It's not a quick fix for financial aid issues, by design. But if you can consider a different path to college and a degree, this can help you get there.",

Cornell now has a plan where they do not want students leaving with more than $3000 a year in student loans, which probably means that your FAFSA showed high income and assets, or the value  your parents home is quite high.  \n\nYou should talk to someone in financial aid and ask why the aid package was so low.  There might be some room for adjustment.  Then you can appeal.  You should also evaluate everything in the aid, did they offer work study?  If so, its a good thing, 75% of your wage is paid by the fed, so researchers at Cornell are often more willing to take on undergrads with FWS.  You could get paid to do research and learn in your field. That's a good thing.    \n\nAre your parents not going to help with college?  The reason they would give little aid is they assumed from your parents income they can assist you.  If your parents are not willing to help, then you should consider doing what someone else mentioned, move out and declare your independence, while also taking classes that will transfer to Cornell's IS program (or a state school) and ask Cornell for a deference.  You might be able to transfer in as a junior, with a better FA package junior year and if you've been independent, then close to full aid in your senior year.  You can also live off campus if you enter as a junior and skip the meal plan.  Cooking at home and sharing an apt, rather than living in a dorm, can reduce the cost of attending by at least $10,000 if you are frugal.\n\nYour financial assets must look good on paper, if you are not getting financial aid.",

Many states have a guaranteed transfer to the state school if you get an associates at a county cc, but that doesn't mean you can't apply before.",

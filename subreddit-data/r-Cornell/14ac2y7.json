It\u2019s a two employee airport and interestingly enough works fine. It\u2019s amazing that you don\u2019t have to go hours in advance and they wait until the last passenger. Those guys deserve credit! Plus Ithaca airport is an international airport considering it has flights from Toronto. Any international flight supposedly required 3 hours of airport waiting and they do it in half hour! Lfg Ithaca airport",

It's almost never the case that a student haggling for points on every other question could actually change the course grade that they get.\n\nOn top of that, there is a tight turnaround for the professors to actually submit the grades, and the natural \"regrade period\" would occur after the grades are already submitted (hence the need for the careful grading on the final).",

But if you can find a job to pay for the difference between a single vs a double or even a triple, I can almost guarantee the single room is worth it.\n\nYou have hit a small jackpot in the housing lottery.  Many people wish they could get a single in Hu Shih Hall, a brand new dorm.\n\nIf you have to swap, just wait a little and make people pay you to swap.  And there are rich kids that are assigned a triple in Dolon willing to pay decent money to swap.",

Can\u2019t imagine sharing a room now, but I do think it can actually be nice to have a roommate for a year or two when you first get here. Ofc I was lucky and I got great roommates, but I think ppl are being a bit negative here; if I had to do it again, I think I\u2019d still have roommates freshman year. \n\n(Also, quite a few ppl will probably wanna switch with you, so you can interview their roommates and make sure the ppl you room with are chill). \n\n(Also 2: I don\u2019t think the price difference is that negligible as someone else said, a few thousand dollars isnt nothing. But I do think fin aid should cover the difference if you are forced into a more expensive room? Maybe? )",

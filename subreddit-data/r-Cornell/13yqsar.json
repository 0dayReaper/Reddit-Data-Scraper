The lease ends on august 1st but is available whenever you need it \u2014 you can also drop boxes there before moving in if needed for free. It\u2019s fully furnished and cleaned. It comes with a spacious porch, state of the art gym, and great natural lighting in the bedroom. The unit is within walking distance of the commons and ctown/campus (sub 10 mins) and has shuttle access to campus). Market rate is 1235 but I can offer it for $800 for the month of July. Dm if interested and for a recorded walkthrough, thanks",

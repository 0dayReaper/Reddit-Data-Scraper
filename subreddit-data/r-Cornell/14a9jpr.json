    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising sophomore. I submitted my transfer app for Fall 2023 and I was just notified that I was rejected. I wanted to transfer out of COE into CALS for InfoSci. I talked to the Internal Transfer Advisor and explained my reasons and they said I looked like I\u2019m in good shape to transfer. Unless it was my essay (which I sort of BSed but not really I wrote around a page or two), I\u2019m not sure why I was rejected. I\u2019m really stressed about what I should do now since I\u2019ve been taking courses that fits with the CALS requirement and I\u2019m questioning if I should even try to transfer again or stay in COE but I honestly don\u2019t think I can take up that much rigor/workload, catch up on all my missing COE courses (PHYS 1110/1112, CHEM 2090, MATH 1920) and continue my extracurriculars. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!",

My original major in Engineering was ORIE though not ISST. Also, I\u2019m tackling on a lot of extracurricular and I don\u2019t think I can do that under COE (personally). Overall, considering how many CALS courses I\u2019ve taken and me being behind on the COE reqs, I don\u2019t know if I can handle going back to COE.",

I think you should meet with an advisor again to go over what happened this year and why you might have been rejected (if you can, I don't really know how those meetings go). It sounds like getting into CALS is very critical to you and your goals at Cornell so I would encourage you to see what your options are wrt re-applying in the fall semester. \n\nI just transferred out of CALS and into A&amp;S and I wouldn't mind going over your essay to see what its weak points might have been (but I'm also a random person and not an advisor so I get it if you're not interested lol). But I also think you should seriously consider what you are going to do if you end up staying in COE, because that is a possible end-result and it's better to try and prepare for it than to hope you can avoid it.",

I\u2019m going to be honest I don\u2019t think my essay was the best since I wrote it pretty close to the deadline so I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing. It was around a page though.  I was told that others have gotten in with poorly written essays so I didn\u2019t think much of it. My internal advisor did reassure me telling me my reasons were fair though so I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be difficult to transfer.",

I wanted to transfer into A&amp;S because you can't double major across colleges (and, fortunately, biosci is offered under both CALS and A&amp;S). \n\nAll good if you don't want to share your essay, but the offer still stands if you ever change your mind/want advice on a new essay. I don't know how they determine admissions, but I would also assume that they wouldn't be too stringent. I'm not sure why they would deny you. But there's not much use in me speculating since I didn't see your application. I hope for you that it was a stroke of bad luck and that if you apply next fall, you get accepted. I'll be rooting for you :3",

Given that you were positioning for/applying to transfer, you may be able to petition them to count for CoE requirements. It's a longshot, but worth a try. Onesuch example from my own personal experience is that I took AEM2210 and AEM3230 to count for ORIE3150. Well worth the in-major A+ and GPA boost lol.\n\nI'd also talk to the Internal Transfer Advisor again to see what their thoughts are. They may be able to give you feedback on why you were rejected, and next steps. Given that much of your reason is financial, you might have a case to try again.",

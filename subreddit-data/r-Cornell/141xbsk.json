It\u2019s no great achievement when the elected government extracts more money. \n\nSome money saving ideas- 1) stop paying city council members who don\u2019t even show up to votes. Like the Cornell students who run just to boost their resume but could not care less about the city or its residents. 2) stop requiring police to respond to all ems calls. 3) build affordable housing in the town instead of the city where it\u2019s twice as expensive. 4) make TCAT free for all residents. Charge tourists $5 that they need to pay for in advance. 5) tax vacant commercial space and lots.",

Amazon was just for books and the creator of Lyft was just a student. The Commons was falling apart. Nearly all of Collegetown was old rundown buildings, and housing near the Commons was $300 a room.",

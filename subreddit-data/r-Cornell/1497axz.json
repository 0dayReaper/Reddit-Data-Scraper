    "postText": "What does \"Same Subject Area\" constitute? Is it by the class designation (e.g. only INFO courses)?  \n\n\nI want to take INFO 4270, COMM 4860, and SOC 3580. These are all in a broader \"subject area\" for me since they help satisfy my Data Science minor, but obviously INFO != COMM != SOC. Am I allowed to do this?",

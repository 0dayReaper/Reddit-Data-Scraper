    "postText": "to preface this i know it was a very stupid decision to not fully read over my leasing email / check in with ithaca renting before hand but i was planning on moving in today and i\u2019m already on the way to ithaca and i just realized that their office is closed on the weekends so i can\u2019t get the key to my apartment to move in. i also called their 24/7 maintenance phone number but it kept transferring me to someone who told me she gave my information to maintenance and then hung up the phone after i tried to ask her more questions but no one has reached out to me yet. \n\nhas this happened to anyone before / does anyone have any advice? my internship starts on monday so i can\u2019t really move in on monday. i was hoping that someone could let me into my apartment like a superintendent and give me spare set of keys.",

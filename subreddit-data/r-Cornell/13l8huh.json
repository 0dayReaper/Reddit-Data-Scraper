You can know most of the material in a course and still do shit on the final\u2026 it doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t learn anything it just means you didn\u2019t answer those particular questions correctly. There is no guarantee that the questions are actually gauging comprehension uniformly. So for that reason I think there\u2019s not necessarily a strict link between comprehension and the score. So no reason not to guess if you don\u2019t know something. \n\nAlso\u2026 you\u2019re reducing it to either knowing or not knowing the answer. What if I\u2019m 80% certain? Technically that means I don\u2019t know the answer, and even though I\u2019m reasonably certain it\u2019s still a guess. Should I not answer the question because I\u2019m not 100% certain?\n\nNow what if I\u2019m closer to 50%? Is it the same situation? What about 20%? My point is you have to draw the line *somewhere*\u2026 or you can just accept that guessing is not so bad after all.",

                    "comment": "I was on course staff a few years ago before I graduated, and I actually think that policies like this are kind of reasonable. One of the most important skills you can have when doing proofs is *recognizing when you're saying something wrong*. If I remember correctly, the way we implemented this policy was that if you said only correct things and then marked where you couldn't figure it out/ran out of time, we gave you more points when compared to people who got to the same point, but then just said something completely false and then claimed to have solved the problem using that false statement. The point is twofold: we reward you for recognizing what correct reasoning is and knowing not to write down incorrect reasoning, and we penalize you for either purposefully bullshitting and wasting the graders time or having a less clear understanding that leads to incorrect reasoning. \n\nThe tricky part of this policy is that if *feels* like you're penalizing working harder when students who didn't work as hard got credit for doing nothing and students that tried very hard but don't recognize that they are assuming incorrect, subtle premises and thus get things wrong. \n\nFor example, it is a common mistake to not realize that a number takes log(n) bits to store whereas a graph takes at least n, so reducing an input set of numbers to an input set of disconnected graphs was actually an exponential blowup as opposed to a polynomial one. This is apparently a bug in proofs that shows up all the way to occasionally popping up in active research. If a student doesn't realize that it is a bug and uses it in their otherwise correct \"proof\", and another student goes down the same path but then realizes the bug and thus submits a blank \"I give up\" flavor answer, who should get more points?",

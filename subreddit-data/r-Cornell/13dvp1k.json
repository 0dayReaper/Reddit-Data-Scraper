Keep it charged and turned on, and see if anyone tries calling or texting it from a friend\u2019s phone or something, (which is what people who lose their phones usually do). Maybe see who David Forcinito is /if any other notifications are received who they are/if they can help. I lost my phone once before on the tube and was able to find it thanks to the help of people like you, good luck.",

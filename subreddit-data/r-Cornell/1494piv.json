    "postText": "Due to this Reddit being flooded with recent inquiries about housing from many freshman, questions about mail can\u2019t be too far behind. As a recent alum who worked four years in the mail room, a few things\u2026\n\n1. PLEASE make sure to put the correct address on your mail.\n\nThe correct format is available taped on the Service Center desk, and widely available online. If you don\u2019t adhere to the format, it is NOT our fault if your package is lost/delayed. Without this information, we cannot find you in the system! Save us the trouble, and just use the format.\n\nName, NetIDRoom Number, Building107 Robert PurcellCornell UniversityIthaca, NY 14853 \n\n2. Yes, you will have to wait in a line for the first month or two.\n\nThe NCSC services the entirety of North Campus I.e. students, dining, live-in faculty, and their families. At the same time that EVERYONE is moving in and ordering stuff, mail staff is returning to campus and management is hiring to fill staffing gaps left from last semester. Therefore, it is going to take a LONG time to get your stuff during the first couple of weeks. There may be long lines out the door, slow service at the front, and bumps in the road. It is a part of life, and we hate the chaos just as much as you. If you want to avoid this, try to buy what you can in town or come right when the Service Center opens to avoid lines.\n\n3. Just because Amazon says your package is here does not mean it is ready for pickup.\n\nPackages arrive to NCSC in bulk, and it is our job to sort these giant piles and process them. Therefore, your package status saying \u201cdelivered\u201d means that it is likely in the building, but not ready for you to come and get it. Coming down to the center and asking us to find your mail pre-processing is like asking us to find a needle in a haystack. Processing time is usually between 12-36 hours, so keep that in mind when ordering.  Please just wait for the \u201cyou\u2019ve got mail\u201d email from NCSC (and bring your student ID for verification) before you come as to not waste your time and ours. Also, no. You cannot come in the back and \u201csearch for it yourself.\u201d Please stay out lol.\n\n4. Unless we have approval, ONLY YOU can pick up your mail.\n\nWe don\u2019t care if it\u2019s your best friend, your sibling, your partner, or your parent\u2014for liability and security reasons, ONLY YOU can pick up your mail or even know if you have mail. If you want to approve someone else to get your mail, please go through the steps on the NCSC website to approve another party to get your mail!\n\n5. Keep track of your room keys/student ID!\n\nI\u2019m sure that you don\u2019t want to have to pay money for lost fees, and we don\u2019t want to charge you for said lost fees. If you need a temporary room key or a student ID, we can help you at the NCSC (for a $5 rental fee). If you need a completely new Student ID, go down to Day Hall and they can help you get a new one for $25. However, both temporary IDs and room keys have an expiration period, so you can\u2019t keep them forever. If you permanently lose your room key/go past your rental date, we MUST issue a $104 lock change. If you make key copies, we MUST still issue a $104 lock change. If your roommate loses their key, we have to do the $104 lock change. This is for security/liability reasons as we can\u2019t have keys floating out there. So, for our sanity and yours, keep your keys and ID safe!\n\n6. Pick up your mail in a TIMELY fashion. \n\nKeep in mind, NCSC staff are all student workers after 4:00pm. We want to get home just as much as you do, so please pick up your packages in a timely fashion. If you show up at 10:04 begging to pick up your textbook that you need right now, you\u2019re going to have to wait until the next morning. Additionally, we are NOT a holding facility! We only keep packages for 7 days before returning to sender, so come get your stuff promptly.  \n\n7. DO NOT ORDER YOUR MEDICATION OR OTHER EMERGENCY MEDICAL SUPPLIES THROUGH US!\n\nWe have Cornell Health for a reason. If you have emergency medication that you need ASAP, DO NOT order it through the Service Center. We cannot guarantee that we will have enough staff/time to get it through ASAP. \n\n8. Please be respectful of all workers!\n\nAside from the few members on profesional staff (who are lovely humans), all employees at the NCSC are fellow students. When we\u2019re in the back processing dirty packages or up front helping customers, a smile and a \u201cthank you\u201d really does go a long way. Please be patient with us if we make a mistake, and just treat us with respect! We want to help y\u2019all\u2014it\u2019s our job!\n\nI\u2019m definitely forgetting some stuff, but NCSC staff is there to help you guys when you get there.

Even without mailroom delays, Amazon typically takes a week to delivery to the north campus mail room and did so exclusively via US Postal Service delivery (this was very clear when ordering \u2014- estimated delivery dates for 7-9 days later were usually accurate \u2014- then add 1-2 more days for service center to sort and email student).   Using an Amazon pickup locker location might net you something faster.   \n\nAlso, service center lines for pickups last fall were 2-3 hours on weekends, so plan accordingly.  \n\n*Having a realistic expectation saves a lot of angst.*",

Not having more than one service center on north puts strain on everything, so unfortunately wait times and processing times will be long for a little while.\n\nSeconding OP, seriously try not to get anything emergency for the first few weeks if you can avoid it. We really can't make special exceptions and there's a chance it won't be ready by the time you need it.\n\nAdditionally, just general advice, use the dump and run! At the end of every year, the school puts out bins for people to drop stuff they don't need/ can't take with off. Anything you will need for a dorm will be there at the start of the year for WAY cheaper than you could buy it online. We're talking kitchen stuff, organizers, clothes, bedding, pillows, appliances, etc. It's usually in the Ithaca mall, which you can use your convenient free bus pass and go using the 30 bus just outside of RPCC. They post their hours online closer to the start of the year.",

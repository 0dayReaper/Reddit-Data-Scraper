If you take one or both of the numerical analysis courses it'd be even less because they double count for the analysis requirement.",

I'd even go so far as to say it feels more like being a CS major than a math major because the only CS classes that count have a lot of prereqs.\n\nLike just to be clear, I had a few (2?) more CS classes than I needed for the minor, have a job in tech, and still didn't get enough classes to finish the CS concentration.\n\nTo respond more directly to OPs question, if you are already doing a CS major, then just do 3. I highly doubt any potential employer really cares what your concentration, and doing 3 will give you the most flexibility in choosing which additional math classes you want to take beyond analysis and algebra. If you end up completing the requirements for another concentration and what to go with that for the flex, there's nothing wrong with that but I don't think it's worth prioritizing.",

Math will obviously give you a great background too, but I\u2019m doing a CS/Stats double right now and have honestly had a much more enjoyable time working with the stats department than the math department. Still gives you rigorous technical background, but a little bit more focused towards the data science type stuff which can be nice for jobs. Plus, if the tech industry tanks stats is generally still employable somewhere.",

Doing the CS conc will make fulfilling your Math major easier with the overlap and give you a lot more freedom than forcing a different concentration. With that freedom you could take the stats and math courses that interest you anyways. Tech employers likely will not care what your concentration in Mathematics was: to them you\u2019re CS, or CS + Math, or CS + Stats, but always CS first and not so much those extra two or three words that doing the harder Math concentration earns you on your resume. You might not even keep listing your concentration on your resume anymore after gaining some work experience, or ever need to to begin with.",

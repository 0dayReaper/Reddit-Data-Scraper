It is very new and rapidly expanding, focusing on all things public policy - sociology, demography, environmental/economic/health policy, etc. There are tons of research opportunities and a few new majors that I don't know too much about. Professors are crazy smart and qualified, all doing really interesting research. \n\nI am a current student in the school and highly recommend!",

O\u2019Neill\u2019s very well respected in government. It\u2019s literally #1. Maxwell at Syracuse is also #1, but Maxwell is more ideal for people who want to go into teaching, whereas O\u2019Neill is more ideal for future researchers\u2014though that\u2019s especially at the PhD level.",

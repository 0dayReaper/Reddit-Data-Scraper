    "postText": "After seeing clips of graduations from other schools, I find it increasingly annoying how impersonal Cornell makes its graduation. We\u2019ve worked so hard for four years and they can\u2019t even bother to acknowledge us individually\u2014all we get is a group standing ovation. YES, I know that each college has its own graduation where everyone\u2019s names/accomplishments are read, but that takes place on an entirely different day, sometimes AFTER the general commencement (like mine). It just feels so impersonal compared to other schools and it honestly frustrates me.",

Consider that it\u2019s a tradition dating back to Ezra that the university doesn\u2019t award honorary degrees. In that spirit, I think Cornell has more leeway to search for people  the search committee finds inspiring, rather than just famous or worthy of an honorary degree. As I look at the list you\u2019ve given, I think I\u2019d much rather have Jeong than Musk, even if he\u2019s not as famous (read notorious) and every relative of mine coming to commencement might not know who he is/his work. The point of a commencement speaker isn\u2019t name recognition.",

Maybe I\u2019m living under a rock but if it were any of those people vs Ken Jeong, I would have been snoozing through the whole thing. Ken Jeong, on the other hand, is not only hilarious but has a pretty impressive academic career as well. I can recognize his face and voice in an instant. From the names you have listed, I would still have chosen him. If Cornell were to announce that \u201cCEO\u201d from \u201cfamous company\u201d would be speaking, I guarantee you it would be like \u201coh cool\u2026\u201d and then a very boring speech would occur. This post is implying, to me, that you only care about being able to tell students of other schools \u201chey guess what we got \\[important position\\] of \\[tech company and/or government body\\] to speak at our graduation\u201d and them being like \u201cwoah how prestigious\u201d even though the speech itself was probably mid as hell. This list is stupid and does not mean anything. Put some respect on Ken Jeong\u2019s name.\n\n![gif](giphy|eoN5fHRfV4sSI|downsized)",

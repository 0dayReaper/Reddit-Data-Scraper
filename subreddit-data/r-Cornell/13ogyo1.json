    "postText": "Hi, recently admitted student here. I can't change my email to my undergraduate portal and this is a high school email that's expiring in a month or so. I contacted admission, and they sent me an access link to change it but it still uses the same email for everything. I would contact again but idk if logging in is even gonna be useful because it's just the applicant thing, and also idk if it's going to make signing in to financial aid or Cornell stuff difficult? Anyone have previous experience with this? Should I bother? Is anything even going to be on there or is most the information somewhere else?",

But when students aren't prepared it's hard to get to more advanced material, which is unfair to students who followed the rules. You will take up a lot of TA time, work harder than you need to, and get worse grades. StudentCenter is also going to be upgraded soon to monitor pre-reqs more carefully. Don't plan to be able to avoid requirements.\n\n\\-DM",

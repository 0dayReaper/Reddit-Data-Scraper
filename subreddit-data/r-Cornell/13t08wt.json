    "postText": "Using a throwaway acct because I am pretty ashamed of this lol\n\nTitle says most of it. I'm a junior studying CS, and I do pretty ok in my classes - have a GPA of about 3.5. I had a web dev internship through family freshman year, no internship last year despite trying a little bit, and this year I've applied for about 150 internships (granted many were linkedin or handshake 1-clicks) with pretty much no response, I've gotten 1 interview the whole year. Even looked into research, but I haven't really taken enough advanced classes (I've taken two non-core 4000 levels) to have the skill set for it, and got rejected from this as well. I applied to pretty much every type of SWE from frontend to backend, databases, AI/ML, game dev, you name it. Pretty much willing to try anything or go anywhere. I have decent experience with all sorts of programming languages and tools that these jobs listed as useful. I promise I am at least a decent programmer lol.\n\nI know it's supposed to be kind of a rough year in tech, but all my friends have stuff, and most people I talk to still seem to assume I have a position and get all quiet when I say I'm still trying to find something. Just this week I talked to a home friend who studies physics at a different, less well-known school, and she told me she got an ML internship after about 30 apps (which she said was a lot, so I didn't say anything about my own search) because she felt like getting some experience in CS. Idk, it just doesn't seem like it should be that hard from what I've heard from other people.\n\nReally not feeling siked about my position, as I feel if I'm this bad of an applicant right now, applying to real CS jobs next year with nothing new on my resume aside from some new classes is extremely daunting to me, given that I'll be competing against the entire industry and be expected to have work / internship experience under my belt, both of which are disadvantages I am currently operating without and still utterly failing. Any advice on either routes to take for this summer or other perspectives to help my job search from CS veterans or other CS students would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Fix it! \n- Is there a linux tool or web service that doesn't exist that you have wanted? write it and make it open source!\n- Is there a game you want to build? A tool or technology you want to learn? A Problem you want to solve? Do it!\n- Look into Google Summer of Code if it's still open.\n\nBasically spend the summer writing code, even if you aren't being paid for it. You want to have a portfolio of work (like if you were applying for an MFA) that showcases your skills! It should all be open source on your GitHub so employers can look, but it doesn't have to be someone else's project you've contributed to, it can be your own cool thing!\n\nFrom personal experience, a clean web game or phone app is nice because you can show it off at career fairs. It's a sure way to get an interview!",

I opted to do research every summer in physics (I\u2019m a double major) and had zero internships. When time came to get a job I applied to maybe 50 places and got a full time ML job. During the process it was clear that they were impressed mostly with my CS degree, and it was all just classes. What I\u2019m trying to say is that the Cornell name will get you far.\n\nTips: when listing your resume chose the highest between major GPA and cumulative GPA. I found that most people were atleast willing to give me a phone screen and candid hiring managers mentioned my gpa as something that caught their eye (I have 3.4 cumulative but 3.75 physics gpa so I literally just did not list my CS gpa or cumulative)",

You applied for about 150 internships, but you have never actually met with or connected anyone from those companies before. So, when they review your application, you do not stand out very much because they only see your resume and not who you are as a person. For research, CS can be useful in a variety of labs. I would say reach out to biology, psychology, etc. professors about their research labs. Many labs involve CS at some level. I hope this was helpful!",

I'd say about 1/3 of those who have internships this cycle got them through familial or personal connections. I'd recommend focusing on applying to smaller companies and start-ups, cold emailing some places over this summer to see if you can arrange some work for yourself, and writing cover letters if you haven't. Best of luck with everything, tough times for the industry.",

            "comment": "Hi, I am also a junior in CS. I would say that the biggest tip by far is to apply early - July/August.  Companies give out offers on a rolling basis, so the competition becomes more intense the later you apply. Also you can go on r/csMajors to see what everyone else is up to, what the process is like for each company, etc. There is a list of internships/new grad positions posted by the Pitts CS club which is very useful. This goes without saying but you should always be prepared during the recruiting season. You can't cram leetcode.\n\nLastly, don't be too tough on yourself. Last cycle was just ass because of the economy. A lot of big companies e.g. Google or Meta gave out far fewer interviews and offers than they used to. There's always new grad tho. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t go to Cornell, and my view on internships is definitely very biased from subs like r/csmajors, but 150 unfortunately isn\u2019t a crazy amount. For context, I had 300+ apps and still don\u2019t get any( although freshman + intl combo was a big factor). It\u2019s great that you have one internship on your resume already. Contrary to what people think, having 2-3 internships before you graduate is not the norm. The majority graduate without any. \n\nAs for what you can do now, you could put an anonymized version of your resume on any resume thread to make sure you aren\u2019t loosing on that, I would mind having a look myself, although I\u2019m not qualified. \n\nAs for open source mentioned in one of the other comments, ideally or what is doing right now is targeting open source startups/unicorn who are actively hiring and contributing to them hoping I\u2019ll have some sort of leverage when I apply + plus I\u2019m learning a lot obv.\n\nAnother thing is personal projects. It looks like you\u2019re fairly experienced, so that is something you could focus on. I personally enjoy that aspect of CS a lot. Make something that has a real life use escpeccily if it\u2019s in your life. \n\nComing back to internships, this hiring season was particularly awful. You could look into the pitscc GitHub repo, and honestly just apply as much. Referrals and networking would be really great too \n\nSorry I can\u2019t really help as much as I\u2019m in the same boat as you",

Interviews for contract positions are relatively simple and quick. Many company convert you to a full-time job or once you build some experiences it's much easier to find full time jobs. Learn popular skills through a bootcamp this summer and get some certificates as well. For example AWS certificates. They have different levels. You can learn online. Actively reach out to corporate recruiters as well. Don't be shy. Don't worry too much. You're still a junior.",

Even though they\u2019re a less attractive option for most undergrads, many provide a viable route for getting tech internships/full-time roles. A lot of programs like [NSF REUs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) had deadlines up until early May. At this point, it could be helpful to reach out to research labs/grad students to see if there are paid RA positions or join the entrepreneurship listserv to inquire about potential positions. \n\nFor younger undergrads, I\u2019d also recommend the [Carnegie Mellon REUSE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) program which specifically focuses on software engineering research and the [Microsoft Research Undergraduate Internship Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/undergraduate-research-internship-computing/).

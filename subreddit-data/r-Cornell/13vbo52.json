    "postText": "Hey yall here is the deets, please message me :) its a $950 apartment so i think 760 is fair. \n\nThe apartment is near west campus, and you will have your own room, a dishwasher, and laundry machines. The apartment is furnished. There is payable parking near.\n\nIt has a bedroom available in a 3 bed 1 bath apartment. One of my roommates is already there; he is very clean and keeps to himself. The lease starts on June 5th and would end August 15th, but when you would start and end is negotiable. I will cover utilities.\n\nIf youve read this far but can\u2019t sublet it, let me know of any leads or other places i might post:)",

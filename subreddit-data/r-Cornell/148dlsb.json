I'm not interested in a PhD so I don't know much about the process but I would guess you need to get a masters in applied math/stats before applying to a PhD to have a decent chance.\n\nNot even to mention all of the CS core that you're missing out on, I haven't taken them but I'm sure for a CS PhD they're probably important.\n\nFor the record I think a PhD in statistics these days has a ton of ML/stat learning so maybe that's a better option given your undergrad situation?",

I'm honestly thinking about stats vs cs phd too but from what I can tell, cs holds most of the ML at cornell and has a more applied nature with more coding which I like. I think I'd apply to both and would probably have a better shot at stats given my background but also think CS might suite me better.",

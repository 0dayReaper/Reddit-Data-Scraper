After asking Cornell health recommendations and Reddit, I decided to visit Ithaca Dentistry! They were very fast and kind! They were the most affordable from the options available. Not super affordable, but the student emergency fund was able to cover it for me. So yeah, Ithaca dentistry is the way to go",

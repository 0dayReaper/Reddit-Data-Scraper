But conventional wisdom is unless you flunk every class in your senior year, you should be safe. I think Cornell requires you to graduate from high school.  Whether they need you to have the IB diploma is debatable.\n\nI think it is like AP classes.  You are required to pass your AP classes but whether you get a 2 or 5 on your AP exams is irrelevant to Cornell Admission.",

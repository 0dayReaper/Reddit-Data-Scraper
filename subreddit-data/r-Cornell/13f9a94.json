    "postText": "Hi, was wondering whether CS 3410 had a textbook they used last semester &amp; whether it was a good resource. I'm currently trying to see whether or not I should take that class &amp; what the material entails so I would really enjoy being able to dip my toes into the material this summer",

It\u2019s not really used in the class itself, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s a pretty good reflection of the material learned in the class (which I highly recommend)",

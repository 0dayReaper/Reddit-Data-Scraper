Black students represent a small minority. Native American students even moreso. In all of their classes, and for those of them who are not in program houses, most people they interact with are different from them.\n\nI lived in Keeton and had a Black hallmate who I was friends with. There were maybe 2-3 other Black students in the entire building at the time and they often sat together in tbe dining hall. It was sad when I think of it, but that is how it will be for OP. It is a learning experience.\n\nIf you study abroad, you will experience this as well.\n\nAfter Cornell I spent not one but *two* years (gasp!) living in Southeast Asia where I was the only white guy for many many miles. It was quite the culture shock, but I survived and learned a lot. During Cornell I also studied abroad. And as a straight male I took several FGSS courses in which nearly all of my classmates were women.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t in the dorm OP will at some point have to learn to talk to folks who are different than himself. You will too.\n\nCornell is full of requirements. Even though English students hate Math, they have to take a course in it. Even though Biology students hate History, they have to take a course in it. If you don\u2019t learn to be productive outside your comfort zone I guarantee you you will fail at Cornell and at life the moment your success actually depends on yourself.",

Just because other students have felt out of place or had bad experiences at Cornell, doesn't mean that OP should.\n\nCornell may be full of requirements but living in Ujamma specifically is not one of them. English majors have to take math but they have flexibility in choosing a class that is right for them. If an English major was put in a 4000-level math class by accident and was worried, most people would advise them to contact someone to switch out. You wouldn't tell them \"That's sad, but stay there because think about the math majors. It'll be a growth experience.\"\n\nAlso, what is so sad about black students hanging out in the dining hall? People can spend time with whomever they like.",

But, talking to a few Black students freshman year is not analogous to being placed in a 4000 level math class.\n\nHonestly, OP is likely to be declined because on campus housing is relatively scarce. So there is likely no room available in Low Rise, etc. Perhaps they can arrange a swap but honestly, *there is a reason Cornell builds a diverse student body.* It is intended that you interact with farmers kids, international students, liberals, conservatives, science majors, math majors, english majors, athletes and yeah\u2026Blacks too!",

These legal issues presumably being violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nFinding common ground in culture is of course extremely important, but from the sounds of things it seems students are being designated accommodation based on their race rather than of their own volition. \n\nIdk it just seems rather backwards and like a continued perpetuation of a system of discrimination I was hoping at least more progressive areas in America would have left behind.",

You remind me of myself.\n\nHowever, these houses do serve an important purpose. And regardless of whether it is merely a legal requirement or something more noble, living there is an opportunity for OP to learn to relate to people different from himself, which is one of the purposes of going to college rather than going to Zoom University in your mom\u2019s basement.\n\nI feel you, believe me. But there is another side to this. Altho in an ideal world program houses would not be a thing, they are needed, because unlike mainstream cultures, minority cultures are marginalized. When you create a place where minority culture runs dominant you can observe that many aspects of mainstream university culture are white, christian, straight/cis you name it. Historically many of these groups also were not welcomed at Cornell and they had to make residential colleges of their own, and some of these program houses are historical vestiges of that: they are both a remnant of oppression, yes, but also of the achievements of minority students who made a place for themselves at Cornell. \n\nFinally, and I can\u2019t emphasize it enough, the inversion of the minority experience that OP will experience living in Uj is really important. At some point everyone here is going to be the only person of X kind in the room, and you are going to have to hold your own and relate to people who are fundamentally different than you.\n\nIt is an important leadership skill to develop, and if Cornell is to produce leaders, then this is an important experience to have at Cornell",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m a rising senior (fuck I feel old) and I originally came as a transfer two years ago. I\u2019ve made a solid friend group of five people (all transfers lol) or so but I feel like I want to venture out and make more friends who like going out more (we often go out to eat or play video games together). I haven\u2019t mustered up the courage to go out to bars and clubs out alone though haha (though I plan to force myself to next year). I feel like I don\u2019t go out enough and I want more friends that push me out of my comfort zone so I can be more social at bar and nightclub type scenes, if that makes sense, and I want to make the most out of my last year here.\n\nIs joining clubs and recreational orgs still a good way to meet new people? I feel like everyone would be already in established groups haha and I\u2019d feel a bit weird as a senior breaking in. \n\nThanks in advance, I\u2019m open to any other suggestions too!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m also open to meeting people on here so feel free to reach out!",

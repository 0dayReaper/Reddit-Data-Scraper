    "postText": "I felt pretty sick today, allergy like symptoms and a really bad headache which is irregular for me this time of year. I live in a climate very similar to that of Ithaca so I don't think the relocation back home is the issue.  \n\n\n I realized not long after that I left my student id on my nightstand right by my head. Of course, it follows that my student id card is emitting 5G waves which made me sick.  \n\n\nWas George Soros at the dead &amp; co concert? That would explain why I just now noticed it, he just recently turned the 5G on.  \n\n\nOverall just kind of confused as to why our cards have been engineered with this functionality.",

I am glad the story is starting to pick up, I thought I was crazy. They tried to hospitalize me in a psych ward because I was scratching myself to get the nano chips off of my body. Good thing is that I'm a good actor and I got out of the psych ward (but now I can't stop twitching for some reason). They gave me something called antipsychotic that made the nano chips go away (and the voices too, weird) but I am trying to get them on the down low because I don't trust hospitals. Does anyone know of a natural risperidone dealer in Cornell? Hit me up",

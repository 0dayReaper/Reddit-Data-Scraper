The Sage hall drop box is difficult to access with large FedEx trucks because of limited graduation parking. FedEx does not pickup on the weekend and with memorial day there was yet another day of delay. My guess is it will be picked up today. I wouldn't worry yet. If you want to make sure something is kept track of until FedEx picks it up feel free to come into Uncle Marty's and drop it off here. We have pickups at 2 PM weekdays for FedEx Ground and 4:30 PM for FedEx Express.",

And secondly, what was your thought process behind choosing to do multi before linear? I\u2019m like tied between whether it would be smarter to do linear first or multi first.\n\nAnything helps! if anyone has had this similiar dilemma let me know what you ended up choosing!",

Otherwise 1920 and then 2940? i think. \n\nthanks though i appreciate it! I\u2019m looking at double majoring in math and cs so I think taking linear algebra and then doing multi in the n dimensions would be helpful. thanks again!",

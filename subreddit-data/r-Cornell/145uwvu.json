    "postText": "Hi all, incoming freshman here who's been in the International Baccalaureate system for the past couple of years. Recently been getting lots of emails from Cornell about HS credit, placement exams, etc. and they've raised a question that I think is best addressed to the community here.\n\nSpecifically, I'm wondering whether I should give testing out of Math 1910 with [the August CASE](https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/28702/files/8371950?module_item_id=2053403) (Advanced Standing Exam) a go. I was very surprised to see that no credit was awarded for math for the IB course that I've taken, as it's generally regarded as somewhat more difficult than the AP BC exam (for which credit *is* awarded). Additionally, looking over the course syllabus, there seems to be a lot of overlap between what I've learned and what will be taught, and indeed Taylor series seem to be the only thing I'm missing.\n\nThat said... there are horror stories about this course. By the veritable dozen. [Apparently the mean last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/t81u6c/comment/hzmabnx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) was 28/90?! And I've heard that 1920, especially in the fall, is magnitudes more difficult.\n\nSo, facing a bit of a conundrum.\n\n* On the one hand, I could (should?) just stick with Math 1910.\n   * After all, [at least](https://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?catoid=55&amp;navoid=22440&amp;hl=advanced+placement&amp;returnto=search) I'll be getting IB credit for Calculus I.\n   * And perhaps a gentle \u2014 insofar as 28/90 qualifies as that \u2014 introduction to university will be best. And again, maybe this is indicative of true difficulty?\n   * I would have to study for the standing exam (learn Taylor series, memorize lots of formulae, brush up on ODEs) a fair bit, which is something that Cornell explicitly discourages and provides no material for, perhaps with good reason.\n* But...\n   * four credits represent a tidy sum, and would go some way towards assuaging insane tuition fees.\n   * Also, if I know all the subject content well, I worry that I would be somewhat bored in the class, at least at the beginning.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position or have some advice to share?",

(1910 also has manning this semester who is another classic but challenging, ravi is better) \n\nwhen i took it with delp, everyone coming from 1910 said they felt like they were recovering from a great trauma and 1920 was miles easier, but it's all prof dependent.",

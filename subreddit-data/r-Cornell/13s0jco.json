    "postText": "I am graduating tomorrow, and my parents just arrived here today. What are some spots that you think I should make sure my parents must see before they leave? We have a minivan and are also willing to walk. Currently things on my list are: watching sunset over the slope, short walk in the botanic garden, seeing the uris library, and the dairy bar. Will also be driving them between the different building at Cornell to give them a feel for how the campus is. What others do you guys think are worth going to?",

I think take them anywhere that you yourself enjoyed while you were here, take them to your fav breakfast lunch and dinner place on diff days, hell show them where you took your worst exam. Commons, downtown, plenty of fun activities open up around Ithaca this time of year, go apple picking lol",

You get a basket and a map that shows all the crops and which fruits are grown and you get to go pick them yourself. I went with my gf last summer and it was honestly one of the most enjoyable things I\u2019ve done in Ithaca.",

I think Taughannock fall is very nice, but if you've never been there it wouldn't make that much sense.\n\nYou are allowed to go into the AD White house provided they are not doing an event, they will be holding one tomorrow.\n\nI love Minn's garden in front of the plant sci building on tower rd, on your way to the Dairy Barn.  It's small but nice.  not fully in bloom but there are some lovely iron gates there.\n\nIf you are seeing the slope it is worth going into Willard Straight's great Hall.  That really impressed me when I first came here.\n\nAlso some rooms over by Anabel's Grocery are incredible  (I'm not even sure what that building is called) but there is a room in the front of the building across from the Cornell health building that is beautiful.  Its a massive wood paneled reading room with a fireplace, piano and impressive blue stained glass windows.\n\nAlso, Sage chapel!  It is beautiful inside and near the AD white/Uris library.  There is a window in it devoted to the Freedom riders from the early 60s who were killed registering voters.  One of them was a Cornell student.",

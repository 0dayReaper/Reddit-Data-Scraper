To be successful the last few years, more of them needed to *like* that than in a typical group. So now they\u2019re struggling to have that safe comfy part of their lives totally out of their control. (Wait until we get to the kids who quarantined in middle school that now struggle with crowds. I know a bunch of them, and they are going to have a hell of a time with big lectures.)",

            "comment": "This question has been asked a few times but I'll take a stab at it:\n\n\\-FlixBus to NYC. The FlixBus stop is right across from Penn Station. At Penn Station, follow the signs to the NJ Transit concourse. Buy a ticket to Newark Airport (can also do this in the app beforehand). Pay attention to the departure board to see which platform your train will leave on. The boards will say EWR for trains stopping at Newark.\n\n\\-CoachUSA to Port Authority bus terminal. Once at the bus terminal you can buy another bus ticket to EWR. NJTransit and CoachUSA are options I know.\n\nThe train option is better than the bus imo.\n\nIf you take OurBus to the GW station, you can go downstairs and take the subway to Penn Station or you can hop off at Fort Lee and take an taxi to the airport.",

You should pay for gas, because no one going to Cornell likely lives at the airport, so it will be a little out of their way for a NJ driver, but many might drop you off.",

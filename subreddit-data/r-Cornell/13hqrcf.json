    "postText": "Hi! I recently got accepted for the Learning Studio Build Crew in the MAE department this summer and I was wondering if there was anyone else that got accepted and would like to connect? I\u2019m not sure if I will take it as I might rather go home and I don\u2019t have housing plans as of yet for the summer, but I would definitely like to hear what other people are thinking. Also if there\u2019s anyone who did it in the past and would like to share their experience I would love to talk as well. My dms are open!",

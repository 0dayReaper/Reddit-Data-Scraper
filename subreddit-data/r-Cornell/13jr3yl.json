    "postText": "On a burner. I'm a current freshman and I feel so lost and so tired of everything, and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice as to what to do/how to feel better. If you don't have nice things to say, please keep it to yourself because I don't think I can take any mean words right now :(\n\nTo start, I'm not struggling academically. I've had good grades, but I also didn't kill myself for them either. I know that I'll be able to pass the classes I take this semester due to my performance + preparedness.\n\nBut, I just feel so lost. This first year has been *so freaking rough* in terms of socialization and adjusting. I've tried so many things to make friends. I've tried reaching out to classmates in smaller classes. I joined clubs to socialize. I tried asking people to go to lunch. Trust me, I've tried and tried. But, I don't seem to be connecting with people. I have a few close friends, but I feel like I'm drifting away from them because we're running out of things to talk about. (Also, we're all in different colleges) I had close friends in high school and still keep in contact with them/had no problems socializing previously, but I can't pinpoint what I'm doing wrong to make friends here. Sometimes, I just stay in my dorm for 24 hours without socializing with people (they're either too busy for meals or studying) and the days feel like a week. Today is one of them.\n\nThis past semester, I applied to transfer to 5 top schools. I would've expanded my range, but my parents won't pay for a school they don't consider an \"equal\". I know how obnoxious and entitled that sounds, but I'm a full pay student and cannot afford to pay on my own. You can guess that those 5 schools were ivy+. I *know* how difficult it is to transfer, especially compared to first year admission, but I naively thought I had at least a little chance. I didn't have grades below A-, and I wanted to transfer since Cornell doesn't offer the specific major I wanted to study. Low and behold, I got one waitlist and 4 rejections. Of course, I'm so, so grateful to be here at a school with such a strong STEM program, but I've cried my eyes out countless nights because I don't feel like I belong here, and I feel forced onto a path that I'm not completely passionate about.\n\nI'm tempted to apply again, but I think my grades will drop to around a 3.5 this semester, which probably puts me out of the running for these same kinds of schools, which are the only ones that my parents will pay for. I have 2 finals left but I can't be motivated to study for them, because I feel like I don't have much to study for anymore. I have little to no peer support system here, because I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to.\n\nIf I'm genuinely unhappy here, do I try applying to these selective schools again? I think I have a better reason that ties in with my application more (last sem, I kind of just threw an application together without much planning). Or, do I stick it out for 2 more years and graduate early if possible? Whenever I think of staying here, I end up crying. I don't think Cornell is my place due to location, size, and academic program, but I don't think I have chances applying to other schools. I feel so stuck.",

It's a famously hard school to graduate from, especially engineering. I would keep hanging out and trying to connect with your close friends. I would also recommend going to therapy or something along those lines.",

If you want to transfer for any other reason, by all means, but don\u2019t be under the assumption that all will be fine once you get out of here. Hey, it may very well be the case, i just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great mindset to put yourself in bc it will end up creating a viscous negative cycle that breeds nothing but unhappiness. Take a step back, breathe, realize you\u2019re at a wonderful university with *gulp* wonderful people, give it a chance and grind for yourself and your achievements, not to surpass another barrier of success you believe will make yourself feel sufficient.

Nobody gets into these schools bcs they are great at fostering community or are kind. \n\nOP, have you looked at liberal arts colleges? Many of them are feeder schools for top grad programs, and the atmosphere is usually more supportive (and they are smaller, which helps). Maybe you can convince your parents if they see that the % of ppl going to high caliber grad school is higher than Cornell? You can also be selective about the kind of info you share with them re: your schools of interest.",

            "comment": "I think you already know what you want to do. You're not happy at Cornell, you're not in the academic program you want to be in, and you want to go somewhere else. If you can, try transfer applications again. You could also try being honest with your parents about how awful your experience has been so far and see if they'll come around to less \"prestigious\" options for school. Trying to strong-arm your way through a college experience that you think is going to be miserable sounds like a fast-track to burn out. You might be able to do it, but, to me, that sounds unsustainable given how emotionally taxing this year has proved to be.  \n\nIf, for whatever reason, you're still at Cornell in sophomore year, try to not let whatever happened this year to strongly influence your attitude and mindset. It's only one year. You've got three more to meet people and take classes that interest you (and this is a pretty out-there option but you might be able to go for an independent major that better aligns with your interests). \n\nYou've mentioned that you've got friends, but nothing to talk about with them. To that, I'd say that you don't really have to have anything to talk about to hang out with people you like. My friends and I often just sit and vibe over dinner or while studying. You don't always need to be an entertainer. But also, are your struggles with belonging something you don't feel comfortable sharing with them? Not at all to say that you have to, but being vulnerable with your friends invites them to be vulnerable too. It'll bring you closer together and also maybe help them be more there for you while you're dealing with all of this stress. \n\nYou could also look at doing things more with yourself that get you out more. It's not going to make your problems go away, but taking a walk or enjoying nice food or doing something for yourself that involves getting up and going can help you better manage the things your feeling. The SAD hits really hard at Cornell, but when the weather allows, a nice walk around Beebe lake or through the Cascadilla gorge trail can be really soothing. Hope that advice isn't too generic, but I've also been the person who hasn't left their dorm in a day or two and forcing yourself to go take a walk  can be infuriatingly helpful. \n\nI'm really hoping whatever choice you make and the result you get lands you somewhere that you feel happy with. It's such a shame that your time so far has been so difficult and I'm wishing you the best going forward.",

You can just Google \"SAD lamp\" and find out stuff about 'em. I think it might be a good idea to get one to try and see if that can make the winter period more manageable. \n\nIt sucks to hear your friends were rather dismissive. You could try talking about it with them again, but I'd understand if you didn't want to. I wish I had better advice about meeting people/socializing but I'm also pretty awkward in that regard also (reddit user rizz). This article [here](https://socialself.com/blog/socializing-at-work-or-in-college/) that I just found on Google seems pretty comprehensive about effective socialising skills though; might be a helpful resource if you want a how-to for the beginning of next year. ^^;;\n\nAgain, good luck with next year!! Hoping for you that it's not as much of a strike out.",

            "comment": "A few things. College is not about socializing. I transferred to Cornell, leaving a place where I had an arguably great social life(at least by the end of it) because I thought the opportunity in terms of academics would be better, and it has been. My dad always told me that college is a blip in time, and he's right. Four years is not a long time, so think to yourself, why do you want to optimize your socialization? The social aspect is transient, once you leave the campus it doesn't really matter. But the skills you gain will stay with you throughout your life; will have an impact on your standing and your ability to do something genuinely meaningful. I almost never hear adults reminisce about their college social experience, and when they do, they often sound like complete losers, so keep that in mind.\n\nNext, socializing in the beginning is hard for most people. It is extremely normal to feel uncomfortable and upset in your situation. I've been there. What I'll say is that I can't judge your specific circumstances, but for me, looking back on it, all the alienation that I went through at my first college was by my own hand. I was physically unimpressive and socially needy. I definitely needed the solitude to work on myself, as painful as it was. Started working out which helped my mental and focused hard on my school work, both of which ended up netting me a lot of great friends who I still keep in contact with. You probably need confidence, and confidence is not derived from those around you but the qualities that lie within.\n\nTo conclude, don't sacrifice this amazing opportunity because of \"social problems\". It's not worth trading an insanely rare chance to build skills in the prime of your development for some drinking buddies, and if you do that, it will only make you a weaker, more dependent person. You will have only proven to yourself that you cannot stand alone, that you lack self-belief. I hope this doesn't make you feel worse, but it's just the truth.",

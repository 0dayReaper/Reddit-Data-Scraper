    "postText": "I have a U-Haul truck, 3 boxes, a mini fridge,  a shelf, and some small misc. items. I need someone, (or 2 people realistically) to help me move my stuff  to my storage unit about 8 minutes away on Sunday, May 28. This entails putting the stuff into the truck and offloading it at the unit. Preferably someone that can drive, but I can drive if you don't have a license. Mostly I just need some strong hands. I'll pay you $100, but price is veryy negotiable.",

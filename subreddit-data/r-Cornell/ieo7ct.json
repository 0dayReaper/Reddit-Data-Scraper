    "postText": "  The year is 2037. \u201cAmerica\u201d is synonymous with \u201cCornell.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2020-2025 COVID-19 pandemic, Cornell was the only university to succeed in reopening, a Herculean effort that bankrupted every other university in the nation. With its multi-trillion dollar endowment it accumulated from the donations of billionaires from around the world, who lauded the success of the Big Red Vaccine, Cornell bought every other university in America. \n\nI\u2019m a 2036 graduate living in New York City. Today is job enrollment day. Since my enrollment window isn\u2019t until 4:00 PM, I decided to head down to the local Nasties to pick up some buffalo wings and signature Cornell ice cream. \n\nAs I\u2019m waiting in line, I overhear someone talking over the phone. It\u2019s some software engineer from my class bragging about his brand new six figure salary. He got lucky with his enrollment window. I just hope there are more CS slots left, but with my time window, I\u2019ll be lucky to land any engineering job. \n\nSuddenly, I hear the familiar chime of the nationwide intercom system. It\u2019s time for the national anthem. I immediately turn toward the nearest smiling portrait of President Martha Pollack, place my right hand over my heart, and belt out my loudest \u201cFar above Cayuga\u2019s waters...\u201d The man on the phone appears to pay no attention. He\u2019s immediately grabbed by secret CCCT agents standing in line and disappeared. \n\nAs I stand in line trembling, I can\u2019t help but selfishly hope that his job slot becomes available by my 4:00 enrollment window.\n\nBy the time I finish singing with a \u201cHail, all hail, Cornell!\u201d I\u2019m next in line. I make my order. \u201cThat\u2019ll be 25.00 BRBs,\u201d the AEP bot-cashier beeps. Since the collapse of the dollar back in \u201821, Big Red Bucks have been the official currency of the United States of Cornell. I swipe my ID card, but it gets declined. Oh no! I forgot BRBs don\u2019t roll over month-to-month. Embarrassed, I run back to my dorm room in Low Rise 21756. \n\nI check the time. It\u2019s 3:55 PM. I hop on my computer and enter my Net-ID: ab345287 and my password into Citizen Center. Before I enroll, I have time to vote in the annual presidential election. I click on the election tab, fully expecting the usual two options: Martha Pollack and Martha Pollack. But, to my surprise, I\u2019m instead offered the options of Martha Pollack and Walker White! He must\u2019ve hacked the election! I eagerly click on his name and submit my ballot. \n\nSuddenly, my internet goes out. *This must\u2019ve been a test, and I\u2019ve failed*, I think to myself while bracing against the back wall of my dorm room as I wait for the CCCT to bust down my door. But nothing happens. My internet comes back on. The ballot now has the two usual options. Dejected, I cast my vote for Martha Pollack and head to the enrollment page. \n\nIt\u2019s now 3:59. I\u2019m watching the second hand of the clock app on my phone. Just as it strikes 12, I click \u201cenroll.\u201d The page buffers. A minute passes. Then another. Finally, I\u2019m greeted with my career options. The only slots left are in the fine arts. Without a CS slot available, not even 56 years of programming experience could grant me a software engineering job. Crying, I choose to be a painter. My projected annual salary is 10,000 BRBs. I have 400,000 BRBs in student debt. Can I even pay monthly interest? \n\nBefore I can do the math, my door explodes and I\u2019m placed in handcuffs. \u201cCitizen,\u201d an officer addresses me, \u201cwith your projected annual salary of 10,000 BRBs, you will be unable to pay the annual 100,000 BRB citizen tuition. As such, you have been found in violation of Amendment 35 of the Cornell Compact. Your diploma is hereby null and void and you are to be expelled from Cornell immediately.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sent to Canada, where I decide to enroll in the newly founded community college known as Harvard, renowned for being a refuge for Cornell rejects.",

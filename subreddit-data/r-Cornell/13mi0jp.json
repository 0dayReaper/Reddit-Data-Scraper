I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m leaving campus tomorrow and will travel to different states in few coming days, but I can\u2019t get to the bottom of the fact why I feel like this. \nDoes anyone know what to do? It feels like I\u2019m helpless, hopeless, and no motivation to do anything. I feel life is like a chore of just doing tasks I\u2019m not enjoying. And speaking of enjoying, haven\u2019t really felt joy or excitement in a quite a time now. I feel like dying but I\u2019m not really dying. What is going on? Does anyone know?",

            "comment": "Sounds like you're entering/going through a depressive episode. Have you had difficulties with your mental health in the past? (Asking moreso for you to consider for yourself than to answer for me). \n\nRight now, you should focus on your needs; are you taking care of yourself physically? It's really easy to neglect the needs of your body when you feel this way, but it's important to remember that you will feel better after getting good sleep, taking a shower, or getting some exercise. And what about your mental health? Try to comfort yourself with things that bring you joy, indulge in your hobbies or hang out with people you love. You can also take to constructive ways to deal with your feelings, like journaling or venting to someone you trust. Remember that you are not the only person who has ever felt this way, and that you can get through this. \n\nIt would also be a smart decision to look at seeing a professional about how you're feeling. A trained therapist can help you work through the way you're feeling and find healthy ways for you to manage it if the feelings persist. \n\nIf you feel like you might hurt yourself and need someone to talk to, the suicide and crisis lifeline number is 988. You can dial that and be matched with a professional to help support you. You can also text \"HOME\" to 741741 to access the crisis text line. Please make sure you take care of yourself and be safe!",

I wonder if maybe the kind of therapy you went to/your specific therapist wasn't conducive to your treatment? Or perhaps you could look into seeing a psychiatrist and trying out medication. \n\nAnd again, make sure you're taking care of yourself. I don't know why your mental health has taking such a nosedive, but I do know that you were doing better before and you can get back to that state. Hoping for you that the process is swift.",

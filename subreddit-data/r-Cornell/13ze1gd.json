I understand you want to set your student up beforehand but if you are flying or sending the winter goods through the mail, then it would probably make sense to buy most things up here.  Ithaca has plenty of stores.  I bought a packet of wool socks in preparation for the winter,  brought them with me and really never used them.  To be honest a lightbox, or portable \"daylight\" box is more practical.  Winters aren't usually so snowy up here (there's often a light dusting  in the late afternoon, just enough to make it pretty, but not enough to need to shovel or wear boots) BUT...the winters can be long... and can wear you down.",

I feel like most people from California think about the snow, but not the rain.\n\nIt can rain anytime from the summer to spring to the fall. Many times, your kid won't want to wear the full ankle boots during the rain, especially if it's warm out. So a good pair of waterproof sneakers are good. I believe All Birds makes some, at least, that's what I used.",

Unless you're shoveling deep snow after a storm or want to do a hike in the woods in winter (something I highly recommend),  boots that come just over the ankle will be all you need.  They should be waterproof though.  I have a pair of knee high muck boots that I use when I have to shovel and only wear them a few times a year. Cornell does a very good job cleaning sidewalks and most paths (there are some that they don't maintain in winter).   A good wool hat (there are plenty of options at the book store) and good gloves are important too.  Snow in winters in Ithaca isn't so bad, but it can get brutally cold.",

You\u2019re not gonna want to wear a huge winter coat that you\u2019ll have to lug around the dining halls and libraries but you won\u2019t want to brave that with a hoodie.",

I would recommend heavy duty boots, but nothing so heavy that the student wouldnt be able to comfortably walk in for a whole day (theres a lotta walking). \n\nIn general cornell does a pretty good job clearning the snow on sidewalks and roads, so in theory you can sorta get by with running shoes or tennis shoes and thick socks ( wouldn't recommend though).\n\nSometimes, if they havent actually gotten the chance to get to fresh snowfall having thick treads is nice. \nI recommend layering and definitely get something for your ears (thick beanie).\n\nAs to actually having a winter coat, ive barely used mine outside of snowboarding (sorry mom). Instead i like having a thick long coat, a vest, a sweater, and a tshirt. Gives me enough options for various levels of air conditioning. Cornell buildings can get crazy hot.\n\nFor pants i just use sweats or jeans or the like. Most of your outside time in the cold is spent moving so having something that isnt too thick and actually slightly breathable is nice.\n\nJust my 0.02",

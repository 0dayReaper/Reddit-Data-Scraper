It's fun to bike down to the commons, it's fun to bike around the downtown area, but not so fun to bike back up.\n\nThe \"easiest route\" is to take a bus from the commons to campus, with your bike on the bike rack at the front of the bus.\n\nThe easiest actual bike route is University Ave, as u/turin-turambar21 said.",

I usually take University but I also have a nice alternate route:\n\nIf you can handle the initial steepest bit, I would take Cascadilla Park Rd. up and then bike through the cemetery and then up to turn left on Stewart. Then turn a sharp right through the rear service entrance that kinda leads you between Rose House and Hans Bethe House. Then you can either take the slope up (technically not allowed) or take Campus Rd up to Ho Plaza. From there, it flattens out quite a bit. \n\nThough other routes are faster or flatter or less complex, I feel this is probably the safest route. It kinda sucks to be breathing hard, going 5mph and getting close passed by a 30mph bus or distracted driver. Be safe out there!",

It\u2019s about the quality of a low rise I\u2019m ngl and can get hot during warmer days, but it\u2019s mostly cold in ithaca anyway. Common spaces are all in the basement/lowest floor, and the kitchen often got very cluttered by people\u2019s pans and plates that we got complaints all the time. If you keep your room/area clean, then it should be a good enough space for you to sleep and do work in.\n\nAlso totally random, but there was a food thief roaming about when I was there\u2026 so hopefully you won\u2019t have that situation if you decide to use any of the common spaces. \n\ntl;dr don\u2019t expect much. It\u2019s a standard bed and desk. Bathrooms are arguably better amenity there along with location on west next to dining halls and other west dorms.",

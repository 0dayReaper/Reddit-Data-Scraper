            "comment": "Here's a dirty secret in academia: Master's degrees are a cash cow for universities. In a lot of places, tuition dollars from MS students are directly subsidizing PhD student stipends and padding departmental numbers, so it's in the interest of a given department to admit as many Master's students as they can realistically manage.\n\nThat said, I think these three candidates would all be strong Master's candidates:\n\n* a person with a 3.1 GPA, undergrad research experience, and 3+ years of industry experience\n\n* a person with a 3.3 GPA with research and/or project team experience\n\n* a person with a 3.5 GPA without other relevant experience\n\nI personally fell into the first category, and felt that my time working in industry really helped me get the most out of my MS: it gave me focus, perspective, and helped a ton with thinking about project work on a longer time scale.\n\nStrong direct-admit PhD candidates would have higher GPAs as well as research experience. Note that if you want to get a PhD but your undergrad GPA isn't all that, starting with a Master's and getting good grades and perhaps a publication makes a great case for you to get into a doctoral program.\n\nOh, and in the words of so many friends of mine (including my spouse) who have gotten PhDs: don't get a PhD. It sucks. And if you know that people who have gone before you are telling you not to do it and you still, stubbornly, want to do it, then you'll be okay",

Most accepted students are 3.8 or above anecdotally.\n\nNevertheless, remember that graduate admissions are holistic and that no single gpa will make or break your chances depending on your other qualifications like LoRs or research experience.",

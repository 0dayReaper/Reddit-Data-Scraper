    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nI'm an international student planning a trip from NY to Ithaca in early June and I'm considering purchasing an Ourbus ticket. However, I have a concern regarding their luggage policy. According to the Ourbus website, they only allow one piece of luggage. BUT I'll be traveling with a large suitcase weighing 50 lbs, a carry-on bag weighing 25 lbs, and my trusty backpack. This means I'll have a total of three pieces of luggage. I'm wondering if anyone has traveled with Ourbus during the first days of June and managed to bring three pieces of luggage without any issues?\n\nthanks!",

            "comment": "You can put the 50 lb suitcase in the storage at the bottom of the bus, wear the backpack, and see if the 25 lb carry on bag will fit in overhead. If the bus isn\u2019t jam-packed, they might let you put the carry-on bag in the storage under the bus, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it. Alternatively, if you purchase 2 tickets, you\u2019re guaranteed 2 luggage spaces and won\u2019t need to worry about finding space for your carry-on.",

So you may be able to get away from the rule.  But be prepared to pay an extra ticket for your luggage.",

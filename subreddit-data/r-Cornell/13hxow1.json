    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman at CAS and the intended major I was accepted with was Economics. While I do love economics, my strongest point is math (played major role in my application) and I genuinely enjoy it too.\n\nEconomics, despite including some math, is largely theoretical and involves a certain degree of memorization (based on my experience with AP Macro- feel free to correct me if you have a different opinion). I want something like math that can produce a tangible result and involves the process of more direct problem-solving (one that u can do with less memorization and more with understanding and thinking).\n\nIn short, I'm pretty confident that I will major in Economics but double up or take a minor in another subject. Some subjects I'm considering are Data Science (minor), Applied Mathematics (minor), and Computer Science (double major/minor). Please recommend to me which subject I should take along with Economics. Thanks so much and I look forward to seeing you on August!",

Even as soon as beyond introductory, it is both very intuitive (meaning you can reason and not just memorize the answers) and math certainly starts entering. Also AP Macro is not at all a good proxy for what actual economics is like, since it compounds the most complex economics machinery into catchy words like \"aggregate demand.\" If you enjoy math, you can certainly approach the econ major with math in mind, and take more stats-related econ electives (or better yet, you can double major with math under the econ concentration). After a certain point, economics is boundless possibilities of econometrics regressions to choose from that certainly require problem-solving skills and not just brain-dead memorization.",

I think the math in economics will make you really, really disappointed as it barely goes beyond introductory calculus and statistics (even at the 4XXX level), and this is an experience reverberated by many math students with some experience in econ. I came into Cornell really enjoying both subjects but ended up becoming absolutely disillusioned with economics. \n\nIf you really enjoy math, don't expect economics to do any justice and take real math classes. I think CS and math departments are all very great at making you intellectually challenged, so you really can't go wrong with either.",

            "comment": "Advanced/Graduate Econ is math.  If you want to pursue deeper into advanced economics, you should take multivariable calculus, linear algebra, DE and probability theory.  And you definitely need real analysis. \n\nBelow is the recommendation by AEA: \n\n[https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/students/grad-prep/recommended-math](https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/students/grad-prep/recommended-math)\n\nAnd this is from subreddit of UChicago on applying to grad school: \n\n\" You will need a number of math-related credits from your undergraduate studies. Graduate study in economics follows a theorem-proof approach and uses rigorous notation, so the adcoms pay a lot of attention to how comfortable you look to be with pure mathematics. Two or three terms of calculus, and often linear algebra, are deemed minimum preparation; similarly a semester of mathematical statistics. \n\nFirst-year graduate courses draw heavily on real analysis. Background in real analysis is highly valued and indeed almost expected of a strong applicant. Real analysis is usually the first \"rigorous\" mathematics course, where you have to work through all proofs and write some yourself. The course is supremely effective preparation for initial graduate courses. \n\nIf you really want to delight the adcoms (you do), take metric spaces and functional analysis, too. When they see these and measure theory, perhaps even topology, they're rubbing their hands. Courses in differential equations are useful too, but if you have to choose in your final undergraduate years, the proof-based classes will always do more for you. \n\nEconomics up to intermediate micro- and macroeconomics is also preferred, but perhaps not as essential. In all these, you should have earned good grades. *Having taken too few math courses in college, or having performed poorly in them, rules you out of a top school.* \n\nApart from such coursework requirements, a formal major in economics is not necessary. In fact, the committee will view a math or physics major favorably, but anything \u2013 English, social work, Islamic studies \u2013 is fine as long as you demonstrate a strong aptitude for math.\"",

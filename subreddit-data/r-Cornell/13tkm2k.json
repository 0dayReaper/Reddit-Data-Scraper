Just make friends with other prefrosh in your class first. Once you\u2019re actually on campus and a real freshman, as someone else said, join clubs to get to know upperclassmen. Don\u2019t just randomly flag them down or dm them because you want to be their friend.\nEdit: Like rly I don\u2019t know what you expected. If you as a high school senior wouldn\u2019t let an 8th grader becoming a 9th grader join your inner circle, why would people in college be different?",

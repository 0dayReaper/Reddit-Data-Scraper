I'm kind of scared since I'm introverted around new people and apparently, donlon is known to be \"social\" and \"party\" halls(kinda scared). If anyone also got assigned there lmk and is it bad there @ donlon?",

Some say there\u2019s a strong sense of community there, but that\u2019s not unique to donlon lol. A lot of people are there by random assignment so you\u2019ll be fine",

            "comment": "old assignments are online at the standard course website urls (google!) but you will need to go back a few semesters. newest updated assignments are on Canvas and not publicly accessible. the online textbook already provides a huge amount of reference material! the videos are from Prof. Clarkson's remote semesters so you can basically just watch them to get the course content. i would expect lecture slides to be *significantly* less useful than textbook+videos. textbooks exercises are reasonable and answers are publicly available as well.",

I am moving to NYC for the summer for an internship and would love to meet other people to go to bars, clubs, museums, etc. I am an ecology student who loves to do just about everything (but I especially love DnD, punk/techno concerts, and thrifting).\n\n Let me know if you are in NYC and would like to meet up this summer!",

    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a current non-traditional community college student admitted to CoE for Environmental Engineering as a junior-year transfer. I\u2019ve had the amazing luck of being admitted to several other incredible schools and have narrowed my list down to Cornell, Duke, Stanford, and UC Berkeley.\n\nWhile Stanford and Berkeley are amazing schools, I\u2019m a bit concerned that neither of their Environmental Engineering programs are ABET accredited \u2013 which is why I\u2019m potentially leaning towards Cornell / Duke.\n\nEngineering students who are studying or have studied at Cornell \u2013 could you provide insights based on your academic experience as a student or on your post-grad endeavors? How important is ABET accreditation for the job market? Particularly if I want to work in government (i.e. NASA, DHS, FEMA, etc.) or policy?\n\nI\u2019d also really love to know\u2026\n\n* How is the Environmental Engineering program at Cornell? Is it really competitive and difficult?\n* What research opportunities in Environmental Engineering available to undergrads would you recommend that I look into?\n* Is it feasible to hold a part-time job while also completing your degree? I\u2019m currently working as a researcher at a gov agency and really want to continue working during the remainder of my undergrad experience.",

            "comment": "Might be a biased perspective, but ABET accreditation is a bit important. It helps to come from an ABET accredited school if you're looking to become a professional engineer and take the associated exams. \n\nThe environmental engineering program at Cornell is amazing. At least in my experience, it really is not that competitive on a personal level: the major is fairly small (\\~10-30ish people per year), so you get to at least vaguely know everyone, especially in upper level classes. While the coursework may be rigorous, the professors and staff are extremely chill in both CEE and BEE and excited to teach. If it's important to you, there's also a fair number of people in the department that had non-traditional career paths or at least nonlinear academic careers.\n\nI'm not sure what field of EnvE you're interested in, but there are a variety of research opportunities for most. The more obvious involves reaching out to professors in the department. Some other ones that come to mind are summer research opportunities with the Atkinson Center and the Water Resources Institute down in BEE. It's also pretty feasible to hold a part-time job while working, especially if you have prior experience juggling work and school and don't get too bogged down by other opportunities, though it might get a little challenging at certain times of the year.",

            "comment": "I second that ABET accreditation really is crucial. To work as a licensed environmental engineer, you need to have an ABET accredited B.S. degree. You then take the FE and eventually PE. These licenses are often job requirements for many environmental engineering jobs. Granted, it\u2019s possible to do other things with an EnvE degree, and many in our graduating class are pursuing non-EnvE things. But why limit yourself?\n\nI\u2019ve ping-ponged between our civil and environmental majors. Imo the EnvE side is the stronger side of the department. EnvE has the advantage of being in two departments and colleges (CEE in engineering and BEE in CALS). \n\nThere are so many courses related to both water quality and quantity, from the theoretical to the applied. We\u2019re the host of the NYS water resources institute so there\u2019s a significant emphasis on that. Cornell EnvE is well respected and connected to industry, and idk many people who struggle to find a job in EnvE after cornell. \n\nYou also get fairly involved in computational work (R, Matlab, Python, GIS) in a lot of courses, which gives you an awesome skill set. There\u2019s been a recent push to have more energy systems/renewables in the department as well. This is also great. It\u2019s fairly common to minor in something like MechE, InfoSci, CS, etc to really hone in on some other complementary skills. It\u2019s easy to minor. There\u2019s so much flexibility, which I love.\n\nJoining a research lab is incredibly easy at cornell, especially as an EnvE. It\u2019s a smallish major with a ton of professors. I think something like 50% of all cornell students in general do UG research. You\u2019ll find something for sure. Feel free to DM me for more specific advice on labs.\n\nI\u2019ve known people who held part time jobs, but their courseload had to be light to accommodate it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to do Cornell research and a part time job though. You wouldn\u2019t really have time for extracurriculars imo.\n\nMy (biased) opinion is to choose Cornell. I think our EnvE program is really quite good, and only getting better with time. There are just so many resources here.",

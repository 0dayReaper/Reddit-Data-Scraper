What are the courses like (workload, homework, prelim/finals), and which would be easier to succeed in with a heavy courseload?\n\nI was also considering taking it over the summer but they offer only BIOMI 2900. Anyone have experience with 2900 over the summer?",

The class was well-organized and there were a lot of resources for the students. I cannot speak on BIOMI2900 as I have not taken it.",

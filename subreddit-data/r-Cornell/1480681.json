    "postText": "l'm a recently admitted transfer student coming from an out-of-state community college. I'm a \"servant-leader\" personality type. I enjoy working in teams and supporting my team mates to bring out the best in them and myself. However, I'm also good at lone-wolfing it when I have to. I guess, I'm trying to get a vibe for what the Cornell experience will be like and this is the best place for that. So what do you say? Collaborative or competitive?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1480681)",

In research/project teams (at least if you find the right one), teams tend to be pretty fun since everyone is actually passionate Abt the project.",

As a transfer last year I was pretty lonely and felt like I wasn't measuring up to the people around me, but after some time it got a lot easier when I just found the right friends. If I could offer some advice it would be:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake initiative and ask some people in your classes to do homework together regularly, it'll help you do better in the class, help you make some friends, and teach you that the other students aren't perfect. Back before I made friends I kept assuming everyone understood the material way easier than I did and once I started talking to my classmates I realized we were all confused and we helped each other understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind some extracurriculars that are fun. I know there are a lot of skill building/resume enhancing ones that people gravitate towards and in my experience these were pretty competitive but you also just need to give yourself room to breathe and make friends outside of class. If you're looking for suggestions, I'd def recomend the concert commission :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGive it time! My first semester was really lonely, but that changed after giving the relationships I was forming time to develop. You will find your place here. Welcome to the University :)",

The people are amazing in PARADIM and are so collaborative it's really special. I don't think this is true for Cornell as a whole but I am extremely lucky to be a part of a department/group that is. I hope everything goes well for you op.",

But SHP plus meant I could continue receiving health coverage, getting medical care and dental care (signed up for that) and more. It was so amazing having this option and for it to be taken away from students is absolute BS. I\u2019ll be writing to whoever runs SHP to help protest this decision. An alternative either needs to be picked, or this program should be reinstated.",

    "postText": "SciFi Lab is currently recruiting participants on **May 21 (Sunday)** and **May 22 (Monday)** for our research project: using glasses equipped with sensors under nose to recognize silent speech, tongue gestures and breathing patterns.\n\nDuring the experiment, we will ask you to wear a pair of glasses with microphones and speakers attached to it, and silently mouth commands according to instructions on the screen. The study should last **1.5 hour** and you will receive **$15 compensation** for completing the study. The study will take place at **G25 Gates Hall**.\n\nWe will strictly follow the instructions published by Cornell University and local health administrations to mitigate the viral transmission risk, including minimizing human-to-human interactions and disinfecting any device and furniture used in the study.\n\nTo participate, \n\n1. You must be 18 years or older.\n2. Please expect audio/video recordings, including recordings of your face. These recordings will not be shared outside the research team of this project.\n3. You must not be severely near-sighted (if you can wear contact lenses during the study it is okay). You must be able to read the computer screen when wearing our eyeglasses.\n\nPlease select a 1.5-hour slot on this spreadsheet (you can just highlight it, if a slot has already been highlighted, it means it's not available): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLQQYy9j-mc5lTjzpqjGBxAvJfLvDDoARriraWPCHA4/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLQQYy9j-mc5lTjzpqjGBxAvJfLvDDoARriraWPCHA4/edit#gid=0)\n\nIRB protocol: IRB0009898 (2010009898)\n\nIf you have any questions about the project, please contact Sissel Sun ([rs923@cornell.edu](mailto:rs923@cornell.edu)) or Claire Zhou ([xz256@cornell.edu](mailto:xz256@cornell.edu)), or faculty advisor Prof. Cheng Zhang ([chengzhang@cornell.edu](mailto:chengzhang@cornell.edu)).\n\nHave a nice summer!",

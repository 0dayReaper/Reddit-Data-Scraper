    "postText": "I'm in the process of moving out of my NYC apartment a month early (graduation/travel reasons), and if anyone is looking to find an apartment lease from May 25 - June 30 for summer internship, I'm totally available to give out my room. Fully furnished, with in-unit dryer and washer. DM me and I'll give you more information :) Price is negotiable, as I'm also trying to recoup some loss of leaving early.",

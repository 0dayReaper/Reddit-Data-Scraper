If you took it separately (not as a HS class) then there\u2019s a long ass form you\u2019ve gotta fill out. It is the most horrible process to complete. I had to do it for 3 chem classes from different schools.",

So it\u2019s on my high school transcript and on my college transcript. Kinda confusing. I rather to the form then to take both calc again \ud83e\udd72",

Locally, Dual Enrollment means you took college classes at the college or university and the credit and grades are counted on your High school transcript.  I understand the requirement that the course be taken at a college and be taught by a college with traditional college students.  Not counting it because it showed up on your high school transcript is silly.",

But if you have them on a cc transcript I believe they'd approve it unless I forgot something. I  took a calc 3 course at a cc my senior year just seperate from high school credit as dual enrollment and had no problems getting credit for it. You may have to contact the math department if it doesn't come up properly and they compare syllabi to cornell ones to approve classes at other colleges.",

I took 4 courses as a dual enrollment student and it didn\u2019t even show up on my cornell CALS credit transfer evaluation thing which all of them were done separately at a cc. The courses are both on my high school transcript and cc transcript. But I will definitely ask them directly. Thanks!!",

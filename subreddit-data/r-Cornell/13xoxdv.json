            "comment": "Transfers ask this question every year and I feel like the comments are usually confusing. Pretty much all non freshmen live on west. The rest live on north and then south of all else fails. If you\u2019re humec, most of your classes are gonna be near mvr which is pretty conveniently accessible from north, but isn\u2019t too far off from west (15 minutes opposed to maybe 10). You do have to deal with the slope on west however. I\u2019m not sure if you can rank individual buildings or just campuses, but here\u2019s an outline:\n\nWest is broken up into the main buildings which are maybe 15 years old and have AC in the halls and dining halls in every building. Becker has ac in the rooms as well. There are then the west gothics which you don\u2019t want. They\u2019re ancient and don\u2019t have ac. \n\nNorth is where all the freshmen live. If I had to guess I\u2019d say it\u2019s 70% freshmen but I have no idea. You guys have two dining halls that are reliably okay but don\u2019t have much variation. Some of the buildings like ganendago are really new (and I think all upperclassmen this year) but some are really old and are gonna suck. \n\nSouth has nothing going for it. It\u2019s like a ten minute walk to the west dining halls unless you want to go to the unequivocally worst dining hall on campus on central maybe 7 minutes away. If you plan on only getting takeout from ctown, you can maybe start to even consider living on south. It\u2019s also about as far away as you could possibly live from the humec building. It\u2019s only close to the engineering quad\n\nOverall, go for west first and then north. It\u2019s what everyone does. People on here seem to make it sound like a close race with pros and cons to consider which I don\u2019t really see it as.",

The pay is not great if you are in a field with an industry equivalent. Some people like the idea but not the reality of living in a small cold town. Some areas (administration in particular) encourage moving from school to school. A postdoc spouse who is the other half of a two-body problem. People who move here for a job may like to move around in general, and the town is small enough that it can\u2019t recruit certain specialized skills from within the community.  \n\nThere are a lot of staff members who stick around, though; I was recently in a meeting with some fellow staff members where we got talking about  how long we\u2019d been here (10-40 years.) People with kids are much more likely to stay, as are folks with relatives in the area, as are folks who spent time in the area before moving here for a job.",

Often because there aren\u2019t as clearly defined growth paths.\n\nSpeaking from experience, you can wait around for 7-10 years for when a promotion might materialize (no matter how hard you work and how much you contribute) or you can move every 2-3 years and get 2-3 promotions during the same period.\n\nWith salaries being lower in higher ed, rare or nonexistent bonus structures, and raises not even keeping pace with inflation, doing this is almost a necessity if you\u2019re trying to support a family and grow in your career.",

            "comment": "I'm currently outgoing staff so I don't really have anything to lose anymore. I completed my undergrad at Cornell and then worked here as staff for ten years.\n\nCornell is terrible long term. Cornell relies on being the only place to work in Ithaca with decent benefits, so the hourly wage is trash. The only way to stay above inflation and the cost of living is jumping departments every two years because raises are pennies. There's no effort on retention anymore, Cornell's main tactic is to overload you with work, burn you out, and replace you with fresh meat. This has been the tactic since 2008 during that big crash- this was when Cornell tossed a lot of employees and combined jobs, and decided that was a great tactic. Now if someone leaves a job, they twiddle their thumbs for about a year, if you can keep up with the workload- Surprise! They aren't going to hire anyone now. You're doing great. Meanwhile, you're drowning, you were just keeping the department going until they hired someone, now help is never coming. The stress destroys your health- mental and physical, now you're on a health leave. Now Cornell places you in a temp job so they can post your job and get fresh meat in. Rinse and repeat. Maybe your major is popular and the student population is greater than what the staff can manage and you've been begging for additional staff to manage it, the work is there, the data is there, but naaah we're broke! Ten billion in the bank but broke! So sorry, no money! Drown, bitch!\n\nI love advising students, I love telling them everything I've learned over the years, I love sharing how to work around bureaucratic issues, I love ensuring they have a better undergrad experience than I did. Fuck this place. There's so much potential and they just crush it. I'm still mad about how we fail our students we place on required leaves without mental health support.",

I don't know what the actual turnover rate is overall, but it's going to be higher in some job types or areas of Cornell, and lower in others.  My guess is that it's not actually all that high, and that it's just noticeable in some places.  It's also possible we're seeing a post-pandemic bump as things shake out in the \"new normal.\"",

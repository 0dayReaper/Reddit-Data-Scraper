    "postText": "Hi everyone I just wanted to make an announcement and give people something to be excited about.  \n\nI met my girlfriend in an engineering class freshman year and we spent a lot of time together doing problem sets over the years in Duffield.  This meant many late nights together where we grew closer and developed a strong love for each other.  \n\nI've made the decision I want to marry her and I think it's only fitting that I propose to her on the last day of classes (this Friday) in the Duffield atrium at around 12:30PM in the open area near the doors that lead outside to the engineering quad.  If some people are ready with cameras to record this, I will appreciate it since I know we'll remember this day forever.  \n\nFull disclosure: Even though she's an engineer, I know she hasn't been on Reddit in forever so I'm not concerned about her seeing this in the next couple of days.",

Also, for additional perspective, a lot of women actually prefer a more private proposal - ideally in a place that's special to both of you but not busy/crowded with strangers. Every girl in my circle (good mix of intro/extroverts) whom I've talked to about this prefers a sweet, private proposal over grand, public gestures. Of course, you know her better but just something to consider.",

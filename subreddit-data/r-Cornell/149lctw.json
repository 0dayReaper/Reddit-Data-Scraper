    "postText": "SHP Plus will discontinue on June 30, 2023. [This document](https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2023-06/Discontinuation%20of%20SHP%20Plus%20QA%20061423%20FINAL.pdf) from Cornell has FAQs, including why the program was being discontinued, which I will include in this post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;SHP Plus formed nearly a decade ago as a pilot program offered in partnership between the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and Cornell University to support Medicaid-eligible students with no-cost health coverage. NYSDOH provided $2M annually to fund the pilot program.  Budget constraints have caused the state to streamline its managed care vendors and products.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;NYSDOH decided to end its partnership with Cornell, sunsetting the SHP Plus program June 30, 2023. Per NY state law, any insurance product can be discontinued at any time, and the insurer must pay for claims for 30 days upon announcement of the discontinuance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlt link: [https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2023-06/Discontinuation%20of%20SHP%20Plus%20QA%20061423%20FINAL.pdf](https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2023-06/Discontinuation%20of%20SHP%20Plus%20QA%20061423%20FINAL.pdf)",

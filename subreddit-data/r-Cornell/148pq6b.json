    "postText": "Can anyone please share with me the syllabi of:\n\nECE 5/4750 - Computer Architecture\n\nAEM 2100 - Introductory Statistics (or something similar)\n\nPHYS 7684 or 4481 - Quantum Information Processing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I know, it's a lot to request all at once, but I figured it would be less nagging than 3 separate posts...  \nAnd the professors have not answered me :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, does anyone know what courses teach data processing and analysis for machine learning?  \nI.e., topics like PCA, CCA, unsupervised neural networks, etc.\n\nI only found Numerical Methods for Data Science (CS 6241) but I don't have its syllabus so not sure if it fits",

    "postText": "Hey!! I'm a UK student doing a research project at Cornell over the summer, flying into new york and out of Boston. I've booked a new york -&gt; ithaca flight, but I'm absolutely stuck on how to get from Ithaca -&gt; Boston - i know you can fly from syracuse, but I can't find any regular public transport there (my american friends say I can't just expect there to be a bus service lol). Anyone have any ideas? I'll be going to boston at the end of July. Thank you in advance from a very confused brit!!",

It\u2019ll be faster and much cheaper than flying to Syracuse and waiting for an ourbus there. This is not a public bus so you can\u2019t just show up. You need to buy tickets online. However that can be as soon as same day as long as there are still open seats",

    "postText": "Hi! I am an incoming sophomore transfer at Cornell and have just received my housing assignment for the Schuyler House. After looking at Reddit for reviews of this place, I am a bit unsettled. My main worry at Cornell is having a good friend group and community, and most people say that Schuyler isn't ideal for that. Would anyone be able to reassure me or give any positive stories about Schuyler? Additionally, the housing assignment states that the license starts on 8/17. However, my family has already booked airline tickets planning for moving in on August 14th or 15th, based on what we saw online regarding the new student move-in dates. Is there any way we can ask the office to allow me to move in earlier?",

You probably read posts from me.\n\nRealistically your dorm isn't going to affect your ability to have a social group, at least it didn't for me. Schuyler is annoying, don't get me wrong, but the main difference is you have a few blocks commute. That's really it.\n\nIf you're seriously worried about it, get an ebike with a removable battery so you can charge it in the dorm and you'll have more mobility than 99% of students.",

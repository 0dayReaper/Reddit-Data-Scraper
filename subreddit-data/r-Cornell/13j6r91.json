    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for female subletter/reletter to take over my lease for the summer from June 2023 to July 2023. The apartment is fully furnished and rent includes amenities such as water, flat screen TV, trash, cable, and high speed internet access. The only utilities you need to pay is for electricity. It\u2019s a 3 minute walk to West Campus and there is a TCAT bus stop in front of the leasing office as well as another bus stop for 10 about 2 minutes away that runs every 20 minutes. Laundry is within the facility and parking is available with a fee if you do have a car. \n\nThe rent is $710 per month (but willing to negotiate!) for the medium sized room (closest to the kitchen) in the apartment. The apartment does not come with air conditioning, but if you sublet/relet with me, you can have a window AC unit free of charge that was originally $210. You will also most likely be living alone during this time as well. \n\nPlease private message me if you\u2019re interested or have questions!",

But Olin Library is an architectural travesty and a total eyesore on the otherwise picturesque Arts Quad. I still can't stand the sight of Olin Library after all these years.\n\nIn fact, the best view of the Arts Quad is from the sixth floor of Olin.  That way your eyes don't have to be insulted by the ugly concrete box of Olin.\n\nBTW, this is a nice winter picture.  But it would be much nicer if it was taken from Olin.",

People who can afford this college think that everyone is blowing this needs based thing out of proportion but IVs should never just just be for the rich and the white which is what 100% needs based should fix but the system doesn\u2019t work unless you actually make it blind.  I admit this school looks super pretty in the winter but this isn\u2019t a view made for the rich and the white.  Everyone deserves an opportunity for a good education.",

There is a rotten duality we deal with here.\n\nSince some of us are born deeply fortunate in our circumstances, we are bound to help lift others up onto \u201cthe porch\u201d we inhabit upon this hill. \n\nHope you can forgive my glib response \u2014 having misunderstood your intent. \n\nThere is much work to be done; alas, I am not involved with the dirty work of University Admissions as much as I once was \u2014 which was never much. \n\nWith love and respect,\n\n~Alice",

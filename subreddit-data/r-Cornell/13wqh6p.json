There is lab in one of the AAP buildings I believe but it\u2019s pretty hard to get access to. \n\nMy go to was just mailing from Uncle Marty\u2019s to either Indie Film Lab (the best online darkroom) or thedarkroom.com (not as good but a little cheaper)\n\nYou can also drop off at Walmart but they send out your film, you don\u2019t get your negs back and their scans are shit (and you can\u2019t even rescan in Olin using one of their film scanners at higher quality bc they throw away your negs).\n\nIf you want to try developing your own film Olin has scanners that can scan film. You might need to ask a few staff members where they are and where the proper inserts are because not all the staff know about them but they are there! It\u2019s also good if you wanna save some money and do develop only on an online lab just make sure you ask them to cut your film or you will have to do it yourself.",

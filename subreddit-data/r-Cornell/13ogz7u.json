The past week I've been frantically searching for a sublet, joined 10+ fb groups, made 20+ inquiries, but no luck so far. I have about a week left to move to the city with no prospects \ud83d\ude2d If anyone has a place in Manhattan available 5/29-6/17 please reach out I'm willing to pay for a month if that helps. (Also I'm a girl if that's relevant)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: thanks to everybody's help and support I found a place! just seeing everyone's comments and messages made the search so much easier &lt;3 Cornell and Ithaca can be a tough place at times but these are moments that make me love this community so so much. I'll leave this post in case other people looking for nyc housing can benefit from the resources!\n\nAlso I found another studio available from now-August in UES (clean and luxurious) in case any girl is looking for one!!",

Jersey City is an easy Path ride (NJ-NY subway) to NYC with stops from JC to World trade Center (downtown), 8th st (Greenwich Village), 14th st, 23rd St and 33rd st., all on the West side of town.  You can also get a quick bus to 42nd st.  Jersey City is as close to midtown as Brooklyn and there's plenty to do there.",

The person who posted it with Cornell said you can reach out directly to him: Steven Couras, scouras@StPeters.edu    \n\nSo, St. Peters is about 8 blocks from the Journal Sq Path which goes to NYC 24/7 but it can be rough late at night.

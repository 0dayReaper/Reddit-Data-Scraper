    "postText": "Hello, \n\nsorry to interrupt your memes, trust me it's not something I enjoy doing, but in this chaotic moment I feel compelled to write this. \n\nI am a dining employee from Willard Straight Hall in my first year working for Cornell Dining. I wanted to take a moment away from all of the craziness that is happening this semester to show my appreciation for the students of Cornell.   \n\n\nWhen I first accepted my position at Cornell, I was terrified at the thought of working around so many people. I have had social anxiety issues for over a decade now, and having a constant reminder of the bad in the world through media has never made things easier for me. Making the step to work for Cornell Dining was a huge hurdle for me mentally that I still struggle with from time to time, but I can tell you, that those days are becoming less and less the longer I work at Cornell. A large part of why these days are becoming less frequent is due to the outstanding character of the students of Cornell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are so many of you that I get to make pizzas for on a daily basis. I see many of you multiple times a week, and even the few of you that I only get to interact with every once in a while constantly remind me how great the Cornell community is! I've worked in food service since I was 16 years old and in every other job I've worked, I've always felt like I'm \"just the guy making this persons food\", however; that changed significantly when I started working at Cornell. At Cornell, there hasn't been one time where I have felt disrespected, or just felt like the guy making your food. I constantly feel as though many of you genuinely care about us dining employees, and you truly appreciate the effort we make!  \n\n\nI probably wouldn't have ever made this post until this last week. With all the chaos, and madness surrounding the Coronavirus and what it means for everyone on campus one thing became shockingly clear to me, there is no where else in the world I'd rather be working right now than Cornell. In a time where many of you are scared, and worried about what comes next for you, a lot of you still took a moment to ask a lot us dining employees what all of this meant for us and our jobs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have never felt more cared for by strangers in my life than I have felt this week. A student even took the time to write our bosses an email saying how much they appreciated the work we have done for them, and the seamless transition we made to make our dining halls as safe as we possibly can during this time. If you happen to read this, I want to make sure you know that your letter made so many people feel good about what we do, there were tears in the eyes of multiple people in the room as the email was read aloud to all of us. This moment is incredibly scary for us as we aren't sure exactly whats going to happen to dining over the next couple of weeks since it seems like everything could change an hour from now but knowing that there is an entire campus of students who genuinely care about our well being honestly means the world to us all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, due to all of this craziness, I hate the fact that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to many of the seniors who have already left campus that I was able to make food for regularly and at many points get to have conversations with. If any of you happen to be reading this, I wish you all nothing but the absolute best and I'm so sorry you're not able to spend your last semester as I'm sure you envisioned it, but there is no doubt in my mind that many of you are going to change the world for the better since many of you have already done that for my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for allowing me to share my thoughts and serve you all. I look forward to seeing you all when everyone can come back to campus, I know things are crazy right now but I have nothing but faith in you all to absolutely crush it for the remainder of this semester...now back to the memes.",

I wish you and the rest of the dining team good health and positivity! I always remember my interactions with dining professionals during my undergraduate experience and many of them helped me find many bright spots in my days.",

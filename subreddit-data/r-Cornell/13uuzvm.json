    "postText": "I\u2019ve been stressing myself out heavily lately over being in CALS InfoSci rather than CS, because of CS career oriented subreddits. I never even thought about it until I started exploring CS subreddits, since IS fits my interests so much better, I love my classes and my advisor, and I\u2019m finally making good progress towards finishing my degree after a tumultuous last few years in an engineering major I didn\u2019t want to be in. I can\u2019t narrow down my interests at all between design and SWE and it seemed like this major is a good place to be for interdisciplinary pursuits and flexibility. I assumed I\u2019d only need to work on projects and work on my leetcode skills. But hiring managers on SWE and resume subreddits keep saying that non-CS majors are filtered out of the hiring pool with the press of a button before they ever even get to interview, that companies won\u2019t take chances on non-CS SWEs, that if I want to be a SWE I have to be a CS major or else be forced to get a CS master\u2019s or postbacc, that InfoSci is seen as a CS dropout major, and that companies won\u2019t spend the time and energy vetting people they could simply not consider for having the wrong degree. I feel really broken and lost after weeks of reading all this. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to choose between SWE or design before the time comes for my last opportunities to change majors and/or get an internship, as I am a rising junior now. Switching into CS would mean changing my Fall semester to accommodate 2800, 3410, taking Math 1120 for no credits because I got a D in 1910, taking a foreign language, and more. It would mean losing my advisor and degree progress and not having the room to take classes in design or psychology or elsewhere again. I don\u2019t know what to do and I am lost and in crisis. And I just don\u2019t want to be in CS since SWE was originally this backup plan that I now feel immense pressure to funnel into a precisely defined tech job within and give up on everything else, due to the weight of loans and fear of being unemployable. I really need advise from IS grads and CS grads and people who know what it\u2019s like after university here",

How I like to think about it is that if the hiring managers are going to just filter you out by major, then the job isn\u2019t going to be right for you anyway.  IS is a great major because of its unique interdisciplinary approach.  You\u2019ll probably hate just sitting in front of a computer and writing code.  There are so many other fulfilling and high paying jobs at companies outside of SWE.  For example, UI/UX designer, project manager, etc.\n\nAlso, have you looked at the [Cornell careers outcome](https://ccs.career.cornell.edu/dash/dashboard_career) dashboard?  You\u2019ll see that IS majors still go down many of the same paths and companies as CS majors.  You can also work for a startup, which will give you the freedom to pursue more of what you enjoy.\n\nAt the end of the day, my advice is to never ever EVER deviate from what you enjoy.  It sounds like you really love the IS major for many reasons.  Pursue what you love and good things will follow from there :)",

Sure, there may be some (though I'm guessing not a ton) of companies who will filter out non-CS majors from their entry-level positions which are very focused on SWE, but if you like SWE and take the core of the CS classes, you'll be fine long-term.   \nAnother thing to remember is that you'll be graduating from one of the top STEM schools in the US (and the world actually), so you're already in the the 99th percentile and are essentially the cream of the crop; most employers know this. You will not end up unemployable and unable to pay your loans, I promise you. As long as you have decent social skills, you'll be fine. In fact, most companies, for most positions, would actually prefer someone who had a 3.2 GPA and excellent soft-skills, over someone who had a 3.8 GPA and poor soft-skills. Once you have a few years in the workforce, you'll see how important soft-skills are, and why it's so important to be a good teammate, and have good teammates.",

            "comment": "As a senior this year, I switched from being a more Data Science focused CS major to SWE, and I feel you quite a bit on not being exactly tailored for SWE positions, though the degree of transition is certainly less. \n\nThere are a few considerations you should also keep into consideration before you make very large decisions like this. Firstly, the nature of job postings and their strictness depends on a lot on the state of the economy. In good times, people are a lot more open to candidates, and in a bad economy, a lot more jobs will require masters, possibly multiple internships in the specific subfield of the job and higher GPAs. Since the CS job market is pretty bad right now, there is more of the second going around, though who knows what the economy will be like when you are a senior? Secondly, there is a lot more diversity among employers than you perhaps think. Different hiring managers and companies recruit for different sets of skills. Some companies may expect you to have a lot of experience with their tech stack and are quite strict about requirements, while others are looking for drive, and expect you to learn a lot on the job. You tend to hear about the first category more on Reddit. Finally, I think there is a good bit of differentiation between people in the same major. The CS majors who do exceptionally well in their courses, have multiple top-tier internships, did research etc. etc. will have more opportunities and get a lot more interviews than those did the requirements and not that much more. \n\nWith those general comments out of the way, it sounds like switching to CS would impose very high costs to reduce a supposed disadvantage of being an Info Sci major. Have you spoken to career advising for Info Science and CS at Cornell? It seems like they would have a stronger sense of what the actual degree of any actual disadvantage would be, rather than people on Reddit. \n\nIf it turns out that any degree of disadvantage is not that large, one option you can also consider is just taking more core CS classes rather than entirely switching majors (i.e. CS 2110, CS 3110, CS 4820), which would at the very least mean you don't have to deal with the language requirement, which would suck up time for little benefit. \n\nFinally, in terms of personal experience, I think a lot of this kind of stuff is often mainly in your head. You don't feel qualified, so you don't apply as much, are nervous on interviews, and this makes the problem worse. While you certainly run into hiring managers who are very specific in the candidates they are looking for, and my situation is somewhat different than yours, I was personally suprised by the diversity of hiring managers out there. \n\nMoreover, I think it is really hard to try to prep for multiple career tracks simultaneously. For me, I was considering both DS and SWE for a long time, and they for example have different interview questions. As such, I tried preparing for both, which made me be bad at both sets of interviews. I think you would be a lot better off if you can figure out soon which of the two paths you want to take, since if you try to do both, you are likely to do both sub-optimally.",

Ideally see if I can leverage my UX background as a plus for a frontend dev to have over other candidates who can\u2019t speak design. Also I have fortunately already taken CS 1110, 2110, and 3110, so my CS background is pretty solid already and I intend to go on to take several more CS electives and maybe dig deeper into the core to at least have the CS MEng prereqs done in the event that I can find financial aid for that. If it\u2019s a matter of proving myself through projects and in interviews, and of taking the right CS courses, I feel confident I can do that, but it was all the talk about degree titles and being filtered before even being given a chance that was really breaking me.",

It\u2019s definitely harder to find an opportunity but I doubt your major affects it. Some may filter you out sure but I firmly believe that as an IS major, if you\u2019re focusing on UI/UX design, you can definitely land a frontend design position. More specifically, if you have a combination of both design and basics of frontend coding (knowing like CSS, HTML, and some modern frameworks like ReactJS, Vue, Angular, Bootstrap) and have some experience in using these things, your odds of getting a frontend SWE are as good as any other SWE (cause in the end experience is what counts).",

                    "comment": "No. InfoSci is an entirely distinct degree defined pretty heavily by the concentrations one pursues and how they build their studies. Interactive Technologies, one of the most popular concentrations, has a lot of CS overlap and is where the types of people you mention often funnel into. But IMO the strongest reason to switch into InfoSci and the concentration furthest apart from CS is User Experience. UX Designers design the experience a user goes through when using a product or service, and usually do not engage in any actual coding whatsoever. The IS UX program here is really cool and feeds into FAANG UI/UX Design positions and other product adjacent roles. A CS degree would teach you nothing relevant to UX and is favored below HCI/UX degrees and Psychology degrees. Besides the UX program, I was actually initially in Digital Culture &amp; Production because it would allow me to take more creative courses like the Game Design classes and the Computer Graphics classes, as opposed to pure CS theory. Concentrations like Behavioral Science, UX Design, and Digital Culture &amp; Production are a lot more human-facing than CS\u2019s theoretical program, but IS doesn\u2019t even just offer purely CS or UX related stuff: The Information Ethics, Law, and Policy concentration is a straight up pre-law degree with no overlap with either CS nor UX as subjects.",

Does this affect my chances at grad school or getting into the M.Eng program? Am I just fucked, since there's nothing I can do about it now?\n\nReally disappointed in myself.",

They'll just ask your overall GPA.\n\nWhen you get to grad school (though I don't know about the M.Eng.), you'll have to prove general / core knowledge in a bunch of areas, such as theory, electronics, systems, programming, and so on.  Typically you'll just take a not very hard test (if you have the background, you should be able to pass it without studying), but if you can't, you'll have to take a class or two to meet the requirement.  As I recall, my grad school had 6 areas, and I passed the test in 4 but took the course for two (non-digital electronic circuits and AI).\n\nThat said, if you want to go to grad school in computer science (though not so much if you just want to pursue the software engineering side), that (along with your other theory courses) are important knowledge to have.  I recommend reading \\_Godel, Escher, Bach\\_ to get a broad background in theory.  I recommend starting to look at the GRE in computer science (assuming that still exists), and that will give you a good idea of what is expected knowledge (hint: a lot from the theory classes).  I'll humble brag that I got an 800 on the CS GRE (but still did not get accepted into UC Berkeley CS grad school, but went to UIUC).",

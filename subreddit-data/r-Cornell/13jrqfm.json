Lots to do, beautiful weather, and the town is less crowded. Definitely go to Ithaca Festival, especially the parade. There are usually Friday night concerts on the arts quad, and Thursday night concerts on the Commons. Go for a hike, eat lunch outside. Everyone\u2019s in a good mood, strike up a chat with whoever. It\u2019s great.",

Sometimes I'll come home from school too tired to make food and will just not eat that day.\n\nAlso the department usually has 2-3 seminars a week where they'll have food. So thats 2-3 a week I don't have to worry about making food.\n\n\nSo my day looks something like this:\n\nBreakfast: skip\n\nLunch: seminar food or 1 ramen noodles (3.7$/12 ~ 0.3$ each) + chicken (2$/lbs I usually eat like 1/2 lbs at a time)+ fries (3.5$ for a bag. Idk I think 1 bag will last me 3-4 meals)\n\nDinner: Bread with 1 slice of cheese with an apple (idk 1$)\n\nSometimes I'll be too hungry to fall asleep (usually happens on days where I skipped lunch) in that case I'll eat another cheese sandwich or an apple and that will usually be enough.\n\nAs for how I arrive at the number. I only go to walmart every other week and budget so that I dont spend more 100$ (because I can't afford to spend more than that)",

We are trying to rein in our own food costs and honestly with our habits such a low bill is probably not likely, but there is always room for improvement.\n\nBiggest challenge for us is lack of time leading to eating a lot of prepared foods, we rarely eat out or get takeout but do get frozen and other prepared meals from the supermarket.  Trying to eat a lot more cheap filling things like potatoes, rice, and noodles.  A big pan of veggie fried rice with just a touch of chicken is pretty cheap for example.  Anyway thanks for sharing",

It\u2019s considerably cheaper than ctown and honestly you\u2019re not really missing out on much\u2026 if you wanna go to ctown just walk. For example I paid $950/ month for a 3b1br pretty deep into ctown whereas next year I\u2019m paying $625/ month for a 4b2br on north, and my place on north is closer to campus. \n\nFood I would budget roughly $75 a week, if you\u2019re smart with where/ how you buy you can do it for less. The ithaca walmart is pretty cheap and still good quality for most things and it\u2019s not sketchy in the slightest, honestly prefer it over Tops which is roughly in the same price range.",

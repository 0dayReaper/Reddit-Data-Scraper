    "postText": "Basically the title. I'm a Statistical Science major (CAS) interested in data science and such, and am trying to avoid the proofs of MATH 2210, would there be any disadvantage from taking 2940 first before 2930? CAS math track typically does linear algebra first but a lot of my Eng friends do 2930 first so just curious. Thanks in advance!",

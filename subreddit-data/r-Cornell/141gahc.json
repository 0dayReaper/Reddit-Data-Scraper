I tried to take 2800 in my 3110 semester but found I was falling behind fast and struggled to grasp proof-based maths. I know 3410 has a reputation and 4820 has one as well, and have heard 4410 is an average amount of work but wouldn\u2019t know what to expect with 4411.\n\nEdit: I know 4340 isn\u2019t offered in Fall 2023 so I will probably postpone this to my senior year and wrap up my InfoSci reqs in the coming two semesters, or just swap it out for something else",

I am curious about OS dev and heard that 4410 itself involves little actual coding at all while 4411 has you build a small OS through the semester. But if it\u2019s too much work for a semester, I don\u2019t need to have a prac done at all as an IS major and can just do CS 4820 4410 Info 4400 and a fourth CALS credit course like Magical Mushrooms.",

In your case, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly worth it tbh. That being said, you can still enroll in it and drop it if you don\u2019t find it interesting/too much work.",

Also in part because my interests are so varied and I can\u2019t choose between SWE and UI/UX, much less something specific within them, so comp arch and OS foundations might help if I decide I don\u2019t want to keep working with web technologies. I\u2019m still taking some non-Core CS electives directly towards my major before senior year, including Data-Driven Web Apps, Computer Graphics, and Computer Vision.",

I was also in 21 credits overall that semester so slightly different case cause I had lots of other stuff going on. I\u2019d say it\u2019s not totally unrealistic but 3410 is harder than 3110 and I typically try to avoid stacking cs core classes when possible because they tend to demand a lot of time. If you found 3110+2800 difficult combined, this would only be harder. \n\nOption 2 I wouldn\u2019t even consider because 4820 is almost in its entirety building upon 2800, so absolutely don\u2019t take it til you\u2019re done 2800 cause it\u2019s similar concepts but 3x harder.",

If you\u2019re set on taking 4820 (super hard but also absolutely the most relevant class for CS related job interviews and such) definitely take them back to back. I would still suggest reconsidering stacking multiple core cs classes in the same semester though.",

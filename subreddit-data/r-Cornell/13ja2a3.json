    "postText": "I recently made a significant decision regarding my academic path and would love to hear your thoughts and advice. Originally accepted into the Cornell Precollege Architecture Program, I had to transfer due to financial constraints. I ultimately chose to study Environmental Psychology, believing it will provide valuable insights for planning functional spaces.\n\nDo you think I made the right decision? Any input or suggestions on how this change could benefit my future architectural aspirations would be greatly appreciated. \n\n(high school junior; class of 2029)",

It\u2019s quite literally a class about the environment and psychology; how the environment (manmade and natural) impacts the way we behave. for understanding spatial planning I imagine understanding that would be useful. Interesting class for sure!",

            "comment": "I will say that unless you have an actual issue other than you dont want to live there, its very unlikely that you will find a switch. Im not gonna say its the best facility out there, but there is a sense of pride and camaraderie between the residents because of how shitty it is. Plus it has one of the best in-residence libraries on campus, including access to most textbooks if you just ask. Plus, it is exactly dead center on north campus, so all the other dorms and dining halls are an easy walk. Its one of the few dorms ive seen as well where people actually use the common room on each floor, and not just the same five people every time. Its not just a \u201cparty\u201d dorm, its genuinely social. Also there is ac in the common rooms and the first floor formal lounge and library (ithaca gets pretty cool at night even in the summer, so its not unbearable as long as you get some air flow going). Also the faculty in residence has a really cute dog thats always around for pets",

Trust me, going to morrison gym, morrison dining hall and rpcc is like free 1 min walk. Especially morrison dining hall, breakfast is gonna be SO EASY for you. Heading to central is still pretty close comparing to other dorms.\n\nStudying might be difficult due to party dorm and dorm quality, but I tend to study at central or psb. Psb is nice because when you leave, you can go through baker building and when you exit, it's literally the north campus bridge.\n\nSource: I lived at Donlon 22-23.",

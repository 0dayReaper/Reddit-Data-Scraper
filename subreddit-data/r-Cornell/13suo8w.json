    "postText": "Does 2940 still use \"*Linear Algebra and its Applications* by Lay, Lay, and McDonald\"? Also, would anybody be able to provide the syllabus with HW assignments? Obviously they may change semester to semester, but I'm looking to get a handle on the concepts over the summer. Thanks!",

And there are some faculty/staff members and alumni (yours truly).\n\nMost of the students here usually resent parents running interference for their kids. So while I applaud your good intention, you may not get the positive response you expect.",

I hope he continues that tone that there is nothing wrong with being of service and flying solo has its place but a post on a platform is not the biggest atrocity in the world.  Shameful judgment for no reason.",

    "postText": "I got a postcard in the mail today that is obviously a scam, but it claims to be from a Sandy Gregorich who works at Cornell. A Google search reveals that such a person does exist but there's no contact info in their employee bio. I feel like I should let this person know that their identity is being used fraudulently, or if it was them I can pass on my LL's contact info so he can get scammed instead \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

That and the cash offer with no realtor involved sounds super sketchy",

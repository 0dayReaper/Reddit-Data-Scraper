    "postText": "My mom and brothers are out of town for my brothers baseball tournament currently so I'm home alone for the next day or so. Facing a lack of stark lack of desirable food at the homestead, I ordered takeout from a local sports bar kinda place which rebranded with a new name and menu sometime during this past semester while I was away. Got a burger with queso, jalapeno, banana peppers, lettuce, and some kind of chili sauce (took off the pickles and tomato). Funnily enough onions were not a provided topping.   \n\n\nI was VERY pleasantly surprised.  \n\n\nKeep in mind I live in a very tiny town (population \\~1500 according to most recent census) so the like 3 other local establishments are generally pretty iffy but this was genuinely a high quality burger. Perfect medium rare thick angus beef patty, toppings were fresh and flavorful, sauces were great and importantly there wasn't too much and it didn't drown out the flavor of any of the other ingredients. It all worked together beautifully. Admittedly the bun was obviously quite cheap but it still did its job and that's a small concession all things considered. It also came with some rather delicious thick cut kinda like half curly fry half potato wedges which were also top notch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrice wise at like $8-9 this is a steal and a half. Rating just the meal itself this is like an 8/10 but in the context of the region and the limited availability of alternative dining choices this is closer to a 9-9.5.   \n\n\nI look forward to patronizing this business again in the near future !",

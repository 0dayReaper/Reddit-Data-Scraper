Assuming you're premed, I'd suggest taking it in the fall if you want to stay roughly on track to get through all the intro requirements at a decent pace. Crane will also likely be a better professor than Lee (at least, in the sense that he's not going to scream at you for mistakes), so there's that. I don't think the class content, prelims and all are more difficult one semester or the other because the curve tends to even things out for the most part, but vastly more people take it in the Fall for reasons other commenters have listed below, which is always better.",

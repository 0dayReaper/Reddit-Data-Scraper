            "comment": "Not to be too snarky, but it\u2019s called a job and lots of people on campus have one, and you get one by looking at the Cornell job listings. You can talk to a PI you like about working for them, but for a non-student paid position they do actually need to post the position formally. So the process is a little different than working in a lab for credit.\n\nIn my job, I\u2019ve worked with a lot of people who get lab tech positions right out of undergrad, either as a gap year position or just as a regular job, and that is how a lot of Cornell scientific staff started their career here. Even if you are doing some independent research in there, it\u2019s a different feeling, and I think it\u2019s a good experience to have if you are going into science, no matter your long-term goals.",

            "comment": "for the most part, labs are pretty autonomous... if they want you as a lab tech they simply push the paperwork. If you want to go as a volunteer for no cash (some people ahve the means to do that) and your sole focus is research work/LOR stuffs, that can be arranged as well. Pretty much shoot your shot to the PI and GL.",

Looking at job listings might be good but also if you see a PI you\u2019re interested in recently got a big grant you could have some luck emailing them directly.",

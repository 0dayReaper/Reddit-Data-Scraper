No one takes notes because slides and note-like documents r posted on canvas or by students on Ed (posting forum)\n\nAlso it\u2019s really easily to submit assignments by taking pictures of a paper. I use Microsoft lens and it\u2019s amazingly easily to submit with that to canvas",

Though you have the option to handwrite it and then click pics. In my experience having a tablet is hella convenient if you can afford it, but it's not a necessity.",

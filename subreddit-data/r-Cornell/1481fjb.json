    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m currently a rising sophomore at Colgate and I\u2019m considering transferring to Cornell. I\u2019m currently on pre-med/pre-health track and worried about a potentially competitive atmosphere, especially among pre-meds. \n\nAlso wondering if anyone else from Colgate who transferred has any thoughts? Was it easy to transfer credits? And did you feel it was difficult to get accepted? \n\nI\u2019m mainly scared that I\u2019ll go through the whole process to not get accepted or I\u2019ll transfer and end up not liking it more than Colgate. \n\nThank you for any help you can give!",

I got really lucky with my transfer credits and basically everything transferred over. I think for the most part, the general premed class will have no issues transferring, you might lose a class here or there, but that's pretty common with a lot of transfers\n\n I think the premed culture here can be as toxic as you want it to be. I got lucky and found people who were either not premed or aren't as tryhard about it, so I avoided a lot of the toxic competition. But if you go looking for the toxic peeps you'll find them.",

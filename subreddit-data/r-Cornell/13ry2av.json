Like Elmwood Ave.    DM me and I can tell you my landlord's name from the Paleolithic Era or my old address.    \n\nThe more upper c-town you go, the quieter and fewer drunken flash-mobs, on a logarithmic scale.  \n\nConsider craiglist ads to be scams by default, unless your data-mining indicates that Ithaca is the one place for which craigslist is not rife with rental robo-scams.",

Message me if you want more details!  Also to answer you question the off campus living group at cornell has a page that is very helpful for finding housing.  It is a mix of students/ postdocs who are looking for roommates and landlords posting full units.  Unless you have a car I would either stay close to campus or be near a good bus route",

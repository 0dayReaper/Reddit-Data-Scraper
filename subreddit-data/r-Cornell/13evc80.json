    "postText": "Hi, I'm an admitted student at Cornell Engineering and I've been very overwhelmed by CUOnTheHill and just the overall housing process. As I don't really use social media (besides Reddit, the only platform I have an account on is Instagram, and I haven't been active since 2017), I felt very intimidated by everyone's posts and profiles. While I want to have a roommate, I don't know anyone else who is going to Cornell, and am kind of nervous about being assigned a random person.  However, I haven't yet been able to work up the courage to message anyone on CUOTH, so I feel like I'm kind of stuck with just playing the random roommate lottery... Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? \n\nThanks,\n\nA CS Introvert",

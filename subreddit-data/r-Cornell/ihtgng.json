There was a warning out to not drive, and the buses cut service, but the university was open. My 8am calculus class did not cancel and the TA still held class for the 2 people that showed up. It was a fun walk from JAM to Mallott.",

They canceled a false warning and then reissued it when the storms actually moved through. It was really bad communication on Cornell University's part. What they actually should have done was sent out an email when the tornado watch was issued which said something like, \"A tornado watch is in effect until 7pm. This means conditions are favorable for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Stay alert for changing weather conditions. We will send you another alert via CornellALERT if a severe storm is in the area.\"",

New posts will not show up for now, but you can still comment\n\nEdit 3: If you see people giving advice such as leaving where they are sheltered, please report it, we dont want people to get hurt for following bad advice. Everyone please stay safe and locked down unless directed to do otherwise by authorities.\n\nEdit 4: Cornell confirmed that there is a bomb threat. We still dont know if there is anything else, so please stay safe and locked down.\n\nEdit 5: We took the subreddit out of restricted mode. Still keep all stuff related to this in this thread, but you can post again. ",

One of the articles from local news in Ohio (from I think a threat on Thursday) mentioned that \"investigators had determined\" those threats came from the same individual.  \n  \nFWIW I've been through a few of these in my day, a couple back in HS, one in college, obviously everyone takes it seriously but you know, although tbh in HS none of us did, we played hacky sack outside until the all clear, but really different crowd than your typical Cornell student I suppose. Sorry I'm getting off topic. But you know, try to relax a little and take it in stride",

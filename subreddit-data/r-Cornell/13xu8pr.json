            "comment": "Lots of people LOVE the plant science building.  It is very beautiful in some spots and charming in others.  Of course some of the bathrooms are funky as has been posted on reddit with many other old buildings here, but the Plant Sci building is over all beautiful and it has soul...unlike the plastic renovations that get done at Cornell.\n\nSome people love old houses and some people love McMansions...many students who like nature, trees, plants...also appreciate the charm of the plant sci building.   Cornell talks big about being environmentally sound and using reusable dishs etc, then they pullout lovely oak woodwork and replace it with cheesy looking, plastic, quasi modern corporate stuff.  Design with no soul.",

The wall molding provides great accents and I love the green color. None of the new designs have any personality like psb does. There\u2019s ugly old lecture halls like Uris hall basement and there\u2019s musty old lecture halls like in baker, but the one in psb aged like fine wine. I heard they\u2019re renovating the building sometime soon and I really hope they update the bathrooms and make the halls more vibrant but leave the rest alone",

Its a boring and sterile look.  If you want an idea of what's to come step into the CALS Zone attached to Mann.  Its where you used to pick up books, off hours.\n\nI was told the lecture hall is going, by a professor, so not 100% sure, but I think they were correct.\n\nI was walking a very prominent visiting scientist through the basement floor of the Plant Science bldg. recently, the level that you enter from Minn's garden on Tower Rd. and they stopped in the main hallway and said \"isn't this wonderful, it's so nice...look at this...\"  they were genuinely taken aback by the charm of it. I agreed and said it makes you think about all the people who've walked through these halls before.  I didn't have the heart to tell them it'll all be gone in a year or two.\n\nA good part of why people flock to Paris is because Parisians have cherished their architecture.  Its what make it such an attraction.",

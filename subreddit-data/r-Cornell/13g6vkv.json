    "postText": "I was in the library studying and saw someone eat a full size candy bar, like just as a snack. Is this a normal thing for adults to do? Like I\u2019m really not trying to shame this person, but I am so perplexed like I just unconsciously thought that adults weren\u2019t allowed to eat candy unless it was a special occasion or if they skipped a meal to compensate for it. Like how can this person eat a full size candy bar with no shame?\n\nInitially when I saw it I was shocked, then I realized that it was such a stupid idea in my head that \u201cadults can\u2019t eat candy\u201d but then doing research it looks like doctors generally recommend adults not eating candy (since our diets often go over the recommended amount of sugar). So like I am torn, is it unhealthy to eat a full candy bar or is it unhealthy to be shocked by someone enjoying a snack?",

But something it would do everyone well to remember is that we don't just need to feed our bodies and minds, but also our souls. And sometimes that means giving yourself permission to have the damn candy bar and not feel guilty about it just because it will make you happy\n\nAlso please take care of yourself. Several of the comments you made are common themes expressed by people with eating disorders. That's just something to be aware of and please reach out to someone if you feel concerned - I know Cornell Health gets a lot of flack on here but there are people there who truly care and want to help, and feel free to reach out to me if you want tips on how to connect with the right people",

You can eat whatever the fuck you feel like, whenever the fuck you feel like it?\n\nTons of adults eat candy all day long. Tons of adults have a KING-size candy bar after every meal. I have friends who smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day, and I'd prefer if they ate 5 candy bars a day (and sometimes they do). I've known people who drank 2.5 full bottles of vodka a day for years, and everyone would have preferred if they ate 2.5 full-size (*gasp*) candy bars a day. So, yeah, eat up johnny.",

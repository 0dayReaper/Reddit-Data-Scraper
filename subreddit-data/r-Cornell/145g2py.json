    "postText": "Considering majoring in CS (A&amp;S), but unsure of which lin alg class to take.\n\nI know they give the option between the 1110-1120-2210 arts sequence and the 1910-1920-2940 eng sequence, but I was curious if you're allowed to combine the two for the purposes of fulfilling the math requirement, e.g. 1120 -&gt; 2940.\n\nI took 1120 and did well, but I've heard the engineering maths are more application-based while the math dept. classes are more theoretical, which is why I'd prefer taking 2940 given the option.\n\nIs this at all advisable/allowed? I did see 1920 listed as a prereq for 2940, so I assume some multivariable calc would be necessary, which I'm willing to self-study. Or should I just suck it up and take 2210?",

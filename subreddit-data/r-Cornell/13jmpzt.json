My grades aren\u2019t so hot and they\u2019re convinced no one will hire me with my GPA and I need to go elsewhere. I\u2019m trying to convince them that the connections and opportunities I\u2019ll have here are more important than my GPA. I\u2019m frustrated because this will be my senior year and I just want to graduate. I need to convince them because they\u2019ve withheld financial support for college unless I transfer (or convince them to let me return). Desperate for advice",

Otherwise you just leave the GPA off the resume and talk about what you learned. Also if you go somewhere else, you are likely to get similar grades and will just have a low GPA from another school.",

Mental contamination is letting one factor bleed into other factors of an evaluation and thus make an unfair assessment of the situation (kudos to Prof Fath for this). There\u2019s so much to learn and attain exclusively from Cornell that it outweighs the GPA factor. Say your grades are absolutely bad and no recoverable, literally the connections here alone are enough to outweigh that. Of course there\u2019s a bazillion other things too, but my point is that don\u2019t let one factor that seems significant influence all other factors used to weigh the decision. \n\nImo, when it comes to Reddit posts, I\u2019m usually unsure about offering advice because, at the end of the day, it\u2019s up to you to decide and choose what\u2019s best for you. But based off what I\u2019m hearing, the decision you\u2019d be making by leaving solely because of that wouldn\u2019t be the best. Just as someone else mentioned here, leaving doesn\u2019t guarantee a good GPA somewhere else",

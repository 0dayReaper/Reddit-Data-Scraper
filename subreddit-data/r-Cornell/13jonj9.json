Now I give extensive feedback and long paragraphs to my friends or others asking for my opinion even if I don\u2019t care too much. \n\nMight delete this it doesn\u2019t seem like ppl would care/relate lol",

I'm not saying it was reddit because idk if this started before or after I started using it but I'm definitely crediting the internet in some manner",

I honestly think it\u2019s underrated a lot by people but hey, it helps maintain the quality of the conversations we can have here to an extent. Now I\u2019m not responding to people in paragraphs per se, but the time I spend on here has given me a unique insight into a wide variety of perspectives and opinions, so I think a bit more about my own opinions now.",

    "postText": "Hi ! I'm an incoming exchange student from Australia who's looking to do some psychology units while at Cornell. I noticed that a lot of the 3000 level and 4000 level units are already marked as closed- does this mean that the unit filled up already in pre-enrollment? Is there any chance of getting into these classes during the normal open enrollment period?",

            "comment": "You might also try reaching out to the professors directly.  If you look on the course Roster page they usually will the profs name.  I their email is not there ( if forget, but I think not) then you can go tot the selection tab on the right side and type in the profs name it will bring up their net id, which is their email with u/Cornell.edu added to the end.\n\nYou have special circumstances for not having enrolled during pre-enrollment.  Some professors have a few seats open for special circumstances.  You can just reach out and say your coming for the semester as an exchange student and would like to take their class but it is full.  Do they have any seats avial or a wait-list?  Make sure you really want the class before doing that.  You might want to check the prof out on \"Rate my Professor\" website. it can give you an idea.  there are some great profs here and there are some that don't know how to teach.  It's always good to scope out as much as you can.",

Yes, it does mean that the classes have already been filled up during pre-enroll earlier this month, but there will be an add/drop period a few days before the first day of classes start in August and people usually drop classes during that time or switch things up and spots tend to open up. I\u2019d suggest just being on the lookout for the specific classes that you plan on taking and see if a spot opens up! Good luck!",

I haven\u2019t personally taken any psychology classes, but looking through the Fall 2023 roster, I\u2019ve heard great things about PSYCH 1101, PSYCH 2580, PSYCH 2750, and PSYCH 3135, so I\u2019d recommend checking those ones out and see if you\u2019re interested! \n\nAnd, as for any electives, I\u2019m currently an Anthropology major and I\u2019d definitely recommend some of the introductory classes in the department. It\u2019s a very broad major and the courses reflect that, it caters to what your interests may be and it\u2019s just really interesting. I\u2019d also recommend checking out other departments like History, English/Comparative Literature, Classics, Philosophy, Human Development, and more, for some classes that are fascinating and may also be tied to psychology. \n\nI hope this helped you a bit!! Good luck, and feel free to message me if you have any more questions now and in the near future :)",

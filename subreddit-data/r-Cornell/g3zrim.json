    "postText": "Y'all peeps I've dug myself into a pretty big hole here. My depression spiraled after coming home and well, I have barely looked at school in the past 2 weeks. At least at school, I had my friends to motivate me, but here, well, there's no one. I can't even go to therapy anymore because I know my parents will overhear and LOL I don't even want to know what will happen. As shitty as Cornell Health was at least it was something. \n\nI'm probably like 10 lectures behind in everything and I'm not sure if I'm gonna pass all my classes. For the past three days I've tried to tell myself to do work, but I didn't want to confront everything I had to do. It was scary, really fucking scary. I don't like remembering that this time I've failed, and now I have to fight back and solve it. \n\nBut guys, I've done it. I at least wrote down everything I needed to get done. All 243 items. For the first time in a month, I have made a calendar. For the first time in a month, I've watched a lecture and I even took notes. \n\nFor a girl who used to get straight As in high school and was used to always doing well, I can't believe I'm proud of myself for this, but guys I'm really fucking proud of myself. This is one of the hardest things I've ever done and I'm fucking amazing.",

I just feel myself getting less and less motivated each day, and I\u2019m just too scared to confront what I have to do. But if I see someone else feeling the same way, and I can cheer them on, that gives me no reason to keep wasting time. Thank you so much for sharing this, OP. You\u2019re doing an amazing job, and you have so many people rooting for you!",

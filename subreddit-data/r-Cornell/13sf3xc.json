I entered as premed but now I\u2019m not sure what I want to do. \n\nWhat are some other options you guys know of that bio majors could get into? I know for a fact I don\u2019t want to do research, teaching, or get a PhD, but open to getting a masters. \n\nI know there\u2019s things in biotech, healthcare consulting, or other options like PA school. Any advice would be helpful, thanks!",

It\u2019s not for the faint of heart, but if you have a bio undergrad it won\u2019t be over your head. \n\nThat area of study is hot right now. He turned down a job at a research hospital that paid far more than he could have imagined as an undergraduate, but which is not even close to being competitive for his degree. He\u2019s not even tempted to pursue a PhD because he\u2019ll make as much without a doctorate. I don\u2019t know about other areas of biology, but bioinformatics is one place where there is a lot of demand and the pay is generous.",

The problem is that most Bio major success stories involve placing into research programs, whether in academia or in industry, or involve leveraging the degree in combination with graduate studies in something like Pharmaceuticals.\n\nIf you want some idea of where Biology BSc\u2019s end up, there\u2019s a thread on the regular in places like r/biology [such as this](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/rwcoxx/those_with_a_bachelor_degree_in_biology_please/) where people discuss the jobs far outside Biology research/Medicine that they get, usually by leveraging the fact that they have a degree at all. Have heard of people working at national parks, breweries, and doing various government jobs.",

It won\u2019t qualify you for SWE jobs or anything drastic, especially against students in quantitative fields their whole undergrad with internships, but it may very likely help to set you apart in applicant pools where even the most basic demonstrations of quantitative and computer literacy are seen as a plus. Even if your actual undergraduate education wasn\u2019t that quantitative, having those keywords on your resume could help you score interviews and it would just be up to you to prove yourself then.",

There\u2019s a lot of messed up stuff in academia that you don\u2019t really get exposed to from just being outside of it. You don\u2019t go into it expecting stable employment, good pay, good work-life balance, control over where you live, and a healthy working environment. I had heard all the horror stories but still naively thought that I could handle it all anyways, but then burned out after working under an abusive lab PI (not at Cornell, though we have our own such PIs) and with several very stressed postdocs, and was negatively affected by the gloomy and toxic environments I was in. I suggest you get deeply involved in a lab on your own time as an undergrad and that you talk to researchers and do your research on what the field is like. It\u2019s brutally competitive and a lot end up turning to industry for understandable reasons.",

It equals out to about as long as becoming a doctor and likely longer than dentistry before you can enter some semblance of stability, though the benefit to academia is that PhDs are usually funded (not very well paying though) rather than a source of additional debt.\n\nThere can be research opportunities in industry, and these attract some bright minds and offer better pay and living conditions. AFAIK this depends a lot on the type of research you\u2019re willing to do however, and will still involve you getting a PhD at the least.",

My friend did this in Biology and got a great lab job at a biotech firm.

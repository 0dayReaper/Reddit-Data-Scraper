    "postText": "Hello! I am an incoming freshman with the current goal of majoring in mechanical engineering. That being said, I have never used CAD in my life, but would love to start now. I was wondering if any engineer students had any recommendations on what free program I should use. My dad just got a 3D printer and he said I could use it so im hoping to try to make some little projects to help learn :)\n\nThank you so much if you have any!!",

I learned Inventor in a high school class but I haven\u2019t had to 3D print before so idk which of their softwares would be optimized for that, so a little research would be helpful",

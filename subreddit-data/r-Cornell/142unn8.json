    "postText": "I'm at 67 credits right now (going into third-year), and am taking a summer course. I did not do as well as I wanted on the first prelim and I just checked and even if I got A's on the next two assessments I will probably end up with a B+ in the class. It's a 3 credit course, and I am only barely on the dean's list. I'm wondering if there's a decent chance that a B + in this 3 credit class will put my overall GPA below a 3.5? Tomorrow's the last day to drop without a W. I just know that since it\u2019s only 3 credits it won\u2019t have too much of a sway on my grade. But I kinda just want to keep getting A\u2019s",

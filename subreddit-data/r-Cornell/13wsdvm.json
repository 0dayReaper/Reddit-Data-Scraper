Then during the first week of fall semester so many freshmen are begging (or worse paying up on Amazon)  for iclcikers. There should be a more efficient way to match the buyers and sellers. Someone should run an iclicker exchange for Cornell students.  \n\nBetter still, professors should stop demanding students to buy physical iclicker.  It is such an outdated technology.",

The iclicker+ does not have this screen, and instead has lights that flash to indicate whether it is connected and if a response has been submitted. They are both compatible with the iclicker system; it\u2019s just their designs that are different. I have a friend who had a really old iclicker that works as well. \n\nIf you are enrolled in a class that requires an iclicker, an iclicker+ is now provided to students through the Cornell store if you opt into CAMP. CAMP is a program offered through the Cornell store that provides (almost all) necessary academic materials (textbooks, ebooks, workbooks, and iclicker) for your classes at a single price ($250 a semester, I believe). Everyone is automatically enrolled, but a lot of students opt out at the beginning of the year (there is an opt out period). A lot of students opt out of this program if they find that it is cheaper to buy or rent their academic materials on their own. \n\nI\u2019m a rising senior, and only one of my classes these past three years required me to use one. It really depends on the professors you get. I know plenty of people who have gotten through classes without ever having to use one! \n\nHope this helps",

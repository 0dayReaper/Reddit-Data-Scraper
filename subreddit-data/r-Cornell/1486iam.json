            "comment": "elevator on the appel side consistently has problems so rip you if youre on the top floor on that side (i was). novicks is really nice but it tends to fill up fast during study periods so the ability to study in rbgs kitchen and go get study snacks is very nice. one room in each suite has a thermostat, but it honestly doesnt do much, the rooms will stay around the same temperature regardless of what you put it at, but its a decent temperature. the window screens suck and Will tear at the corners if you put any weight on them so just be gentle. the bathrooms are all technically public so if youre the closest bathroom to a lounge, you will have a Lot of other people using it. take advantage of the study rooms downstairs! you can practice presentations with your group on the flatscreens or just study more privately. theres a printer downstairs!! (very nice) idk what else to say but i lived there this past year so if u have specific questions, dm me",

    "postText": "hi, just a few questions to anyone who has taken biomg 2800 over the summer! i heard the class was really bad (i never really found out why though \u2013 just to avoid) during the normal school year, so i was thinking of getting this course out of the way earlier\n\n1. how is prof. ross macintyre? the class seems asynchronous, so i'm not sure if how much he will directly play a role in the learning experience. the RMP reviews look pretty bad, but has anyone had him before for this summer course? \n2. grading: how is the grading? normal curve? significant downwards curve? this class isn't required for my major but it's something i'm interested in, so i don't want this class to tank my GPA. the medians look pretty :( on the spreadsheet compared to other classes (B), so i'm wondering if it's worth taking it at all\n3. what's the asynchronous learning style like? online recorded lectures? online prelims/finals? the description on the website is pretty unclear. \n\nthanks!",

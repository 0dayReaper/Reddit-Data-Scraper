CS1110 was held in Bailey Hall, which is not right next to Gates or Duffield, the home base of CIS.\n\nA different major does not change the answer to the same question.",

For example for engineering majors your (major) classes are more likely to be on Eng Quad, whereas for plant sciences or something your major courses will probably mostly be around Ag Quad.\n\nThe vast majority of upper level math classes are in Malott as well",

CS 2000 and 3000 level classes tend to be in large lecture halls like Uris, Statler and Bailey. And even popular classes like CS 4780 are in Bailey. And both North Campus and West Campus dorms are almost the same distance from these large lecture halls.\n2. Fundamentally, OP is asking which dorm will be closest to his major.  Yes, I know upper level math classes are in Malott.  But what difference does that make regarding his choice of dorm?  It is .6 mile from Morrison to Malott.  It is .5 mile from Rose House to Malott. So your information is irrelevant.\n3. As a sophomore, his classrooms will be all over the place. So his major is not a deciding criterion.\n4. If he is CS major senior, my advice would be different.  I would say he should seriously consider Sheldon or Cas because they are closer to Engineering Quad.",

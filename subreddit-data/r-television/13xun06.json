    "postText": "If you watched Discovery Channel in the mid to late 2000s, you likely came across this show. The show was about two former burglars who went mostly around the tri-state area and picked out homes that they felt were vulnerable to break ins. They would then show the home owners how easy it is for a burglar to break in and from there show them how to prevent them.\n\nWell, the coolest part about the show were the break-ins. It almost seemed less like the show was teaching the audience how to protect their home and more on how to become a professional burglar! It was wild! Not gonna lie, I always rooted for the burglar to get as much as he can and escape before getting caught! They did everything from rob several homes to rob a skate shop rob a home with a Birthday party going on downstairs and even rob a police station! It was awesome!\n\nThe show was abruptly cancelled by Discovery around circa 2007. Here's where it gets kind of strange. The show was quickly cancelled and by 2008 all traces of it were pulled from the air.\n\nEven weirder, Discovery has always been really strict on clips of the show being uploaded to YouTube and other websites, that they basically went as far to remove all trace of it from the internet. Until very recently as it's now on Discovery+. \n\nI remember back in the late 2000s and early 2010s, me and friends would joke that's because Discovery knew this show was teaching people to become burglars. I wanted to bring it up because I rarely see it mentioned anywhere. Up until recently, it was almost lost media!",

So he just saunters into the house, finds a set of car keys, opens the garage, loads up the back of an SUV with everything valuable, and then drives off?\n\nI liked when he had to at least work at the thievery. Like the one with the house boat, where he had to steal someone else's outboard motorboat, pilot it over to the houseboat, then clamber up to a third story window to slide in.\n\nMan, that *was* a fun show. \n\nI think we need a video game studio to do a GTA style game that only cares about breaking into houses and robbing them.",

That's why one of my favorite episodes is the one with the kids birthday party and he's upstairs and no one notices.

Then for Jon it says he was a private eye and has done bit part acting since the 90s. \n\nI wonder if they got arrested as teenagers and turned it around since. Or they had behind the scenes consultants and they had Matt and Jon do all of the on screen work.\n\nBut Jon looks like he knows what he is doing when he robs the places. It's wild.",

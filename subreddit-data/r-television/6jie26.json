I did nuclear propulsion in the Navy so hearing anything nuclear piques my interest.  They mentioned how one of the biggest Tokamaks (type of fusion reactor) in the country is in San Diego (where I lived at the time), and I was intrigued, so I looked up the company.  Then for fun checked job postings and they had one that fit my skillset (IT support) so I figured I'd apply, since at the time I was just a contractor, and this was a FTE position.  Ended up getting the job, and I mentioned the Modern Marvels episode in my interview, the manager thought it was funny that that was how I found the company and job posting.",

I saw the same documentaries over and over, memorizing every scene, every fact. I know next to nothing about opera, classical music, poetry, and sports, but, whenever Jeopardy's on, I sweep the fuck out of any category that has to do with animals.\n\nIt's crazy to think about now. All those legit educational networks have morphed into reality show trash. Yeah, kids can learn a ton by spiraling down a YouTube k-hole, but I think the massive popularity of the Planet Earth series proves that there's still something special about the format.\n\nI know the change in programming was in response to viewer demand; people would rather see naked, dirty men and women abandoned on some island and drinking their own piss. But it sucks to have watched as these channels that once had a sorta noble mission just... turn to complete shit.",

So that is what more and more channels started making. TLC used to be the learning channel, showing educational, science shows, not it is all reality shows. MTV used to show music, now it is almost all reality shows. Not only do people want to watch them, they want to be on them to make themselves famous. The only way to turn this around is to stop watching reality shows which isn't going to happen. I am not saying they don't have a place for enjoyment, but we have forced these channels to go this way to stay afloat. If not, half the cable channels would probably be off air. ",

A channel (or game company, or author, or whatever) makes an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, and in doing so their previously loyal viewership collapses.  After a certain point its too late to turn back, they can't switch back to the old style of shows they used to do because most of the people who used to love watching stuff like that have probably either switched to a new channel or they've cut the cord.",

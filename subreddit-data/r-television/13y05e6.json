    "postText": "As someone that binge watches a lot of TV, an annoying new \"feature\" Amazon's been forcing onto users, is that the ads are no longer skippable with the click of a button at the beginning of each episode like they used to. Instead, one must either fast forward manually and guess when the episode starts or click the skip intro button which now skips to the middle of the intro instead of the end.   \nThe worst part of this new change is that around a minute or more before an episode ends, the next episode notification pops up and occasionally spoils the next episode before a big reveal (which typically happens at the end of most episodes, especially for thriller shows) and also gets in the way of the actual screen which might hide something important. This isn't a MASSIVE service-ending deal or anything, just something aggravating to myself and several others I've spoken to about. Just wondering what your thoughts are on this latest installment of companies using invasive ads on paying customers.",

One of my friend's wives did not give a shit about video games whatsoever, but she would be in on that. Halo and Grand Theft Auto didn't do that.\n\nI almost feel like Microsoft deserved to get stomped like they did this round because they're so stupid about not coming up with some suitable replacement for it. I can understand not paying for the license / the license expiring, but there's no reason they couldn't have come up with something else suitable to replace it. The most we've gotten - and this was a few years ago now - is Phil Spencer saying they were \"looking into something\" to bring a similar experience back. Yeah, nothing happened.",

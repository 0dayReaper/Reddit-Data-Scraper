They make saying goodbye to each character like blowing out a candle one by one until there's nothing left. An amazing end to an amazing series.",

I'm pretty sure that this was a show what he enjoyed, we talked about it last time that we hung out, but we were both drinking a bit.\n\nDo you have a good idea of how to watch this in completion? Like how to pace it or anything? I know some people binge and some people watch an episode here and there but I want a good flow since I've never really watched it.\n\nThanks for even reading this.",

And of course the finale is 2 hours without ads, about 2 1/2 with ads, so it would be best to watch when you have the time.\n\nEither way, hope you enjoy it.",

The jokes feel less like punchlines from a script and more like scared people clinging to ANY silliness they can in a life and death situation, ANY way they can lighten the horrific conditions they're in.\n\nTheres times that jokes that would have been accompanied by a laugh track just hang in the air and instead of coming off as comic relief, they come off as desperate attempts at lightening the mood from doctors in war time.\n\nWhich isnt to say there isnt laugh out loud moments obviously.",

While I could point out issues with how they handled a few of the main characters, they each brought something special to the show.\n\nAnd I agree, the finale was great.  I like how it gave each character their time to shine, and to say goodbye to each other (and the audience).  My personal favorite story was Charles and the musicians, but I'm biased since he's my favorite character on the show.  But of course Hawkeye's reveal was very profound, and affected how I see the character in rewatch.",

And then the amount of episodes came out, and their length...\n\nIt was one thing after another and the only thing I was hoping for was it would not be *that* bad, and just at least tolerable. I was hyped because it's the end of the show and wanted to see what would happen. And after reading some of the leaks when the first and second episode were the way they were, I knew they were most likely true.\n\nSeeing the stages of grief happening was unfortunate since it was all by people who just love this show and want nothing more than just a serviceable finale at that point. Shame",

That could be neat.\" \n\nThen two episodes later after Felicity has made such a big deal about learning to live with her new disability and how she can overcome anything, Ray shows up and is like \"nah it's okay, heres some random nanobots to fix everything.\" So I guess all that character development and drama over the last 2 episodes was entirely pointless filler that had absolutely no reason to exist other than to push the season along. Cool. Love it when shows waste my time like that. The drama wasnt even good, either. It was the typical \"idk if I love you\" bullshit they had rehashed probably 5 previous times in the course of half the season. \n\nThat's the point where I was like \"nope, this isnt worth my brain cells attention, this is complete drivel.\"",

The person who became the ruler isn't a problem, it makes total sense if you think about it, but how we get there is an absolute joke.

One thing Martin does so well is pay close attention to this stuff. You can't move 10,000 troops without supplies, protection, planning, etc. The entire reason Robb captured Jaime (and the indirect reason he lost his arm) was because they tricked a scout. The reason we had the Red Wedding, one of the wildest moments in television, was because Robb needed one little bridge to move his army south. Those seemingly \"minute\" details led to incredibly important events. The later seasons said \"fuck it. Let's have Euron just appear where we need him. Fuck it, let's not have Lannisters use scouts so we can have an epic dragon ambush.\" Once that nonsense started happening in season 6 I lose interest. Martin does such a good job of making his fantasy feel real, and D&amp;D shit all over it.",

Like you said, even with some of the worst like Dexter and HIMYM, they STILL have some form of replay value with either their earlier seasons, or classic episodes. Game of Thrones\u2019 classic episodes relied on an ambitious and over-arching story where eventually all of these stories had to be concluded or converge in some way.\n\nAnd the thing is, they fucking had a chance to make it work! They could have easily made this a fantastic finish just by simply making season 8 dedicated to the White Walkers, and season 9 dedicated to Cersei vs Dany. The fact that there was a foreseeable way to do this, and we didn\u2019t get that simply because the show-runners said \u201cNo. Fuck that. We\u2019re done.\u201d is what makes this the worst series finale of all time.",

Cersei's fate should have been sealed as soon a she blew up the sept. Season 7/8 should have been Cersei vs Dany with Cersei's rule crumbling around her. The White Walkers/Dany herself (but done better) being the big threat in the finale season or two. Jon destroys the White Walkers and kills Dany ending the Song of Ice and Fire.",

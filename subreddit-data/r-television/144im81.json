It's disheartening to see how many recent attempts have just fallen flat.\n\nReally glad atleast House of the Dragon was able to reclaim some of the early GoT quality. That's been singlehandedly carrying the genre again in my opinion.\n\nAlso keep a look out for 'Shogun' that should be out on FX late this year. Basically a GoT in medieval Japan. Source material is amazing, if they can nail the quality it might be something special! Medieval Japan sounds like a pretty top tier setting!",

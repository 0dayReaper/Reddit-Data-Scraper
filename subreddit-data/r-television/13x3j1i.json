Like I\u2019m in the middle of rewatching Veep right now but I have to search it and remember the last episode I was on before I can watch it. Anyone else? It\u2019s so annoying",

It gives some sort of vague error when I go to play something.\n\nI'm guessing it means I need to resync my provider (as I had to do that every 2 to 3 days under hbo max) but I haven't needed to on my computer.",

Season of Storms was written decades after the other books and has a good amount of flashback/prequel content but it's generally agreed to be the last to read.\n\nGood luck getting your hands on any physical copies though - Amazon and Barnes and Noble are having trouble with stock, especially for the first few. Digital copies should be easy enough to get though",

They continue the story beyond the canon ending of the books, so the games do contain spoilers for some of the book plot - in particular the very beginning of Witcher 1 spoils the ending of the book series (naturally, since it takes place immediately afterwards) and the opening of Witcher 3 spoils a big reveal from the last book.\n\nSo if anything, if you want to read the books /u/Dristone, feel free to jump in and read them now. They won't ruin anything from the games, but the games have the potential to spoil the books if you want to read them with all the surprised intact! Plus, the games are filled to the brim with references and fan service that you'll appreciate more if you read the books first.",

I've been played/betrayed!!\",  I thought \"oh, so these stories are not happening in parallel? Huh. Neat.\"\n\nWhether Yen is 35 or 135 when she meets Geralt is absolutely irrelevant when these characters basically know no age after their respective transformations into mage and witcher. All we need to know is that destiny means for Geralt to meet an as-of-yet-in-his-timeline unborn Ciri and that Yen not going to Nilfgaard might've changed the circumstances of the war and... that's about it, in terms of chronological shenanigans?",

Ciri tells Calanthe something like \"You won the battle at Hochebuz when you were my age\" and then we immediately transition into a scene where Renfri tells Geralt something like \"Queen Calanthe of Cintra just led the charge at the battle of Hochebuz. That could have been me if not for...\"\n\nThen in episode two we clearly see years passing for Yennefer but only days for Ciri and Geralt so that's a pretty good hint the storylines aren't in sync.\n\nEpisode three has Yennefer introduced to the little children versions of the prince and princess of Temeria in the middle of Geralt talking to the fat middle aged version of that king whose sister died over a decade ago.\n\nPretty sure there were many other hints throughout but they were relatively subtle, mostly thanks to having to track the names of characters and places carefully. Personally I think it makes for a really cool and probably intentional effect of Yennefer and Geralt feeling out of time, unchanging while the world around them spins away and evolves.",

Jaskier looks the same - around 25 - in all the episodes and the fact that it is never mentioned in the show that witchers and magic users age way slower than normal population, is very confusing for people who are watching the show and don't know a thing about the lore.. because now they thing that the show just doesn't care about aging their main characters",

Then Calanthe doesnt appear to age between Geralt meeting her and the fall of Cintra.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: People seem to be getting hung up on the fact I said she doesnt appear to age, that isnt even the main point of this post, she looks too old to begin with and then because she doesn't look like she has aged from 32 to 44/45 it adds to the timeline confusion.",

Vesemir is something like 300 years old and looks 70, although in much better shape.\n\nMages stop their aging with the anti-aging mandrake decoction, that completely halts the aging process, although it cannot reverse it, making them potentially immortal. Sorceresses usually start taking the decoction in their mid-twenties, to fully preserve their beauty, male mages in their forties, to have an aura of respectability. The mages that look older than that are so because they were already of that actual age when the mandrake decoction was invented (humans had no knowledge of magic when they entered the world during the conjunction of the spheres, so after they received the basics from elves the current magic has been result of active and ongoing research). This include Gerhart (the oldest living mage), Ortolan (the inventor of the mandrake decoction) and Stregobor. There are no sorceresses that old because the Brotherhood of Mages is (and used to be even more) a mysoginistic organisation (see above) that didn't admit women from the start. Tissaia de Vries is the oldest living sorceress and was among the first batch of women admitted for formal study of magic.",

From an article.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Thanks to the brutal yet potentially unexpected poisoning of the Aryans, Oz can no longer function as it once used to. Though many deaths are on the hands of those left, each section of the prison ends up being evacuated in the season finale's final moments. McManus can be heard saying that the move is \"only temporary,\" maintaining a certainty that they \"will be back someday.\" Viewers are then left to draw their own conclusions as to what happens next, while the episode airs haunting images of cells and recreation rooms left vacant.  \nDespite there not being any clarity, it's a safe bet that Oz becomes a ghost town. It's arguably smart to leave a few loose ends unanswered \u2014 ultimately meaning that the show could be picked up in some form at a later date \u2014 but some viewers consider the closing moments both \"abrupt\" and a \"lazy\" choice.\"",

It feels empty and frankly the story lines are like something that a soap opera would come up with and as you say almost everyone is awful.\n\nBut what an astonishing array of actors that passed through that show. It's amazing.",

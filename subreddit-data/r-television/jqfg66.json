Within these books is the story of your entire life. Before entering the kingdom of heaven, you must bear witness for acts in life, and face judgement.\u201d \n\nSt. Peter takes the first book off of the large stack and opens it. Trebek notices St. Peter squinting as he inspects the first page with a look of confusion. St. Peter raises his head and in a much less commanding voice, says \u201c Suck it, Trebek?\u201d \n\nAs soon as St. Peter mutters these words, the heavens erupt in magnificent laughter of Sean Connery. Connery then appears behind the pearly gates and puts his arm around Trebek and leads him into heaven. Both of them, laughing, disappear into the clouds...\n\nR.I.P. \ud83d\ude22",

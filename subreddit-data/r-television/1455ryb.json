Kaley's delivery in this new show is good, but the humor overall is... not my cup of tea. I don't know, maybe it's good, I really like humor in \"The Woman (...)\" (would love to see more shows like that one) and the chemistry between characters in \"Only Murders (...)\", I feel that \"Based on (...)\" unfortunately lacks on both humor and chemistry, it's not bad, but it's forgettable and feels like literal \"summer replacement\".",

Subject matter is about murder podcast so it has same theme as Only murders in the building. However the tone and style is very much The Boys especially the violence! It is created by one of the guys who wrote the boys. \n\nKaley as the lead do remind us of The Flight attendant.",

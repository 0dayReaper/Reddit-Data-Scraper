    "postText": "Like the potential is there for a good show but it just can't commit to a premise. It wants to criticize the family of being shallow and greedy but also wanting them to be redeemable or good at heart but misguided. It introduces antaognists to make the family seem not as bad.\n\nI just want these shows to lay into criticizing the ultra wealthy. It's what I love with Arrested Development and Succession. Succession kept the focus that the Roys were just greedy assholes destined for a sisyphistic cycle of backstabbing and power grabbing and none of them will be happy. Barry, while not about the ultra rich, still had consistent satire and made sure Barry was never good. \n\nRighteous Gemstones has the opportunity to attack the televangelists that deserve to be attacked for exploiting religion for their financial gain but the series doesn't. It even has this frustrating apolitical lens avoiding having the Gemstones express the beliefs we have seen from that community. Pat Robertson just passed away, read up on his views. We get moments that are close like Jesse saying he doesn't care if his son was bisexual or Kelvin's tiring gay/not gay characterization that doesn't have the cleverness of say Tobias in AD. But the series would be better if it made them the homophobes they should be and ridiculing them and their ideas. But it doesn't. I just want good satire.",

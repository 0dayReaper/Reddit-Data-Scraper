The second act would be his presidency, and his descent to madness and power, culminating into his impeachment.\n\nFeaturing such songs as:\n\n* \u201cEscalator to Hell\u201d\n\n* \u201cGrab them. (By the Pussy)\u201d\n\n* \u201cLocker Room Song\u201d\n\nMedley into: \u201cLock\u2019er Up!\u201d\n\n* \u201cFake News!\u201d\n\n* \u201cFake News!

Thank you.\n\nAdditional songs:\n\n* \u201cA Very Stable Genius\u201d (suggested below)\n\n* \u201cThe Hoochy Coochy Scaramucci\u201d\n\nEdit 2: Alright, ya\u2019ll. I\u2019ll probably definitely going to write it. I have to do a lot of research first, so who knows when I\u2019ll start writing. I have some books I want to read, \u201cFire and Fury\u201d being a major one. If anyone has any good sources for broad overviews on him, and the people involved in his campaign, I\u2019ll try to get to them.\n\nI want to maybe start writing by the end of the year.",

The Senate has 100 members and is barely Republican controlled. Trump is a Republican, and many members of the Senate are very vocal in their unwavering support of Trump (in particular, Republicans Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell).\n\nRegarding whether Trump actually asked for quid pro quo, the President's acting Chief of Staff [Mick Mulvaney said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKRjDdIGWU4)\n\n&gt; \"We do that all the time, [...] get over it.\"\n\nTwo other items worth mentioning: this all came to our attention because a US Dept of Intelligence employee filed a whistleblower complaint about Trump's \"alarming\" behavior, in which the whistleblower revealed that the memo/transcript had been given unusual treatment and moved to a super-ultra-top-secret server, which is not appropriate for a call like this.",

However, there is virtually zero chance he'll be removed from office. 20 (I believe this is the number) Republicans will have to vote in favor of removal, and that's just not going to happen. If 20 haven't turned on him by now, they're not going to. Too much to lose by crossing party lines, up to and including re-election. Side note: this is another reason it's important to support Congressional term limits - If you only get one term, you don't have to worry about re-election! (Edit: Take this last statement with a grain of salt, I might actually be very wrong about this, we'll see)\n\nEdit: Ok I've learned a LOT since I said this. Entirely new perspectives.",

A network like CBS, ABC, NBC that would be free to watch assuming you can get proper antenna reception.\n\nSounds like PBS is going to air the proceedings.  That's over-the-air but a major network like one of the three I mentioned above would probably get a ton more viewership than PBS (or CSPAN for that matter).",

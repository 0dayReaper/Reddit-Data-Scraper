    "postText": "I feel like each episode is 45 minutes full of nothing and advertisements for their products. I miss the old KUWTK where they weren\u2019t so boring, it felt more real. It\u2019s a reality tv show with nothing going on, just dragged on boring scenes. I also feel like Scott being back in season 3 is so forced because I feel as if they don\u2019t even talk to Scott as much outside of the show and he was only brought on because of everyone asking for him. Idk, what do you think?",

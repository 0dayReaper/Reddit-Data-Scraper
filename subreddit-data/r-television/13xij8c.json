Lyanna gave birth to Jon, naming him Aegon, and died in the birthing bed after the Battle at the Trident where Rhaegar died.  Meaning Jon had a valid claim to the Iron Throne.  Which is why Ned Stark lied about Wyla to Robert Baratheon and no one else.  It\u2019s why Ned didn\u2019t want to tell Jon about his mother, or real father, until after he took the Oath of the Night\u2019s Watch.  He would have forsworn his claim and would possibly be safe from Robert as a rival.  (And as far as we know for the show, Aerys didn\u2019t disinherit Rhaegar for Viserys in the show.)  Jon is a legitimate heir to the Iron Throne.  In the show.  !&lt;",

With that in mind I can handle some poor communication, going back to the main crux of the show being how dysfunctional the protagonists are, but it definitely pushed into the annoying zone at times in all seasons - season 2 in particular felt like I was person watching a bunch of cats behind glass, hoping they would all go where I wanted them to at the same time but also knowing that it would take a literal miracle for them to muster the coordination to do so. And as a viewer, whether that's thematically appropriate or not, I can't help feeling super frustrated.",

Any idea can work - stephen king made a gripping tragedy based around a living car that kills people. Ideas mean nothing, the execution is the part that actually matters. \n\nYou can like what you want, but to pretend its some unavoidable element that must be included is just wrong. They could be more inventive and make the drama less forced.\n\n(edit) the defense for this shows bad writing is really grinding my gears. Guys, you can like something and still acknowldge its flaws. Dragon Ball Z fans dont even try to defend the levels of stupid in that show. They all recognize how mind bendingly stupid allowing an enemy to transform is, they get dunked on all the time for this kind of lazy bullshit. They make fun of the inconsistent shit (\"this planet will explode in 5 MINUTES!!\" doled out between 10 episodes). \n\n\"no, no, no, you see, they NEED there to be more talking than fighting during the fight scenes because they want to tell a slowburn of a story! If you don't have the patience to accept the authors brilliance that's okay, but it isn't lazy padding!!\" \n\nTeam four star made an entire career off this exact meta-commentary stuff. Hell, I really like the Boys, but season 3 (my 2nd favorite season) had a ton of terrible, awful writing. It also had good writing too, but I acknowledge both. If next season the show turns more stupid, I'm out, but that's besides the point. \n\nThe writing between character drama in the umbrella academy IS objectively bad. That is a deal breaker for those of us who don't like the characters enough to stick around. I'm not saying nothing in the show is well written, but it IS flawed, and it wasn't intentional unless they are being purposefully lazy. \n\n/End Rant.",

She's likely written that way, and if that's the case, bravo, they did their job.

I thought it was something that the previous 2 seasons lacked - a breather episode to just focus in on the characters and the relationships. For a series that is typically paced in a way that carries us from crisis to crisis, usually bridged by poor communication, having an episode where the characters just talked to each other for purposes not relating to the immediate plot was refreshing.",

                    "comment": "Season 1's \"I Think We're Alone Now\" was brilliant, and is one of the things that got me into the show as a whole. First, the song is a really appropriate choice as a pop song appropriate to the era when the characters were kids, and therefore makes sense as a song Alison would play. Seeing all the characters dancing in their own way showcased their personalities - from Diego's flair to Klaus' hamminess to Vanya and Luther's awkward shuffles - and that cross-sectional shot of the house managed to orient us to this large, otherwise confusing space in an instant. **Edit: also, while the song is meant to be taken as a hopeful, teenage love song, the words of the song perfectly matched what we were seeing onscreen - all of the siblings think of themselves as alone, and it's beautiful and sad on its own to see them all react to this scene by dancing, but in separate rooms with no knowledge of what the others are doing. These people really ARE alone now, but they're demonstrating their isolation in a strangely hopeful, uplifting way. And, finally, the lyrics of the song actually foreshadow the final episode of the season, when** &gt;!Vanya is able to escape her soundproof chamber by channeling her own heartbeat. \"The beating of her heart is the only sound\" indeed.!&lt; This sequence conveyed so much to us in a single scene of the first episode that it convinced me I was watching something special, and I think in my first viewing of the season I ignored/excused a lot of the weaker elements of the writing because I was riding the high of how good that first episode was. It might also be one of my favourite TV examples of using diagetic music to enhance a scene, in a show where so much of the music is non-diagetic.\n\nI don't even know what people are referring to with season 2's dance sequence, I barely remember but think there was one at the salon and one at Klaus' mansion? I thought both were fine.... it was fun to see a scene of the characters goofing off in each other's company. I guess you could say it's a sign of their growing closeness, if you choose to contrast it to season 1's \"I Think We're Alone Now\" scene, and when taken in that way you can see the forward motion of three of the siblings openly goofing off and having fun in each others' company when compared to the rather stilted interactions and limited warmth of the entire first season. So yeah, it was fine. I don't love it, it didn't blow me away like season 1, but it was a cathartic scene.\n\nSeason 3's \"Footloose\" was awful. It was like the anti-\"I Think We're Alone Now\": similar-era pop song, but seemingly for no other reason than because the writers have now decided that they're the show that does silly dance scenes to pop songs. The dance did nothing to showcase the characters' personalities, since the whole thing was a hallucination from Diego. Despite the parallels of taking place in the house, in the season's first episode, the sequence accomplished none of the things \"I Think We're Alone Now\" did... we got more information about the characters and the setting from the following fight scene, and the dance should have just been skipped entirely.\n\nAnyway, the point of writing this is just to say that season 1's dance scene was so much more than just \"a dance scene\", and subsequent seasons - season 3 in particular - seemed to take all the style of the scene with none of the substance. If season 4 does choose to have a dance scene, I seriously hope the writers go back and reflect on what made the first one so great.",

But even there, the air of negativity and moroseness began to predominate, and it became too enervating for me.  It wasn't bad or anything, just depressing. Perhaps that's the appeal, I don't know. I am not really the typical audience for it but like to experiment. \n\nSeems to me that angst fuels most of the superhero shows, and I find it overdone as a narrative choice, much as I am tired of dystopian narratives. But the fans eat it up, so I guess I am resigned to keep sampling one show after another, leaving it way before they resolve things. This show made it through season 4? Wow.",

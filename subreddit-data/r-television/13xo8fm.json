    "postText": "\"Prestige tv\" is sometimes just considered really great tv but in practice there are generally a series of specific tropes one associates with prestige tv besides just high quality. For example, protagonists that are awful people, r rating, crime, gritty realism. It's entirely possible to make a tv show that's a masterpiece but lacks any of those tropes, such as Avatar: The Last Airbender. It's also entirely possible to make a tv show that has all those tropes but is total garbage. I think the last few seasons of Game Of Thrones are the most obvious example, can anyone think of any others?",

Also NBC was afraid to play up the religion during ads so the promos were mostly just nice shots of butterflies and it ended up getting moved to Saturdays after 4 episodes",

Doctor Who kind of had a history of being a good show in spite of its low budget special effects. The last season I watched with Jodi Whittaker is the best the show has ever looked from a visual standpoint, but it suffered from a writing standpoint. A lot of people blame the actors, but I really do think that the quality of writing has gone down, and I have been seeing this a lot lately with tv shows that look like they could be movies, but the writing is just not up to par. Also the streaming ecosystem has kind of killed the prestige tv concept because everything is expendable. Good shows get cancelled while keeping old ip because you know that people will always watch Star Trek, but will people watch something new? Notably, a lot of Netflix shows that last for one season and beloved shows that get abruptly cancelled. HBO Max had the opposite problem where for a time they were taking chances on new writers and new tv concepts (I don\u2019t think this is happening anymore because of the discovery merger) I remember there was a show called Made for Love, which was a really interesting sci-fi show about a woman dealing with an abusive husband, but they cancelled it on a cliffhanger (presumably because of the merger which happened to a lot of HBO shows). Then you have Disney trying to pretend like half of its shows don\u2019t exist, pulling them from streaming. I don\u2019t think streaming makes the kind of money these companies thought it would, and are having trouble justifying the expense of a prestige tv show.",

Most sci-fi gets excluded from that since, traditionally, sci-fi is (too often) seen as a \"low culture\" kind of thing, or at least \"mid-culture\" at best, but almost never highfalutin or classy (with a very few exceptions like some of Denis Villeneuve's work like Arrival \\[2016\\]).\n\nIf anything, it's Chris Chibnall's previous show Broadchurch that was (wrongly IMHO) elevated to \"prestige TV\" levels even though its scripts were not that great. As I've written elsewhere in this thread, all the talent was in the show's other elements but the scripts were, at best, nothing special, except maybe in the beginning of season 1. Chibs can write a strong beginning sometimes, but isn't always so great at middles, and is terrible at endings -- a pattern you can see him repeat again, but harder, with his Doctor Who work. If BC hadn't been so successful, CC probably never would've gotten that showrunner gig. So a supposedly \"prestige\" TV show's success definitely changed the course of Doctor Who's history and nearly got it cancelled, but DW wasn't prestige itself.",

I think Breaking Bad is Halloween and House of Cards is F13 movies. House of Cards is the dumber version where people just want to see Jason gore some people and titties (watch Frank beat everyone). It doesn't really have the skill of Breaking Bad.",

Just a total mess of a second season.\n\nLow Winter Sun was supposed to be the next big AMC drama, and flopped pretty hard.\n\nThose are the two that stand out to me, but there jave been plenty of swings and misses by TNT to make their \"big hit show\" and none of them landed.",

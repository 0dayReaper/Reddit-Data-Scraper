People came out hating it from the jump. But we\u2019ll see how the second episode plays out tonight. \n\nOverall, Depp\u2019s acting is actually really good, impressive even. The Weeknd\u2019s acting SO FAR is not great. He\u2019s supposed to be this mysterious guy exactly as you described and kinda creepy. His character is supposed to be making us a little uneasy, but his character should definitely be drawing the viewer in. His performance is close but not really believeAbel.\n\n *PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER* \n\n(I had to, sorry lmaoo)\n\nHis acting at times feels like he\u2019s just reciting lines sometimes. But like I already said, I wanna give the show a shot, and I wanna see if his performance improves.",

LRD was great but I just didn't like her 'team' around her. It was a jumbles of ideas that didn't really take me anywhere. \n\nWeeknd stuff in the back half was more intriguing. I'm not sure I understand all the hate about his acting. \n\nAnd I thought the pilot ended on a strong note, intriguing me into watching more. \n\nIt just wants to be 'sleazy' so badly... which is fine, but sometimes it comes at the cost of good characters (i.e., her 'team')",

At this point, I'm gambling on artistic intelligence behind this level of ubiquitous, stifling superficiality.\n\nI just watched one of the best eps of Euphoria (S2E5) and feel like I'm digging deeper than ever Levinson's mastery of subjectivity.  It isn't as simple as telling a story from a character's perspective, but rather making every single artistic choice in how the story is told what the character would probably want.  When the show focusses on Rue's storyline, I'm almost rooting for her to be able to stay on drugs and for her lies to work, 'cause that's what she wants, and we're in her world.\n\nThe first ep of The Idol feels like, if Jocelyn were given a budget and basic filmmaking chops, what she would make about herself.  She is, as the first scene specifies, a tragic figure who makes mental illness sexy and is vulnerable but also a victim but mostly a hero, is seeking truth but surrounded by sycophants, is brave enough to want, 'an a%%hole' who will tell her the truth.  Her confidence and her insecurity is generic and dull; her arcs and expressions and vibe is cut from a mold.  \n\nShe lives in world where she really does get to direct her own reality.  Consider the sparse, absurd characterizations of her staff.  They talk so fast and each have their little role to play, but not one of them (1) has an adult life or any inclination of an inner life apart from their job with her, and (2) not one of them says anything negative about Jocelyn.  There are no exceptions; even the reporter and her best friend basically drool over her.  We aren't watching an omniscient narrator give us complicated people.  We're seeing her staff the way that she sees them, the way she would write them if she had written the show.\n\nThat level of vapidity takes real commitment.  There are no false stakes in this show, no cheap shots to get us to actually care about...anything.  Is there anything more depressingly pointless than a wealthy second-tier pop-star having an affair with an egotistical club promotor while she waits to find out whether her song about being freaky in bed is a massive hit or just a solid hit?  This a compelling portrait of an uncompelling reality.  In the writing and the characterizations, there is not an ounce of intelligence/wisdom that surpasses Jocelyn's intelligence.  Which, I think, takes real intelligence.  I think this show might turn out to be a backdoor masterpiece, something that captures an aristocrat's POV far better than more conventionally good TV...",

What I want for this show is for it to find it's own unique genre as it digs deeper into Jocelyn's banal psyche and wherever it goes, we're in it with her by the end.\n\nIt also could become Weeknd and Levinson's hit-piece on pop-music, with Tedros name-checking great pop stars and pop music (in the first ep, we have Madonna playing in the club and mini-lectures on how great Prince and Donna Summers are; perhaps a preview of more to come) and Jocelyn is kinda the butt of an unfunny joke as Tedros tries to use their affair to make her music better, fails, shrugs it off, and it's all sort of a boring F-u to pop music.  That show would kinda suck.  \n\nAlso, it might be that the critics are right - this is trying to be satire of Hollywood/Pop/LA culture, a la Entourage or Californication; it's trying to be biting and fast and witty, like Veep and Succession, but it's just..... really bad.  It's not re-inventing the genre, it's just poorly done.  I hope that that's not the case, but it totally could be at this point.  \n\nWe'll see.  I think that this show will surprise us, but good artists can also just strike out sometimes, and that might have happened, too.",

It's by no means superb or groundbreaking, but I don't think it deserves the absolute annihilation of 24%. I'm probably going to be downvoted, but I just wanted to maybe provide a closer look as to why I/people in general might like this show. \n\nI have no previous opinion on Lily Rose Depp, but I actually thought her acting was fine. Her character is a young popstar being exploited by an industry while dealing with the death of her mother. People are saying her acting is \"boring\" or \"dead\", but to me, she very much embodies a young girl who has no idea what direction she's going, surrounded by people she can't trust to tell her the truth. Maybe I'm just a very specific target audience, but I actually really empathized with her. I went to college in LA and have partied like her, explored my sexual desires much like she has, and drowned all of my problems in a haze of alcohol, sex, and self-destruction. It's a weird feeling, to feel so empty inside that any form of desire or interest from any man at all, however creepy or lame or ugly, can still make me feel alive. Honestly I'm probably drawn to this show because of how uncomfortable it makes me to realize that I was similar to her (in emotions, not looks, because she is super fucking hot and a popstar, of which I'm not lol) To me, all of the nudity/sex made sense to me. She's clearly attractive and she has been told all her life that sex sells, so why wouldn't she be performative for the male gaze? It took me a long time to break out of that myself, and I still struggle sometimes with my mindset. Do I think Sam Levinson is too gratuitous with sex/nudity? Yes. Does it make sense in this context though? Yes. (For now.)\n\nAnyways, moving onto dialogue. Some parts (especially Abel's) are pretty stiff and I actually don't understand why his opinion has any hold over her? She seems to want to make an impact or tell a message through her music, but he's just a club owner/potential cult leader, not even in the music industry lol?? I didn't understand why his words held so much weight in her mind, no matter how much they made sense. Other parts of the dialogue, though, did catch my notice and impress me. When she's talking with her best friend on the couch, it was very natural and LA-like to me to inject a few \"like\"s, and even her comment about liking his \"rapeyness\" was extremely cringe, but so real lmao I've definitely said shit like that before in my immature days, so I actually really liked that part no matter how much I don't agree or condone girls liking \"rapeyness\". \n\nI think her actual song is not that bad. It's cookie-cutter pop, but it has a catchy beat (kinda TheWeekend-like tbh) and I don't think we're actually supposed to love the song. It's clear she's embarrassed by it, so I'm not sure why people are hating on it so much. What I do wish we knew as viewers though, is what exactly she wants to achieve through her music. We know she doesn't like this single, but what does she want? We still don't know, and idk if that was intentional or not. \n\nLast specific thing I will address, though, is Jennie. I'm actually a huge fan of hers and was looking forward to her acting debut, but I was honestly disappointed. Her delivery of the lines were stiff, and even her facial expression in the sauna was very confusing. What emotion was she trying to portray there? Not sure, but I do hope to see more of her and I hope her acting will get better!! \n\nAnyways, this became way too long but I hope it offers anyone some insight on why some people might be into this show! I actually loved the cinematography, I enjoyed the dance scenes in the club actually, it really reflects how I feel when I'm fucked up on the dance floor, and I think LRD is SUPER hot and I don't mind her nudity at all. I loved her red robe, her outfit and sunglasses when she was talking to the reporter, and the way she looked when she was chain-smoking. I think it's so aesthetic, but obviously, smoking is bad for your health(!!) but I can admit it looks sexy/it tracks in a very \"i'm self-destructive and sexy\" way lol\nI heard it's only 6 episodes, so you can bet I'll watch all 6. Maybe my opinion will change, but as of now, I think the pilot is way less terrible than the press is making it out to be.",

If HBO were to speak with social workers and women's health organizations that work specifically with victims of domestic abuse they would learn that strangulation, even strangulation disguised as a consenting sex act is the most worrying report they can hear from a victim in an abusive situation, as victims that end up murdered by their partners more than any other form of physical or sexual abuse have previously been strangled by their partner. It is one of the most dangerous things that can happen to a victim of DV and is frequently seen in the history of abuse in cases that end with a woman being killed by her abuser. \n\nIt is very, very serious if your partner ever strangles you without previously discussing it at length and taking safety precautions.  Sam straight up tried to sexualize and glamourize one of the most dangerous and concerning acts an abuser can commit. \n\nAn abuser and rapist would love this show as it essentially validates his view of women and relationships,",

I'm just honestly curious, more so on the topic of Sam Levinson and his definitely polarizing vibe: does \"Euphoria\" work more as a series because it has a sympathetic (for lack of a better word) lead character as portrayed by Zendaya? Like, a lot of the characters on Euphoria would be all but dead in real-life for their vices/hedonism, but I'm wondering if, for Euphoria's core audience, The Weeknd and Lily Depp are just past that point of sympathy or realism?",

Zendaya and Sweeney are wasting their talent on that show.

If the writer has nothing interesting to say, offers no insight or nuance or feels they are too superior to even make something entertaining than why are they even writing this story?  \n\nIf the only commentary Levinson is capable of is \"look how vapid and over sexual L.A. is,\" than maybe he's not the thought provoking artist he thinks he is. Maybe he's even more shallow than the people he tries to critic. If all a creator can bring to the table is attempt to shock and create controversy than that creator is guaranteed to become irrelevant as the audience becomes desensitized and grows tired of their escalating bids for attention. \n\nAs any child knows acting out can get you alot of attention and you may even get your way in the beginning, but people don't really respect you and sooner or later everyone gets tired of your antics. If controversy and exploitation is all Levinson has to offer than his expiration date is nearing.\n\nControversy is the last bastion of the immature and the desperate. I think celebrity culture and influencer culture has taught us that if nothing else. \n\nIt's always the least talented and the least self-aware that resort to controversy as there \"thing.\" \n\nI feel like everyone can sense Lenvinson's desperation to be noticed and to be taken seriously and it feels like cringe.",

That is this show. \n\nIt's very self-serious and lacks substance. BUT - go into it knowing it's just something to watch and maybe you'll still get a kick out of it. There's not much under the surface of pretense, and I realized quickly that I could turn my brain off for this one. Some shows are good for watching with your switch off, and beginning with that set expectation might improve your viewing. \n\nIt seemed interesting at first, with Hank Azaria and the assistant/best friend character's interactions, but soon it becomes apparent that the characters *surrounding* the main characters are way more interesting, and are much better actors - that's not good.\n\nThe writing is laughable at some points, in such a way that I can't decide if it is intentional satire or comedically pretentious. Probably not intentional, and it doesn't land either way. The world-building is pretty great, and the musical scoring is on-point.  I immediately wondered who produced the theme that appears throughout.\n\nI had no expectations - haven't seen Levinson's other works, haven't seen Rose-Depp in anything, don't listen to the Weeknd, but I'll watch the next one to get a better feel for it.",

There\u2019s always a subtle underlying humour throughout his films, where the satire is accentuated by his refusal to take the stories too seriously. All this to say that the biggest thing working against The Idol is that it feels like it takes itself way too seriously for what\u2019s supposed to be a satire. It just all felt like well photographed nothing",

I find that his sensibilities hit harder when he worked within the Hollywood studio system. Start with his sci-fi satires (Robocop, Total Recall, and Starship Troopers). Then, I\u2019d say watch his thriller films Basic Instinct, Elle, and Bendetta (the latter two being his most recent films, and all three being most in line with \u2018The Idol\u2019s erotic thriller vibe). Once you have a good handle of his sensibilities and what his style is, I\u2019d say take the gamble and watch \u2018Showgirls\u2019. \u2018Showgirls\u2019 is often considered to be a seminal \u201cso bad that it\u2019s good\u201d film, but I think that there is a lot to genuinely be enjoyed about it. \n\nI\u2019m not as familiar with his Dutch films, as they are a bit more difficult to get a hold of, but the ones listed above are pretty easy to track down! [Also, check out this great video essay on his work from one of my favourite film YouTubers, if you have the time.](https://youtu.be/OaPlyLYFZkg)",

Verhoeven\u2019s sensibilities never feel self serving. They always feel like they are in service of the overall narrative and highlighting the films theme. When we start seeing people get brutally killed in \u2018Starship Troopers\u2019, it\u2019s a stark contrast to the gung-ho jingoistic optimism that permeates the front half of the film. There\u2019s a purpose to the absurdity. With Levinson though, the over the top nature always feels more in service of him. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to shock for the sake of it. And Tedros talking in the mirror didn\u2019t feel that absurd to me. It just felt like a moment to highlight that he\u2019s a living facade. \n\nMy main point is that The Idol lacks the underlying playfulness and humour that makes Verhoeven\u2019s work so great.",

Let\u2019s not forget the that from the description of this show he is supposed to be a cult leader. And I think the show drops plenty of hints that the viewer is supposed to be cautious of his intentions towards Jocelyn. Such as how he clocks her in the distance and the show makes it a point of showing that twice like he\u2019s targeting her not just interested. Also how Jocelyn takes him as suave but her friend seems clearly creeped out when she greets him at the door. I also think the early scene about the issues over her going nude in the shoot is foreshadowing a conflict between those in her life who will try and protect her from the influence in this cult and those who either encourage it or turn a blind eye.\n\nThat said, the weekend\u2019s acting was indeed pretty bad unless that was the Meta where he is a cult leader pretending to be someone he isn\u2019t and he just has us all fooled lol.\n\nEdit: I should probably disclaim that I wouldn\u2019t say I liked it either, it was a little cringe at times and there a lot of weird tonal issues with how jokes were delivered. The worst part of all is how it does almost feel like a weird vanity project for The Weeknd from at least this first episode. Hopefully the show starts to go somewhere interesting but if not, maybe it will turn out like a TV version of \u201cThe Room\u201d",

Your mileage may vary, but this is the reverse - bad actor takes over and makes show about him &amp; his bad performance. Does the satire work as well if it\u2019s accidental? I haven\u2019t watched this but fascinating case study.",

Interesting points. \"Showgirls\" is a whole blooming onion of crazy, so sorry for getting off the point. The only two who survived that were Gina Gershon and Gina Ravera.",

He failed in gaining the Republican audience, and he turned off a lot of people who were still watching CNN.\n\nHe wanted Trump back on the channel and this was the result.

The only real play would be to present themselves as an actual unbiased fact-based news source, something the US sorely needs and cable news does not provide.

For example, the cost of advertising during NASCAR and Golf broadcasts is *almost* as high as NBA or NFL. The reason is those audiences are super niche, and there is no other way to get that collective group in one fell swoop. With golf, what other tv broadcast is watched primarily by rich white guys in finance? If not for golf, luxury watch brands and strange ETFs would have to advertise in 12 different places to reach them all. Same with NASCAR, but a different niche.\n\nSo if their goal was to build an ad revenue business, that's even more reason to lean into an ideology. Being able to capture a plurality of one specific type of audience would have gotten them higher ad revenue. But having a small slice of center is not unique for advertising, that's table stakes. In other words, in advertising, it's better to have 60% of a niche which is 5% of the population, than 5% of a 60% general swath of the population.",

            "comment": "How are we gonna cover Trump? That\u2019s not something I stay up at night thinking about,\u201d Chris Licht told me. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple.\u201d\n\nIt was the fall of 2022. This was the first of many on-the-record interviews that Licht had agreed to give me, and I wanted to know how CNN\u2019s new leader planned to deal with another Donald Trump candidacy. Until recently Licht had been producing a successful late-night comedy show. Now, just a few months into his job running one of the world\u2019s preeminent news organizations, he claimed to have a \u201csimple\u201d answer to the question that might very well come to define his legacy.\n\n\u201cThe media has absolutely, I believe, learned its lesson,\u201d Licht said.\n\nSensing my surprise, he grinned.\n\n\u201cI really do,\u201d Licht said. \u201cI think they know that he\u2019s playing them\u2014at least, the people in my organization. We\u2019ve had discussions about this. We know that we\u2019re getting played, so we\u2019re gonna resist it.\u201d\n\nSeven months later, in Manchester, New Hampshire, I came across Licht wearing the expression of a man who had just survived a car wreck. Normally brash and self-assured, Licht was pale, his shoulders slumped. He scanned the room with anxious eyes. Spotting me, he summoned a breezy chord. \u201cWell,\u201d Licht said, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t boring!\u201d\n\nWe were standing in the lobby of the Dana Center, on the campus of Saint Anselm College. Licht, the 51-year-old chair and CEO of CNN Worldwide, had spent the past hour and a half inside a trailer behind the building, a control room on wheels from which he\u2019d orchestrated a CNN town hall with Trump. Licht had known the risks inherent to this occasion: Trump had spent the past six years insulting and threatening CNN, singling out the network and its journalists as \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d rhetoric that had led to death threats, blacklists, and ultimately a severing of diplomatic ties between Trump and CNN leadership.\n\nBut that had been under the old regime. When he took the helm of CNN, in May 2022, Licht had promised a reset with Republican voters\u2014and with their leader. He had swaggered into the job, telling his employees that the network had lost its way under former President Jeff Zucker, that their hostile approach to Trump had alienated a broader viewership that craved sober, fact-driven coverage. These assertions thrust Licht into a two-front war: fighting to win back Republicans who had written off the network while also fighting to win over his own journalists, many of whom believed that their new boss was scapegoating them to appease his new boss, David Zaslav, who\u2019d hired Licht with a decree to move CNN toward the ideological center.\n\nOne year into the job, Licht was losing both battles. Ratings, in decline since Trump left office, had dropped to new lows. Employee morale was even worse. A feeling of dread saturated the company. Licht had accepted the position with ambitions to rehabilitate the entire news industry, telling his peers that Trump had broken the mainstream media and that his goal was to do nothing less than \u201csave journalism.\u201d But Licht had lost the confidence of his own newsroom. Because of this, he had come to view the prime-time event with Trump as the moment that would vindicate his pursuit of Republican viewers while proving to his employees that he possessed a revolutionary vision for their network and the broader news media.",

                    "comment": "Trump had other ideas.\n\nFor 70 minutes in Manchester, the former president overpowered CNN\u2019s moderator, Kaitlan Collins, with a continuous blast of distortion, hyperbole, and lies. The audience of Trump devotees delighted in his aggression toward Collins, cheering him on so loudly and so purposefully that what began as a journalistic forum devolved into a WWE match before the first voter asked a question. Vince McMahon himself could not have written a juicier script: Trump was the heroic brawler\u2014loathed by the establishment, loved by the masses\u2014trying to reclaim a title wrongly taken from him, while Collins, standing in for the villainous elites who dared to question the protagonist\u2019s virtue, was cast as the heel. \u201cShe\u2019s not very nice,\u201d Trump told the studio audience, pointing toward Collins while she stood just offstage during the first commercial break.\n\nTrump could be excused for thinking this was exactly what Licht wanted. The famously transactional ex-president had wondered aloud to his top aides, during their negotiations with CNN executives, what the network stood to gain from this production; when CNN made the decision to stock the auditorium with Republicans, the only thing Trump could figure was that Licht wanted a prime-time spectacle to resuscitate the network\u2019s moribund ratings. The two men spoke only briefly backstage. \u201cHave fun,\u201d Licht told him. Trump obliged. He demeaned the woman, E. Jean Carroll, whom a jury had one day earlier found him liable for sexually abusing. He repeated disproved fictions about election fraud and suggested that he would separate families at the southern border again if given the chance. He insulted Collins, calling her \u201ca nasty person\u201d as the crowd hissed in agreement. At one point, when she and Trump assumed their marks onstage after another commercial break, Collins politely reminded him not to step past the giant red CNN logo in front of them. Trump responded by gesturing as though he might stomp on it. The crowd roared in approval.\n\nFrom the September 2022 issue: Caitlin Dickerson on the secret history of the Trump administration\u2019s family-separation policy\n\nLicht had not wanted this. Sure, he was chasing ratings; in nearly 20 years as a showrunner, ratings had been his currency. But Licht had come to Manchester with bigger ambitions than lifting CNN out of the viewership basement for a single evening in May. He believed that Trump owed his initial political ascent in part to the media\u2019s habit of marginalizing conservative views and Republican voters. That needed to change ahead of 2024. Licht wasn\u2019t scared to bring a bunch of MAGA enthusiasts onto his set\u2014he had remarked to his deputies, in the days before the town hall, about the \u201cextra Trumpy\u201d makeup of the crowd CNN was expecting\u2014and he damn sure wasn\u2019t scared of Trump. The way to deal with a bully like Trump, Licht told his journalists, was to confront him with facts.\n\nCollins tried to do just that. She was, however, no match for the environment she\u2019d been thrust into. Squaring off one-on-one against the country\u2019s most accomplished trickster is difficult enough, but this was 300-on-one. The result was a campaign infomercial: Trump the populist champion, slaying his old nemesis and asserting to televised fanfare his claim to the presidency.\n\n\u201cDoes CNN count that as an in-kind campaign donation?\u201d the longtime broadcaster Dan Rather tweeted.\n\nRather\u2019s comment was gentle compared with the torrent of criticism aimed at CNN. \u201cReady to call it: This was a terrible idea,\u201d the conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru tweeted, just nine minutes into the event. \u201cCNN should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d tweeted Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cThis is an absolute joke,\u201d tweeted former Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger. \u201cChris Licht is rapidly becoming the Elon Musk of CNN,\u201d tweeted The Bulwark\u2019s Charlie Sykes.",

                            "comment": "When Licht found me in the lobby, commenting on how not boring the night had been, it wasn\u2019t clear how much of the blowback he\u2019d already seen. What was clear was that Licht knew this was bad\u2014very, very bad. Republicans were angry at CNN. Democrats were angry at CNN. Journalists were angry at CNN. The only one who wasn\u2019t angry, it seemed, was Trump, most likely because he\u2019d succeeded in disgracing the network on its own airwaves.\n\nI felt for Licht. Having spent long stretches of the past year in conversation with him as he attempted to build \u201cthe new CNN,\u201d I often found myself agreeing with his principles of journalism. Some media figures had trashed Licht for hosting the town hall in the first place, arguing that nothing good could come from \u201cplatforming\u201d a man who\u2019d tried to sabotage the peaceful transition of power. Licht disagreed\u2014and so did I. Trump was the runaway favorite for the GOP nomination and a decent bet to occupy the White House in two years. The media had every obligation to scrutinize him, interview him, and, yes, platform him.\n\nAs I\u2019d settled into my seat in the Saint Anselm auditorium, however, I had been startled by my surroundings. This was no ordinary collection of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, as CNN had claimed it would be. Most of them were diehards, fanboys, political zealots who were likelier to show up at a rally with a MAGA flag than come to a coffee shop with a policy question. These folks hadn\u2019t turned out to participate in some good-faith civic ritual. They were there to celebrate Trump\u2019s continued assault on the media.\n\nLicht\u2019s theory of CNN\u2014what had gone wrong, how to fix it, and why doing so could lift the entire industry\u2014made a lot of sense. The execution of that theory? Another story. Every move he made, big programming decisions and small tactical maneuvers alike, seemed to backfire. By most metrics, the network under Licht\u2019s leadership had reached its historic nadir. In my conversations with nearly 100 employees at CNN, it was clear that Licht needed a win\u2014a big win\u2014to keep the place from falling apart. The Trump town hall was supposed to be that win. It had to be that win. And yet, once again, the execution had failed.\n\nPulling me into a darkened corridor just outside the auditorium, Licht tried to compose himself. He and I had spent many hours discussing what he described as \u201cthe mission\u201d of CNN. I asked Licht whether the town hall had advanced that mission. He bit his lip.\n\n\u201cToo early to say,\u201d Licht replied.\n\nDuring our first interview, over breakfast last fall, Licht made a point of assuring me: David Zaslav had his back.\n\nLicht was off to a slow start\u2014understandably so. CNN was still staggering from the forced resignation of Zucker, a beloved figure who had been defenestrated for sleeping with his second in command, and the firing of Chris Cuomo, the prime-time star who, in addition to shattering ethical standards by advising his politician brother, had a #MeToo problem. (Zucker declined to comment for this article; Cuomo has denied allegations of sexual misconduct.) Meanwhile, the ownership change that preceded Licht\u2019s arrival\u2014AT&amp;T spun off WarnerMedia, which then merged with Discovery Inc. to create Warner Bros. Discovery\u2014had been messier than expected. Thanks to shaky balance sheets, followed by an inflation crisis, Warner Bros. Discovery saw its stock price drop by half within months of its launch. Days before Licht assumed control of CNN, its new parent company announced the termination of CNN+, a streaming platform that had been hailed as the future of the company.",

                                    "comment": "There was never going to be much goodwill between Warner Bros. Discovery and the journalists at CNN. In November 2021, not long after the corporate takeover was announced, John Malone, a right-wing billionaire who stood to become a major shareholder on the new Warner Bros. Discovery board, said that CNN could learn a few things from the reporters at Fox News. \u201cI would like to see CNN evolve back to the kind of journalism that it started with, and actually have journalists, which would be unique and refreshing,\u201d Malone told CNBC. After Zucker was sacked, Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, exacerbated these tensions by choosing Licht without interviewing any of CNN\u2019s internal candidates. Zaslav told numerous people that he needed an outsider to revamp CNN\u2019s journalistic practices because Republican politicians had told him they were no longer willing to come on the network\u2014a rationale that worried staffers there.\n\nThe CNN rank and file were nonetheless excited by the arrival of Licht, who had earned the reputation of a boy-genius producer from his work on Morning Joe and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. But things went sideways fast. A few weeks into his tenure, Licht instructed his producers to downplay the first hearing of the January 6 committee\u2014an event that MSNBC treated like a prime-time special, earning monster ratings that infuriated the CNN staff. Licht expressed regret to some top editorial personnel the day after the hearing. Still, the incident proved unnerving. Journalists at the network already had reason to question the motives of Malone and Zaslav; now they were wary of Licht, too. When the new CEO began making public confessions of CNN\u2019s past sins\u2014which sometimes came across like an endorsement of Trump\u2019s attacks on the network\u2014the wariness gave way to wrath. Top talent began to turn on Licht. Rumors of a spoiled honeymoon spread through the industry. By the time Licht announced forthcoming layoffs to his employees\u2014there would be more than 300 in total\u2014in an email sent two days before our October breakfast, CNN was spiraling.\n\nDrinking from a glass of iced coffee, Licht shrugged it all off: the internal leaks, the external media swarm, the printed columns and whispered anecdotes accusing him of remaking CNN into Fox News Lite. \u201cThis is too important for me to be worried about what someone\u2019s calling me or suggesting I\u2019m trying to be,\u201d Licht said. \u201cThis is so mission-driven and so important. I genuinely am\u2014I get mad, I get frustrated, but it doesn\u2019t, like, affect me. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t make sense. Matt Dornic offered to translate. Dornic, who was accompanying us in his capacity as CNN\u2019s senior vice president of communications\u2014and, I would learn, as a mainstay of Licht\u2019s small entourage\u2014explained that what upsets the new boss isn\u2019t harsh coverage of him personally, but rather bad press about CNN\u2019s journalists. Dornic cited recent reports about how Jake Tapper\u2019s experimental show in the 9 p.m. hour\u2014the slot vacated by Cuomo, which had yet to be permanently filled\u2014was drawing anemic numbers. Licht pointed a finger at Dornic.\n\n\u201cWhat drives me nuts,\u201d he said, \u201cis that has the potential to throw my group off the mission.\u201d\n\nI asked Licht to explain that mission to me, as plainly as possible.\n\n\u201cJournalism. Being trusted. Everyone has an agenda, trying to shape events or shape thought. There has to be a source of absolute truth,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s good actors, there\u2019s bad actors, there\u2019s a lot of shit in the world. There has to be something that you\u2019re able to look at and go, \u2018They have no agenda other than the truth.\u2019\u201d",

                                            "comment": "Journalism was Licht\u2019s first love. Raised in Connecticut, the son of a doctor and a physician assistant, he anchored make-believe newscasts in his basement as a grade-schooler. He studied broadcasting at Syracuse University then moved to Los Angeles, where, after a right-place, right-time chance to cover the O. J. Simpson trial, he got hooked on producing news. With a boyish tousle of blond hair and that bottomless supply of self-confidence, Licht talked his way into bigger and more consequential jobs, eventually finding himself back on the East Coast.\n\nIt was Licht\u2019s relationship with Joe Scarborough, the onetime Florida congressman turned television personality, that opened the biggest doors. First on MSNBC\u2019s Scarborough Country, a prime-time success that featured sharp conservative punditry on all things political and cultural, and then on Morning Joe, Licht distinguished himself as a top-notch executive producer, someone known to run through walls (and run over people) to make great television. Mike Barnicle, a Morning Joe contributor, nicknamed Licht \u201cCaptain Intense.\u201d But the intensity caught up with him. Licht suffered a brain hemorrhage at 38 and began to reassess his life and career. A few years later, Licht left MSNBC to run the morning show at CBS, and then left the news business altogether, joining Stephen Colbert as the showrunner of The Late Show.\n\nLicht had a superlative arrangement with Colbert: more money, fewer headaches, better hours. Only one job, he told me, could have justified leaving that life and returning to the grind of journalism. And then the offer came: Zaslav, who had been courting Licht informally long before the WarnerMedia\u2013Discovery merger was complete, asked him in early 2022 to lead the new CNN.\n\nLicht knew \u201cimmediately\u201d that he had to accept. Yet he was not oblivious to the challenges that awaited. His wife, Jenny Blanco, had worked for CNN as a producer. He knew some of the premier on-air talent. Both Colbert and Scarborough warned him not to take the job, and Licht understood their reservations. He had watched, over the previous five years, as the network became more polarizing. When I asked Licht what he\u2019d thought about CNN\u2014as a viewer, and as a seasoned journalist himself\u2014while working on Colbert\u2019s show, he hesitated, searching for the words.\n\n\u201cI thought, I\u2019m having a tough time discerning between \u2018How much are we getting played as an audience by Trump?\u2019 and how much of it\u2019s actually \u2026\u201d He trailed off.\n\nLicht said Trump had done \u201creally bad shit\u201d as president that reporters sometimes missed because they were obsessing over more sensational stories. Trump had goaded the media with \u201coutrage porn,\u201d provoking journalists to respond with such indignation, so often, that audiences began to tune out. \u201cWhen everything is an 11\u201d on a scale of 10, Licht said, \u201cit means that when there\u2019s something really awful happening, we\u2019re kind of numb to it. That was a strategy. And I felt like the media was falling for that strategy.\u201d\n\nLicht recalled how, early in the Trump administration, a particular reporter hadn\u2019t been allowed into a press gaggle because of a feud with the White House. During a subsequent meeting with his fellow board members at Syracuse\u2019s Newhouse school of journalism, one of them suggested taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times denouncing this affront to the First Amendment. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Guys, keep your powder dry. This is nothing. It\u2019s gonna get much worse,\u2019\u201d Licht said.\n\n\u201cI felt that there was such a mission\u2014\u201d He stopped himself.\n\n\u201cThe mission was to go after this guy\u2014\u201d He stopped again.",

Everything can\u2019t be an 11 because it happens to come from someone you have a visceral hatred for.\u201d\n\nI told Licht that while I agreed with his observation\u2014that Trump had baited reporters into putting on a jersey and entering the game, acting as opposing players instead of serving as commentators or even referees\u2014there was an alternative view. Trump had forced us, by trying to annihilate the country\u2019s institutions of self-government, to play a more active role than many journalists were comfortable with. This wasn\u2019t a matter of advocating for capital-D Democratic policies; it was a matter of advocating for small-d democratic principles. The conflating of the two had proved highly problematic, however, and the puzzle of how to properly cover Trump continued to torment much of the media.\n\nLicht didn\u2019t understand all the fuss. \u201cIf something\u2019s a lie, you call it a lie. You know what you\u2019re dealing with now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he changed the rules of the game, and the media was a little caught off guard and put a jersey on and got into the game as a way of dealing with it. And at least [at] my organization, I think we understand that jersey cannot go back on. Because guess what? It didn\u2019t work. Being in the game with the jersey on didn\u2019t change anyone\u2019s mind.\u201d\n\nThe new boss told people inside CNN that Tapper\u2019s 4 o\u2019clock show, The Lead, was the model: tough, respectful, inquisitive reporting that challenged every conceivable view and facilitated open dialogue.\n\nLicht emphasized certain exceptions to this approach. He would not give airtime to bad actors who spread disinformation. His network would host people who like rain as well as people who don\u2019t like rain. But, he said, CNN would not host people who deny that it\u2019s raining when it is. This was no small caveat: More than half of Republicans in Congress had voted to throw out the electoral votes of Arizona and Pennsylvania based on lies. Meanwhile, plenty of Republicans who weren\u2019t election deniers didn\u2019t want to come on CNN anyway. Sensing this predicament, Licht had traveled to Capitol Hill early in his tenure, meeting with Republican leaders and promising them a fair shake under his leadership.\n\nWhat Licht viewed as a diplomatic visit, his skeptics portrayed as an apology tour. The narrative taking hold in elite media circles\u2014that CNN\u2019s new boss was a scheming, ruthless Roger Ailes wannabe\u2014went into overdrive. Licht was amused at first. But he soon lost his sense of humor. He called Robert Reich and rebuked him after the former labor secretary wrote a Substack post criticizing CNN. He vowed to friends that he would \u201cdestroy\u201d Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist, for a disparaging Los Angeles Times column. Licht seethed about what he saw as a coordinated attack from liberals who feared long-overdue journalistic scrutiny of their ideals.\n\n\u201cYou have a certain segment of society that has had an unfettered megaphone to the leading journalistic organization in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the slightest hint that that organization may not be just taking things that are fed to them from that segment of the population, it must be that a fascist is running the network and he wants to move it to the right \u2026 The fact that I want to give space to the [argument] that this thing everyone agrees with might be not right doesn\u2019t make me a fascist right-winger who\u2019s trying to steal Fox viewers.\u201d\n\nLicht was no fascist. But he was trying to steal viewers from Fox News\u2014and from MSNBC, for that matter. To succeed, Licht said, CNN would need to produce more than just great journalism. Reporting the news in an aggressive, nonpartisan manner would be central to the network\u2019s attempt to win back audiences. But television is, at its essence, entertainment. Viewers would always turn on CNN in times of crisis, Licht told me. What he needed to find out was how many would turn on CNN for fun.",

If you\u2019ve got a specific insight into something, if you can add something, tell us. But don\u2019t comment on every single fucking story.\u201d\n\nLicht had wedged a rolling office chair in between the first and second rows of Control Room B, a darkened space that featured scores of monitors being manipulated by two dozen people in hooded sweatshirts and headsets. Everyone looked tense. They were 96 hours from Election Day 2022, when they would launch CNN This Morning, Licht\u2019s first big swing as the network\u2019s head honcho, and the show looked terrible.\n\n\u201cI want more movement. Lots of movement,\u201d he told Eric Hall, the new program\u2019s executive producer, who sat in the center of the first row. \u201cWhat do I hate the most?\u201d\n\nHall and a younger producer named Zachary Slater responded in unison: \u201cBoxes.\u201d\n\nLicht nodded. \u201cBoxes,\u201d he said, referring to the Brady Bunch look on cable-news screens. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be frenetic, but please make sure there\u2019s movement. We need to see these people.\u201d\n\nMaking good TV is difficult under even the best of conditions. These were not the best of conditions. Eager to put his imprint on CNN, Licht had started with what he knew best\u2014mornings\u2014and hounded his team to get the program ready for Election Day. Rehearsals had been rushed. The co-hosts\u2014Don Lemon, Poppy Harlow, and Kaitlan Collins\u2014were struggling to gel, in part because they had practiced so little together. (On this day, Collins was reporting in Georgia.) Licht had created this trio, created this new show, in hopes of injecting some flavor into CNN\u2019s lineup. He thought partnering Lemon, the opinionated, gay, Black southerner, with a pair of hard-hitting female news reporters could be the \u201cfun\u201d viewers needed. But Licht, I sensed, was not having fun.\n\nWhen the rehearsal went to break, a collective exhale gusted through the room. Licht leaned back, took out his phone, and started scanning a Variety story about his decision to eliminate the CNN documentary unit in the layoffs. After he uttered a few choice phrases\u2014but before we could discuss the article\u2014the show started back up, with the cameras centered on Lemon. He had changed into a white jacket, the collar made of fur, with a turtleneck underneath.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is he wearing?\u201d Licht blurted out. Nervous chuckles echoed around us.\n\nThe shot began zooming out, slowly at first to incorporate the guests, and then rotating around the glass table in the middle of the set. \u201cGood. I love that,\u201d Licht told Hall. \u201cJust slow it down, make it steady.\u201d\n\nA little while later, the younger producer spoke into Lemon\u2019s earpiece: \u201cDon, uhh, we\u2019re not too crazy about the jacket in here.\u201d Lemon looked miffed. Licht fought back a smirk. \u201cWhy are you guys so mean to Don?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe joke wasn\u2019t lost on anyone. Clearly, Licht had dwindling patience for Lemon\u2014his outfits, his ad-libbing, his opinions. None of this should have come as a surprise. Lemon was one of the most polarizing figures in media, someone with undeniable talent and unregulated instincts. Given Licht\u2019s down-the-middle mantra, people inside the network were mystified by his decision to hitch the success of the new morning show to CNN\u2019s chief provocateur. Some believed that Licht had been ordered by Zaslav to remove Lemon from his 10 p.m. slot (Licht denied this). Others sensed that Licht, who had already gotten rid of other \u201coff mission\u201d staffers, including the media reporter Brian Stelter and the White House correspondent John Harwood, would have axed Lemon too, if not for his being one of the lone Black voices on a very white network. Whatever the particulars, the careers of these two men were now intertwined.\n\nAs the show emerged from another break, Lemon, sans jacket, took his place in front of an enormous studio display. At the center were the words an inconvenient truth. Licht asked Hall what this segment was about. Hall replied that Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, had been saying crazy, hateful things for a long time, but corporate America had never abandoned him; only now, after his anti-Semitic rantings, were companies like Adidas dropping him. Lemon was going to ask: Why did those sponsors stick with Ye after his offensive remarks about slavery and other topics, but choose to bail now over his anti-Semitism?",

Hall let out an exasperated grunt. \u201cHow does that happen?\u201d\n\nLicht grimaced. \u201cRead the fucking prompter,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter steering the segment by whispering instructions to Hall\u2014\u201cfull \u2026 move left \u2026 back out \u2026\u201d\u2014Licht glanced over at Ryan Kadro, a top executive who\u2019d worked with Licht at CBS and knew him better than anyone else in this room.

Licht gave his candid feedback\u2014some things had worked, but the Ye segment had not. He wanted less commentary. Above all, he wanted Lemon\u2014and the others\u2014to keep things light in the mornings. Lemon looked hesitant. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be preachy in the morning, but I do want to hold people accountable,\u201d he said. Licht nodded and said he understood. Then he repeated himself: The Ye idea had missed the mark.\n\nWhen Licht left, I sat down with Lemon and Harlow\u2014as well as Dornic, the omnipresent communications executive. Sensing some lingering tension from the earlier exchange, I asked Lemon whether his approach to news meshed with Licht\u2019s. Specifically, I mentioned our \u201coutrage porn\u201d conversation. Lemon squinted at me.\n\n\u201cSome people may want to qualify it as \u2018outrage porn.\u2019 But there was a lot to be outraged for these last few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a tweet or a statement or an action or something that was outrageous a few times a day for five, six years \u2026 What we were doing is, we were fighting for democracy. We were fighting to set the record straight on us being attacked and called \u2018fake\u2019 \u2026 That may have put us back on our heels and made us a bit more aggressive with calling it out, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it was \u2018outrage porn.\u2019\u201d\n\nHarlow saw things somewhat differently\u2014perhaps because of her straight-news background\u2014but Lemon wasn\u2019t having any of it.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are Monday-morning-quarterbacking about what happened\u201d at CNN, Lemon told me. \u201cYou have to remember the time that we were in. Every single day, we were being attacked by the former administration. And that\u2019s not hyperbole \u2026 We had bombs sent to this very network.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Harlow was live on the air when the bomb was detected. She had to evacuate to the street, where she continued broadcasting. It was a traumatic ordeal for all of CNN\u2014and that was Lemon\u2019s point. He had been swamped with threats during Trump\u2019s presidency, followed down the street by menacing figures, given a 24-hour security detail at certain points. Not that it was all about him. What of the unceasing vitriol against women and minorities, public officials and private citizens? It was all outrageous. Was he supposed to pretend to not be outraged?\n\nDornic jumped in. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Chris is even saying\u2014\u201d He paused.\n\n\u201cThis is not about you versus Chris,\u201d Dornic continued. \u201cI think his perspective is: Under a normal administration, those would have been 11s. But you had to recalibrate, because if you make the outrageous thing about women an 11, then what happens when he actually does something completely insane and undermines democracy?\u201d\n\nHarlow, now cast in the role of peacemaker, told Lemon that this seemed like a legitimate point. Just recently, she said, she had told her children the story of the boy who cried wolf. She did worry about Trump\u2019s destruction of norms, but she also worried about a lack of self-awareness displayed by some in her profession. Lemon looked ready to contest that point. Then, perhaps in deference to Harlow, he decided to drop it.",

She said her husband had advised her to switch roles only if it would mean becoming partners with Lemon; Lemon said he wouldn\u2019t have moved to the mornings alongside anyone else. Less clear was where Collins fit into this mix. Barely in her 30s, Collins had in a few years\u2019 time zoomed from entertainment writer at The Daily Caller to chief White House correspondent at CNN. She had serious reporting chops and a deep roster of sources. Everyone at the network could see that Collins was the future of the brand\u2014a next-generation star who could be synonymous with CNN for decades to come. So why take away her prized reporting post and sit her behind a desk with two co-anchors?\n\nNo one really knew. Licht spoke of chemistry and character, of dynamic personalities and geographic diversity. (Lemon is from Louisiana, Harlow from Minnesota, and Collins from Alabama, making them symbolic of a forgotten America that Licht was determined to reach.) But this was mostly game theory. The truth is, Licht didn\u2019t know if it would work. What he did know was that CNN was falling farther behind in the ratings, and that without a daring move, something that could rouse a lethargic network, the discontent would grow louder. Licht remembered what Joe Scarborough used to tell him: \u201cScared money never wins.\u201d\n\nLicht was ready to gamble. He asked Lemon to take the lead, trusted Harlow to be the stabilizer, and hoped Collins could adjust in a hurry. Licht\u2019s formative experience in television had come from watching Scarborough learn to check his ego and build an inclusive, engaging, highly entertaining program. He hoped Lemon could do the same.\n\n\u201cI feel like the senior of the group,\u201d Lemon told us, sitting on the set. He instantly sensed that this was unwise to say out loud. \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d said Harlow, giving him a look. \u201cBut lift us up.\u201d Lemon grabbed her hand: \u201cI\u2019m going to lift you up. I\u2019m not going to try to bigfoot you.\u201d\n\nShe smiled politely. \u201cThere\u2019s none of that on this show.\u201d\n\nIt was 6:07 a.m. and sweat dripped from Licht\u2019s nose.\n\nHe pumped his arms and legs on a machine inside a workout studio two blocks from the Hudson River. Joe Maysonet, a former boxer who wore polka-dot pajama pants, a green oxford shirt, and a peach-colored beanie, stood with his arms crossed, chirping at his client: \u201cDid I say stop? No, I did not!\u201d\n\nThree years ago, Licht weighed 226 pounds. Worried that he was losing control of his lifestyle, he went all in. No more breakfast. No drinking during the week. No more carbs or sweets. (\u201cI\u2019m a fucking machine,\u201d Licht told me one day, when I asked why he was skipping a meal.) He also found Maysonet, whose gym, J Train, caters to New York\u2019s elite\u2014actors, athletes, business tycoons. On this morning, in March 2023, the CNN boss was down to 178 pounds.\n\nLicht jumped off the machine. At Maysonet\u2019s instruction, he squatted down to grab a long metal pole lying flat on the ground. \u201cZucker couldn\u2019t do this shit,\u201d Licht said through clenched teeth, hoisting the pole with a grunt.\n\nWorking in the shadow of Jeff Zucker, a hugely popular figure who had overseen the highest-rated, most profitable years in CNN\u2019s history, was never going to be easy. But Licht had made it harder than it needed to be. Among the first things he did, after taking over, was turn Zucker\u2019s old office on the 17th floor\u2014across from the bullpen, right near key studios and control rooms\u2014into a conference room. Then he decamped to the 22nd floor, setting up in a secluded space that most staffers didn\u2019t know how to find. It became symbolic of Licht\u2019s relationship to his workforce: He was detached, aloof, inaccessible in every way.\n\nThe comparisons with Zucker were inevitable, and Licht hated them. Whereas the old boss was gregarious and warm, giving nicknames to employees and remembering their kids\u2019 birthdays, Licht came across as taciturn, seemingly going out of his way to avoid human relationships. At a holiday dinner for his D.C.-based talent, Licht went around the private room at Caf\u00e9 Milano, shook hands and spoke briefly with each of the journalists, then sat down and spent much of the dinner looking at his phone. Not only did he say nothing to address the group\u2014as they all expected he would\u2014but Licht barely interacted with the people seated near him. It became so awkward that guests began texting one another, wondering if there was some crisis unfolding with an international bureau. When a pair of them caught a glimpse of Licht\u2019s phone, they could see that he was reading a critical story about him in Puck.",

Leaks from inside his own house especially angered him. Licht knew that many people remained loyal to his predecessor; some of his top executives, as well as on-air personalities, spoke with Zucker regularly. That hadn\u2019t particularly bothered him at first. Over time, however, it became obvious that those conversations were finding their way into media stories scrutinizing his leadership of CNN. Licht told friends he was convinced that Zucker\u2014whose legacy he was undermining daily with rhetorical recriminations about past damage to CNN\u2019s brand\u2014was retaliating by pushing hit pieces on him. In particular, Licht felt certain that Zucker was using Puck\u2019s Dylan Byers, an ex-CNN employee who was pummeling Licht multiple times each week in his newsletter, to foment narratives of a mutiny at the network.\n\nLicht and Zucker knew each other, having worked together at NBCUniversal. Zucker told friends that he\u2019d found it unusual\u2014but hardly threatening\u2014when, a few years earlier, with buzz building around a potential WarnerMedia\u2013Discovery merger, Licht began attending David Zaslav\u2019s annual Labor Day party, an exclusive gathering in the Hamptons. Licht wasn\u2019t exactly the type of VIP who attended these events. When the merger began to appear inevitable, in the fall of 2021, Zucker got a call from Zaslav. He assured Zucker that his position atop CNN was secure. Then he asked his opinion of Licht. Zucker would later recall to friends that, at that moment, the endgame was clear. Within a few months, Zucker was out, Licht was in, and a cold war was under way. Attempts were made to broker a peace. In August 2022, Jay Sures, an agent who represents some of CNN\u2019s top talent, arranged a meeting at Zucker\u2019s vacation home. It was cordial enough, but suspicions ran deep between the two men. Both soon began peddling competing versions of what had gone down.\n\nHowever self-serving his criticisms of Zucker, Licht had legitimate reasons to be wary of his predecessor\u2019s approach. CNN had produced some terrific reporting during the Trump years, but it had also embarrassed itself, and the industry as a whole, on more than a few occasions. The use of paid contributors such as Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski, the latter of whom appeared on air while still being paid by the Trump campaign, served no defensible journalistic purpose. The incurious tone of the network\u2019s COVID-19 coverage\u2014its steady deference to government officials, paired with its derision toward those who held heterodox opinions on school closings and other restrictions\u2014did a disservice to viewers. All the while, Zucker\u2019s buddy-buddy rapport with the talent bred a lack of accountability that ultimately created rogues. Chris Cuomo smashed ethical norms and repeatedly lied to management about it. Jim Acosta routinely made himself the story while covering Trump\u2019s White House, specializing in lectures and snarky commentary instead of questions and source reporting. (One viral exchange with Trump, in which Acosta refused to surrender the microphone to a press aide, then stood to interrupt a colleague\u2019s question, came to epitomize the late stages of the Zucker era.) Licht had inherited a culture of loose rules and lax standards. For this, justifiably, he blamed Zucker.\n\nLicht could not, however, blame Zucker for what had become his biggest problem: Don Lemon.\n\nIn the middle of February, several weeks before I joined Licht for his morning workout, Lemon set social media ablaze\u2014and infuriated Harlow and Collins, his co-hosts\u2014by asserting that 51-year-old Nikki Haley \u201cisn\u2019t in her prime.\u201d A woman is only in her prime, Lemon explained, \u201cin her 20s, 30s, and maybe her 40s.\u201d This was just the latest in a string of offenses. For months, Lemon had been making the control room cringe with half-baked opinions, irritating Harlow and Collins by forcing his way into every segment, and angering Licht by adding the sort of superfluous commentary the boss had explicitly warned against. Tensions were already high when, one day in December, Collins started to interrupt Lemon during a news report. Lemon continued speaking and held up a finger to shush her\u2014\u201cstand by, one second,\u201d he said\u2014and then, after the segment, berated her in front of the crew. Their relationship would never recover. By the time Lemon made the \u201cprime\u201d remark, Licht was confronting the reality that his morning show might be a bust.\n\nScreenshot of CNN This Morning show when Dom Lemon was still one of the co-hosts\nCNN\nThere was no neat solution to the Lemon problem. Top executives urged Licht to fire him; Licht, knowing it would be seen as a response to the Haley episode, worried about setting a harsh precedent. Lemon pitched an attempt at damage control\u2014a prime-time special on misogyny, which he would host with a roundtable of women\u2014and Licht rejected it. Then, a staffer close to Licht told me, Lemon began telling allies that Al Sharpton, Ben Crump, and other Black leaders would rally to his defense if he were fired, making his dismissal a referendum on CNN\u2019s whiteness. (A spokesperson for Lemon denied this and accused Licht\u2019s team of spreading rumors about him to distract from Licht\u2019s failures at CNN.)",

His nature is that of a hard right guy in a tolerable exterior.  I described him that day as an axeman.  He cuts things.  He makes tv cheaper and more efficient and dumbed down.\n\nPeople were confused that he was somehow like a blood brother of Stephen Colbert.  Not so.  Not at all.  He rescued the production aspect of Colbert's show, and in that way, I say that Licht \"saved Colbert's life\", but in career sense only.\n\nLicht's skill sphere is around silly daytime talk panels.  \n\nWhat he's done at CNN was utterly predictable as it's a fusion of his strongly misguided politics and his experience create crappy daytime chat panels.\n\nAs many have come to realize, his dumb strategy is to try and attract the right wing which is by definition extreme, but in courting that cult, he has mortally damaged a lot of the credibility and purpose CNN once had.

His only goal is to appease David Zazlov and billionaire  John Malone who wants CNN to be more like Fox news.  Licht echoes  complaints mainly seen on reactionary outlets by guys like Shapiro, Kirk, and Walsh.\n\n\nDavid Zazlov is a right wing control freak who is insulated from any criticism, it's no wonder he had the Boston University president attack the graduates for booing him at their commencement.\n\nPoppy Harlow is as prejudiced and condescending  as she seems, dismissing Don Lemon's concerns about the dangerous backlash from MAGA supporters and how the network covered trump by bringing up \"The Boy who cried wolf\". \n\n\n\n\nTim Alberta calls the MSNBC coverage of the Fox Dominion verdict\" hysterical\" and insults the style of Nicole Wallace while ignoring CNN doing the same type of presentation.  In fact, Alberta uses the phrase \"hysterical\" twice belaying his background from so called neutral Politico.  Alberta gives multiple quotes from Licht's PERSONAL TRAINER, an MSNBC Rachel Maddow fan who honestly sounds more competent than most of the people interviewed.\n\nTL;DR:  It's a long article but worth reading to see why CNN is failing, they are definitely  pushing a right wing agenda trying to be Fox lite, but are too incompetent to understand most of the country isn't interested in what they are selling.",

If CNN is a megaphone its still on the American people to do the right thing at the ballot box and not put such a piece of shit in office.\n\nThat being said, its pretty clear what Trump is about at this point.  He doesnt have political stances, he has grievances.  Even then, if you want to give him a platform and try to have someone fact check him live, I can admire the desire to provide truth to his lies.  But to basically give Trump a free rally, and then add some election denying panelists while claiming youre just \"being centrist\"?  Nahhhhhhh fuck that.

The fact that they downplayed January 6. The fact he flat out said he wanted to appeal to Republicans and Moderates. The fact he reached out to Trump to get him on the air. They then make the news rather than report it by having him on their station. \n\nThere's not a single sign that CNN is has any interest in becoming AP or Reuters, i.e. true journalism.

I was tired of the skin deep coverage of anything and the six screeching heads at a time. Then when Trump came on the scene it became exhausting watching CNN. \n\nI already didn\u2019t care or like him, so hearing the same things over and over became exhausting. I still tuned in occasionally from 16-21 but it wasn\u2019t anything new or interesting, just the same \u201cit\u2019s the end of the world!\u201d. They became the same thing as everyone else. That\u2019s what convinced me to switch to printed news and foreign sources. DW, AJE, and France 24 became my international news, with the Hill and Meet The Press when I\u2019m trying to go national.\n\nI think CNN could be better, but they leaned too hard into cheap easy ratings with Trump outrage. It may have been skin deep but at least they used to be good at capturing the absolute latest developments abroad. Based on what I\u2019m reading in here they have no trust from conservatives, and are pissing off liberals, and now just have no viewers instead.",

            "comment": "Chris Licht conservative bent screwed his career up badly because he failed to realize that the majority of CNN viewers are center left which meant putting Trump up for more than a 30 minute interview ended up to be more a propaganda stunt that people saw was not only not entertaining, it felt insulting to most of the viewers.\nMr. Licht's staff warned him and many of CNN's long term employees probably gave him the same advice, but apparently he hasn't been listening for almost a year. If Chris Licht job was to sabotage the CNN news network, he did a rather good job dropping the ratings and losing personnel while he was captain of the ship. That's no way to run a business, but that also explicitly puts in stark light that being conservative and attempting to put those interests ahead of the people that backed CNN in viewership is committing suicide. You can't push your own personal agenda or the hidden ones that management wants that are in direct conflict with the viewership, advertisers, and especially Wall Street, and expect that you won't get push back that not only can make you lose your job, but also the sinking of the company.\n\nIn the end, the staff and much of the people at CNN decided not to support him behind the scenes, because it was never in their interest to keep him employed there. They intuitively knew that if he stayed, the chances of other people sacrificed with termination would be the scape goats to this guys stupidity, because that's often how authoritarian management stays in power. The question becomes are his friends going to pushing him down, up, or place him in another business?\n\nHow did he fuck up? Instead of using the business perspective of let's produce material that we used in the past that works and makes us money. Why don't we make new stuff up that has the potential for conservatives to like? The guy already has data and research notes of what programming brings more viewers and gets advertisers to give more money, yet he gambles on attempting to modify the staff (terminations) to push political controversy into the work place yet he states he wants a balanced approach to news? \n\nThe best approach to news is to tell the truth, provide verified checks on any matters if possible, and report objectively about everything. The stupidity about the former CEO was that he fails to understand that political parties lie all the time about everything, which means a lot of any political parties platform on any issue can be extremely untrue in almost every sense, so, to avoid favoritism, you don't emphasize any parties statements unless you believe they are true. This is why CNN does not report much of the Republican Party's platform, because the personal beliefs and professional research of their employees have not found for many of their (conservative) statements cannot be verified to be true. The worst part of the conservative approach is that not only CNN cannot provide verified support, but that most of the Republican party supporters have not provided evidential matters to support many of their 'issues' which is why so many 'verifying' reviewers have been needed to find and weed out garbage data points. Conservatives seem to blame everyone about things that are different from their perspective, but they should already know why many industries, sciences, and professions are inherently going to skew center left, since, a lot of conservative groups want to alter and eliminate those parts of the economy they don't like, so, what do you expect? Do you think its any different from the extreme left? Hell no. Those people are just as uncompromising, because they can't see the landscape of the economy, business, and social interaction.",

Much of it can be attributed simply to CNN being the first 24-hour news network. The round the clock coverage of the first Gulf War was novel for the time. They quickly devolved into milking whatever the current 'crisis' was until the next thing came along.\n\nSecond, I think they overestimated how many people actually want serious journalism from a reputable source, at least from a cable TV network. It seems cable audiences are much more interested in heavily partisan and bias programming.\n\nFinally, even if there was demand, producing high-quality, serious journalism is neither quick nor easy. Obtaining the necessary expertise and staffing to fill an entire 24 hours each and every day is unlikely to be financially viable. These networks have adopted the model of a talking head spouting their barely informed opinions because it is much more cost-effective and brings in consistent views from viewers that like or connect with the host.",

I think many recent shows would lend well to the \"2 hour episode,\" including many that are really no longer being made. I'd love to see The Big Bang Theory cast maybe get together for a trip to Japan or the cast of Hawaii 5-0 gets drawn back together to solve a big case.\n\nWhat shows would you like to see this do do this?",

It seems like they're starting to do these now. Or at least... NBC Universal is because that's the common denominator between these three properties (Community is produced by Sony but aired most of its run on NBC and the movie is going to Peacock).",

It was as if the late night programmers were as high as the viewing audience. at least these blocks would include Girls Gone Wild ads so the trade off was worth it",

According to her, it was around the 60s or 70s who they started showing features (theatrical movies) on TV, mostly on weekend nights. Then a couple of the networks began to make 1 1/2 hr movies for TV and a couple of them were pilots for series like Columbo, 6 Million Dollar Man, etc.    Then around the late 70s they began making the \"novel for television\" - optioning novels for a big budget miniseries - Shogun, The Thornbirds, Holocaust.  This was all before cable took off and way before streaming or premium channels,\n\n  A lot of TV shows started doing an extended episode - sitcoms would do a 1 hr show, dramas would do a feature length movie, either for TV (usually the series finale)  or for a theatrical release (Sex and the City, Twin Peaks, etc)",

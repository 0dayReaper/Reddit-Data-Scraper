But Jimmy was a scam artist through and through no matter what happened. Before Chuck, Slippin Jimmy was there at the start of the series when the relationship was good. Slippin Jimmy was around before Chuck had any ability over Jimmy, when they were kids. Jimmy was always a con artist. That started before Chuck started fucking with Jimmy.\n\nEven before Jimmy is aware of Chuck's machinations, he spends most of the first season running scams. The skateboarders, the billboard, taking the bribe from the Kettlemans. Jimmy is always a con artist with flexible moral values. Chuck didn't create that, he just made it worse when he blew up their relationship, the only real guardrails Jimmy ever had.",

He's also not a complete monster, who could have been shown more compassion and understanding.\n\nChuck was snobby and judgemental, even underhanded, but also dedicated and struggling with mental illness.\n\nA rewatch of the series definitely took the wool off my eyes towards how \"innocent\" jimmy was, knowing full well where the story was going - his sleaziness is a lot more present than I remembered - but it also painted a more complex and tragic picture of him. A guy struggling with an addiction and compulsion, something that afflicts a lot of the series' characters. Doing the \"right thing\" / being honest never actually serves him in any rewarding manner - exemplified from the season 1 finale all the way through to the series finale, where finally piecing his soul together and being emotionally true to himself gets his meagre sentencing bumped up considerably. But he seems at peace with that.\n\nThe last scene between the two brothers, in the finale, is important.  I believe it is inferred to be Jimmy's actual \"regret\" - that he didn't take the time to talk with Chuck when interest was shown from the latter towards his 'lesser' of clientele - and that speaks to Jimmy's acknowledgment that he could have indeed tried harder to introspect and open himself up. He had a chance to help his brotherly relationship flourish, too.",

Chuck\u2019s behaviour certainly didn\u2019t help things, but we see time and time again in the show that Jimmy has had countless opportunities to turn things around, even without Chuck\u2019s involvement, and he squandered all of them - sometimes on purpose. \n\nIt\u2019s simply not a case of Chuck needing to try to make amends, the two of them were both so unwilling to change that they were never going to see eye to eye.",

Jimmy sacrificed and went out of his way to cater to Chuck and his delusions all in the service of being a good brother to a person he loved and admired, despite not seeing eye to eye. Sentiments that Chuck was never going to return because he saw himself as superior to Jimmy, despite being an absolute frothing kook.\n\nThe acceptance only went one way in their relationship, and I found it to be heartbreaking.",

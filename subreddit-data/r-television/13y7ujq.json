Comedy in the UK already has a culture of panel shows, which means any up and coming comedian there is frequently going to be put in a more collaborative environment and learn how to play off other comedians and not constantly demand to be the center of attention. \n\nMeanwhile, in America, comedians often go one of two ways:  Either they do stand-up which is more solitary and competitive, or they do something like improv or sketch comedy which requires working with others.  The problem is these shows almost always cast the former, which means you end up with a panel of people constantly trying to one-up each other and being competitive, which doesn't work quite as well as if you had comedians who were used to sharing the stage.",

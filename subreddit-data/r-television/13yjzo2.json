It just seems like Sam Levinson and The Weeknd\u2019s opportunity to have their creepy sex fantasies displayed on screen, disguised as a \u201ccautionary tale,\u201d or whatever they claim their actual intent for the show is. Also, the show seems like a pretty miserable viewing experience. Torture porn with a shallow script isn\u2019t really up my alley.",

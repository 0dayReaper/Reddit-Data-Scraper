They have already struck fifteen bases along the Cardassian border. So, this is a huge victory for the good guys. \nThis may even be the turning point of the entire war. There's even a 'Welcome to the Fight' party tonight in the wardroom. \n\nSo I lied, I cheated, I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men. I am an accessory to murder. \n\nBut most damning thing of all, I think I can live with it. And if I had to do it all over again, I would. \n\nGarak was right about one thing. \n\nA guilty conscience is a small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant, so I will learn to live with it. \n\nBecause I can live with it. \n\nI can live with it. \n\nComputer\u2026\n\n\nerase that entire personal log.",

And you'll get what you wanted: a war between the Romulans and the Dominion. And if your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved the entire Alpha Quadrant, and all it cost was the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal\u2026 and the self-respect of one Starfleet officer. I don't know about you, but I'd call that a bargain.\"",

A wave can be compared with other waves, and we can call it more or less beautiful, higher or lower, longer lasting or less long lasting. But if we look more deeply, we see that a wave is made of water. While living the life of a wave, the wave also lives the life of water. It would be sad if the wave did not know that it is water. It would think, 'Some day I will have to die. This period of time is my life span, and when I arrive at the shore, I will return to nonbeing.'\n&gt; \n&gt; These notions will cause the wave fear and anguish. A wave can be recognized by signs -- beginning or ending, high or low, beautiful or ugly. In the world of the wave, the world of relative truth, the wave feels happy as she swells, and she feels sad as she falls. She may think, 'I am high!' or 'I am low!' and develop superiority or inferiority complexes, but in the world of the water there are no signs, and when the wave touches her true nature -- which is water -- all of her complexes will cease, and she will transcend birth and death,\" \n\n- Thich Nhat Hanh, *The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching: Transforming Suffering into Peace, Joy, and Liberation*. New York: Broadway Books, 1999, pp. 124-125.\n\nThe music playing during that scene is Arvo Part's [Spiegel im Spiegel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6Mzvh3XCc) (Mirrors in Mirrors).",

The whole speech is a quite bit longer than this;\n\n&gt;Enough to the crime; which every day chokes more and more of the life from our city. And the thing of it is; if we don't take responsibility and step up, not just for the mistakes and the miscues, but for whether or not we're going to win this battle for our streets... if that doesn't happen, we're going to lose these neighborhoods, and ultimately this city forever. If we don't have the courage and the conviction to fight this war the way it should be fought; the way it needs to be fought using every weapon we can possibly muster... if that doesn't happen? Then we're staring at defeat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And that defeat should not, and cannot, and will not be forgiven.\n\nIt's absolutely remarkable writing; because it goes against everything that *The Wire* has tried to show about the suffering and futility of an ever-escalating War on Drugs. Carcetti himself doesn't really believe what he's saying; he's just using a tough-on-crime campaign to attack his opponent.\n\nAnd yet the rhetoric and performance is so rousing that even though we should know better... it's easy for the viewer to be fooled into thinking, \"Yes, this is the man who will finally clean up the streets!\"",

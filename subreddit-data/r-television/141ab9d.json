    "postText": "Maybe related: [Being told the Genre of a movie may be a Spoiler.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jxp6en/being_told_the_genre_of_a_movie_may_be_a_spoiler/)\n\n- So I guess like ... 'Being told how good / bad a movie is or an actor's portrayal of a character is may be a Spoiler' ?\n\n\\---\n\nI'm so intrigued by this notion like that episode of The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody S02E09 [Books &amp; Birdhouses](https://suitelife.fandom.com/wiki/Books_%26_Birdhouses)\n\n&gt;If it's a birdhouse, it gets an \"f.\" If it's a wheelbarrow, it's a \"c.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 - **For acting**: Consider an episode or a season of a mystery TV series or some installment of a mystery movie franchise where people theorise that a certain character is a mystery murderer and then apparently this would explain why the actor of that character did not act so well when the character was supposed to be crying at the funeral or something. In this case, if the character turns out to be the surprise villain in the next episode, season or movie sequel, then the actor was actually good.\n\n* **Question 1: Is it possible to evaluate acting this way - like a certain portrayal is good or bad conditioned on what might or actually does happen later on?**\n* I'm asking mostly because of something I've actually seen. I had a theory about something and then I looked it up. And then other people had this theory and then someone said in comments 'Oh then that means this actor was not acting badly in this scene.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 - **For writing:** Consider an episode or a season of a fantasy / scifi TV series or some installment of a fantasy / scifi movie franchise where a certain villain/s unexpectedly dies / die so suddenly. And then 'That's it?' You might give a low review. But if the villain/s turn out to be actually alive, then you might have to adjust your review ex post facto.\n\n* **Question 2: Is it possible to evaluate writing this way - like a certain storyline is good or bad conditioned on what - might or actually does happen later on?** Darth Jar Jar in Star Wars might be a good example. I think also some episodes of the later Game of Thrones seasons.\n* **Guess for movies**: Well, maybe in movies it's justified to rate a movie w/o considering future installments. I'm not so sure in TV series though. You say it's a this is justified because at the end of the movie you should actually see a hint or something. And it's not like people are going to really hold off a rating until the sequel is out. **But is it possible theoretically even if practically 'Hey too bad, we have to give a rating for the current installment' ?**\n* **Guess for TV series**: I'm asking mostly because I found apparently in TV series it's not necessarily that a season is rated as a whole but that a season's rating is the average (weighted average maybe if some episodes are longer?) of the rating of each of its episodes. So like a villain could unexpectedly die in episode 3 but then turn out alive in episode 6. **But oh too late we evaluated our thing already for episode 3 ... ? Or maybe it's like the movies case where they do have to show a hint at the end of the episode?**",

I can't think of any specific examples, but I watch a lot of genre TV and some of it has dragged on too long (The Walking Dead shows, some of the Beeboverse).  I've noticed characters being written poorly or acting in a way that doesn't fit their character.  I'll complain about the characters acting illogically, and sometimes it's for a twist like you're talking about.  But the writing has declined so that there's more examples of them acting illogically for no reason.",

Lol so people could rate the episode bad because it's a bad &gt;!conclusion of a!&lt; storyline but then the storyline &gt;!needn't actually be concluded!&lt; because the season isn't over yet. Of course the storyline&gt;!'s ending!&lt; is confirmed to be bad once the season is over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be clear I'm talking about this Game of Thrones storyline:\n\nThe &gt;!end of the long night / white walkers / zombies / etc!&lt; \\- like S0&gt;!8!&lt;E&gt;!03!&lt; was rated bad &gt;!because it's an abrupt end of the storyline and people even thought like it's just the beginning and that the rest of the season was going to focus on all these!&lt;. After the season is over, yes the episode is bad. But I think they have to really wait until the end of season. Idk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3\n\nas for the society\n\nWell I like it but you may be frustrated it's not over if you watch it. lol.\n\nThe bottom line is that actor X = &gt;!Kathryn Newton!&lt; is a bad actor apparently unless X's character is actually a secret villain or something. and it's not revealed in s1 unlike in the case of citadel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo cursory look - you think it's possible people can evaluate that X's performance this way just as people evaluated Richard Madden's accent similarly?",

One former student stated that Franco \"would always make everybody think there were possible roles on the table if we were to perform sexual acts or take off our shirts\" in his projects. Another alleged that Franco held a sex scenes class and removed students' vaginal guards while simulating oral sex with them. Franco's attorney, Michael Plonsker, disputed the allegations.\\[174\\]\n\nOn October 3, 2019, two former students of Franco's now-closed film and acting school, Studio 4, filed a lawsuit against him and his partners. According to The New York Times, the complaint alleged that the program \"was little more than a scheme to provide him and his male collaborators with a pool of young female performers that they could take advantage of.\" The case claimed that pupils were subjected to \"sexually exploitative auditions and film shoots\" and had to sign away their rights to the recordings.\\[176\\] The litigants sought unspecified monetary damages as well as the return or destruction of any questionable material. Franco has denied the plaintiffs' claims through his attorney.\\[177\\]\n\nOn December 23, 2021, Franco admitted to having had sex with students and to being in treatment for sexual addiction since 2016; however, he did not address other forms of sexual exploitation.\\[93\\]\\[186\\]",

I\u2019d be like, \u2018He\u2019s in his zone right now.'\u201d \n\n\u201cthe vibe on set was quite lighthearted,\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re all really good friends and we all are similar people and really understand each other. We were having a lot of laughs, listening to a lot of music, dancing around, and that kind of energy is what made the heavier moments easier and possible.\u201d\n\n**The Weeknd:**\n\n \u201cI had to take off the Weeknd outfit, put on Tedros\u2019s wig, shoot with Jocelyn, then go back to being the Weeknd,\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was tough to go from one head to another. Then, after the concert, I lost my voice. No voice came out at all. That\u2019s never happened before.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy theory is that I forgot how to sing because I was playing Tedros, a character who doesn\u2019t know how to sing,\u201d \n\n\u201cI may be looking too deeply into this, but it was terrifying. As the Weeknd, I\u2019ve never skipped a concert. I\u2019ve performed with the flu. I\u2019ll die on that stage. But there was something very complicated going on with my mind at that moment.\u201d",

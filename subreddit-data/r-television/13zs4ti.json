    "postText": "I recently came across a show on Amazon Prime, originally aired in Australia about ten or fifteen years ago, following the crew of an Australian Navy patrol vessel, the HMAS Hammersley, as they fight pirates, smugglers, terrorists, and other bad people. If you're a fan of Horatio Hornblower type stories, you might enjoy this show: dangerous situations, limited resources ... cool ass boat.\r  \n\r  \nBecause the ship itself is so small (crew of 20 or so), there's almost no need for crew beyond the regular cast. Commanding Officer \"Boss\"; Executive Officer \"X\"; Navigator \"Nav\"; senior enlisted man \"Buffer\"; senior engineering petty officer \"Change\"; ship's cook \"Chefo\"; random new jack-of-all-trades sailor \"Spider\" (because his last name is Webb); Boatswain, who's a combination medic, gun-expert, and pilot \"Swain\"; Radio Operation \"RO\"; and Electronic Technician \"ET\". There are cast changes from season to season. 3 to 4 is probably the toughest as Buffer, Spider, ET, and Nav all leave, and I'm not quite sold on their replacements (plus, can someone explain to me why \"2Dads\" has that as his nickname because I don't think he actually HAS two dads).\r  \n\r  \nThe biggest issues in the early seasons are that often times the bad guys only seem able to achieve their goals because of poor decision making made by the regular cast. I mean, this is hardly a terribly damaging charge -- most of Star Trek TNG's S1 episodes are similar. But it gets to a point where the Hammersley is leaving a two-man \"steaming crew\" on a ship because they've got to run off to respond to a distress call and I just know the episode is going to become about trying to rescue the steaming crew. One terrible variation on this features an lunatic running around a yacht with an axe. If you see this episode and don't roll your eyes at the ending, you're a considerably more patient man than me. Glad I stuck with it past this episode because the last episodes of the season were quite strong.\r  \n\r  \nA fun nitpick: in the 70s, there was a similar Australian tv program called \"Patrol Boat.\" Same setup: fictional stories about the Australian Navy fighting smugglers, pirates, etc., filmed aboard actual HMAS patrol ships. The two shows are, as far as I can determine, unrelated except in concept and execution.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the things I find most interesting about Sea Patrol is that post season 1, the ship is portrayed by actual HMAS Armadale-Class warships (in S1 it's a different HMAS class which is retired at the end of the season), and I was able to find pretty great deckplans of the ship, allowing me to compare the map I imagined watching the show to the actual deckplan.\n\nS4E5 - \"Paradise Lost\" is, I swear to God, a Star Trek script.",

Death, dismemberment, etc.\n\n &gt;!It was a pretty strong ending -- RIP, Swain :( -- but there were some plot elements over the course of the season that I didn't understand. The show was certainly at a loss for the departure of Bomber after S4. One big change in S5 is that extras are more commonly seen, including women (I don't think we've seen women extras on the Hammersley prior to S5). I think one of the extras in S5E1 even had officers bars, but then is never seen again. At the end of the final episode, they do little updates on what happen to the crew. The way they treated Lt. McGregor -- \"She marries Mike Flynn and has babies\" -- is a frankly pretty disappointing way to end the show. IMO, after Swain's funeral, Flynn should've accepted promotion to NAVCOMM, and told McGregor she was being promoted and would replace him as CO. Also disappointed to learn the show was canceled because it was losing tax credits. I found a 60 Minutes Australia video on YouTube about Lisa McCune. I had thought the entirety of the show was filmed on Armadale-Class ships, but apparently a lot of soundstages -- including of the bridge -- were constructed, which makes a lot of sense. I do wonder if they built a full stage for S1 when they were on a different class vessel. !&lt;",

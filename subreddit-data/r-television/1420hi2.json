Upon arrival, the contestants are told that the sixteen contestants were to romantically pursue each other. The announcement is a surprise to the contestants; one contestant, April, stated that she thought her son would be on a separate retreat instead of in her dating pool.\u00a0The contestants perform challenges. In the first episode, the blindfolded women have to identify their son by feeling the men's shirtless torsos, and the winner of the challenge receives a night in one of the suites with a hot tub.\u00a0Each mother-son pair shares a room. In the second episode, the contestants guess each other's deepest sex secrets, and one of the women reveal that she has had sex with her son's best friend. The fourth episode introduces elimination to the program, as one mother-son duo is kicked off, and the fifth episode introduces a new mother-son duo (Lisa/Ryan S) to take their place.\n\nThis sounds like a masterpiece",

I\u2019m proud of all of you who voted as well as those who were vocally supportive, even if unable to vote. Everyone played a part in this achievement. Together we lock elbows and in unity we build a new contract that honors our contributions in this remarkable industry, reflects the new digital and streaming business model and brings ALL our concerns for protections and benefits into the now! Bravo SAG-AFTRA, we are in it to win it.\u201d",

If you make millions, you can afford a lot but most actors are basically hopping from job to job and looking for some basic life needs.  Makes sense a union handles that demand.",

It's usually someone who has a history of working in the field that the union represents, who mainly acts as the \"face\" of the union but isn't really involved in much actual decision making. The real head of the union is the executive director, who is most often a career labor organizer.",

Meanwhile, my wife's pension is only paid into by the company and can be taken away at any point, for any reason (or no reason).\n\nUnionize your workplace. There's literally no downside unless you're the employer that's trying to screw their workers. We really need some class solidarity in this country, and while the push for unions in some positions over the past few years are encouraging, we need more.",

Lots of benefits I'd never experienced working for a restaurant before; hour paid break, free meal, the cooks make $25/hr, food runner $17.50 + tip share, server $15 hr + tips obv.  Fully vested pension after 5 years, free healthcare if working enough hours (which I've learned is a bitch to get because they all hire pretty much everyone part time only, but the union provides it's own healthcare and has it's own medical center, so you can use hours from 2 union part time jobs to reach your hour requirement). \n\n\n\n\nJust saw some union literature today around the break room that city wide negotiations are currently happening though and the big focus is on increased pay and decreased workload by requiring more staff (since the hospitality industry has been big on running light to up profitability).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: this thread got me inspired to do more deep digging on the Culinary Union and go through their youtube channel, every bit of info I could find on the website, etc.  They do even more than I imagined, they're behind a lot of the more progressive bills.  They're behind a bill to ban institutional landlords in Las Vegas and cap rent increases at 5%.  I'm pretty fucking proud of them.  The existence of blue collared republicans/anti-union just blows my mind, they're actively doing so much to improve the living conditions for all non-capital owners.  If you own capital and make all your money passively then yeah it's fair for you to hate unions.  But for the other 98% of us....why?  It's literally our only hope since every other avenue has failed.",

Some I think we're just hoping to be offered a package to leave and with their years the package would have been substantial. I felt at that point those people were taking away job opportunities from younger generations and affecting the quality of work of the company negatively. Without a union you are open to be abused by your employer and with a union it can teeter the other way and lead to stagnation in productivity. It'll all depend on the people on both sides. \n\nI had a friend at another company that had a union, he was a new grad wanted to show he was capable and wouldn't mind staying 10-15 mins longer end of day to wrap something up, his older co workers noticed and started coming over and turning off his monitor while he was still working to let him know day is done and that's not how we do things here.",

What will end up happening is that we get get paid OT slightly earlier. We\u2019ll still be working insanely and ungodly long hours until the guild fights for actual change.\n\nOh and 5% raise for this year with diminished raises the following two years is pathetic",

                    "comment": "Generally - but not always! - an actor is listed as an EP because them signing on to the project entices more investors with money to come on. Giving an actor with a big name an EP credit allows the actor to collect more money and be eligible for more awards, but their producer duties are minimal, if any.\n\nOn the WGA side, the loose rule is \"if you are a writer/producer, you can keep doing your producer duties but not your writing duties,\" and the studios have really tried to enforce that. With writers, it's tricky, because most of the producer things ARE writing. If you're in an edit bay and you decide to cut dialogue or rearrange scenes, that's writing (it's like rearranging or cutting in a script). If you're approving wardrobe, that's writing (it's like adding \"JENNY wears a sweater to hide her insecurities\" to a script). If you're pitching a project to studios or financiers, that's writing (literally, you're coming up with words on the fly). So those situations can be difficult. If you're a showrunner doing something like approving time cards for stuff already shot, that would pretty much be fine (although the WGA is encouraging showrunners to literally not do any work at all and gum up the process as much as possible - but they can't enforce this on any non-writing duties). \n\nActors run into this problem less frequently - but again, that's not ALWAYS true. One example might be doing talk show interviews to promote your new project - that is technically PERFORMING in front of people in service of this project, even if it's not acting, per se. To the extent that acting is about making performance choices, an actor with a lot of creative control like Tom Cruise could arguably not get to have editing input, since deciding which of his takes he likes better COULD be considered under the acting umbrella (I think this is unlikely but not impossible).\n\nUltimately, there's a lot of grey area, but probably anything an actor does in front of an audience - whether that's a literal audience or simply one exec hearing a pitch - is not kosher. But if, for some reason, that actor is also in charge of like.... booking the catering trucks, that would be fine.",

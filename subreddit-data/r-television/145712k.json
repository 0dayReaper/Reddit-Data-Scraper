I can leave home WiFi, and my phone works for 30 days. I can also use \u201cmove my home WiFi\u201d 4 times in a twelve month rolling period. So if I travel, I can change my home WiFi twice, once at the destination, and again when I get home. So with Hulu my phone works for 30 days, and I can temporarily update my home WiFi twice in a twelve month period.",

Netflix's streaming service is the entire company whereas Amazon's is a small part of it so they'll operate in completely different ways, like Prime Video is used as a perk to lure people into buying more Amazon products rather than relying fully on the number of subscriptions, and so being the one company that allows password sharing is probably going to be much more profitable for Amazon than cracking down on it",

The one attached to your credit card and the rest of the store? I know it's not too big a risk if you let people you trust use it, but it's still a really iffy situation.\n\nI let others borrow my Netflix and Disney Plus, because they can only use the service and do nothing else. I'd never let them borrow my Prime.",

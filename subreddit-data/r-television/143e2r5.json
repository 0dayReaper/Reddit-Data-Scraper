If you really paid attention and rewatched the episodes a few times you could figure it out within the first few episodes. Then they dropped a few more hints with each episode until the final reveal.  It wasn't super obvious, nor was it super out of nowhere.  A casual viewer might pick up on a couple of the clues but probably wouldn't be able to figure it out until the last episode or two.\n\nIf they make it more difficult than that, it will enter \"out of nowhere\" territory that really turns me off from some who-dun-its.  The vast majority of viewers will be watching it casually and not participating in the reddit where people can share clues and easily link them together. It would be a huge mistake to cater to the minority of hardcore viewers over the enjoyment of the more casual viewers.",

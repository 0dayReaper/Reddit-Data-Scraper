Lol. \n\nBut it it\u2019s not like a flasher thing where someone is getting off on being naked in front of people without consent, and it\u2019s not a sexual thing, I don\u2019t see an issue. \n\nThe other time spoken about someone walked in on him naked in his own room/trailer for job they are paid to be nude at, and I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s an issue. \n\nI mean we don\u2019t even blink at people method acting. It would be perfectly reasonable that he\u2019s trying to be comfortable being nude in his trailer.",

One day in June we get the ok to switch and there's a line for the bathroom, like 3 deep. I thought I was being clever by going into the closet with the mop bucket and chemicals and whatnot and changing in there. I change quick, no big deal and exit the closet.\n\nOne of my managers is in the breakroom (closet was in there) and he sees me holding my pants and says \"Dude, did you just change in there?\". I'm like, yeah I figured it was private enough. He bursts out laughing and says \"you didn't look up and see the cameras, eh?\"\n\nNo. No I did not.",

Speer told the newspaper he hid himself behind the wardrobe and thought no more about it** until, six days later, **he was told there had been a couple of complaints \u2013 referring to this incident and another, when he\u2019d walked naked past his open trailer door.**\n\n&gt; Speer reports that **he was kept away from set while the company investigated and then told his contract had been terminated on the production. His character was then written out for the rest of the series.**\n\n\n\n**Speer\u2019s Response**\n\n&gt; Speer, who\u2019s not worked since, told the Daily Mail: \u201c**It was tragi-comic, but they didn\u2019t realise how badly affected I was. I went into massive, deep shock. As you can see, I\u2019m still kind of there.**\n\n&gt; **\u201cThey\u2019ve taken my job. They\u2019ve taken my reputation. They\u2019ve taken my money. They\u2019ve taken my mental health.\u201d**\n\n\n\n**Disney\u2019s Comment**\n\n&gt; A spokesperson for Disney told the Mail: \u201c**Last year, we were made aware of allegations of inappropriate conduct by Hugo Speer on the set of The Full Monty. As is policy, an independent investigation was launched. Upon its completion, the decision was made to terminate his contract, with immediate effect.**\u201d",

He knew this. So if he was walking around in his trailer, balls out with an open door (in an area shared with other trailers and crew, mind you), then he was being a pervert and deserved to get fired.\n\nTrailers aren't equivalent to being at home.

That being said I also really don't want him to do it because I don't want to see a single cent from the effects go to stunt casting. This show is going to need an insane budget to pull off all the bending properly without it looking ridiculous.\n\nIn a perfect world I'd have the rock just be such a huge fan of the show that he does it for cheap just because he wants to be involved.",

All the praise is peaking my curiosity.\n\nEdit: Wow, a lot of passion for this show from a number of folks who share some of my tastes it seems. Well, guess I have to watch it now! Thanks so much for the feedback everyone.\n\nUpdate 6/1/20: Watched the first season and really enjoyed it! I can see why the show is held in such high regard, especially by people who grew up with it. The lessons it teaches, the endearing characters, the occasionally corny but pretty adorable humor all add up to make an unexpectedly good show. I plan on continuing the series, I\u2019ll toss an update up here once I finish book 3 if anyone is interested.\n\nUpdate 6/11/20: Yup, definitely barreled through the rest of the show. Wow, have to say I\u2019m blown away at the quality and content of what I thought was a \u201ckid show.\u201d I highly recommend anyone who is in the fence to dive in, it was awesome! \n\nWhat\u2019s next? Comics? Legend of Korra?",

The fight sequences are great (creative, surprising, exciting...) and it's art direction looks beautiful.\n\nIt is still a kids show, so it does occasionally have some kiddish humor and kiddish episodes, but what is really impressive about Avatar is that it doesn\u2019t shy away from dark themes or concepts: genocide, loss of a parent/child, racism, sexism, authoritarianism, censorship... it approaches them all very honestly and doesn\u2019t pretend the world is rosy.\n\nIf that sounds interesting, then I\u2019d recommend it.\n\nEDIT: since this has blown up a bit I figured I'd fix the typos haha",

Along with the experiences he had in between giving the song\u2019s connection to his grief even more meaning. He could give great advice and help all these people in ba sing se, but he wasn\u2019t able to help his own son. Despite that grief, he maintains his kind and generous persona throughout the show. \n\nPart of why that scene is so powerful is because it\u2019s one of just a few scenes in the entire show you see iroh in emotional pain. To see a character who you\u2019ve come to know as a beacon of positivity break down like that is rough. Then the backstory of iroh\u2019s voice actor mako...all so sad.\n\nI love ATLA",

But as early as the first few episodes, we start hearing other Fire Nation soldiers refer to Iroh with great reverence, and begin to see glimpses of his incredible power. We start realizing there's more to this guy.\n\nFilling in all the pieces makes Iroh and his relationship with Zuko feel unbelievably real.",

I can't remember the exact words, but it sounded like it would be a while if another series would ever come. That was over five years ago now though, and with the original series getting this boost in popularity along with the live-action remake down the line, it's easy to be optimistic about more new content.",

Instead Iroh pulls him in for a hug and lets him know he was never angry, only sad because he though Zuko had lost his way. \n\nAll the buildup from the first episodes where Zuko would belittle Iroh through the second season where Zuko starts to see Iroh as a father figure only to turn on him and finally in the third season realizing how much better of a man Iroh is than Ozai really makes this scene amazing.",

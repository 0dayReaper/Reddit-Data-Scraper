The only streaming service I sub through the entire year is Netflix mostly because of the amount of content like docu series which I personally enjoy. But I am thinking of dropping Netflix over Apple as my main following this year because Apple has genuinely been hitting home runs recently. Spending way more time with Apple content than Netflix.\n\nRest of the streaming services I only sub when my favorites are on. For example Disney+ during The Mandalorian, they could be putting out some other amazing shows the rest of the year but I don\u2019t fully trust in their quality enough to justify wasting money staying subbed months on end. Subscribe when your favorites are on like The Bear, binge through their entire catalog from the list you made while being subbed for The Bear\u2019s run.",

Definitely cancelling Hulu after I finish \"The Bear\" and \"The Great\"\n\nThanks for reminding me I need to cancel Disney+ after Mandalorian!",

It's probably why *The Class of '09* got made for FX on Hulu. :D\n\nHis BBC2 drama, [*London Spy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1PEQkpKTLI) is [up on Roku](https://therokuchannel.roku.com/details/80e0898ac8c35aad970d9d3993966b17/if-this-is-a-lie?source=bing) if you can deal with ads.\n\nBut [*MotherFatherSon*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn87RhvtG5Y) left Starz long long ago, and I believe it's only around for purchase on streaming.",

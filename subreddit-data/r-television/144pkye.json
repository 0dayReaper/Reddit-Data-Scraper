The Shows follows Bus Driver, Ralph Kransden (Played by Jackie Gleason) his Wife Alice, (Played by Audrey Meadows), His Best Friend, Ed Norton (Played by Art Carney), and his Wife, Trixie (Played by Joyce Randolph)\n\nDo you think the show is worth watching?\n\nAlso, when I look up The Honeymooners, It mention that the show had Lost Episodes? Can someone explain what the Lost Episodes are?",

            "comment": "The Lost Episodes are sketches from The Jackie Gleason Show, which is where the show originated.\n\nFrom 1951 through June of 1955, and again from October of 1956 through June 1957, The Honeymooners was a sketch on the show. Sometimes, it took up the entire show,  TBH.\n\nThe show titled \"The Honeymooners\" was a single season,  39 episodes, that aired in 1955 and 1956. It was originally contracted for two seasons, but stiff competition, lower than hoped ratings, climbing budget, and a restrictive half hour format led Gleason to end the show early and fold the sketch back into his variety show.\n\nThe Lost Episodes are those sketches that surround the Classic 39. In the 80s, when nostalgia for the show was probably at its peak, Gleason bundled the sketches together for syndication as \"The Lost Episodes\", and that's what they've been called since. The majority of them still exist, but some, especially the ones from the DuMont days, are lost. There's a box set with all the existing ones, and they're likely streaming as well.",

As with all sitcoms though, it certainly depends on your sense of humor.\n\nI'm typing from memory on the lost episodes, but I believe there are DVD collections of the \"lost episodes\" which have since been \"found.\" Whether all of them are available or not, I don't know offhand. Some of them had to have audio redubbed. Somebody else could probably explain this in greater detail.",

Back then it could be due to the film tape being destroyed, usually by fire as they were pretty flammable and delicate.

I know it happened a lot in 1&amp;2 but it just felt really prevalent in S3 for whatever reason. And it's not really the yelling itself, but that it's just entirely unneeded and largely unearned within the sketches. It just gets old to me.\n\nEdit: Someone mentioned in another thread Tim doing \"the voice\" which I also really agree with and was including under the umbrella of yelling. Pay it forward? Hysterical, but hated the yelling. Crooner? Hysterical, but hated the yelling/voice. Just two examples, but it felt way overdone.",

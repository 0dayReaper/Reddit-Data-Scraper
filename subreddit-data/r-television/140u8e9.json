This is one of the key reasons actors are usually forbidden to see dailies of their acting while they are working on said project: seeing themselves on screen has too strong of a psychological impact, and it messes up how they see themselves. \n\nIn acting courses where you are filmed on camera, this is a common topic and problem for noobs as well. I\u2019ve seen a few people who always want to see themselves on camera, but imho about half of these people were terrible actors with an obsession of their self image. It felt like when they were acting, they were trying to appear like a beautiful model at all times. I am including both genders in that statement.",

I guess my question would be how do bad actors improve, then?\n\nI\u2019m a sports guy, and if you\u2019re playing poorly you generally want to watch your game film to identify the weaknesses in your game and then try to fix them in training. \n\nRefusing to watch your own performances and relying on notes from outsiders just sounds so strange from an \u201cimprove your craft\u201d perspective to me.",

On stage acting experience counts. Some talent, some self-awareness, some hand holding, and way more experience than the competition gives you an absurd advantage over competing amateurs. \n\nI think bad guidance can destroy young acting talent though. I don\u2019t want to name names but some great young actors in just the last decade have worked with hack after hack on various projects and their enormous talent disappears and they become far more stilted. If you work with hacks, take advice from hacks, it\u2019s going to rub off while you are still impressionable. Someone like Leonardo DiCaprio would have been the same, if he didn\u2019t have both the good fortune and the self awareness to go after deeper projects with good artists at the right age.",

His costars, the show runner all speak highly of him, they said he was professional &amp; in turn Cox has sung praises for the show and the cast &amp; crew. Brian Cox was the key ingredient that, without him, the show wouldn\u2019t have that same driving force. He made Logan Roy a force of nature, his cruelty and cunning wasn\u2019t just fierce it was Shakespearean. Who the fuck cares he doesn\u2019t watch the show?

That's just true of jobs generally.\n\nHe also says that for him, the doing of it is the main thing, not just watching himself. \n\nWhich is frankly a sign of being well adjusted. I remember that Aziz Ansari had a bit about Kanye listening to his own music. There's an element of narcissism inherent in viewing ones own self through ones work.",

Which is, something. \n\nAnd as far as his cast mates acting methods, a lot of people had something to say about Strong's acting method, but only Cox got heat for it. In short:\n\nOn Succession, Strong intentionally deepened his alienation from the rest of the cast by timing his visits to the makeup trailer so that he is the only one there at the time. His costar Kieran Culkin has described Strong as being in \"a bubble\" before shoots: \"It's hard for me to actually describe his process because I don't really see it\".[7] Culkin has stated that Strong's methods are not intrusive to his own process.[17] Matthew Macfadyen has described Strong's techniques as \"not the main event... That's not to say that's wrong. That's just not useful\".[18] Brian Cox, who portrays Strong's character's father on the show, has expressed his concerns that Strong's intense approach to acting may lead to early burnout. However, he added that Strong's performance \"is always extraordinary and excellent\"",

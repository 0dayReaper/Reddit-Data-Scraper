After reading Selma Hayek's account of making the movie Frida, Weinstein seemed to make a lot of creative and business decisions based on what was in his pants. He tried to destroy that movie on numerous occasions but she wouldn't give up and it ended up with a bunch of Academy Awards anyway. You can only luck out like that so many times. If he was treating all of his other movies the same way, I'm surprised any of them did well. His brother may have felt that Harvey's luck ran out and it was time for him to go.",

So she finally shot the scene which was really traumatic because she sort of felt like she was being raped by beimg forced to do this sex scene. \n\nThen it's done and she thinks it's great, but he refused to release it and was going to send it straight to video. The director fought to show it in one theater in N.Y. and if it got at least an 80 rating with the audience he would release it. It got an 85, but they had to fight to get it into an LA theater. Later it ended up winning multiple academy awards, and he was going to pull the plug if she didn't do a lesbian scene, them he was going to to send it to DVD.\n\nSo how many other potential hits did he kill with this nonsensical behavior? How much money was lost on pre-production and shooting only to be stopped early, or sent to DVD on his whim? All because his priority was his own sexual gratification. I could see where someone in his company, his brother, the comptroller, members of the board of directors, major stockholders, etc. would eventually decide he's doing more damage than good.",

Even those artists don't get what they tell you they get. Yes, their contract might state x million but what they don't tell you are the fees they have to pay.

His 1979 testimony, in the case Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., noted that he did not object to home recordings of his television programs, for instance, by families in order to watch them together at a later time. This testimony contrasted with the views of others in the television industry who objected to home recordings or believed that devices to facilitate it should be taxed or regulated.\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers#VCR)",

Turns out someone by the same name was a Mormon in good standing in the state he was coming from. They hired him based on credentials and being a Mormon. \nAfter he had worked a while, it was brought up that he had not switched to any of the local temples. He, in his innocence, said that was because he is not a Mormon.  \nThe campaign of terror began. They wanted him to quit, not be fired. I imagine it was because he was so high up in government, and thus so high profile. Constant slander, new hires being brought in that would then harrass him to the brink of sanity, file false charges only to drop them, make multiple complaints to HR to make a paper trail, then drop the complaints.\n\nHe finally did quit, and left the state.",

Anywhere there is a hierarchy, (whether climbing the corporate ladder or especially politics) there is going to be someone exploiting their power. Basic human psychology. Now, not nearly everyone is like that, but you don't need numbers when you are one of the very few that already has power consolidated. Celebrities in my opinion have a little more of an open platform to discuss these atrocities because they are representatives of entertainment. Everyone who watches TV or movies has seen the majority of their faces and most have even grown up with these celebrities on their TV. Whereas, there's a disconnect with these CEOs and politicians because we don't see or even know all of them. It's really difficult for anyone in the workplace to bring exposure to any type of harassment without feeling like they may lose their job and future employment. Hell, even trump has multiple accusers lined up right this moment but nothing is being done? Even on his campaign trail!!  I think within these next few years, there will be many outings, and it won't just be the entertainment industry. ",

Then the times person of the year came out, and it featured Crews in the article. \n\nI am not sure anything new has happened to Venit.  I havent read anything about him being fired or some of the big name stars he represents firing him. \n\nIt sucks that this is happening but it makes sense.

On 22 February, she hinted on Running Commentary that Mizzi had connections with Panama and New Zealand. This compelled the minister to reveal the existence of Rotorua Trust, a New Zealand-registered family trust, two days later. On 25 February, Caruana Galizia revealed that Schembri also owned a trust in New Zealand which in turn held a Panama company.\n\n&gt;The April 2016 leak confirmed that Mizzi owned the Panama company Hearnville Inc, and that Mizzi and Schembri had also opened another company, Tillgate Inc. The companies were also owned by the Orion Trust New Zealand Limited, which are the same trustees of Mizzi and Schembri's New Zealand trusts, Rotorua and Haast respectively.\n\n&gt;As the first person to break news of Mizzi's and Schembri's involvement in Panama, she was subsequently named by Politico as one of \"28 people who are shaping, shaking and stirring Europe.\" Politico described her as a \"one-woman WikiLeaks, crusading against untransparency and corruption in Malta.\"\n\n&gt;In 2017, she alleged that Egrant, another Panama company, was owned by Michelle Muscat, the wife of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. These allegations resulted in Muscat calling the June 2017 general elections, which saw Muscat's Labour Party remaining in government.\n\n\nHer name is: Daphne Caruana Galizia\n\n\nLooks like she pissed off the wrong politicians and got ended more than anything.  I mean, she triggered a bloody snap election.  They were probably waiting at her heels to off her.\n\nPoor woman.",

    "postText": "\"Xavier: Renegade Angel\" is a 2007 Adult Swim animated series that ran for only twenty episodes, with each episode being eleven minutes long. It was not received too well during its release, but now seems to have slowly been gaining a massive cult following on the internet. A lot of you have probably seen clips of it floating around YouTube once in a while.\n\nThe series follows Xavier, a weird shaman amalgamation creature who is essentially the stereotypical New Age spiritual white hippie guy, who wanders around seeking answers to the mysteries of life and helping people in need with the help of enlightenment. But in reality, Xavier is nothing more than an ignorant, oblivious, narcissistic idiot with a savior complex that always goes looking for trouble where there isn't any in order to stroke his own ego, and preaching philosophical and spiritual nonsense that he doesn't actually understand, and in the end of each episode, instead of learning and fixing his mistakes, he only makes things worse and ends up destroying everything he touches.\n\nThe show is famous for its hideous-looking animation, crude style, chaotic pacing and look, and extremely random humor. This show is literally a fever dream come to life. The show is best defined by it's really dumb nonsensical comedy, every second of this show is filled with childish jokes, sexual innuendos, double entendres, gross-out humor, and just plain randomness and absurdity. The show follows no rules and you can never predict what'll happen next. People like to say it feels like an AI-generated show, and while it is as chaotic, the chaos and weirdness of this show is way too thought out and focused to be AI, but also feels too random to come from the mind of an ordinary person.\n\nNow you might think that this is one of those \"turn off your brain\" silly shows, but it's not. This is a show where you really have to pay close attention to every second and needs several rewatches for you to be able to catch all the jokes and hidden satire, because in your first viewing, you will definitely just spend 90% of the time being caught off guard by its weirdness, but the more you rewatch it, you're guaranteed to notice and realize things you never caught before on your previous viewings, as there's a lot of subtle jokes and wordplay you'll definitely miss on the first viewing, because the show churns out a joke every second that you'll never be able to catch all of them on your first viewing. The show as a whole is also a satire on New Age spirituality and the dangers of it, which is perfectly represented by the character of Xavier, who as I mentioned, is an ignorant narcissistic idiot with a savior complex that doesn't actually understand or follow anything he preaches and only makes things worse in the end. Each episode presents this satire pretty well with each story, as while it may not be noticeable on first viewing, the plot of each episode contains a lot of smart and subtle satire on spirituality and religion (although there are some episodes with none of that and are just weird and absurd for the sake of it, but then again the entire show is).\n\nNow don't take it the wrong way, this isn't a show that's \"actually really deep\", because it's not. This is still a stupid nonsensical absurd show, but it also has a lot of nuance and smart things to say. It's less a \"seems stupid but actually really deep\" show and more a \"stupid show that's actually really smart too\" show. It's a really dumb show written by really smart people. It's a show that says so many things, while also saying nothing at all, but at the same time still manages to say a lot. The show, like the character of Xavier himself, is very contradictory and complicated but also dumb, it's a show that requires thinking but also makes fun of people who think about things too deeply, it's smart but also just plain stupid, and that's what makes this show so unique.This is a show that deserves a lot of attention in my opinion.\n\nThe show won't be for everyone, as its humor and style require a certain taste and needs a lot of tolerance, but if you can manage it, this is a show that is really worth checking out. It's an experience you won't find anywhere else, and it's a show like absolutely no other.",

            "comment": "This show is one hell of a trip. For context, the closest show to an acid trip is Superjail in my opinion, where everything is about the visuals.\n\nOn the other hand, the closest thing to a shroom trip is Xavier: Renegade Angel. This show will subvert everything you know, invade your subconscious with a relentless, non stop choo choo train dialogue chains going at a steady 25mph school zone speed (trust me that\u2019s fast when you lose concept of time) without ever gaining or dropping speed. Like you said, you really need to pay attention to understand all the stupidity and the dump Xavier takes on your chest, dropping wisdom and knowledge without you ever realizing what the fuck just happened.\n\nPeople either really love this show, or hate it. There\u2019s a reason why this show has a cult following with fans who will die on their sword claiming it\u2019s the best show written. By the way, excellent review describing this show. Most people who make threads just say generic things like it\u2019s \u201cthe best thing they watched\u201d and \u201cyou need to watch it\u201d, but you do a great job explaining the nuances and what makes this show unique.\n\nUnrelated, but I leave you with Xavier\u2019s [message](https://youtube.com/watch?v=mzwJSwfhWQo&amp;t=7m37s) to all the toxic Redditors.",

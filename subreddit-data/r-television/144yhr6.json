I know *Dr. Who* does this quite often with reincarnations, but I\u2019m trying to think of examples that are not \u201cexplained\u201d by the script.",

The recent passing of Whitfield and immediate shake up of the character dynamics (they're no longer slaves, completely different relationship between the gladiators and Romans) meant they had no idea what they were doing. You said it yourself, the writers didn't understand how to write outside of the arena.\n\nHOWEVER, season 3 is fantastic. Liam McIntyre finally understood he was playing Spartacus the king, different from Whitfield's Spartacus the slave. The story was nail biting tension and you know you're heading towards an end that is morally ambiguous. The villain is utterly engrossing and iconic, completely different to Batiatus, but equally commands every scene he is in. The human drama and tragedy is interesting, character dynamics are meaningful, and the final episode is a beautiful, painful, glorious hour, aptly titled \"Victory\".\n\nI have seen the show four times at this point and have shown it to multiple people. Every time I do, I skip season 2 entirely and just go to season 3. Not a single person felt they missed something and thought all three seasons to be equally strong. Just skip season 2, watch a synopsis if you want, and go into season 3. It's worth it!! \n\nPS. By no means is season 3 a masterpiece but definitely great enough to watch it, it's a must!",

When she next appeared she was recast with Mae Whittman who would play her for the rest of the show.  \n\n\nThe funny part is the character was supposed to be so dull and bland they would recast her constantly and no one would remark upon it.  However Whittman was so damn good as her they couldn't bring themselves to hire another actress and she kept the role whenever Ann would appear.  \n\n\nAlso Last Man Standing swapped out the wife's actress and never remarked upon it.",

The only other episodes he wrote were the pilot episode, the one in season one where Morty asks rick for a love potion that turns people into Cronenberg's, and the one where they make fun of the purge movies. He hasn't earned a single writing credit for the show since season 2. Basically all of everyone's favorite episodes (including the highest rated episodes of each season) were written by a rotating crew of staff writers and guest writers, and it also includes the pickle rick episode which was written by the showrunner of the she hulk show.",

Then she goes the rest of the season reintegrating herself into life, taking on a different identity at school and stuff.  But then it was revealed at the end of the season that it wasn't really Jennifer.  Jennifer was still in the ionosphere, and someone else took her place, so they had to figure out how to get Jennifer back.  They did get the original actress back for the end of the season, but I'm wondering if they would have kept the character as Jennifer if they couldn't.!&lt;",

But then they wanted to bring him back so they said he'd been held captive this entire time and finally managed to escape.  Unfortunately, before he could make it back to Port Charles, he was hit by a car, leaving him completely unrecognizable and in need of facial reconstruction surgery. \n\nAfterwards, he was of course left with amnesia while everyone tried to figure out who this mysterious man with unexplained memories of their town was. Luckily, Jason and everyone else eventually remembered who he was and things began to get back to the status quo. \n\nHowever, the original actor was ready to return at that point and it was revealed that this mysterious man hadn't been Jason at all, but rather his long lost brother with implanted false memories that really belonged to the original Jason.",

The eldest daughter got pregnant on prom night, and as a result, has a difficult life as a waitress, and doesn't go to college.  She's doing badly despite the help of her parents until her father literally opens up a restaurant for her to manage, which the older daughter does badly at!  It's actually a plot point that she starts off as a bad manager!  After being given a restaurant, and managing it badly, she finally gets enough experience to be a good manager, and the show ends with the implication that she would eventually inherit the store chain Tim Allen runs, but again, she only gets that position through nepotism!  The show makes it clear without her father to help, she would have been drowning due to having a baby as a teenager!  \n\nHer boyfriend, later husband serves as the liberal punching bag who runs away from parenthood because he's so liberal, and gets a college degree instead of helping raise his son.  He returns, but despite having a college degree, he can only get low-paying jobs until Tim Allen's father, his Grandfather-in-Law, gifts him a weed store, where he then becomes a success and conservative.  But again, the storyline sabotages it's own Conservative credentials, because, despite having a college degree, despite being a hard worker, the guy can never move past low-paying jobs until the gift of the weed store, where he becomes an instant success.  The moral of his story seems to be no matter what you study, no matter how much you're willing to work, you won't be a success until you're given a business, apparently, the best thing the guy did in order to get success was marry the right woman who has a rich grandfather. \n\nThere's a good-natured but stupid menial worker who dates two of his daughters and eventually marries the 2nd one.  Again, a big deal is made of the character just not being very smart, but since he marries one of the daughters, he basically gets a good job from Tim Allen.  Despite being dumb, the best thing the guy did was marry the boss's daughter.\n\nThe 2nd daughter is bad at school but eventually matures into a mother who works at Tim Allen's store, again, getting a good job through nepotism, despite a big part of the show being how little talent she had.  I don't think we ever learn what job she gets at the store, do we?  \n\nEven Tim Allen, who is presented as a person who pulled himself up by his bootstraps, had a fight with his father and thus never received any help from his father, is only a success because of patronage!  The store only exists because his rich partner funded Tim Allen so he could start\\open the chain!  Without his rich partner, Tim Allen would not be the success he was in the show!  \n\nI like the show well enough, it's a fun sitcom to watch and put in the background, I catch it whenever it's on TV and enjoy it.  But the show always struck me as strange for how conservative it was, and yet how it seems to go against its own Conservative viewpoint.",

Ed Skrein was way more towards the right energy really. I think it's just that that energy is so repellant once its being portrayed on screen rather than the page.",

In the original episode where we first see Sheridan's wife in a video message she left for him it was not played by Melissa Gilbert.  Later, when they brought the character back, the original actress wasn't available so they cast Bruce's real life wife, Melissa Gilbert, in the role.\n\nAlso, Na'Toth, G'Kar's assistant was recast twice.  The first actress chosen never even got on screen, she couldn't handle the makeup and left before shooting any episodes.  Her replacement did a season, but was worried the alien makeup would typecast her and decided not to come back.  So, they recast, again, for the next season.  But the new actress didn't play the character the way the show wanted, so they just wrote the character out at that point.",

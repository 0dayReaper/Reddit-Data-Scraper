This is probably just showing aspects of the Upside Down that we didn't know existed yet. And there's the fact that the trailer itself mentions the Upside Down.",

The demigorgon aesthetically is very Lovecraftian, and the chilling mirror reality of the Upside Down is very dream spacey, which is something Lovecraft really explored.\n\nBut the hallmark of Lovecraft is cosmic horror, and with that comes a sense of dread, an inconceivable scale, and a horrifying realization of insignificance. To actually see a visual indication of cosmic horror in whatever that monster is that looms above Hawkins is truly chilling and calls to mind Cthulhu towering out of the ocean.",

Every shot in this teaser was beautiful, but there were two that really stuck out to me. The first being when Jim drove that shovel into the ground. That shot was so beautiful, it was very reminiscent of Indian Jones, and the second being when Will is looking out the door at that giant monster in the sky. I'm a huge fan of scale (for example, the work Gareth Edwards has done with Godzilla, and Rogue One), so seeing how large that thing was gave me instant goosebumps. I've watched the trailer at least 20 times now, and I'll probably watch it a million times again before I go to sleep. So hyped right now, super bummed we have to wait until Halloween \ud83d\ude31 ",

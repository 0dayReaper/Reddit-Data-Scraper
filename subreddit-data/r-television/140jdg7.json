Don\u2019t really know what show nowadays would be comparable as I can\u2019t imagine ren and stimpy being greenlit in this culture (creator issues aside)",

The best hype it got was that it was premiering after the Kids' Choice Awards, which is pretty decent, but not like must-see TV or anything. Shortly after that, it was popular but not like huge, but once it reached its stride, the hype was as big as Nickelodeon has pretty much ever gotten, even bigger than Rugrats or Avatar, which is why it went through (and is kinda still going through) a huge issue where new shows were having difficulty getting in the good graces of Nick executives because they were pretty much like \"If you're not Spongebob level within a year or two, get out. Focus on being like Spongebob.\"  Spongebob was EVERYWHERE after a few years, and the movie was a huge deal. It was a pretty fun time back then. Spongebob had some of its absolute best episodes around that point, and the movie was great.",

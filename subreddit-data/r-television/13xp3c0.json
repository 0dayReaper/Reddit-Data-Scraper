Watched the first few episodes on a plane and then binged the rest of the first two seasons that week. The sheer highs the show reached do make the third season a little disappointing, but overall one of the best shows I\u2019ve seen in years. Hope they continue with a spin-off (and it holds up better than Scrubs Med School did).",

(like the episode with nate and his father, the coming out sideplot) but even then there just wasnt a clear angle and the show kind of just 'ends' like i said. i really am frustrated with season 3. i honestly think jason sudeikis just didnt want to do another season 4 with having to film in the UK etc etc, so everything the writers had planned needed to be put on the table immediately.",

Instead we got 4 shit episodes focusing on Keeley and KJPR to fill time.\n\nThe random love triangle between Jamie, Roy and Keeley was also weird. Overall it was a pretty underwhelming final season even if the characters ended up in good places.",

We saw team members meet with Nate at the restaurant though. Ted clearly told Rebecca at the end of the 11th episode and it was obvious it was headed there anyway. We saw that Keeley and Roy had hooked up. I can agree that Keeley's work stuff wasn't done very well and Jack's character sucked, and Roy being a dick to Keeley was so stupid as was he and Jamie fighting in the last episode (after Jamie had weaponized the Keeley's sex tape) as well\u00a0",

    "postText": "It was pretty obvious that the podcast was reinvigorating their love of this series.  Glenn even said they didn't do their pre-filming ritual this year of watching a bunch of bloopers.  When they started writing and filming you could actually hear how excited they were.  Well Season 16 has started and the first two episodes are up on Hulu, its basically returned to form.  This season already feels like when they hit their peak in Season 5/6/7.  \n  \nIf you stopped watching Sunny you might want to consider coming back this year.  I haven't laughed this hard watching a sitcom in a long time.",

Like, the characters look completely different and it is just ignored by everyone. I wish they handled it more like season 7 when Mac got fat.  \n   \nStill a great show of course, but the plastic surgery situation is a major pet peeve of mine.",

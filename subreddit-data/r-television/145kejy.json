Should there be an all British cast again, should they reuse the old Hogwarts set or start over? Should they film outside the UK? Who do you cast as Snape and Dumbledore this time round and the main trio? Any ideas?",

Drop someone like J.K. Simmons into your TV series and you'll be able to give him a few words of encouragement to get six seasons and movie of a compelling character. But young children? You need to very carefully coach them through the process.\n\nThis can work in movies, where you've got all the time in the world for 2 hours of content. It can work in TV shows if those characters don't have much screen time.\n\nBut taking three young children and making them the central focus of your TV series and expecting them to carry the entire franchise on their backs? That's incredibly difficult, especially with an often rotating cast of directors.",

And the other is Harry Potter World which is still just nostalgia bait for the movies. \n\nIt just was never designed to be that big of a world. Everything is designed in service of Harry Potter's story that at best you can just sort of take some magical set dressings and try to apply them somewhere else, but it still is going to feel shallow.",

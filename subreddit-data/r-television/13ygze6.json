I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s a easy job bc when they used that Australian guy to move into his spin off, I did not like it. I think Gail could do it, but does she want that much face time? I\u2019m going to miss Padmas Bond villain aura and crazy outfits, but I don\u2019t think she added that much at judge\u2019s table personally.",

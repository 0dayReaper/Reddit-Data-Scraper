The MV shoot sequence wonderfully shows this and Lily-Rose Depp has really surprised me with her acting. Then the show turns into a weird porno whenever The Weeknd pops up and that guy CANNOT act. \n\nThe Idol is this weird hybrid where it\u2019s 30 minutes of compelling Hollywood drama and 20 minutes of PornHub-lite. I will keep watching for all non-Weeknd parts.",

The first half of the latest episode with Jocelyn shooting her music video was well done, and quite heartbreaking. But then when Tedros shows up and they have that weird sex party I lost all interest. Some defenders are saying Tedros is supposed to be over the top and cringey on purpose. But I still don\u2019t find him compelling to watch whenever he\u2019s on screen, and not even in a funny or ironic way, like some people are saying is the intention. It feels like Sam Levinson and The Weeknd are just using the character to have their creepy sex fantasies played out on screen, and any sort of message they\u2019re trying to convey with him just rings a bit hollow.",

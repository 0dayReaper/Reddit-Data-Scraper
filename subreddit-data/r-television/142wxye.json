But generally no, they won\u2019t suggest new lines to actors while filming (unless the director is also the creator or a writer or the showrunner). They might ask the actor to give a couple takes of the scene with slightly different inflection or with one or two words changed.\n\nTheir job is to get what\u2019s in the script on film. So if a director is in the middle of filming and notices a problem, they\u2019d let their boss know, and hopefully get some kind of change. But delays like that cost time and money.",

Making Joel more physically vulnerable to match his age, the twist on the Bill/Frank storyline etc. \n\nIt just needed to be paced a little slower to sell the Joel/Ellie relationship and not forget to show the threat of zombies in the latter half of the season. If it had done those two things it would be a pretty perfect adaptation.",

There's just the element of being in joel's POV, experiencing every death, having all the little side conversations with Ellie, that gives it so much more depth. And the world feels much more threatening. Love the show, but the game is amazing.",

They came out of nowhere and captivated people's eyes for years and the same way other shows are going to take the step forward. Shows like TLOU and House of dragon were shows with an already existing fanbase so the expectations were high already. That Robert Downey Jr show is done the line I don't know if it's a Max or HBO show, also True Detective, white lotus, euphoria who knows if the Idol pops but I always feel safe that HBO is going to drop another bomb soon.

Definitely need to revisit it soon\n\ngoogling I stumbled across [this](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2015/08/22/down-and-dirty-in-city-hall) review from 'The Economist' \n\n&gt; Still, people outside Yonkers may wonder why they should spend six hours of their lives caring about any of this. There are two reasons. First, because the questions it raises remain painfully topical. How does a politics based on faith that people will do the right thing defend itself against demagoguery? America has done away with legal segregation; how to do away with its legacies? How should people overcome the fear of their fellow citizens who happen to look different than they do?\n\n&gt; And second, because as drama \u201cShow Me a Hero\u201d excels. Younger viewers may find this hard to believe, but once upon a time American studios made films for adults, with nary a dinosaur, superhero or hunger game in sight. Directors such as Elia Kazan, Sidney Lumet and Spike Lee dealt with serious moral questions, and made urban realism riveting. Messrs Simon and Zorzi are their successors, but their work is richer, more sophisticated\u2014and better.\n\nI feel like we have had the same societal problems for thousands of years, and the Romans and Greeks probably had plays about it",

The writers' strike could push production on some of the more valuable properties like HOTD and TLOU, which would potentially be a killer, but not until early 2025 or so.",

Went to look into their development pipeline and it's very bare.\n\nAs far as Dramas the only confirmed ones who have full season orders according to Wikipedia are The Sympathizer for 2024 and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight which has no official date (assuming 2025 at the earliest) at how long productions take to make happen from the announcement.\n\nIn the Comedy section, we have Little Films, but also no premiere date. And The Franchise has a pilot commissioned for it. No release date or even confirmation of a full pickup. And that's it.\n\nAt least three miniseries are confirmed in development. Get Millie Black for 2024. The other two have unannounced premiere dates and they are The Regime &amp; The Son.\n\nApparently they have 23 announced shows \"in development\" in the Drama category, 13 in the comedy, and 24 miniseries. Not all of these will make it to series, and none of them have scripts, cast, and release date ready.\n\nAs far as current programing, of their 6 active dramas 3 of them will most likely not be coming back until 2025 (The Idol, Euphoria, and The Last Of Us) while House Of The Dragon won't be back until at least next year if not longer. The other two The Gilded Age and Winning Time could potentially come out, but they're not big IP shows and are def more mid compared to the other shows mentioned in popularity.\n\nAt least we got some comedy to look forward to. We have The Righteous Gemstones at the end of this month, and both Somebody Somewhere and The Rehearsal got renewed, so we'll probably see them sometime within this next 365 day period or so. They also have anthologies True Decective which has a new season coming up and The White Lotus will probably have another season come out within the next year or so.\n\nOh I forgot they have some international co-productions. My Brilliant Friend will have it's fourth and final season out sometime most likely this year or next, and Industry will have another season out as well. So thank god for the Italians and Brits! Keeping Drama alive on HBO after all.\n\nSo yeah, it's complicated, but it's def not gonna be busy over there with anything particularly buzzworthy for a bit unless they have some hidden cards they are holding such as shows farther into development then announced.",

All extraordinarily beautifully filmed and scored. Each season has its flaws, but far outweighed by its strengths.\n\nBut the point is that Westworld has been pulled from HBO / Max to avoid paying residuals. Currently the only way to legally watch it is on an ad-based platform like Tubi or to buy or rent your own copy of the show. Same goes for Raised By Wolves.",

Maybe John c Reilly\u2019s best role. Brody as Pat Riley and Clarke as Jerry west steal every scene. Then every supporting cast member is great(besides Dr.J). Magic vs Larry is gonna make for a great season 2. Really awful name though. For obvious reasons they couldnt call it \u201cShowtime: Rise of the Lakers Dynasty\u201d but winning time sounds so bad",

You just listed twelve shows that they'll air over the course of the next year, and that isn't even all of the scripted content they'll air during that time period. \n\nNow, obviously things are very different in the modern TV landscape, but my point is that HBO has never - and will never - be about \"volume\". \n\nFor instance, in 2019 (the year *Game of Thrones* ended) they released a network high 24 originals, in 2020 they released 23 scripted shows, in 2021 - following the pandemic - they released 17, last year they released 23 scripted series' (been including the 'variety' shows, to note), and this year they'll end up somewhere around 20 scripted originals. \n\nNot a huge number to begin with, and not a huge variance since they made a concerted effort to start increasing their output back in 2019.",

Which by your own admission is a significant reduction on the 23-24 show annual volume of recent years unaffected by Covid delays. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how a 25% reduction in output is being spun as a good thing for the network? Let us agree that this reduction in output is a big negative for HBO subscribers. The quality has been consistent at HBO from the days of 2 shows per year to the days of 23-24 shows per year. Less shows from HBO just means less good shows in the TV landscape in general. I see no way to spin that as a positive thing. It might have been possible if HBO had dropped the price recently but they have done the opposite and increased the price. \n\nI guess it could be argued that the increased price is to cover the addition of Max originals as well as reality shows from Discovery but I\u2019d argue that just, poorly, covered the loss of multiple top tier Pay-One movie output deals and the loss of top tier boxing on the platform. \n\nYou are clearly a TV fan. I just do not get why you see these cutbacks as a good thing? I\u2019m not saying HBO is dying but it seems clear that they have peaked as far as volume goes for the network and that it is now entering a phase of contraction and decline. Not terminal but definitely to a point where we can expect 25%-40% less output from them in the coming years from the peak AT&amp;T era. Obviously that is better than what has happened over at one time rival Showtime and HBO are definitely still a strong network but I\u2019m just not sure why we cannot just call this reduction a negative thing for subscribers and TV fans in general?",

In any case, since I'm subscribed to Max and also get all of that original programming, there's also a lot of stuff releasing soon on that front. So it's not like I'm wanting for great content from the service. \n\nBut ultimately, as you said, I'm a fan of good TV. I was happy with HBO when they had 6 shows back in 2006, and I'm happy (mostly) with the increased output we've had over the past few years.\n\nI don't, however, think that it needs to just keep increasing exponentially (nor that that is even possible). 'More and more and more' honestly doesn't sound that appealing to me. For one, that's not how you continue making prestige content.  Two, the entire economy is in decline, not just the entertainment industry; cutbacks are the reality of reckless spending, and it's happening across the board. Three, there's only so much free time to watch TV. And four, name me one thing that hasn't gone up in price in recent years...\n\n\"...if HBO had dropped the price recently...\" What an asinine thing to say, honestly. Do you also expect fast food places to drop their prices because the portions are smaller and the quality is lower? Of course not, they raised them, same as literally everything else. \n\nI'm not saying that these cutbacks are a good thing, I'm saying that I really can't do a damn thing about it, so I'll just continue to enjoy the fact that HBO makes really fucking good television that I get to watch whenever and wherever I like, alongside hundreds of other shows, and thousands of movies and documentaries, all for less than the cost of a movie ticket with a popcorn and something to drink. \n\nNot trying to sound like an advertisement here, but I feel like people have lost a little bit of perspective when it comes to how much better - and cheaper - all of these streaming services are compared to cable, home video, etc.",

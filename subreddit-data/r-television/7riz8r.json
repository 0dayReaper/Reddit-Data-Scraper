Things like that and the thumbnail of whatever time you're hovering over on the progress bar in some players were done in porn first, and now they're on youtube. Although Youtube is infuriatingly inconsistent with both, I have no idea why some videos have it and some don't. Or why they got rid of that awesome second bar they had for a while on long videos, where you could get extra control over parts of the video immediately adjacent to the part you were currently watching, so you didn't accidentally jump twenty minutes back when you were trying to go back ten seconds.",

The example was with Itunes.\n\nWhen Itunes first came out is was really good.  The system was simple, it was easy to navigate, and everything worked well.  This was years ago though. \n\nNow over time you have employees who only have one job.  That is to work on Itunes and make it better.  Well what do you do when something has reached a great setup and really no more work is needed?  Do you tell your boss that, who tells his boss, and then they are all let go?\n\nNo you add bloat ware to it.  You add \"new features\", that are \"about the user experience\" because that is how you keep your job.  Your boss also wants to keep his job, so he praises all the new things added by his team as helping the software become even better.\n\nHe tells his boss who wants to look good to upper management, and praises things too.\n\nThat is why now we have the horrible bloated piece of junk that is the Itunes.\n\nThis also applies to netflix to a degree.  You had a team that created a great easy to use library.  However they really had nothing else to do.  So they tinkered with the site.  They just kept twisted it more and more until we have the junk of a site we currently have.\n\nAs the same time though, netflix I believe purposely makes the site confusing because it makes things look larger than they actually are.  They want people to feel they have this vast library thats why its so hard to find things.  When in reality netflix only has B rated movies, a few gems of their own, and a dwindling tv library that is being taken by Hulu.\n\nI forsee Netflix taking a huge stock slide in the next year or two when they announce numbers are decreasing due to a mass exodus of the US base.  If it wasnt for their international growth, netflix would be screwed.\n\nMost likely Disney will rebrand Hulu, or keep it with the same name, since they now own a controlling interest in it after buying fox.\n\nHopefully Amazon finally decides to fire whomever is in charge of the prime video department and gives us a easy to use interface, because they really have a great selection but the an even worse UI than netflix.

Add some useful features from unogs.com, like searching from all countries then show which countries has the title and which subtitle languages are available, etc.\n\nI believe unogs.com used to show all country titles and stats but now it only shows popular 20 countries. Maybe expand it back to all countries on your site? \n\nI remember using their site to find a title and found it only on Iceland's Netflix. Fired up my VPN and connected to Iceland and watched it on Netflix no problem.\n\nAgain, great job!",

I was sad to hear that allflicks was going away (already for US, and soon for other countries). I don't like the UI that they're moving to.\n\nCould you make the list of what is available into a table more like allflicks, even if only as an option? That would increase the information density!\n\nAlso, HTTPS support would be nice - LetsEncrypt certificates are free and easy to setup on most hosting configs these days.\n\nCan I also ask - what is involved in doing a site like this? From what I understand, Netflix no longer allows API access, so only access keys existing before they change are able to make sites like this. Do you somehow scrape the actual HTML?",

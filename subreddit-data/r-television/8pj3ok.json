If you or someone you know is suicidal, please seek help. \n\nHere are some resources:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Worldwide Directories**\n\nWe know of two international lists that are maintained by reputable agencies:\n\n* [The International Association for Suicide Prevention maintains a **Global Crisis Centre Directory**.](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/).  \n\n* [The Befrienders](http://www.befrienders.org/need-to-talk) maintain a hotline database; use the \"Find a Helpline by Country\" control at the top of their page.\n\nDo be aware that there are a lot of online global hotline lists maintained privately by members of the public. Although these people usually mean well, the information on their sites is often outdated or incorrect. \n\n\n****\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**United States**\n\n* [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/):  1-800-273-8255 (TALK)  Veterans press 1 to reach specialised support.  \n\n(The older number, 1-800-SUICIDE, is no longer published by the lifeline agency and will probably stop working in the near future.)\n\n* Online Chat: http://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx\n\n* [Crisis Text Line](http://www.crisistextline.org/get-help-now/):  Text \"START\" to 741-741  \n\n* Youth-Specific services (voice/text/chat/email) from the Boys' Town National Hotline: http://www.yourlifeyourvoice.org/Pages/ways-to-get-help.aspx\n\n* Spanish: 1-800-SUICIDA\n\n_________\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Unsure if you should reach out to a hotline?**\n\nIf you are worried about reaching out through these hotlines for any reason, then please check out this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/1c7ntr/suicide_hotline_faqs/) which may address some of your concerns.\n\n_________\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe above information comes from our friends over at /r/suicidewatch who maintain an [excellent resource page](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines) that contains hotline numbers, chat lines, and more for countries around the world. \n\n/r/suicidewatch mods do not welcome posts that are primarily to discuss/debrief celebrity suicides. The sub exists to provide help for redditors who are having a rough time. If you go there to offer help, **read their rules** because they have extremely strict guidelines. \n\nShamelessly taken from /r/news",

Rather than a forced smile and a canned *Thank you*, you got to share a simple human experience with him. I think he probably really appreciated that.\n\nNot to mention it\u2019s a better story than saying you got a picture and shook his hand, and that was it. Thousands of people can tell that same story.",

Some things that have helped me are:\n\n1) This [essay by Albert Camus](http://dbanach.com/sisyphus.htm).\n\n2) Learning to focus on the moment. Like specifically, become as aware as possible of what you are doing, what the room smells like, what does it feel like to be sitting/standing/lying down? What textures can you feel? What aches? Don't think about past failures or future worries. Find an object nearby, even one you've interacted with a million times, and just look at it. Discover something new. \n\nIt's a great way to not only slow down time but it can also really help me to feel appreciation for just how amazing the human body/mind is at taking in information from the world and processing it so that the conciousness can understand it. \n\n3) Allowing yourself to find joy in stupid things.\n\nI used to feel guilty about all the time I spend playing video games but I finally realized I play games because I like them so I should just enjoy the time I play them. I have a job, I take moderately good care of my health, I don't have to spend every waking hour being productive. I can enjoy being idle for a few hours playing Overwatch and not feel guilty and like I should die because the world would be better off with a lazy POS like me.\n\nTelling myself it's okay to enjoy a thing has been really helpful in not feeling so guilty and depressed whenever I do that thing.\n\n4) Realizing that no matter what happens when we die (heaven, nothing, waking up from a simulation, reincarnation, etc) this is my only chance to be me. No matter what this version of me will never exist on this plane of existence again. Even when my life is shit and all I can think about is ending it, it is a unique opportunity to experience these things. \n\n5) Finding a therapist I like and getting on meds. \n\nFirst I'll acknowledge that I'm incredibly lucky that I have a job with good insurance that affords me the ability to do this. I did not thave insurance from 18-35 and I had to deal with my anxiety and depression as best I could. It took me until about 6 months ago to find a therapist I like and it wasn't until things got really really bad that I finally was willing to give meds a try. \n\nI'll also acknowledge that being on meds is part of what make 1-4 as effective as they are for me but I honestly think that those things are also part of why I lived long enough to get on meds and be as okay as I am now. \n\nI still have bad days and their are still days when I struggle to function. But the thoughts of suicide are almost non-existent now and even if I'm not \"happy\" every day I feel pretty content for the most part and I'm very grateful for that. \n\nAnyways, sorry to rant/reply. Not sure if any of this is helpful or just annoying. Your sentiment about getting older felt familiar and so I wanted to share my experience. \n\nHope your Friday goes well and you're able to find a little joy today. \n\n\nedit: fixed some typos",

Not jealousy if the mourning or attention or the other social aftereffects: jealousy of the death itself. It's like there's this subconscious part of me that wishes my survival instinct wasn't as strong so I could just give in and just... rest. Stop. Release. I know it's a disordered, invasive thought - as well as completely illogical - but it still happens. \n\nHearing about suicides can exacerbate that feeling - I'm jealous of their being able to take the final step that I (sometimes) feel I should, I'm jealous of their release from living. In its own way, if I were in the wrong frame of mind, it could easily be as you said and feel like an encouragement. \n\nYou always hear about an uptick in suicides after a celebrity kills themselves, and I wonder if I'm alone in my reaction or if it's what others feel too and they're just hitting their limit of temptation based on seeing someone else give in. Bourdain admits to having struggled with ideation himself so I do wonder if Kate Spade's death had a similar effect on him. \n\nBut such a reaction is hard to own up to, even in therapy, so elevated danger/crisis in response to these kinds of invasive thoughts is extremely stealthy :(\n\nETA: I'm thankful to the people replying confirming that this happens to them too - I probably didn't express it well enough at the end there but part of the reason I feel like this particular thing can be such an insidious/stealth danger sign is because it goes against pretty much every social norm that you're *supposed* to feel in response to death... so when you experience it, it can feel shameful and isolating. For me at least, knowing that it's a symptom for others as well makes it easier to admit to and talk about, and it's my hope that others reading this who share this experience have that same feeling and realize that it's something they can admit to their therapist or doctor without being afraid or ashamed.

Took over 20 years, when I approached her age at death, for me to begin to understand her pain and forgive her for being a terrible mother and to forgive myself for my feelings about it.  \n\nJust recently I have been connected with a 15 year old girl whose mother killed herself last Christmas eve. The \\*first\\* thing I asked her when she agreed to talk to me about the trauma was \"is there any chance that you have feelings like relief or gladness about her death?\" She hesitated for just a moment and said \"yes, she was mean and a drunk and a drug addict and nobody outside the house knew.\"  Fortunately, this girl is in therapy and already has a professional to tell her that those are valid emotions and she is fine to have them, but she was so relieved to meet someone else who had felt the same way and was not, in fact, a piece of shit.

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\u201d",

Any way. \n\nBeing a celebrity, having children, being rich, being loved and adored by millions of people, all that stuff doesn't really enter into the equation. \n\nThis Hollywood idea that insurmountable horror can suddenly be surmounted once you remember that some person exists that you love and that loves you is bullshit. Sometimes depression becomes so overwhelming and all-encompassing that you only have two options: suicide or checking into a psychiatric facility. And for some people, the latter option simply isn't one.",

I tried and ended up in ICU for days but made it through. I was 17 and when I mixed over 300 pills with vodka I just thought I would lift a burden of everyone around me. That they would feel better once the shock had worn off and that their lives would be better without me in it.\n\nI ended up in an inpatient place for 3 months in which I did not see my family, I could not as I was ashamed but I also knew that if I did not really work on why I was in so much pain all the time. \n\nIt took me a while but I got through it. I am still here 19 years later and currently I am going to see the love of my life daily in an inpatient place as he just sat on our bed one day after spending the day trying to get help (he had noticed something was not right with him) and he looked at me and just said \u201cI tried to get help, that didn\u2019t work. Now I will kill myself\u201d yesterday during my visit he was crying and begging me to let him die.\n\nI now know how my family felt 19 years ago. He didn\u2019t see me for 2 days and it tore me apart. I know he is in a form of hell right now but he will get through this. It might just take time but he will smile again.\n\nHe makes me a better person, i feel alive when I am around him. I was always very guarded around ppl but he just broke through every wall and gave me the feeling of being home.\n\nNo matter how bad you think things are there is always at least one person that loves you and whose life you make better on a level that they might not express verbally but that person is there.\n\nPlease talk to someone you trust or call a hotline to talk about what\u2019s going on",

I left a letter on my desk... if someone finds it and confronts me, someone cares. If not... well I don\u2019t belong and would end it that night.\n\nLong story short, my mom was \u201ccleaning\u201d my room that day and found the letter. She saw me, gave me a hug, started to cry and asked me why?  With her by my side, I started to get help. Meds, excersise, etc. and I don\u2019t feel like that anymore.\n\nI now have two little girls and a family to take care of and I\u2019m happy.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is... talk to someone. Talk to someone who you trust and tell them exactly how you feel. I know this isn\u2019t much from an internet stranger, but life DOES get better and you never know what the future entails.\n\nIf you ever want to talk, please PM me.\n",

Myself included, I've known many people who would say their love for their pet was the thing that kept them on earth, even when they had children.\n\nGranted, I don't have kids, but I can still hypothesize about the thought process from conversations I've had. Kids grow up. Doesn't matter how young they are, or who they're going to be left with after you end it. They'll grow up and eventually learn to take care of themselves, and one day someone will explain what you did, and they'll understand the concept of depression and death and self harm and suicide. They won't be happy, but they'll learn to take care of themselves, in time.\n\nAn animal won't. Where somewhere along the line a child will turn into an adult and understand death, your animal will only see 'they're not here', and no one will be able to explain to them you're not there to feed and take care of and love them anymore. They won't and never will get it. They always have and always will rely on you for survival.\n\nAgain, it's a shitty thing to do regardless, but the general idea that 'one day you'll understand' doesn't apply to both seems like the reason a lot of people hold on.",

It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.\u201d \n\n- Anthony Bourdain \n\nThank you for inspiring me. From your books to your shows you have truly expanded my view of the world like no one else ever has. \n\nYour books challenged me to question the status quo; to ask hard questions and not be afraid of making a few waves.\n\nYour shows let me walk in the shoes of hundreds of people from around the world. Sure, in the beginning I was just in it for the \u201cfood porn\u201d; the piles of delicious, regional perfection that you had the pleasure of wolfing down everywhere you went, but in the end that wasn\u2019t why I was watching. I was watching to see the world through another lense. To understand and empathize with those whose cultures are so different from my own. To recognize and be moved by situations I am too scared to go see for myself. I was watching to see the threads of every little square on this giant quilt that is humanity; and you took me there. \n\nAt some point, you said something along the lines of \u201cevery time we walk in someone else\u2019s shoes, the world becomes a better place\u201d. Well, Tony, I can\u2019t imagine the blisters you had from those thousands of pairs of shoes that you metaphorically wore in your travels, but I can tell you this; the world is a better place for having had you in it and I can say without reserve that you most certainly left a whole lot of good behind.\n\nWe\u2019re going to miss you.

We treat each other and the world around us like trash and when someone has the audacity to be depressed by this we tell them to \"seek help\" like they are the ones with the problem. \n\n\nSociety is more sick than any person ever could be and I dont have a way to fix that other than being generally decent but the rhetoric that comes out of these situations always seems like blame the victim mentality.

It was selfish but I was extremely mentally unwell at the time, I\u2019d asked for help but I\u2019d been told by a crisis team it was \u2018normal\u2019 for teenagers to feel suicidal. I didn\u2019t think it would take longer than a night to kill me, I spent the night in severe pain and threw up all over the floor by my bed. My mum knew what I\u2019d done as soon as she came to wake me up about 7am and I spent 3 days in hospital.\n\nI still occasionally have very bad days and the memory of her reaction brings me back from trying again. You can\u2019t imagine the disappointment, sadness, hurt, guilt, anger, love, terror she seemed to have all in one go. She was so angry in the car to the hospital and once she got over the shock, so incredibly loving and understanding. It really hurts to think about how she felt going home the evening after driving me to hospital and cleaning up the vomit in my room from trying to kill myself. I also left notes and she must have read them all when she got home. It makes me want to cry thinking about it, my poor lovely mum.\n\nI did that to her, that\u2019s the reality of suicide. A lot of people imagine suicide to be this big, dramatic event with their family members falling wailing over their bodies. More often than not it\u2019s a lot of silence, unspoken words, anger, terror, pain. Suicide really just passes on the problem, it doesn\u2019t solve it. If you are struggling, please talk to someone. Please tell a teacher if you\u2019re at school, your boss if you work, a neighbour, friend or family if you\u2019re at home. There is a lot of support out that waiting to help and, whilst some people don\u2019t recover, YOU might. That\u2019s a chance worth grasping when you\u2019re on the edge.\n\nEDIT\n\nI know how ironic it sounds me saying \u2018tell someone\u2019 when part of what tipped me over the edge was a crisis team telling me being suicidal was normal. I know how hard it is to stick it out and I know sometimes you tell people and they don\u2019t or can\u2019t help, part of the reason I tried was because of the terrible response I got when I told those professionals. But I\u2019m so glad my mum saved me and I stuck out multiple different therapists/medications, because now I can handle my problems and I have a really enjoyable life. My mum hasn\u2019t lost her daughter, my sister hasn\u2019t lost her sister, I haven\u2019t lost myself - in fact through treatment I\u2019ve gained more than I ever thought possible. When the depression blinkers come down it\u2019s SO HARD, I know how hard, but please know there is a chance to get better.",

This has nothing to do with it. The need to politicize everything is tiring. I was simply saying  we should be taking mental health in general more serious in the US. ",

It is so easy for others to dismiss people with mental health or to tell them to just \"be strong\", \"do some exercise\", etc etc. It is unfortunately much more complicated than that. Try telling a person in a wheelchair to walk it off. Mental health is equally important as physical health.",

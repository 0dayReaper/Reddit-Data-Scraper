Had they not split the season she'd be a shoe-in for Guest Actress but now she's in the same category as Rhea Seehorn (who was brilliant as Kim the whole series).",

They changed a few things, refocused aspects of the story, and added some cut from whole cloth for the series, but I get why they had to for the change in medium, from text to episodic visual storytelling, and I reckon they did an excellent job of preserving the spirit and nuance of the text. It's hard to say which I prefer, I like them both for slightly different reasons.",

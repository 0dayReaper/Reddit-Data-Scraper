Give me a choice of any media and it I'll pick A:TLA forever. It's in my opinion better than Breaking Bad, Mr. Robot, etc. etc. Nothing even comes close for me.\n\nI'm not even being hyperbolic here. A:TLA has this special combination of being accessible to all audiences, dealing with mature themes, having fantastic art direction/sound design, all with unparalleled storytelling. And I'm saying this as someone who watched the show a little later, so it's not even about nostalgia. But again that's just my opinion. \n\nI'm not saying the other shows suck, I loved Breaking Bad and do think it's one of the most impactful shows ever. But for me shows like BB, and others, just don't have the same kind of magic A:TLA has. Perhaps it's because other shows are relegated to their own niche whereas A:TLA is far more universal.",

It starts off as your typical \"monster of the week\" kids show with a bit of a persistent storyline that keeps coming back, and I think by the end of the first season you get multi-episode story arc. \n\nThere are a few good episodes in the first season, and it does a good job of introducing you to the characters, but honestly...when I do a rewatch, I usually only do seasons 2 and 3.",

[It's primary aim is to bring balance between the human world and spirit world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N_DoljFn9Q). But as time went on, the Avatar takes on duties to maintain the peace and keep order. \n\n**[BACKGROUND OF THE WORLD]**\n\nSome avatars were heavy-handed in their approach ([Kyoshi would kill a bitch for stepping out of line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viA5bbWuU7M)) and some were too lenient, unable to separate their duty from their own personal relationships ([Roku's refusal to kill Sozin out of respect for their past friendship.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLvfeG__Yw&amp;t=0s))\n\nAang, the current Avatar ended up locked in ice for a century after he tried to flee from his duties. He did not want the responsibility, but he has no choice. He is the Avatar in this lifetime and the next.\n\nBut during his absence, the world fell apart **hard**. The failures of his previous life to do what needed to be done ([Roku not axing Sozin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciQOLdN4Hh4)) allowed the Fire Nation to gain control and spend the next 100 years industrializing with the aim of conquering the world. Sozin's own agenda seems to have been perverted by his descendants as he saw it as sharing the glory of the Fire Nation with everyone. Zuko thought so too. [But it became clear the entire point of the war was dominion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v_zWLTiv68) **spoiler link**\n\nWhen the avatar dies, he is reborn into the next nation within the cycle (water-earth-fire-air). Roku was from the fire nation so Sozin knew the air nomads were exclusively in the air temples. So he wiped them out. [Since Aang ran away as a dereliction of his duties, he accidentally escaped the purge.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmBcjtp-9XQ) \n\nBut when the Avatar is reborn, it is known to the world. Without any tell-tale sign that he's returned, Sozin concluded the Avatar had to still be alive and went mad searching for him. \n\nThe fire nation also pushed forward and starting [rounding up water benders as well in case he was somehow reborn into that cycle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxQD1WejZ9k) \n\n\n**[THE CORE PLOT]**\n\nPresent day, [Aang is freed from his ice prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ_ZBodUuHA) and feels enormous guilt at what his failure as the Avatar caused. So he decided to go with his friends to learn how to wield the other elements and end the war. \n\nThe caveat is while other Avatars had ages to learn  ([Roku took 12 years to master the other 3 elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fl3YsIDipg&amp;t=0s)) Aang has to do it in less than a year. \n\nA comet is passing by earth which gives firebenders a massive boost to their powers. [The firebenders plan on using it to end the war, burn it all to the ground and start fresh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXShLPXfWZA) So now he has enormous pressure to finish it before that date arrives within 1 year. **link spoils finale**\n\nAt the same time, he's a monk. He has explicit teachings about the value of life, peace and the role that everyone has to play no matter how insignificant. He's lost with himself because being the Avatar is a duty nobody wants and a lifetime commitment from the moment first breath is drawn. \n\nHe is forced to rationalize his own being, [set aside his own interests and loyalties and feelings to keep the world in balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gepvSkMjjag) and all of this has to occur within a year. \n\n**[OTHER DETAILS]**\n\nThe show is an AMAZING character study and every member of the supporting cast gets some **DEEP** introspection and discovery. \n\nWatch the show, fall in love...or don't. I don't want to assume you'll be drawn in, but the show is solid. [Season 2 is my favorite season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7V3LL41CE) and it tells the most thrilling story that when it's over you feel some peace. \n\n[The final Agni Kai will leave you speechless!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHPOnWczkXc) **spoilers, obviously**\n\nAnd the voice talent is AMAZING. Luke Sky walker, Rufio from hook, the LEGENDARY Mako,!! They all bring some rich expressions to the characters! Everyone brings their A game.\n\n[And nothing will tug a heart like Iroh's arc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASkb5PRLa0) Spoilers.",

I feel like there's too much going on.\n\n1. The comics have been very successful. It has been over ten years since the finale of A:TLA and nearly 5 years since the finale of TLOK. Even after Nickelodeon's huge mishandling of the later seasons of Korra, the graphic novels are continuing to sell well and have received critical praise, showing that audiences are interested in new content.\n\n2. Bryke are returning for the live-action show. After Korra ended, Mike and Bryan said that they were interested in moving on to other projects after spending over a decade working in the Avatar universe. But less than four years later it's announced that they will be working on a new adaptation of A:TLA, which is an indication that they still have stories they want to tell in this universe.\n\n3. The fact that the live-action series exists at all. For a show barely ten-years out from the finale, A:TLA seems like an odd one to do a remake of. It seems like a proof of concept sort of thing. I really see no other reason for the remake to be happening besides as a way for Netflix to \"prove\" that the IP would be valuable to them. It makes too much sense. Korra was kicked off Nickelodeon and onto the Nick website partly because its primary demographic couldn't just sit down and watch an episode at a certain time every week. This is the same reasoning that has allowed streaming to grow bigger and bigger in the past five years. With the Nick deal happening, I can definitely see a scenario where higher-ups go \"The remake was a big success. Let's do another show.\"\n\nIt might be wishful thinking but idk.",

They were originally going to make a one season miniseries. After that was completed, Nick ordered another season. Then in the middle of production of that, they ordered a third and fourth season. I love Korra, but like you said, it is very uneven, and its why the third and fourth seasons are considered to be the best and most connected due to them being written together.\n\nIt really is a shame because when Korra was good, it was *really* good. Stuff like Beginnings and Book 3 are just as good as peak Avatar. Had Nickelodeon said \"You have four seasons\" from the start I think they could have made something that surpassed Avatar. But I still love it. And I definitely think Bryke have a ton of stories left in them in this universe.",

Agree that it could've surpassed the original show if they had support from Nick. The back half of the show introduced a lot of great characters and great ideas. \n\nI have a lot of hope for the live-action show because Korra explored maturer themes that weren't always Nick-friendly. Big reason why the show was kicked off of the network and finished airing online. A grown-up reimagining of ATLA, backed by Netflix, has a chance to be really special.",

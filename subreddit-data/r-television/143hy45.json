She\u2019s unbelievably hateable, and not very funny (no shade to the actress, she\u2019s doing a terrific performance - but the writing just makes her the most dislikeable and frustrating characters in the cast, and any attempt to give her dimension or a character arc feels disingenuous to her shallow characterization and petty personality). I think replacing her with a better principal character will elevate the show. Every other character works really well, though there\u2019s not any with Ron Swanson breakout character potential yet.",

To do that would just be depressing, and a comedy this lighthearted can't go to those levels.  \n\nFully hitting reality would just suck. Who wants to watch the episode where teachers and kids cower under their desks for 1.5 hours during the 5th shooting lockdown of the year. Oh it's probably nothing, but admin didn't bother to use the alert texts to inform anyone about what's happening, so the kids and teachers are trying to figure out who called in the bomb threat this time in their own texting circles. Jimmy is going to have to use the kitty litter in the bucket behind the bookcase because they can't open the door to the hallways yet. Hahahaha, this is so funny.",

It felt like a show that was filmed in the early 2010s and brought out of a vault and released in the 2020s. The way that they set up from moment 1 of the show Janine and Gregory without any real chemistry in those first few episodes had me rolling my eyes so hard. The show says \u201cthese two are the will they won\u2019t they romance that we\u2019re going to give you and you\u2019re going to like it because you\u2019re supposed to!\u201d It just felt so derivative and played out. Nothing I saw from it in those first few episodes was anything new or even a better version of the old office/parks and rec formula. I get that it\u2019s wholesome and that\u2019s what people need right now, but it isn\u2019t funny or thought provoking so the hype felt very overdone for me.",

It's extremely conventional. I'm not usually a network TV kind of guy (and neither is most of reddit lol), but this is good network TV. Season 2 is also much better than Season 1 was, but it is the same formula so it's safe to hop ship if you're not liking it. I enjoyed it though. \n\nIt's also a bit more grounded in its depiction of teaching and current issues in education, which is nice to see.

I don't have to think too hard, or remember little details from 3 seasons ago, or try and piece together every puzzle piece.  I can just turn it on and kind of turn my brain off for a bit.

Let that be the lead-in to a show with new, lesser-known stars. Create 10 shows like that and you're back in the money.\n\nStop trying to glom onto some part of the zeitgeist or the day's most trendy orthodoxy and just make a good show.",

A lot of talent both on and behind the camera are mostly going to want to get paid upfront and not work \"for free\" in hopes of the video making back the money long term. On top of this they are now taking even on even more risk themself for if the show does poorly.\n\nThis is not a \"studios are all great\", but studios do have their role in all of this in providing upfront capital for the show and marketing it along with networking all of the talent together, from the writers, to producers, to stagehands and so on. The writer and producer themselves are going to have a hard time just moving to youtube without nothing short of essentially making their own studio.",

That makes a lot of sense. \n\nI was watching Vox's video talking about how the streaming business led to massive cut downs in the payouts to people who worked on the show. So, I was thinking maybe if they had a business model where they get a consistent paycheck(through YouTube memberships), it could solve the problem. And since YouTube already has a great recommendation algorithm, marketing and publicity will be cheap. That was the hypothesis anyway.\n\nThanks for the info!",

This works in journalism, when a journalist or a group of journalists come together to bring content directly to the final consumer. But they only depend on their talents and a notebook. TV is much more expensive. Writers and directors are unable to pay for their projects.  Studios pay. In fact, there is a huge crisis at the studios, but if they don't pay, nobody will. The content will disappear and we will hardly see another model that works in practice.",

As for other creators/content etc. I doubt anyone has time to explain to you how it works, if you are actually interested check out how movies/shows are produced and how streaming services operate, Wikipedia would be good place to start :)",

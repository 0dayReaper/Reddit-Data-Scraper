It use to ne awesome. 30 to the ski slopes and 30 min to downtown Seattle. 1,000, of different logging roads and hiking trails a lakes to go to all less than 20 min from your house. The whole town had 2 stop lights. Then they built a casino and a million people from California and a bunch of other places making $300k+/year moved to Seattle and they all wanted a taste of rural living but still needed their Starbucks and North Face jackets and Subarus. No more small local town where you might see someone driving down the road with a dead deer in the back of their truck. Now it's just full of assholes. I'm sure they think I'm an asshole too but that is really the best way I can describe them. They are all just assholes and I don't like them and I wish they would all leave.",

These could also be reports like someone saying they saw Elvis at the supermarket but I\u2019d argue the horrible truth about Shelly Miscavige isn\u2019t that she\u2019s dead, but that she\u2019s still willingly part of Scientology, keeping herself a prisoner physically and mentally.\n\nhttps://tonyortega.org/2023/03/21/new-shelly-miscavige-sighting-actually-took-place-earlier-than-you-may-have-heard/",

Some are in debt over their heads and only keep things afloat by continuing to work and if that dries up they're bankrupt. Others put some away and live off that if things dry up... and some live paycheck to paycheck like many folks and again may be fine unless the checks stop.   \n  \nI had one friend with a number of Emmy nominations and several tony awards that was going to interview at Payless Shoes cuz he needed to keep the phone,  internet and lights on while he looked for his next job (and got one a week or so later that paid ~$200k for 3 weeks work) rather than 8hr selling shoes, but it was tight for a minute there.  \n  \nAt the time I said, you can't be selling shoes, motherfucker!  \n  \nHe said, why not?  \n  \nI said,  bc ppl are going to be asking for your autograph and selling pics to the tabloids (this was before social media as we know it now)  \n  \nHe said, bitch, i gotta do what I gotta do.

After getting a guided tour of the church, they sat me down in a small dark room to watch a short film while they prepped to give a personality test. The movie was all about how great L Ron Hubbard was. I researched brainwashing techniques afterward and could point out all the ones implemented in that video. It's been close to 10 years now and I can still clearly recall the jingle they used after mentioning something great about Hubbard. Anyway, it was a horribly unsettling experience and it was only until a couple years after that that some of the really horrible stuff they do became common knowledge.",

She does because celeb is 5'3\" 120lbs and couldn't lift himself on the counter so we know she did this of her own power.\n\nThey make out and celeb does/says awkward shit.\n\nShe doesn't ask him to stop but doesn't enjoy it.\n\nCeleb performs oral on woman.\n\nShe doesn't like this but doesn't ask him to stop.\n\nMore awkward, celeb then asks for oral. Woman gives it.\n\nWoman doesn't like it but doesn't ask him to stop. She says she needs to use the bathroom.\n\nAfter returning, woman voices discomfort. Celeb voices understanding. Instead of leaving she takes his invite to sit on/near his couch because.....he wanted to watch Oprah with woman?\n\nShe gives him oral again.\n\nEtc.\n\nEventually leaves and texts him the next day about how it was horrible and how he needs to not be horrible.\n\nCeleb reaponds privately with seemingly sincere regret at a misunderstanding and apology.\n\nWoman has 3000 word revenge-porn story written about celeb because.......righteous anger?\n____________________________________________\n\nWhat is described above is a groupie meeting a celebrity. I'm sorry but her actions scream \"groupie\". Further, her actions on the night are actions she regrets, not obvious clues to stop asking for the acts she still allows/performs anyway.\n\nWas Aziz right in his behavior? No, I guess not but only in the sense that he treated her like a groupie. I guarantee he's had this exact encounter a few dozen times. She wanted a boyfriend, he thought she was a groupie. End of story.\n\nNo way he forced her into anything. Again, he's built like a 13yo boy. He didn't attack or molest her. She gave him head on multiple occasions that night.\n\nShe was disappointed not assaulted.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I'm afraid to voice my actual opinion anywhere besides here because I'd be ostracized. \n\nI draw a line in the sand on this one, and the fact that it's so widely accepted as all out assault worries me for two reasons. First, as a man in the dating pool, it's scary. I'm a very receptive guy and I'm generally very good at picking up cues. But nobody's perfect, and one honest mistake or misreading can cost you your reputation or worse. But the scarier thing is that accusations like this one can backlash and cause a reaction in the opposite direction, undoing the important and hard won progress the movement has made so far. I feel like if I said that on Facebook, I'd be crucified. And that kind of environment is what ferments toxic reactions. I can't relate to a sociopathic monster like Harvey. He's a sick fuck. But yeah, I sure as shit could misread nonverbal cues. ",

To be honest, there isn't really a strict editorial process compared to more reputable magazines. The magazine is a great platform to let young people voice their opinions, but I'm unsure about calling some of the publications fact. I think they can be questionable. ",

Because the powers that be would be really frightened of people standing up for those, I think to an extent, outrage at stupid shit is tolerated, promoted and maybe even facilitated. \n\nHave a good day.

What to her may have felt like him being in a rush to get back to his apartment after paying the check may have been a perfectly normal progression between finishing a meal and returning to his place. The way in which the hooking-up escalated may have also been a perfectly normal way in which this stuff happens. No one hooks up by asking permission and getting confirmation at every step of the process \n\n'May I kiss you now?'\n\n'May I use my tongue when kissing you?'\n\n'May I put my hands under the top layer of your clothes?'\n\n'May I unbutton your shirt?' \n\nYou see if the other person is going along with it, do your best to read the situation, and you stop if they aren't or say they don't want to. That's exactly what Aziz seems to have done, even by the 'victim's own account - as soon as she said no, he stopped. And not only did he stop, he also didn't act like he was owed sex or angry that he was denied sex - he simply suggested they continue hanging out, but with their clothes on. \n\nWhat exactly has this dude done to justify being called boorish or aggressive or anything else? \n\nEdit: It's been brought to my attention that he continued making moves on her after she said no, like continuing to kiss her after watching Seinfeld etc. (I couldn't see that part of the article, and for some reason, I still can't. Is this a mobile issue?) I can see how that can constitute boorish behaviour. Still nowhere in the vicinity of sexual assault, though. ",

We get this idea nailed into our heads that being desired by as many women as possible is an ideal, so being desired by women is never bad and anyone complaining about it is just humblebragging. So how gross unwanted advances are gets lost in you looking weak or like you're bragging. It's ridiculous.\n\nPlus women are taught that men always want sex, so I think when they are willing to have sex and a man doesn't want to have sex with them, they conclude it's because they are undesirable. And I think some men sense this and decide to let unwanted advances slide because they'd rather be uncomfortable for a few seconds than make a woman feel undesirable. I also think there is an ego boost they get out of it because women making the advances happens so rarely that it means you must be desirable for it to happen to you.\n\nI've had situations that could be considered sexual harassment if the genders were reversed, but I think the fact that I'm male and most women wouldn't be able to physically overpower me makes the experience of inappropriate touching a great deal less uncomfortable for me than it would for a woman being inappropriately touched by a man. For example, I've had women who just met me grab my wrist, arm, bicep, or shoulder and hold onto it while talking to me, or brush my arm or shoulder while making eye contact with me and my reaction was annoyed at worst because I didn't feel physically threatened. Imagine that happening to a woman.\n\nNot saying any of this justifies the double standard, but there's a reason for it. I think where it gets messed up is when we don't acknowledge that a woman's desires can be every bit as selfish and predatory as a man's and brush off men being uncomfortable with unwanted sexual advances the same way sexist assholes brush off women being uncomfortable with the same thing.",

I get it, it really, really sucks if it just comes to he-said she-said and there's no physical evidence. But that's just the circumstance. Sometimes things really fucking **suck**. But at the same time, we're not going to just assume that every accusation is true and lock people up. \n\nInnocent until proven guilty is (and should be) the most sacrosanct law in our legal system, and it boggles my mind that anyone feels differently. The Innocence Project is still exonerating tons of people (mostly black men) through DNA evidence.\n\nSide note, go find that person and make them apologize to you.",

In the age of outing serial rapists, it's almost insulting that this is considered newsworthy\n\n'we were sitting naked on his couch and I thought he would rub my back but instead he pointed at his dick and I started sucking it even though I kinda didn't want to' Give me a fucking break. Calling this anything close to assault infantilizes grown women as if they can't make choices. It is the opposite of feminist \n\nEDIT: that's not a quote from the article, it's paraphrasing her account of the event ",

But they expect a certain degree of respect which they don\u2019t necessarily communicate to their male partners.\n\nAnd I think the dynamic of casual sex has changed quite a lot with the advent of increased technology along with female sexual liberation. \n\nBoth men and women are very confused right now with balancing the freedom of sexuality and an appropriate level of respect/\u201cmorals\u201d.  \n\nYou have women who are told they should be ever fearful/vigilant of hyper aggressive men...who are also highly attracted to masculine aggression and dominance, and enjoy taking a sexually submissive role. \n\nYou have a society that glorifies hookup culture through dating apps... while women are taught every strange man is a potential rapist lest they\u2019ve been taught not to rape.\n\nYou have men who are told to be fully respectful of consent....who have never been taught any strict standard what consent actually entails beyond \u201cno means no\u201d.\n\nAnd you have women who are told that anything other than enthusiastic consent is non consensual....but aren\u2019t taught the onus is on them to give or retract that consent, or how to do it.  \n\nAnd you have those same women who seem to be struggling between playing the submissive role, and understanding men are not trained mind readers...while taught if they speak up for themselves in uncomfortable situations they could be in physical danger.\n\nI believe this is the first time in history where female sexuality has grown beyond a male objectification. It\u2019s going to take some time for society to figure out the new standards of morality that entails.  \n\nIn my opinion it\u2019s necessary for the feminism movement to move past the \u201cbe fearful of male predation\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re a victim if you feel like you\u2019re a victim\u201d mentality to \u201clearn how to take responsibility for pursuing your sexual freedom within your comfort levels and expressing them verbally\u201d.  They\u2019ve become so caught up with the concept of avoiding victim blaming and telling women how discomfort = rape ...they\u2019ve forgotten to empower women to learn how to openly, and verbally communicate with sexual partners so that boundaries can be established. They\u2019ve forgotten to teach women where their own responsibilities lay in a sexual encounter to express consent. \n\nAnd at some point a social consensus needs to be reached on what is and is not appropriate consent, and the means by which it can be withdrawn.",

One's a credible allegation of sexual molestation and abuse and one's a I dunno a regret? Yet they both put #metoo so the press will treat them the same and clickbaiters will string people along to them. ",

We don't know why. \n\nFor Seasons 4-6, they did not appear in scenes together. Even though early seasons focused on their friendship, and they still worked together. It got more obvious as time went on.\n\nWhen Panjabi left the show, they wrote one final scene for them together. But there was an [awkward split screen effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL8pG5g0gLE) that made it clear they didn't film at the same time.",

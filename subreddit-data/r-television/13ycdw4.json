            "comment": "&gt; According to a report in Los Angeles Times, the Bakers claim that they were offered $300,000 for 30 percent of the company when they appeared on the show during season 5 back in 2013. The family then alleged that John revised the terms of the investment, offering $100,000 for 35 percent of the company, and entering the company into business with Rastelli Foods Group.\n\n&gt; Additionally, the family claimed that they've only seen around 4 percent of the publicly stated $16 million in revenue from the business, and claimed that Al Baker had been intentionally left out of important business meetings and decisions after John came on board.\n\nSounds like they got played by a typical business savvy investor. They don\u2019t call them Sharks for nothing. Any contestants walking into the tank should go in with a Mark Cuban or bust mentality.",

On the one hand, it is disgusting to see people with good ideas get played for chumps.\n\nOn the other hand, I watch (like a train wreck, I just can't look away) waiting for them to tell someone with an insane idea that he's completely insane. Like (and this is actually an idea that was presented on the show) a Bluetooth headset implanted into your head. In case this idea wasn't bad enough, it did not charge wirelessly, the dude legit expected people to plug a wire into their heads to charge it.\n\nThe \"dog ball with wifi\" idea, while said tongue-in-cheek, is why I can't look away. Someone will eagerly explain that this is a good thing because it ties to an app on your phone that tracks how much you play with your dog. Then someone (usually Kevin) will ask how much they've sold and the answer will be \"five\". Not five thousand. Not five hundred. Five dog balls.",

That one guy who claimed he can mine gold from the sea seemed pretty desperate but he certainly didn\u2019t need Sharks investing in that nonsense.",

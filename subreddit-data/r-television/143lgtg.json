He thinks he murdered his wife and the only man who knows otherwise, is happy to use that to blackmail him into being his body parts collector. He's sympathetic because he's meant to be. He hates who he is and what he does but thinks he has no way out, no other way to keep his daughter safe. He's so afraid of losing her, he kept her sick so she couldn't leave.\n\nHe's a murderer, a monster, and a hypocrite, but he's still 100% human throughout the whole thing. In that world, with that context, it's not so hard to understand how he got where he was.\n\nSorry, I just love that movie and I very rarely get to talk about it with anyone.",

Like,  they skipped several episodes, if not a season, worth of the part of the redemption arc that could possibly lead up to that. Like yes, Nathan had been having a lot of self-realization up to that point\u2026 but there was a massive jump to the team recognizing this, let alone the entire team wanting him back (sans Coach Beard). Like as far as we the viewers are concerned, the team had still only really known Nathan as the evil dick who left and treated everyone like shit. They just skipped\u2026 a lot. They just pulled a Game of Thrones S08 and stopped caring about connecting adjacent timelines properly in order to wrap it up.\n\nNow I do believe the finale was actually pretty decent considering, but man the tone and pacing was so uneven in a race to the end. I enjoyed the Amsterdam episode, but that\u2019s the kind of episode that only really should have had a place with two seasons to go, not one.",

I know she's really pleasant enough to Ted even in their divorce but FUCK I can't get over this hostility I feel for her. I thought maybe they would show a really dark side to Ted like he's a drunk or some shit, but really her primary complaint was that he was just too nice. Having shown how Ted improved the life of everyone he came in touch with, it's impossible to like someone who points that out as his biggest flaw. \n\nI know she was grieving but she has to have some responsibility hooking up with the marriage counselor as a grown ass adult too.\n\nShe may not be a villain, but I firmly believe she's a bitch.",

Imagine how conflictingly infuriating it might be to have a partner who makes it seem that nothing is important, that everything is a joke.\n\nThen again, that Therapist had his own agenda and clearly abused his position to get there.",

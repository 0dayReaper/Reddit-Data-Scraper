    "postText": "Hi.\n\nHope you\u2019re doing well.\n\nI really liked the Buffy episode The Body when her mother Joyce died and seeing her raw emotion and grief and how vulnerable and broken Buffy was and also how her friends reacted in their own unique ways was deeply moving and I think very realistic.\n\nI also liked on Scrubs when Dr. Cox\u2019s best friend Ben died and how he couldn\u2019t cope and we saw a very different side of him when he confides in even JD for the first time. Then later we find out Jordan was actually taking this harder than she was letting on with her tough exterior.\n\nGreat acting and depiction of grief on both parts.\n\nWhat are other excellent examples from shows of depictions of great sorrow and emotion?",

At the same time, &gt;!Marina Gregg is travelling to a mental hospital where her young son is being held; he was rendered mentally and physically disabled after she was infected with a serious illness which rendered him a complete shut-in and cripple; she tries to introduce herself as his mother but can't finish saying it and breaks down, crying.!&lt;",

It's season 1,  and you don't learn the full scope of that argument until well on in season 2.  It ends like this, Flint speaking about England, just haggard and exhausted and in so much pain. \n             \"They took everything from us, and then they call me a monster. The moment I sign that pardon, the moment I ask for one,  I proclaim to the world that they were right.  This ends when I grant them MY forgiveness, not the other way around.\" \n\n It's stuck with me from the first time I saw it, and every time it hits just as hard. Especially once you find out what they're really talking about. \n\n\nSpartacus War of the Damned. The last battle.  He's on a plateau overlooking the battlefield, gravely injured.  His friends find him and as they're carrying him away to safety he looks down and sees...they've lost.  \nYou know from the beginning how the story will end but it's still filled with such intimate agony, viewing it through his perspective. His speech at the end is wonderful also. Cried my stupid eyes out. \n\n\n\nAnd I'm going to offer a slightly different type of emotional as well. Mrs Maisel. Midge and Lenny spend a night together in a fever dream of a sequence, at his tv gig then drinks at an extremely atmospheric lounge, and the romantic tension between them is so thick a block of C4 wouldn't blast through it.  They walk back to his hotel room, he opens the door. They stand and look inside. \nAnd in that moment, Midges a choice. She wants him, and not the least because he is brilliant and he both understands and challenges her and it's sexy as hell. But she knows if she sleeps with him right then, people will look at her as the girl who fucked Lenny Bruce. No matter what success she finds, they'll say that first. She needs, more than she needs Lenny, to know that she did this on her own. \n\nShe asks him what he thought of her set. He says it was sensational. Those words are everything to her. \n\nShe walks away. Lenny watches her,just dripping with longing, and calls out \"Hey. Maybe some day. Before I'm dead.\"\n\nAnd the audience knowing that he will die young. Far too soon.  The weight of it.",

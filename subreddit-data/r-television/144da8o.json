Minnie Mills wrote on Instagram [about her departure](https://parade.com/tv/summer-i-turned-pretty-minnie-mills-exits-season-2). And then her sister Emma wrote \"[Treat your only actual Asian representation better](https://twitter.com/lukovist/status/1649048656480456707)\" as a hashtag on a fan's screenshot at the bottom. Something about the creator Jenny Han not allowing two Asian characters to be a couple?",

Maybe that part will change.... !&lt;",

Kinda unfortunate since I liked her character in S1.\n\n\nReading what it says, I\u2019m guessing that Jenny originally intended to have Steven and Shayla break up because of Steven still having feelings for Taylor while Shayla ended up with a non Asian guy (possibly Jeremiah or Cameron). Shayla\u2019s actress was probably against this and left the show.\n\n\n&gt;!Regarding what you said about Jenny Han not allowing two Asians characters to be a couple (or at least an Asian guy and an Asian girl to be a couple), I notice that too when watching X.O Kitty (another work of Jenny Han) a few weeks ago where Kitty had two Asian male love interest but then decided to make her bisexual and give her a female love interest!&lt;",

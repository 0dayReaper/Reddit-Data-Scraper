Brian Cox is a veteran actor and that ferocity in his work shows up naturally at this point, and (while it\u2019s a fantastic performance) it\u2019s not as nuanced as the role of Kendall requires. Over 4 seasons we saw strong cover an incredibly wide range of emotions and he did it perfectly. Method acting sucks but there\u2019s always an exception and I think we\u2019re looking at it.",

So many moments from him where I got straight goosebumps from his acting/line delivery (ex: \"I. will. WIN!\")\n\n\nI think the writing just required a bit more from Strong - Logan was always kind of in the same position for the entire show, the same character kind of? Whereas Strong - we see him cocky and confident in season 1, then back on drugs, then absolutely broken and regressed into a child for s1's finale, then empty and broken for most of season 2, then hype and cocky on another level for season 3, and a straight killer in season 4 - the range was just a bit bigger, imo, ya know?\n\nBut I agree, I'm split myself, it's very tough. I think that's one of the best things to treasure about the show - everyone was damn near perfect, it's impossible to compare and rank.",

But then I felt like he just kept stumbling backwards overpaying for that news station, being super wishy washy with the election coverage and negotiating with Matison. He just seemed to not be decisive, or would just throw more money at a problem. I wonder if the constant belittling and desire for approval from his father forced him to always question his decisions. In the first season he is so cocky until his dad takes him down a couple pegs a couple times.",

Then the scandal blows over, but Logan clearly appreciates the show of loyalty.\n\nI know Logan wasn't exactly lucid at the shareholder meeting, but he called him \"son\" at one point, and Tom was the only one who was by his side the whole time and actually tried to help him - a lot like Sandi and Sandy, IMO.",

He's often shown as this comically obsequious and spineless toady who never seems sure of anything, but looking back, he has the best survival instincts of the family.  While things like his anxiety over going to jail are played up for humor's sake, it's hard to think of a moment in the show where he doesn't end up backing the right horse, even going so far as to betray his wife in the process.\n\nIt's sort of like that \"If you come for the king, you best not miss!\" thing.  Kendall, Roman, and Shiv all come for Logan and fail, inevitably pushing them out of the company.  Tom stays on Logan's side, which helps advance him to a better position.  Shiv puts down Tom with the \"he'll suck the biggest dick in the room\" comment, but that's pretty much Tom being shrewd enough to know how to play the game to ensure he's constantly on the right side, and it ends up being something that encourages Matsson to choose him.\n\nTom being named as CEO could've felt really cheap, but if you look at his progress throughout the show, it definitely does not feel hollow.",

All of the siblings look down on him, because they just see him as this suck up and \"hanger on\", but he has more in common with the Elders than that group would probably be willing to admit.  People like Karl, Frank, etc. are all where they are, because they know what ass to kiss.  We never really see them push back much against Logan either.  They know when to challenge him, but will ultimately fall in line if that's what he demands.  Not that they aren't shown to be competent at their jobs, but it wouldn't surprise me if they started out as as big of suck ups as Tom earlier in their careers as well, or would they ever have ended up in Logan's inner-circle?\n\nSo, it really just comes down to how much of it is that Logan never successfully raised his kids to actually fit in this environment, which is why he never took them serious or saw them as ready to take over.  But, at the same time, he was fairly incapable of seeing how much he failed them.",

I think Fuches is the best example of this but a lot of characters on Barry show this as well, in my opinion. Like sometimes I feel the writer having an idea more than the character making a decision. The first 2 seasons I think didn't have this as much, but it seems kinda how Bill Harder likes things to unfold, which maybe he felt more comfortable leaning harder into as the show went on. Like it's more interesting math equations than natural creative narrative sometimes in terms of writing.\n\nObviously people love the show, and I love a lot of it as well. But there's something in how the characters behave that I don't personally like. I was thinking Barry and Yellowjackets seem to flop on opposite sides of the same coin, in terms of why I struggle to FULLY by in sometimes.",

Kendall is an incredibly multidimensional character - he is both the older protective brother and the puppy constantly getting kicked by his father and by life - and he displays both sides masterfully. He\u2019s a passionate smart business man at times and also a bumbling overconfident choker in other times. He\u2019s fighting the good fight and he\u2019s selling the future of America over to Nazis. It\u2019s such a brilliant character - so in his own head all the time. And his mannerisms, quirks and inability to speak outside of the corporate millennial buzzword lingo is incredibly entertaining and frustrating to watch. God I love and hate this character so much",

It's pretty much a lock for drama, writing (election episode or Logan's death episode), lead actress (Sarah Snook), lead actor (either Culkin or Strong). While I'm partially biased towards the show because I admire it, I wouldn't have any disdain even if I wasn't; it's really that damn good. \n\nAnd although I believe Snook wins for lead actress, I believe a series comparison would tip the scales in Rhea Seehorn's favour. Snook is better if their respective recent seasons are compared, but all in all, Seehorn's work is everlasting.\n\nAlso, Barry deserves a comedy win this time. Enough with the snubbing in favour of Ted Lasso, which by the way was truly middling this season.",

A Los Angeles Police Department detective later told Remini, \"She is fine,\" which Remini considered an unsatisfying response. \"I asked, 'Did you see her? Did you see her body? Was somebody speaking on her behalf?' \" (She recalls the detective replied, \"Can't tell you that, ma'am.\") Remini says the detective in question has since been hired to speak at Scientology events.\"",

That's when you give up your moral authority, in my book.\n\nI personally think the only principle they both have ever believed in is that of acquiring money and assets. And not paying taxes to any government. The foundation of their 'religion' is tax fraud.\n\nDavid Miscavige reminds me way too much of Jim Jones. Another cult leader who was politically powerful on a state level in California, so he was never investigated. He wasn't *even stopped from fleeing the country* to his compound at Jonestown, where he initiated and carried out the infamous mass Flavor-Aid murder/suicide.\n\nIt was largest single loss of civilian American life until the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nExactly when the feds and LOAs are going to grow some balls and shut down dangerous cults like Scientology (like Germany did), start taxing them, and stop repeating the same mistakes they have in the past by letting these criminals through their fingers, and actually put Miscavige et. al away, is anybody's guess.",

Here's some other fun samples of his writing.\n\n&gt; Scientology is the only specific (cure) for radiation (atomic bomb) burns.\n\n&gt; Not smoking enough will cause lung cancer! If anybody is getting a cancerous activity in the lung, the probabilities are that it's radiation dosage coupled with the fact that he smokes. And what it does is start to run out the radiation dosage, don't you see.\n\n&gt; We want at least one bad mark on every psychiatrist in England, a murder, an assault, or a rape or more than one\u2026 This is Project Psychiatry. We will remove them.\n\n&gt; Rate of change is this mathematics known as Calculus. \u2026 Now I hope you understand this, because I've never been able to make head nor tail of it. It must be some sort of a Black Magic operation, started out by the Luce cult \u2014 some immoral people who are operating up in New York City, Rockefeller Plaza \u2014 been thoroughly condemned by the whole society. Anyway, their rate-of-change theory \u2014 I've never seen any use for that mathematics, by the way \u2014 I love that mathematics, because it \u2014 I asked an engineer, one time, who was in his 6th year of engineering, if he'd ever used Calculus, and he told me yeah, once, once I did, he said. When did you use it? And he said I used it once. Let me see, what did you use it on? Oh yeah. Something on the rate-of-change of steam particles in boilers. And then we went out and tested it and found the answer was wrong.\n\n&gt; Leukemia is evidently psychosomatic in origin and at least eight cases of leukemia had been treated successfully by Dianetics after medicine had traditionally given up. The source of leukemia has been reported to be an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'\n\n&gt; A truly Suppressive Person or group has no rights of any kind and actions taken against them are not punishable. (...)  Fair game. May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\n\n&gt; If attacked on some vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any organization, always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace.\n\nAnyone interested in Scientology should read Lawrence Wright's book -- the basis for the HBO documentary \"Going Clear\" -- and his articles. He investigated Hubbard's life, and it's just hilariously awful. He took Hubbard's military records, which the Church provided him, to the US Navy and spent an afternoon with a guy running the archives. He immediately pointed out that (A) Hubbard claimed to have received medals that did not exist at the time, (B) Hubbard claimed to have received medals only awarded by the British to British sailors, (C) Hubbard claimed to have been onboard ships when records show he was on land in New York, (D) his records from the 40s are written in a font not invented until the 80s, (E) the officer who signed off on his medical report did not exist and there is no record of him, and (F) no military psychiatrist would describe someone as \"the sanest man I have ever met.\" Wright brought this up to the church official who gave him the report, who was then placed under church discipline and became unreachable.\n\nMy favourite reveal, though, was Wright discovering that what Hubbard described as \"a journey through the heart of China, becoming the first white man to learn the ancient secrets of the Chinese magicians and meditating for weeks with the silent monks\" was actually a 10-day trip to Beijing with his mother.",

If confirming by phone, even ignoring the possibility of impersonation, how could you be sure the person was not speaking under duress while being held against their will?",

Some people claim to have seen her in the nearby town as recently as April last year.

The whole thing was actually a terrible misunderstanding born from a bitter spat among them and Henry ii was quite saddened by Becket's death. \n\n&gt;Henry II asked the pope for forgiveness and he walked bare foot to Canterbury to pray at the spot where Becket was killed. Monks whipped him while he prayed.\n\nhttp://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/medieval-england/thomas-becket/  \n\n\n&gt;Two years later on July 12, 1174... (the king) made a pilgrimage to the tomb of Becket but it was not just any pilgrimage. He dismounted from his horse as he came in sight of Canterbury, walked as a penitent pilgrim in a woollen shirt, with bare feet, through the streets, knelt in the porch of the cathedral and kissed the sacred stone on which the archbishop had been murdered. He wept before the crypt and spoke of his remorse at uttering those fateful words. threw himself prostrate before the tomb in the crypt, and confessed to the bishops with groans and tears his deep remorse for the hasty words which had led to the murder.\n\n&gt;What followed next is surely one of the most humiliating acts ever undertaken by an English monarch. He was scourged by the monks, abbot and bishop upon the tomb of St Thomas where he implored for forgiveness.\n\n&gt;....\n\n&gt;Henry II built a chapel dedicated to Beckett at Dover Castle and continued to regret and seek to do penance for the death and murder of his friend and confidant.\n \n\nhttps://www.intriguing-history.com/thomas-becket-henry-ii/   ",

Debbie Cook was a high ranking member that left the church and criticized the leader David Miscavige. They sued her for millions for doing this. First day of trial Debbie speaks in court about how Scientology had her imprison people in \"The Hole\" and she then later was imprisoned herself. Scientology immediately settled with her after one day of trial as they didn't want the public hearing this stuff. \n\nhttp://tonyortega.org/2017/01/01/five-years-later-debbie-cooks-indictment-of-scientology-under-david-miscavige-annotated/",

            "comment": "Scientology is terrifying. Years ago my now mother-in-law and I took my wife to a rehab center in Central California. We found it through research and by all indicators it seemed to be awesome. Cost almost 40k for a resort style place with awards all over the walls. Only after my wife was there a few months did we realize something was off. Turns out to be Scientology. For the first few months she was calling home and seemed terrified of the place. I insisted she stick it out and wouldn't give in. Finally she started hinting that the phones were tapped and that she really needed to leave. I drove out to pick her up and mind you the place is an hour drive up a mountain(nobody could just walk away and make it to civilization without a daylong hike). Once I saw her she ran to the car like she was running for her life. Apparently she had sneaked away from an awards ceremony in progress. She said they would come looking any minute so we booked it. Within 10 minutes they were chasing us and had called her Mom to say she \"escaped\". They insisted her mom not let her in the house and said they would drive the almost 3 hours to our hometown to take her back if they had to. Her mom said that wouldn't be necessary but they wouldn't let up for weeks. \n\nCome to find out they would suspend anyone for saying the words \"Scientology\" or \"cult\". Suspension meant staying in your room and missing classes thus being forced to stay in the program longer. Most everyone who worked there had been in the program themselves and had chosen to live and work there with no salary. The program was written by L. Ron Hubbard and all proceeds go back to the church, however the websites don't link to each other at all. They also made those in the program stay in a sauna for 5+ hours a day for over a month while they \"detoxed\". They did some horrible things to her there and needless to say she was put off from rehabs for years. She struggled so much after the experience im convinced they made her addiction worse. She's been clean for 3 years now but this place was a nightmare. \n\nEDIT: we talked about this time in her life more after I showed her this post. I just learned so much more about her time there. The program works as a system of numbered levels. The first level is basically meditating while your partner degrades you. \"You're a worthless junkie nobody loves you\" etc. If you react you don't pass. Subsequent levels include the sauna + unhealthy amounts of vitamins, touching objects in a room to find \"meaning\" and learning to obey thoughtlessly. She was \"talked to\" numerous times for voicing her opinions on the program being Scientology. I just looked it up and now it seems as if Narconon is promoted openly by Scientology. Her time there was about 7 years ago so things have changed a bit. Same old cult tho. ",

Seriously.  \n\nTo the people who haven't seen this series and only know her as the wife from 'King of Queens' or the ex-scientologist who was probably nuts and also did that reality show with her family a couple years ago so she's just another hollywood wife, or whatever sort of impression you may have of her - it may seem silly to say she's a hero, but I **urge** you to watch at least two episodes of this series.  Hero almost seems like a modest descriptor.  And her partner in this project is Mike Rinder who was basically the equivalent of \"VP\" under Miscavige, and was in the upper echelon of the CoS for decades (20 years, if I remember correctly?)\n\n This is **not** a reality show.  This is a *very* well done docu-series that has gone more in-depth than any film or tv special has ever gone with this cult. \n\nRemini is absolutely relentless in her quest to expose all of the crimes this organization has committed, and in being the voice for the guests on her show who have left the church and are scared for their lives. \n\nShe's absolutely awe-inspiring.

There's even a high-ranking defector who explains just about everything they do behind closed doors.\n\nAnyway, it talks about how actors are especially prone to induction because of how necessary it is to network in that line of work. As soon as a couple big name actors join and make it public, tons of other actors flock to the doors. Then, since the cult is so tightly-knit and nepotistic, you actually see tangible benefits from following through with induction. \n\n",

I've also viewed a fair amount of interviews with defectors as well as full blown documentaries detailing the insanity of the cult. And yet, despite the overwhelming amount of evidence of their constant **highly** illegal and disturbing activities, they never seem to get a crackdown from the judicial system and the government.\n\nIf we can't protect our citizens from organized cults such as this, then what can we reasonably expect our society to be able to protect us from? It's not like Scientology are even attempting to hide their evil-doings, yet after several decades of their filth being blatantly shoved in our faces, we *still* can't seem to do anything.

And then the same recommendations in 1935, 1943, and 1965. And yet, here we are in 2020 with the same exact issues (if not even worse).\n\nWe've had so many chances to fix this and have given the same fixes each time. Each time, those in power either didn't do anything, made token changes to placate the masses, or just made things worse. We honestly shouldn't have to face this in 2020. This is an issue that kids should read about in history books as having been solved decades ago. But since this wasn't fixed back then, we need to make sure that we're not placated by meaningless token reforms this time so that kids 20 years from now can read about police brutality in history books instead of experiencing it first hand.",

My hope for the future is that BLM, antifa and these protests come out on the other side of history in glory, that there is no grey in their definitions and intentions.

Becomes you can only keep things penned up for so long, refuse to release the pressure, before things explode. This is what led to rioters throwing petrol bombs at police in Brixton, the UK, in the 80s and we got long, long, long overdue police reform, which while not perfect it is better. I can only say, the politicians at the heads of cities, states, and the country as a whole should be fucking thankful the protesters and the angered masses haven't gone and actually declared war on the police like they did in the UK of the 80s. If they continue to ignore the need to completely rejig the system and the fault of the police in the current moment, all I can say is I see a Brixton in Americas future.",

The city force was dissolved and replaced by a municipal force, in effect the city cops got put under county administration. This was done as a cost cutting measure by the former governor, as he deemed the city force too expensive to run for the results they were producing, and the union just refused to budge on anything.   \n\n\nThere was a short spike in crime following the dissolution as the municipal force got established, growing pains if you will. This has since been followed by a significant drop in crime, due in no small part to the municipal force having more manpower than the city force did. But also probably owed to the municipal force engaging in outreach programs aimed at building trust between officers and residents. Trust being a key word, and a major component in the protests against the police taking place now.",

Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound bombs (which the police referred to as \"entry devices\"[32]) made of FBI-supplied Tovex, a dynamite substitute, targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house.[30]\n\n&gt;The resulting explosions ignited a fire from fuel for a gasoline-powered generator stored in the rooftop bunker.[12] The fire spread and eventually destroyed approximately sixty-five nearby houses. Although firefighters had earlier drenched the building prior to the bombing, after the fire broke out, officials said they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters, so held them back.[30][33][34]\n\n&gt;Goode later testified at a 1996 trial that he had ordered the fire to be put out after the bunker had burned. Sambor said he received the order, but the fire commissioner testified that he did not receive the order.[35] Eleven people (John Africa, five other adults, and five children aged 7 to 13) died in the resulting fire. Ramona Africa, one of the two MOVE survivors from the house, said that police fired at those trying to escape.\"\n\n\n\n\nGoddamn. I remember seeing that title in a Leftover Crack song, but damn. I never knew all that. Fucking cops bombing neighborhoods in the 1980s! And they try to blame others for making people hate cops-- but they are the only ones that radicalized people against the cops.

Honestly every so often I will click a link like this and it will just totally affect my thinking.

She was a general in the civil war, she led a whole army and everything. She also never lost a passenger on her 'underground railroad'. To the point that she believed she was being led by god. I know a lot of people here don't believe-- but as someone who does, I can't help but agree with her. She was really a larger than life character no matter what way you cut it\n\nAnyways my point is I got so interested I never even replied to that post. S/he has no idea, but that obscure post totally changed the course of my thinking. The same is likely true for you, even if they didn't reply.

Even though there has definitely been a tipping point on the issue  of systemic racism and much more public support on the policing specifically, it is very hard for me to feel very hopeful or positive about this country. A giant part of the frustration and rage that I have is that, for generations, we've been saying the same thing about systemic racism and there has been video after video of in policing for years. I just can't get over the anger that I have been told isn't justified, and it's making it hard to appreciate all support that the (mostly white) public has extended now on the issue. I don't know how I can flip a switch like the rest of the country seems to have done from not caring or somehow being ignorant to marching alongside and publically supporting BLM.",

We succumb to our fear, and let hate spread like a virus.\n\nAny racist and unjust system in its nature undermines our constitutional creed of all men are created equal. \n\nWe can\u2019t let fear and hate divide us anymore. We must unite against racism, and let our love and understanding be the cure towards the racist virus.\n\nIf we failed to do so, such racist and unjust system will only  undermine our society, until one day it will lead to our own self-destruction from built up resentment and anger.\n\nNo Justice, No Peace!\n\nIn Unity There\u2019s Strength!",

I forget where I heard it but it was an answer to a question of why the post revolution US didn't devolve into the chaos and bloodshed revolutions tend to devolve into after the initial warring is done. It was because the institutions and power structure of the new nation didn't change much from the colonies. \n\nEssentially there was no power struggle because those in power before the revolution stayed in power after. They just put themselves at the head after getting rid of the king.",

                    "comment": "yeah i watched this episode in my office. i had to shut the door because i had tears running down my face while i let what she said sink in.\n\ni have gone through tremendous personal growth over the last 4 years. i was raised conservative, my parents weren't necessarily, explicitly racist, but had the typical fear of \"rough neighborhoods\" that your average middle-class white people in the South have. For years i was under the impression that liberals and Democrats were trying to dominate and control Americans, that being against military retribution somehow made you \"less patriotic,\" and that the flag and the military are to be respected at all times.\n\nSo when Trump came along in 2015-2016, i was all-in. I thought it was awesome that someone who \"didnt care about what people thought about him\" was running for president. I loved the Drain The Swamp narrative. I even posted in the_Donald some. But even before he was inaugurated, it became clear that he was already backing out of campaign promises. He was filling his cabinet with people that were unqualified, or worse, people who were easily bought.\n\nthen the antics only picked up. when he was running, so many Conservatives who were rubbed the wrong way by his tweets and comments were assured that it was only a charade to get himself in, and then it would calm down. it only increased. over the next year, watching this institution that i was told to respect, no matter what, turn into a global laughing stock started getting me to question my actual fundamental beliefs. I have adopted an approach of putting myself into people's shoes, and thinking about \"what if it was me? my wife? my kids? how would i react? how would i vote if this issue directly impacted my family?\" \n\nThis year in particular has really opened my eyes about what the priorities of the Republican party are, between COVID and the economy, and now this. During this, we have a President actively emulating the worst war criminal in history with his rhetoric, and the GOP and conservatives are completely ok with it.\n\nMy father literally said to me the other day that he would be voting for Trump again because the economy will be better. I asked how many people in Germany wished they wouldve listened to the rest of Hitler's ideologies instead of voting for just the parts where he promised the most prosperous version of Germany in history.\n\nand that brings me back to this woman in the video. that absolutely broke my heart. I've tried (at least i thought i was trying) for the last few years, to really tried to put myself in the shoes of folks affected by police brutality, but this is what finally broke me. ive been angry for the last 2 weeks, but now im just sitting here, trying to not cry again as i try to finish this comment, wondering how we got here. how have we let this go on for so long? i was taught the Civil Rights Movement was the end of it, but here we sit in 2020 with the only change being that Jim Crow laws and segregation laws don't \"officially\" exist anymore. Im sitting here broken hearted over the clear and obvious fact that the America i was raised to believe in, not only doesnt exist, but never did.\n\nI would ask for patience with white people who still don't get it, but i don't understand how anyone with eyes and compassion could get to where we are now, the absolute climax of racial protesting in this country, and not see it. at this point, if you can't listen to these people, and hear their stories, and hear their anger, and hear their pleas, then you are making a conscious choice to ignore it. You will be on the wrong side of history if you don't make a conscious effort to be compassionate and open your heart to a group of people who have suffered for 400 years.",

We had a guy who was a sheriff's deputy who lived in the community and every now and then, I'd let him come out with his son and hit balls and even play on one of the courses if it wasn't too busy. One day he asks if I want to go on a ride along one night. I say sure. \n\nSo the night comes up and I meet him at the station and he gives me the tour and goes over procedures and off we go. I live in one of the biggest cities in the country and he says we're going to patrol one of the interstates looking for anyone who might be trafficking narcotics. I'll preface this by saying that I'm an upper middle class, middle aged, white dude who lives in an upper middle class suburban community, but I'm also pretty liberal. The deputy wasn't aware of this last part.\n\nAs we're driving up and down the interstate, he explains the things he's looking for. Pro tip, if you're driving and a cop pulls along side of you and you don't want him to be suspicious, make eye contact with him and give a nod or something. He noted that anyone who doesn't acknowledge is nervous about something. He knows that you know he pulled along side of you and is maintaining driving along side of you. Back to the story. One thing they're looking for, trailers. We pulled over a truck pulling a horse trailer (older white woman, issued warning) and two U-Hauls (one younger white dude, ticket for speeding and one Hispanic couple issued warning). However, the bulk of our evening was spent pulling over black males. If we saw a black dude, any black dude, we would look for anything we might be able to pull them over for. He didn't say this, but I noticed it. Then we saw two black dudes driving a late model Lexus and that's when he said \"this is what you really need to be on the look out for.\" I didn't say anything but I can't adequately describe the look on my face. It was probably a cross between the look one would get when you have to take a violent shit and there's no toilet around and the look you might give if you ever saw a dog jumping rope. \n\nThis went on all night. The vast majority of people we pulled over were black men. We probably gave out warnings 90% of the time. He was looking to find drugs not issue tickets. I'd like to point out two things. The deputy was African American. All I kept thinking was just because I'm white and well off don't assume I'm cool with this and also, bro, these are your own people. He obviously didn't see it that way and that is an entirely different discussion. The other thing I'd like to point out is that ironically, the only arrest we made was two young, poor white kids who looked like they were living out of their POS car for having some weed, probably enough to roll 2 or 3 joints. \n\nAnyway, that was my experience. It was mostly boring and I actually fell asleep while he booked the kids. I wouldn't really be interested in doing it again, but if you ever get the chance, it can be enlightening.",

I usually applied it with the janitor or security etc, just look them in the eye , nod and smile. they will appreciate the recognition, because mostly people just pass them without acknowledging their existence.",

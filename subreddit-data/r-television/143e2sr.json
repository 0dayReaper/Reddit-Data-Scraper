It's apparently based on plans and scraps and conversations that Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett had before Terry's death, that were for a second book which they never got to make. \n\nThis is going to be new material we've never seen before, some of it from Terry Pratchett posthumously too.",

Or was he responding specifically to the people saying that those changes were only there for woke representation?  It might help to know the exact situation here where you think Neil Gaiman accused you of being some kind of bigot.\n\n&gt; I mean, like I already asked, why didn't he envision a diverse cast of characters in terms of gender and ethnicity back when he wrote it?\n\nEver think that maybe when he wrote these characters, he didn't think their identities were that strictly tied to their race or gender?\n\nAnd again I can't stress this enough, Gaiman is the creator.  It's like you're trying to tell the guy who wrote this in the first place that he's wrong about his own characters.",

Unable to sleep at night due to jet lag, and not having anything else to talk about, they started plotting out the sequel to Good Omens.[13] 668\u2014The Neighbour of the Beast was slated as the sequel's title, but after Gaiman moved to the United States, Pratchett expressed doubt that a sequel would be written.[8] Gaiman later affirmed this in one of his essays, titled Terry Pratchett: An Appreciation. Pratchett died in 2015. In 2017, Gaiman revealed \u2013 as part of the filming of the television series based on the book \u2013 that he and Pratchett had done some plotting for the sequel, including that \"[t]here would have been a lot of angels in the sequel\", one of whom was Gabriel, who was only briefly mentioned in Good Omens but was to figure more prominently in the television series.[14] When asked if Neil had any plans on releasing a sequel to Good Omens or maintaining its status as a standalone work, Gaiman stated that there was a plot for one that Pratchett wanted to be told, but that whether or not it would be made would depend on certain factors.[15]",

Avoid totally red, blue and purple ties, the goal is to look apolitical, neutral, nonpartisan yet professional. Black or charcoal suits for men...females should wear yellow, gold, magenta, cyan, but avoid red, blue or purple.\"\n\n&gt;At the end of the promo, viewers are encouraged to send in feedback \"if you believe our coverage is unfair.\"\n\n&gt;The instructions say that \"corporate will monitor the comments and send replies to your audience on your behalf.\"\n\n&gt;In other words, local stations are cut out of the interactions with viewers. Management will handle it instead.\n\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2018/03/07/media/sinclair-broadcasting-promos-media-bashing/index.html",

A lot of the individual corporations that are involved in media are actually owned by multinationals involved in manufacturing or finance. And if not outright owned they might as well be considering they can't survive without advertising. \n\nSurprise surprise, who do you think advertises the most on the big news channels? \n\nHint: it ain't mom and pop. It's exxon or some shit. \n\nThe result of this is that the only narrative that exists in the mainstream media is one that is at the very best uncontroversial as far as wall street is concerned. Even the \"progressive\" outlets stop short of saying anything potentially harmful to their advertisers or owners political interests. \n\nZoom out a little and the same corporations that exert all this influence on the media also exert this influence on the government via lobbying, campaign contributions, funding of civil society orgs, think tanks, or simply because they're big enough that going against them means risking an economic crisis (the old \"too big to fail\" schtick)\n\nIn practice the same people controlling the political direction of the two major parties also control most of the media. And as time goes on they're only gobbling up more and more of the information landscape. \n\nThe news in this country is propaganda. Granted, there's no such thing as truly unbiased news *anywhere*, but in America this gigantic web of connections between the private sector, media, and government has essentially made political progress impossible. If the public isn't uninformed (which it is) then it is being manipulated emotionally by political pundits and scripted content like this shit. If it isn't being manipulated it is being shut out of the political process through other means. \n\nWhenever somebody tells me \"the freer the market the freer the people\" all I have to do is look at what a complete and utter fucking lie our \"democracy\" is. If there's any argument against capitalism as a whole it is that this shit is even possible. The corporate sector in the US constitutes a government within the government, one that is totally unelected and is completely beyond the reach of law and democracy both. \n\nI don't care what people like Bernie Sanders say, there is *never* going to a time in this country when the two major parties start actually going after big business or putting the needs of the population over those of the rich. The system is rigged enough that most people don't even know how screwed they are, first of all. More than that the parties are financially dependent on the same people they're supposed to \"regulate\", and they've allowed these businesses to grow so big that even attempting to real them in is going to cause a fucking recession. \n\nThe thing that truly annoys me about modern America, the thing that makes me want to pour gasoline all over myself and light a match, is that this country is *clearly* not a democracy, our government *clearly* doesn't give a shit about us, our elections *clearly* are a rigged joke where the choice is wall street or wall street, and yet the American people keep buying into this meaningless, partisan, identitarian horseshit. At best they act like the organized theater that is our electoral system is somehow going to change the course of this. \n\nYou're fucked. \n\nI'm fucked. \n\nVoting won't help.\n\nBurn something. \n\nGet angry for once in your fucking lives you god damn lemmings\n\n/rant\n\nEdit: [Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJYXaS7J-Q)",

Maybe getting thousands of messages could raise awareness which is what needs to be done.

How can anyone hope to eliminate us? As long as this nation exists, so will we. Don't you know that our plans have your interests -not ours- in mind?\" The mapping of the human genome was completed early this century. As a result, the evolutionary log of the human race lay open to us. We started with genetic engineering, and in the end we succeeded in digitizing life itself. But there are things not covered by genetic information.\n\n&gt; Human memories, ideas. Cuture. History. Genes don't contain any record of human history. Is it something that should not be passed on? Should that information be left at the mercy of nature? We've always kept records of our lives. Through words, pictures, symbols... from tablets to books... But not all information was inherited by later generations. A small percentage of the world was selected and processed, then passed on. Not unlike genes, really.\n\n&gt; But in the current, digitized world, trivial information is accumulating every second, preserved in all its triteness. Never fading, always accessible. Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander... All this junk data preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate. It will only slow down social progress, reduce the rate of evolution. The digital society furthers human flaws and selectively rewards the development of half-truths.\n\n&gt; Just look at the strange juxtapositions of morality around you.\n\n&gt; Billions spent on new weapons in order to humanely murder other humans.\n\n&gt; Rights of criminals are given more respect than the privacy of their victims.\n\n&gt; Although there are people suffering in poverty, huge donations are made to protect endagered species.\n\n&gt; Everyone grows up being told the same thing: Be nice to other people... But beat out the competition. You're special. Believe in yourself and you will succeed. But it's obvious from the start that only few can succeed...\n\n&gt; You exercise your right to 'freedom' and this is the result. All rhetoric to avoid conflict and protect each other from hurt. The untested truths spun by different interests to churn and accumulate in the sandbox of political correctness and value systems. Everyone withdraws into their own small gated community, afraid of a larger forum. They stay inside their little ponds leaking whatever \"truth\" suits them into the growing cesspool of society at large. The different cardinal truths neither clash nor mesh. No one is invalidated, but nobody is right. Not even natural selection can take place here. The world is being engulfed in \"truth.\"\n\n&gt; And this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but with a whimper.\n\n\nc/o \"Colonel Campbell\" in Metal Gear Solid 2. Creepy, yet relevant?",

            "comment": "I worked at a Sinclair affiliate for about 6 months after college, and it was genuinely the worst job experience that I have ever had.\n\nThe work environment at this Sinclair affiliate station was totally hostile. I once witnessed a fist fight between a director and editor on the newsroom floor (neither of them were fired). After that, I realized that I had to get the hell out of there. This shitty post-college entry job wasn't worth the stress.\n\nI personally saw a lot of sexism directed towards female anchors. In general, most anchors hated reading the scripts that producers gave them. Most of the scripts were generated by inexperienced recent college graduates, and were essentially just typo-filled summaries of AP newswire bulletins, or directives from Sinclair corporate itself. The highest paid employees at the station were the male and female lead anchors, between commercial breaks they would incessantly rant about conservative bullshit, quote anchorman, or quote \"fuck it let's do it live\" from Bill O's meltdown. As a lowly paid employee you couldn't do shit about it, because they ran the show and would just talk over you.\n\nWhen I announced that I had found a new job, I received no congratulations from anyone, and my supervisors treated me like I was completely fucking them over even though I wasn't even paid a living wage. Most people working on the production side of things were working multiple jobs to care for their families.\n\nI truly believe that you're better off working at a McDonald's than working for an affiliate station owned by Sinclair.",

Teach him about nuance. It's totally fine to like Logan Paul, but understand why people are upset with his suicide forest antics.  You can be a fan of someone and not be a fan of their behavior. Don't fall into the cult of a personality. ",

They did it again with \"San Junipero\", this time examining the positives that could come about if such a technology were to exist. If we're just talking AI copies of another person's consciousness and not the specific \"cookie\" tech, throw in \"Be Right Back\", which examines the damage that that technology could cause at a more personal level than\" White Christmas\"\n\nI was generally entertained by the episodes that featured AI copies in season 4, but I don't think they really brought anything new to the table. Devoting so much time to an idea that had been throughly explored already made the season feel less vital and interesting than previous seasons. As such, making it the primary theme explored that season was a mistake, at least in my opinion",

Like a Twilight Zone for our time.\n\nAnd most seasons delievered that for me, some more so then others. But the last season i did not get that feeling at all. Not one single episode felt like a Distopian future.

It pretty much introduces the shows mentality and eases you in to the futuristic technological aspect of it. I can\u2019t imagine being as overtly interested if the show had started with the entire history of you, and 15 million merits was definitely gonna be kind of a hard sell for the general public as the shows first offering (although I do understand that brits have different taste, that episode works perfectly as the opposite-spectrum second episode to the national anthem). But yeah, going into it with no knowledge of the show at all, the whole pig fucking thing can be a little abrasive. But either way, I wouldn\u2019t call it a bad decision at all unless you started with season 3 and then went back to it lol.",

Was just a scene of me coming out of a forest path onto a more open park area, with a University in the far distance. The scene is at night and the path slopes downwards to the park below, with several tennis courts next to each other each with a fairly tall metal fence. \n\nThe courts have large spotlights and students walk about and sit socialising as its a nice night. But there was also several 20 foot robots similar to those weird alien like robots from Half Life, each with large spotlights on their heads scanning the park. They had a Art Deco vibe to them.\n\nThese robots/ aliens are controlling the planet, but unlike most films where the scene is bleak, people have become normalised to it, like it's just a part of every day life (as being controlled and monitored is not really all that new).\n\nTheir job was to spot people running, as for some reason that is banned in this reality, as running was the only logical way in which these robots can be stopped. Not in a literal sense as if running just makes them collapse, but as their minds are extremely logical, they have created a scenario in which they only need to move at certain speed and have a certain number of them dotted around the world at any given time so long as the human remain under a certain travelling threshold. Running interferes with this algorithmic calculation, and so is forbidden. \n\nWithout humans being any to move faster than walking pace, they can't carry out the necessary methods to deliver the needed equipment and intel fast enough to block the alien/ robots communications. \n\nSo the protagonists are knows as \"Sprinters\", those who literally sprint as their rebellious act, one which, if spotted would result in the robots running after them. They have no guns, just the spotlight, which becomes the weapon by increasing in brightness until it blinds and cooks them up close. The sprinters are often \"marked\" and known by the robots, and so simply walking through the park is a dangerous task, avoiding the spotlights of the robots. Was a strange seeing seeing easy going students amidst this quite tense moment of traveling through the social park, where the spinners hide amongst them heading towards the university. \n\nThe dream ended there, but it felt like they were there to meet someone important. \n\nThe pacing felt slow and dream-like, similar to The Warriors movie. Calm yet tense, if that made sense. Oddity in the stillness of the night.",

That was part of why I liked the show so much. \n\nI think the biggest problem with them trying to put the episodes in the same universe is, some of them just don't fit unless you're going to say there were massive leaps in time. Just this season, the episode with the robot dogs, how is that going on at the same time as any of the other episodes this season. \n\nAnd if you go back, the episode where they pedal the bikes to get fake money to do stuff with their avatars, that just doesn't seem like a scenario you could fit into the grand scheme of a single universe.

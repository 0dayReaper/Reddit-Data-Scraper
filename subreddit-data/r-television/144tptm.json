Watched it every week those first 3 seasons.\n\nI saw they are bringing it back. No interest at this point, honestly.\n\nBut seeing early Kristin Wiig and David Hornsby is classic. Natasha  Leggero and Jon Huertas, too. So many people who are now familiar names. It's wild who was in those casts! And of course... Lorenzo Lamas \ud83d\ude02\n\nI once met Fred Cross, who was the ventriloquist/interpreter in season... 2? He was doing a special effect show at Universal Studios in Hollywood. We sat down and he came out as the host. I was nearly 40yrs old jumping out of my seat with excitement. He did photo ops with a prop as people were walking out and I told him I loved him in Joe Schmo. He laughed and gave me a big hug. Told me I was the only person who had ever recognized him from that! This was years later, but he was surprised and grateful for the praise, told me how much fun it was, etc.  -- actually had me wait aside to take the last 2 people so he could chat with me more about it. Couldn't have been nicer.",

Denpa Sh\u014dnen (January 1998 \u2013 March 2002), a Japanese reality-television show on Nippon Television, after winning a lottery for a \"show business related job\". He was challenged to enter mail-in sweepstakes until he won \u00a51 million (about $8,000) in total. He started with nothing (including no clothes), was cut off from outside communication and broadcasting, and had nothing to keep him company except the magazines he combed through for sweepstakes entry forms. After spending 335 days to reach his target, he set the Guinness world record for the \"longest time survived on competition winnings\".[2]\n&gt;\n&gt; Hamatsu lived in front of the camera, with only the possessions he won via the sweepstakes (save for basic utilities such as running water, heating and electricity), and the stacks of postcards and magazines required for entering the sweepstakes. Due to his nudity, an eggplant cartoon graphic covered his genitals when Hamatsu was standing on camera. Nasubi is the Japanese word for \"eggplant\"; the nickname was chosen due to his 30 cm long face that was said to be shaped like a Japanese eggplant, as well as the producers having to cover his genitals with an animated eggplant for the television audience. Hamatsu believed that he was being recorded and the show would be re-broadcast later once the footage had been gathered. In reality, the experiment was being live-streamed, with footage compiled and re-aired each week, complete with sound effects present at frequent intervals, using new tech to have 24/7 television to show him live using a joystick to cover up his genitals.",

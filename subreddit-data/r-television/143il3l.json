Yeah, it's been told to death elsewhere and I recommend the Dark Side of the Ring episode, but it's one of the defining moments of his entire life. Vince cheaped out on the rigging equipment, using a latch meant for sailboats, which opened too early and lead to his death. All for a stupid comedy gimmick that most people didn't care about, especially since Owen was one of the best technical wrestlers ever.\n\nThen he continued the show, which would only happen in wrestling as the Damar Hamlin situation proved years later, and he didn't even have the courtesy to swap the canvas. This meant that not only did his employees have to watch one of their friends and co-workers die, but they had to continue the show and take bumps on a mat that was still covered with his blood. From the beginning, the series on Vince was targeted towards Behind the Bastards fans, many of whom were non-wrestling fans, so I think it's surprising they only talked about Owen at the end.\n\nBut I hope they return to Vince in the future. There's quite a lot of shit he pulled in the 2000s and 2010s. I don't even think they even touched Benoit. Benoit, the Plane Ride from Hell, the CM Punk lawsuit, the Saudi Arabia contract, the lawsuits against him by several wrestlers and/or their widows, Linda's senate campaign and how it coincided with WWE's shift towards PG rated programming. All sorts of things. There could easily be another couple episodes dealing with the recent history.",

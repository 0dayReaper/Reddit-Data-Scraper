Their end will correspond to their deeds.",

So many pastors try to stay out of politics because they don\u2019t want to lose half their congregation with one risky statement.\n\nI think another reason people don\u2019t speak up is the social stigma associated with being a liberal Christian. Christians grow up associating themselves with the Republican party. When I finally figured out the con that republicans were playing, it took me forever to process it. And I was scared of what other people would think of me. It\u2019s really a tricky situation to navigate because you risk losing the respect of your peers. That obviously doesn\u2019t make it right \u2014 I\u2019m just explaining the mindset that someone goes through. It takes time for a lot of people to be confident enough in their new beliefs to be able to speak up.",

No matter what nasty and horrible things he said she ignored it and just kept asking if he was hurt, did he know where a shelter was, etc.\n\nShe died at 24 from leukemia and these guys live forever.  \n\nThey tell me if I don't go to church I'll go to hell.

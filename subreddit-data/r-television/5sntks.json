This is why we can't have nice things.\n\n**Reminder:** As mentioned by our venerable mod /u/brtw [earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5slr9d/a_friendly_message_from_your_television_moderator/), r/television is a place to discuss TV shows and the business around it. Sometimes politics and entertainment mix, and that's fine. Political discussion is allowed so long as it remains civil, however if you are only here to discuss politics, to start fights based on your political alignment, action will be taken and you will be banned.

Trump could have easily gone with something like \"I know I'm a tough act to follow, but Arnie's doing a great job. It's a wonderful show, not as good as it was with me, but still really great. Go and watch it, you'll love it.\" \n\nInstead he went on about how \"the ratings went right down the tubes\" under Schwarzenegger and how \"it\u2019s been a total disaster\". Way to promote the product you're involved with, but apparently Trump prefers making himself bigger by pushing others down. I guess it makes sense in his zero-sum worldview: He seems to believe that he can only win if someone else loses.\n\nOf course, all of that's beside the point, really, because the elephant in the room is: Why in the world is the POTUS spending his time ranting about TV show ratings and why is he still an executive producer on a reality TV show?",

Trump picking out decorations and planning his galas and rallies, Bannon popping in with \"sign this, dear\" and a kiss. Trump up late in the President's Bedroom, applying his tanning oil in his bathrobe, when Bannon comes in late and drunk, and they inevitably argue: \"What kind of an hour do you call this?\"",

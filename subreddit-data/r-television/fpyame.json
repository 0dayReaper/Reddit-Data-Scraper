They said they could buy him another year but they would have to break his pelvis to get to it, and I didnt want him to go through all of that pain and misery just so I could have him for another year.

Not my dog but my father had leukemia in 1991 and after a year and a bit in the hospital he was released on remission only to get it again 10 years later in 2001. After a stem cell transplant he was released again on remition eventually only to get colon cancer in 2007. They did an operation and he survived that only to get pancreatic cancer 4 years later. That was his death sentance. Because he beat it three times before he was in denial that it would kill him and never left a will or his passwords to any of his stuff and the past 3 and a half years has been a mess for my mom trying to get everything sorted out.\n\nNow my six year old doberman has lumps and I'm worried that it's something becsuse I'm a bit leery about shit like that having have lived my entire life from 10 yesrs old on constantly having it on my mind...",

Unfortunately pure breed dogs tend to be at higher risk for developing cancer, but they also commonly have fat deposits like you said.\n\nIf you notice lumps on your pet, you're doing a good job of looking after them.

Oh just to add info. My dog with the fat deposit is some sort of husky/German shep/shiba/border collie. I need to get around to getting a DNA test. He's getting older and I want all the info possible to make his life the best life possible. We love our dogs so much we moved to a place with a ton of land and forest. Its heaven on earth for dogs.

Funny how the working breeds and the mutts are almost always healthier from birth than the \"decorative\" breeds. Some short nosed dogs have to have surgery in the first months of life because they have so much extra skin in their face they can't breathe. They literally have to carve out a tunnel for air to pass through their meat flaps. Humans are horrible sometimes.\n\nAnyways, thanks for what you and you SO do, it's tough working at a vet and mostly dealing with animals who aren't doing very well.",

We went to a different vet for a second opinion on the price. The vet looked right past the skin tag and said that her belly looked swollen. Took an ultrasound. Tumor on the spleen. \u201cOh it\u2019s not cancerous there\u2019s no need for a screening\u201d. Fuck a screening, this other vet found it just by looking. I just want to cry but I feel too weak.",

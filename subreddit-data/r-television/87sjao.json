He isn't fantastic at his job, but gets it done. He has a daughter, a fiance, and he plays in a band. He is simple, but not stupid.\n\nFast-forward to season 9...\n\nKevin is AN ABSOLUTE MORON. He's drinking \"chunky lemon milk\", can't count for shit, he has a hard time putting together a sentence, and there's the whole fucking turtle scene where for weeks he doesn't realize he gluing the shell of a clearly dead turtle back together. They managed to turn Kevin from a lazy sweetheart into a bumbling idiot.\n\nI think the catalyst for that gradual change before going full blown retard was when Dwight convinced Holly that Kevin was retarded. The writers had to up the stupid for Kevin and they never really ratcheted it back down to it's previous level.\n\nThe same can be said for Toby. \n\nFrom seasons 1-7 Toby was milquetoast and quiet, and needs to uphold the ethics of the workplace much to Michael's chagrin. We only really hate Toby through Michael because they are constantly at odds with each other. Before Michael left, you kind of felt bad for Toby.\n\nWell, after Michael left, they needed to *make him hateable*. His boringness became aggressive. Constantly talking about his book, and the Scranton Strangler. He seemed to push everyone away from him. Nobody in the office could stand him anymore. He was constantly being shit on. Even the audience hated him.\n\nAll in all the writing just got lazy, so they only focused on a couple characteristics of some of the characters, leading to the flanderization.\n\n",

            "comment": "Dwight finds success as the guitarist of a German metal band, Angela has become the ultimate roadie, and together they have Phillip and a four year old daughter named Gertrude, whom they refer to as Gertie. The band has been touring Eastern Europe, but Angela convinced him its time to go back to the farm and provide the kids with the stability of living in one place and attending school, as Gertie will soon be ready for kindergarten. \n\nMichael &amp; Holly, and their four kids, move back to Pennsylvania after the death of her parents, and Michael finds himself, once again, the manager of Dunder Mifflin. The paper business is being reborn, driven by folks once again buying books and other paper goods. Michael finds himself drawn to hipsters but unable to truly understand them.\n\nAfter living in Austin &amp; enjoying the explosive success of their business, Jim is ready to go to the next level. He decides to pursue his MBA and has been accepted to Villanova, where he plans to take classes online. Pam has been working on a series of children\u2019s books, and Michael pursues her publisher in attempt to gain their paper business. \n\nStanley, after a brief retirement, finds himself looking for work after losing his beachside home to a hurricane. Phyllis, in contact with him after the devastating storm, mentions DM is looking for salesmen.ise\n\nKelly has found a surprising amount of success as a lifestyle blogger. Ryan, having left her stranded on a beach in Thailand, has been up to his old tricks. Old habits die hard, though, and he finds he misses Kelly terribly. Instead of contacting her to patch things up, he starts his own travel &amp; leisure blog to document his life journey, but never actually leaves his apartment.\n\n\nAndy has been on staff at Cornell but decides he really wants to be a motivational speaker. He starts a \u201ctraining program\u201d that encourages participants to enroll for online courses and purchase his ebooks. His business is t doing well, so he starts hitting up his former DM coworkers. Andy attempts to recruit Michael, who has ideas of his own. Michael insists his program is a failure because people want to be able to attend classes in person and use real books.",

    "postText": "This question popped in my head watching Manifest series and seeing how Vance played by Daryl Edwards is so fully human that steals my heart. But this may not be a good example, since he doesn't necessarily steal the spotlight, but there are other times when much smaller roles just take over the scene, and it's not necessarily just good acting but it's more, the character is written well and it just hits the spor for you. Anyways looking to hear yours, I will add more later myself",

Maggie Wheeler in Friends is also a great one.\n\nIf you mean characters that are in almost every episode but don't usually have the spotlight, Hitchcock and Scully on Brooklyn 99 are the best, with Pete from 30 Rock not far behind (also Dot Com and Grizz).",

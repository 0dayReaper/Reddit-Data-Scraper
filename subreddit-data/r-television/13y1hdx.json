Im one of, maybe the only people, who enjoyed the entire show. And I love House of Dragons. I dunno what the future will hold for the whole franchise but I hope Ill still enjoy it all.",

George seems to be suffering from writer\u2019s block of epic proportions, most likely due to the traumatizing negative fan reception towards the end. But even before the series was nearing its end, he was already screwed because he was a victim of success from the show. Expectations, hype, in the end he couldn\u2019t deliver. He needed a lot more time before giving his blessing to the production staff and HBO the go ahead.",

The books get increasingly complex and meandering as they progress (and much more thematic with less set pieces). This forced the writer to basically come up with their own plots in season 5 and only used the books as a rough outline \u2014 and we all know how that turned out.",

All of the writers grew up watching the show and Fox is no longer trying to get them to act like Family Guy, so yeah sometimes it hits. But there's been 700 episodes, the 705th just isn't going to be as good as the 53rd. To me, the show is like a long running comic strip. It's best days are behind it but I like the humor and characters and sometimes there's a good one.",

They understood that keeping people invested was the secret to all of their success.",

The first season of Heroes is perfect in this regard.  It all leads up to the plotlines and characters finally intersecting for a single scene of the last episode.  The Expanse doesn't have the three main plotlines intersect until the third season.  \n\nHalf the GoT characters never meet at all.  \n\nIs there any reason why a show should stick to just one plotline featuring all the characters?",

Very much standalone.\n\nThere are all sorts of plot lines - FGM, kidnapping, teenage pregnancy etc but two completely different soaps with no convergence/crossover of characters having a cancer storyline starting at the same time and ending with a character\u2019s death both in the same week just seems like someone has picked out some raffle tickets and said - Eastenders and Hollyoaks are running under 30, female cancer storylines ending in their deaths, and Coronation Street has a serial killer and Emmerdale has the hypochondriac mother-in-law fabricating illness to stop her son marrying his fianc\u00e9e.",

I'm glad that this storyline gives her a somewhat memorable send-off, and I don't want to imagine a version of the show that says \"wait no, 'Eastenders' is currently doing that, Niamh wants out of the show, we can only do the cancer storyline a year from now with someone else.\"\n\nI don't watch Eastenders and the tone doesn't speak to me. I don't watch Emmerdale either, but I somewhat follow it because it seems... different to Hollyoaks, and personally, whenever something interesting on Emmerdale happens, I think \"I would love to see how 'Hollyoaks' handles a similar situation in their own tone/style\" and vice versa.",

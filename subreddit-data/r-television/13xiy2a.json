When I stopped my cable TV several years ago, I transitioned to reading their website b/c it was pretty straightforward and they seemed to update things pretty quickly. I even had it bookmarked. It\u2019s been a couple of years since I un-bookmarked it though b/c something changed. I don\u2019t know if it was a change in me or if it was them, but I just did not like the way they were presenting the news and some of their presenters were starting to get on my nerves like Sanjay Gupta. The only time I check CNN nowadays is for a really big event, and that\u2019s only as a supplemental source. Otherwise, I vary my news consumption between multiple different sources.",

I even interned for CNN in a satellite office filled with Pulitzer-nominated/winning pitbull investigative journalists. First \u201creal\u201d journalism experience for me other than my college newspaper. \n\nCNN did NOT fuck around. They shoveled resources into their news division, because they understood that real journalism takes real human manpower to do properly. \n\nIt regularly scooped even local and regional news organizations. (Especially in the mid-90s, for example, the [*first* bombing of the Twin Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing) in 1993, the [1995 Oklahoma City](https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=OK026) terror bombing, and the 1998 bombing of the [American Embassy in Nairobi](https://www.state.gov/24th-anniversary-of-the-1998-embassy-bombings/), among others.) \n\nI\u2019d help edit breaking news copy literally as it was being written and sent to the anchors to read live on-air. If any journalist got a fact wrong and didn\u2019t have an ironclad reason for the error making it all the way through their rigorous fact-checking process and ending up on-air and/or published, they\u2019d be unceremoniously fired on the spot. \n\nNo kidding, it was brutal. \n\nAlmost no news organization operates this way anymore. They have been eviscerated by short-sighted, quarterly profit-driven corporate overlords. \n\nEditors are overworked or nonexistent, in-house fact-checkers and ombudsman are nearly nonexistent, investigative units have been purged to save costs, journalists are overworked and underpaid and their work has been commodified into word counts and \u201cviews,\u201d and newsworthiness is too often dictated by its potential to drive website traffic rather than ACTUAL news value.",

The 11th Hour is good but I miss Brian Williams and Rachel Maddow was good to because she was like a tiny NPR capsule there with focus on reporting these very specific tiny things happening. She would take time to setup the piece and then talk about it at length. Maybe that's why she was so popular. But yeah, I need NPR on TV (not really PBS) in which all days is news reporting but it's so different and with so much to listen that no show is equal. Plus you have these shows like 1A and The Takeaway that do report on news but focus on one specific subject and talk about it in length. I miss that",

The one thing I've learned the most in the last 20 years are starting to notice this crap, is that the media has absolutely perfected pitting one side against the other, no matter what the topic.

Once the year was up, I returned the system and have stuck with watching or downloading everything online.  \n\nSadly, the quality of everything coming out from Hollywood has been overwhelmingly bad that my watching experience has taken a nosedive over the years and have been resorting to either watch older stuff, foreign stuff, or just reading online novels.",

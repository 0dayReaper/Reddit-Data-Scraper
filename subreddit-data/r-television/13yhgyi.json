An unhappy group of dysfunctional wankers is now one of the most successful teams in Europe, and a family to boot.\n\nBut the problem this season is the writing is all over the place. Character arcs often go backward (with the exception of maybe Rebecca and Jamie), get overextended (Keeley) or are barely mentioned (Nate). And Ted is just stuck? The therapist stuff just ended? He's hiring PIs to investigate his ex-wife? Tf???\n\nAnd many of the characters are barely themselves. They're just their own mini Ted Lassos, ripping off one-liners and pop culture references and nodding affirmations. So basically Jason just created a bunch of Sudekis's. It's rough.",

                                    "comment": "Yeah I feel like the general vibe of \"they don't need Ted anymore\" was a very sensible direction for the show to take as he departs, showing that he created an impact and made their lives better and that they don't need him.\n\n\nBut the execution felt *bizarre. *  They just kinda separated Ted from all the major plotlines and mad him feel more vestigial than anything. It almost felt cynical in how no one seemed to give a shit about him or what he was going through until he was leaving.\n\n\nAnd then they just present it in a way where he feels tragic.  Ted seems notably *worse* off at the end.  I get a lot of the focus was on his therapy and learning to honestly connect with negative feelings instead of \"toxic positivity\" but in every way his life just seems shittier.  His character as performed seems hollowed out and bored.  He's built this beautiful community that he no longer gets to be a part of (including losing Beard).  Basically, all he gets is to be geographically nearer to his son (which was the state of affairs before the show even started) and his shitbag ex.  He doesn't even look happy at the end.\n\n\nAlso what the Hell was up with Roy and Keely's breakup?  Happens off screen and we never get a firm reasoning for it.  Then Roy just never get over her and wants her back, but then Jaime gets all serious about it at the end and no resolution.  Like exploring that further felt lower priority than \"Jack?\"",

Nate feeling bad about Rupert wanting him to cheat falls flat because the audience is fully aware that Rupert is a mean cheater, we are not surprised so we cannot share the revelation.\n\nWe could feel sympathy for Nate if he'd been deceived by Rupert, and the show sort of tries to float that idea. But it falls flat, because Nate was such an asshole in S2 and early S3. We do not understand their relationship as one based on deception, we understand it as based on both being bad!\n\nSo this whole incident is reflective of why people didn't like the so-called Nate \"redemption\" arc. It really does feel like a retcon.",

I get a lot of the focus was on his therapy and learning to honestly connect with negative feelings instead of \"toxic positivity\" but in every way his life just seems shittier.  His character as performed seems hollowed out and bored.  He's built this beautiful community that he no longer gets to be a part of (including losing Beard).  Basically, all he gets is to be geographically nearer to his son (which was the state of affairs before the show even started) and *his shitbag ex*. He doesn't even look happy at the end.\n\nWithout trying to spoil it. \n\n&gt;!all three coaches end the finale in toxic relationships. Beard literally marries an abusive partner. Roy is in some sort of undefined relationship with Keeley, rather than being in a healthy relationship with Phoebe\u2019s teacher. And they heavily suggest Ted\u2019s ex is over her couples therapy boyfriend and her and Ted may be getting back together in the end.!&lt;\n\nThey deliberately left pretty much every relationship in a cliffhanger so that fans can have a \u201cchoose your own relationship\u201d ending. The only 100% resolved relationship is Beard\u2019s &gt;!but WTF with Ted not being there!&lt;",

The writers learn how to pace everything by sticking to a fixed running time. When you suddenly change to extra long episodes, everything suffers.\n\nIt's similar to why 'movies' of shows are usually nowhere near as good as the show itself, the script has a different rhythm that they can't quite figure out.",

These actions that would have caused 3 episodes of drama in season 1 became a 10-minute subplot in season 3.  They\u2019re not perfect yet, but they\u2019re better versions of themselves.",

What happened to the confident Evil Nate we saw at the end of SE2?  It seems like his natural character arc should have been to fight Rupert not slink away.  In fact I felt like that was the ending they originally planned, with Rupert pushing Coach Nate on the side of the pitch and Nate decking him.

His arc was always about his relationship with himself and how that was the only real obstacle he ever had to his happiness. The rest was just the lens we viewed that relationship through. His scene with his father is just a final push so he can forgive himself. His father isn't telling him that so that Nate forgives him. He's telling Nate that so Nate can learn to separate his relationship with himself from the expectations others put on him.\n\nI think people are just mad that these characters who have put in 3 seasons of work into being better people actually managed meaningful change once they found and addressed their real shortcomings. They just wanted some people to be bad guys and can't accept that relationships aren't actually that hard to mend when everyone involved is trying to be the best versions of themselves.\n\nI don't even think they are right when they say this article was Nick Mohammed shading Jason Sudeikis for his choices in the scene and what he said was fully accomplished.

            "comment": "I love the show, but season three was the weakest and went out with a whisper instead of a cheer.\n\n* Nate's redemption arc wasn't much of a redemption arc. It really felt stuffed in, like everyone just said \"Ah, he's back. Okay,\" rather than showing any sort of betrayal that the audience felt at the end of S2. Look at how Sam reacted to Ted in S2 when he thought Ted was bringing Jamie back - where is that kind of anger and disappointment? Jamie was a borrowed player, Nate was part of the club and abandoned them.\n   * Everything just kind of got swept under the rug with his father, too, after two seasons of constantly seeming like a disappointment.\n* Zava. Why? It felt like they had a storyline in place, shot most of it, and then something fell through and they abandoned it and wrote him off - almost like the actor was in legal trouble and suddenly couldn't shoot anymore scenes. It felt like filler in a season where they'd already doubled the length of all of the episodes, and - as much as I love the show - I don't think longer episodes were necessary.\n* Keeley. I love Keeley. I really do. But this season felt like she was tacked on simply for fan service. She had no connection to the club anymore, nothing she did related to the club, and it felt like we were watching a spin-off in-between scenes of the core show.\n* Ted. As a lot of people pointed out, we went from him hiring someone to snoop on his ex-wife ~~- who lives in another country -~~ to having some sort of optimistic reunion just a few episodes later. Notably, the last time we see ex-wife's new boyfriend, he's being obnoxious, and he's conveniently not shown when Ted arrives to see his son. I personally felt like they toyed with her breaking up with the boyfriend (hence those scenes - him being obnoxious and him being absent), but then decided to leave that on the cutting room floor so that it wasn't as in-your-face with its optimism.",

They then created a character based off two existing, incredible, soccer players that were drama queens and had left teams early in dramatic fashion. \n\nIn soccer, teams have to basically be competitive all year, the entire year, every match, to even have a shot at winning the league. There wasn't a great way to set up a scenario in which the team had struggles to overcome and was still in a position to \"win the whole damn thing.\"",

Ultimately, he chose to forgive, just like he chose to forgive Beard.

Part of the new strategy  is that every player is important - which is sort of Ted's philosophy as a person - like you see him walking through the village and he knows everybody important or humble\n\n4. In a more abstract sense, you can see the Zava storyline as a being a comment by the SHOW about itself, rejecting the idea of being a star vehicle for Sudekis where he would be in every scene and instead being an ensemble where a wide variety of characters are developed as full fledged people.",

He had a brilliant scene in S2 when he said that he earned his place as coach and told Ted Lasso that he belonged back in America. That should\u2019ve been the point of no return for Nathan\u2019s character. But then the very next time they meet, its in the elevator and he goes back to being a nervous/shy kid and wants to apologize. What brought this up? No idea. And then later he decides to not cheat on his girlfriend and I guess that was a turning point for redemption??? I just don\u2019t get it",

His turning point wasn\u2019t not cheating on his girlfriend, it was leaving Rupert behind and choosing his own way. \n\nNate\u2019s heel turn started in season 1, manifested in season 2 and resolved in season 3 - and it was pretty clear this would be the end result at the end of season 2 given the themes of the show. I\u2019m confused by people acting like it was quick when he was pretty clearly a fish out of water in every episode of season 3 with west ham.",

And by the time Nate apologizes it's an afterthought, as he's already been welcomed back to Richmond with open arms, and Ted never seemed anything but completely okay with that. \n\n\nAnother theme of this season was that Ted's toxic positivity is killing him because he needs to own when he's hurt or when he's unhappy with people. They just drop that one entirely outside of him yelling at his mother. \n\n\nI guess it just doesn't feel especially powerful to me.  From a drama perspective, \"forgiveness can just be given\" feels indistinguishable from just dropping a plot point when you no longer feel like pursuing it. \"Character stabs protagonist in the back in incredibly hurtful way, protagonist never really gives a fuck either way\" just isn't a very interesting story to me.",

Ted's entire conversation with Beard that led to Beard inviting Nate back to AFC Richmond was Ted making the decision to forgive Nate. Beard absolutely hated Nate at this point, but Ted convinced him to just forgive Nate, just like Ted forgave Beard.\n\nI'm sorry it didn't land for you, but it absolutely landed for me. The Beard backstory especially drove the point home, as well as Ted's conversation with Jamie about his dad. Like I said, the scenes with Ted and Beard, and Ted with Nate, are some of my favorite in the show.\n\nAt the end of the day, it might just come down to how you feel about Ted's thesis on life about whether or not forgiveness needs to be earned.",

That's a big contradiction from the S2 plotline.\n\nIt doesn't have much impact when everyone forgives Nate, because S3 Nate is pretty much a saint.",

That scene is probably most known for the pose Rebecca reveals, but it also includes the line \"You deserve whatever you want.\" That never sat well with me because I think it converts the optimistic/positive theme of the show to unlimited privilege. It's essentially saying everything you want is yours to take, no matter what you have to do to get it or how those actions affect others. Doubly concerning because it comes from a multi-millionaire whose initial solution to Nate's table problem is to buy the restaurant. It's essentially Rupert's mantra.\n\nThat outlook is great if you're an empathetic, well-adjusted, humble, emotionally mature person. But for most of us, it leads to what happens to Nate: we take it too far. Not only does he end up convincing himself he deserves that table at A Taste of Athens (yay!), but it starts a process that leads to him thinking he deserves all the credit for the team's success. The natural results are resentment toward Ted and Nate's...strained departure.\n\nThe most empowering idea in the show eventually leads to some of the most toxic/hurtful behavior. It's a neat way to show that no idea is perfect, that restraint and perspective are needed even with the most positive and well-intended advice.\n\nIf that was the intent of the writers, I think it's the cleverest thing they did in the show.",

A majority of the episodes easily rank amongst the ones I hated the most (god I despised both S3E5 and S3E8).\n\nEpisodes were way too long, yet the plot progressed way too slow. Characters such as Keeley and Nate went through some of the weakest plotlines i've seen in a while, made even worse by the fact that they were highlights in S1 and 2.\n\nWay too much time was spent on poor plotlines revolving around Keeley and Jack, also the whole West Ham arc which both showed too much we didn't care about, and left out some pretty important moments at the same time &gt;!(why didn't we see Nate leaving West Ham? Could've maybe added to seeing Rupert's reaction to it, but nope we just get a whole episode of Nate sitting in bed doing nothing).!&lt;\n\nTed Lasso himself got 0 resolution. And also, in a show that revolved around football, there was a god damn lack of that in season 3.\n\nSeason 3 had it's moments, and it wasn't like a catastrophic failure, it was just so clear that the quality had dropped, and that the writers had no idea what to do with most of the characters.",

And I loved season 1.\n\n\u201cUnwatchable\u201d just means that something is frustrating or painful to watch to the point that you aren\u2019t deriving any pleasure out of the experience. Lots of things are unwatchable to me, and I\u2019m entitled to that opinion no matter what you think. It\u2019s not \u201chyperbolic\u201d at all.

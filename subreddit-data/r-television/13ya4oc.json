            "comment": "Damn, a lot of great shows premiered that year.\n\nThe X-Files was a major part of my TV viewing in the 90s.  Not right from the premiere (my first episode was \"Pusher,\" and that was most likely a repeat), but I really dug into it when I did.\n\nIt took me a while to get to Deep Space Nine after getting into Star Trek, but it became my favorite when I did.  Especially in the Dominion years.  Seasons 4-6 are my favorites of any Star Trek, with season 7 being a bit more inconsistent, but reaching the same heights.\n\nFrasier is right up there as one of my favorite spin-offs.  Loved the characters, and their dynamics with each other.  Personally, as much as I liked Cheers, I love Frasier even more.\n\nLois and Clark, while not my personal favorite Superman adaptation, was still an enjoyable take on the characters overall.  Unfortunately the latter half wasn't quite as good, with season 3 being my least favorite by a long shot (that damn arc where they do everything they can to keep the two apart was just awful).\n\nBeavis and Butt-Head's legacy speaks for itself.  It's stupid.  Incredibly so.  But it's funny, and has some pretty strong social commentary.  I've been liking the new series, as well as revisiting the older ones when they're added to Paramount+.\n\nI haven't seen Animaniacs since I was a kid, but remember really liking it.  I do want to come back to it again sometime to see if it holds up.",

I think it's *the* prime example of a spin-off eclipsing the original series in its legacy.",

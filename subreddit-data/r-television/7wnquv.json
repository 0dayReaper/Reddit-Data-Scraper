Katrina Witt returned after going professional after 1988, *and* she skated for a reunified Germany (she was originally East German). Oksana Baiul, Tonja Szewczenko, and Surja Bonaly really deserved more attention than they received. The big tragedy was Michelle Kwan actually stepped aside to give Nancy Kerrigan the other US spot. Because  the US officials allowed Harding to compete despite knowing that she was complicit in the attack. They later stripped her of her titles and banned her for life. I think their decision was for ratings because *everybody* watched that year. ",

Cause Kerrigan and Harding were old news by the time they olympics actually started. *Everything* was about Oksana Baiul. She was the darling of the olympics that year, with specials airing about her past and tragic upbringing and how she managed to make it to the olympics. A lot of girls took up skating because of how played up her story was during the '94 olympics. I honestly don't know how she could have received any more attention than she did.",

Every game in Korea requires you to put in what essentially is your social security number to sign up so that\u2019s how they filter out and block kids. Your social is tied to your phone number and name so it\u2019s a 3 factor authentication. Input social, input phone number, input name, get authentication code\n\nOne way kids get around this is use their mom or dads social to sign up for games since the parents don\u2019t really care for the most part. They just go \u201cdad I\u2019m signing up for some educational website and it\u2019s going to send you an authentication code your phone number... can you give it to me when it arrives?\u201d And the dad being at work and busy doesn\u2019t really care if the kid is lying or not and just sends the code once it arrives.",

Any kid from an average family growing up in the mountains can become a fantastic snowboarder or skier, but that's still miles away from traveling the globe to have constant access to snow in your 20s. Imagine how many teenagers were winning local snowboarding competitions but never went anywhere with it because of how massive that \"next step\" is.\n\nSpeaking anecdotally here, I fenced through middle school and part of high school. I did well in local competitions, and was lucky that the coach in my area was a former Olympian. Even that didn't matter, because I (and my family) hit that huge wall where I was essentially told \"from this point you either need to start traveling the country for better coaching/competition or get out of the sport.\" That just wasn't financially viable.",

It was only discovered through whistle blowers and then through investigations.\n\nThere's no doubt the performance enhancing drugs give boosts in capabilities. Bryan Fogel of Icarus (movie) fame proved it using a Russian doctor and documented the changes in his times.\n\nSo there are a few questions to be asked:\n\nIf Russians were the only ones on performance enhancing drugs, why weren't they they outside the normal performance levels of other athletes?\n\nMaybe Russians just naturally run/jump/throw slower than most other humans and the drugs just brought them up to competition values?\n\nMaybe most leading athletes are also taking PEDs?\n\n",

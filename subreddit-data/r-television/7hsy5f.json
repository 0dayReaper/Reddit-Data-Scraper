It happens to men but they are far less likely to come forward because the added stigmatism. \"You're a man. This doesn't happen to guys. If you can't stick up for yourself then you're a pussy.\"\n\nOn the same note in regards to women, \"you dressed slutty therefore you deserved it\" or \" why didn't you come forward sooner? You must be seeking attention.\"\n\nIt's victim shaming and blaming",

Anytime I would talk to my buddies about it to vent, they would tell me I was lucky and to stop bitching. I'm a monogamous guy that married at 19, so having a chick grab me wasn't a great experience for me. I saw it as humiliating and a violating, no different than if I had grabbed some chick. In several instances, the woman was my boss. Now I'm older and uglier, so advances don't happen as often, but I can see how a god like Terry Crews would get it 24/7. The dude probably couldn't even sleep in his own bed without some chick or dude trying to jump into bed with him. I feel for the dude, I really do.\n\nMaybe it's me being super drunk, but I think this sort of shit really needs to be destigmatized. Just because you have a dick doesn't mean you want to stick it into any hole you can. Same goes for pussies. Chicks have their preferences too. Why can't we all just agree to approach eachother in a way that is healthy and consensual?",

She tried to get released from the contract between herself and Luke/Sony. She was unable to do so, and as a result wasn't allowed to make any future music outside unless it was exclusively with Dr. Luke, effectively forcing her to work with the man she claimed to have sexually assaulted her if she wanted a career.  So she basically (and I'm starting to forget the facts at this point) went \"fuck this, I'll sink the boat to kill the captain\" and stopped making music, and that went on for years, along with lawsuits, etc. She is now thankfully free ~~of that contract~~\\*edit: ^(I fucked it, she's still under her original contract, but Dr. Luke's contract with Sony Music expired and isn't involved in the production of her music anymore, if I've fucked it up again, someone please let me know), and away from her assaulter, while Dr. Luke is still one of the most prominent names in the music industry. \\*edit2: ^(it appears Dr. Luke hasn't recorded a single Billboard top 10 hit since news of this broke in 2015, after having notched 40 top 10's in his career previously)",

It appears that her new album (which is great and very emotionally driven) was released under the Sony Music subsidiary Kemosabe records. Dr. Luke was the CEO of the label during this debacle, he was not retained by Sony when his contract expired in March 2017. So it sounds like he's still tied to the monetary profits, but only that, rather than the production side as well. Of course I could be totally fucking incorrect in my interpretation here because I just got off like 9 solid hours of work and have the exhaustion-induced donkey brain now.\n  \nAnother nice fact I learned: Dr. Luke hasn't recorded a Billboard Top 10 hit since this story began in 2015, so that's nice.",

The legal standard for that is not \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d; that standard applies only to criminal cases. The standard in a civil case like that one would be \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d (or some variant of that term), which basically just means that the evidence makes it more likely than not.

They could be locked up in legal battles for years.\n\nAlso you shouldn't listen to that Emma Stone thread. The mods stickied a post in there showing how she only is represented by the company that Venit works for (which is huge btw), not Venit himself.",

This is just a natural bi-product of humans.   Merit is almost never the deciding factor for a promotion in really any industry.  \n\nThere are two factors you should look at to estimate how plaugued an industry is with nepotism.    How in demand is the job?  (it pays well, the work is rewarding on its own, fame is attached, etc..)   How many qualified applicants for the job will you get? \n\n\nIf you have 5 people applying for a difficult job its likely that there will be a clear best candidate for the job and merit can be the main deciding factor.   But if you have 10,000 qualified people all applying for a super desirable job that is also easy, well there no possible way you could pick the most qualified candidate.  So you just pick your friends and family instead who are qualified enough. \n\nHollywood will always be a center for nepotism simply because of the incentives at play.  The uniqueness of Hollywood in this regard is that the number of qualified candidates pursuing the available jobs is insanely high. \nSo your agent is really just someone who understands which jobs you are qualified enough for and EXCELS at nepotism.    If you agent doesn't have connections it doesn't matter how smart or competent they are.  \n\nHell where I work you pretty much can't get a job unless you already know someone.  Everytime a new position opens up we will get hundres of qualified applicants and unless someone internally is pulling for you your chance of getting the job is slim to none, my job is pretty normal as well.   If nepotism is a clear at my job and a major factor in virtually every movement within the company, I can only imagine that Hollywood is ten thousands times worse. \n\n",

You don\u2019t notice it.  But they\u2019re fucking you. \n\nYou could see my paycheck and think I shouldn\u2019t complain because I was making a decent wage. On the other hand, when they decided to collude and form an illegal cartel for the sole purpose of suppressing artist wages and limiting mobility between studios (because that\u2019s often how you increased your pay - work here, then work there for more, then back at a higher rate still), then you realize the level of betrayal involved. \n\nTheir power and influence is way up there. You are a bug.  They are willing to break laws (antitrust regulations) to keep you from making more money.  Oh and they always made sure to call the artists in a studio \u201ca family\u201d.  Please. \n\nThe only reasons the animation lawsuit succeeded was that Ed Catmull was so arrogant he actually publicly bragged that he conspired with competing animation studios to create a gentleman\u2019s agreement to not hire from each other. \n\nI\u2019ve known talented artists wonder why the hell they weren\u2019t getting interviews at the studio across the street despite really strong credentiala.  \n\nFuck Pixar. They started this. ",

The reception of him going public by most of Hollywood has been utterly reprehensible.\n\nWhen Terry first came out with this, it helped me to open up about my own experience with this. The way people react to men being victims of abuse and/or assault is disgusting. That somehow it's less traumatic or serious because \"women don't have any power, socially, so they can't abuse men\" (actual quote from someone I talked to about the topic) is absurd, and I absolutely detest anyone that spews such drivel.

I was mortified and my friends laughed at me because I explained what happened and nobody saw it occur. In that moment it was as if all sense of security vanished and I felt so violated. As a 25 year old male I know this probably pales in comparison to what has happened to many females out there, but the point is that no matter who you are, or what gender you are, nobody should feel like they have the right to touch you inappropriately. I couldn\u2019t imagine having the person stare you in the eyes while doing this, I feel much sympathy for Terry.  ",

It's never okay for *anyone* to be assaulted and, unfortunately, there will always be someone who tries to invalidate your feelings about being assaulted, no matter what your gender. Hearing about assault makes people feel vulnerable and sometimes their reaction is to justify why it's not a big deal or why it's the victim's fault because then it's not something they have to worry about. It's a messed up response and it's definitely not okay, but it's hard to get people to stop doing it. Just try to remember it's their issue, and has nothing to do with you personally. ",

It made me wonder if he really felt that way or if he felt that way because he was conditioned by society to undermine male sexual assault. I have been groped and sexually assaulted multiple times as a woman (and I know I am not a special case; many women have experienced more/worse) and I felt exactly the same way as you did, losing sense of security, feeling helpless, feeling dirty and violated. I still have a hard time even calling it sexual assault though some might even call it a rape. I've been feeling for years that it's not because it's my fault and I didn't resist harder. All I can say is I would pay a lot of money to erase those memories from my head... and it was just shocking to hear being raped was just a funny story to someone.",

When I lost interest in soccer and started gaming a lot he went out and bought me a top of the line gaming PC.  I ended up playing games professionally and traveling the country and my Dad was there every step of the way.  He constantly doted on how I was a \"pro gamer\" before that was even a thing.  He lifted me up on his shoulder when I won the world tournament at 15.  He's such a good guy.  Just a super incredible human, always told me I could do anything and be anyone I wanted. Shaped me into the man I am today.  I look at any problem through the lens of, what would my father do?  And if I can't decide, I call him!\n\nEdit: Since people keep asking, the game I played was called Day of Defeat.  Usually I was popular enough that someone in a thread like this will recognise me.  So hey there gaming buddies!  Feel free to shoot me a PM, I mainly play League and Starcraft 2 now.  I got to be on Thorins show a few months ago if my decade old videogame antics interest you that much or you think I am for some strange reason lying about this.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sg6xVcFqIB4",

It is VERY difficult for people to break out from their social circles and make a scene.  \n\nYour boss comes into your office and grabs your genitals? You might think youd scream or storm out, but in the reality of the situation, most people are shocked and confused, and not wanting to potentially turn their life upside down. \n\nThe reason I mention this is because, while I know your heart is in the right place, you are telling OP that he didn't fight enough.  In my 30 years of dealing with this, I learned that one of the most true, and important things to tell complainants is that they did what they could at the time.\n\n",

All sexual predators need to be ashamed and afraid of Justice coming after them. No person should become a silent victim of sexual assault.

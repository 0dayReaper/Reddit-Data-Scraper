Tontry to finagle characters thst bybtheir nature don't really change, they've had to zero in on the few part of their stories where they do. That's how we've ended up with extended and repeated origin stories followed by awkward jumps to their burnout retirement years or their deaths.

                            "comment": "I've looked into this before, and it's got a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, redheads are massively overrepresented in fiction in general, but especially comics. This is because in the early days red was one of the basic ink colors, so redheads were easy to put on the page and had a level of visual distinctiveness that made them pop, especially when they were in the background. Someone like Superman is always going to be the focus of the action, but Jimmy Olsen is more likely to be in the crowd. With red hair, you can still ID him without an entire panel dedicated to his reaction. So, lots and lots of secondary characters got this treatment.\n\nNow, when doing modern adaptations, characters like that are the most likely to get superficial changes like a race-swap. A black Kal-El would make the usual suspects supremely angry, but a black Jimmy Olsen might just fly under their radar while allowing the Daily Planet to more accurately resemble an actual city. You'll also notice Perry White (heh) is another candidate. Important enough to feature in plenty of stories, but nobody's threatening to do a hate crime because he's played by Laurence Fishburne.\n\nSo, TL;DR, redheads show up in comics way more than they do in the general population, so they're statistically more likely to be race-swapped.",

These are the Mary Janes, Fionas, Starfires, Tris Merigolds, and Ariels.\n\nIn other cases, they are side characters to already existing characters or stories, who are often odd in appearance and add humor. These are the Ron Weasleys, Wally Wests, Bat Girls, and yes: Jimmy Olsen. \n\nI don\u2019t have a question of overrepresentation of redheads. I have a question of why black beauty is considered uncommon; why not just make a beautiful woman who is black? Why are there not more Storms, and Tatianas?\nI question why all the funny sidekicks are being switched to black. \n\nJimmy is a juxtaposition to Superman physically. Why change him to be black? Is it not an insult to make a black person the juxtaposition to Supes? Or is this just to fill a quota of characters to look like a study group on the leaflet of a local community college? \n\nThis is not to say you cannot change a fictional characters characteristics or race. Green Lantern is a really great example, but he was made into a new character altogether, with his own stories, problems, and character arc.\n\nThese are intentional choices done by executives to give the illusion of inclusion. My question is, does it feel that way?",

If it\u2019s like Unicorn Warriors Eternal (which has a TV-PG-V rating), they\u2019ll rerun the 5 new episodes on CN\u2019s Acme Night block on the last Sunday of the month. Unicorn airs new episodes on Thursdays at Midnight, reruns the new episode on Fridays at 7:00, and reruns them again on Toonami.

The only one I would argue who got an actual complete rewrite is the Joker, and that barely counts since his characterization in the comics is already so inconsistent. This is no further from the classic Joker than Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger were, just in a different direction.",

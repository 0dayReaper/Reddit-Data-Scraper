I wouldn't exactly call it post apocalypse. That combined with the lack of any mention of the tournament tells me this is another case of \"I couldn't sell my story so I took another property and made it my story\"\n\nAnd I agree. This should have been set up as an ensemble show where each character is fleshed out as we go.",

But, I eventually got bored and moved on. Still not a gamer, but I play sports games with my son when he asks. I\u2019m honestly not sure how they could add a plot to Twisted Metal, but seeing it made a movie brought back some fun memories.",

You can still train them, but it takes longer and some people just don't have the stamina to do it. It's one of the reasons I shy away from adopting the energetic breeds, it can be very hard to get them under control if they were raised poorly. I say this knowing I got yelled at last time I mentioned this on Reddit. I just don't recommend that type of dog unless the soon to be owner knows what they're getting into. ",

They tried chaining him up, fencing him, etc, but hes a free spirit and needs to be let loose. We often wonder what whacky adventures Diego gets into.\n\nedit: Sweet Christmas, like 20 people have told me to put a gopro on the dog. Its not my dog, but the owners arent really well off enough to afford something like that. Would be pretty awesome though.\n\nedit 2: I texted him and told him about the interest and to set up a gofundme if he was interested in getting a free gopro. I told him im not setting it up for him, because im not incurring the wrath of the internet if he gets it and doesn't deliver \"the adventures of Diego\"\n\nedit 3: he said he will look into setting up a gofundme after he gets off work tonight. If you are interested in funding a gopro for this save this post and check back tomorrow, if he makes one i will update with the link\n\nedit 4: **An awesome redditor /u/NerdyBrando has offered to donate a gopro and I have sent him my friends mailing information!** Once he receives the gopro and gets the footage what would be the best sub to post it in as well as what would be the best way to disseminate that post to everyone here whos shown interest? This will probably be at the very least a few weeks to a month or so from now, so maybe adjust your remindmes out a month from now or so, ill  update this post when we have some actual footage of \"**The adventures of Diego**\"\n\nEdit 5: **Pictures of Diego**!!!!!!! http://imgur.com/a/eqAZ8\n\nAlso posted in /r/aww https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/6txjl7/diego_the_texan_husky/",

Weekend's we go to the dog park or hike up mountains. I have a 1 bedroom apartment also. That being said though.. He's the most chill husky you would probably ever meet. VERY SILENT, you wouldn't even know there is a dog in the house. He doesn't bark or talk (unless you play/fuck with him) the most you'll hear from him is when he gets up to stretch and he makes his little grunting sounds like an old man. You are right though, they need alot and attention. LONG walks aren't everything in my experience though. Just need to compensate and put that energy into something that'll get him exhausted.",

There are definitely sled dogs who are lazy as they come. It's just less likely to happen with them than it is for a less active breed.\n\n**Unnecessary rant alert:** one of my pet peeves is the unrealistic level of advice generally given to dog owners online. If you believed all of it at face value, you'd think that every dog shouldn't be left alone for more than 3 hours, needs to be exercised for 2 hours daily, and needs at least 1 acre of space to roam. You know what most dogs do while nobody is home? Sleep and eat. Install some smart cameras in your home and watch them if you don't believe me.\n\nMake no mistake: owning a dog is a responsibility that many people do underestimate. That includes appropriate amounts of food, exercise, and socialization. You are a bad owner if you're neglecting your dog's needs. Most dogs that are surrendered to shelters are surrendered because the owner underestimated the responsibility or is unable to maintain it. But you don't have to be some sort of unemployed person with a hobby farm who hikes daily to be a good dog owner either. There's nothing wrong with being just an average dog owner either. Plenty of people work 9-5 and have happy dogs. Plenty of people have happy dogs who get maybe a half hour of exercise a day. Plenty of apartment owners have happy big dogs. ",

They also have a tendency towards destructiveness when bored and neurotic tendencies in general, and malamutes can have an agressive streak if not properly socialized.\n\n They're not a good choice for folks who don't have the time or space to exercise them (they need to *run* for hours every day), the patience/skill to train them (they're very smart and independent), the money and/or time to groom them, or live in hot climates.\n\n\n And breeding needs to be done very carefully to avoid hip dysplasia, which has run rampant in the breed.

This is her exercise requirement at almost 10 years old.   For most of the previous 9 years, that number was more like 4.\n\nHer coat sheds constantly, and her undercoat completely blows out two times a year.   When this happens, she has fur come out in clumps and has to be brushed constantly.   When her undercoat breaks loose, it's enough fur to make a couple of extra dogs probably.\n\nThen there's the issue of aggression.  Huskies are great with people, but they *may* not be so great with other dogs, or small animals  (there are caveats to this...Samoyeds aren't mean at all, some Siberians aren't like this, etc.).  So if you have a cat and leave it alone with your husky, you may come home to a dismembered kitty.   I kind of hate all the pictures on reddit of huskies with cats for that reason...you can teach a husky to get along with a cat but it's not typically easy, if it's even possible.\n\nThen you have the fact that they are escape artists.   That's a topic we could spend hours covering all on its own.   Also related, they are strong as hell.  This is a dog breed that will win at a game of tug of war typically.  \n\nThat being said, I love huskies and have had several.  But you have to know what you're getting into.   They are not a beginner's model, that's for sure.\n\n\n",

Everyone talked about how much work they are, how much exercise they require, and how they will literally destroy a couch if they aren't taken care of.\n\nI thought everybody else was just lazy or poor trainers. \n\nMy god was I in for an awakening. By the time she was 1 I had hit my senior year of college and at a *bare minimum* she needed a 2 mile run or 5 mile walk a day in order for her to not go batshit insane in my house. If she wasnt properly exercised she would whine, howl, pace, and scratch at my leg until I took her outside.\n\nThen you have to deal with the pulling. Typically you train this habit out of dogs-- but it's literally in the huskies DNA to tug and pull. Combined with their psycho ~~pray~~ prey drive, I've almost dislocated a shoulder when she lunged at a squirrel out of nowhere. \n\nIf the husky isnt attached to your body outside, say goodbye. If your neighbor kid accidentally lets your husky out the front door you can't just call their name and expect them to come running back. The husky will stop briefly, look back at you, then take off running even faster in the opposite direction. They don't give a fuck about you when they have escaped. Maybe it'll come back in about 6 hours after it's torn up every single garden in the neighborhood, killed a neighbors cat, and took a swim in a swamp 2 cities down. \n\nI've seen such an increase in husky puppies on my old college campus and on friends' snapchats. Then a couple of months later they end up quietly disappearing. It's terrible. \n\nThey have the absolute best and most hilarious personality of any puppers I've ever met, but *god damn* are they a lot of work. ",

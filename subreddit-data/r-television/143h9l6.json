But generally, Iron Man 3 is about Iron Man. Mando 3 dropped everything it had going for Mando - having to choose between radical greed and burgeoning faith in an individual, and the desire to be a father figure rather than a cult leader - all that was brushed aside, and for what? Even the dark saber duel set up was tossed aside with nothing. \n\nThe journey is supposed to be the point, not the destination, and this season was a long drive through Saskatchewan.",

This is why I have no expectations Loki: Season 2 will follow this pattern because Marvel's gonna Marvel and they show no interest in doing that again.",

Like there's other threads in this post talking about how \"great\" grand inquisitor was in Rebels. Rebels I think gets pretty entertaining, but the inquisitor in season 1 is just a saturday morning cartoon villian with little to say or do other than looking scary to kids. All of Star Wars is fun and can be pretty good, but none of it is high prestige film.",

Filoni, BDH, heck even Deborah Chow to an extent because a $120 million Obiwan show obviously proved too much for her to handle. Star Wars should be receiving the gold standard in creative talent. \n\nDoes it shock anyone that the best Star Wars content in a while (Andor) also had the most competent people behind the scenes?",

TCW works because its very much take it or leave it, for every great episode you get a silly R2D2 one. Its has filler!",

It\u2019s when they want their ideas on screen as opposed to what makes sense for the series. \n\nWhat I mean by that is, there\u2019s thousands of people on this sub that would jump at a Yoda, Luke, or Vader focused series or movie, but those are so unnecessary. \n\nThen you have the group who\u2019d just add weird shit to the series to add weird shit. Thinking of new force powers just because. \n\nThen you will have people who actually respect the material and not deter from it. It\u2019s a fine line, but they\u2019re choosing people who are more those first two groups as opposed to the third listed. \n\nI think fans have good ideas that can absolutely contribute, but it\u2019s the vetting process. At any one time Lucasfilm should be having NUMEROUS script writers working on projects because somebody can make some story that is new, fresh, and feels like Star Wars without having to tie it to pre existing characters or events. \n\nTLDR: there\u2019s potential for fans to write and helm great stories but Lucasfilm hires the hot hand in Hollywood and push stories of what Star Wars meant to them in \u201877 etc etc etc but then regurgitate crap on screen.",

What I'm referring to is the average maturity/developmental level of the intended audience.  Andor, for example, is squarely aimed at sophisticated adult audiences, without much interest in looping in younger viewers.  The Mandalorian is aimed a bit lower, at a more \"whole family\" audience.  The cartoons are aimed even lower than that, squarely at the kids.  Certainly it isn't Blues Clues-level, but the emotional maturity and sophistication of the writing is more in-line with what you'd find in a cartoon that's aimed at older kids with the goal of looping in some particularly dedicated adults (fans) as well.\n\nThat doesn't make it *bad*, per se, and certainly it's not something I'm complaining about, since this is a family franchise after all.  It just makes it something that my wife and I probably won't be able to really enjoy.  Even this last season of Mandalorian had me rolling my eyes a bit too much at the silliness and lack of depth.  What we're planning to do is try to pick and choose a few key episodes of Clone Wars/Rebels that will hopefully enhance our Ahsoka experience, so we'll see how that goes.",

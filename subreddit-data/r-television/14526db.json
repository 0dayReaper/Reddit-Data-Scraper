    "postText": "Hugely enjoyed The Katering Show, which is very funny, so I tried this out on the basis of the creators' involvement, half expecting something along the lines of Touch of Cloth given the marketing. \n\nIt turns out to be probably more in the wheelhouse of Fargo though, and I've been pleasantly surprised by how compelling the actual central murder mystery is in practice. The clues and misdirects are really well laid down - 4 eps in, there are still a bunch of suspects I could talk myself into betting on, and the Scandi noir influence is clear without being full on pastiche.\n\nThe characters - well, one particular character - are a little broad in the first eps, but they settle down quickly, and the humor pulls back at the right time to pay out the murder plotline. There is some commentary on murder media and coverage, but it\u2019s integrated deftly enough into the rest not to distract, and I really liked that one particular clich\u00e9 I expected - the dickhead savant detective - was dodged pretty solidly. Dulcie, the lead, is low key and likeable without being dull, and the blur between her personal life and the case feels very plausible for the kind of small town it is (and the stuff about her wife that initially felt like throwaway comic relief might not be after all)\n\nThis week's installment was my favorite yet, and if I have any gripes it's that I'm already sorry the show is about half over when Ep 1 and 2 spent so much time introing everyone. I know that's how these shows tend to be structured, but I'm really enjoying how the team feel now they're working together and I can't see how they could make an S2 work. \n\nI'd strongly recommend folks jump in while it's still running rather than binging it all at once, because it is the kind of show that benefits from leaving you hanging for a few days. \n\nAnyhow, give it a shot. I've heard a bunch of people say they had problems searching it on Amazon because it kept offering them Dead*lock*, but it is worth digging around for, and if the big strokes of ep 1 put you off, it's worth hanging in there.",

She was all over the place, histrionic, and constantly letting us know that, yes, she doesn't want to be there. Then I realized that she is a serious mess and doesn't even know how to get out of it. \nThen there's detective Dulcie that is slowly realizing that her quiet, honest, small town is not so quiet and honest, that there are a few people living a double life (Margaret and Aleyna, I'm looking at you two) and that she has as much authority there as a meter maid.",

She only becomes an effective cop *after* she starts pulling herself together. And I really enjoy her trying to be \"nice\" in a way I sure didn't before.\n\nDulcie meanwhile... not sure if you've seen this week's episode, but the dinner party... dang, Dulcie. Cath may be a little cringey and birkenstocky, but it turns out she's not nearly as irrational as she seemed before, and Dulcie isn't quite as straightforward as presented either.",

Let's see what happened. \nThe thing I liked the most so far (3 episodes) is that both Dulcie and Eddie have been right so far in their clashing theories. Maybe not identifying the killer right away, but they both have followed hunches that have paid off one way or another. So it is funny because they are both right.",

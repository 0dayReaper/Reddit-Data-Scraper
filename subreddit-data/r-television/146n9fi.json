Has any other show that was on for a long time had a finale that showed that kind of homage by basically thanking the entire roster of past guests (it seems like every one who ever had a speaking role was invited). \n\nI find it quite incredible what they pulled off. I know it\u2019s not a beloved show, but as for great finales, it deserves to be in the discussion!",

More like a natural conclusion to most characters' arcs, many of whom had appeared earlier in the season.\n\nTo be closer to what OP described, it would need surprise cameos from characters like Royce, Ziggy, Burrell, Poot, etc.",

Poot also shows up earlier in the season for a cameo.",

They all appear in the final season, but not the finale.\n\nSome others, like the Greeks, also popped up earlier in the season, so their final appearance isn't especially 'cameo-ey\".\n\nWhich speaks to the ensemble nature of *The Wire*, as opposed to *Blindspot*. Hard to do final episode cameos when the show already went to great lengths to follow up on all those people in a more natural way.",

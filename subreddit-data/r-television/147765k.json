    "postText": "I understand it was for the sake of drama and because everyone lost Derek and they were all close to him, but it\u2019s crazy that all the doctors (at least at the dinner party) seemed to be at the least unsympathetic for Penny, as if they all hadn\u2019t had patients who died on them.\n\nHell, there have been instances where people died in this show and the doctors are like \u201c\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f we\u2019ll get the next one.\u201d I know they needed someone to blame, but tbh watching how everyone shits on Penny is a little infuriating.\n\nPenny should\u2019ve cut her losses and skipped out on that job Fr.",

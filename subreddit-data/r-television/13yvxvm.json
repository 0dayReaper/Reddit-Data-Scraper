    "postText": "I'm so mad about this, the basic plan would have been perfect for me since I'm the only one who would be using my account and 720p is more than good enough. Heck to the no for the advert plan, and you can't even download to watch offline. But the next step up is over $16 here in Canada.\nWhy would they get rid of the best plan for single people who don't have anyone they are sharing with? Is Netflix literally trying to encourage people to not sign up? I was literally gonna join now and sign up with the basic plan (as my buddy did literally a couple weeks ago).",

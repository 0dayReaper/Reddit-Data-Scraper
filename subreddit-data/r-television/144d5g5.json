So here's to hope, though in this crazy television landscape where they shelve unaired shows and cut costs, who knows what they will do.\n\nOnly sad thing is with the writer's strike on-going, it will probably take another two years to the next season if they get renewed for another season.",

It's such a good little detail that they keep hammering on, his big fight in the first episode is 100% homage to Bruce.  They also paid tribute to several of his films, the Enter the Dragon homage was fucking insane.",

And when I watched banshee I was still in my edgelord phase so I liked the protagonist more. However, I believe it was the fight in the third episode that hooked me, but I do remember the fights in the show basically disappeared after the third season as they were taking a toll on Anthony starrs body.  \n\nMaybe after reading this thread I should give warrior another chance I just remember feeling underwhelmed watching it but I also watched it right around when I watched season one of gangs of London which might have effected my perspective.",

Crackers is half hour and definitely a part of adult swims push to find another half hour hit. maybe not on the scale of Rick and Morty but maybe something like robot chicken. most of adult swims new shows since the start of 2021 have been half hour. birdgirl, teenage euthanasia, tuca and bertie, royal crackers, plus various written off anime originals. yet ironically their biggest new hit is the only new quarter hour show they've made in that timeframe, smiling friends.\n\nYOLO is quarter hour too but that came from 2020, probably one of the network's better years for content in general, it was packed. depressing ending to the year though with Venture getting cancelled and the online streams getting gutted.\n\nUnicorn is doing real well, but it also should be noted that the show was picked up for cartoon network in mind. we didn't know it was moving to adult swim until a month before the premiere.",

Always sad the revival rumors never led to anything, the show had a fuckin amazing run tho. Just a special show and RIP to the cast members who have passed away since then.",

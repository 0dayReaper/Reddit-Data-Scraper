Had some inspiration from a contemporary group (I can't remember who exactly at the moment) that ended a lot of skits by breaking the fourth wall and having the actors basically announce that the sketch was over\n\nYou can see a lot of the effort to wrap up a sketch without coming down to a bookended punchline--like the \"this has gotten much too silly!\" scenes, or the knight clubbing people over the head with a rubber chicken. And of course the Gilliam animations!",

He\u2019d done all these sketches that didn\u2019t have beginnings or ends. They\u2019d just stop or they\u2019d turn into a different sketch or something and he just didn\u2019t care. I was thinking, \u201cHow can we do that, how can we use that breakthrough that Milligan\u2019s got there?\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning the precursor work of the Pythons : \u201cDo Not Adjust Your Set\u201d (Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, David Jason, Denise Coffey) and \u201cAt Last The 1948 Show\u201d (John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Marty Feldman, Aimi MacDonald, David Frost). \n\nThese shows were aired at \u201cTea-Time\u201d and were very popular. \n\nAnd, of course, there was also the ultimate inspiration for the Pythons : \u201cThe Goon Show\u201d, which was hugely popular, well loved, and respected. \n\nOf course, many of those influences and precursors are now generally little known (with the exception of \u201cThe Goon Show\u201d) and it\u2019s perhaps easy to mistakenly view the Python\u2019s as solitary comedic islands, whereas they were in fact very much ingrained into a particular lineage of popular entertainment at the time.

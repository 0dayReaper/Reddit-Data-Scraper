I actually think he did such good job, that I started hating Joffrey a little less, because he was just that entertaining to watch.\n\nI just disagree with this increasingly commont sentiment, that if you hate a villainous character, then that automatically means the actor did a great job. I'd argue that it's the opposite. Unless it starts bordering on comically bad, a worse actor would probably make you hate the character even more, since now you're gonna hate the character *and* the performance.",

He was very well acted and written.  In addition to being a sadistic psycho, he was just an annoying little shit.  Jack Gleeson was great at making these little expressions and doing little things that made him come across as an unlikeable little brat. \n\nI don\u2019t blame the actor for Euron sucking.  He was just awfully written.  He was a plot device to weaken Daenerys.",

Could be because of good writing and being a good character foil to a hero or tons of other reason.

In the books he still did evil things but my reaction was more in line with how you'd react to some of the fucked up things medieval English kings did, yes it's bad but experiencing it first hand (or a realistic enough interpretation of first hand) makes it far worse than just reading about it, a lesser actor wouldn't have been able to make me think that, I'd just be thinking about how bad it is in the context of the story rather than feeling as if it was happening in real life.",

The first one is a statement about media preferences. Some people like to watch or find it easier to connect with shows that have good characters or an optimistic setting/premise. That's a different but equally valid premise to preferring grimdark or 'morally grey'. It doesn't affect anyone else, it's just a preference.\n\nThe second one shows a fundamental misunderstanding of acting and leads to people taking out their frustrations on parasocial relationships in harmful and potentially dangerous ways.",

To assume that every main character has to be a relatable hero in the story is a fundamental misunderstanding of storytelling. Sure, it's a preference, but it's a shit preference that only makes sense if it's being voiced by a child.",

You enjoy Succession and other shows like it, good for you, not everyone else has to.\n\n&gt;It's rooted in an inability to separate the character from the context of the grander story.\n\nNo, I disagree completely - liking a show is not about appreciating the grander story. That is one aspects among many that you may or may not like. You can like it dislike a show for the narrative, a character, the setting, the aesthetic, and a hundred other reasons. Preferences don't have rules.\n\nI think you're conflating someone saying they like a piece of media with someone saying they think it's well made. \"I don't like any of the characters in Succession and therefore it's a badly made show\" is not the same as \"I don't like any of the characters in Succession and therefore I don't like the show.\"\n\nYou can dislike something while acknowledging that it is well made, and vice-versa. Breaking Bad is an objectively well made show that I had no interest in watching because I didn't like Walt so I didn't care to watch what happened to him. Downton Abbey is a great show that I didn't want to watch because the setting wasn't exciting to me, and the pacing was a bit slow.",

It's more than just a preference. It's a stupid American misconception that every main character has to be the hero with flaws that are revered and idolized. It's especially prevalent in comedy. \n\nStephen Fry describes it quite well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k2AbqTBxao\n\nYou can call it a preference, as if any preference has to be defended, but I disagree. You can prefer not to have a Mexican neighbor and obviously that is rooted in ignorance and indefensible. You can prefer a story from the POV of a flawless hero, that is boring as shit and I'm going to judge you.",

They\u2019re all pretty gray. \n       \nPeople root for Rhaenyra, and she would likely make a better \u201cQueen\u201d than Allicent\u2026 but Rhaenyra made terrible, selfish decisions to pass off three bastards as the future heirs to the throne. As shitty as Allicent\u2019s children are, they are true-born Targaryens, and their claim to the throne is not under question. \n      \nI\u2019m not sure that the audience is really supposed to pick a side. All of these characters share great leadership qualities alongside debilitating flaws. King Viserys could be argued to be a great King because his long reign was marked by decades of peace\u2026 but his weak actions also set everything in motion that will lead to civil war, intra-family killings, and the downfall of the Targaryen dynasty. It seems silly to pick one side or the other in a GRRM story. Even the winners will be losers by the end of this series.",

But in the world of Game of Thrones, she\u2019s a grey character who\u2019s just as selfish &amp; a manipulator/liar. she is developing as a character but shes a gray character just like Allicent. \n\nBut if we take our modern perspective out of the equation and look at it from as a villager or a perspective as commoner from game of thrones, Rhaenyra lies and manipulative really doesn\u2019t fit what the characters and common folk would want or cheer for because she goes against tradition and doesn\u2019t have integrity. Nor does she keep her husband in check. So looking from that perspective she\u2019s not really the hero. She\u2019s just another gray selfish character who\u2019s just pulls strings a little better then allicent.",

Leaving the succession til after his death was a huge mistake, and I can\u2019t blame Allicent for hearing what she wanted to hear in his fevered last words.

I think it's pretty clear that I think Rhaenyra makes bad choices, it's just that they're more a product of her inability to grasp her situation, whereas Alicent's choices are about specifically trying to manipulate her way above Rhaenyra. Alicent's struggle is with politics, Rhaenyra's struggle is with herself. I ultimately sympathize with someone trying to keep her unconventional family together after a string of selfish choices rather than sympathize with someone who is trying to intentionally ruin someone else in order to get what they have.\n\nNeither group is really meant to be seen as perfect, totally selfish or selfless actors, but at the heart of the Green's platform is a set of values I have the luxury of knowing is not ultimately actually beneficial to society and the desire to take what is Rhaenyra's by decree.\n\nNot to mention at this point in the story Alicent's family has been *incredibly* underhanded between the murders and coverups. It makes it very hard to sympathize when the worst Rhaenyra does for a while is have an open marriage.",

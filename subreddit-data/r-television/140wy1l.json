There are too much TV to watch these days to waste my time on garbage. \n\nAlthough I admit I finished \u2018Rabbit Hole\u2019 without enjoying a single episode. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I tried watching The Mist a long while ago and it only took half an episode for me to tap out.",

I don't think everything he wrote is a sign of perversion or something, this is just an errant thought I had about Dollhouse, a show that felt vaguely uncomfortable to me long before anything had come out about him.

I start and stopped they series so many times, but once I got over the hump, I really enjoyed it. Community also took me about 5 episodes. The ironic part is now when I rewatch it those first few episodes are among my favorite.\n\nRabbit Hole I kept trying since it's weekly and I kept thinking give it another episode and maybe it'll click but after about episode 4, it's a no.

But I was a big Star Wars fan, so willing to give it that chance. And I usually was able to skip an episode if I noticed the first few minutes indicated a cringe episode, since it\u2019s pretty much an anthology at the start.\n\nFor serialized dramas, I\u2019ll give it around 4-5 episodes to get good, but only if the first episode gives me something that\u2019s interesting or intriguing, even if it doesn\u2019t hit greatness yet. For example, Breaking Bad didn\u2019t hook me until the Crazy 8 plate in the basement, but I was definitely interested by the end of the first episode.",

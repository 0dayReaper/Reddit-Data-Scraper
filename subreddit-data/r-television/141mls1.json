    "postText": "We have quite a double standard seeing how some people react to The Idol. Let's remember that the same people raved about the first season of Euphoria because it was so edgy. The first season of Euphoria objectified male bodies and showed explicit male nudity. Back then, reviewers and social media were thrilled to see it. The second season of Euphoria, while continuing to do the same with male characters and male bodies, began to objectify female characters as well. The second season has already been hated by various groups of critics and social media people. The Idol tweaked the theme of Season 2's Euphoria even more, objectifying the female characters even more. It was too much for critics and social media influencers. This is ridiculous. The Idol is a more interesting series than Euphoria because, contrary to what critics say, it is not as vulgar as Euphoria. In The Idol, the main emphasis is on telling the story as well as poking fun at certain ideologies that plague Hollywood, not on cheap shock.",

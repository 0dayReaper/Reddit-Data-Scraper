Everyone (boomer family, not peers in their 30s) joke about us spending \"too much\" time, and make \"uh-oh\" jokes. But, it's been great for us, our communication has never been better.\n\nEdit to add: I'm SO HAPPY to hear so many have had a similar experience. I feel fortunate to be with someone who is so loving and caring, someone that I mesh with so well. We have a daughter who just turned 2, and while she's still in daycare, we get her all to ourselves in the evenings and weekends (not letting family visit because most are not being safe). We've really gotten to bond with her as well as make a lot of lasting memories.",

I am beginning to just accept that life will never be like it once was before I did drugs, and that my brain is just messed up. I cant really experience pleasure in day to day life at all anymore. Because doing oxy at age 16 to 21 really messed up my pleasure center, constantly being in euphoria like that will change your brain. And now, nothing is enjoyable to me anymore  I'm 25 now and I'm over a year sober. But I went to methadone maintenance because I couldn't take it anymore. I mean really what is the point of living if you literally only experience pain and have nothing to be happy about? Im really lucky I didnt kill myself.\n\nIf that doesnt tell you how hard opiate addiction is, then you will never understand unless you have been through that hell. I wouldn't wish it on anyone not even Hitler. It's just so crazy to me how 1 substance can change your reality so strongly that it impacts you forever.",

Mulaney is a guest on Late Night and talks to his old friend Seth before/after taping about how fun SNL was and how much he misses working in comedy.\n\n4. Seth says \"you're always welcome to write for my show. It doesn't have to be full time, just come do a segment or two whenever you want.\"\n\nThis is all speculation.",

He made it clear that he never stops being one. You are never cured. He just makes a decision every day to not be the man who does those things.\n\nMy therapist stated a similar thing with depression and happiness. He said one of the important education milestones of depression is to realize that you are never cured. There is never a spontaneous release or magic wave that makes it go away. Dedication to bettering yourself and not allowing the disease (is it clinically recognized as a disease?) to overtake you and set you on a path where depression is the norm and not a period. He kind of suggested that it's like constantly crawling out of a vat of glue. No one is at fault for you being in the vat. However, if you wish to get out, only you can get yourself out.",

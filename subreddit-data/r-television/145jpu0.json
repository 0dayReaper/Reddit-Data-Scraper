Fifteen years from now, a woman being vetted for a Supreme Court seat recounts her experience at a prominent D.C. law firm in 2023, where the only thing more controversial than the cases was her messy love life, caught between two feuding brothers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, with a Supreme Court seat on the line, all of her darkest secrets are at risk of coming out, threatening her nomination, her reputation, and her marriage.\u201d\n\n**\"The Hurt Unit\"**\n\n&gt; Per the official logline, the show is \u201ca cutting-edge medical drama about a highly skilled team of trauma surgeons and nurses who race into the field to treat the patients who won\u2019t make it to the hospital in time. When the sick and the injured can\u2019t get to the ER, the Hurt Unit (Hospital Urgent Response Team) brings the ER to them.\u201d \n\n**\"Keeping It Together\"**\n\n&gt; Per the official logline, \u201cWith the help of new friends Calvin and Liz, Julia discovers she just might succeed at balancing work and parenting from time to time. This is a comedy for anybody who\u2019s dropped their kids at school, breathed a sigh of relief\u2026then realized it\u2019s Sunday.\u201d",

I feel like the networks been on a huge downward spiral since COVID, aside from Abbott Elementary there\u2019s really nothing much on there I want to watch. Just a sad state of affairs over there, I remember maybe 4 or 5 years ago when there were 10 great sitcoms on the fall schedule now we\u2019re lucky to have 1 great one and 3 mediocre ones",

I\u2019m curious to see what will become of what was semi-recently a great hub for sitcoms. I had read somewhere a while ago  that the second season of the Wonder Years reboot was being held for the fall but then I saw it is premiering on Wednesday so I guess that\u2019s not happening. Sucks because I thought it was pretty solid and better than most reboots I\u2019ve been seeing. Oh well!",

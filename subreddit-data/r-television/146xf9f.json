It's a shame it didn't get wider attention or mainstream attention is should say as it's a great TV show and Billie Piper plays the part really well. She's a talented actress. I hope this comparison doesn't detract from a worthy TV programme.",

She was the victim, but still, it sorta cut her career short (at least from what I remember of it). But somehow she crawled back from that and got the Doctor Who gig which let her back into the limelight. And then her stint in Penny Dreadful was fucking amazing (imo), cementing her acting chops.  \nHaven't heard a bad thing about her acting so far, so fair play to her and may she keep going!  \n\nThe fact that the article doesn't even fucking parallel Billie's own career with that of her character is kinda hilarious, i gotta say.",

If a show or movie was older or appeared in movie theaters or was on one of their TV networks, he booked it as having no cost to Disney+.  Which isn't true, it's cost is the lost revenue of selling it to some other streaming service.\n\nThey're starting to realize that a lot of properties that are on Disney+ would make more money being licensed to someone else.  Now that the true cost of programming for Disney+ is public information, the execs at Disney are trying to slash content and raise prices to try and get back to break even on this venture.",

Now it seems that short-term profitability rather than long-term market share is the order of the day, which is probably good news for Netflix as it makes Disney+ much easier to compete against.",

CFO did a power play claiming he was hiding the numbers ro get Iger back to save her friends. She is now pushing for CEO position once iger steps down. Problem is what they accused chapek doing iger and the CFO were caught fudging the numbers as well. The fall out of film flops are still Igers fault. Iger was pro at buying assets and cannibalizing them. Also why under Iger they made so many more sequels and did very little original new IP. Chapek never got the chance to redirect disney as iger projects were still being process via contracts.",

They'll make it generic like the other Marvel shows, when it stood out as being the best since Netflix had more freedom. Now with the writer's strike that is ongoing, filming isn't even complete yet, so it's going to cause so much setbacks. At this point, wouldn't be surprised if Disney pulls it and writes it off as well. I hope not, and it looks solid now, but who knows.",

They also, unfortunately, have very little competition. Most of the other platforms have maybe like one or two solid kids titles: Max has Sesame Street, Apple TV+ has Fraggle Rock. Disney has a deep well of the best kids content, and very little competition. \n\nThe path forward for Disney+ in this penny-pinching corporate streaming hell is 100% kids content. They will jettison Marvel &amp; Star Wars properties, because they can make more on licensing to other platforms. Also, it\u2019s undoubtedly painful to spend top dollar to make a critically panned show that tanks with viewers when your only path to recoup costs is raw viewership and subscriptions. If Disney made Mando or Book of Boba for a different platform, massive upfront licensing agreements would cover the lion share of the costs. By comparison, my kids aren\u2019t going to trash Bluey all over Internet forums like it\u2019s their full time job if the creators produce a weak season. Bluey will be played on heavy rotation no matter what.",

Plus, I frankly enjoy seeing more focus on average people and their struggle to survive.\n\nLike, there's so much galaxy out there. Let's explore more of that please.",

Season 3 was clearly a big deal to Disney and ended up the worst one yet.\n\nIt hurts, because Rogue One and Andor were great, but I'm honestly expecting Season 2 to be a mess that tries to plug Andor into too many other productions and has other important characters not previously connected to the story forcibly and awkwardly jammed into the show to make it \"better\".",

Like it was just flat out more convenient and sort of had everything on it. So a lot of people stopped pirating, it's like if I can pay 10/20 dollars a month and it seamlessly works on my phone my laptop my TV great I'll pay.  \n\nNow the content is so spread out over so many services, not only is it extremely expensive but it's also really inconvenient to have so many different apps of varying quality on all your devices.\n\nAnd now they are pulling down their own content so literally the only place to get that content is piracy.  It's becoming the better more convienient option again regardless of price.",

So, I'm looking at a free to me service going paid likely, and everyone is raising their subscription fees. I'm now to the point where I could afford all the services I needed without thinking too much about it, but I'm going to start rotating my subscriptions and I don't think I'm alone. These services may we'll see their revenues falling in the next year.",

I can definitely understand why other people would think twice about continuing, though. Especially if they start losing their favorite titles and the price becomes not worth it.\n\nI'm still an avid collector of physical copies of our favorite films and shows. I watch streaming out of convenience, but if a service starts losing the vast majority of the reason I use it, it becomes no longer convenient, and I cut ties. We'll end up doing the same with Disney+ if our living room shelf starts providing more than the streaming service does.",

It looks like there's 3 Marvel series that should be out this year and 2 more Star Wars series, so basically 1 Marvel/Star Wars series every other month on average. Aside from Marvel/Star Wars series, some children's shows, and a handful of family movies that look roughly Hallmark channel quality, Disney+ has managed to produce...  Um... Willow, which they're going to nuke from orbit, and... well, I guess we can count Turning Red and Soul, even though they were supposed to be theater movies that got bumped due to the pandemic. And... Uh...\n\nSeriously, what in the hell is going on at Disney that they're managing to lose over $1.5 billion a year while producing so little content?",

I was actually overwhelmed thinking I wouldn't be able to watch everything I wanted while they were available, and that's despite having a smaller library than Netflix. I'm not that concerned about quantity if the selections are good.\n\nNow it's like 1 or 2 new good movies per month and shit tons reality shows that I'll never watch.  There's a few HBO originals I'm mildly curious about, but I've already watched the ones I was really interested in \n\nEven Pluto is destroying them on new movie content. That's embarrassing. They added a lot of good stuff this month. Too bad their player is broken though",

So if you paid $1 million to license a show and expect it to be on the platform for 4 years, you would show $250k of expenses in your financials every year. To get more technical, at the start you would have an asset worth $1 million that you would depreciate by $250k each year as you recognize the expenses.\n\nIf you decide to take the content off the platform after 2 years, though, you've only recognized $500k of the expense associated with the show. You still have another $500k asset on your balance sheet that is functionally worthless, so you need to write off the asset and recognize all of the expenses now.\n\nFrom a tax perspective, you will have higher expenses this year which will reduce your taxable income, and therefore lower your tax bill.",

I thought that these original shows were basically meant to stay on the platforms permanently but evidently not considering both Disney and HBO are pulling them off and they're basically asking for people to pirate and archive their content because they clearly can't be trusted. \n\nWe've come full circle. Cable companies got greedy, so people began streaming. Now streaming companies are getting greedy and we'll probably begin to once again see a rise in physical media and piracy. At least I don't have to worry about the Disney gestapo coming in and stealing my Blu-rays and DVDs, but who knows it's Disney and they'll find a way.",

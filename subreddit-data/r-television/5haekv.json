It lulls you into feeling safe, and puts you immediately in a position to receive what he is saying. Child or adult, he was a master of captivating his audience.  His good message was heard by us as kids, and in this example, heard clearly by this panel.  I could not click off of it. Still amazed by him after all these years.  We miss you badly Fred.",

            "comment": "My sophomore year of high school, I had a teacher named Mr. Brown. He taught English and Reading (basically a Lit Appreciation class.) Every Friday, he would start class by going to the coat closet, putting on a sweater, and changing his shoes. Then he would sit on the table at the front of the class and sing the opening theme to Mr.Rogers Neighborhood and read us a story. \n\nNow being teenagers, this was ridiculously stupid and embarrassing. Until the third or fourth week. Then someone would sing a few words here or there. By two months in, we would all sing along. There's something about the song that is so sincerely happy, it's almost impossible to have a bad day after it. \n\nMy senior year, Mr. Brown spoke at our graduation breakfast. It was a small school, but all 132 seniors were there, along with all the teachers and a bunch of parents. Mr. Brown got up to the podium, and pulled a sweater out from a shelf inside. As he put it on, people were laughing and clapping. Then he started to sing, and every single student in that room joined in at full volume. I've never seen such confusion on the faces of parents. By the end, all the adults were singing, too, and a lot of the students were crying a little. \n\nMy long winded point is, there are still people trying to carry on what Fred Rogers started, and it makes a difference. Be one of them.\n\n\nCredit this comment to /u/jkersey who typed this in one of my TIL posts.\n\n",

He didn't put on a sweater or sing, but he spoke to us like *people*, while most of my other teachers treated us like children that they had to babysit, children that they were perpetually annoyed with. I understand that teaching, especially in a public school setting, is one of the hardest jobs. But the teachers who are able to talk to kids on their same level are just invaluable.",

He had already won his third Daytime Emmy, and now he went onstage to accept Emmy's Lifetime Achievement Award, and there, in front of all the soap-opera stars and talk-show sinceratrons, in front of all the jutting man-tanned jaws and jutting saltwater bosoms, he made his small bow and said into the microphone, \"All of us have special ones who have loved us into being. Would you just take, along with me, ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are\u2026.Ten seconds of silence.\" And then he lifted his wrist, and looked at the audience, and looked at his watch, and said softly, \"I'll watch the time,\" and there was, at first, a small whoop from the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that he wasn't kidding, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch but rather a man, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked\u2026and so they did. One second, two seconds, three seconds\u2026and now the jaws clenched, and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier, and Mister Rogers finally looked up from his watch and said, \"May God be with you\" to all his vanquished children.*\n\n\n",

            "comment": "From /u/talenphllips:\n\n&gt;On May 1, 1969 Fred Rogers, host of the longtime children's television landmark Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, appeared in Washington before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications to express his disagreement with a proposal by President Richard Nixon to cut federal funding for public broadcasting from $20 million to $10 million.\nHe addressed subcommittee chairman Senator John O. Pastore by outlining his submitted testimony, stating that \"one of the first things . . . a child learns in a healthy family is trust, and I trust . . . that you will read this. It's very important to me.\"\nRogers continued to detail the emotional impact that television had on children and how the medium could be used to provide a guiding influence to them. He said that his program's entire budget of $6,000 was equal to the cost of \"less than two minutes of cartoons,\" referred to by Rogers as \"animated . . . bombardment.\" Over the course of Rogers' passionate yet respectful testimony, Senator Pastore's gruff demeanor slowly softened. The chairman even said that, though he was \"supposed to be a pretty tough guy,\" Rogers' fervent plea had given him \"goosebumps.\" Pastore effused: \"I think it's wonderful. I think it's wonderful,\" and, after a slight pause, he made his conclusion clear: \"Looks like you just earned the twenty million dollars.\"\nMore than forty years later, Fred Rogers\u2019 compelling words about the power of television to help children grow up, dealing sensibly and humanely with others even when they are feeling angry, still resonate in living rooms, school rooms, and neighborhoods nationwide.",

His only really \"hostile\" remark was at the beginning with the passive aggressive, \"Would it make you happy if you read it?\" But keep in mind that he doesn't know who Mr. Rogers is, and Mr. Rogers does have a particular cadence and speaking style that the Congressman might have wrongly interpreted as snarky.\n\nWhen Mr. Rogers started really getting into describing what he does, the congressman rightly realizes that the guy truly cares, and he immediately requests a recording of the show to watch.\n\nI didn't get \"openly hostile\" at all. I saw both Mr. Rogers and the congressman doing their jobs - Mr. Rogers to accurately get across the importance of his programming, and the congressman to make an intelligent decision on how the government spends its money.\n",

Tomorrow I'm going to go to my very depressing and anger inciting job at a call help center and really really focus and try to respond and act and treat others the way this man would have. It's so hard sometimes that I think we forget or at least I do that it's just as hard for everyone else too. And I think we forget just how much a little help and a little caring can really make everyone's life better. I really needed to see this video right now. I really needed to stop and listen and think. Fred Rodgers is a real Hero, and I hope I can use this video to inspire me to be a better person, and I hope others will do the same. ",

It's all well and good to demand that those on the right open themselves up to hear what we have to say, but far too often what we have to say, and the way we choose to say it is designed only to chastise and reproach, make ourselves feel better. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe don't have to give up our convictions and our values to communicate with people on the right, but a change in vocabulary and approach can do a lot of good. Obviously it won't change anything if they refuse to listen to what we have to say and respond in kind, but we can hardly expect them to do so if our greeting is an attack.",

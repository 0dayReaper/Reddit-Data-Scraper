Absolutely amazing miniseries even though there were minor historical accuracies. \n\nI\u2019m not one to comment on wokeness or political correctness, but I\u2019m 10 minutes into it and are you fucking kidding me? Catherine of Aragon\u2019s mother personally escorted her and fought off a bunch of Moors trying to kill them?\n\nDoes this pick up or does it stay in this level of historical accuracy/ realism?",

The Spanish were pissed and absolutely hated this show, calling it an abomination and an insult to their country and history.",

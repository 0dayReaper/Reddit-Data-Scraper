Just an incredible series all around - I genuinely feel it's the best season of TV I've ever watched - but man, I still can't get that intro out of my head. Incredible incredible incredible.\n\nActing, music, atmosphere, all phenomenal. But that intro just seals it.",

There was much more but it really felt like they were building to something greater and then it just kind of fizzled out.",

He\u2019s going to have legal troubles all through his campaign. I think a lot of GOP are dropping him for DeSantis. Fundraising will be difficult. He bled his trailer trash WWF monster truck crowd dry already. Can\u2019t find lawyers. He\u2019s already burned a lot of bridges with  campaign and possible administration staff last time. His kids aren\u2019t helping him. This is going to be the end of Trump in politics. He will spend the rest of his life begging for money on Truth Social until he gets caught up in a crypto pyramid scheme and loses his last asset. Also, his primary opponents may be treating him with kid gloves in public, in private they\u2019re looking for dirt to destroy him. They may be better at coming up with it than political opponents would be. A lot of shit is going to come out",

If you want to talk about beating a dead horse, you should have watched late night talk shows during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Clinton impeachment. \n\nBut yeah, he did lay it on pretty thick in regards to Trump. Though he did seem to try to make an effort to scale that back a bit after Trump's presidency ended. \n\nIf you ignore the monologue though, there isn't much else on the show that is overtly political (except when his guests happen to be politicians, which is infrequent.) Most of his recurring segment have nothing to do with politics. \n\nI do think that his monologue is the weakest part of the show though, since it seems to just be variations on the exact same jokes everyone else is making that day based on whatever crazy news happened (often Trump related.)",

Colbert's character was a caricature of figures like Hannity, Beck, and O'Reilly. He was so good at portraying these people that even conservatives had to laugh at it. However, since going on the late show it's just straight \"republicans bad\" which is about as fresh as week old potato salad.",

The convenience of being able to watch it any time is appealing but when I have so much available to consume there\u2019s always something more interesting to binge. And now I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any great late night hosts. I may be wrong about that since I haven\u2019t seen any in forever but nobody seems to be talking about them either",

I\u2019m not denying that. However I would like you to remember two salient facts. Fact 1: nobody got hurt! Not a soul! Very important to keep that in mind. Fact 2: now the prosecution keeps dangling this term \u201ccriminal trespass\u201d.\u00a0Mr. Spinazo,\u00a0property owner, admitted to us that he keeps most portions of his business open to the public - both day and night. So trespassing? Bit of a reach, don\u2019t you think Dave?\n\nHere\u2019s what I know. These three young men, near honor students, were feeling their oats one Saturday night and they just went a little bananas. I don\u2019t know, call me crazy, but I don\u2019t think they deserve to have their bright futures ruined by a momentary, minute (points at the three boys) never to be repeated, lapse of judgement. Ladies and gentleman...you\u2019re bigger than that.",

He would pay top dollar to have them scrub stories about him and replace it with a story about Michael molesting a child or doing something weird/crazy. The rumor, though, is that he got his friend Oprah in on this as well and that's the reason why she was so critical of Jackson from 94 onwards. He was also friends with Sony head, Tommy Mottola, who squashed all promotions of Michael Jackson's last studio album, Invincible. \n\nHonestly, it might've been true when Michael said their was a conspiracy against him back in 2003 during that Ed Bradley interview.",

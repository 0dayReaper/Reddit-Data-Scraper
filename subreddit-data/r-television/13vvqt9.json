Granted, nobody really responds to it and possibly most people in the room had no idea what he was talking about. But if you rewatch the scene, he definitely says it!",

He's riding such a high on what's clearly an unachievable goal that he creates another unachievable goal. Wasn't it Frank he tries to pitch that to?

Hopefully they grow like Succession and we get more of both of them!\n\nNo word on Perry Mason s2 ratings from HBO which probably means it flopped and is toast.

The kids made the same familiar mistakes - but at least Roman got his crack at being Logan\u2019s favorite. Season 4, however, was constructed to hit every high this series could still muster.

The context matters a lot. It was always about kids showing time and again how undeserving they were to be the successors as Logan expected as they were not serious people and we see them get close to the throne and lose again and again but they all happen under different circumstances and different alliances with different stakes. The cyclical in nature with arcs of the characters but it was never a repetition. We needed those cyclical arc for these entitled narcissistic stubborn characters to finally be honest to themselves that they didn't earn anything in their life. \n\nRoman calling themselves bullshit and nothing was cathartic. It wouldn't have been impactful if we got that with linear arc. They aren't then type of people who change their nature significantly.",

Same dynamics, same arguments. It's true that this has a point in the story - telling us something about how this has probably been going on in a similar way for years before joined the characters and would probably continue for years after if the plot hadn't stopped them - but another loop around the track with new deals and back stabbings would have been too much. If you keep resetting everyone to their start positions after every \"big event\", future big events stop feeling important. IMO they were already kind of past that point by the time they got to season 4.",

Yes, it's an ending that makes sense for the characters if you assume they are never supposed to change or learn anything.

It was hours and hours of failed coups, and the same characters acting the exact same way, only for an outsider to come in and purchase a business. In the end the characters are all even more rich. It's weirdly low stakes with minimal development. For some, it's not enough to appreciate a pattern of behavior for 40 hours.",

It's about why they are bad, about childhood trauma and how it shapes who we are as people. It's about cycles of abuse. \"The posion drips down\" as the show says. It has plenty to say about family dynamics.\n\nIt speaks to how wealth corrupts, and how it insulates you from the real world. \n\nIt satirizes real life media empires.\n\nIf all you got from it was \"rich kids are shitty and bad\" I'd say that's a you problem rather than a problem with the show. Not enjoying it is one thing but saying it has \"nothing to say\" is just wrong.",

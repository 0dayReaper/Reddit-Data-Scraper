It was effectively canceled after season ten before they shockingly ordered more episodes.\n\nAs a fan watching it week-to-week it was brutal. They'd advertise new episodes in season 9 but they wouldn't air due to Fox Sports running long. S09 ending up being shortened so they made a 10th season out of the the remaining episodes and some new ones. They let it die on the vine.. but then ordered more because ratings remained steady. \n\nAlso \"To Sirloin with Love\" remains one of the best series finales in TV history. \n\nYup.\n",

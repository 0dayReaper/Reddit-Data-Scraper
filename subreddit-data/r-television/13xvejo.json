Also the last match was pretty boring and uninspired, the CGI was also somehow worse than usual (the whole season was a mess besides maybe two episodes, imho).",

I thought Ted Lasso was acceptable, but there were too many things that happened off screen. \n\n&gt;!i thought leaving Ted &amp; Michelle's, as well as Jamie/Roy &amp; keely, relationships ambiguous was a good call. Real life relationships are complicated and don't always have a clear path or answer. I'm glad they made it obvious Dr. Fuckhead was out of the picture though. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!what I didn't like was all the important moments they left off screen. Ted telling the team/management he's leaving, Nathan coming back to the team, etc. !&lt;\n\nWhat they did show was pretty solid, but I guess my criticism is more towards the entire last season than just the finale. Felt like there were subplots that just went nowhere and had no point. But I'm rewatching right now so my opinion may change.",

Consequently, it often goes too far with the comedic elements where it compromises the plot and logic so it weakens the dramatic elements. Barry has some interesting things to say, but it says it in a badly executed matter that cheapened the story and characters. S2-3 were really good, but this season wasn\u2019t at all IMO. It is nowhere close to Succession level which is the best show on TV since The Wire.",

Reddit\u2019s vote system is flawed in principle, and even when it \u201cworked\u201d in the bygone antiquity days, it\u2019s been compromised by the bots and South Asian upvote farms. Only numbers that matter are the zeros in your checking account and your tax deductibles.\n\nI\u2019ll validate your feelings about Succession. It\u2019s not even close to The Sopranos, let alone The Wire as compared by OP in terms of quality; writing, dialogue, structure, editing, cinematography, actor performances. Succession is no doubt a good TV show, but it\u2019ll never go down as a great. I also like how OP asks about the best series finale that occurred in the past most recent week, like the blatant dick riding is obvious. Honestly, let these people like Succession. Let them believe it\u2019s the best thing they ever watched. Most of these fans probably discovered HBO for the first time just like how they first discovered a nude magazine. Nah wait, giving them too much credit, these younger fans are probably inundated with TikTok twerkers.\n\nBecause I have this polarized (if you can call it polarized since Reddit means jack) view about Succession, I decided to rewatch the series couple days ago just to reinforce my thoughts or even concede that I might have been wrong or too harsh about the series. Did it shatter my notions? Not even a crack. Do yourself a favor and go watch the very first episode of Succession followed by the finale episode. Nothing changes; Logan Roy becomes incapacitated, Shiv doesn\u2019t want Kendall taking over, Roman is still Roman, like if there was an overarching arc in this grand odyssey of the best TV show ever produced, you could\u2019ve fooled me because none of it mattered.\n\nI will say though, Succession makes for a great background TV. I enjoy Tom and Greg banter as much as anyone but I will never sit down and rewatch the whole series just for snippets of dialogues scattered throughout the series. I can definitely leave it on and multitask. Succession was very much watchable and I enjoyed it, but this will never be considered great over The Sopranos, The Wire, and rest of the usual suspects when it comes to people ranking this kind of stuff.\n\nOne thing I wanna conclude with is, while the showrunners carbon copied the finale to the premier, they did plant a lot of seeds from the onset, especially when it comes to editing. The way Greg is introduced the very first time in contrast to Kendall who is seemingly on top of his game while Greg is in the trenches had potential there, alluding to the entire titular title of Succession. Unfortunately, we now all know how the series turned out. Succession could\u2019ve used another season for Greg\u2019s sake and him becoming the puppet CEO. Glad this show is over though. But we will still get threads like this until the award season ends.",

I can't even stand being in the same room as a TV that's running commercials. It just feels wrong on a fundamental level.\n\nI understand that a lot of people have to keep it just for sports. I'm not a fan, but they have my sympathies and I think it's ridiculous that sports aren't available online, ad-free. Fuck, they're basically advertisements in and of themselves, ads for tickets and merchandise.\n\nBut yeah. Commercials *anger* me.",

Pihole comes with a list of blacklisted domains used for advertisements. It's been ages since I've set mine up but it's worked wonders for me. You even save some bandwidth since the ads don't even load. I imagine it'll work differently for different people so be forewarned that it may not be the end-all-be-all for you specifically.",

One Saturday when my daughter was 5, I was out of work and watching how I spent my money. She wanted to watch \"new cartoons\". So I said, \"when I was a kid Cartoons were on regular TV on Saturdays.\" I turned to the regular broadcast TV.\n\nFirst thing that came up was a Trix cereal commercial. I switched the channel.\n\n\"PUT IT BACK!\" My daughter yells.\n\nSo I do, laughing and try to explain it's just a commercial. Then the commercial ends.\n\n\"PUT IT BACK! PUT IT BACK!\"\n\nI laughed so hard that she thought I changed the channel. It took a long time to explain commercials. We hate them to this day. As a matter of fact, I buy quite a bit of digital content. I'll not be buying TV shows from FX because they embed a commercial at the beginning of my digital purchase. You can fast forward thankfully, but I shouldn't have to.",

Usually on TV, all of that is cut and the ads end just in time for the whistle :(",

Hell, star trek Picard was made for CBS all access and never aired on TV and they felt the need to do it. Like it made sense on shows where you had a two part episode and you might need some more information on what's going on while it was normally self contained episodes. However, with shows being so narratively driven nowadays and every show having season long plot lines who the fuck is watching them out of order or forgetting what happened.",

It\u2019s a concept called \u201cnative advertising,\u201d and we\u2019re going to see an explosion of it over the next few years. The insidious thing about it is that they take b-plots and wrap them up with them so you can\u2019t/won\u2019t skip them. Here is an example: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E_RwUWpRjbQ\n\nBecause it\u2019s moving forward the episode B plot about the main characters marital fight it makes the commercial integral viewing. But notice the dialog and the camera are designed around selling you the features of the car.

The plot stops as the characters gush over the car's features for 30 seconds or so.  It's obvious it's an ad and it's worse than an old-style commercial break because it ruins immersion in the story.",

They're better commercials than the actual commercials they air.\n\nEven worse are placements like New Girl where 6'6\" Steve Agee raves about how roomy the new Ford Fusion is while Damon Wayans Jr. creams his jeans about the fact that it shows you your average MPG like every other car in the last decade.  Pretty sure Castle had some atrocious ones too.",

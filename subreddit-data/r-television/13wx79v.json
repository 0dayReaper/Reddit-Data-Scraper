Many of the things they do will leave marks on their body that can be easily pointed out as sexual abuse. But the consent part is what makes it difficult specially in a long relationship like they say that he was doing this with her for years. Many people point at documentaries or exposes as \"evidence\" but thoae things doesn't necessarily have the whole burden of proof. You can easily steer things toward one direction but that doesn't mean it's the real truth.\n\nI don't know he might be done done but he needs heavy rehabilitation not only for himself but for his image, and since h has children I just hope he does it for them. Working this type of cases in real life I can say they are never black and white as people want to paint them in the media.",

We kind of explored that space together, but our relationship was chaotic. \n\nWe would agree on scenes she wanted to do, we had safewords, everything and it was fine. But the moment she split and I became the worst person on the planet she would berate me with accusations of abuse and threats of telling everyone about her bruises. I lived in absolute fear that it would get out. And a few times it actually did and I lost entire swaths of our mutual friend group. \n\nAfter we broke up, a few mutuals in the scene called her out on her bullshit and blacklisted her from meetups because she posted photos of her bruises on her Facebook saying she was a victim of domestic abuse, but she had also previously posted the same exact pictures of her bruises that she was \"proud\" of on Fetlife. Some of the bruises had come from meetups and not even me. They shut that shit down quick with screenshots from fetlife and her own comments on Fetlife and everything, and I truly think that's part of what saved me from long lasting accusations and police involvement, because before they stepped in I was starting to get some heat from her friends and family.\n\nThose same mutuals had not believed me when she was spreading that I was abusive, but after she pulled that shit they reached out to make amends, so at least there was that, but at that point I was over it.",

There are many in the world who know who he is, go to see his movies, and have no ideas about him personally.  \n\n\n\nArmie Hammer is not an A-Lister or a proven global draw.  He's just some trust-fund schmuck that only people who like movies and television would really know off the top of their head, and most of those same people have likely seen and heard the stories about him.  \n\n\n\nIt's not really a fair comparison.   \"Cancel culture\" isn't a thing and obviously people overlook the worst in humanity to enjoy whatever it is they want.   But, it always comes down to...\n\n\n&gt; Transgression vs. Worth\n\n\n\nTom Cruise has been accused of doing bad shit, but he's worth a lot, to studios, to audiences, to advertisers.   So, the world lets him keep going.   Armie Hammer has been accused of bad shit, but he's not worth anything to anyone beyond what he stands to inherit from his family.   It's just that simple",

He\u2019s living in the Cayman Islands to be near his wife and kids and is selling timeshares and managing an apartment complex. Pretty big step down from being on track to become one of the A-list actors of his generation. But he\u2019ll never not be wealthy since he comes from old oil money.",

He then left with no concern for my well-being.\"\n\n&gt;The woman's attorney, Gloria Allred, said they had given evidence to Los Angeles police, including photos of the woman's injuries. Allred declined to say when they made the report, and would not confirm that it was the one made in February that the LAPD is investigating.\n\n&gt;The woman was 20 when she and Hammer met on Facebook and began a relationship in 2016, and they had their last contact last year, Allred said.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt; \u201cAlright, buckle your seatbelt. This is going to be the bet. If I won, I get to come over to your house with my bag of goodies,\u201d Hammer\u2019s voice is heard saying in the series, in an alleged voice message. \u201cMy bet was going to involve showing up to your place and completely tying you up and incapacitating you and then being able to do whatever I wanted to every single hole in your body until I was done.\u201d\n\n&gt; I decide when you eat, when you sleep,\u201d an alleged text read from Hammer, as show on-screen. Hammer appeared to often call his sexual partners \u201ckitten\u201d and in one message allegedly referred to a woman as, \u201cMy own personal little slave.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cYou are mine! You hear me? I own you now. I\u2019ll own you forever,\u201d another unverified text of Hammer\u2019s read.\n\n&gt;Julia Morrison, an artist who says she was contacted by Hammer on Instagram, appears on-camera in the docuseries to share some of the messages she says she received from the actor.\n\n&gt;\u201cI have a fantasy about having someone prove their love and devotion and tying them up in a public place at night and making their body free use\u2026And seeing if they will fuck strangers for me,\u201d Morrison read aloud, reading her texts.\n\n&gt;In another text, Morrison stated that Hammer wrote, \u201cYou don\u2019t think or worry about anything except being a good little pet. My own personal little slave\u2026 in return you will be worshipped, fed and fucked.\u201d\n\n&gt; Before they had ever met in-person, Vucekovich says Hammer showed up at her apartment in Dallas, Texas and sent her a photo of the building. This came after he called her 22 times in a row, she claims. \u201cLEAVE,\u201d Vucekovich texted Hammer in all caps. \u201cWHY ARE YOU THERE,\u201d she wrote. She claims Hammer responded, \u201cTrying to find your scent.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cI remember being like, \u2018Are we flirting? Or is this scary?\u2019\u201d Vucekovich says on-camera.\n\n&gt;Hammer then sent her photos of the entrance of her building and texted, \u201cI\u2019m going in. Nothing you can do to stop me.\u201d He left her a note. When she opened the envelope, it read, \u201cI am going to bite the fuck out of you\u201d with his signature.\n\n&gt; Vucekovich, who is the main accuser in \u201cHouse of Hammer,\u201d claims that Hammer tracked her location on his phone. One day, when she was on a walk with a friend, Hammer showed up on his scooter, she says.\n\n&gt;\u201cI fell right back into it,\u201d Vucekovich admits. \u201cI thought it was romantic. I thought, \u2018He\u2019s fighting for me.\u2019\u201d https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/armie-hammer-text-messages-house-of-hammer-women-sexual-allegations-cannibal-1235358967/",

As someone who has been on both sides of dom-sub interactions, all that language and bravado barely fazes me. I've heard it and said it myself (except for the biting part and the tying someone in public part, but I have seen those as well on other people)\n\nAll this could actually be ok if done with a consenting partner, if Armie had simply taken the time of exploring his options until he found a partner that wanted it.\n\nYou can bet there are submissive women who would want to have this kind of relationship with a guy, even more so if he's hot, rich and famous. All he had to do was search for them and build this relationship in a safe, sane and consensual way. And instead, he decided to try to force it onto multiple unwilling women.\n\nThat's the problem here, not the kink but the disregard of consent.",

They know the case will likely go before an older judge with less evolved standards of what constitutes assault than the average college student. Or jurors may look askance at any victim who isn't a nun.\n\nIt's a high standard to bear, and it really sucks for victims. \n\nThat said, the evidence of a [consensual ongoing relationship](https://airmail.news/issues/2023-2-4/armie-hammer-breaks-his-silence) with Hammer and his main accuser would have made this a really hard case to successfully prosecute.",

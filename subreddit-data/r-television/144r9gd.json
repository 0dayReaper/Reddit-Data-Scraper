Innocent people do not settle for that much unless they are deep down actually afraid of losing the lawsuit. Even more so when during the trial itself they were called out repeatedly for lying and omitting evidence.",

It seems the \"rendering services\" part is the massive grey area, not that Twitter can be called a network. If you are a TV personality that has garnered  a brand with a very specific viewpoint under your former employer, then  set up an  independent show saying the exact same things as you did under the contract, Would that be considered breach of contract?\n\nI mean, I doubt that Fox would give a shit if he went on  another network and suddenly started doing a sitcom centered around him married to the Green M&amp;M, or started up a YouTube channel reviewing Yankee Candles, it seems they're more pressed about the content of his show more than anything.",

It has 3.3k upvotes  within 2 hours of being posted, the only other post that has more than 1k upvotes was about that evangelist guy who died. If you look at the posts of the last week the highest rated posts are highly political, some of which are posts about major news networks anchors which seems strange. The WGA stuff is relevant and makes sense so that's ok. You have to about 10 posts down before a single one is actually about a real television show or actor. Pretty clear r/all astroturfing being done, that way when you look at r/all your inundated with the same information from 10 different subreddits",

Story has been super predictable lately and the only mystery that actually intrigues me (what\u2019s the deal outside the silo?) that they tease all through the first episode and barely touch upon again. I get that they\u2019re gonna work their way back but it just doesn\u2019t feel well executed IMO. I\u2019m intrigued by the world lore but everything else has been kinda meh to me.",

But right now there is so few that ill take any i can get lol, especially because so far it seems they at least give their writers a chance to finish their story. I cant imagine they were very happy with the numbers they were getting from See vs cost but at least they gave them a s3 to wrap things up. I literally cant get invested in netflix shows anymore and dont bother checking out their series unless they are already finished and i can decide whether im ok with a cliffhanger or if ill skip an unfinished story.",

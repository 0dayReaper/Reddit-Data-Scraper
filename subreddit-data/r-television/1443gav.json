    "postText": "I love The Leftovers, like both Lost and Watchmen.\n\nLindelof knows how to write interesting characters, but without source material his writing almost consistently gets stuck writing around the trap of a central mystery that most of his writing is based around.\n\nIn the case of The Leftovers you can see between season 1 and 2 when the actual book the show was based on ended and Lindelof started to indulge himself a bit too much(which can verge on silliness). I liked episodes of season 2 better but season 1 as a whole was probably the best and most consistent season because the book was narratively straight forward. \n\nWhen Lindelof is at its best it's small screen gold and when he is at his worst it is just meandering frustration. I find almost all his best episodes are character based with very little about the overarching plot, examples would be 'International Assasin' and 'This Extraordinary Being'",

            "comment": "Love Lost. Quite like Mrs. Davis (I have two episodes left though, so my feelings could change). Liked The Leftovers okay. Haven't tried Watchmen yet.\n\nWhile I definitely think it's accurate to say that The Leftovers had a central mystery (and from my understanding of Watchmen, that might be the case with it as well), I wouldn't say that Lost had a central mystery as much as it did several connected mysteries. (The closest thing it had to a central mystery was resolved by Season 2 or 3.) And Mrs. Davis is an even lesser form of that.\n\nOverall I like Lindelof, but I think he needs a good writing partner to really make his ideas shine.",

I think The Leftovers was his first show post-LOST, and in an interview he made it clear from the jump that he would not be answering the question of \"what happened\".  I think that was appealing to him to be able to continue writing in mysterious circumstances and not having to explain or \"answer questions\".",

His stories don't lead anywhere. Watchmen is one of the most disappointing shows I've ever watched. It started very promising, mystery was presented well, the plot seemed interesting. It had a few exceptional, really well done, close to perfect episodes on their own, but the overall show was a mess.",

                    "comment": "Wow, I also don\u2019t care much for Lindelof, I thought The Leftovers was average and the veneer of Lost came off when the series ended but unlike you, I enjoyed his Watchmen sequel. Although I feel like Moore\u2019s original work is untouchable even with the numerous adaptations and additional comics diminishing it, I do think Lindelof did his best with continuity. He did a great job respecting Moore\u2019s work even though Moore himself won\u2019t agree or ever admit that it was well executed. Those unfortunate reports that leaked Lindelof acting pretentious with Moore certainly didn\u2019t help his standing within the die hard fan community of the original work.\n\n&gt; Per the Watchmen co-creator, Lindelof sent him a self-deprecating letter that attempted to recognize Moore\u2019s gripes while establishing a connection. \u201cDear Mr. Moore, I am one of the bastards currently destroying Watchmen,\u201d Moore said the letter began.\n\n&gt; \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the best opener,\u201d noted Moore. \u201cIt went on through a lot of, what seemed to me to be, neurotic rambling. \u2018Can you at least tell us how to pronounce \u201cOzymandias?\u201d \u2018 I got back with a very abrupt and probably hostile reply telling him that I\u2019d thought that Warner Bros. were aware that they, nor any of their employees, shouldn\u2019t contact me again for any reason.\u201d\n\n&gt; Moore continued, \u201cI explained that I had disowned the work in question, and partly that was because the film industry and the comics industry seemed to have created things that had nothing to do with my work, but which would be associated with it in the public mind. I said, \u2018Look, this is embarrassing to me. I don\u2019t want anything to do with you or your show. Please don\u2019t bother me again.\u2019\u201d",

And of course Watchmen is not only not based on the source material but he had a lot of skepticism going into making the show and nailed it. \n\nI can get your point on him being a bit inconsistent but would not come close to as far as saying he can be one of the worst showrunners in TV. I mean just go watch the last few seasons of The Flash and tell me Lindelof is seriously a bad showrunner sometimes.",

Jeremy Irons was good in the role but it really bogged down the pacing of anything else happening for a character that only really impacts the plot in the very last episode. \n\nI think this is because Lindelof being a fan of the comic really wanted to know what happened to Ozymandias after the book but did not know how to write this into the story in an organic way until the very end. Which is kind of what I fund tedious about the way he tells his stories narratively sometimes.\n\nI still liked Watchmen and found that it captured the feeling of the graphic novel but stuff like that brought it down.",

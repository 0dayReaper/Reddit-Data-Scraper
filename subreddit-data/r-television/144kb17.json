An action scene with them driving around (assuming the show has those) would've been a much better reveal.  I'm guessing they just wanted to show off Arnett as Sweet Tooth.",

Like I know they weren't going to actually have a lot of car scenes (what's the point then?) but I figured the other scenes would be compelling. This just doesn't \"feel\" like the TM I remembered.\n\nAm I wrong though? His his back and forth with Mackie similar to whatever the humor is in the more modern games?",

By the end of the series a regular demon was barely a minor level threat whereas in the first season a single demon was like a mini-boss every time. You can't expect your audience to just be scared of standard demons again.",

A single ghost in a first season episode could be made the most terrifying thing. By the fifteenth season, you could literally have a whole town full of ghosts and it would be, \"Meh,\" at best. \n\nThe problem is there is no Rules Bible to this show. The supernatural elements became whatever whichever showrunner felt like going with at the time. So, yes, in the first season a Reaper was unsettling and creepy. (I loved how they didn't talk and their inhuman design.) By the end of the show's run, they were just regular people with a \"book keeping\" job. They were anything but scary. Thing is, you can blame the show runners past season five but even toward the end of Kripke's run, the show became less horror and more urban fantasy. The introduction of Angels sealed that. Especially with Angels like Cupid. He was just silly. Not scary.",

My idea is, there\u2019s a new threat and now monsters are getting into the uk, so they have to change how they\u2019ve been doing things, especially since they got their asses kicked in America. So they manage to bring a few young American hunters into Kendrick\u2019s. They could even use a coupe of the characters from the show, like Claire or Chrissy. The juxtaposition of the rough American hunters with the prudish Brit\u2019s would be great. There could be a teacher that\u2019s secretly a monster, corruption going all the way up, I mean, it would be a terrific show. Hell, bring what\u2019s her names son into it, he\u2019d be old enough to be a student. Lady Bevell, that was it. They could bring back Ketch, have him be a teacher. It kills me that they did the Winchester instead.",

Any Supernatural show without those three involved is a really tough sell to begin with. \n\nAlso, I think they waited too long to reveal what the show was really about. If they had marketed it as a continuation of the main show rather than a spinoff featuring younger versions of characters nobody wanted to see more of, the audience may have been more interested or willing to be more patient to see things unfold. That would have allowed them to being back more core characters people actually liked earlier in the run.",

We got enough of their backstory during the show\u2019s run, and they were unpopular characters among most of the fanbase at that. The fanbase is also aging and aren\u2019t interested in a teen drama show, and the show failed to attract the new teen audience it was going for. \n\nAll those things together spelled failure from the very beginning. The only Supernatural spinoff that will work must include more of the core characters people loved, be darker and grittier, and Sam and Dean must be more involved in the story.",

The directing was always serviceable/mediocre, Jensen Ackles was the only really solid actor (Sometimes Jared brought it, Mischa was alright and Jim Beaver was good enough but both Ruby's were trash and none of the side characters would ever win an Emmy) and a bunch of those monster of the week episodes were too weakly written to be enjoyed.\n\nI think to be a \"best damn show ever made\" you kinda need the best acting, filming and writing but Supernatural never hit any of those. Don't get me wrong though because I love the genre and those first 5 seasons.",

Imagine a season following new hunters during different points of the original show as they go from \"We can take down a ghost, no big\" to \"IT'S A HIGH RANKING GOD THAT THE WINCHESTERS LET LOOSE!\".",

Naturally after he went through all that he then made a backup plan. The bugs were designed to travel through the multiverse and erase all life making it a clean slate and they were so vast and innumerable that even Amara wouldn't be able to keep up with them.

So perhaps the Queen acted as an anchor, allowing beings of such great power to exist freely through the multiverse (and to remain hidden from Jack until the multiverse was recreated).",

John was completely oblivious as he was away in the military during most of the time she was old enough to start hunting, and when they got together she retired completely and lived a completely normal life and never told him any of what she had been doing. He had no idea, when she was alive, that she or her family were hunters.\n\nHe learns about all that's going on after she dies because he is grief stricken and tries to figure out what's up, and Missouri the psychic (the boys meet her pretty early on like episode 4 or 5?) basically just lays it out to him what's going on. He becomes obsessive and it goes from there.",

People in the 70s still had feelings like grief\u2026 and they still talked about those feelings; they just didn\u2019t talk about them like they were aliens dropped into this timeline from 2023.",

            "comment": "For me it was how they characterized John. In Supernatural he was, for lack of a better term, an asshole. He was cruel, mean, kept his friends and family at a distance, oftentimes worked alone and had a single minded focus on one thing - killing Yelow Eyes.\n\nSo to see him played as part of a group of hunters was kind of off putting. To have that close knit group of hunters also be super diverse while maintaining that level of closeness to John felt unbelievable in context to his early Supernatural character arc.\n\nIf they had kept the group of hunters as a separate entity with the same level of prominence in the show but less buddy buddy with John maybe I could see it be more in line with his arc, as I really did think there was something there. But forcing the friendship felt inauthentic. All in all I wont miss this show.",

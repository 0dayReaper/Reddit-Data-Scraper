    "postText": "I feel like it was around the time House of Cards Season 3, orange is the new black season 3, Daredevil Season 1 dropped. Netflix were on a roll content wise. But I can't pinpoint what exactly changed from the perspective of viewers to want to go back to week to week content at that specific point in time. Could it be that Game of Thrones was at all time high with season 5 and Better Call Saul came out that year to and was giving us quality tv each week reminding us of how it used to be?",

I watched both so fast that afterwards I felt like I hadn't processed or appreciated them properly and had to do an immediate rewatch at a slower pace. \n\nSo I'm not necessarily pushing for a weekly release model but I did come to the realisation that bingeing is a poor way to consume a tv series. Like I don't feel good about it afterwards and memory recollection is noticeably worse. So now I try stretch it out to a week rather than a few days.\n\nOf course a weekly release model naturally alleviates this issue with the added benefit of longer exposure and increased likelihood of renewal.",

You\u2019d have a big surge of popularity for 2 weeks then your show is just dead from any online talk until you tease the next season trailer two years later. If people aren\u2019t taking about the show it\u2019s hard to bring in new viewers. \n\nWith weekly releases it creates engagement online for weeks or even months. Your show stays on the minds of people for 2-3 months. It builds up anticipation and hype. It\u2019s easier to gain new viewers as People have time to join in through the run and not feel like they miss out.m\n\nI myself began to detest it when spoilers were posted within an hour of the binge dump. People literally going to the final episode just to spoil everyone. You also cannot talk about the show until you see the entire thing lest you risk running into spoilers and most people cannot watch an entire season in one sitting. At least with weekly releases I have one episode I have to watch and if I am spoiled on that one episode the entire season isn\u2019t still ruined for me by revealing the end. \n\nPlus I love community engagement. I was huge into Lost it\u2019s initial run because of how active the community discussion was. I enjoy discussing episodes and theories and all that is lost in a binge dump. Weekly just allows more discussion.",

I mean sure there\u2019s shows that I\u2019m excited about but honestly The Sandman could\u2019ve worked as a weekly release. Also, the quality of Netflix originals has gone down tremendously. There\u2019s good stuff in there for sure but to go from House of Cards season 1 to Money Heist season 4 is a huge step down. For a while it looked like Netflix would rival HBO. But they wanted a wider audience so they went for the teen crowd but didn\u2019t really pay attention to quality with a lot of stuff. I mean I don\u2019t hate their teen shows, stuff like Wednesday, Stranger Things or Never Have I Ever are great, but they feel like exceptions. And I rarely start any new Netflix show unless it\u2019s a hit, because they\u2019re cancelling so much of them. Just release less and advertise more if you are gonna be cancelling so many of your shows.",

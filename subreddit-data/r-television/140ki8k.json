    "postText": "Seeing the start of this season of The Other Two made me realize all the shows that were ever going to talk about Covid are pretty much done covering it. Maybe the only show left that might still have some Covid story left to address is The Morning Show and, honestly, that\u2019s a show I watch for the production value and acting - not necessarily the story, and especially after seeing their take on #MeToo I don\u2019t have high hopes.\n\nWho do you think did the best job? Personally, I thought The Connors was the most realistic to my personal experience - they let it continue through multiple episodes and in one episode they did a good job of covering the awkwardness of someone in your family getting Covid and trying to figure out how it happened. Kind of funny considering the cast and some of the guest stars on The Connors that I thought Shameless was a solid second runner up for how they handled it and the balance of drama and comedy.\n\nMost other shows kind of shoe horned it in for 2 episodes and then pretended it was over. Even shows that had characters working in the medical field seemed to gloss over it.\n\nPersonally I think the funniest retrospectives were The Other Two and the 3rd season of Party Down. \n\nThe biggest fumble felt like This is Us - the triplets were an actor on the verge of finally being taken seriously, a new mom, and a black city councilor. There was SO MUCH opportunity for story there and they kind of treated Covid like a temporary distraction and went back to the storylines the creators seemed more interested in.",

Three years in and the world has pretty much forgotten it.  Ignoring it makes the seasons more evergreen.\n\nOne that mentioned it but mostly ignored it was Last Man Standing.  Their time skip turned out to be accurate.  Skip a few years and it's pretty much never addressed in day-to-day conversation.  The show itself went downhill after the first cancellation and I gave up on it before the final season was done, but the COVID handling turned out well.\n\nSuperstore addressed it best for shows that didn't ignore it.  For a show with such absurd characters, they addressed COVID realistically.",

It couldn't have happened without the pandemic because the show is about prisoners being let out due to the virus and then forming a crew and doing crime and other shenanigans. The main character is a guy who went to prison in the 90s - imagine not knowing anything about the world and being let out when the world doesn't even know what's going on with a virus. It's comedy gold but it's also grounded and balanced laughs with emotional beats. Hands down my favorite show covering this time period.",

Them all being the same is more about consistency for their audience than being unique or quality news and entertainment. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m about to enter my 60s but a lot of TV growing up was based on being able to consistently and repetitively help people pass the time it wasn\u2019t designed to be one of their main sources of entertainment or news thus it lends itself more to being sloppier and less refined kind of like a B movie actually.",

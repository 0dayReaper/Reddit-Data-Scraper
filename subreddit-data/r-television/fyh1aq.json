In the middle of all this personal drama, you learn very little about how the tigers are actually being treated, with the exception of doc antle killing his tigers and joe exotics mass fuck ups. The documentary implies that she mistreats her tigers because she feeds them through cages, but when you get an aerial view of the zoo it's a huge piece of land that's fully available for12 tigers to roam through. Not to mention multiple accounts of people who visited the zoo and who expressed that big cat rescue was misrepresented in the show.",

I like how they included that in the edit so you could see how controlling he is in person.\n\nEdit: since everyone is getting on my ass about it, I just called him doc because that's what he's called in the documentary. Everyone chill, I'm literally pointing out how shitty he is, but I guess that's not enough. I added quotes now. I didnt even call him doctor, PhD or MD, but you guys are clearly very educated.",

There are six living tiger subspecies, but the majority of privately owned tigers in the US are mixes. They're referred to as \"generic\" tigers and don't have the same legal protections. It is perfectly legal to own those.\n\nEdit: double checked and I was wrong, the generic tiger loophole was closed in 2016. That said, laws are still too lax in many states, and even with strict laws, enforcement can be difficult.",

Without a doubt there were a lot of good people but we\u2019re talking about the big cat owners here. This series highlighted not only animal rights issues, but the exploitation of lonely or naive people. From my opinion Mario didn\u2019t come across as the type of guy to exploit people like the rest of the tiger owners.

Either way he showed a shocking level of perspective throughout the series. The wisest cat in the show\n\nEdit edit: It seems Saff [doesn't identify as a trans man but does prefer to go by \"he.\"](https://www.out.com/television/2020/4/01/tiger-kings-saff-still-wants-best-animals) I'm only adding this for the sake of accuracy. As far as Saff goes he doesn't really care what people call him. Let's take his advice and not focus on that so much as the content of his character. Let's be respectful, people!",

And Doc Antle needs his own doc cuz Jesus he\u2019s insane. Joe was interesting but clearly a shit human. Everyone who worked for him hates him now for a reason but no one seems to care about that for some reason. He barely showed emotion when his employee was still bleeding out on his property. And barely cared when his own husband died. This reminds me of when chicks were hot to Ted Bundy. People are stupid like that lol",

There was a part of the doc where they show Joe staff about to feed the cats and they were all in this one pin. It was an ocean or rippling fur. They were just passing back and forth and it was just just incredible in the worst way. I've never seen that many big cats in one place before. It's just not meant to.be that way. It's depressing",

The gist was that they came up with a plan to bring the animals into Congress to get photo-ops with lawmakers that way if there is a new big cat ban bill the lawmakers who got their pictures with the cats now wouldn't be able to vote for it otherwise it would show they were hypocrites.

But she said the lion, Joseph, had just wandered from his 4,000-square-foot enclosure into the narrow feeding chute and was free to wander back out.\"\n\nThis really stuck with me during the show. Joe screams about this and they show a cat in one of these narrow areas drinking, and then they cut away. But earlier on the show it was very visually clear that they go into that area to feed and then leave. No one forces them in there, they're not stuck in there, etc.\n\nThe show had opportunities to highlight visuals that contradicted Joe as he was saying these things, but often didn't even bother. Same with how many cats were in the enclosures. Half of the shots of cats at these other \"zoos\" have six plus cats practically piling on each other.",

These animals cannot be reintegrated into the wild or they would die. A sanctuary does it's best to let the tiger live out its life healthy and in peace and in the best conditions possible. They are not bred or allowed to be touched and guests can only observe. I've been to a big cat sanctuary twice in Branson and they operate similar to Carole. On tour they give lots of info on each cat personally and generally talk about how we can reduce harm we involuntarily inflict on big cats in the wild. Like consuming palm oil encourages the destruction of tigers homes. They also talked about the harm of these zoos and even mentioned terrible zoos in OK. At the time I went tiger king wasnt a thing but looking back I think our guide was talking about Joe exotic.",

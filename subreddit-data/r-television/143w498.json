            "comment": "2005ish to 2015ish TBS syndication was literally the background noise in my house growing up. At my dad's house we were in eat in front of the TV family most night when I was in middle and high school. For years it was Friends on in the late afternoon, a couple hours of Seinfeld around dinner time, then Family Guy around 8:00pm as our night started to wind down. TBS got the early season syndication of The Office too so there were a few years where that came on at 9:00 and I fell asleep to that. In the mornings it was what we watched before school and I remember 3 distinct periods in my childhood, Saved By The Bell in elementary school, The Drew Carey Show in early middle school, and then Married...with Children in late middle school/high school. Right after school might have been my favorite tho, I loved that rotating syndication of shows over the years that introduced me to so many sitcoms I was too young to have seen in primetime, Just Shoot Me, Yes Dear, The Fresh Prince just off the top of my head.\n\nOriginal programing always left something to be desired but My Boys was good for a few years. I do hate what they turned TBS into, it was *the* cable channel for me for a long time and now I don't think I have flipped to TBS in literally a year.",

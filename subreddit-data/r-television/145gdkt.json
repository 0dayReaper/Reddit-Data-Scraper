Yes, the original cast is great, but the cast being great isn't why the show is so well revered, most of them were not well known before and even during the airing of the show. A show can have a great cast but suck because the writing lets it down. S4 is the perfect example of this. It has the full original cast but the creator, executive producer, and multiple writers were gone during that season, and you feel it. It's not near the same quality of show as S5 or 6 without the full original cast.\n\nAgain, it is a **perceived** drop in quality because you got attached to the characters, but the quality is objectively still there as evidenced by S5 and 6's very positive reviews on any website you look at.\n\nAs someone who watched the show when it originally aired, I've noticed that it's usually newer viewers who binge watched it for the first time that think the last two seasons drop in quality. The difference being time between episodes and seasons to accept the cast departures. Because when it originally aired, we knew before the season that Donald was leaving, we knew we had 5 episodes with him and that he'd have a final episode. We had time when it was announced, we had time between the episodes and for other cast departures we also had time between seasons to accept it and move past it. Whereas with binge watching, it all happens in fast succession and they have no time to process it. They just go \"it's not the same\" and don't really give it a proper chance.\n\nBut the last two seasons are phenomenal in my opinion. S5 is actually my 2nd favorite season of the series. And it bums me out that some people really don't give them a real chance just because a few characters leave.",

You **perceive** that season 5 and 6 are as good, but I **perceive** that they aren't. That's the entire basis of opinions. I however am backing my opinion up with facts - on average the highest rated and most-often talked about episodes almost exclusively happen during seasons 1 through 3. Prove me wrong, just don't act like your opinion is somehow **more valid** than anyone else's. \n\nAs for all this other gatekeeping fluff where you allude that true original fans \"had time to prepare\" and \"had time to move on\", that's just meaningless self-gratification where you try to put yourself (once again) above others to help give weight to your personal **opinion**. I watched it live - just like you - and 5 and 6 just aren't as good. I'm sorry, but they aren't, and no amount of changnesia will change that. There isn't one Remedial Chaos Theory in there no matter how hard you try.",

I'm not saying you are wrong or that I'm right. All I'm doing is pointing out is that our perceptions are different most likely due to the way we watched it. You say you watched it live, that's fine. I made an assumption because it seems that most people I come across with that opinion had binged watched it their first time. But I never said this was the case for everyone.\n\nYou said \"they do drop in quality\" in your first reply which is why I highlighted \"perceived\" exactly because it sounded like you were saying that objectively but it's just your perception. \n\nAs for backing up opinions with fact, like I said, Seasons 5 and 6 are both rated higher on Rotten Tomatoes than S4 with S5 also being rated higher than S1 and S3. And if you look at IMDB, S5 has multiple 9+ rated episodes and multiple 8+ rated episodes as well, pretty well in line with the first three seasons even with a lesser amount of episodes. The cast used a S5 episode as their table read in 2020, and there are bunch of talked about and quoted episodes from the last two seasons. I'm not sure if you are on /r/community, but the last two seasons are brought up a lot.\n\nAlso, I'm not trying to gatekeep. You read that into what I said, but it was not my intent. My intent was to show how perception can be different because of how the show was experienced for many people. I'm not a better fan for having watched it earlier, I never said that. I don't see how explaining how and why perceptions may be different could possibly be saying that I'm better than you or anyone else?\n\nI brought up the \"time to accept\" character departures because it's true in many ways. Binge watching doesn't provide that time to process the changes. And overall, the last two seasons were better received when they originally aired than by many who view them today from what I've seen.\n\nIt's funny how you say that I'm talking objectively and gatekeeping but then you say things like \"5 and 6 just aren't as good. I'm sorry but they aren't, nothing can change that no matter how hard you try\". That's *your* opinion, mine differs. But objectively, they are highly rated seasons. And it's also funny that you brought up the single highest rated episode of the series as if everything should be able to match that. There is only one Remedial Chaos Theory, and it sits within a season that overall is not as highly reviewed as S5. Remedial Chaos Theory is objectively the best episode of the show, but it's not even my personal favorite. My favorite is Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. S2 is also my favorite season of the show.\n\nAll of this to say that it just bums me out that S5 and 6 don't get the respect they deserve. You have the right to dislike them as I have the right to love them. Neither of us are \"right\". But since I do love them, I wish others like you could see what I see. I don't see the harm in trying to help people see them in a different light to enjoy them. I'm trying to do something positive. It's not like I'm trying to make you hate something.\n\nYou took my comment all wrong. I didn't mean it the way you took it. I just want people to enjoy the last two seasons, that's all. They are great in my opinion.",

They were great, but the strongest episodes, the best storylines and the most memorable moments almost exclusively come from the first 3 seasons. \n\nJust check out IMDB's rating breakdown of every episode: \n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/search/title/?series=tt1439629&amp;sort=user_rating,desc&amp;count=250&amp;view=simple\n\nLook at those bangers:\n\n- Remedial Chaos Theory\n- Modern Warfare\n- Advanced Dungeons and Dragons\n- Epidemiology (Abba Zombie episode)\n\nThese are pretty much indisputably some of the (if not absolutely) best episodes of the show ever made. The episodes that you tell someone to watch if they are on the fence. The episodes that you quote and rhyme off with a flurry when someone questions Community's ability. They are the episodes that you re-watch randomly on a whim and suck you back into an entire revisit. \n\nOther than Troy's last episode and the finale, 4-6 don't really have the same amount of draw. I love the Ass-crack bandit and seeing Jeff as a GI Joe, but it doesn't compare to the overwhelming meta-explosion of committing an entire episode to 8-bit videogame glory or 1950s christmas claymation insanity. \n\nI just don't see much in season 5 or 6 that even compares with an entire episode dedicated to mashing Chicken Fingers with Goodfellas - and absolutely nailing it. Still great seasons, but 1-3 is where the sausage is made.",

To all those apologists who are going to come at me, I'm not saying that all jokes about race and racism are inherently racist/unfunny (iirc there are a couple good ones in the show), it's just that a number of them in Community are racist and therefore age badly. There's some sexist humor too that doesn't hold up, but iirc it's not as bad, or at least it isn't quite as cringe-y to me (maybe there were some white women writers?). This could also be in part bc I feel like the women (and the show itself) critique/make fun of sexism more than the racism.",

Second half of 3 is just bullying pierce for the sin of being played by chevy chase who did a fantastic job the whole series. 4 is decent, better than a lot of comedy shows. 5 is better than 4. 6 is fun but still the magic was in the whole cast.\n\nMy problem is a theory i have about what i dislike in movies of today. The intertextuality and meta-ness of the humor worked in community because it never amounted to anything and everything was essentially a tribute to great stuff. It was very easy to turn any episode and laugh. This is just a silly comedy about a silly community college. The most serious stuff that happened was the paintball episodes.\n\nJump to 2014 the russo brothers are called to make the sequel to captain america. They directed half of the first season episodes from community so they had a work relationship with chris mckenna, writer of classic episodes including Remedial Chaos Theory. They call him to make the script funnier. Back then CA First Avenger was seen as the dull hero but Winter Soldier changed everything. From that moment on they were in charge of the tone of the movies as much as Kevin Feige is for the story at large.\n\nNow you have the funny quips and team dynamic of community in the avengers and the intertextuality of the humor now serves a new purpose. They tie the rest of the IP together while lifting the aesthetic of other classic movies without naming them. Some MCU movies are genre movies but with superheroes. Look at who is developing disney+ mcu series, it's people that worked under Harmon. I find Harmon's work funny but it's tiring when everything is like that.",

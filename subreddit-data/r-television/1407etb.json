Philip Glenister and John Simm would have been on board even. \n\nI was on the fence with the idea, because let's be honest, they could only make it worse. However, seeing Sam and Gene work together again did intrigue me. But when nothing happened for almost three years, I knew it wouldn't come together.\n\nI do feel a bit disppointed, now, however. David Tennant gets another shot at the Doctor, so it would have been nice to see John Simm and Philip Glenister to also get another shot at portraying Sam Tyler and Gene Hunt.",

The new trailer shows that they are approaching a very much more unhinged version with him literally eating ice-cream on a corpse whilst talking to it, and needless to say since it is life-acting, with the first film being on an extremely limited budget, they portrayed the crazy just at the right levels to get us hooked. The moment he closes in on the pizza delivery guy at the beginning and then kisses his cheek, right after a violent outburst, are the hints of some issues. In the immortal words of Robert Downey Jr: \"Never go full retard\".  ",

As /u/rufio_vega pointed out [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1uiqaf/deadpools_inner_voices/cej84kz/) :  \n&gt;The yellow box has always served as the standard \"internal monologue\" for Deadpool while also serving as a foil for him to play off of when the story allowed for fourth-wall breaking.\n&gt;Way injected a second (white) box into the mix with no explanation, which served as Wade's more crazed inner voice. However, in the newest volume of Deadpool, the writing team has finally provided an absolutely perfect explanation for this third, seemingly loony voice: it was the villain Madcap inside Wade's head after the two accidentally fused together as they regenerated from an incident that left their charred remains mixed together. The absence of the third voice in the latest run is due to Madcap finally being separated from Wade during the brief period between the two volumes.  \n  \nIMO it was fun at first but quickly turned into just sillier, more basic meme-pool humor which, even if it actually turned DP into the uber popular character he is today, took away most of the characters complexity and nuance for a good while.  \nSo yeah, for my part, I was super happy that didnt show up in the movie (tho i liked it in the game)  \n(sorry for the bitchy rant btw, I just loved the original and kelly run)",

That is still *a lot* of important work. And I'm not sure why a project would want to tie Donald Glover's name to a project because, while he's respected, he just doesn't have superstar marketing power.",

I've always loved how Nolan portrays the character like the loud drunk asshole at the party who invades your personal space to yell shitty jokes in your ear. He's so genuinely unpredictable and insane sounding.\n\nHe also has a lot of range in his delivery. He can go from angerly barking in an extremely intimidating way, to squealing like a little girl. Ryan Reynolds just kinda uses the same, \"ironically feminine\" voice for most of his lines. It works, but it's not as unpredictable as I'd like with Deadpool.   ",

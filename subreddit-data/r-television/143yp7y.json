There are many lol (to me) jokes that are funnily because of how very closely they mirror reality, etc. now as someone mentioned there are some annoying things like dream sequences which i don\u2019t care for but that\u2019s just a matter of opinion on storytelling.

As good as the chemistry between the protagonists may be, the writing is just not good enough to stand up against the rather stupid and objectionable premise. I kept waiting for some twist that never comes. It plays too loose with grisly subject matter and gives you no real reason to root for anyone. I gotta give it like a 3/10, maybe 4/10 because it admittedly does follow a coherent story structure and makes proficient use of  formulaic elements to drive suspense and keep you clicking \"Next Episode\".",

The brief moments of the last episode that I saw made it clear that he is actually a real killer and the big twist I was waiting for was not coming. Unless it was somewhere at the VERY end of the last episode, they're playing it totally straight. But I saw a dead girl and a Zoom call between a bunch of serial killers and the main plumber guy, so I gathered that they just went full throttle into \"silly murderers.\"!&lt; \n\n  \nI just don't know why anyone is supposed to care about the main characters. Protagonists' actions usually need to be relatable or justifiable in some small way in order for people to want them to succeed. I don't recognize these two people or the world they live in, and if I suspend disbelief and accept that two people would behave this way then I still wind up wanting them to fail.\n\n  \nEdit: I guess I could sum up the whole objection by saying that it's just \\*not funny.\\* Two people colluding with a serial killer to profit off a podcast isn't cute or funny or silly, it's actually horrifying. Maybe some creators can get over the sheer disgust of the whole situation and still find the funny and the likability in that scenario, but these creators didn't.",

Here's my take away without any spoilers:\n\n1. There are graphic &amp; violent scenes in right off the bat.\n\n2. After the 1st episode, the graphic scenes are kind of spread out over the 8 episode series of Season 1\n\n3.  Nancy from Staranger Things is in this show.\n\n4. To me, it couldn't decide if it was a comedy, drama, thriller, or horror genre.\n\n5.  With that said, the funny music playing in the background while someone is being murdered is just weird. \n\n6.  I've liked Kaley Cuoco since her days on 8 Simple Rules...with John Ritter. I read somewhere that he was so impressed with her as a teenager, he set up a meeting between her and his managers &amp; agent and encouraged her to start her own production company.

Those sorts of scenes are such lazy tropes from writers, it seems,  who just want to mix up the show.\n\nThis looks similar, in the sense the only ray of light is Cucoa lifting the production with her performance, and flailing her arms around, while the middling story meanders and then veers off into bizarre territories.",

    "postText": "http://imgur.com/stIQ1kx\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/07/04/politics/kfile-reddit-user-trump-tweet/index.html\n\nQuote:\n\n\"After posting his apology, \"HanA**holeSolo\" called CNN's KFile and confirmed his identity. In the interview, \"HanA**holeSolo\" sounded nervous about his identity being revealed and asked to not be named out of fear for his personal safety and for the public embarrassment it would bring to him and his family.\n\nCNN is not publishing \"HanA**holeSolo's\" name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.\n\nCNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.\"\n\n\nHappy 4th of July, America.\n ",

Just wanted to pop in to say this: if you want CNN to stop doing this, one of the ways you can get them to is to contact their advertisers and tell them why you're not going to watch CNN, or use any of the products or services advertised on CNN.\nIt works. Trust me on this. CNN can potentially lose millions of dollars if you do this right. You can find their advertisers' e-mails and send (polite) letters explaining your future purchasing decisions, write them snail-mail, or potentially even call them. With enough e-mails, phone calls, and correspondence, CNN's advertisers WILL pull from them. If you're lucky, you might even be able to bankrupt CNN like this.\nThis cannot stand. CNN went after a private citizen and if this is allowed, then any news organization will be given free reign to terrorize anyone they like. This could potentially lead to a world where news organizations cherrypick people's family members out on Facebook, and demand a public apology-- coerced through the threat of doxing. And I'm simply not gonna stay silent when something that fucking terrible is on the cusp of happening.\n",

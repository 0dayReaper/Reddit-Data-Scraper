There's Willy Lowman and there's Hank Kingsley. So tragic.\n\nHank in the Little Bow Peep dress asking if everyone was laughing with him or at him and getting the answer he feared.\n\nAlso, the irony of how Howard Stern took Hank's \" Hey Now \" saying into his radio show and made it a thing but Jeffrey Tambor couldn't even get on the show himself when he asked. Very Hank like.\n\nRIP Garry Shandling.\n\nRIP Rip Torn.",

Currently in S8, just watched S7 (where this scene occurs) like 3 days ago....\nAnd I had no ideia that most of this shit was improvised! \n\nThanks a lot mate!! Your comment will make me appreciate the next seasons A LOT more!",

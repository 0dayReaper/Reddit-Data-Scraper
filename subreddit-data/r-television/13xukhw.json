    "postText": "It's not terrible or anything.. just has that usual \"prime time television\" feeling to me. Like NCIS or something. Not sure how to explain. \n\nStarted it because someone highly recommended it, but I'm not digging it much so far. So I'm curious what y'all think of the show. Does it basically keep that same feeling throughout the series? If you even know what I'm feeling I'm talking about hahaha. \n\nAgain.. not saying it's bad. But I can almost never get into those normal television shows from channels like NBC or something. Hannibal might be the only one I actually really enjoyed throughout.\n\nBut bc of the recommendation, and the show sounding interesting, figured I'd give it a shot. But I'm getting that same feeling I get from other shows on similar channels.",

You've just got too much random stuff crammed all under the umbrella of \"Fringe science\" that doesn't connect in more than a perfunctory way.\n\nThe emphasis on the procedural elements also causes character development to be crammed in where it can fit rather than in an organic manner.\n\nIn contrast, Season 5 is clearly long form storytelling from start to end. While it's somewhat structured around the individual steps of \"the plan\", the episodes are not self-contained with a few hints of a larger story but a natural telling of that larger story.\n\nI can definitely see why the experience of those watching weekly is different from those binge-watching. Even knowing what is coming, binge-watching Fringe feels a bit like binge-watching Law &amp; Order. It's just not how the show was intended to be experienced. In contrast, binge-watching Season 5 feels natural (although, obviously, you'll be a bit confused if you don't know all the backstory leading up to that point).",

Prestige TV with 8-10 highly serialized episodes was kind of in its infancy at that period. \n\n99% of Fringe episodes will have some sort of monster-of-the-week case that gets resolved during the episode, with exceptions for finales and an occasional episode here or there. If that\u2019s a total deal breaker for you, then maybe it won\u2019t get better for you. \n\nWhat makes Fringe unique though is most episodes tie into the broader overarching arc of the series, which you haven\u2019t even gotten to yet. And the episodes that don\u2019t still tie back to the broader arc thematically, usually paralleling the emotional states of the characters or serving as metaphors to what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s rare for an episode to be entirely irrelevant in some way. It\u2019s for this reason that I think you should keep going. There IS a phenomenal overarching story to the series, but you\u2019ll just have to deal with what you consider filler too since the show is a product of its time. \n\nWatch all of Season 1 and then decide. \n\n**Important Disclaimer** Depending on how you\u2019re watching the show, there might be a 21st episode in Season 1. That is an unaired episode from Season 1 and NOT the finale. The finale is entitled \u201cThere\u2019s More Than One of Everything\u201d. If you didn\u2019t know this you\u2019d be massively confused if you watched \u201cUnearthed\u201d.",

But almost every show I've seen from these prime time television shows from channels like NBC, etc,  all have the same type of feeling for me. Even if they're not episodic, or monster of the week style. It's like they're lower quality and cheesy. But idk if that's the exact way to describe it. \n\nGenerally try not to say stuff like that, bc there's a lot of fans for these type of shows. And calling them names like that kinda sounds pretentious. But that's just the feeling I get every time I try to watch one. Even if some are better than others. \n\nBut I can't really think of one that's on the same level as top shows from HBO, or even channels like FX has some great ones. And I don't mean \"it needs to be TVMA!\". \n\nBut I understand these shows are made under different circumstances. So it's not really a fair comparison. But 99% of the ones I've seen are not for me. But I'll still check one out every so often. \n\nBut yeah like I was saying, Fringe def doesn't seem like a bad show that I'm completely turned off by. Compared to something like NCIS that I could never in a million years get into lol. But I have enjoyed a couple. Hannibal was great, and I enjoyed a lot of Lost. Lost kinda suffered from what I was talking about above in some parts though. And the overall show went off of the rails towards the end. But still enjoyed the show overall.",

They\u2019re shows from a different era. They were cranking out 20+ episodes a year. You can\u2019t compare shows like this to Succession or Game of Thrones. They had infinitely smaller budgets and were made under entirely different scenarios. \n\nIt\u2019s totally fine to not like them and it\u2019s not pretentious. But don\u2019t write them off either. Look at them as products of their time and appreciate what they\u2019re trying to do. Don\u2019t compare them to modern television because they aren\u2019t modern television.",

Takes everything back to his not sterile lab.\n\n\n5) Walter investigates, acts weird, Olivia and Pacey go out talking to people to find the source of face melting or whatever fucking thing.\n\n\n6) They find another body and the stakes just got higher. Walter gets sad because he remembers his own research into melting faces.\n\n\n7) Walter might wander off and Asteroid needs to find him.  Olivia gets into a tight corner in a house by herself, and finds the guy with the power to melt faces.\n\n\n8) Pacey almost dies and Olivia shoots face melter.\n\n\n9) Denounement with some link to 'the pattern'.\n\n\nREPEAT.",

DO YOU WANT THAT SWEET SWEET NERD CRED??? If so, keep watching, cuz if you go to Comic-Con and admit you quit on Fringe I guarantee you'll get that harsh cold shoulder, like if you said Firefly was overrated.\n\nBut for real, it's a great show, the plotting is amazing, the science is cool and weird, and the characters are legendary. If you're not already in love with Walter maybe it ain't the show for you. But I don't see that as a real possibility considering he's one of the greatest and best acted characters in the history of television.\n\n\nP.S. If you like Leonard Nimoy you should stick around.",

This is so new viewers can tune in and not need to have seen previous episodes to understand what's going on.  This is very typical for network TV shows that are just starting out.\n\nFringe undergoes a retooling in its first mid-season and then starts to build the arc that will be told for the rest of the series.\n\nI think people who watch a lot of prestige/serialized shows that are 8-10 episodes long forget that networks force shows to be episodic and not have much happen early on in their runs so the show can build a viewership when the episode count is going to be 20+ episodes. As opposed to just coming right out of the gate with the main mystery, the hook and a cliffhanger from the start.",

I pushed through season 1 due to the advice that it would be worth it and that everything builds to a plan. I got to the end of S4 and will say that my subjective experience was that the show failed to get much better, remains largely procedural, and some of the longer-term elements which it does set up didn't land for me at all. For a show with a similar dynamic of starting off procedural but then introducing broader themes, I'd recommend Person of Interest, which I found much more compelling. And if you are a massive Fringe fan then this isn't to disagree with you, it's just to give the case against.",

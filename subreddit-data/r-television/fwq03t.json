The guy is a piece of shit. Hell, all you need to know is that he paid his workers $20/day to risk their lives working with deadly animals, and fed them expired meat. And that's just scratching the surface.\n\nThere's a podcast by Wondery called Joe Exotic that tells his story and has some details that the documentary didn't. Worth listening to. One big thing that doc left out was that that Joe didn't sing or write any of those country songs. He hired some musicians to record the songs and didn't give them credit. I don't really know how anyone believes that's him singing, just listen to high pitched, nasally voice. It sounds nothing like the voice in the songs.",

They focus on the spectacle and party of Wall Street but  they forget to take the audience to the dining room of a man who has just bet his whole life on a life and is reaping nothing for it. The entire thing is a scam, but you really never see the actual impact of the scam, none of the victims really get shown. As a result, people tend to think of Belfort as this comedic character, and his biggest character flaw seems to be his drug use and not, y'know, willfully and openly scamming people into participating into a literal shell game where he makes all the money.",

I don't know if relieved is the right word. Especially with the balls comment, totally gross and uncouth. I've never done meth so I might be totally off-base but I'm hoping it took some of the edge off of the legitimate absurdity and awfulness. It also seems like she cleaned up after the whole thing. From her interview, I'm wondering if her final wake up call might have been getting invited to the next wedding two months later and never being called again. I would have left the moment there were only 4 people, and certainly not stayed for a fucking picture. Travis and his mom's experiences in this story broke my damn heart.",

Clearly not a main \u201ccharacter\u201d or \u201cstar\u201d or person, but he seemed to be one of the only people who was sober and involved and aware enough to grasp everything that was happening.\n\nEdit because I\u2019m too lazy to respond to each individual reply (because they\u2019re more or less the same):\n\nI\u2019m not saying he was a super normal person or that I agree with libertarian ideas (which he mentioned a lot, which is weird) but I\u2019m just saying between him, Jeff, Joe and all of his partners (past, dead, and current) he was the best bet of a coherent, honest story. I don\u2019t know if there were more reliable and trustworthy narrators involved with everything. I also didn\u2019t pick up that it\u2019s very likely he also used meth. He\u2019s not perfect, but as far as the options go, I trust his stories the most compared to anyone else in that part of the story. Joe\u2019s employees were my favorite to hear from, but they weren\u2019t as involved with everything that happened with Jeff and all that so they weren\u2019t as informed.\n\nNot supposed to be a grouchy defense! Just clarifying what I was meaning when I initially wrote this comment and acknowledging a lot of really good comments replied to me- thank you!!",

IMO he deserved everything he got and his only redeeming value was that he was going to spill the beans on the other assorted shitheads he worked with.\n\n\nBut the podcast really filled in HOW he got so fucked up. It doesn't excuse what he's done, but now I feel more sorry than anything. Dude just wanted to save cats and bang dudes, and instead all he got was 20 solid years of trauma. He's a case study on traumatic formation",

All the terrible things he did shouldn\u2019t deprive him of receiving sympathy and compassion as a human being. That doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s a good person or should be let out of prison or EVER own animals again, but he\u2019s still human. There seems to be a lot of very painful circumstances that (in part) led him to become the \u201cTiger King\u201d. It\u2019s fun to laugh at the worst of humanity, but it\u2019s also a mirror of how we might not be so far away from it in different circumstances.",

Sadly thats a fact of life for dogs and cats so im willing to that one transgression slide.\n\nDoc had tigers looking like they needed a visit with Dr Now, and i 1000% believe he euthanized baby tigers once they were too big to avoid expense of raising them as adult.

Including the filmmakers.\n\nFun as hell to watch, though.\n\nEdit: I watched episode 3 and no longer believe she murdered her husband.",

The volunteers at BCR either live near BCR or live on provided housing (though that is interns). The interns are apparently given a food stipend. Volunteers only have to work 4 hours a week if they want to. They talk about how they wear colored shirts but that is something a ton of charities do. Hell, fucking comic-cons have volunteers and workers with different colored shirts. It makes it easy to identify people and their roles.\n\nI can guarantee no one at BCR is digging thru expired Walmart meat to take some home. And they are not getting their arms ripped off because they are poorly trained and working hands on with big cats.",

Travis was being mourned and he used that opportunity to make it about himself. Travis inadvertently shot himself in the head while confiding how trapped and imprisoned he felt being with Joe. Immediately after that, Joe made plans to use Travis's mother and subsequently moved on except for using his last name and tragic story while running as governor.\n\nI mean, do people really think Joe Exotic gave a shit about whether Carole Baskin killed her husband? It was an intriguing story that he could tell over and over again to be the center of attention whenever he wanted. Half the time, he just used it as a way to divert any sort of accountability. Everyone around him he could take advantage of was sucked of all their resources until they dried up.",

He said he had footage of him shooting tigers, and even a horse some woman had dropped off to him to look after. He said after she thanked him and drove off, he shot it and fed it to the tigers.",

The documentary isn\u2019t bad, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it\u2019s clear that a lot of people came away with the impression that Joe Exotic was a harmless eccentric who was pushed over the edge by the murderess Carol Baskin. \n\nThat\u2019s definitely what Joe wants people to think and he made that argument pretty vehemently when he was interviewed a year ago but people should be more cautious about accepting his self serving rationalizatiom at face value. The guy is *at best* (!) a ruthless con man who profiteers off of animal exploitation. He might be funny and amusing but he isn\u2019t a good person.",

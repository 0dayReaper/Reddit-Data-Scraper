Some people still read magazines so they can put ads in US, People etc. They can put pictures on the show on buses, subway trains, kiosks etc. The actors can do interviews on Today, GMA, Live with Kelly etc. Also even on cable shows they can show previews for other shows like when I watch some Showtime or HBO/Max shows they have ads for other shows before the show begins. The problem is network executives don't seem to bother with marketing and promoting most shows anymore and then the shows get cancelled because people don't know they exist.",

On HBO before I watch some shows there are previews for TLOU or HOTD but not Perry Mason or other shows. I don't have ads blocked on social media yet rarely see ads for shows other than Hulu and never see any on Twitter even before it was sold to Musk. Most people either have cable or subscribe to streaming services so they get emails about their bill every month. They could put ads for those shows in emails. They could send them with paper bills if people have those mailed to them. \n\nAlso we're not talking about small locally owned networks. HBO just gave Sam Levinson almost $100M for The Idol but spent nothing promoting Perry Mason or most other shows except for TLOU and HOTD.",

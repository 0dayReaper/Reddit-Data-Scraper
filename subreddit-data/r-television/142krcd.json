I don't remember much from the show though, I think I just watched an episode or two.\n\nThe KC accents and weirdly broken English (weird bc it was very inconsistent in a way that didn't feel real) always felt like caricature in a way that was punching down.\n\nWait so neither of the KC actors who play the parents speak Korean? lol that makes sense. I always thought it was so weird that they never spoke in Korean to each other or their kids, but I thought that was more bc the showrunners didn't want to have subtitles. And ofc Randall Park of FOTB is Korean, so I'm guessing he didn't know any Mandarin for FOTB.\n\nI can think of some positive/well-written examples of comedies about second generation immigrants and their parents....Ramy and Jane the Virgin. Neither is a sitcom however. I wonder if they had bigger budgets. I never got into Nora from Queens.",

It's just a good, character-driven family sitcom that's centered around the owners of a corner store and their neighborhood.\n\nThere are some Asian-American dynamics in play, and references to their culture but it's not a huge part of the show and they could kinda be immigrants from anywhere. The clash of immigrant parents and their culture and the kids who grow up culturally bilingual is relatable to many Canadians and Americans.",

She had a crazy upbringing and early life.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr)\n\n\n&gt;Barr was born in Salt Lake City, to a working-class Jewish family. She is the oldest of four children born to Helen (n\u00e9e Davis), a bookkeeper and cashier, and Jerome Hershel \"Jerry\" Barr, who[6] worked as a salesman.[7] Her father's family were Jewish emigrants from Russia, and her maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria-Hungary and Lithuania.[6] Her paternal grandfather changed his surname from \"Borisofsky\" to \"Barr\" upon entering the United States.[7]\n\n&gt;Her Jewish upbringing was influenced by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother.[7] Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[7] Barr has stated, \"Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons.\"[8]\n\n&gt;When Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy on the left side of her face. Barr said, \"[so] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured\". Years later Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came \"exactly at the right time\".[7]\n\n&gt;At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and even was elected president of a Mormon youth group.[7]\n\n&gt;At 16, Barr was hit by a car; the incident left her with a traumatic brain injury.[7] Her behavior changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at Utah State Hospital.[9] While institutionalized she had a baby, which she placed through adoption.[10]\n\n&gt;In 1970, when Barr was 18 years old, she moved out by informing her parents she was going to visit a friend in Colorado for two weeks, but never returned.[9]\n\nEdit: Formatting",

The other week Bill Maher did a whole 5 minute closer on his HBO show about Rosanne Barr and how they had been friends forever and that she's a total socialist and he doesn't get why she's like this now. He just kept saying wtf, a few years ago you were as left as it gets etc.\n\nMaybe there is something going on aside from just racism. I always thought she was a progressive until someone brought her up a few months ago. ",

Sure, more money is always great, but I doubt she's strapped for cash with syndication. \n\nNow the rest of the crew who it might have been a good gig this hurts. I don't know how much of the crew is from the original tapings or not.\n\nEdit: I've been made aware that lots of networks have now pulled syndication as well. Even Hulu pulled episodes. This really hurts the entire cast and crew from decades ago who received royalties. She fucked so many people, it's sad. ",

He realizes, however, that he is completely unable to write her story for her and so, in substitute, the family (i.e., ensemble cast) commits to living their lives out loud, the way Roseanne always did.\n\nRun title: ***~~Dearest Roseanne~~ The Conners***\n\nEdit: /u/ksavage68 re-titled the show - fantastic idea.\n",

After a season or two, it was eventually renamed ''[The Hogan Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hogan_Family)''. I could see something similar working with the cast of Roseanne.

                    "comment": "They should rework the show with John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf as the focus of the series. Roseanne Barr is expendable. The show has a solid cast without her. They can write her out with a car crash, or maybe have her be a victim of a shooting at a grocery store to be topical. \n\nEdit: A user below found the episode where this basically happened already, in season 2 of the series, way back in 1990. Roseanne's sister Jackie acts as surrogate mom while Roseanne is gone for three days. https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/8n13k3/roseanne_cancelled_abc_scraps_season_11_after/dzs6qat/\n\nThanks, user who I can't name or the automod will delete my comment!",

Except it wasn't funny and that was a horrible decision in what at least used to be considered a \"safe space\" (that was one of the first times a cell phone video caught something like that in the act). Not excusing it, not saying he shouldn't have done it, but I agree with you, this is way worse. His bit was basically supposed to be about the *power of the N-word* but it was really sloppy and offensive. But it was clearly a one-time thing, even after that a lot of black comedians and such came out in defense of him.\n\nAlso, it's not like this is the first time Roseanne Barr has said shit like this either, she has been saying crazy, ignorant and even racist shit on Twitter before - this was just SO offensive and SO blatant that it was a slap in the face to everybody who didn't see how she was already, and there was no plausible deniability (\"oh, she *really* meant X Y Z\".) And she thought that everybody would agree with her (and frankly, a large part of her viewerbase probably does, the alt-right people they intended to appeal to with the show).",

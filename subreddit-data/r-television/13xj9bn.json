    "postText": "Nick (Dan Hadeya) moves to Vegas and tries to start some kind of repair business and tries to get back together with his second wife. \n\nOnly one season. Crazy that I literally never heard of it, like at all. I guess they all can't be a Frasier. \n\n&gt;After the series was canceled, all four Tortelli characters returned to Cheers, where it was revealed that Nick's TV repair business in Las Vegas went under, but also that Nick and Loretta were still together (albeit somewhat shakily) and were still living in Las Vegas.",

Ken said that he and David worked with the Charles brothers to hammer out a story for the episode and it took two days. It was exhausting, and he asked Glenn Charles what episode it was. Charles said that it was only number four. They agreed that if it's that tough to come up with stories so early, there's something wrong with the premise.  Nick and Loretta were fun side characters but couldn't carry a series.",

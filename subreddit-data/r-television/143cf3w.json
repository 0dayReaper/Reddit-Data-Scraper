People forget that MSNBC was to the right after 9/11. Jerry Nachman was best known for editing the NY Post, which seems to me to be pretty right wing. The main difference between that and Fox is caving in to anti-intelligence hysteria.\n\nThere's a slight difference between the typical Murdoch press of the past fifty years and Fox News (and the networks it's bleeding viewers to).",

And HBO Max even had problems! But somehow this managed to have worse playback issues, a slower and clunkier search, menus that have noticeably shit image quality, and picture quality that definitely was not 100% for a chunk of time and literally as soon as the credits rolled just immediately shit itself. And they took away the hubs and front screen is a garbage mess.\n\nBetween this and the price rises I honestly am thinking I might just cancel at the end of the month and go back to pirating anything I want to watch that's on there.",

But on a factual level, he rolled into LSSC, made big promises to Colbert and the staff in exchange for complete control, and from their perspective at least, he delivered for them.",

It's not an easy listening morning show, you can't water down the news content enough to please the partisans without driving away the existing audience. Plus the Fox audience wants outright conspiracies and race baiting and so on. You don't win them over with a weak version of the real news.",

It seems that Colbert was good about delegating and trusting Licht, but it's still Stephen's show.\n\nLicht tried to take over and dictate the editorial voice, and that seems to be where a lot of his missteps were. On top of that, there wasn't an accessible boss above Licht if people had concerns, so things like moving his office and becoming less accessible were a bigger deal.",

No argument there. \n\n**BUT** I\u2019m old enough to remember the \u201cmonoculture\u201d of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s and things did not feel as fractured then. Definitely not advocating for a return to the \u201cgood old days\u201d. But, as audiences shrink and fragment- and the voices required to get ears and eyes get more radicalized and louder- I often wonder if there is a leveling out effect when you have to speak to a wider audience. We see it often in big tentpole movies that are made for wide audiences. It sands the edges off to be sure.  But more people engage with it as a whole vs crawling in the rabbit hole of their choosing. \n\nSo maybe that\u2019s the danger. Smaller audiences with more potential for radicalization vs larger with less nuance to incite/anger, but also a reduction in relevant and necessary voices.  \n\nI probably just talked myself out of my own point but it\u2019s something I wonder about.",

That's different from the days of \"monoculture\" that you talk about.  We can debate whether or not the fracturing of media and entertainment is a good thing or not but I think it's a certainty that 24 hour news channels are NOT a net positive for society and we would be better off without them.",

I do, however, believe that the cable channels like CNN, FoxNews, MSNBC, etc will just move to another platform; namely streaming as IPTV.\n\n24 hour news isn't a bad thing and is helpful but when it started it was 3 hours of news that was repeated 8 times a day.  Then it turned into sensationalist bullshit where they have a story of the day/week and just beat it into the ground.  They didn't cover news anymore as much as they covered (and manufactured) outrage to drive in viewers.  They didn't care about the news, they cared about viewership and money.\n\nTHIS is the part that is bad.  Politicians needed 24 hour news networks as much as 24 hour news networks needed politicians.  Politicians learned they can just make it an Us vs. Them climate and polarize their followers.  Then they don't have to worry about those and focus just on the middle ground voters.  Jeff Jackson, NC Representative, talked about how behind closed doors and no cameras, the people who screamed the loudest on TV, were calm and fine because there was no one to play to.",

Licht definitely came in breaking everything to make a mark which is his fault but not everything is his fault",

If you make a hard right wing turn, those viewers are going to abandon you because they are old moderate democrats who are pretty set in their ways. They aren't going to be \"convinced\" or anything. They are going to move to a different channel (Probanly something in the MSNBC realm, which is slightly more left but still more or less in line with those viewers opinions). \n\nThe FOX audience was never going to come over. They've been primed to hate CNN for over a decade now. It would take a loooooong period of CNN being hard right for that to break down at all, and CNNs shareholders were never going to give that long of a leash. \n\nYet another case of an exec thinking he can control the audience and learning that audiences already have their own opinions.\n\nWhile CNN is trash in its own unique way, there is no halfway point between \"The Truth\" and \"This is what my conservative uncle with 38 guns wants to be true\" and audiences understand that to varying degrees. Fox has cornered the market on Conservatives. There really isn't a demand for \"moderate republican\" content because the party has gone so thoroughly off the deep end. The only way to get that market share is to do what Newsmax and OAN did and go *even crazier*",

CNN during Trumps term was basically a giant, communal existential crisis happening at the network put on 24 hr display.",

It's ridiculous.  Most of the time there's no real news so they just talk about polling and what Trump tweeted that day, while other stories barely get any time except for when they are \"hot\" (mass shootings, police shootings, natural disaster, etc).\n\nI understand that in the internet age where you can get news on demand online there is less need to have the old \"Headline News\" style of reporting where they essentially did back-to-back-to-back 30 minute news broadcasts for most of the day.  Just like how there was little room for a channel like MTV showing music videos all day long when you had Youtube available to play any video you wanted on demand.  I get it.  But a lot of people are passive about getting news and not actively seeking news stories, and so actually broadcasting more about other important stories will help disseminate the info and inform.",

If it was a brand new show I\u2019d understand but this has become a recent tradition of theirs.\n\nPlus the centering of their agenda, which I appreciate may be a decision above him, was particularly odd given his Colbert background.

Show was great and had a fantastic cast, but it didn't really seem like it got much of a push from HBO, and the three years between seasons certainly didn't help.  I had completely forgotten about it until I saw a trailer shortly before the new season.",

The period dramas put out by HBO have a production quality that a lot *films* don't even touch. Definitely the only place on tv to see different eras really come to life.

I can easily imagine a better version of it. \n\nPerry is self-righteous and a bit incompetent for most of the show and only gets something done by the end. There only so much you can handle watching broken people bumbling through a mystery while getting fucked by society at every turn without getting cool moments where they fight back or show they know what they are doing.\n\nLook at a show like Mad Men, it was serious and complicated, but still funny and a lot of times exhilarating. And this show has detective work, murder mystery, courtroom drama... it shouldn't be hard to make it more exciting. \n\nI think sometimes the money spent on this show to make it look as good as it does is wasted on plain scenes with flat dialogue, where nothing really pops.",

They made the protagonist very flawed and brittle and seemed to tailor it more to modern tastes than staying true to the source material. \n\nIMO, a show like 'Bosch' does a better job at getting through the noir aesthetic than Mason ever did. My two cents.",

Do you scroll through all current shows for each network to see what shows are on it? It's like for Netflix if they don't have a preview of a show when I log on sometimes I don't even know about shows unless they're in the top 10 list that week since that is always on the front page.",

    "postText": "I passed on this series in first-run but was one of those things where on a Sunday night I decided to see what it was all about.\n\nFirst of all, that moment where it's 2020 that the epidemic takes place and a viewer in 2023 goes, \"Whoa.\" Other than that, I right off the bat enjoyed the \"empty\" America vibe that the show creates. It's very well-done. Will Forte does a good job portraying a dude who has lost his marbles after realizing he's all alone. Kristen Schaal is terrific as someone who is just as nuts but in a different way. The commentary about relationships is on-point even though presented in a surreal way.\n\nI just got to the cliffhanger where January Jones shows up so I'm looking forward to binging the rest of the series. Not sure why I never gave this a shot when it was on but it's the kind of odd sort of sitcom that I've always enjoyed. Like I said, surreal like Gilligan's Island or Green Acres.",

Continuity will change, characters will develop and change out of development at a drop of a hat, important plotlines will come and go. Last Man is the epitome of \"OK, so this is what we wanna do this week\".  \nThere are SOME similarities we future people can't ascribe to the show post COVID, not a ton.  \nEnjoy the ride, it's a good one.",

TV writers never used to get to plan out huge stories because they were still writing episodes while a season was airing.  Even movie directors basically only had their one movie to tell a story.  Now there's this whole middle ground where you can tell your story in whatever way is most appropriate.\n\nOn top of that, censorship has nearly vanished and companies like Netflix and Amazon are dumping huge amounts of money into these artists and giving them just an insane amount of freedom.  As if that's not enough, technology has gotten so good and cheap that now basically whatever an artist can visualize can be created.  It's never been like this before. It's really a huge revolution in visual storytelling.\n\nAnd when these big changes happen, it's the beginning few years that people later on end up glorifying and being nostalgic about because that's where all the new experimentation and freedom happens.  \n\nSeriously, it's happening right now.\n\n",

It's a really interesting remix they've done - it's like they wrote almost 1:40 of Thriller-like atmospheric music and gradually slide into the real song.  \n\nAt 0:58, the atmospherics that start have the same notes &amp; chords as the organ part from Thriller, but they're on new instruments.  Similarly, at 1:10 - 1:20, that frenetic mid-range part and the low rumbling bass part are the synth and bass parts from the original, but they're being done on 2017 instruments.  \n\nThe Vincent Price laugh at 1:20 is obviously original... but when he starts his \"Darkness falls\" monologue, the backing *still* isn't the real thing.  It's synced up like the real song, though.  At 1:36, right after the first MJ vocals, you hear a pipe organ, and that definitely *is* from the original -- this is where the mix starts to become the real song.  \n\nBy 1:53 it's *mostly* the original, but there are a few things that have still been added to punch up the mix!  At 2:09 a lot of the modern parts have dropped out and it's like 90% the original... but they've still chopped a bunch of the 1980s synthesized werewolves &amp; screams out, and trimmed it down (or built it from parts).

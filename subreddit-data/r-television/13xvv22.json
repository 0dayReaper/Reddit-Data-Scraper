There\u2019s a couple of shows like Andor and The Boys which are excellent but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re quite at that level. What do you think?",

HBO has a good chance of making a show like that because of once-a-week episodes that cultivate discussions and connection to a show (Stranger Things gets released, I watch it and then *completely* forget about it until the next season 15 years later), a lot of their content is great and not disposable crap like most of the Netflix stuff, and HBO has a reputation. Apple TV is also good, but it is not available in every country, Hulu also. A lot of streaming services are out there, and a lot of TV shows are available, but GOT's success is going to be hard to replicate (yes, the last season is not good, but it was the most watched s*** in the world).",

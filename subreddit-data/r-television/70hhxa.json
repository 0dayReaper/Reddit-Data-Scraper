They did torture him for 2 days tho. Happy he's alive and it all worked out , but could have gone much worse much faster. Scary place. \n\nOh and his job fired him after that because he wanted time off after the incident. ",

Easily the worst times were when they had control down there. Regularly kidnapped people and took everything from them after beating the shit out of them, shot people dead in the streets, rape, extortion, and for the first time in my life everyone down there was terrified to go outside. It was so sad to see the square where all the kids and teenagers would gather to flirt with the girls and talk be empty at night. \n\nAfter the Gulf cartel came in  and kicked them out they hung banners in Tabasco, the bigger town in the area that everyone goes to buy stuff,  saying that they were in charge now and that they weren't going to hurt the people like the Zetas did. This was around Xmas time so they went around the villages in vans handing out toys to all the kids. I still have the message that was attached to the toys. \n\nPoint being that the Gulf cartel was definitely not as bad as the Zetas. Still a shitty cartel and they still do a lot of shitty stuff but they aren't as unhinged and purposefully violent as the Zetas were. The Zetas are violent to terrorize and have fun, other cartels use violence as a way to get what they want done.  \n\nEDIT: As a other people have pointed out below the Zetas were part of the Gulf Cartel before and splintered off. I consider them differently because in our part of Mexico the Zetas have had a worse impact and have behaved differently than the original Gulf Cartel they separated from. ",

Of course they weren't called or known as the Zetas back then, they where just considered to  be part of the gulf cartel. Things were relatively calm back then. You never heard about kidnappings or extorsions, in fact Cardenas (leader of Gulf cartel) kept things in order and would make sure that regular people were not messed with. When Cardenas got caught it's when everything went to shit. There was a power struggle between Cardenas younger brother, Tony Tomerntas and the \"special forces guys\". That's when all the shootings started, at any time of day or night all around Matamoros.  Still the fights was just between them, regular people for the most part where not beign affected. Eventually Tony wins and the Zetas make their own cartel and all hell  breaks lose. Since the Zetas really didn't have any real connections in Colombia or the U.S. they resorted to get their money  from everyday people. That's when they started kidnapping, doctors, lawyers, business men and anyone who had any money. After 911, border security was increased and cartels where not able to make as much money as they used to so that caused conflict too and even they started kidnapping.",

The man that decided to start the federal police was suspected of working with the cartels and started the federal police so he could have control over it from the top and aid the Sinaloa cartel in gaining power through use of the federal police. There is a book called Narcoland by Anabel Hernandez, she's an investigative journalist who has looked into the cartels and this book has a very detailed look into the cartels and the government and the many people involved on both sides. The Mexican military is actually relatively uncorrupted though. Sad shit.  \n\nThe Gulf cartel actually prefers to have things be quiet. When people gather for parties and dances everyone is very cautious of starting fights or problems because it's guaranteed that they'll show up and snatch any motherfuckers starting problems. Me and my cousins were going to get into a huge brawl in my mom's town one year and my dad stopped everything and took us all home. ",

They themselves carry out certain crimes like auto theft. \n\nNot all of them, it seems, are on a cartel's pay roll though. There is still gun skirmishes between the federal police and the cartel inside major cities. So it's hard to tell who you're dealing with when you're dealing with police. This is at least the case in border cities in Coahuila (border with Texas). ",

It's like okay, whatever, it's a bloody skull with no eyes and very little flesh left. But then the skull opens his jaw up and down, twitching and randomly yelling. It feels like a shitty horror movie with bad effects but it's real... \n\nThen his bloody bony stubs move and twitch around reaching for something while progressively screaming, and making weird sounds. Shit made me cringe. And then he gets stabbed repeatedly in the neck and is still alive! What the absolute fuck, Mexico?     \n\n*Edit: more descriptive*\n\nThey stick a box cutter in his mouth too, trying to cut his tongue and he bites it and won't let go, lol. He put up a fight until the end. Then they get it out and keep sticking it back in trying to get his tongue. Because he's reaching with his bony stubs and he's twisting and moving a lot, they call someone to step on him. So, a random guy comes and steps on this dudes chest. Then they stick a machete? Some large black thing inside his mouth trying to shut him up. They take it out and keep stabbing him randomly and that's when I quit. \n\nI only saw half the video. Lord knows what happens the other fucking half but no way, I may be dead inside but even this was too much for me.  ",

FYI Mexican Catholic guilt is almost as strong as Irish Catholic guilt if not stronger. These people rape, pillage, and murder and then go to church with a clean conscience. These people give no literal fucks. Killing someone is about as normal to them as brushing their teeth, it's not different to them, it's just something they do and it does not seem to weigh in their conscience at all.",

While searching they found a mass grave of 40, but it wasn't the one they were looking for.  They accidentally found a separate mass grave!\n\nAnd that shit is going on closer to us than anything in the Middle East.  Hell, for some Americans that violence is closer than stuff going on in other parts of the continental U.S.\n\nI love Mexico.  It is a beautiful wonderful country.  But ISIS isn't shit compared to cartels.  Remember, the guys who join ISIS are disillusioned brain washed people who are pushed into their arms using religion and fear mongering.  People join cartels for money and fun.  ",

I think the cartels live by the 'Kiki Rule' which is a reference to a DEA agent named Kiki Camanera who was kidnapped, tortured and killed...  the DEA responded with special forces and an army of agents to take down the Colombian cartel (gang?) that did it.\n\nYeah...  don't kidnap or kill DEA agents or you feel the full brunt of the US military.  Then again, the conspiracy theorists say the CIA leaked Kiki because he was impacting some long term investigation.  They then used his death as further justification to go after the head honchos.",

            "comment": "Coming from Mexico, this doesn't surprise me in the least. I love my country but it's a cess pool of shit. People have lost their humanity over 20$. May they all burn in hell and die painful and lonely deaths, for they've destroyed countless lives of hardworking and honest people.\n\nEDIT: holy moly this has blown up! I figured I might as well clarify some things I see on the comments.\n\nI moved away from Mexico (tamaulipas) almost a decade ago. I had been kidnapped a couple times, my father many times more. I've lost farms that took me the majority of my life to work for, same with my father. He had to close down his business because of their violence, and so did I. Luckily I didn't lose family members as others have. I have several friends who got their families wiped out, or lost some members just cause of money. These people actually believe the world owes them a good life, and show up some where and just say it's now theirs. I grew tired of it and after months of courts, my family and I achieved citizenship in the great country of the USA. \n\nOf course, when I say I hope for bad things, it's to the narcos. Not everyone, there are many like me who were forced to make changes in their lives because of this violence. Many have lost family members, money, land, businesses, even their own lives to these animals (I won't call them humans cause they aren't in my eyes). \n\nAlso, of course this violence isn't everywhere in the country. Most tourist places are fine, it's the borders that can get very bad. Anyone who tries to tell you it isn't as bad as the media portays it, they're lying. They don't understand what it is to have to worry about a family member just dissappearing out of the face of this world for no reason, or to have someone just walk into your property and just say its theirs, or what it's like to be kidnapped. If you try to downplay this, you're an idiot and should be ashamed. It's not like other countries. Ever since I moved to the US I've never worried about losing my farms to some random person, or my family members dying cause a murderer decided they wanted their money. \n\nIll stay around if anyone has questions about my experiences and what I've lived in Mexico. Viva Mexico and the USA!! \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nEdit 2: Since a few people have asked, I will talk a little about my first kidnap. I was about 18 years old, right before going to college. I was driving back from work, and i was cornered by 3 black SUVs, and about 10 dudes with machine guns came out yelling for me to get out of the car. Long story short, a bag was placed over my head, and I was taken somewhere.\n\nIn that somewhere, you could hear screams: men, children, women, etc. You lose track of time there, with not knowing whats around you or its day time so it seems like an eternity. The kidnappers would walk around and toy with us by bopping our heads with the barrels of their guns, making fun of us for being scared and not being brave like them. \n\nIn this place, I met a little kid besides me, 12 at the time. They kept toying with him saying that the parents couldn't afford his ransom and that they would start sending body parts to their house. I tried comforting the child as much as I could but it's really hard given the situation. Low and behold after what seems years, they come in and start taunting the kid that its time for them to \"have fun with him.\" The kid starts screaming and crying, and hugs me. I was still frozen in shock, and I couldn't move a finger.\n\nThen when they started grabbing him, I just blurted out that I'd pay for him. To this day I don't know what part of me decided to say this, it literally just came out. My voice was very shakey. They started laughing at me, saying that I was trying to be a hero, etc etc. I just told them to add it on to whatever I had to pay. After much taunting, they let the boy go and they left.\n\nOnce again, I was trying to calm the kid down, saying it was going to be okay and over soon enough. To make the story shorter and because I'm tearing up typing this out, some argument ensued and they decided to make me watch as they killed this kid and video tape it to send it to the parents. Just cause what they had asked of them was too much. \n\nThe last thing I heard from them was that if I ever tried being a little hero again tha it'd bite me back ten times worse. \n\nI still have nightmares about that night and the little kid, and probably will for the rest of my life. This is why I understand why people don't want illegal immigration, but also why I can't fathom the option to send them back to that stuff. I feel like theres too much work to be done to correct all this shit. \n\nI hope none of you live what my family and I have lived through, unless you're one of them. If you are, I hope everything you do to others comes back to you 10 times worse.\n\nEdit 3: thank you for the gold! Also thanks to everyone who's PM'ed me kind words, and questions about my experiences and beliefs. \n\nI'll still be available if anyone has questions, I'll try to answer any doubts. Excuse me if I take a while though as I'm celebrating Mexico's independence day with my family.",

I don't know any of the specifics with Colombia or Mexico, but film projects are often able to save money by filming internationally.

Whenever a tv show or movie features a rundown apartment complex, or someplace that could be \"the hood\" we're the ones who drive out to those places on our own with our cameras. I've heard of multiple of horror stories of scouts being sent to bad neighborhoods. Sometimes there are even gang liaisons that coordinate  between the local gangs and the film crew. I heard that one of these liaisons was actually shot and killed right after a filming project finished. \n\nIt can be scary sometimes, fortunately I haven't had to scout too many of these areas, but it's not uncommon. Its a weird job we have. I've had days where I go knock door to door on mansions in Beverly Hills all day, being rejected over and over again. Most people with that kind of money have no interest in filming. I've had doors slammed in my face, security called... All I'm doing is literally knocking on doors, and offering people thousands of dollars to film at their house. ",

He was not killed in the state of Hidalgo.  This is important to note because Hidalgo is actually one of the safest states in Mexico, with a murder rate comparable to most states in the US.  There is also no US State Department advisory for travel to Hidalgo.\n\nWhile I appreciate authenticity in filmmaking, this isn't 20-30 year old history in Mexico like it is in Colombia.  It's ongoing.  \n\nThere are other states in Mexico that will lend far more authenticity than sending filming of a \"historical\" show to a different country.  Other safe locations include Puebla, Tabasco, Veracruz, Baja Sur (although lately it's getting more dangerous in BCS with the power vacuum left by El Chapo), all would provide authentic locations and sufficient security.\n\nEdit: ColOmbia, not ColUmbia...got it.",

    "postText": "When I read about it, it seemed like a teenager show so def not interested anymore. But then I read the reviews and they were all praising while admitting it is a teenager show yet its so good. So im confused........they all even admit the first 3 eps are slow and then it takes off...like a rocket or something. So im still tempted to check it out but duno if its worth the risk. I loved LOST and similar shows to that, wonder if that helps. But again....im surprised how people say its good while admitting its a teen show....",

I was actually lioking forward to seeing how things progressed in S2. Sucks that the pandemic had to derail that. I still think Netflix should've stuck it out for both The Society and I Am Not Okay With This. They don't realize the value of having gems on their platform. Everyone just wants the big popcorn mega crowd pleaser.",

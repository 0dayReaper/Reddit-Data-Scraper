            "comment": "&gt; To maximize its leverage, SAG-AFTRA has already called for a strike authorization vote. With ballots due at 5 p.m. on Monday, the union will have the authorization in hand when it begins talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on Wednesday.\n\n\n**AI: Rise of the Machines**\n\n&gt; For actors, the AI issue has become front-and-center in the last couple of months, as leaps in technology have raised fears across the creative world. It has become one of the top issues raised by the many SAG-AFTRA members who have joined WGA picket lines in Los Angeles and New York in recent weeks.\n\n&gt; SAG-AFTRA has been looking at the issue for several years, and has incorporated language protecting performers from the use of \u201cdigital doubles\u201d in its commercials agreement and low-budget agreements. The union is now looking for more robust protections in its Basic Agreement, including a provision preventing studios from training AI programs on actors\u2019 work without permission.\n\n\n&gt; The union is not trying to prohibit studios from using AI, and acknowledges that the technology can have benefits for actors. Some performers have already agreed to have their voices cloned, for instance.\n\n\n&gt; But SAG-AFTRA does want to make it clear that any use of AI to replicate an actor or create a new performance must be done with that actor\u2019s consent and with payment.\n\n\n**Streaming Residuals**\n\n&gt; Joe Holt, who has appeared on \u201cWalking Dead: World Beyond\u201d and other shows, said that he used to be able to get a guest star spot on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d and get $9,000 in upfront compensation, which would turn into $20,000 after the show aired in reruns.\n\n\n\n&gt; \u201cStreaming has made that impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re still doing same quality of work, but you\u2019re not getting paid for the \u2018rerun.\u2019 There should be a way to monetize that. It\u2019s out there in perpetuity. People are streaming it all the time.\u201d\n\n\n&gt; George said the lack of residuals in streaming is \u201cthe bane of every working actor.\u201d\n\n\n&gt; \u201cWe know residuals were part of the old system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a precedent. You can\u2019t just say, \u2018This is a different technology.'\u201d\n\n\n&gt; Several actors said they are bothered that streaming residuals are the same regardless of whether a show is a hit or a flop. No one \u2014 not the actors or anyone else \u2014 is even told how many people are watching the show.\n\n\n&gt; \u201cThere is a shell game being played in terms of viewership,\u201d Holt said. \u201cIt feels like they never know exactly what the numbers are until they want to cancel a show. Of course they know how many people are watching. Of course they know how that\u2019s being monetized.\u201d\n\n&gt; The WGA has also been interested in this issue. The DGA agreement, however, provides only for an increased residual based on international subscribers, not a viewership-based residual.\n\n\n&gt; SAG-AFTRA has said it will not be limited by the DGA deal, but the AMPTP has often forced other guilds to accept the pattern adopted by the DGA.",

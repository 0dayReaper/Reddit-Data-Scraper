Molly Shannon is a treasure and this week definitely gave her a great spotlight. From &gt;!Cary\u2019s beau in serial killer mode to Cary finally being dressed down for being a dick this season to Pat\u2019s (justified) meltdown,!&lt; this episode had me laughing so hard I had to pause the show because I was missing the next great joke. &gt;!Also gotta give some credit to Wanda Sykes, because Shuli\u2019s admission about being Q and causing the insurrection to take attention off of how bad Chase\u2019s album was *chef\u2019s kiss*.!&lt;\n- also need to point out how much Ken Marino has been killing it this season, bringing some great emotional vulnerability to his doofus manager, Streeter. Ken Marino is always great, I know, but this season has been extra kind to him.\n\n**SpyxFamily:** absolutely delightful and charming. I\u2019m only 3 episodes into the 25-episode season and I love it so much. It both leans into a lot of typical anime tropes but also turns them around, and it\u2019s a fun watch. If you\u2019re an anime person who hasn\u2019t given this one a shot yet, highly recommend it.",

It's [currently up on Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Homecoming/dp/B09TFZF1LL).  Raff also co-created *Tyrant* (along (FX/Hulu) and created/directed Netflix's *The Spy.*\n\nI also very much liked the South African series, [*Trackers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwsH1_jfgnw)*,* which is on Cinemax but never got pulled into the ~~HBO~~ Max lifeboat.\n\nYou could also give [*The Capture*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-D2I5tE898) (Peacock/BBC) a try. I also loved [*Black Earth Rising*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugxQuVPmVZU) (Netflix), but that's more in the political thriller arena than espionage/action.\n\nThere are also the two AMC/BBC LeCarr\u00e9 adaptations: [*The Night Manager*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfzzLqzEf-I) (on Amazon Prime right now; Hugh Laurie, Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston, Elizabeth Debicki, and a bazillion other familiar faces) and [*The Little Drummer Girl*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GZZ0oXsuQQ) (AMC+; Florence Pugh, Alexander Skarsgard)*.*\n\nLastly, if it's not the Gideon Raff bits of *Homeland* you liked, but rather the *24*\\-ish bits that were done by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa, those two showrunners (along with *House MD* showrunner, David Shore) currently have a Fox/Hulu show, [*Accused*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpPlWCp-kRM), which is a crime non-procedural :) based on the older BBC series by *Cracker's* Jimmy McGovern. It's really good and chock-a-block with famous guest stars, since it's strictly episodic.",

The flaws so far are that it feels hamfisted at times in terms of including typical women's frustrations and slights, and it includes a weird all-knowing internal narrator/God-like figure that's not explained at all and only talks to one character. \n\n**Grand Crew** phew this was terrible. I thought it was going to be a reality show similar to Sweet Life (which I loved and want more of) but it's a soundstage sitcom with very wooden acting and terrible scripting. Noped out almost immediately. \n\n**Season 2 of Prehistoric Planet** Apple TV. David Attenborough is just so precious and fairly vibrating with enthusiasm for the dinos I love it. I find myself thinking about how exciting it must have been for the artists to do the fun stuff like the faux \"thermal camera\" or night vision camera scenes, but that doesn't take away from the awe inspiring work of the artists. \n\n**Shiny Happy People** on Prime. Oof, for those that lived through religious trauma, it's tough going. But it tears the roof off the disgusting and harmful practices and ideas of fundamentalism. \n\n**Fatal Attraction remake** on Prime. Actually decent? I feel that the female lead for Alex is miscast, which is a shame because Joshua Jackson is perfectly cast. I really like the foreshadowing of Dan's entitlement and recklessness in episode 1 when he gets into a wreck after driving drunk and walks away, having a friend help him clean it up and cover it up. I'm iffy on having him be a judge but I get that it ups the stakes in terms of how his life could be ruined. In the 80's it was enough that just being unfaithful could blow up your life. Now the entire justice system has to be at stake, heh.",

I didn't know much about the disaster prior to watching so it was an eye-opening watch. I'd recommend it.\n\nAlso finished: **Burden of Proof** a 4 part docu-series on HBO about the unsolved disappearance of 15 year old Jennifer Pandos in 1987. The documentary follows her brother Stephen Pandos who attempts to uncover what happened and whether his parents played a role in the disappearance of his sister. I'd recommend the documentary.\n\nAlso watched: **The Playing Card Killer** a 3 part doc on Netflix about a serial killer operating in Spain who left playing cards at the scenes of the crime. I'd also recommend this, it's a short binge.\n\nYet to watch:\n\n* **Guilt s3.**\n* **Shiny Happy People (mini).**\n\nLooking forward to: **Black Mirror S6** &amp; **The Righteous Gemstones S3.**",

Otherwise, read the bible front to back, the listen to Tim Minchin. ;)\n\nUpright, the story of a 40-something guy taking a piano across Australia in a Ute with a teen girl.  The actress is great and the guy is a famous comedian/actor, but the show is pretty obscure.\n\nI love Aussie culture, having visited Melbourne when I was younger.  Plus, I've followed Tim Minchin's career for two decades, so I'd suggest you look up Tim Minchin and decide if you like his style of comedy.\n\nI also enjoyed The Queen's Gambit and Ozark, both of which I watched with my mid-70s parents and cringed at all the sex references and bad language (I grew up in the 80s and 90s, but my parents had to ask me what a few things meant, which was pretty awkward).\n\nI sort of lost interest in TV when the pandemic hit, and I was weeks away from graduating from college when the 1998 writers' strike happened (ruining almost every show I liked other than the Simpsons), but even though some of the great late 90s shows haven't come back (I'm looking at you, \"Pushing Daisies\"), a lot of franchises have made comebacks since the pandemic.  \n\nBut I'm so glad that Tim Minchin has been so successful.  His [3 minute song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MermUSeJJc8), one that hi did in different countries for people with different views about stereotypes (My best friend growing up had \"strawberry blonde\" hair, and was never called a \"ginger\"), and in three different versions of his 3-minute song all within a year of each other, he calls out prejudices against at least three different perfectly normal people.\n\nUpright deserves more critical acclaim in my opinion, and I wish his animation film would have been finished, because I've been impressed with everything he's done and it's a shame that he didn't get to compete the 4-year long project he'd put his family and life on hold for.",

            "comment": "Over the past 5 days I have watched these shows:\n\n1. **Yellowjackets S1, S2**\n\nI've had this on my list for ages and I finally got around to watching it - right when S2 ended. I binged both back to back, and thought that this was an excellent show. \n\nThe writing was amazing, the twists and payoffs well worth the watch, and above everything else, the CAST. The younger characters and their older counterparts are so absolutely perfectly cast, I don't think there's a comparison current or past for how good it is.\n\n(A small note here about the younger actresses - all of them are exceptional. It might seem like hyperbole, and probably is, but these might be the most realistic teenagers on television, especially considering we live in a world post-Euphoria and Riverdale. All of these actresses, I have no doubt, are going to go on to do amazing things in TV and film and I can't wait to see their future works.) \n\nIt touches comedy, drama, mystery, thriller, horror genres, and whatever it does, it does brilliantly. The same episode will contain moments that make you laugh out loud AND have one of the most horrific / excruciatingly sad depictions of depravity and trauma.\n\nIf you've been on the fence about this - don't be. I can't wait to see what comes next, and Melanie Lynskey is a very strong contender for Lead Actress after having watched this (although there will most definitely be a Succession sweep this year). There could have been a few improvements in S2 especially towards the end, but seeing the calibre of writing for both seasons I have no doubt these kinks would be ironed out. \n\nAlso - Christina Ricci's character has immediately become an all-time-great for me. Absolutely hilarious and one of the best things about the show. \n\n\n2. **The Great S3**\n\nOf all the young actors working today, I've always wondered how Elle Fanning has been overlooked. I've been following this show from it's first season, and I think if all the categories weren't absolutely stacked this year, Elle Fanning 100% deserves an award for her performance in this. Nicholas Hoult is always great, and unlike the show's subreddit, I was actually fine with some of the plotlines and themes this season. It's as funny as ever, and somehow seems more mature than earlier seasons. Great stuff.\n\n\n3. **Fleishman Is In trouble (Miniseries)**\n\nClaire Danes being one of the actors in the Variety interviews prompted me to Google her recent performances (why else would she be front and center in an actors on actors lineup). The last thing I remembered seeing her in was Homeland.\n\nThis is a miniseries about a couple going through divorce. Your mind could go to 'Scenes From A Marriage' upon hearing this, but this is different. This is simultaneously much lighter and somehow more brutal. \n\nWithout any spoilers, one of the episodes near the end had me crying, the grief, the trauma, the need to be needed by someone. I'm at the lowest point in my life and I could relate to this episode the most and see parallels with my own life.\n\nIf you don't like the first few episodes, keep going because it is all worth it in the end. I thought I wouldn't like Jesse Eisenberg's acting but it was good. Lizzy Caplan was unexpectedly great in this. The script is great - there are a lot of lines sprinkled in there that you could miss at first glance but I found myself rewinding and listening to them again and again.\n\n\n4. **Never Have I Ever S4 (Final Season)** \n\nThis show has never been award worthy, acting or script wise, but it has a soft spot in my heart because it is a teen show with a fresh perspective on the classic coming of age formula, although there are tons of tropes you could spot if you're nitpicky about it. The music choices are always great on this show and all four seasons have given me songs that I never would've discovered otherwise.\n\nThe final season is a good conclusion to the story. Again, the subreddit for this show was weird about 'character ships,' and 'endgame', but to me this was Devi's story through and through. Despite some odd choices and side plots that could have been cut entirely without affecting the outcome, Never Have I Ever was the same heartfelt, breezy summer casual binge it always was to me. I finished it last night and I'm satisfied with how it ended.\n\n\nEdit: to add White House Plumbers, which I just finished\n\n5. **White House Plumbers (Miniseries)**\n\nWhite House Plumbers is about the Watergate scandal. It's a taut 5 episode miniseries that is a satire / farce, which is something you should keep in mind to keep your expectations in check. Justin Theroux is unbelievably great in this and I'm constantly disappointed how and why his agent doesn't get him roles that would make him a much bigger name than he is. I'd be content with more character driver work from him if there were more (and god there needs to be more of JT on screen). \n\nAs someone who knew very little about the details of the scandal, this was a pretty good watch. 5 episodes sounded too little to me but they told a story and it was over, which is refreshing even for a miniseries.",

Perfect for a 90s teen in a horror show.\n\nAnd I've always been a Christina Ricci fan (was disappointed in how little she had to do in Wednesday but that was for the obvious reason) and Misty fucking Quigley is the most fun character I've seen in a TV show in awhile.

Just didn't have the intensity and thrills of the first 4. Great character development though but very little plot and just slow. Watched a couple trailers for season 6 and it looks like it's more of a return to form. I also heard great things about the finale as well.\n\n**The Other Two** \\- This season has been so good, last episode in particular was probably one of the best of the series.\n\n**Dave** \\- I loved the season finale, it was like a mini horror short film, and a certain cameo was the best part. Great season.",

It's not good, but it's not terrible.  There is a good show in there, but this isn't it.  Still good enough to finish.\n\n**Poker Face** on Peacock.  Good show.  The cinematography is fantastic.  It is a mystery of the week type show and it really lets its guest actors cook.  Natasha Leone as the lead typically shows up about halfway through the episode.  It's light and fun and really pretty.",

That and the fact that it sounds like the studio really wanted to push Nicole Beharie out of the show and were successful that made later seasons not as good.\n\nOne of those shows like Twin Peaks where the main mystery seemed to hold it together.",

There's frankly rather little character development and a lack of substantial psychology going on. Complex power dynamics, tension, funny moments, \"Say my name\" moments, great writing, super acting like in Breaking Bad? Not so much I guess. Yeah, I don't get it, really.

It\u2019s a really well done first person account via musicians, producers, and other various VIPs (audio only\u2026.everything else is footage) directly or indirectly related to the early 70s music scene. In essence, the series aims to hold a\na magnifying glass up to how a single year\u2019s music intersected with society, morality, and politics. \n\nBefore I started watching it I always felt like 1968/69 was *the pinnacle year* of music, where an insane amount of top quality records came out. But it turns out I hadn\u2019t given \u201871 enough credit.  \u201871 coincided with a well-defined and dramatic shift immediately following the late 60s era of all things flower power/free love/hippie/psychedelia/revolution and this does a fine job at connecting all of these moving parts into an enjoyable and easy watchin\u2019 retrospective. \n\n[From a NYT review when it first came out in 2021:](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/arts/television/1971-year-music-changed-everything.html)\n\n&gt;&gt;\u2026.Did the music of 1971 really change things more than \u201972? What would 1969 have to say about it? How to begin even making the case?\n\n&gt;&gt;Sometimes you\u2019ve got to make a bold statement,\u201d said Asif Kapadia, the series\u2019s overall director and one of its executive producers, in a video call from London. \u201cFrom our research, there was something amazing about that particular moment, where it comes after the \u201960s, where it comes in terms of the \u201970s, as a turning point.\n\n\nThe Stones are featured *heavily* throughout the doc as is Bowie but there\u2019s also some very well-researched episodes covering Sly and the Family Stone, Tina Turner, Gil Scott-Heron, Joanie Mitchell, Carole King, and Bill Withers all behind the backdrop of Gonzo journalism (Hunter S Thompson), Black Power (the Panthers, Angela Davis), The Weather Underground, glam rock (Marc Bolan et al), Vietnam, and a shit ton of cocaine.",

It's the third time that someone's adapted the Leaphorn/Chee series of books by Tony Hillerman. A feature film was made of *The Dark Wind*. And three more were adapted into *The Navaho Mysteries* on PBS (*Skinwalkers, A Thief of Time*, and *Coyote Waits*) with Wes Studi and Adam Beach.\n\n*Dark Winds* S1 was primarily adapting *Listening Woman* and parts of *People of Darkness*. S2 is going to finish up the *People of Darkness storylines* ([according to GRRM](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2023/02/19/))*.* Hillerman was one of the first friends he made when he moved to New Mexico ([they were introduced by Roger Zelazny](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2021/07/09/a-dark-wind-is-rising/)). \n\n[Rumor is that S2 returns July 30th](https://collider.com/dark-winds-season-2-what-to-expect/) on AMC/AMC+. but so far there's been no official press release stating a premiere date. But they have released [a teaser trailer for S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwwuQrGC7k).",

It did get progressively soapy as it went along - &gt;!Danny's downfall into drug abuse + ensuing fuckups, Karen obsession + general hatred of Ed was all poorly handled and mostly a bit of an eye roll IMO (I did like that he addressed Ed's treatment of Shane, some welcome additional context). The other storyline that felt weak was with Jimmy Stevens + the conspiracy theory turned domestic terrorists group. That went from stealing a statue to blowing up JSC in record time and I didn't buy it.!&lt;  \n\nMinor gripes aside, awesome show. Love most of the characters, love the international tensions, love the 'what could've been' space race of it all, love all of the intense space based action sequences, love the eras + time jumps - it's like a Mad Men + Gravity mashup and I'm all in. If you slept on this one like I did, give it a shot.",

Amy and Danny being Chinese, Viet, Korean and are lower class immigrants. Compared to George who\u2019s Japanese in the arts world who has the cultural polish but not the money.\n\nAmy and Danny are like real people I know. Danny the traditional (if mildly incel-y) blue collar guy with a good heart pulled in too many ways and failing. Amy is the high achiever model minority but has never considered her own happiness. Her material ambitions become a coping mechanism.   \n\nAmy has only been to china once but she\u2019s expected to parade her heritage as some success story. Danny is very Korean but it\u2019s a liability in terms of his world view and is mocked by Paul.\n\n\nThe Korean church scenes are apt. \n\nPaul trying to be a himbo crypto/gym bro is a popular trend among young Asian guys. Isaac being sketchy illegal dude and also participating in the K-town riots shows how Asian guys aren\u2019t just mild doctors. Naomi is also the Asian girl who \u201cmarries up\u201d to a rich white guy but realizes how empty and alone she is, but can\u2019t get rid of the golden handcuffs. \n\nIt\u2019s really cool how much depth the show explores. It also proves that the general audience aren\u2019t drooling racist idiots and can\u2019t handle a minority cast. \n\n\nOn **Ted Lasso**, the finale was touching if unearned. I wish they cut the Keely storylines and had an extra hour or so on Ted. Keely\u2019s storyline also had zero purpose.\n\nShandy and Jack taught Keely not to mix personal and business. She got rug pulled by Jack. Then the solution to her problem is for her friend Rebecca to cut her a massive check. She was literally burned twice before but keeps falling for it.\n\nI know Rebecca is \u201cgood\u201d but Keely has learned nothing.",

He\u2019ll never have that option and resents that. \n\nHe busts his ass and is poor, but a woman can marry rich.

There\u2019s a subtle hierarchy of Asians in America with the Japanese being the most integrated and at the \u201ctop\u201d in terms of social attitudes, and he shifts his goal posts once more. \n\nAgain, women are passive commodity who attract the \u201cchads\u201d with high \u201cvalue\u201d. \n\nHe isn\u2019t 100% wrong as Naomi is all that he hates. But his problem is he initially couldn\u2019t imagine Amy as a self made woman. \n\nHe also makes comments about the original Kayla being a white women and not worth Paul\u2019s time and how he has to marry a nice Korean girl. That gets into more complex intersectionality that I can\u2019t do justice",

If you start watching all of Wainwright's shows, like *Gentleman Jack* (historical drama) and *Last Tango in Halifax* (family dramedy), you'll start to notice she uses the same actors in everything. The showrunner/actress who took over for her on *Scott &amp; Bailey* (Amelia Bullmore. who also plays boss DCI Gill Murray) shows up in S2 of *Happy Valley* as Vicky and in *Gentleman Jack* as Eliza Priestly.",

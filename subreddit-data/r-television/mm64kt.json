Apparently, Eric Andre wanted to have Lavar Burton on and got props for his appearance, but that didn't work out for some reason.  Then, when Lance Reddick was on the show, he was so unphased that Eric was grasping for footage to use, so he asked, \"Would you put on this stuff that I wanted Lavar Burton to wear?\"  And Lance went along with it.  xD",

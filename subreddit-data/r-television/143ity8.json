In fact, it used her return to do new things that both hadn\u2019t been done before and couldn\u2019t be done without a returning character.  \n  \nI mean think about it, is there really nothing that a character who previously travelled with the Doctor, but hasn\u2019t seen them in years could add to one or two episodes?",

I think she\u2019ll at least be a major side character for one or two stories and at most be a recurring character appearing in most of the series\u2019 present-day earth stories. Either way, there\u2019s a decent chance she gets her own spin-off.",

It\u2019s net new, so why not license content to this up and coming player called Netflix?\n\nSecond: Oh shoot, Netflix is growing quite quickly. Soon they\u2019ll be the only place in town we can license streaming rights to because they have the scale to pay top dollar for the content. They\u2019ll start to negotiate much more effectively on price given their scale. Oh what\u2019s that? They\u2019ve started producing their own content in anticipation that we\u2019d limit our licensing to them?\n\nThird: We can either cede the direct customer relationship to Netflix and let them command the streaming space (which is growing\u2026as opposed to other channels), or we can create platforms of our own to guarantee we can still have leverage over them.\n\nFourth: Competition! Everyone has a platform! Only the ones that grow fast will survive! Throw our cheaply financed cash at everything we can greenlight to grow faster than our competitors.\n\nFive: What\u2019s that? Financing has gotten more expensive? And we\u2019ve traded profitability for subscriber growth? And our subscriber growth is plateauing? I\u2019m sure the shareholders will love this\u2026",

As soon as Starz's deal with the studios was up, the studios licensed very little to Netflix (some second-rate crap and a few massive deals that Netflix was willing to overpay for, like Friends and Seinfeld) and that's when Netflix started making Originals (because they had no choice if they wanted new content).",

                    "comment": "It's super interesting because it's a case study in how industry/media disruption can go wrong for everyone involved.\n\nNetflix, like Uber and AirBnb and so many others, saw an opportunity to cut out a middleman or cut costs by subverting existing regulations - and like Google or Facebook, they saw an opportunity to be the ubiquitous platform for their action and money cannon that domination shot at both Google (search) and Facebook (social media).\n\nWhen they made the switch to streaming movies instead of mail-order, the premise, same as Facebook or Airbnb, was that they could operate nearly perpetually at a loss because as long as investors kept them afloat, they would eventually monopolize the market and flip the monetization switch and everyone comes out for the better except for the future consumers and their competitors.\n\nAnd then they hit that ubiquity, muscling out a lot of nascent options and funding tons of 'prestige' tv by outbidding networks - it's time to flip the money switch! \n\nBut the industry isn't an isolated box and Apple and Amazon began operating their own streaming services as essentially loss leaders for their media delivery devices (computers, phones, headsets, prime subscriptions, etc.) while Disney bought out Fox and got control over so much content and production talent that folks wouldn't want to go anywhere else.\n\nDiscovery/HBO/WB and Paramount/Showtime/CBS jumped into the game with the ability to still lean on linear TV income and movie receipts to help prop up production costs and allowed them to wield enticing IP to bring in consumers as well.\n\nSo then the end result is that while Netflix, in a vacuum, basically got what they wanted - they are the only entity that relies on subscriptions to their media production as their sole revenue source. \n\nSince they have effectively hit near their maximum subscriber count, they have no choice but to try to realize their potential return on their investor's money - curtailing password sharing to boost subscribers, cutting costs, and choosing cheaper content to produce.\n\nMeanwhile, the other players can bleed money like a stuck pig because they're almost all operating the streaming service as ancillary to their primary income stream. \n\nBut that's ok, right? Papa Mouse, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Apple will fund infinite series and we'll all be better for it. Except there's only so much quality IP, writing, and production staff out there - so they're throwing comparatively insane budgets behind CW-level products and burning the consumers out on trash. 90% of the shows on streaming are not particularly good and so folks lose interest and drop series sooner and sooner into their runs. Meaning folks aren't visiting the platform as regularly. To keep people on the platforms, you have to do that - even as loss leaders, they're still no good if they're not bringing people in to the shop to buy the other services. So they're getting sucked into the same vortex that Netflix is falling into, where they're just trying desperately to find ways to churn content continuously and end up burning more customers.\n\nAll of this to say I think this goes the back to the OTA/cable strategy of guaranteeing immediate returns by monetizing the views themselves through the use of advertisements, as the tech 'disruption' Netflix was gunning for by pivoting into subscriptions for access to media didn't pan out how they planned and all the streaming services are in a race to the bottom fighting not just for subscribers but for subscriber's attention and engagement.\n\nAnd that's also basically the gist of what happened to cable as well, where it was initially supposed to be effectively subscription funded, and then maybe not so much as too many players came on the scene and the big boys started conglomerating and muscling out or subsuming the 'new blood' competition.",

Stopping any residual payments, effectively taking the expense off their books.\n\n2. Eventually creating demand for those series that they'll they can lease onto FAST platforms while keeping their streaming platforms light on residuals by only hosting the specific new shows that power most of the interest/stave off nonrenewals.\n\nI have no idea if that'll sustain itself long-term, but we have no idea what the next agreements with the various artist's unions will do, or how consumers will react to their streaming expenses in a true recession or depression, which we've not really had in the streaming era outside of COVID, which created insane demand for content for somewhat obvious reasons.\n\nWill people cut cords and go to Freeform or Tubi or whatever it is? No idea. Could they go online only? Fundamentally the viewing experience for most streaming in households is pretty similar to how it was in the days of cable. Can a family each individually watch different things on their phones/tablets/laptops/etc? Sure, but many families had multiple TVs too. So that's not fundamentally different - and the self-published content on the web (Youtube, Tik-tok, Twitch) is ad-supported and funded by entertainment corporations in the same way as streaming services outside of a comparatively small subsection of Patreon supported artists.\n\nIf anything fundamentally changes about the industry, I would love to see Patreon take a larger role in supporting artists. Ultimately, the larger and larger corporations will take over those online spaces and sign and generate new artists like music labels have done - as opposed to entirely self-owned entertainment eponymous entities that still exist in the online space - but at the very least it's the extreme end-point of a la carte pricing. I only pay for what specific *show* I want to watch, rather than a cable package, streaming service, or other such bundling that amortizes viewers specific interests across various topics/types of entertainment to collectively subsidize a lot of stuff I won't watch.",

It would be interesting to see two tiers of different streaming services, a handful each of FAST and subscription-based services mimicking OTA and cable TV, with truly ad-free services being expensive enough to be seen as more of a luxury, kind of like HBO/Showtime/etc. on cable packages. Young people definitely aren't going to start getting cable so they can't put the streaming genie back in the bottle, but I honestly wouldn't hate it if I could still get access to everything for much cheaper than cable.

You have a direct revenue correlate to usage (the more they watch the more I make!) and once you have an ad model at scale it becomes easier to sell/package ads. I\u2019d like to believe there will always be an ad free tier, but there\u2019s some incentive to not create one: ironically, the higher you price an ad free tier, the more you are selecting for high value customers that advertisers want to reach. Maybe it will persist if they find a particularly large group of churners who always leave when there\u2019s ads, but when you\u2019re capped out on sub growth and your economist tells you you\u2019re already priced competitively, ads is one of the last things to flex to drive revenue growth",

More viewers meant higher ad rates, and the biggest hits could be sold to syndication and international markets. The people behind those hits got a cut, which is why the duo who invented Friends probably haven\u2019t flown commercial since the 1990s. Streaming shows, in contrast, have fewer ads (or none at all) and are typically confined to their original platforms forever. For the people who make TV, the connection between ratings and reward has been severed.\n\n\n* So who is getting rich off hits like The Night Agent? Not streaming services, no matter how many global viewing hours they accumulate. Many streamers have spent themselves into billions of dollars of debt building their content libraries, and subscription fees haven\u2019t grown fast enough to close the gap. If platforms like Netflix make any money at all, it is only a fraction of what entertainment companies used to make back when more than 105 million U.S. households spent an average of $75 per month on cable.\n\n\n* \u201cThe entire industry,\u201d says the director Steven Soderbergh, who has been navigating structural changes in Hollywood since 1989\u2019s Sex, Lies, and Videotape, \u201chas moved from a world of Newtonian economics into a world of quantum economics, where two things that seem to be in opposition can be true at the same time: You can have a massive hit on your platform, but it\u2019s not actually doing anything to increase your platform\u2019s revenue. It\u2019s absolutely conceivable that the streaming subscription model is the crypto of the entertainment business.\u201d\n\n\nLooks like an informative article, going to read the rest later, but Vulture really needs to add a summary, key points or TLDR at the end of their loooooooooong articles.",

Licensors make only 5-10% of each sale, depending on what kind of merchandise it is (e.g. clothes, toys, sweets/snacks, etc). For reference, Disney is far and away the biggest consumer products licensor in the entire world, pushing about 50b in merch each year. Of that eye popping number, it only sees about 4-5b a year. And they dwarf the competition; the next biggest licensor in entertainment is WB, with iirc about 10b a year. And that's the *entirety* of consumer product sales across their entire portfolio; for a non-toyetic show like Night Agent that maybe sells a few T-shirts and baseball caps, the merchandise revenue is effectively nil. The economics get a lot better if you own your own retailers or have theme parks, but basically only Disney and Universal have that. \n\nThe fact is, the vast majority of entertainment dollars come from direct sale of the entertainment itself, e.g. movie ticket sales, home video, cable fees, subscriptions, and advertising. Merchandise won't paper over the huge hole in economics that streaming has caused.",

You can buy the majority of video games on Steam (or just use other similar apps). They're all basically released everywhere on day 1. They're automatically yours forever (until such a potential when Steam goes down - but you can easily extract and secure the files if you worry about that).\n\nThe same is not remotely true with TV. I understand that multiple streaming services were obviously going to emerge as TV production expanded. I understand that expecting to be able to watch everything on Netflix for \u00a39.99 a month was never going to be realistic. But alongside these streaming services, a Steam-type client should've emerged allowing people to just buy seasons of content on the services. For people who want to legally keep what they watch, paying something like \u00a35-15 per season (with sales much like Steam). No geoblocks. No restrictions.",

Digital games on steam, gog, etc stay available even after publishers pull them from storefronts when agreements expire with the only exception I know of was a retro game where an original developer falsely claimed to have gotten current rights holders to sign off on selling the game. It seems like everything else from movies to tv shows to ebooks though gets purged from servers, paid customers be damned. Really makes me hold off on buying shows digitally on anything but apple where the files can be downloaded. Although I've never tried playing files on a different pc so IDK how well that actually works. Sadly I worry that pushing for reform in this would just lead to companies lobbying to erode game ownership to be just as bad instead of respecting customers purchases for other media.\n\nI'd also like to complain about digital versions costing just as much but not having the deleted scenes, commentary, and other special features. It's like publishers push buying digital editions to save money on manufacturing but offer the shoddiest options for it.",

From 2012-2022 Netflix trained us to expect on-demand, all episodes of a season dropped at once, zero ads, no cable box fee per tv, no contract, all for about $12 per month. And for some \u201ccustomers\u201d, not paying that $12 at all. That is a big difference from the average of $75 per household cable package with ads in 2010. \n\n&gt;\tBut what at first looked like a Netflix correction was in fact a streaming correction. Investors started punishing Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and other Netflix wannabes. \u201cWall Street woke up and said, \u2018Actually, profitability is the only metric,\u2019\u201d says a senior executive at a major streamer. \u201cThe idea that you could have the optics of success, where you could add 5 million subscribers and you gained 10 percent in value?

They all want to write Barry.  And you know who watches Barry?  Nobody.\"  \n\nHollywood has been absolutely dumb for the last decade and they are paying the price for their stupidity. The legacy industry thought that it was enough to say that it was a bigtech to be a bigtech. Did they help destroy the traditional linear model and now cry wanting something like that back? No. The audience will not return. The world has changed and either you adapt or you die. \n\nNetflix shouldn't be blamed for innovating and offering something better for the common viewer. The general audience is on Tiktok or Instagram, by the way. It's not like audiences just come off cable to watch Netflix. They would leave anyway. \n\nAnd Hollywood is stupid (and that includes the press, critics and awards) when it thinks it has the power to decide what is prestige and what is not  Who can care about prestige is Apple, which just wants people to find the company wonderful and buy a new iPhone every year. How many shows longer than 12 episodes are up for an Emmy, by the way? See Axios' report, released today, on media coverage of Succession that the real world didn't care about.  \n\nHollywood is reaping what it sowed and now it doesn't know what to do. And I suspect there isn't much to do. Now the producers, writers and directors (and their egos) go after Amazon and Apple which, as the report says, still has free cash (and this sub hates that anyone says that, even if it's true). But, as also mentioned, the TV and movie business for the real bigtechs is not necessary and they can just shut down without any harm. Then Hollywood will do their \"passion projects full of egos but no audience\", with whom?",

I can just mind my own business on my phone till the thing starts.  B) No more dropping all eps at once. It's just a fact that week to week keeps people coming back/talking about your service. Plus, because you don't have to feed people an entire new show every week, you can put a cap on the number of scripted shows you're gonna produce that year that's not gonna break the bank. C) They need to start thinking like traditional networks. Not every show has to be the new GOT, Westworld etc. There is NOTHING WRONG with producibg shows that are just fun, have mass appeal and a mid tier budget that doesn't break the bank.",

The entire estate used to be credited with that criticism, but it will be interesting to see how much of it was actually just Christopher, and whether younger generations are as protective. \n\nEdit: the original commenter seems to have corrected from \u201cgrandson\u201d to \u201celdest son\u201d which is *so close*, but Christopher is actually JRR\u2019s *youngest* son (his elder two brothers have passed away).

They could do to it what they did to The Hobbit. \n\nI just hope that those in charge make the right decisions. ",

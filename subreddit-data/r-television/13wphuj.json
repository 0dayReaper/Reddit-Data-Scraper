You think a *politician* is doing that?\n\nObama is saying what he thinks will guide the situation to an equitable outcome. One of the pitfalls there is that Obama, like pretty much every ex-President, is a polarizing figure; to the extent that he appears to attach himself to one side of the issue, he polarizes public opinion about that side. If he comes out and says \"writers rule, execs drool\" then he makes the WGA much less popular with Republicans and people who are right-aligned because they *don't like Obama.* Presidents make compromise *harder* by championing one side of the issue - this is something Biden is the master of, and genuinely something the Obama administration struggled with. I guess he's learning, though.\n\nThe best thing he can do is raise the salience of the issue without appearing to assign himself to one side of it.",

You\u2019d even have CEO talking about how profits should go towards helping employees. It was part of what was called Welfare Capitalism and it worked pretty decent for the US (ignoring the many other social and intentional issues)\n\nPersonally I attribute that success partially to the Cold War. The people running the show had a motivation to make sure capitalism was working for the workers as well, since they were competing against an alternative which was the workers rising up and killing them. No competing system, less to be worried about. That and spending the 70s-90s brainwashing 60% of the population to hate anything they can claim is socialism/communism. \n\n\nYou can see it happen partially by looking at CEO to worker pay. \n\n1970: 20x\n\n1980: 30x\n\n1990: 60x\n\n\n2000: 375x",

Given that AI currently works from datasets to predict the most probable outcome, a person could really feed it years of trends, market performances, goals, HR rules, company values, stock holder meetings, etc. and likely get an AI that makes the same kind of decisions, if not better, as management and execs. Hell, it might even be better at predicting best productive value decisions than the humans behind the suits. If anyone should be fearing for their jobs long term it should be the suits. Once shareholders figure out they can raise their profits by eliminating million dollar jobs by replacing them with free working AI, the capitalism leopard will eat their faces faster than they can buy a yacht.",

I guess when your fat and powerful the rules don't apply anymore. Probably still showing that same video today.\n\nIt is very true, or unions are so bad why do companies fight tooth and nail to stop unions? If the company wanted to treat you good and not have unions, they would pay you good money and not care about union activity. Places like Walmart would pay you nothing if they could get away with it.",

He talks about how he was the writer, but there during casting, at other pre-production meetings along the way, there during some filming, even talking to directors, actors, etc.\n\nNow writers are often brought in for these high intensity camps (I forget the official term for it) where they are put in a room, told to crank out material, and once that part is done, they are sent home, having nothing to do with the production ever again.  So they never learn any more, they never experience any other part of the process.  So the pipeline for new showrunners and other positions is now devoid of writers altogether, and their input in any production has been dropped as soon as the ink is dry on the first draft.",

Its fucking bullshit amd time for it to end. \n\nIf i had a company like Amazon, i wouldnt ever let my lowest level employee be paid poorly. It would be an HONOR to clean the bathrooms at Amazon. I\u2019d make it the highest paying custodial job ever, because that person IS ON MY TEAM. I wouldnt ever let my CEO salary exceed a few million each year because nobody that much money is conpletely unnecessary. I enjoy nice things just like anyone else, but buying a 50million dollar home when you can buy a nice fucking house for 3million is a complete waste of resources. That\u2019s 47 million that can go towards kids, education, &amp; community. I get that some people will disagree with me on this, but to that person: you don\u2019t fully understand what is important in life. Hint: its not hoards and hoards of money and material things.\n\nI enjoyed this rant. Thanks for reading.",

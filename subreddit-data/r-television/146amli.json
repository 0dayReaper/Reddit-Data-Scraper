Those are dad jokes, meant to be obviously ridiculous, but he played them straight.  Charlie is naive, but not that out of contact with reality unless he's on inhalents.  And then with the rest of the gang all arriving within minutes of the discovery, it felt too conveniently plot-serving.  Are they finally jumping the shark?

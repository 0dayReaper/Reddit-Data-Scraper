They also can run them for longer for the most part because of the low costs. The article brings that up. \n\nPreemium tv is more expensive and HBO nowadays generally has shows cap out between 8-10 episodes.",

Now, despite owning both the HBO and Warner Bros. brands, they've chosen to compete with prominent names like Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, and Paramount with...\"Max\".\n\nI wonder how wise that choice will seem when we look back at it 10 years from now.",

Really should have gone back to their Warner Brother's roots, because that brand has name power too, and is already completely watered down by multiple mergers, so why not just start fresh and put it all under that umbrella.\n\nWe all know that Marvel on Disney, would have been easy for people to find out HBO is on Warner, but yeah, Max is a pretty awful attempt at saving face on a failed re-brand.",

It's only Westworld right now, but if Pluto offered them $100 million or whatever it would take to buy exclusive streaming rights for Deadwood or The Wire, that shit would disappear overnight if the financials made sense.",

Co-productions like Extras and Life's Too Short are also no longer there, but those were always going to be limited because HBO was never the sole owner. I think a lot of the Spanish content was co-produced as well, but I'm not sure. \n\nHey, if it turns out to just be Westworld or if they keep the programming on Max and let another network show it, like what they're doing with True Blood and Silicon Valley on TBS, no big deal. I just would like a service that has all of HBO's linear Sunday night shit going back 25ish years when they started seriously pumping out shows. Basically how HBO has been from HBO Go until very recently. Maybe that's just not profitable.",

Plus House of the Dragon, Euphoria and The Last of Us are huge hits. None of those Apple shows lighting the world on fire. Ted Lasso (a B show at best IMO) is their only really hit show. I can name other smaller great HBO shows that I can\u2019t say are lighting the world on fire that can go toe to toe with any of those shows listed and are even better like Somebody Somewhere or My Brilliant Friend. Let alone the legacy shows that are WAY better than those (and some of it really not that old - definitely in the lifetime of Apple TV+ existing like Chernobyl or Watchmen).\n\nI won\u2019t compare a BBC produced nature doc like Prehistoric Planet to anything else and sure, that\u2019s great, but a totally different category and all Apple did (like ALL of their shows) is just license it. HBO owns the vast majority of its content and doesn\u2019t operate like some broadcast network like Apple does and just licensed everything (speaking about HBO specifically here and not Max broadly). In ten years, Ted Lasso could be on Max for all we know since Warner Bros. Television produced it (just like how Seinfeld is on Netflix and not Peacock, despite it originally airing on NBC). HBO content is HBO content, not someone else\u2019s.",

In the last year and a half HBO had The Last of Us, White Lotus Season 2, Barry S4, Succession S4, The Righteous Gemstones, and House of the Dragon? How are they going downhill? its crazy to think the quality of HBO has already gone when they have been dropping great seasons of television for so long. Just because you have to wait a few weeks or months for the next great thing doesn't mean the quality is gone now, every other streaming service would die to have as much quality content HBO consistently puts out.",

By the time it ended we were all 30 or 40-somethings and even had boyfriends/husbands joining us some weeks haha \n\nAbsolutely a comfort show in so many ways!",

It used to be really good trashy TV with huge fights and multiple twists per episode. Now it's just recon, quick argument with Jon, heart to heart, training, and re-opening. It's pretty much over after the first 6 minutes now.",

I could easily name 10 off the top of my head without even consulting \"the list\" of shows I'm interested in watching, which is probably 30+ long\n\n\nhow do y'all have time to devote to these terrible shows when there's so much good programming out there already and tons more that came out in the last 35 years that most have probably never seen",

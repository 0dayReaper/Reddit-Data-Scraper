[An entire extra episode was filmed](https://i.redd.it/32zdsjejxc3b1.png) but for whatever reason the order for the season got reduced to 9 episodes. \n\nSome of the cut content includes:\n\n* An entire plotline between Coach Ben and Javi was cut, &gt;!this was to explain why he went homicidal on the girls after they ate Javi!&lt; \n* A scene was filmed illustrating how the girls worked out the card system &gt;!for how they choose who to hunt!&lt;\n* A conversation between Lottie and Shauna in which they bury the hatchet\n* A flashback illustrating the backstory of the owner of the cabin, played by Jason Ritter",

Some of the weakest parts of S2 were the narrative jumps in the back half of the season following other episodes where practically nothing of note happened. \n\nThe card system came out of absolutely nowhere and I just assumed Coach Ben was paranoid and scared of the girls (which wasn\u2019t the most convincing motive for his actions). Both those cut stories would have helped flesh out those final few episodes.",

By episode six I got a sinking feeling that the writers didn't have a clue as to what they were doing. And maybe the season could have been salvaged by an incredible, sensational, jaw dropping finale. Well my jaw dropped alright - in total disbelief of how unbelievably awful it was. I cannot believe that the same people who brought us season one of Yellowjackets, the best show since Breaking Bad, then followed it up with a sophomore season that got exponentially worse as it went along until it culminated into an outright catastrophic ending that appears to have been cobbled together with reshoots, terrible writing, bad editing and an insanely impossible to believe storyline. Season two was like reordering one of the best meals you ever had and then being given a shit sandwich. I cannot comprehend what the hell happened behind the scenes to make it go as far awry as it did. Ok, I'm done ranting.",

They obviously has decent number tho, because the marketing was a lot heavier going into s2. People started coming up and asking me about that show I was talking about. They were excited. \n\nNow I kinda feel like a fucking fool lmfao. I legit stopped watching the show as it aired after episode 5 because I was bored as shit. I haven\u2019t even actually finished the season yet. This season was just so god damn boring and went absolutely nowhere. They tricked me man, they god damn tricked me",

There's no way these actors aren't disappointed with the way the show is going.",

They added Wood, but was so lazy to develop him, so just made this silly premise that hes like male version of Misty (wow so cool Showtime) and past timeline is actually would be better if they just keep copy Lost, at this point i would be more happy that if they found bunker, time machine or government experiments, at least some clich\u00e9, instead of dull dialogues.",

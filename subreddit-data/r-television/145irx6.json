However, they often turn off the A/C for shooting (so it\u2019s quieter for sound). The more modern way of shooting is lots of rolling takes because it\u2019s all digital and not film, so the A/C is off for much longer. After awhile, the biggest reason it gets hot is all the warm bodies of crew and actors, particularly in small sets. Fun fact, after a few hours it all smells like armpit.",

Similar to traditional florescent tubes a layer of material is used to absorb the base narrow band light and re emit in other colors. This produces a more natural (but still lumpy) spectrum. \n\nIn the end, LED stage lighting is no where near theoretical narrow band efficiency, but still far better than tungsten, arcs or HID. \n\nHowever, DPs still use the older lighting instruments sometimes, as LEDs tend to make faces look ruddy. That's caused by a slight mismatch in the peak of LED red color emission and the red filter on digital cine camera sensors Bayer filters. Why don't we fix the LED color or Bayer filter?

The difference in Andor is the facility was managed exclusively by humans working for the Empire, not by aliens. The Empire was mostly run by humans.\n\nIt would be interesting to see a show cover how the Empire treats aliens. Like are they sent to camps as well, or just killed?",

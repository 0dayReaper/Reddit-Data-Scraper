    "postText": "the most boring show I watched in my entire life. Sure there was some good things about the show, like the cartel stuff but if it wasn't for that I would have ended watching the series after season 2. But then again it was just not worth the amount of time I put into the series. After every episode and every season I was telling myself time and time again maybe the next episode would be good. But after watching the entire series and watching the last episode I am so pissed at the amount of time I wasted watching this show, It sucked. Why did every episode have to be an hour long. Most of the show was montages with boring plots such as the mess verde BS, who cares? I loved breaking bad a lot and I thought that better call Saul will be like breaking bad but it was just not worth it. if You are thinking about watching this series, think again and don't.",

The 2 shows are obviously fairly similar in tone and structure. Even If one was boring, by default the other should be as well. BrBa would have a scene or 2 of action every season (minus the end) Saul id argue probably had just as many of not more action scenes. \n\nBy far the most boring show you've ever seen? I'd say that'd a pretty high bar to complain about. That or you've watched about 5 shows in total, in which tells more about you.",

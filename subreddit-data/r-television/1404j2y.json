Filming wildly varies, one day could be 9 hours, the next could be 17, I doubt they just send the ADs home if they hit their daily limit.\n\nIt sounds like more work for the payroll department lol.",

And you have great shows written with big rooms.\n\nCreators should be free to make their writing rooms as big or small as they want, like writers in any other medium can. But the end of mini rooms (where they write the pilot for almost no pay and are let go when it's picked up) and better conditions are definitely valid. Hopefully studios will agree to a sensible compromise soon",

There\u2019s an easier way for the writers to solve mandatory staffing without hamstringing showrunners who want to create and write an entire season of television. **Remove financial incentive for studios to keep rooms as small as possible.**           \n\nIn TV, for every dollar a writer earns in fees, the studio contributes approximately 20% ($.20 on the dollar) in additional funds to the WGA\u2019s pension and health/paid parental leave funds.     \n\nHowever, the studios only owe that ~20% contribution on the first $225k that a writer earns. If a writer is paid $300k, then the studio only pays that ~20% on the first $225k and the remaining $75k does not generate any type of contribution.     \n\nWhen a single season of 10 episodes is written by 1 or 2 writers, the writer fees far exceed $225k or $450k, respectively, but the pension and health contributions will only be ~20% of that $225k or $450k, respectively.      \n\nIf that same 10 episode show has 4 writers on it, then the pension and health contribution cap would be ~20% of $900k ($225k x 4 writers).     \n\nIf that same 10 episode show has 6 writers on it, then the pension and health contribution cap would be ~20% of $1.35m ($225k x 6 writers).     \n\nThe WGA should pivot to a new pension and health contribution cap, which would be the higher of:     \ni. $225k x # of writers for that season of TV; or.    \nii. $225k x # of episodes produced for that season of TV.",

AI cannot replace anyone in the DGA, it can't replace anyone on the WGA but the studios don't believe that. The studios don't want to pay writers - they want fewer of them and want to replace them with AI.  \n  \nThe issue that creates isn't about quality control as much as it destroys the pipeline of training showrunners. More people in writers rooms means you're training more people. Right now, we have an issue where writers get promoted to showrunner and have absolutely no idea how to run a show. Multiple writers have talked about this specific issue.  \n  \nVG is so talented because he worked every facet of the process (going all the way back to xfiles days), so when he became showrunner he was wildly successful at having his vision accomplished because he knew how it all fit together. When shows fail it's not about the writing room - it's about the showrunner's inability to connect all the processes and deliver the product they want.  \n  \nBut it's easier to blame writing rooms than take accountability for poor middle/upper management and development pipelines.",

The reason the AI fight wasn't hard for the DGA is because you can't replace a stage manager with AI and they weren't going to pretend otherwise, but it was easy for studios to say: see! AI isnt the only thing!  \n  \nBut it's a HUGE thing for the WGA fight. So I disagree that that isn't the core issue. It is, because it's the number one way studios believe they can get around paying less for products.  \n  \nI see a lot of comments about min writing rooms and public consensus being that's inherently bad because \"X favourite show was made by a single writer!\" Well, if you force more people out of writers room, guess who's left? It's not always the most qualified and talented people. Never has been, never will be. It'll be the most connected and established people.  \n  \nContent is going to be consolidated. Think how many hundreds of Netflix shows are out there that no one fucking watches. How many Roku shows? All that shit is going to get culled and writers will get washed out because less content will be made compared to right now. We don't need to also cull writing rooms thinking AI can assist two writers so studio execs can continue to make fat bank sitting at the top.  \n  \nWhen your favourite show gets bad it's because of a failed show runner, not the writing rooms. Those rooms are basically tools for the showrunner to direct and lead and approve. So many writers make drafts only to have show runners give notes back to make shit ridiculous, but their job is to listen to their boss.",

And most shows, whether they are half an hour or an hour, are more than 90 minutes long. Plus, comedy shows, which usually fall into the half an hour bracket, are constantly being rewritten while the episode is shooting, so it makes sense to have the writers around throughout production. The guild\u2019s demands are very reasonable, especially when you consider the outrageous CEO and executive pay and the billions that the industry earns year after year after year.",

You might be able to pick out a few exceptional examples that worked out fine with a single writer, but for the vast majority of great TV shows that is not the case.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe adding more writers to Chernobyl would've made it even better.

There are also quarter loads and half loads. Blanks also usually have no \"point\" or projectile.   \n\n\nI'd have to look up the details for the Rust incident, but Brandon Lee died because the armourer wasn't on set and a random truck driver dumped the powder out of some real bullets to make blanks, and then a piece of the casing ALSO got stuck in the barrel.   \nGenerally, there are enough safety checks and balances that it shouldn't be possible to fire an actual real bullet out of the gun, but Rust was so low budget I don't even know if they had movie guns or just REAL guns that someone owned privately. I read somewhere the crew was shooting the guns in the parking lot for fun, because they were cool vintage guns??",

Game theory does state that in a ONE-OFF prisoner\u2019s dilemma, wherein the choice is only presented to the respective actors one time, that the best strategy is to always defect (betray your partner). Your potential gains and your risk of loss are both respectively too high to do otherwise rationally. \n\nBut in the real world, especially with organizations representing many thousands of people that are likely to exist for much longer than the typical human lifespan, these choices are not one-offs. Union negotiations occur with some regularity across decades. For that reason, this situation is more akin to a simulated, REPEATED prisoner\u2019s dilemma, in which both actors are aware of the previous actions taken by their counterparts in the previous rounds. \n\nIn a repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma, game theory is mathematically quite clear that the best overall strategy (provided there are at least 3 iterations and that the dilemmas continue indefinitely) is called tit-for-tat. Meaning you begin the first round by cooperating rather than defecting, and for every subsequent round you make the same choice as your counterpart made in the previous round. Tit-for-tat. As your counterpart realizes that your choice is directly correlated to their previous choice, their strategy too must evolve. \n\nE.g. in round one I cooperate and you defect. You benefit a lot and I lose massively. In round two I copy your previous decision and defect, and you would likely defect again. We both lose big. If you continue to follow the logic of a one-off prisoner\u2019s dilemma, then you will always defect, and I, after round 1, will also always defect accordingly. Mutually assured destruction. \n\nThis is about the worst way a repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma can go. Over time, it serves to ensure bad outcomes for all (usually discussed in terms of evolutionary fitness) and the species which cannot grow to cooperate over time will perish. \n\nBUT, because humans are capable of being rational actors in the face of social problems, we have learned to cooperate with each other for our mutual evolutionary advantage, SO LONG AS our counterparts also consistently choose to cooperate. On a societal scale, this tit-for-tat strategy informs much of our competition and cooperation, especially in smaller communities where your previous actions are more easily linked to you over time. Defectors, over time, are harshly punished, because their counterparts learn from history and choose not to cooperate with them, specifically.\n\nOf course, the world is enormous and enormously complex, so there are many instances in human life in our global society where actors can consistently betray their counterparts and avoid punishment for it. Some instances in life are just more akin to a one-off prisoner\u2019s dilemma, in which case, per game theory, being ruthless is to your benefit. But overall, and especially in this instance, humans are better served by following tit-for-tat strategies. \n\nWhat you can take away from my long-winded ramble is that in this instance, the DGA may benefit in the short term, but there is no guarantee their counterparts will not remember their betrayal and respond accordingly in the future, to the long-term detriment of all parties involved. In which case the DGA\u2019s choice in this instance likely may have harmed their \u201cevolutionary fitness\u201d overall. \n\nSolidarity forever.",

The tit-for-tat strategy only works if the participants actually cared about the future to enough of a significant degree.

She shot the episode and she got paid for shooting it and it had its original airing. This airing did not have a residual payment.\n\nNBC over christmas decides to re-run the episode during the hiatus. They air it once on Thursday at 9. Aniston gets a residual payment for that airing. She gets the same payment if 1 person watches the rerun or 20 million people watch it.\n\nNow TBS, seeing how popular Friends was, decides to syndicate it. They air the episode on a Saturday and 11pm and again the next day at noon and Aniston gets paid two residual fees (each successive rerun is a slightly smaller residual fee until it hits a valley). Again, she gets the same amount regardless of viewership.\n\nFor streaming, with everything being on demand, there isn\u2019t a clear cut \u201cthis was a rerun\u201d so currently, it\u2019s based on a specific length of time the series is listed on the service. (I am unsure of the specific length of time) I have heard that 13 weeks is about it. So if the episode of Friends is on Netflix for 13 weeks, Aniston gets a residual payment. Again, not based on viewership. 100 million people could watch that episode and it doesn\u2019t matter, she gets the same fee.\n\nAs for those actors you mentioned, it\u2019s likely they don\u2019t know how residuals work (you\u2019d be amazed how many don\u2019t) or they were misinterpreted. The sudden jump could just be because some little cable network decided to have a mini marathon at some pint to fill the schedule one day.",

I wholeheartedly support their strike, and demands for more equity. But the amount of petulance and vitriol coming from such a loud portion of them upon the news of our tentative agreement is disheartening.\n\nThe writers deserve better, but so does everyone else. Shorter days and better pay are some of the biggest concerns of us DGA members, and our negotiators largely addressed that. We can\u2019t be expected to tank our own negotiations with the AMPTP because of the writers\u2019 strike. And I wouldn\u2019t expect them to do that either if the roles were reversed. \n\nThere\u2019s so many members of all of our unions who insist on blasting their opinions about a negotiating process they have absolutely no idea about. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 fuck the AMPTP. But if you think you\u2019re going to force them to change direction completely with one contract negotiation, your expectations will never be met. True change, when it actually happens, is usually incremental.\n\nEDIT: The writers also have specific demands for, what I **think** is the biggest negotiating hurdle: room minimums. Which I totally get, it makes sense. But, if I had to bet money, I think that\u2019s their biggest fighting point right now with the AMPTP. The DGA didn\u2019t really have any institutional demands like that.",

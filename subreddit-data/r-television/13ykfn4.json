I also wouldn't say it's heavily lesbian focus, all of that is in the background, it's just a small town with a big lesbian population.",

The ack of country was both incredibly woke and brilliantly on target at the same time. I'm always wondering when someone doing one of those is going to crack. Plus the absurdity of a small town in Tasmania that seems to be 50% lesbian, which you can just abotu imagine being true. That seems to describe their whole schtick to me and I don't know how they do it but they straddle the line of overtly annoying wokeness with amazing humour. I've loved them since their cooking show on YouTube.\n\nRemember, all we need is 400 ducks.",

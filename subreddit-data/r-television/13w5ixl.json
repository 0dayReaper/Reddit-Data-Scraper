    "postText": "Severance, Foundation, Silo are all accessible Sci fi  that start off good, are easy to watch, and have some pretty interesting unique and in depth stories.  I also have found that they have solid acting, realistic(if not amazing diologue).  3 solid sci fi shows all within about a year of each other... pretty amazing in my book.\n\nI feel the biggest problem with sci fi is that often there is a character or storyline, or diologue that sucks and you feel like you are slogging through the show just so you can hear more about the interesting sci fi/fantasy concepts.  These shows aren't like that.  I never feel like I am slogging through crap diologue or crap acting or crap storylines like I do with a lot of modern sci fi.",

Like if you wikipedia while you watch that show, most of the characters and even the rockets/technology in the show are based on real people, and based on real projects NASA had that were abandoned(like the rocket that launches from ocean was a real idea/project nasa had, well as the Nazi being the father of NASA).",

There are several very different shows running at once, most of them good and approaching Trek from different perspectives. \n\nPicard S3 nailed the nostalgia aspect, undid all the sour tastes the first two seasons created, and left that era of the timeline in potentially great hands for a new series with Captain Seven. Strange New Worlds is doing the adventure-of-the-week thing everyone wanted almost perfectly and even elevating the concept by dabbling in some TOS lore. Lower Decks is essentially a perfect animated series for this universe, outrageously funny every episode. Discovery has been, at best, inconsistent but we'll see how the last season wraps things up, hopefully there's more potential for 31st century Trek. And I still gotta watch Prodigy but people seem to like it. The last word I'd use to describe trek right now is \"goofy.\"",

It being for kids doesn't mean adults can't or don't also enjoy it, but it does shape the approach taken to the story, and the Star Wars movies have always been designed with kids in mind. ROTJ is included in that, if you can watch the documentaries about it and read the contemporary interviews, Lucas talks about testing early drafts and cuts with kids and rewriting bits they couldn't follow, writing the Ewoks in imagining the audience going home and playing Rebels and Ewoks like Cowboys and Indians, designing things with toys in mind. In the creator's own words: \"There is a group of fans for the films that doesn't like comic sidekicks. The movies are for children but they don't want to admit that. In the first film they absolutely hated R2 and C-3PO. In the second film they didn't like Yoda and in the third one they hated the Ewoks. Most people don't like toys and don't think children should be able to play with toys. But I'm a big fan of toys, and I think it helps kids be able to play and expand their imaginations. To contribute to that is I think a good thing\" and \"The big complaint about the first film was that it was a special effects movie and that there was no character to the story. It was a children's film, and that is pretty much the way the critics have addressed all the movies.\"",

The production values were amazing, and the show looked like a million bucks. I was really disappointed that Netflix cancelled it, and I hope Apple TV or another network will pick it up.

And then the ending made it all kinda meaningless anyway. \n\nIt was a massive step down from Dark and it\u2019s good it was canceled so the creators know they can\u2019t just lean on this kind of lazy storytelling.

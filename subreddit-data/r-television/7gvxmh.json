I thought it was done pretty believably, too. \n\nRight from the start you knew he was better than those assholes he hung out with - he just lapsed into the macho-thing a little too much. But he was really just a little too cocky and hanging with some real asshats.\n\nSpeaking of those other two, that guy they cast as the jerk friend is sooo good. Every time he opens his mouth or even just smiles, I get such a raw, almost primal, urge to try and beat him to death with a shoe.",

After he tried to take control of #3's powers through the Aparatus Machine, he succumbed to the power of the upside down and had to be killed by Max in the most tragic moment ever captured on film. However, he wasn't really dead! Much like papa, he survived in limbo and together Smooth Boy and Papa talked #6 into killing the series most beloved character: #2. Sadly, #11 and #0 weren't in time and to stop #6 and had to spend the next 2 seasons chasing it while #6 kept sending bad guys after bad guys at them. Finally they corner #6 through the help of #11's mom... or so they thought. Suddenly #12 appears. 12 Has been in control of all these monsters, from the big tentacle monster to the sea otters, they were all send by him. He created the Upsidedown because [insert random villain plot here *mwuhahaha*]. Papa and Smooth Boy cry knowing they have been manipulated by #12 this whole time. All numbers (both good and bad), join forces to fight #12. They are no match for him. He wipes them out with one fell swoop. When all hope is lost, Will arrives on his bike. \"Oh no everyone is dead! Nooooooooooo\". It is at that moment that he unlocks his own powers, enters the Upsidedown once more, and defeats #12. Papa and Smooth Boy are resurrected and freed from Limbo. Papa starts a daycare and promises to change his life around. Smooth Boy vows to make the world a better place and make men across the globe happy. We will later know him as Hugh Hefner.\n\n\nBut then, as Season 9 comes to a close and the screen fades, we hear the iconic laugh of none other than.... Ben Stiller. Netflix wants more money, so they decided that the best thing to do is to make Stranger Things a sitcom starring Ben and the rest of the Stranger Things cast.",

Disabling her would allow for increased tension.\n\n- It is mentioned in the Beyond Stranger Things episodes that the \"Mind Flayer\" is \"aware\" of her and her power now. Hence she is a target.\n\n- They want to include her \"sister\" more so if Eleven is hit then they can bring her in or the opposite and the \"Mind Flayer\" reaches out to Eight like the Demogorgon did in S1 and Eight succumbs.\n\n- They are going to need someone new to open a gate to the Upside down and my idea would be to have it be Eleven (with a minor chance of it being Eight or another sister).",

He's so clearly set up as the stereotypical jock human antagonist, but after realizing what douchebags his friends are he pulls a 180 and turns into probably the most badass character in the series. Felt like an actually unexpected spin on the largely \"stock\" 80s archetypes present in most of the rest of the series, and is part of what made it feel fresh. Nancy actually *doesn't* end up with the nerdy guy that crushes on her from a distance, she works things out with Steve who becomes a more complex character. I didn't like Nancy nearly as much in season 2 and they just decided \"Nah actually she does do exactly what you'd expect\" so she ends up with Jonathan, even though Steve never actually does anything wrong.",

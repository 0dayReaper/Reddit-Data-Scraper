He cuts his finger, the blood makes him pass out, he tries to iron his pants, it all escalates and escalates. There's almost no dialogue after the initial set-up. Just David Hyde Pierce doing physical comedy with a dog.\n\nThe reason it pops into my mind as funniest is because the first time it aired, my Dad was on the phone with someone. He was only halfway paying attention, but after a few minutes he was laughing so hard he had to stop his conversation and was trying to explain to the person on the phone what was happening. \n\nI don't know, it was just organic, sincere laughter about something that was genuinely funny, and it's always stuck with me.",

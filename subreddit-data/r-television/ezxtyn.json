Recently I've worked with smart designers and marketers, but I've had teams in the past that were always eager to ask me to make the dumbest, most obnoxious \"features\". I'd express I don't think it'll drive conversions as it's annoying/unintuitive/distracting, they'd tell me to do it anyway which takes weeks to build and test, and then we'd get such negative feedback it gets reverted within months.\n\nThere's something to be said for marketers that are willing to try new things. I can appreciate it, really. But so many of them are out of touch with good UX.\n\nThat problem is luckily getting better as the younger generation is filling a lot of those roles and they've spent their whole lives on computers and mobile devices so they're less likely to suggest dumb things. You still get older execs forcing bad ideas down the chain, though.",

I hated the jaring audio. The lame music. The spoilers. Just everything. Forcing it on us. I would mute the TV. It got to where now I browse Netflix so fast as to avoid them playing and it lost some of the specialness I have always upheld for Netflix. I've had it since like 2006 and have never canceled.

Most of the complaints I've seen about Netflix boil down to them losing all their good third-party content, which is exactly because there are eighty streaming services now.\n\n Recommendation system sucks now? It's because they don't have enough content for the old one to be viable anymore. Browsing sucks? It's to make their library feel bigger than it is. They push their originals too much on the front page? It's because that's increasingly all they've got.",

And I wanted to like it, but it's impossible.\n\n\"If the goal was to essentially erase Jocelyn\u2019s personality in the process, well, mission accomplished. Levinson, Tesfaye, and Fahim have scrubbed her POV from the pilot, opting for the male gaze in every shot.\"\n\n\"The problem is how she is written and filmed engaging with these pleasures\u2014like a cardboard cutout of male desire.\"\n\n\"It seems clear that The Idol is not really about Jocelyn, but the men who, like Pygmalion, shape her into an inanimate object of lust. The audience does not look through her eyes, but upon her with appetite.\"",

I've no idea from just one episode where the show will go and what will ultimately be the point. But if it's about her getting abused by others in her life, then that's a valid thing to explore as well.\n\nIt feels like the people are only insistent about the show being that bad because it's not about what THEY want it to be about. The showrunner has the right to explore whatever story he wants.",

Basically Sam Levinson has firmly established that he\u2019s a one-trick pony, and all of his usual \u201cbits\u201d are getting old quick. I\u2019m also a big fan of the Weeknd, but he has about as much charisma as a paper bag during Episode 1. Dialogue is crap. I surprised myself and almost turned it off 20 mins into the first episode. If this episode truly lays the groundwork for the rest of the series then I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be watching \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "comment": "In my opinion, this is the most provocative show HBO has put out to date, it\u2019s like something you\u2019d expect from Skinemax if they had \u201cgood\u201d writers, and that\u2019s not saying much at all about the quality of writing from The Idol. The parroted criticism of sexism is not the issue here in my opinion. A show can be extremely gratuitous and still compelling enough if the premise and character\u2019s inner struggle has the potential for a dynamic payoff. I don\u2019t see this happening.\n\n&gt;!Jocelyn has mommy issues, maybe issues with authority figures in general; she now has unadulterated freedom to discover herself even more now that her mother recently died (evident by the her sexually liberating song); she is insecure about her stardom\u2014like everything is so predictable and so unearned, she is already wealthy, she seems to be at the peak of her fame\u2014think about how much more compelling they could have written the story if they took a step back showing her relationship with her mother before she was rich and famous, struggling to make it in the industry. Where does the story go from here? Jocelyn gets fucked over, heart broken by The Weeknd, she learns to navigates the perils of fame\u2014as if the audience is stupid enough not to deduce that she already did so to reach the level she\u2019s at from the pilot\u2014she reaches catharsis by meeting someone unlike The Weeknd, like everything is so predictable.!&lt;\n\nStory arcs and character development issues notwithstanding, this show to me, feels more like a piece of propaganda for Lily-Rose Depp. She has been acting for years but this show is like \u201clook how good I can act, look how pretty I am\u201d as if the show is trying to prove something to the Tinseltown community. The sole purpose for this show existing is specially for the elevation of Lily-Rose Depp. I don\u2019t have any issue with her trying to be taken seriously and \u201cbreak out\u201d if she hadn\u2019t done so already, I just feel like none of the show matters, the character of Jocelyn, other characters, the portrayal of shadier side of music industry, the only thing that matters is Lily-Rose Depp and Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s performance. To say anything negative about this show is to take shots at Lily-Rose Depp, if any of this makes any sense. And speaking of her acting, contrary to some media reports, I do believe she does an amazing job acting. I just feel like this show is lackluster, soulless, the hyper-sexual visual overstimulation and Lily-Rose Depp aside.\n\n&gt; \"It seems clear that The Idol is not really about Jocelyn, but the men who, like Pygmalion, shape her into an inanimate object of lust. The audience does not look through her eyes, but upon her with appetite.\"\n\nThis quote does a very good job surmising the show. Jocelyn doesn\u2019t matter at all, the story does not matter, none of it matters, only our lust, our awed reaction to Lily-Rose Depp is all that matters. Maybe in a way, that\u2019s the whole point of it, being just how meta The Idol is to our celeb worship pop culture. But I don\u2019t want to give the showrunners too much credit because I mean, look how much effort went into the production value to make it overtly sexual as possible. Maybe this show could have been more widely accepted prior to the MeToo era. Celebrity worship has long lost its magic since then, further diminished by social media influencers, the lowest form of celebrity.\n\nI recommend this show if you love Lily-Rose Depp, or feel like watching porn but not really porn.",

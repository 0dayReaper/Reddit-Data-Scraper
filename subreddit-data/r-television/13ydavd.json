I would agree that travel &amp; lodging at a minimum should be covered (though could see some fine print). If you might want someone bad enough to make them to travel, pay (especially now that teleconferencing is ubiquitous). Also, if a company is asking you to travel but isn't willing to pay, you aren't high on their list (though in tv/film one could view that as a bet one makes in themselves...)\n\nIn terms of pay for the time, I'm on the fence in general, but more in favor for the film industry.  For traditional jobs, if you got paid for interviews I could see it leading to people who are essentially professional interviewees. At the same time I've heard how long the hiring process is becoming at some companies (4+ rounds) and that is ridiculous. \n\nIn terms of film though, I think it makes more sense as the jobs tend to be more short term with the best case being a few year run but the realities being it could get cancelled relatively quickly. You also have the abundance of people vying for limited work and that additional costs might prevent green-lighting of or reduce resources available to many pilots...",

Actors are even supposed to be paid for them.** SAG-AFTRA\u2019s contract with the studios states that **we\u2019re entitled to half our scale day rate for every audition we perform but don\u2019t book** for a TV show, studio feature, or high-budget indie. **Since our day rate is $1,082, that\u2019s $541. **\n\n\n&gt; How can a legal right feel so risky to talk about, even for people who agree that this payment is fair? **When I first learned about audition pay last fall, from a video by Sarah Ramos**, an emergency response team of arguments rushed through my head: **Auditions are job interviews. Casting directors will hate it. Producers can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019m just lucky to be following my dreams. That is, I viewed it from several perspectives except for that of a unionized laborer.** I learned that my work was already worth more than I thought it was, that I could\u2019ve made a thousand dollars that week alone, and my response was, \u201cI\u2019m good!\u201d \n\n&gt; **But the next time I spent hours making a self-tape, it seemed absurd that this commissioned performance should cost Netflix the same as a link to my reel.** I had recently watched actors\u2019 tapes with a screenwriter friend and was amazed by the countless, detailed artistic decisions of each performer. They saved my imagination a lot of work. Perhaps they would all, like me, say they were just lucky to be there. That didn\u2019t take away from the obvious value they created for the production. I realized how little I knew about auditions\u2019 value as not simply \u201copportunities\u201d for us, but commodities that studios need. \n\n\n\n* Guest Essay: Tavi Gevinson is an actor and a writer.

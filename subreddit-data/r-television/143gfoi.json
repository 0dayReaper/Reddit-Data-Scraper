The actions are a \u201cpretty powerful thing,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\n&gt; Indeed, network executives have conceded that the strategic picket lines have been \u201ceffective.\u201d\n\n\n&gt; If the picket lines remain suspended, it could give some productions (at least the ones that shoot indoors) time to continue shooting.",

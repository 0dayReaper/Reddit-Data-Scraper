I remember my sister calling each other from different states in the middle of the night to watch Conan together in hopes that he would beat his spin time. I mean, a spinning ring! It should be like watching paint dry, right? But he made it so exciting. You were right there along with him. Cheering him on. Like watching an Olympic event.",

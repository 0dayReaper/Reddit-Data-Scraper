It's like open season for supposedly 'professional' critics to pull out all their 90s era jokes about basement dwelling nerds and abandon all semblance of actually being a paid professional. It's so blatantly obvious when the critic is determined to hate the content right from the start.\n\nThe majority of these kinds of reviews are spent blabbing about how nerdy yet low-brow the material is - and making sure that we know they don't want to be associated with *them* - and very little actually spent critiquing the actual content. Everything is always compared back to the Lord of the Rings as if it's the metric by which every franchise with pointy eared things is measured by. This EW review is just as rote as the show they are panning. I'm genuinely amazed that they even managed to criticise the use of the word \"choice\" and somehow blame video games for it.\n\nAt least they spared us the forced injection of the outrage of the month. The Guardian is famously awful for this. Their 'review' of the Witcher consisted of a bunch of incel and internet jokes - because apparently 4Chan invented naked women? - and [never forget their Warcraft movie review that compared the Orcs to African migrants](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/world-of-warcraft-the-beginning-review-end-already-nigh) and suggested that the film was a UKIP/Brexit/Trump dog whistle.",

I was at her house on a number of occasions where she would put on a CD she received to review, listen to the first 10-30 seconds of a song, comment on it, skip to the next song, and repeat until the album was over. When it came time to write her review, she would listen to one or two songs in their entirety to have get some lyrics to quote, but that was it. That was her review process, and she would complain that she didn't have time to listen to the whole album. It pissed me off because an album runs usually about an hour, and you can listen to it while cleaning, driving, cooking dinner... It's not something you need to set time aside for.\n\nThis has always stuck with me and made me cautious about listening to reviewers.",

            "comment": "# Life is too short to open the links, so here's the review copy and pasted, don't give them clicks!!\n\n\nThe Witcher review: Netflix series starring Henry Cavill is terrible\new.com\n\nDarren Franich was planning to review the new Netflix series The Witcher by himself. Then he watched half an hour of the premiere and begged his critical colleague Kristen Baldwin to join his quest. The results were not pretty.\n\nKRISTEN: I don\u2019t know, should we start with the wig? The two most important things Hollywood learned from the Lord of the Rings films are as follows: 1) It is possible to make an entire movie franchise about people walking, and 2) If you cast a hunk as a gentle-hearted fantasy-realm hero, make sure to put him in a white-blonde wig that looks like it was snatched straight from the head of Jennifer Elise Cox in The Brady Bunch Movie. And so poor, beefy Henry Cavill \u2014 who stars as Geralt of Rivia, the titular Witcher \u2014 finds himself saddled with a flowing, distracting mane of flaxen locks.\n\nHis hair is definitely the brightest thing about The Witcher\u2019s first episode, which takes place in the dreary, muddy, soot-colored town of Blaviken. It\u2019s a place where people don\u2019t cotton to Witchers, at least if the grimy, bearded man Geralt encounters in the pub is to be believed. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your kind around here, Witcher,\u201d he growls. Rude. Anyhow, the pilot also features two rough-and-tumble princesses (Freya Allan, Emma Appleton), a wizard (Lars Mikkelsen), and totally gratuitous full-frontal female nudity. There are seven naked women in the first episode alone, Darren. Seven! I\u2026 think I\u2019ve seen enough?\n\nDARREN: Kristen, I have a confession. I am a member of the Henry Cavill Appreciation Society. The big Super-Brit was a deadpan delight in the goofball spyfest The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and a brilliantly looming tower in the most recent Mission: Impossible. Why, oh why, oh why he opted to star in a series that buries him under a bad wig and worse color contacts is a mystery to me.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s a failure of franchise-chasing. The Witcher comes from novels by Andrzej Sapkowski, which also inspired an acclaimed video game series. I haven\u2019t played the games, but the pilot has certain tropes from that medium exported without imagination to television. There\u2019s the constant download of fantasy verbiage, including much talk about a \u201ckikimora\u201d and a town I swear is called \u201cBlevicum.\u201d Mikkelsen\u2019s character has a big line about how Geralt \u201cmade a choice,\u201d which feels like a hat-tip to the open-world nature of the games. The intention here is dark pulp fantasy, so this is the kind of show where a character like Appleton\u2019s Renfri is a Princess and a mutant who has sex with Geralt the night before they battle to the death.\n\nI\u2019m definitely not averse to the wild extremes of this genre \u2014 shout-out to the visceral blood terrors of Adult Swim\u2019s Primal \u2014 but the first episode felt like cheese gone moldy. That nude bordello really edged the whole vibe in a fratty direction, and the long running time required a lot of take-forever talk about prophecies and destiny. Did you watch further into the season?\n\nKRISTEN: In the interest of professional obligation, Darren, I did sit through the second episode, which was notable for a few reasons. (Spoiler: None of those reasons include, \u201cBecause it was good.\u201d) Henry Cavill gets far less screen time in the second hour \u2014 and he has to share his few scenes with a very, very annoying traveling bard (I would name the actor who plays him, but I\u2019m fairly certain the writers didn\u2019t even bother to name the character?). Anyhow, this very annoying traveling singer makes up tunes about abortion and says things like, \u201cThere I go again, just delivering exposition.\u201d\n\nMost of the second episode is devoted to the travails of a deformed young woman named Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), whose jerk of a father sells her off to a haughty witch named Tissaia de Vries (MyAnna Buring). It turns out Yennifer has some untapped magical abilities, and she finds herself enrolled in Tissaia\u2019s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or whatever she calls it. So now this show is The Magicians featuring special guest star Henry Cavill, I guess?\n\nThe Witcher is also packed with confusing conflicts and long-held rivalries that require a lot of explanation but still manage to make no sense. The premiere sets up a princess-wizard showdown that is related to a curse (I think), while episode 2 introduces a budding war between Elves and humans. Apparently the Elves taught the humans how to turn something called \u201cchaos\u201d into magic, and then the humans unleashed a genocide on them. \u201cI was once Filavandrel of the Silver Towers,\u201d notes a majestic Elf (Tom Canton). \u201cNow I\u2019m Filavandrel of the edge of the world.\u201d So yeah, this is some high-school level Dungeons &amp; Dragons role play with a multi-million-dollar budget. Netflix canceled the far cheaper, far more entertaining The Good Cop for this?\n\nDARREN: Because life\u2019s too short for Netflix drama running times, I skipped ahead to the fifth episode, which brings the Yennefer and Geralt plotlines together. Episode 5 also features Magic Viagra and a masked orgy set to some truly ridiculous retro-softcore music. I do think there\u2019s room for a mature-content fantasy romp in our post-Game of Thrones universe, but eternal exposition runs alongside a tin ear for dialogue.\n\nThis is the first TV show I\u2019ve ever seen that would actually be better with commercial breaks. The goofy syndicated fantasy of yesteryear had to have a brisk pace, building every 12 minutes to an act-breaking cliffhanger. The Witcher fully embraces the endless-movie layout of the worst Blank Check streaming TV. At the end of the series premiere, someone tells Allen\u2019s Princess Ciri that Geralt is her destiny. In episode 5, people are still telling her that Geralt is her destiny. I assume they will meet in the season finale. Alas, my destiny is to never watch this borefest ever again.

Hollywood is a ridiculously competitive space. If you are working on anything then you are already beating the amazing odds that are stacked against you. Most actors don\u2019t just have roles fall into their lap. To me it\u2019s almost as pitiful when people make fun of someone for having a fast food job. At least they\u2019re working, yeah? But besides all of that the review is already crazy unprofessional and that criticism of work only adds to it.",

It's fine if he didn't like the show, but he's literally not doing the job he's being paid for which is articulating *why* he didn't like the show and contextualizing its faults and fart fart fart.  Y'know, criticism.\n\nRoger Ebert was a fantastic critic and an insightful writer.  That said, he also gave bad reviews to movies like Rushmore, Blade Runner, Blue Velvet, and Die Hard.  \n\nI sure fucking disagreed with all of those reviews, and the reason I could agree or disagree was that he actually articulated his reasoning because he watched the fucking movies.  I can't even disagree with this EW review because the dude may as well have said \"didn't watch, still bad lol 0 stars.\"",

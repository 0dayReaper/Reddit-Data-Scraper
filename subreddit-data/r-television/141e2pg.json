Transportation, getting it into the house (disassemble/reassemble, knock out a wall, build a room around it), and taking up the square footage in a house that this thing represents all add significant cost.  There are a lot of rich people who can do it, but it's a smaller market than the rich people who can afford a comic, rare car, etc.",

Or a couple of moderately successful friends could have pooled their money to buy it.\n\nI guess I just figured that billionaires who grew up with the show would bid it well into a 7-figure sum.\n\nI see that the cash register sold for $40k, so I guess they were really splitting up the items as much as they could. If that was separate, yet is in the picture for this article, are other parts separate as well?\n\nAlso, my first thought was to turn it into a real bar, but I suppose that would ruin it, and it would probably need to be heavily modified.\n\nStill a piece of history though.

It\u2019s just \u201cwatch Becky be a doormat and watch Sam wither\u201d. \n\nAnd how do they cap off an 11 year run? Diane inexplicably returns, they fly off to get married in what is *clearly* a desperation play by both characters bc they\u2019re in their 40s, single, both have fucked up their lives and this is their \u201cnew start\u201d. \n\nTimrobinsonWHATTHEFUCK.gif",

Coach dies between season 3 and 4. Woody was there for 2 seasons of Diane. Lilith doesn't appear until season 4 and even that was just a one-off. She doesn't get together with Frasier until she comes back in Diane's last season. Also, when did Woody ever have a crush on Diane? Diane was like an big sister to him.\n\nYes Woody and Lilith were there during Diane's time but they were given a lot more material after she left. I'm a bigger fan of Diane than Rebecca but the Rebecca years allowed the show to grow and gave the other characters a chance to shine. If Diane had stayed on, they probably would've got cancelled cause you can only do Sam/Diane for so many years before people are done with it",

If one town or city had a famous bar with a picture of a bull and a finch over the doorway, someone else would use a similar sign, and over hundreds of years such a combination would just be associated with bars and public houses in general.",

Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.\n\nIn this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.

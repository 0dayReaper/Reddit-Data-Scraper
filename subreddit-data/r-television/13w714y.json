The MLB has made it as clear as possible, while not actually saying it, that they want Bally out of baseball entirely so they have total control of broadcast rights in the same way the NFL does.\n\nProbably only reason MLB didn\u2019t outright buy out their contracts is they got wind that the organization was much more unstable then they represented and figured why pay for something that they can get for free by simply waiting.",

ESPN/ABC gave them a laughably low number in the lockout year, so they cobbled together a broadcast deal with NBC and a cable deal with Comcast (who agreed they'd start a big push on a national cable network).  The OLN stuff was always supposed to be temporary, until the network was rebranded to Versus (and, coincidentally, picked up a few other ESPN cast-offs like IndyCar and MLS).  Then Comcast bought NBC, turned Versus into NBCSN, and ran itself into the ground.",

They've been trying to buy up local sports broadcast and licensing them out to local broadcast channels (I think with an eye of streaming as well) as much as I am not rooting for the death of regional sports cable channels because I like the specific coverage of my local teams, with the fluidity of streaming rights I would love if my local sports teams broadcast rights went to a local channel I could pick up on an HD antenna regardless of what cable plan or streaming I have.",

    "postText": "I am about halfway through Bill Nye Saves the World, and I am completely disappointed. I've been a huge fan of Bill Bye since I was ten. Bill Nye the Science Guy was entertaining and educational. Bill Nye Saves the World is neither. In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side. To make things worse he does this in the most boring way possible in front of crowd that honestly seems retarded. He doesn't properly explain anything, and he misrepresents every opposing view.\n\nI just finished watching the fad diet episode. He presents Paleo as \"only eating meat\" which is not even close to what Paleo is. Paleo is about eating nutrient rich food, and avoiding processed food, grains and sugar. It is protein heavy, but is definitely not all protein. He laughs that cavemen died young, but forgets to mention that they had very low markers of cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because \"nobody wants it.\" Really? That's his go to argument? There was no discussion about handling nuclear waste, or the nuclear disaster in Japan. A panelist states that the main problem with nuclear energy is the long time it takes to build a nuclear plant (because of all the red tape). So we have a major issue (climate change caused by burning hydrocarbons), and a potential solution (nuclear energy), but we are going to dismiss it because people don't want it and because of the policies in place by our government. Meanwhile, any problems with clean energy are simply challenges that need to be addressed, and we need to change policy to help support clean energy and we need to change public opinion on it.\n\nIn the alternative medicine episode he dismisses a vinegar based alternative medicine because it doesn't reduce the acidity level of a solution. He dismiss the fact that vinegar has been used to treat upset stomach for a long time. How does vinegar treat an upset stomach? Does it actually work, or is it a placebo affect? Does it work in some cases, and not in others? If it does anything, does it just treat a symptom, or does it fix the root cause? I don't know the answer to any of these questions because he just dismissed it as wrong and only showed me that it doesn't change the pH level of an acidic solution. Also, there are many foods that are believed to help prevent diseases like fish (for heart health), high fiber breads (for colon cancer), and citrus fruits (for scurvy). A healthy diet and exercise will help prevent cardiovascular disease, and will help reduce your blood pressure among other benefits. So obviously there is some reasoning behind some alternative medicine and practices and to dismiss it all as a whole is stupid.\n\nI just don't see the point of this show. It's just a big circle jerk. It's not going to convince anyone that they're wrong, and it's definitely not going to entertain anyone. It's basically just a very poor copy of Penn and Teller's BS! show, just with all intelligent thought removed.",

Not saying crystal healing isn't complete nonsense, but Bill brought him in the show to debate, so let him speak and don't make fun of him, Bill.",

A lot of people from my generation love Bill because of watching his show as children, and we heap tons of adoration on him because of that. I mean who the hell didn't love Bill growing up. So he spends the last 10-15 years hearing how great he is and starts to think to himself, \"Damn I'm Bill Nye. Everyone loves me. I must be as smart and cool as everyone is saying. Let me teach these dumb assholes how to be like me\". And then he makes a show that does exactly that.\n\n\nIn a way we're partly to blame for placing a guy with one degree on a pedestal. Humble Bill made entertaining and educational content for kids. Celebrity Bill just bitches at people who don't think like him without the real scientific insight to back himself up.",

There was no science, Bill was pulling some awkward as fuck /r/fellowkids lines, and the closest thing to credible information was coming from the nude/fashion model. I gave it a chance with a whole episode and called it quits.\n\nThen someone sent me an image of the episode with the sex junk song. It was just a vertical image macro with screens and captions. I thought the show was so bad someone was just parodying it to make it look even worse. My thought was that whoever was trying to poke fun at the show was trying way too hard to the point it wasn't even funny.\n\nNope. It was all actual quotes from the show. I watched half the song on Youtube and died. I am ded.",

            "comment": "It's the ultimate outcome (well, at least a local maximum) of a trend that has been continuing for a long time now.\n\nCompare the new *Cosmos*. A ton of people loved the new *Cosmos*, but it has a lot of the same problems with slightly better production. The discussion of scientific history (especially Neil deGrasse Tyson's beloved Bruno) is profoundly misleading where it isn't outright false. Things are simplified and controversy and nuance are downplayed.\n\nThere are good, interesting segments in *Cosmos*, but it is shot through with this very strong ideological bent where \"science\" is this essentialized, ahistorical object and the only problem is all of these ideological enemies who need to be overcome.\n\nIt's \"science\" as a religious or political affiliation rather than what it actually is - a collection of investigatory practices that are pretty diverse and *really* complicated and nuanced.\n\nSpeaking as someone who has actually worked as a scientist, I find this very, very troubling. This is not what science or scientists are actually like.\n\nMost celebrity scientists aren't really scientists - either they never were (like Nye) or they've done far more as celebrities than as scientists (Tyson). Those few celebrity scientists who are still working scientists in a meaningful sense, with very few exceptions, have a similar problem: they present their pet theories as established facts or consensus views, regardless of the evidence, regardless of the agreement of the field, with very little nuance (Steven Pinker is a good example of someone especially bad about this).\n\nIt's good that we have attempts to educate people about the basics of scientific investigation, about concepts like control (though it would be nice if a little more time was spent on explaining that control is *relative* rather than binary). It's good that we're discussion things that *are* overwhelming consensus views like global warming, MMR vaccines, etc. Honestly, those are so important that if we can get people to believe them dogmatically - who cares. Things need to get done.\n\nBut so, so much airtime in recent years has gone toward a Cult of Science. You have non-scientists demonstrating with signs that say \"I believe in science!\". What does that even mean?\n\nIt seems to me that it means that Neil deGrasse Tyson is your televangelist. It seems like it's about a condescending attitude toward non-believers (who in turn become more hostile to *actual* science). It means Bill Nye debates Ken Ham and people on his side tune in for exactly the same reason Ham's people tune in - they don't want to learn anything, they want to watch Nye smugly prove what an idiot Ham is, and by extension all the rubes that believe the same things (at no point does Nye actually try to confront Ham on Ham's terms - he just barrels forward because the goal isn't to convert Ham, it's to preach to the choir).\n\nAdherents talk about \"the scientific method\" like it's communion, absolving researchers of sins and yielding truth through a simple pre-written ritual. Kuhn is an apostate - a needless liberal arts nitpicker who doesn't understand the power of the true scientific method (nevermind that actual working scientists use a huge variety of methods, many of them quite different from the rigid \"scientific method\" you were taught in fifth grade). But nevermind that: Saint Popper and the blessed Falsificationism solved science, and any actual scientists and philosophers of science who seem critical are heretics.\n\nPeer review functions as a similar article of faith, nevermind that every single measure shows that it doesn't work very well (as anyone who has ever been on either side of it could probably tell you).\n\nThen you have your distorted version of history (like you see in *Cosmos*) where you were right in every way from the start and have merely been suppressed and victimized by all the people who simply Hate Good Things as a matter of principle.\n\nYou have the weird beliefs that took on a life of their own. Mary Magdalene was a prostitute and the Stanford Prison Experiment demonstrated how easily positions of authority cause people to behave inhumanely. You see it get brought up all the time. Except what you may not know is that, among scientists, it is almost universally used as an example of *what not to do* - and not just that it was unethical: the results are completely meaningless thanks to a laundry list of basic problems that you could (and psychology professors often do) teach a class on.\n\nAnd then you have your iconography: pictures of spaces, pictures from microscopes, pictures of lab equipment, test tube shot glasses, posters with \"science jokes\", \"science nerd\" t-shirts. Look at how popular *The Big Bang Theory* is.\n\nBill Nye's new show is just the most recent extreme. He's the Milo Yiannopoulos to Neil deGrasse Tyson's Sean Hannity. It's been coming for a while, and it speaks to how common the ideology has gotten that it takes something this extreme for people to notice.",

Bill just cut him off (when he was actually the one I wanted to hear from the most) and continued with his agenda, Nancy Grace-style.  I started the second episode, hoping the trainwreck I just watched was just because he was very dedicated to the climate change thing, and I couldn't even finish it.  The way he frames each segment; the way he talks to the audience of grown adults; the way he completely pulls the rug out from anything he disagrees with... it's exactly what I hate about *science-deniers* coming from a beloved childhood science icon.\n\nIt's like he doesn't trust concerned adults (who want to actually learn more) with having adult attention spans, so he rubs glitter on everything and waves Steve Aoki in front of the audience.  It's actually offensive to people like myself, who want to obtain new information without being talked down to.",

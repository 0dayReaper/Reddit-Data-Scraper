    "postText": "I love shows like The Twilight Zone, Black Mirror, Love, Death + Robots, or movies like Mother. But I don't care to think about deeper meanings or messages in the stories.\n\nFor me it's just \"haha weird things happening, how interesting and fun.\", And I don't spend a single second wondering what was the message or subtext meaning of it.\n\nWhat do you think about this? Do you like to unravel the layers of a story? Do you think I'm dumb for enjoying them only from a superficial level?\n\nI'd love the know your pov on that and what shows and movies do you like that have those \"deeper layers\"",

So that's a excellent example, I loved the jokes, the unusual situations that the characters are put in and how they deal with them. Now I overheard people saying that the show has some deeper message about something, but I like it for the bizarre and absurdity of the situations, and don't have the patience to reflect about anymore else.",

There is a reason we are attracted to certain aesthetics, or repelled by others. \n\nNot everyone takes a critical approach to media, and in truth, most internet criticism isn\u2019t actually very critical\u2014a lot of it just \u2018show/movie broke X rule, therefore it is good/bad.\u2019 But I imagine that you do make value judgements about media; presumably you like certain things over other things, even if you don\u2019t care to rhapsodize about it. \n\nMy point is that even if you\u2019re not taking it to as conscious, critical level, your values (which are not necessarily limited to moral values, to be clear) are still engaging with a show\u2019s values when you watch it. Symbolism is how the brain works; your notions of womanhood, for example, will inform your emotional response to a movie like mother!, regardless of whether you\u2019re inclined to pick at womanhood as a concept.",

I very much enjoyed Mother purely for the bizarre and absurd situations, loved the aesthetic of the film.\n\nWhen I see those absurd scenarios, I often imagine how I would deal with the situations the characters are in, and that's what is interesting for me.\n\nWhat I can't follow is when people start saying things like \"oh actually that episode was about how [something] is damaging our society\"",

                            "comment": "it sounds like you don't really like to engage with art on the level of symbolism, at least not in a super active way.\n\nit's important to remember that while interpretations can often feel laden with value judgments (\"you didn't get it, it's about..\"), any interpretation comes from what a viewer brings to the film (personality, personal history, knowledge, taste, current mood/mental state) and what they take away (including what they prioritize/may value or devalue disproportionately in the text). don't get trapped in the idea that interpretation is limited (outside of things that can be justified on some level, of course) or limiting! any interpretation is accessible to you if you can understand the justification behind it, even if it's not compelling or productive for you. you don't have to feel pressure to \"understand the true meaning of a film\" on your first viewing.\n\nmother! is such a fascinating example here because I feel that the film has a clear and almost unintentionally comic intention to operate on a symbolic level. the couple are unmoored from the world and have no relation to anything but an abstract concept of the greater world and each other - they act almost like greek gods, who are themselves avatars/symbols of abstract concepts. I found mother! a bit blunt and found it somewhat hard to find the drama meaningful because the characters were so purely symbolic. but I can see how those same characteristics would make a fascinating watch on a more literal level.\n\neven on a purely narrative level I feel like it's easy to make a pretty strong case that mother! functions effectively as a film about vulnerability/power. that reading coexists and interacts with the biblical/history of humanity reading fairly easily and in interesting ways. I have a friend who viewed the film through the lens of relationship abuse, and its also easy to see that angle and how it interacts with the more base vulnerability/power dynamic. I think these are all valid and interesting ways to view the film, but the film just doesn't really hit me on an emotional level because of its approach to character.\n\ninteresting how it was shot on 16mm too... a fascinating artistic choice that really colors the film. but it also could be seen as literally privileging symbolism over clarity.",

            "comment": "I read the comments and I think your taste for wondering what you would do over looking into symbolism is cool. On a personal level it\u2019s fine enjoying things that way, and you seem chill about it. I wish more people had philosophical insight but it is how it is. There isn\u2019t an arbitrary line between people for their tastes on that, though it can get in the way of discussions for me and has left me feeling lonely.\n\nI absolutely have a compulsion to look into symbolism and what in my life is reflected by art, so I usually don\u2019t hold interest in less symbolic or personal discussions. When people just say x or y is cool because of the spectacle I get very bored; though if someone has other theories or ideas, I still might have some interest in listening. Still, t\u2019s a shame if I can\u2019t share my own line of thought and get something in response.\n\nAnyway, you\u2019re fine. For what it\u2019s worth on the other end, it can be difficult to find people who are also interested in some level of symbolism/philosophy who aren\u2019t pretentious about it (by which I mean: focused primarily on something being \u201cdeep\u201d as an indicator of quality). Ultimately I think the first thing to good discussion is a level of self-awareness to what your personal taste vs objective takes are, generally not being toxic/close-minded (not in terms of depth in analysis, but judging people for liking/disliking something), etc.",

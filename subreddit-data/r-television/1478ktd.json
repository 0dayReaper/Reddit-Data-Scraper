    "postText": "I don\u2019t really get the hate Velma gets. Velma is at the bottom of the IMBD rankings which is weird, because it\u2019s just as good/bad as so many adult animated comedies.\n\nThe main complains about it is that it\u2019s a bastardization of the Scooby Doo Franchise, it sexualizes teenagers, and it\u2019s not funny. \n\n1. Bastardization\n\nScooby Doo is notorious for its spin offs. There is even a new show where the whole point is Scoob meeting some new celebrity each week. There has been some pretty soulless cross overs like the Courage the Cowardly Dog cross over Straight Out of Nowhere. Compared to a lot of other Scooby Doo spin-offs, Velma is way higher in quality. There\u2019s a lot of fun nods to the original show. They\u2019re not super in your face, but they do show appreciation for the source material. \n\n2. Sexualization of Teenagers\n\nThe opening scene to Velma is a lot and turns a lot of people off to the show. But, there are tons of other shows, both live action and animated, that do the same thing. So this criticism never really sat right with me. I guess people get extra uncomfortable because they\u2019re Scooby Doo characters? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s nothing worse than every other anime.\n\n3. It\u2019s not funny.\n\nThis one boils down to personal opinion. I found myself laughing at a lot of gags throughout the series. I found the way they characterized the main cast hilarious. There are some cringe moments, yes. But there\u2019s enough comedy that you should find something that makes you laugh. \n\nThe first two episodes are easily the worst. I wouldn\u2019t fault anyone for not enjoying those. But I\u2019d one or two episodes passed that and see if any sparks joy.",

            "comment": "I watched the first few episodes and thought it was horrible. \n\nI don't have a problem with different takes on characters, but you have to keep the essence of the character. Velma being an extremely mean spirited \"not-like-the-other-girls\" is an entirely left field take on the character. \n\nAnd it is like that with all the characters. They don't seem like a parody of the Scooby-Doo doo characters. Fred has never been an idiot that doesn't know how to do basic stuff. It just doesn't land. \n\nI also hate the Velma nightmare scenarios. They are vidually enjoyable, but they are a completely separate tone from the rest of the show. Also, if anyone in the Scooby-Doo gang suffers from horrible terrors....it seems like it would be Shaggy.\n\nThe tone is another problem. The basic premise is there is a serial killer killing people. Serious stuff. Dead bodies. But then you have Velma randomly walking Daphne with a steel pipe for literally no reason, or people getting their legs chopped off in the school hallway, and no one bats an eye or even responds to those incidents. It just feels weird.",

            "comment": "Ultimately I think people grasp for rational reasons to hate something their having a strong emotional reaction to.  The hate preceded the actual show being out for a reason. We saw this with Dear White People (imo a good show) when fans reacted to the tone and subject matter when the show wasn't even out.  That being said the \"insert self\" main character, no scooby, shitting on the fans in the trailer, nostalgia baiting, race swapping then emasculating Fred, all seemed like key reasons for its hate.  On top of that the quality didn't seem to be there but that is very subjective. \n\nEnd of the day I'm not sure who the show it made for.  The tumbler equivalent of edgelord might enjoy it but really not sure who else.  It tries to deconstruct traditional scooby doo while not really having any heart itself, just commentary and snarky jokes.\n\n&gt;Bastardization &amp; &gt;Sexualization of Teenagers \n\nI mean there being no Scooby isn't even bastardization, its just cutting out the heart of the show and isn't comparable to cross overs.  Personally never saw the sexualization criticism, at least not on here.  \n\n&gt;It\u2019s not funny. \n\nIs personal opinion but beyond that I feel people are tired of cynical deconstruction of classical themes/shows.  Its cheap and easy to poke fun at tropes while acting better than the material.",

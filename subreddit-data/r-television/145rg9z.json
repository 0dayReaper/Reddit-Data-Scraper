            "comment": "I said it before but I feel like CW is trying to become the \"Hallmark\" Channel of sorts.\n\nNot necessarily rom-coms or Christmas special, but those shows you hear or see play in background... in the hospitals or waiting rooms.\n\nAlways with a broken farmer meets young, brash professional city girl and blah, blah.\n\nOr woman detective show where she solves super non-violent crimes in here beautiful, clean small town. Where everyone knows her name and she knows them. \n\nIt might have one african american, latino, or native american sheriff or lawyer. A latino woman as the DA, most likely. And she always crying to her older sister(who has a family) that she got a call from her high school crush.\n\nCan't forget the 4-5 hour marathon of The Waltons through the mid-day. Follow by your religious-like shows, like Highway to Heaven or Our House. \n\nWeekends might be sports like golf or indy cars racing or something boring.\n\nLate nights is mostly info-commercials of vacuums and blenders.\n\nAnd that's the new CW.",

He's an actual character with his own motivations, he has his fair share of actually badass moments. Not to mention when they make a joke specifically referencing Indian culture, sure it's stereotypical, but they always feel like a charming shout out. They don't go out of their way to ignore the culture like nearly every other depiction of Indians in American television.",

            "comment": "This entire thing lands squarely on Adi Shankar's lap, in my opinion. Not Kondabolu's.\n\nSo Hari Kondabolu does his *The Problem with Apu,* which is quite a bit more involved than \"Apu is racist, write him off!\" But The Simpsons *do* respond\u2014they write an entire episode, *No Good Read Goes Unpunished* in April 2018. The Simpsons team then mostly disengages, since they've put their response on the record and anything else is just beating a dead horse. Mike Reiss, the only original writer for the show left, notes that, *No Good Read* aside, Apu has had barely any lines for three seasons, in any case. In other words, he's close to being a non-character in the modern show.\n\nAdi Shankar begins advertising his script contest around the same time as the Simpsons response\u2014April 2018. Shankar chooses the script, submits it to the Simpsons team, the Simpsons team goes \"thanks but no thanks\" (they had already done a response episode, after all). \n\nShankar then proceeds to start banging pots up and down the halls in October 2018 and screaming that he's heard from \"confirmed sources,\" that they're going to write Apu off entirely. Shankar has no connection to the Simpsons\u2014a lot of clickbait sites at the time directly called him a \"Simpsons producer,\" for the record. He begins announcing that the Simpsons team didn't pick up his contest's \"perfect script,\" ultimately because they were cowards who wanted to avoid the matter rather than address it with his script. (Again, as far as The Simpsons team was concerned, they had already addressed it.)\n\nWhether this was just fabrication on Shankar's part, or a misinterpretation of the team's response to his script, or whether the team really *did* say \"we're mulling just getting rid of Apu,\" it's hard to say. But, for obvious reasons, Shankar is not a reliable source on this and has his own reasons for drumming up media outrage.\n\nIt should be noted in passing that *Kondabolu himself* expressed regret at the rumor that Apu was getting written off\u2014Kondabolu never aimed at getting Apu written off, he was simply talking about his experience as a South Asian man growing up in a society where a lot of people's only real reference point for South Asians was an at times questionable caricature, and the effect of that on his life and experience.\n\nNow, here's the rub: beside Castlevania, Adi Shankar also runs a YouTube series called Bootleg Universe, which makes satirical \"copies\" of films and series. Castlevania is part of a larger \"Bootleg Multiverse,\" and hence the source of most of his fame and pull. While Shankar was banging his pots, he *also* implied that if the Simpsons team was too cowardly to produce his \"perfect script,\" he would make the episode himself on *Bootleg Universe.* The original spec contest, by the way, was done on the Bootleg Universe website.\n\nA full quote from Shankar on this: \n\n&gt;If you are a show about cultural commentary and you are too afraid to comment on the culture, especially when it\u2019s a component of the culture you had a hand in creating, then you are a show about cowardice. It\u2019s not a step forward, or step backwards, it\u2019s just a massive step sideways. After having read all these wonderful scripts, I feel like sidestepping this issue doesn\u2019t solve it when the whole purpose of art, I would argue, is to bring us together.\n\nExcept, of course, The Simpsons *didn't* sidestep the issue and they *weren't* too afraid to comment on it\u2014they made an *entire episode* about it and then (quite wisely) decided not to beat a dead horse. \n\nIt also, of course, plays in your favor if you're drumming up media attention for your favored script by accusing The Simpsons of quietly writing off a character that had *already had almost no lines for the last three seasons.* That way, if the show returns to the status quo after their one-off response to Kondabolu, it looks like Shankar has been proven right. To prove Shankar wrong, you'd need a more active role for Apu in the near future\u2014and, of course, Shankar just happens to have the script for that, and is saying to everyone who will listen that the Simpsons team are cowards for not using it.\n\nThis entire thing is a trail of outrage stoked by Shankar to try and either twist the arm of the Simpsons team into taking his script or alternatively drum up interest for Shankar's own Bootleg Universe Simpsons episode. It was the media equivalent of going \"are you chicken?! Bawk bawk bawk!\"",

It's more about the Indian-American experience and how representation can be such a defining experience for ethnic minorities than it is about \"canceling\" Apu.  Whether you agree with the arguments made or not, the point was to start a conversation that I personally feel is worth having.  It's honestly not at all controversial.  Hell, it's more about Apu's historical legacy than anything contemporary.  The fact that The Simpsons is still on is kind of beside the point.\n\nBut then media talking heads open articles with headlines like \"Should Apu be written off The Simpsons?  This documentary says yes!\" and then before you know it, a bunch of know-nothings chime in and poison the well and the actual topic of conversation is completely drowned out.",

So they absolutely love characters like Apu, just like how as a kid I loved 'Achmed the Dead Terrorist,' because we were looking for anything that would reflect our lives. It's only later on that we take  a moment and stop and think 'Wait a second, none of these characters are voiced or portrayed by actual Indians. And when they do, they do all the shit I was bullied for as a kid.' \n\nThere's a kind of grief with the realization that the guy in the turban is just a white dude with face paint on.

It gives a great insight to how the show got awful.\n\nBasically everyone on the show figured it was going to end around season 9-10 and started getting experimental and making Homer more of a jerkass/loud, and they sort of stuck with it when they didn't get cancelled. Fox also took an interest in making the show their flagship series (this was after almost cancelling the show, which is why they picked up Family Guy as its replacement), and started cutting back on animation and being notoriously cheap (refusing to give voice actor Maggie Roswell a raise since she was flying from Colorado to LA four times a week).\n\nThe Scully-era episodes have their moments no matter how wacky they are, but the current episodes are BAD. Like stale, elevator music bad. All the jokes are explained, the characters explain to the audience what they're doing and how they feel, and jokes are run into the ground and beat to death (look at the Canada episode last season, we get a full minute of \"Newfies are dumb, right????\" which turns into a song that nobody asked for). \n\nFor a show that used to satirize society, it's become a soulless, creepily animated, shill of its former self.",

It starts off with Lisa talking about how great Canada is, then someone comes out of nowhere (a Zombie Simpsons trademark) and says Quebec is dumb, then a bunch of kids comes out of nowhere (2 for 2) and say Newfies are dumb, then a Newfie Ralph Wiggum comes out of nowhere (3 for 3) literally goes \"I'm a Newfie\" and kicks around a baby seal head while singing a shitty song about being a Newfie. Great writing!\n\nThe same guy who wrote the episode also wrote the Lady Gaga episode, so I'm not sure why he's still employed by the show. Maybe he has something on Groening.",

I had thought there was more, but I think this at least explains why they had to refocus the show onto Homer.  There's a very noticeable tone shift from Season one to two.  To be honest, I find the season one episodes almost unwatchable now:\n\nOn Metacritic, a site which uses a weighted mean score, the season scored a 79/100 from six critics, translating to \"generally favorable reviews.\" However, the show was controversial from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents to characterize him as a poor role model for children.[32][33] Several US public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption \"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\".[34] Despite the ban, The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated US$2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales",

Once in awhile they'll have one episode that's really good, but you have to sit through a bunch of boring ones to reach it.\n\nIt's the same issue you have with any long standing series. Comic books and serialized novels have the same issue. Once a pattern of story telling and character portrayal is established, and the original creators drop out, then the people carrying on the series tend to be using a check list of archetypes and tropes that they associate with the series.  As a result anyone who has actually been a fan from the beginning sees a huge dissonance between the quality of the originals under the creators and the fans-of-the-creators who took over in later years.",

I haven't watched the video on Apu that really launched this whole thing but I'll just compare this character to John Redcorn who is played by Jonathan Joss who is a Native American. \n\nIf you tried to talk about John Redcorn being a bad-taste stereotype, you'd have Jonathon there for his take, and he'd probably say anything taken that way is a joke, or talk about Redcorn's positive sides. Hank Azaria isn't in that same position.\n\nedit, I found Jonathon defending redcorn, case in point \n\n&gt;He has his own business. Native characters and guest characters in general aren't allowed to arc like that. People have hit me over the head, saying I was that character sleeping with the white lady and having a kid I don't care about; but I tell him you didn't see King of the Hill after the first few seasons. Redcorn changed.\n\nhttps://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/jonathan-joss-talks-parks-and-rec-king-of-the-hill-and-his-nama-nomination-36RRq4aGOU6RblLLI0aPsQ/",

Chief Wiggum, for instance, may be an incompetent cop who tends to make things far worse than they were, but he's a genuinely good and loving father to Ralph and might be the best parent on the show.",

I'm not really offended by these facts by the way, I fully get that the 90's were a different time, but it did suck growing up in the late 90's and early 00's having to hear the \"thank you, come again\" line yelled at me every time someone wanted to make fun of me and eventually realizing my childhood's defining stereotype until that Big Bang Theory character was created by people who don't look like me and who didn't understand my experience.\n\nThe actual offensive part to me was Matt Groening complaining about PC culture trying to take down Apu which was very much NOT what anybody was complaining about.\n\nI also want to make it clear that there are Indian people who are gonna agree and disagree with my viewpoint and that's fine, I just thought it would help to hear one different view on the situation.",

There is a lot of mixed feelings, which led to a documentary that was pretty critical of Apu being voiced by a white voice actor doing stereotypical material. Maybe it was acceptable 30 years ago, but is it acceptable now? \n\nI say yes, it's fine. I certainly view Apu as an admirable character and a great representative of a culture I learned about at least in part through him when I was young. That said, I'm not South Asian. I do subscribe to the idea that I don't get to tell someone something is or isn't racist, is or isn't offensive. If someone says they are upset, I believe them. Now we come to the crux of the matter: Do we write out a popular character because of this issue? If we do, does that also impact the syndicated episodes? The Simpsons showrunners have made their call. I agree with them, but I respect that some people are going to be unhappy about it.",

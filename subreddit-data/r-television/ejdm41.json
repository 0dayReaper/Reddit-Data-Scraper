She had a bag that took anything she ate or drank out of her system immediately because it caused her too much pain to actually eat or drink something. So she couldn't possibly get any nutrients. She loved to sip on sugary cold drinks all day toward the end though. I still remember watching A League of Their Own with her (one of our favorite movies growing up) one afternoon. After she asked me to help her to her bed to take a nap, and that was the last time she was ever coherent. By the time she woke up it was like a switch had been flipped and she just wasn't really there any more. I went out and got her every flavoring for water I could find so she could at least enjoy sipping on something still, but she only spent another half day awake at that point before slipping into the final sleep.\n\n\nThey diagnosed her and gave her 6-12 months. I rushed my engagement and wedding to be done in 3 months so she could attend but she ended up skyping in from the hospital, and  passing at home a week after the ceremony. Pancreatic cancer can go fuck itself.",

You could tell she wasn't totally comfortable with it. At one point in the bonus round, the guy won and went to give Vanna a hug and she said \"oh you want a hug...okay\". You could tell she felt really awkward about it because no one really ever hugged Pat. Anyway, the following week i guess they told the contestants not to do that and she's been fine and you can tell she was getting more comfortable with hosting.",

As a 32 year old man who has been watching since I was a kid I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready; but it would be a hell of a way for him to go out. The fact that they were able to convince all three of them to compete with each other so quickly is what convinced me of this theory more than anything.\n\nI also subscribe to the other possibility that the \u201cprize\u201d of this tournament will actually be to become Alex\u2019s successor as host; but I\u2019m not sure if he is cool with the obvious **Willy Wonka** comparisons with that premise.

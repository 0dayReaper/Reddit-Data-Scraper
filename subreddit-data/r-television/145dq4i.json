Increased fatigue and napping in the days before was something a friend experienced before being taken by ambulance for cardiac symptoms. Ended up needing a triple bypass. He thought he was just getting old but he said recently (like week or two before) he started napping after work. Out of character for him but again he just thought he was getting old/tired. It\u2019s important to stay on top of annual blood work if you can, too.",

And it's possible to have a heart attack without chest pain.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to have heart attack symptoms unrelated to chest pain, such as:\n\nNeck, jaw, shoulder, upper back or upper belly (abdomen) discomfort\nShortness of breath\nPain in one or both arms\nNausea or vomiting\nSweating\nLightheadedness or dizziness\nUnusual fatigue\nHeartburn (indigestion)\nThese symptoms may be vague and not as noticeable as the crushing chest pain often associated with heart attacks. This might be because women tend to have blockages not only in their main arteries but also in the smaller ones that supply blood to the heart \u2014 a condition called small vessel heart disease or coronary microvascular disease.\n\nCompared with men, women tend to have symptoms more often when resting, or even when asleep",

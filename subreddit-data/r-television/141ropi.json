Anyway whether classified as 10 movies divided into seasons or a show, do you know why the season openings seem to start midstream without any explanation to character disappearances from the storylines?",

Maybe it's started to be classified as a show because of how many of them there are? I think because they're meant to be stand alone films with some overarching stuff, explanations for stuff like that wasn't a high priority. Like how they don't explain what happened to the last Bond girl when it's time for a new film.",

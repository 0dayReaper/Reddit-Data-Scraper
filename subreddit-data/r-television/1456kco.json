I can't put my finger on it but I'm enjoying it my question is though is there any character development are there any stories about the characters or are all the stories about the characters just solving the crimes and lawsuits?",

In no actual world would a federal agent and a professional witness be permitted to be in a relationship and work together. They'd be separated immediately. That's why the showrunners said it would NEVER happen, right before it did.\n\nNo thanks.",

Also there's the whole thing with Lyle and the cute accountant chick who might potentially not be who she says she is.\n\nBut in terms of further development, one thing I could see (though it might not necessarily be with any unrelated-and-thus-shippable-with-him male character we've seen before) is Todd discovering his own bisexuality and having to cope with how much a crush on a guy is shaking up his world",

    "postText": "I am an incredible fan of Alan Ball's and Nancy Oliver's work. Currently, I am watching True Blood for the first time and nearing the end of the second season.\n\nSince S1E1 I have found the character of Sookie Stackhouse insufferable. This is by design, right? We are meant to roll our eyes and wish that one of the other characters would drive her out of town and leave her on the side of the road never to return?\n\nEvery scene with her makes me feel like I'm watching Gumby giving free life coaching to vampires. \n\nAnyone else?",

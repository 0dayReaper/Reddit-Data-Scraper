    "postText": "I loved the performances by Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton, and Allison Tolman. The story itself was also good enough.\n\nHowever it stretches the limit of believability even for a TV show sometimes, the hospital stuff in episode 6 with nobody noticing Lester left was on par with a cartoon. It's the idiot plot point of the season. Also Key and Peele were completely pointless in the last couple of episodes.\n\nI give the season around an 8/10 but it wasn't really top tier for me, wondering how season 2 is.",

It's at least established that the police force is incompetent except for Molly so I can buy that stuff, otherwise though there are less excuses.\n\nThe first episode was probably the best with a couple other peaks. It's definitely a solid and maybe even great series, but even for an unrealistic show this was stretching the limits of unbelievability at parts.",

I think Martin Freeman is a bit jarring too, but I blame that on being a brit myself. \n\nSeason 2 is absolutely top tier television though, and Season 3 is brilliant too. I'm jealous of anyone who hasn't watched those yet.\n\n - Posted using the Sync app",

That is a sane and grounded explanation compared to some of the shit that gets people into or out of a jam in the later seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s not supposed to be realistic.

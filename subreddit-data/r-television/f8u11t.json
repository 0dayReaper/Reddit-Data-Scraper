Despite his disgust at the individual, he was obligated to do his best to defend the client and successfully did so because there was reasonable doubt. Long story short, he convinced the jury that they couldn\u2019t definitively prove from some video footage that a crime had been committed.\n\nHowever, he refused to shake his client\u2019s hand and told him he never wanted anything to do with him again",

                    "comment": "I hope one day they throw Luc Besson in there with him. I\u2019m talking about a man who was in his 30s when he actually fucked/married/impregnated a 15 year-old girl who would give birth to his child at the age of 16 and then he would divorce and leave her for a 20 year-old Milla Jovovich. It may all be legal in France so some may think it's ok but it's still looked down upon even over there and he still did it. Both young women he met on the sets of his own films he was directing, which I believe is a predatory act since these two girls must've looked up to him since he was in charge.\nHe really does love the thought of being intimate with the very young, just look at this shocking real excerpt from the original script of Leon The Professional:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/izGrzd2.jpg\n\nLuckily for Natalie Portman, it was cut from the film but that doesn't change the fact that Luc Besson actually wrote that and it was included in the original script. Portman even mentions in her documentary that when she read the original script for the film, it made her cry knowing that she had such an inappropriate role. \n\nAlthough that scene was never filmed, Besson still went ahead and intentionally sexualized her and made it a romance between them which he removed aspects of for the US release.\n\nSome may want to argue that the sexualization of a child wasn\u2019t the intention of the film, but based on the \u201cInternational Cut\u201d, deleted movie scenes, and the original script, it\u2019s clear that it was definitely intentional. It\u2019s a film that starts off showing a child in\u00a0her underwear. The US version of the film is missing 25+ minutes that you could still see today in the \u201cInternational Cut\u201d where Mathilda actually dresses up and attempts to seduce L\u00e9on, asking him to have sex and says to him that she wishes that he could be her lover. She also tells a hotel clerk that they are going to have sex. The aftermath of that scene is still in the US version, when L\u00e9on and Mathilda wake up in bed together.\u00a0In another cut scene L\u00e9on walks in on Mathilda while she is taking a shower. There is a deleted scene for the film in which L\u00e9on gives Mathilda a dress to wear, tells her he likes the way it looks on her, and then whispers to her about sex. There\u2019s also another scene in a restaurant where she kisses him. Throughout the whole film she\u2019s wearing outfits including low-cut corsets, belly shirts, and booty-shorts even though she\u2019s 12. \n\nTo put it simply the film was made with sexual intention in mind. Every clip that has awkward sexual moments between the characters was intended to be that way. It\u2019s not meant to be a father/daughter dynamic.\n\nLuc Besson has at least 6 rape allegations against him as recent as 2018. So yeah, fuck him. The Fifth Element is a great film but I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say that I was absolutely thrilled to see Valerian fail at the box office. He only deserves the worst in life and he should be more properly shunned by Hollywood than he currently is. \n\nThere are still plenty of monsters like Weinstein out there unfortunately.",

I took it as \"this guy is a hardass and fought hard for this movie, so we love him even though he's an asshole\".\n\nIt's still aged like milk, but I find it difficult to watch that whole clip and take the \"kind, gentle\" bit literally. Especially when it's met with laughter and followed by \"honestly, he did some good things one time\". Nobody ever says \"rough around the edges but a heart of gold\" about someone who is easy to be around.\n\nThe reason Weinstein was so untouchable for so long is that he campaigned hard for his movies and he got results. Before it became known that he is a rapist, he was known as someone who would fight dirty and hard for his movies. That earns a lot of gratitude from people who owe their careers to those movies.",

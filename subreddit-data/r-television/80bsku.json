They will do an EKG, stress test, (running on the treadmill), family history, and you should pay to have a CT calcium test (some insurance won't cover it). The calcium test will measure the amount of calcium in your arteries to see if you're at risk due to a blockage.\n\nI first went in my mid 30s due to a bad family history (father died 64, and grandfather at 58, both due to heart attacks).  \n\nEdit: I'm not a doctor.

I would caution others, though, that these tests do sometimes result in false positives that can send you to more treatment that turns out to be expensive, time consuming, stressful and unnecessary. The average person in his mid-30s does not need to do this, but a person with your family history does.",

Both were physicians.\n\nI started lifting more regularly in 2004, and in 2012 kicked my overall activities into high gear with CrossFit. Despite that, I've found that my cardio performance sorta hits the wall sooner than others in my group. Like after the first round, especially if burpees are involved. So I've kinda taken to pacing myself.\n\nThe cardio thing has had me concerned for a while, so I booked time with a cardiologist (family doc had no other suggestions). Did the stress test in January, reviewed the results last week.\n\nBasically got the \"all clear\" from him. He added that the muscle wall thickness was in good shape, and he noted that my treadmill performance was great for someone my age \"or younger\". In brief, he had no concerns.\n\nI reiterated my workout performance concerns. He suggested I ask my family doc.  *grumble*\n\nThe only other times I run into cardio performance issues is on the mat (BJJ), which I've been doing for about 6 months now. Certain warmups and certain drills just drain me.",

He woke up, went to his kitchen, poured hot chocolate mix on the floor because he was hungry, then took what he thought was aspirin for his \"headache\" but was actually acetaminophen.\n\nThe ER doc said it was for the better since he didn't get to the ER until some hours later.

They hooked her up to an EKG and she started to spasm then. Luckily she was at a medical facility and ems was already en route, so they saved her life. They said had she been anywhere but where she was at or at an actual hospital, she wouldn\u2019t have survived. \n\nLuckily the people at the small urgent care knew immediately, and they saved her life because they knew what to do in that moment. Medical personnel, especially nurses don\u2019t ever get the thanks they deserve. We took them some donuts and a thank you card. that heart attack is so lethal. They said roughly 25% survive if they\u2019re at a hospital when it actually hits and only 12% if they\u2019re not. Thanks all you docs and nurses out there for doing what you do!",

It was a slow Monday night, fifteen minutes from closing, when a celebrity came into the completely empty place with his wife and their young daughter. Well, shit. I put on a happy face, sat them down, and did that thing where you try to combine serving a table with closing procedures. I should never have bothered, because of course I couldn\u2019t do 99% of that stuff until all the customers were gone. The star and his wife were very friendly, and their daughter, who was four or five, was a delight. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to bitch too much, because their check was about $35 and he left a 100% tip. Seriously: exactly 100%. I don\u2019t remember the exact amount, but if it was $35.77, he left $71.54 in cash and change. And they finally got up to leave.\n\nThen, before the door could close behind him, his hand thrust back in to hold it open. He came storming back.\n\n\u201cYou guys close at 10?\u201d\n\nRight.\n\n\u201cWhat time did we get here?\u201d\n\nAround 9:45.\n\n\u201cJesus. No wonder this place was empty the whole time.\u201d He was genuinely, sincerely upset. I mean it: his hands were shaking a tiny bit and he was talking unreasonably fast. \u201cLook. I have the life I have today because I won the lottery in a way. I\u2019m no more or less deserving of anything than anybody, and I always promised myself I\u2019d never pull entitled bullshit like this.\u201d\n\nWell, it wasn\u2019t like you did it on purpose.\n\n\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s still something to be said for being considerate enough to look at the hours on the door. How many people are still here?\u201d\n\nMyself, a cook, an assistant manager, and a busboy.\n\n\u201cOkay. You can tell that being diplomatic with me isn\u2019t going to work, right? I swear I\u2019ll be extremely fast, but don\u2019t bother with the \u2018don\u2019t worry about it, sir\u2019 crap. I want to talk to all four of you right now because I will make this right.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was, but I absolutely knew in that moment that truer words had never been spoken. I went to the back where my three co-workers were and I said, basically, that the guy who just left came back and wanted to talk to all of us, and I REALLY think we should go up there. Somehow, they too knew that this was serious shit. We quickly walked to the front.\n\n\u201cLike I told C.J. here, I\u2019m really, honestly upset with myself for delaying you guys. I don\u2019t want you guys to go home angry at me or angry at your job for forcing you to deal with dumbasses like me. Another thing I told C.J. was that there\u2019s no point in arguing, because I won\u2019t let this go. Are there any questions at all?\u201d\n\nThere were none, and he handed us each one of the four piles of one thousand fucking dollars in cash he\u2019d neatly made on the register counter.\n\nSo, Kevin Smith is a good dude.\"\n\n**(Editor\u2019s Note: Say whatever you want about him and his work, this story jibes very strongly with everything I\u2019ve heard about Kevin Smith as a customer\u2014and I\u2019ve heard a surprising amount about him, probably exactly for this reason.)** [Link](https://kitchenette.jezebel.com/stories-of-celebrities-in-restaurants-1740792794)\n\n",

What got me was he said people don\u2019t know what stage their heart disease is in when they discover they might have a problem. My Dad had a quadruple bypass when I was in high school. Worked long hours and never took care of himself. \n\nWith heart disease, many shrug off their decline in health to being nothing or simply old age. Since decline is gradual it is often not noticeable. Look for the small changes and think about what you were able to achieve years ago physically without shortness of breath or chest pains. \n\nWhy it often gets missed is that the downward decline isn\u2019t a straight line, but a wave. Your decline, or trough, will be succeeded by an increase of feeling well, the crest. What often goes unnoticed is your new max crest for your health\u2019s amplitude is just a little less lower than what your last one was. The next trough becomes a little lower followed by another crest not as high as the last. Then over time your health starts to wane, eventually being hit with a heart attack. \n\nWe all think we would be able to feel our health plummeting as we get older if it was due to heart disease, but this creeps up on you. As we get older, life gets busy and convoluted with responsibility. We don\u2019t have time to exercise, we drink, we eat comfort foods, and we stress. It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot and we lie to ourselves saying, \u201coh I must be getting old because my metabolism is slowing down \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m this way.\u201d In reality, we slowly stopped taking care of ourselves without even noticing, or for some of us, perhaps we never did. \n\nIt\u2019s never too late, though. Eat some veggies, be more mindful about how well rounded and nutritious your diet is, enjoy a drink (don\u2019t hammer them), go for walks, do a little yoga or tai chi (use an app if you\u2019re unsure, but highly recommend a class), work on healthy sleep habits &amp; hygiene, and most of all, be playful. If there are things in the way, find balance. Got kids? Help yourself live a healthy life by making one for them and join in. ",

A little factoid to keep in mind is that if you're having chest pain with exertion or at rest, that means that somewhere in your coronary arteries you have a 70% or greater block. The vessels in your heart can compensate for blockages up to 70%. So if you have pain regularly, it's best to get to the doctor asap and they can do a 'stress test' to definitively see what % blockage you have. \n\nsource: 3rd year med student",

Symptoms include any of the following... chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, palpitations. Usually these occur with some exertion (like climbing a flight of stairs) as your heart works harder to pump blood to your body.\n\nRisk factors for developing CAD... Family history of CAD, peripheral artery/vascular disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and many others ",

If you're looking for critical analysis, he's probably not the person you wanna go to, but if you just want to hear thoughts from someone who is generally upbeat, a fan of most things, and understands the industry, he's always enjoyable to listen to.\n\nHe even had positive things to say about Suicide Squad, but mostly because his daughter Harley was really into it and it made him happy. He named his daughter after Harley Quinn so it was sort of special to see her enjoying the character on the big screen.\n\nI remember when he was talking about BvS, he was able to make all the legitimate complaints about it but still not come off like he was pissed. He was so happy just to have Batman and Superman on screen. He appreciated the work that went into it, he appreciated what they did right, but had reservations that he voiced even-handedly, thoughtfully, and respectfully.\n\nI love people that can offer their opinions like that, contrasted to someone like Moviebob where it's just indignant, condescending complaining like the movie fucked their mother. It's honestly why I can't take many of people that complain about Last Jedi seriously because they sound like it's triggering them or something, and at that point objectivity goes out the window.\n\nEdit: spelling",

He stood by Jason on his road to recovery, paying for everything along the way.\n\nHe is the only celebrity I've ever met who is who he is, and now I'm laying here in bed,  in tears that someone I barely know, yet somehow also know very well, may leave this world before his time.\n\n\nYou may be at peace with paying the tab Kev, but it ain't fuckin closing time yet.",

It seems the stress factor as a business owner and soon to be single father (the mother is all fucked up in the game and ive been trying to hold on and help and it seems i cant anymore and cant let my child be a part of it) are going to be the hardest to overcome. Ive made an appointment with a general practitioner for thursday. I havent been to the dr in years out of fear of what id hear and never had the motivation of my child until recently. I cook healthy food for my kid every day and will be forcing myself to eat those same things he does that i never did or liked. Vegetables and seafood have been enemies of mine for a long time. But things need to change and you all have motivated me to suck it up and do the damn thing properly. I also just got back from our first walk to the park. Usually i drive. Today we walked. This afternoon we will too. Thank you reddit! ",

Rapid placement of a stent can prevent cardiac tissue from dying. Literally, time is muscle. Typically if you catch it within 4 hours of an acute total occlusion, the muscle affected will be stunned and not killed. It will recover with restored blood flow. If you wait too long, you will end up with less function or no function in the affected area. So if you experience acute chest discomfort, left arm pain/numbness, shortness of breath, jaw pain, especially with profuse sweating, paleness or fatigue. Call 911. Paramedics can get an EKG in the field and prepare the ER for a heart attack patient, speeding your care. Never drive yourself. Having a cardiac arrest (the heart goes into a fatal rhythm from the heart attack) can cause a car accident and make the situation way worse. Think Macho Man Randy Savage, because he had a cardiac arrest and died in a car accident. If he did, you could, too.",

            "comment": "Well... I say they don\u2019t know why, they speculate that a small clot from my open heart surgery 3.5 months prior got caught and then grew. \n\nI had not been exercising regularly and was a bit (not horribly overweight) because of a high risk pregnancy. The open heart surgery was for aortic dissection and afterwards I had to eat incredibly healthy. \n\nI actually started having the pain on a Saturday but it came and went pretty quickly. The following Tuesday I had bowling and one team was completely missing and one of my team members wasn\u2019t there so we were moving pretty quickly and I felt seriously out of breathe. But it went away when I sat. By Friday I just felt really off and went to the hospital and was told they didn\u2019t see anything but they wanted me to go to a bigger better hospital because of my history. Bigger hospital found nothing, sent home next morning. I tell myself over and over you are crazy and paranoid keep moving. The following Tuesday I was done. I started having thoughts of dying and just knowing it was right around the corner. Went to the hospital that night, did an echo/sono (not sure if there is really a difference) on my neck. I couldn\u2019t lay down for more than 10 seconds at a time without panicking, 100% sure my tech and (ex) husband thought I was crazy. Again nothing shows on the tests so they send me to the bigger hospital again. Doctor comes in and says hey we can\u2019t find anything on the blood work but we can tell you\u2019re terrified and we believe you. We wanna do a cardiac cath just to see what\u2019s happening in there - totally normal procedure you\u2019ll be in and out. \n\nLiterally the scariest thing I have ever experienced in my life. You could hear/feel the moment the doctor found the blockage. Everyone stopped she left and went in a little observation room for what felt like forever and when she came back she kept it short and sweet, things don\u2019t look good I need to go talk to your family and get back here asap to start working. What she didn\u2019t tell me but told my family was that typically she would do OHS but I had an incredibly high Chance that wouldn\u2019t make it because my body hadn\u2019t healed enough and I was on blood thinners and it was too quick of a turn around with all the factors but that if she put in the stent and it pushed the clot she would need to stop my heart and restart it but that might not work either. My whole family said you could see her eyes watering and the fear and then she got up and she looked determined. Came back and I asked her if she could give me stuff to put me under so I wouldn\u2019t know if I died and she said nope no time, went to work and all of a sudden the pain stopped and at the same moment she let out a sigh. It was done and I started to sob. She told me I had to stop because she didn\u2019t have time to cry. And that was it.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about how the body works but mine simultaneously hated me enough to try and kill me and loved me enough to just keep pushing through. \n\nSorry for the wall of text but I guess what my point has always been in telling this story is trust your body. We all get aches and pains that might be scary but when your body is off it\u2019s probably going to tell you, even if the doctors can\u2019t find it. Listen to it and be an advocate for yourself. Check and double check because even the most unlikely people can have some crazy shit going on. ",

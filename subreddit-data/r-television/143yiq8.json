    "postText": "Season one is brilliant. I watched season 1 a few days after having finished the novel (I highly recommend reading the novel.) I actually didn\u2019t think s2 or even 3 were that bad (2 was still interesting enough to hold my attention) but by the time I hit season\n4 I was definitely kind of thinking \u201cwow, this show has fallen off.\u201d However, I still pushed myself to finish it. I finished the last episode of season 5 about fifteen minutes ago. I feel that the main character (June, played by Elisabeth Moss) steadily becomes more and more unlikable. \n\nI\u2019m now done with season 5, and I\u2019m just wondering\u2026 how is it possible that Luke isn\u2019t more bothered by June\u2019s relationship with Nick? I\u2019m already bothered by the fact that June has not just broken up with or divorced Luke in spite of the fact that she still quite obviously has feelings for Nick, but if I were in Luke\u2019s shoes, even if my partner and I had been separated for a long time I would still be more upset about any relationship she may have had whilst we were away from each other, even in a place like Gilead. I know I keep on mentioning how I don\u2019t like June but I am especially annoyed by how she won\u2019t just break it off with either Luke or Nick, something about it feels very immoral to me.",

Having finished s5 about an hour ago, I must say that it\u2019s like so much happens\u2026 but so little does at the exact same time. What I immediately thought after finishing s5 is that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be rewatching the entire thing anytime soon. It may be fun, months from now (or even next yr when s6 will possibly release) to rewatch the entire show, but I feel like after s3 the show declines even more than it already has.\n\nAnd June becomes hard to sympathize with, for me, around about season 3. She has really bad foresight and a lot of people around her get hurt because of it. Having finished season 5 I can now say that I dislike her.",

I think that part's way more complex than anything they've actually done on this show. Luke was separated from June for, what, two-three years? Maybe more? June was stuck enslaved and the only couple of people that were remotely kind to her included Nick. In a society where June was mostly just fighting to survive, she found comfort in Nick. I think it's more of a complex situation, where she might have fallen for Nick, but under the worst kind of circumstances. Maybe not quite Stockholm Syndrome, but it was also an unusual \"fight to survive\" way of dealing with Gilead that led to complicated feelings.\n\nIn that sense, Luke shouldn't be more upset about her getting herself into a complicated situation because, yeah, the circumstances were complicated. June only had Nick and a Martha to lean on in that place for a while. \n\nThat being said, the best thing June could do is take time for herself because Gilead messed her up BAD. She's too far broken to be in any kind of relationship right now, and maybe not for a long, long time. \n\nI stopped right at the start of season 4, so cannot speak to how Luke/June reconciled and what's happened on that front.",

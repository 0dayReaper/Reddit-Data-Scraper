            "comment": "Here's the statement from Louis C.K:\n\n&gt;I want to address the stories told to\u00a0The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not.\n\n&gt;These stories are true. \u00a0At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn\u2019t a question. It\u2019s a predicament for them. \u00a0\u00a0The power I had over these women is that they admired me. \u00a0And I wielded that power irresponsibly.\nI have been remorseful of my actions. And I\u2019ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I\u2019m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position.\n\n&gt;I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn\u2019t want to hear it. I didn\u2019t think that I was doing any of that because\u00a0my position allowed me not to think about it.\n\n&gt;There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with.\n\n&gt;I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.\n\n&gt;The hardest regret to live with is what you\u2019ve done to hurt someone else. \u00a0And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them.\u00a0I\u2019d be remiss to exclude the hurt that I\u2019ve brought on people who I work with and have worked with who\u2019s professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused.\u00a0I\u2019ve brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years.\nI\u2019ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.\n\n&gt;I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. \u00a0I will now step back and take a long time to listen.\n\n&gt;Thank you for reading.\n\n",

That person could then judge whether it's better to let the victim know or not, and when. That's the best I could come up with.  ",

Will Call You Up to Talk About His Alleged Sexual Misconduct\", don't think anything gawker can be posted to reddit), when CK called up someone calling him out on his shit to simply find out what he knew, then never followed up or addressed it when he knew he wouldn't face repercussions.\n\n&gt;His interpretation was that C.K. was \u201csizing me up\u201d to \u201cfind out what I had heard.\u201d Jason left the conversation under the impression that the two would speak again soon. In the four or so months since, they haven\u2019t.\n\nFrom the original NYT* article, it certainly paints a picture that there was an implicit target on the accusers' careers from CK's agent:\n\n&gt;Soon after, they said they understood from their managers that Mr. Becky, Louis C.K\u2019s manager, wanted them to stop telling people about their encounter with Louis C.K. Lee Kernis, one of the women\u2019s managers at the time, confirmed on Thursday that he had a conversation in which he told Mr. Becky that Louis C.K.\u2019s behavior toward the women had been offensive. Mr. Kernis also said that Mr. Becky was upset that the women were talking openly about the incident.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Ms. Halpern and Robert Schroeder \u2014 Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov\u2019s agent at the time \u2014 said that the pair told them that they felt they had been warned to stop talking.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Mr. Becky arguably wields even more power in comedy than Louis C.K. He represents Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler and other top performers, and his company, 3 Arts, puts together programming deals for nearly every platform.\n\n...\n\n&gt;In the years since, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov have found some success, but they remained concerned about Mr. Becky and took themselves out of the running for the many projects he was involved in. Though their humor is in line with what he produces, \u201cwe know immediately that we can never even submit our material,\u201d Ms. Wolov said.",

Louis definitely took advantage of his power and hurt people but he wasn't taking advantage of underage boys or straight up raping people. He tried to justify his actions by asking these women. You can see a hint of morality in his actions even trying to apologize to some of them years later. The problem was he was still doing it and didn't realize what it was like to be those women in those situations. You could see a hint of humanity in his actions. Can't say the same for Spacey or Weinstein. It was obvious they didn't care and just wanted their lustful desires fulfilled. \n\nLouis isn't forgiven for his actions but you can at least see a chance for him to return from this. I doubt he'll get much action in Hollywood for years but people are forgetting stand-up isn't Hollywood. They have their own circle. They have the road. Louis will be back behind the mic soon enough where he isn't on the big stage.",

I doubt he's ever going to have a major show on HBO or FX ever again, but I also doubt that he just goes away completely without trying to reflect on this.",

It's not a power play, but like Louis said (paraphrasing): \"my position allowed me to ignore the ramifications of my actions\". His contrition, or the perceived contrition through a short letter, in addition to him speaking out on what he learns about his paraphilia in therapy, could start to make amends to the community at large that he abused.",

That said, i would just like to put this out there: \n\nIf i were one of the women who came forward with one of these stories, i would appreciate this apology. i appreciate that he took ownership, that he admitted the idiotic reason for his actions, and that his statement doesn\u2019t sound like PR bullshit. He didn\u2019t try to minimize anything or smooth anything over. He sounds ashamed of himself and remorseful, and like he feels terrible for hurting these women and all the people close to him. \n\nHe didn\u2019t rape these women. He didn\u2019t do something unforgivable. He did something creepy and selfish that made these women uncomfortable, and he sounds like he\u2019s truly sorry for being an idiot in those days. \n\nWe\u2019ve all done shitty, mean things to other people. I think when we see famous people get slandered and dramatized all over the news, we magically forget that in the past 15 years, we\u2019ve each done at least one super shitty thing to another person. The only difference is that we\u2019re not under a universal microscope and spotlight like celebrities are. \n\nExample: 5 years ago, a boyfriend broke up with me. I was shattered and blindsided. He had left some things at my apartment, so in my pathetic stupor, I decided that I would text him and tell him I had a bag of his stuff and ask him to pick it up, then try to seduce him to win him back when he came over. I literally hatched a plan to manipulate him into having sex with me one more time, thinking that maybe if I made it fantastic, he would change his mind. I tried to get him to pity me, talked him into coming to my room with me, and ended up crying while giving him a blowjob and trying to convince him to stay. It was obvious he was confused and uncomfortable, but I was a wreck and felt desperate so I did something totally dumb and out of character. I apologized a few years ago, but i still cringe thinking about it now. I can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d feel if it was suddenly on the news and all over social media. We are human. We do selfish shitty things. And we should apologize for them. We should have consequences. But we should also forgive and move on. \n\nI\u2019m okay with this statement. i would find some serious peace in my life if one of the men who has manipulated me or put me in a shitty situation were to come forward, admit to being a selfish asshole on a power trip, and apologize. i would forgive him. \n\nEdit: I hate my iPhone. \n\nEdit 2: what on EARTH just happened? Why I am being threatened and reported by half of Reddit, and praised by the other half? I was not trying to start a fight. I was just offering my perspective as a woman who has been in similar situations to these women. I don\u2019t care if they decide to forgive him, or how they choose to feel, that\u2019s up to them. I just offered how **I PERSONALLY FEEL about it.** I do hope Louis CK has to face consequences and make reparations for his shitty choices, but I also hope that his genuine apology is accepted so everyone can move on. I\u2019m glad he owned his shit instead of just coming out as gay or making excuses, like the bullshit we\u2019ve seen lately. I didn\u2019t realize that would be a horrible opinion to have. ",

It will only lead to a system where people are disincentivized from apologizing, and by extension, possibly even disincentivize people from changing their behaviour all-together.\n\nIt's human to fuck up. It's human to not want to face the consequences of your fuck-ups. It's incredibly important to forgive and help people who fuck up (as well as people affected by those fuck-ups), to prevent future ones.",

Never told anyone because I didn't want to lose my job and he had a wife and kids. \n\nI would have loved to receive any sort of acknowledgment of wrong doing. Instead I just ended up being assaulted again until I finally quit. \n\nI'm disheartened by the people here who think this was true consent on the part of the victims. It wasn't.  But I appreciate his apology and ownership of the accusations.\n\nMost of us never get that. \n\nEdit 1: it was correctly pointed out to me that it's not just men who think this way.  Thanks!",

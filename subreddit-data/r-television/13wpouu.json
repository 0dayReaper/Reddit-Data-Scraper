Anyone who is well known (she is) can apply for a star if they pay.  They are often paid for by production companies.\n\nIts not diversity, she's just mostly done things that appeal to women.",

High achievement level in the industry, 5 years or more longevity as a specific role player eg action, drama, etc., actor must show up for award ceremony unless decreased. Simply paying for it is not what makes this happen. This is absolutely a push for inclusiveness which I think is a good thing. Many Asian actors go unnoticed and this representation matters.",

    "postText": "The new \"Match\" system tells me absolutely nothing about the quality of the different shows and movies. It also seems really off, with no relation to what I actually like or would like. \n\nEdit: Lots of interesting points. My theory is that with the rise of Netflix Original programming, they don't want their new shows getting \"downvoted\" too badly. \nEdit Addendum: I actually think the lack of rating system is making me less likely to try the new original programming. \n\nEdit: I guess it's Amy Schumer's fault. Leather Romper for the loss. ",

Voting neutral for a show gives far more feedback than not voting for a show, especially when you can watch every episode of a show in one sitting and not vote, or watch only one episode and quit part way in. There are people don't vote to rate after every time they watch something.",

They figure the company isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s how YOU represented the company that is the problem. Thus, it\u2019s still your fault. From what I\u2019ve seen this is standard industry practice. \n\nI hate star rating systems for this reason. The scale is very subjective with some people giving a 10 for anything that wasn\u2019t terrible, and some people reserving an 8 or higher for the best service they\u2019ve ever had.

                            "comment": "&gt;  if you like one thing you will like all things similar, which I rarely do\n\nUsually it's more along the lines of, if you like X, Y and Z, and a lot of people who liked X, Y and Z also liked A, then you might also like A. Or in other words, people with similar interests have similar interests. \n\nThe fewer stuff you rate the worse it works, since there's fewer things to judge your tastes by. On the other hand, if you like a movie that a lot of people liked, you might get pretty generic predictions, since it was liked by a huge chunk of the userbase with pretty diverse tastes. And of course there's always a few people that can't be readily grouped with other people.\n\nIn general, it works really well when your tastes are rather narrow and constant and there's lots of people with similar interests, but of course it can't take into account things like your current mood.\n\nThere's other problems as well, for instance, lots of people like the star wars movies, so if I were to recommend you star wars, I could be pretty confident that I recommended a movie to you that you'd like. But it's a bad recommendation, since most people already saw it and would go \"well, duh\". Basically you also want the system to recommend things you've never heard of that you might like. And the less known a movie is, the more you might be surprised by and enjoy it, but the more difficult it is to be sure it's one you'd like (because it has less ratings to draw from), so there's a trade-off.\n\nAnd time figures into it, too. 10 years ago you might have really liked watching action movies, but 3 years ago your tastes started changing and now you're mostly watching romantic comedies. So the system should take that into account and weight ratings you gave in the last 1-2 months more than ones you gave 10 years ago.\n\nI looked up what algorithm Netflix uses, exactly, and it uses a combination of multiple ones, to combat some of the problems I mentioned (as well as some other problems):\n\n- First it ranks all movies it has based on others users rating. Since you probably only rated a few movies compared to all movies on Netflix, these recommendations are not that personalized and more a sort of general ranking of movies with a slight touch based on your preferences\n- It makes a shortlist of movies that have a lot of users with similar preferences to you for them, so while they might not have the highest ratings over all movies, they should be more relevant  to you specifically/they have a high confidence of being relevant\n- They have an algorithm that recognizes and recommends movies that are trending right now\n- Series are handled a bit separately, in that if you watched episodes 1-4 of a series, you'll probably also like episode 5. And if you watched episode 1-4 of Series A 5 months ago, but 1-4 of Series B last week, it'd recommend B since it's probably more relevant\n- Another algorithm creates a list for each movie that contains all movies similar to it. Then it looks what movies you watched recently, and then picks the similar-lists for those. The similarity metric is not personalized to your votes, but the list is then filtered based on your voting behaviour to try and make it personalized.\n- The output of all these different algorithms is then combined to a single list, and a separate algorithm tries to combine them in such a way that they are again ordered by what should be most relevant\n\n[source](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2843948)\n\nBut well, you're still trying to model human preferences with mathematical models, and the criteria for whether you like a movie or not are different from person to person, and sometimes if a majority of users follows one pattern, you'll get bad recommendations for a smaller group of users who doesn't follow that pattern. \n\nPlus the ratings of users themselves are noisy sometimes and not necessarily consistent over time. Maybe you rate movies higher when you're having a good day than when you're having a bad day. Or maybe it was the absolutely perfect movie for you, but some character in it said something that rubbed you the wrong way and ruined the experience for you. Or maybe you were exhausted from work, but the recommended series really needs you to pay attention and you'd love it if you did, but since you're exhausted and just wanted something to turn your mind off and chill, you didn't get into it and rated it badly. If you watched the same thing the next day after a good nights sleep, you might love it. Or you loved a movie, but you tell your friend Ted about it the next day, and he completely destroys it for you, so you change your rating.\n\nThe recommendations aren't perfect and try to simplify away the complexity of human behaviour, and the ratings aren't that good and consistent, so in the end, you end up with somewhat good recommendations, but nothing perfect. It's still an ongoing area of research.\n\n**TL;DR: recommender systems are pretty complex, and your milage may vary** ",

People don't commit to internet videos the same way they do a movie. If they don't like what they're watching, it's likely they'll just close the tab and find something else. I find that if you like/dislike regularly and just do your thing on the site, the recommendations are pretty spot-on. \n\nNetflix is a different beast, though. You don't consume movie and TV content the same way you do Internet videos.",

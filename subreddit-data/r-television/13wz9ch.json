I'm genuinely interested to know this.\n\n\"The 1981 Chic album Take It Off includes the song \"Your Love Is Cancelled\", which compares a breakup to the cancellation of TV shows. ... \"Your Love Is Cancelled\" inspired screenwriter Barry Michael Cooper to include a reference to a woman being cancelled in the 1991 film New Jack City. This usage introduced the term to African-American Vernacular English, where it eventually became more common.\"\n\n\"By around 2015, the concept of canceling had become widespread on Black Twitter to refer to a personal decision, sometimes seriously and sometimes in jest, to stop supporting a person or work... After numerous cases of online shaming gained wide notoriety, the term cancellation was increasingly used to describe a widespread, outraged, online response to a single provocative statement, against a single target.\"\n\nThe above texts are quoted from Wikipedia.",

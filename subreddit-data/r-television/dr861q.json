You know who falls asleep in the bubble? Ten year vets working with someone they've been paired up with for a few years and trust. \n\nYou know who doesn't fall asleep? Newbies. They're full of pep and worried about doing a good job and staying out of trouble. Double, they just left training where they were told if they so much as dozed off somebody would impale their testicles with a homemade Rambo knife made out of coffee cups and toothbrushes.\n\nNewbies don't doze off.",

In 1973, Barr\u2019s father Donald, the headmaster at Manhattan\u2019s Dalton School, hired Epstein as a calculus and physics teacher.\n\n&gt;While hiring Epstein, a noted mathematics genius, was not strange on its face, the hire was unusual for a couple of reasons. Epstein had not earned a college degree as he dropped out of New York\u2019s prestigious Cooper Union. The other odd circumstance was that the new teacher was only 20 years of age.\n\n\nhttps://hillreporter.com/the-ties-that-bind-jeffrey-epstein-william-barr-donald-trump-34107",

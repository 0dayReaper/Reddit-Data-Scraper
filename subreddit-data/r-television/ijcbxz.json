They likely had a plan for this, and while I don't believe they'll ever recast him, many have argued the importance of T'Challa to the future of the MCU, and made the suggestion that Boseman may have had a recast discussion (which I doubt). I'd personally like for Shuri, M'Baku or even Okoye to take up the mantle, making a consistent trilogy, but if Marvel chose an extremely talented actor as a possible recast/new character taking the throne in the Blip, I wouldn't be *too* disheartened as long as Boseman and his family recommended this. I can't speak for Boseman, but if I were playing the character, I certainly wouldn't want such an iconic and culturally important character to die with me. I also don't think a recast would be a disrespect to his legacy. Not only is the momentum continuing, but we ***always*** have Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War and Endgame. These, plus the future of the MCU, are his legacy.",

The final fight between Cap and Tony was loaded with so much symbolism it still blows me away that was a comic book movie.  Especially because they don't hit you over the head with what that final fight means, you only really understand the weight of each part if you've seen the other films.\n\nQuick break down.  Tony can't beat Steve hand to hand so he has to have the AI take over.  He isn't physically as powerful of a man as Steve.  \n\nCap still gets the upper hand because his allie is a human who simply grabs Tony's ankle.  Steve has his best friend by his side, Tony's best friend is in the hospital because of him.\n\nCap pounces and raises the shield, Tony covers his face because he thinks Cap is going to kill him with the shield.  He believes that because Tony would have killed if roles were reversed.  He isn't morally as good of a man as Steve.  \n\nCap buries his shield into Tony's arc reactor, disabling the armor completely. Tony, trapped under his greatest invention, stares at his reflection in the \"frisbee\" his father created.  Even now he still can't live up to his father's inventions.\n\nAnd he was beaten by the man his father admired more than any other, Steve Rogers.  Tony verbally lashes out, saying Steve doesn't deserve the shield.  So Steve, being a good man, drops it and walks away.\n\nA fight scene that tells an emotional story like that is rare.",

Time is the killer. It shows when you only give your CGI artists a handful of weeks to finish Black Panther\u2019s final fight scene. Meanwhile, those who worked on Infinity War knew that Thanos had to look photorealistic for the movie to work, so they allocated the necessary time to the CGI work.\n\nCGI has much more potential than practical effects, but it requires filmmakers to spend their time more wisely.",

Basically the VFK artists got thrown a monkey wrench and did the best with what they could do in the time they had. It takes a metric fuckton of time for VFX to work properly, so when you have near 0 time to do it, that's what happens. My disappointment is that Disney didn't go back and touch it up for the blueray/dvd release, which also happens",

A figurehead of the black community. A man that could afford all the treatment in the world.\n\nColon cancer is a newsworthy event now. And now it's 100% more real to people. Maybe one person who saw something in themselves in Boseman or his work, or just was a fan, will go to the doctor. And maybe one person will not die that otherwise would have.\n\nDiseases need martyrs before people realize how real they are. A sad truth.\n\nEdit: I'm no doctor and have been proven that I don't know what I'm talking about. Probably why education and awareness is important",

Studios always said no one (read White audiences) wanted to see an all star black cast in ANY serious film. Sure it's fine for them to do sanitized comedy or be the backdrop to slavery and civil rights films. The juggernaut that was this film showed that people want to see human beings of all colors and creeds succeed, it's no longer something completely reserved for White, roguish male leads. For the black community, the film gave us a reflection of Afrofuturism where black voices weren't heard through slavery, prejudice, hardship, and tragedy. Instead we had black voices that embodied strength, intelligence, and resilience. For other POC and other marginalized groups, this film showed them that a) their voices deserve a spot in media and film without resorting to stereotyped, one note characters and b) it can be profitable for studios to invest in more diverse leads c) allows diverse writers to make nuanced characters.",

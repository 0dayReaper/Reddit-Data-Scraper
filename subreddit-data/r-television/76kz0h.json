The release had some controversy, Weinstein withheld the movie, citing poor audience response. It was only released after Michael Caine threatened to withhold publicity for another film he was working on. So there's another Brendan Fraser link for conspiracy theorists.",

It's one of Fraser's few dramatic movies, but I thought he did well in it. Solid Mystery/Drama based on the book of the same name taking place during the Vietnam War. I'd highly recommend it if it's still up on Netflix. ",

There is no doubt this guy is a monster. \n\nBut he's not the only one out there. There are going to be a lot more male producers and so forth like him, preying both on men and women. And as can be seen, some people are just scumbags that are complicit and view it as a ladder to climb. \n",

Even if Weinstein had committed fraud by not fully informing the Board of Directors, the contract says before he can be fired he has a right to mediation and if that doesn't work, he's entitled to arbitration. He got neither.\u00a0He was summarily fired, and sources connected with Weinstein tell TMZ he was never given a specific reason.\n&gt;\n&gt;A source connected with TWC tells TMZ, the company had a right to fire Weinstein if he didn't notify the Board of Directors of settlements. We're told there have been no settlements since the contract was signed, so it would seem this clause does not apply.\n\nIt would be insane if he used this against them and got the firing revoked by a court.",

We know it so much that we fucking joke about it!

Good stuff.\u201d\n\nEven in this comment thread, people are \u201cguessing\u201d how many actors have \u201cbent over\u201d for their success. Even in the wake of specific allegations being made against Harvey Weinstein, people still treat the subject as a joke! This is why nothing will change.",

Simply standing up to sexist remarks carries a huge career risk. \n\nMy advice to all young women: Think of your HR department as part of the companies legal department. HR will immediately report your complaints to legal, and they to senior management. The combined reactions will be to protect the company, not you. \n\nSo document everything. Specifically make a written note about any interaction with the creeps that you will eventually encounter. Date, time, place, what was said, how you reacted, and who you reported it to. Your lawyer will want this info. ",

One of the last scenes in Barry has nice fluffy snow on some steps (in some place probably in LA), where there would be either packed snow or just straight slush. But the absolute worst fake snow is the outdoors Nebraska scenes in Better Call Saul. Blasted white 'stuff' on the side of trees with leaves on them. Straight up immersion breaking at that point.",

The cast for both the young and middle-aged characters is fantastic, and the premise is one of the best to pop up on TV in the last few years, but holy hell the execution is all over the place. This season in particular really went overboard with hallucinations and needless stylistic flourishes. They\u2019ve also already hit the wall large ensemble shows inevitably do where there are too many plot lines and characters going, so none of them get enough screen time over the whole season, or they have to write a filler plot in for a character because having them do nothing would be weird. It took True Blood like four seasons to run into this problem, this show didn\u2019t even make it halfway through season two before it started to fall apart.\n\nExcited for season three, though!",

Its schlocky in some scenes but then melodrama in the next. The survival/Wilderness scenes are great and the adult storyline is meandering and kinda nonsensical. \n\nI love the show but damn it feels like they don't know where to go. Hopefully the writers strike gets them to pump the breaks and come up with a tight 3rd season to wrap everything up, because I doubt we're gonna see a S4.",

Then, in season two you find out right away that they actually just wanted to save her, and there isn't anything nefarious going on.\n\nAt this point, what mysteries do you even want them to answer? The only outstanding mystery I can think of was introduced at the very end of the season two finale.",

Of course, everything so far *could* be explained by rational means, but it would just be too far fetched at this point. I wouldn't expect the show to give a definitive answer, however. The writers are too intoxicated with the smell of their own farts.\n\n**Who did they hunt down and kill?**\n\nIrrelevant. The interesting part about the whole scene has already been revealed. They periodically select someone to be sacrificed to the wilderness (and to feed the others), and this person can either try to escape or give themselves willingly. The person on the cold opening fell in one of the traps set up by the group to catch whoever is selected.\n\n\n**Why does that lady sleepwalk?**\n\nThe entity is using/controlling her to further it's own goals.",

In Yellowjackets, you get a pretty good idea of what's going on very quickly (like maybe even from just watching the trailer) and it's more about just watching it play out.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what I'd compare it to. I only watched one season of The 100 and barely remember it, but maybe that? It's definitely closer to \"Mom said we have Lost at home\" than it is to actual Lost.",

Introducing new characters in your past timeline doesn\u2019t really smack of \u201chaving 5 seasons planned\u201d. If you needed these characters in any capacity you would have already set them up earlier, because doing anything else is jarring as hell. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if the season gets any better but the television landscape now offers so many choices that I feel less inclined to stick around if I\u2019m not feeling it. I predict a lot of wheel-spinning from this show, which is fine, just stop pretending there\u2019s a planned arc when it\u2019s obvious there isn\u2019t one.",

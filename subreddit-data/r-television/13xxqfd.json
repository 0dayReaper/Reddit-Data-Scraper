I never critic shows very often but this one is just not good at all. It has nothing to do with budget, it's just the writing, acting, plot, just all of it is terrible. Richard Madden deserves much more than this show. Also zero chemistry between leads and no real depth to any characters, also none are likable really..\n\nI like shows like Pandora, Runaways, The Ark, I even semi enjoyed Vampire Academy, all of those are fairly poorly made shows but I still enjoyed them, so me saying this show is bad says quite a lot.",

That's something you should know if you decide to watch it: it's one of these \"it gets better after a few episodes\" shows.\n\nAnother thing to know is that imdb considers the prequel season *Gods of the Arena* to be a separate show. It's not a spin-off, it's season 2. I say that because many people end up watching it first (because it is a prequel) or last (because of the imdb thing I mentioned earlier). The proper order is *Blood and Sand*,  then *Gods of the Arena*, then *Vengeance*, and *War of the Damned*.",

No disrespect to the actor who replaced him, I hear he was handpicked by Whitfield and I'm sure he does a commendable job but I couldn't get past it personally.

After that it gets so much better.\n\nUnfortunately the actor who plays Spartacus, Andy Whitfield, passed away after season 1. But his replacement, Liam McIntyre, was just as incredible in the role in my opinion.\n\nAs for your question about nudity, there is tons of male nudity actually.",

    "postText": "Still remember the Hold Steady version of \"Bear and Maiden\" from Game of Thrones.  It was a punk version of that canonical song.  It was right after what happened to Jamie just as the credits were rolling at the end of the episode - Loud Electric Guitars!\n\nWhat happened to Jamie was so shocking, that I was even more shocked to hear 21st century guitars ringing out.  I was left in complete and in utter emotional awe.  It was a great trick.\n\nWhat's your favorite use of modern music in a period-set TV show?",

We expect them now but that first season watching the ballroom scene and realizing that it was Ariana Grande was something else.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcjPScd6pE&amp;ab_channel=S",

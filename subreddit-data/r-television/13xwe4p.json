Congrats geniuses I'm now paying half that and debating cancelling till they have a show in want to watch. \n\nBasically back to what I used to do with cable dropping channels when the shows i watch are over and watching new shows on demand when the shows I know I watch come back",

But instead we got greed.",

It was always implied that parents could use the 4 screen option to share with their kids and vice versa. They then turned around and pretended they never implied that was the purpose. Now they\u2019re adding a premium on top of the premium we already paid even though we were using the feature as advertised. It\u2019s why I\u2019m getting rid of it even though I only shared it with my parents (I paid for Netflix for them and myself).",

However I do put in the effort to be there for a few people bc well, if I'm not even taking 2 seconds to text what kind of friend/Family am I? \n\nYou're right, I think a lot of people just don't bc society accepts it and tells them not to feel guilty when at the end of the day it is kinda shitty to not be there for people. \n\nBut nowadays no one really *needs* anyone else either. There's no actual necessity for networking, being a good friend etc. Sadly, with the need to network being gone people are showing their true colors that they won't be there unless they have to. \n\nThe days of tight knit towns, neighborhoods, communities etc. Seem to be over. \"Why should I interact with my neighbor? I don't need their help!\" Is part of why many neighborhoods are full of strangers nowadays. \n\nHell, I'm 32 and almost no one in my circle meets up or is close anymore. Know who's close, who stays tight even in their thirties? Those that are into drugs bc they need each other. \"Hit up Justin he's got some pain pills, plus maybe he'll buy my leftover script this month\" kind of thing. When I was a druggie I had all kinds of friends in multiple circles. Now being sober it's very rare that any of my sober friends interact. They do their own thing except for rare occasions where they'll be around other people. \n\nIt's really weird.",

They've stopped having record growth because nothing can grow infinitely.\n\nThe competition hasn't saturated the market, *Netflix* has. Anyone who can afford Netflix has it. Anyone who doesn't have it probably never will.\n\nAlso the reason for their first subscriber loss ever was because it was coming out of the pandemic lockdown. A bunch of people signed up for Netflix because they had nothing else to do but sit in their houses and watch streaming services. When that passed, people unsubscribed.

I am in the group that if I didn't have other people that watch my Netflix I likely would have cancelled it on multiple occasions, especially since HBO Max came out (though that's less of a thing as of late since they are already making it less attractive). I had a roommate I lived with for over a decade and they shared all of my streaming stuff, and they are only gone for around a year but now suddenly they can't share Netflix, and they aren't going to go get their own account and I'm not paying even more money to slap them on as a side account.\n\nNetflix isn't what it used to be for people that would legit get it just for The Office plus the Netflix stuff, and after losing that, losing all the Marvel stuff, all the Fox animation, it's not the go to it was a few years ago. People are naive to think there will be a mass influx of Netflix subs if you cut people off from accounts that have been sharing with them.

That 30% decline is an acceleration from 24% in Q4 and 11% in Q3. \n\nIt also lost 200k in north America subscribers. Only .2% decline, but it's competition is growing against their decline. \n\n\nIt is likely that Netflix has saturated the market and this change allows the potential customers.\n\nBut the idea that this is data driven is absurd. They absolutely have analysts putting together data that backs up the decision by leadership, but that is different than data driven. I can make anything look like a good idea with data.\n\nThey made this decision based on the data point of \"we saturated the market and are declining... How can we get back on track\" and some MBA said \"end password sharing\" and it became a goal of its own.",

They base everything they do on that data. It's why people get frustrated when they cancel a show they perceive as popular, well it wasn't or netflix wouldn't have cancelled it, eg it wasn't being watched enough to justify the cost so it's gone.\n\nThat they make the right decisions most of the time can be seen by the fact they have been profitable every single year since 2010, many years bringing in over 1 billion in profit, and growing revenue almost every year as well.\n\nYou can imagine scenarios on what you think subscribers will do all you like but it is you who are being na\u00efve if you don't think the whole reason netflix banned password sharing in smaller markets first wasn't to make sure when they did it in larger markets it wouldn't cost them too much money. I never said they wouldn't lose some subscribers, just that if it hurt them too much they wouldn't be doing it in large markets, that's why they trialed it. And I bet they saw in those trials the losses were minimal and long term it might even be better when people want their own account. You can make guesses all you want but netlfix already did this in a bunch of markets, if it was a disaster they would have stopped. That they didn't tells you they are confident long term this will help them.\n\nEdit: Looking at the data from *having already done this* in other markets and extrapolating it to larger markets like the US is not ego or making assumptions, this is an informed decision by them, not a shot in the dark.",

They made profits because they had a strong brand, but cancelling a lot of popular shows and focusing on quantity over quality have started to seriously hurt their brand. I work with marketing and can tell you that having a good brand can mean a lot\n\nMany still use Netflix because it's still big and well known. There's a comfort to that for many, but some of their decisions are pushing a lot away. You also have users that consider only using Netflix for periods at a time, instead of all the time as they used to\n\nOh btw their data on what users like haven't been that successful either, because the data doesn't tell why they like it. Netflix used to create a lot of buzz with some of their shows, but that's not as much the case these days and many argue that most of their shows have become mediocre\n\nWhen you work on a lot of data, you really need to dig into the data to fully understand it",

One market will prefer one type of show over another, will be fine with price hikes while another will see big sub drops, another will have more subs that stick around every month while other markets have a higher rate of people only resubbing to watch Stranger Things etc.",

There is a ton of stuff available in the US that I don't have access to in Canada and I imagine that this is true of most of their international markets. I have no problem cancelling Netflix for a few months when there isn't a lot on I'm interested in and then re-signing up once there are a few shows I want to watch. I also know there are lots of people like me that won't start watching a new show even if it seems to be popular until I find out if they've decided to make a second season. I'm assuming that throws off their algorithm and gets some shows cancelled prematurely.",

The rest was in stock options, which neither have received full access to yet (Rivian's won't be able to access his until 2027, and half of his $422M was in the form of a stock option that only vests if the stock price stays above a certain threshold for a certain period of time). \n\nThat's not really that unusual, that's how Musk's net worth skyrocketed - back in 2018 he agreed to take 0 compensation from Tesla, but in exchange he would get $55B if Tesla hit a $650B market cap within the decade. And that's what happened (they've dropped since the peak but are still around 650 today).",

I just wanted to punch him in the face every time he was on the screen. \n\nBut I really liked the rest of the show! The one-off episodes channeled the same wacky energy as the anime. Sure it didn\u2019t live up to the standard set by the original, but obviously a mid-budget live action adaptation is going to have its limitations. The show certainly showed flashes of real potential. Then the fanboys fucked it up by being ridiculously overdramatic on the internet and now we get no new cowboy bebop content probably ever.\n\nThat said, the Vicious plot lines and character choices were truly indefensible. I honestly don\u2019t know if the show could have rebounded from that without a complete reset. Realistically I think their best play would have been to sideline that whole story, lean into its strengths, and evolve its own fun take on the western space genre.

I will go back to watch the final season  of those two shows when they land but will cancel within a month after I binge them. I don\u2019t know if it will be good for Netflix or bad for them but I\u2019m done, way to much money a month for a platform that no longer holds my interest and I know quite a few people who are canceling for the same reason. Whatever their business plan is it seems they are going to follow blockbuster into obscurity because they are making themselves irrelevant.",

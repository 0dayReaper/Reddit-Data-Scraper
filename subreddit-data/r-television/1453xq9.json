One of the few things my sister and I could agree on (this and Gilligan) when we had to share TV time after school as 80s latchkey kids.\n\nWas the series always in color?\n\nI thought it started in black and white, and went to color later?\n\nedit: I googled it.  The first several seasons were in black and white, but they have been colorized and released on DVD/VHS over the years in that format.  Thought I had misremembered for a second.",

The reruns I watched up to that point always used the revised version of the song, so it was rather jarring to hear for the first time and all I could do was laugh at how awkward it sounded. Anyway, this was kind of a pointless story, but its a memory that has always lingered in the back of my mind.",

I thought they were filmed in colour back in the day but mastered and broadcast in black and white originally, then remastered in colour. Whoever did the colorisation did a great job.",

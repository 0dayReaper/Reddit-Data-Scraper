It completely changed how we (and the kids) saw Logan, since we had only ever since him from the kid\u2019s PoV as a business tyrant. Meanwhile Connor never cared about the business so he got to enjoy those magic moments with his father.",

I think it did a really good job of explaining the actual train of thought of Chefs in a certain echelon of the industry. Quite simply the customers inability to be adventurous ruins the possibility of practicing one\u2019s art. Unfortunately this attitude can permeate as deeply to the mozzarella sticks dunking crowd, wherein it really only should belong in .25% of the industry",

It shows or is at least mentioned the other three kids did play games with Logan similar to what we saw in that home video. And whilst Conor did get to enjoy those moments, he plainly says he doesn\u2019t think Logan even liked him and the guy was on a flight missing his wedding after all. The finale does not change how anyone sees Logan. We saw everything we needed to about him in the shows run.\n\nEdit: spelling",

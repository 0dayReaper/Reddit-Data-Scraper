I remember listening to Stephen Merchant on Conan Needs a Friend and he said one of the main reasons he and Ricky chose Greg Daniels to adapt the American version was because he was the only one who understood that, at its core, the show is a love story between Jim and Pam. To them that was the most important part of the show to get right. I'm not sure how licensing and all that works and maybe they didn't have as much of a say, but it's interesting that their relationship was allowed to take more of a back seat in the German adaption.",

The network at first even claimed the show was a wholly original idea. But by season 2 they added the \"Based on The Office\" in the credits and reached an agreement with Gervais for licensing etc.",

It's a French Canadian series from Quebec that by most accounts wasn't very good, only ran for 13 episodes and as far as I can tell it was never shown on any major Canadian TV stations. It also ran in direct competition with the US version which was still in it's early seasons so that probably didn't help either.",

The actor who played the boss really got the cringe-humor part of the series but most did not I feel like. I don't think the audience was ready for that at that time. It's pretty close to the US version but with very out of place, crammed-in sex jokes. Probably due to Anne-Marie Losique being a producer (she was branching out of sex/sexy TV shows at that time).",

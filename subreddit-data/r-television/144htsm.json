Then came Padma who was an incredible step up in quality but I was always so impressed by her genuine poise, calmness and grace a person and even as a young adult I aspired to carry myself like that one day. She\u2019s obviously a very beautiful woman (and so was the previous host) but her distinct aura is beyond her physical beauty and was a big plus for the show. She\u2019s still one of my favorite TV hosts ever and I\u2019ll watch her in anything she does next.",

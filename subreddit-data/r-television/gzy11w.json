They've produced a few good shows, such as Yellowstone (from the creator of Sicario and Hell or High Water) and Waco (which has been a hit on Netflix). They still have Bar Rescue, I believe.",

I was certain that not every person who died \"had it coming\" for being stupid, arrogant, amoral, etc, as the show made it appear. It's definitely that Old School Slasher movie moral code, where they seem to make the deaths look like they were well deserved. Sorry, but a dude dying because he lost circulation from tying a big sausage to his inner leg to make it appear that he had a big dick isn't amusing or well deserved. It's just sad and pathetic.",

He told me that before I could get my registration or anything I'd have to spell my name out.\n\nTwo letters in the dude starts giving me a weird look and getting pissed off. 19 letters later this dude was livid. His response was literally \"that name is fake as fuck you're going to jail. Out of the car.\" and blah blah he says there is no way my name is real. So at this time I'm 16 or 17, I have my 13 year old brother with me and his friend. After a while my little brother came out of the car and the cop started yelling at him to get back in and stuff, but my brother was holding all of the papers he could find with my name on them, my registration, insurance etc. Cop finally decides to take a look, then decides to call in and get a background check, after that, like an hour later, he lets me go.\n\nWith a speeding ticket for going 70 in a 60, which I got overturned in court because it was literally where it changes from 60-70.",

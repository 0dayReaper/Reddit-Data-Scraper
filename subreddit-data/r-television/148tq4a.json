Though, admittedly, it would seem a tall task to make compelling tv out of what is essentially a series of short stories with time jumps.\n\nFor anyone that has read the books, have you enjoyed the show?\n\nPerhaps this is better enjoyed by going in excited to see a new sci Fi tale rather than a faithful adaptation of a book?",

I had just discovered the books a few months before the show came out and was quite upset with the actual storyline the show took, as it seemed to preempt certain massive reveals and missed a lot of the philosophical nuance. Not saying if you loved the books you can't love the show, there is a lot to like in it. Just that it has made some pretty big decisions about how it presents that storyline which has a significant impact on the philosophical outlook of the recreation. Unfortunately it's been awhile and I think I'd need to watch it again to really flesh out those points, and I don't think I will.",

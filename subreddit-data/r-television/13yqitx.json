I'm assuming they will get to a point where there is more evidence against him, but so far it's just recordings illegally made by this reporter that, from what they've played, could have been innocent statements made by Jared while he's discussing kids regarding his talks he gives with his foundation edited together with this reporter's questions made to sound like he's talking about sexual stuff. \n\nLike I said, I'm just talking about what they've shown so far, but this is halfway through the entire series so far. From other people's comments, it sounds like there will be full self contained statements he makes that incriminates himself. \n\nIt's a very slow paced documentary, where they keep repeating the same things over and over. At this point I'm too committed to stop watching though. I keep waiting for them to reveal something damning.",

That's the 2nd worst UI in streaming but at least I was sorting through content that's interesting to me. Max is doing nothing to show you content you like, it's a catalog of garbage you need to fight through to find anything relevant to your taste because they know doing that would result in 90% of the Discovery content never being recommended to users.",

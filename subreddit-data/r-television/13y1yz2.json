A super tight production, sound design, direction, characters, and an absolute monolith with guest stars you'd absolutely never expect to see. \n\nIt's a shame even just to search Dave on this subreddit, and see that every post relating to it gets absolutely no attention, just as this one ultimately will, but hey, I'm taking the time regardless because even if just ONE person that would have never watched this show gives it a chance from this post, then totally worth it.",

I get it, he cant make up his mind about anything, and while it might explain why he hasnt dropped an IRL album in years, makes for a frustrating viewing experience. characters like that arent fun to root for, no matter if thats the point.\n\neven the best bit the show has done so far- the S2 finale with Gata- kinda went nowhere?

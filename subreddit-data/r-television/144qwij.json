            "comment": "I've liked the first 3 episodes overall, definitely slow at times. I've seen enough reviews that say it's only slow for the first 5 episodes and then gets a lot better the back half of the series. The production quality is good, Apple shows usually are though. I think the acting and cinematography have been good so far, the writing isn't the strongest but episode 3 was the best out of them. I also know nothing about what the show is based on, so I can understand the criticism some people have said about knowing what the mystery is and then the show being too slow to get there, which apperantly happens in episode 6. But as someone who doesn't know it's probably a bit more enjoyable.\n\nStill not sure if I'll watch weekly or just binge it when it's all done.",

The pacing of this in the early episodes is just right -- on the brink of feeling overwhelming, but not completely defeating. Something comes through for him at the very last minute. I also enjoy that Danny is an unreliable narrator, and I think that justifies some of the fast transitions / cuts in the storytelling.\n\nI also like the stark contrast between general awareness of mental health in 70s and now, when it feels like there is less stigma with talking it than ever. \n\nThe show feels like a work of literary fiction put on screen and I think the dialogue + acting could be better, but it's not *that* bad. I don't see what many people seem to not like about it.",

Apparently the pilot is the weakest episode, but poor acting doesn't really get fixed so easily. \n\nI'm usually easy to please, but I am gonna stop midway throw the pilot and call it quits",

Atleast, that's just my opinion. I'm no expert, but I thought he was acting the part very well in the episodes I've watched. \n\nI really like the show overall. Episodes 2 and 3 are definitely better than the 1st, but I didn't hate the first either. \n\nAlso, glad to see more Emma Laird. She was great in Mayor of Kingstown.",

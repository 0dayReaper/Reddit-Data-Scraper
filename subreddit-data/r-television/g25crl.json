However, the easiest one for non-norwegian ones to attempt goes something like this.\n\nSidenote: This dialect uses a similar 'r' as the Irish one, so trying to say it with an exaggerated Irish r yields the best result. \n\nGry is pronounced similar to the 'gri' in agriculture, but with a longer i, as if agriculture had two i's.\n\nMolv\u00e6r is a two-syllable word where mol sounds similar to the mol in molten. 'V\u00e6r' however is a bit harder, as the '\u00e6' sounds doesn't really exist in English. The most similar one would be the noise you make when you say 'bastard' in standard American, in between B and s. Now switch out the B in bastard with a v, as if it rhymes. Now instead of finishing the word, put in that Irish r again. And combining we get mol-va-r, or molvaer.\n\nHivju is probably the easiest, as the correct pronunciation is very similar to saying heave you, but faster, as if you could combine the two, heav'you.\n\nHope this helps a little!\nLove from Norway",

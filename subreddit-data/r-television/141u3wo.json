That's how the show is designed. They get experience and visibility and then move on to other projects. This also allows the show to continually tap young, new talent and stay relevant to the current time. \n\nSome turn out to not be a good fit for the show and move on quickly. But most cast members tend to stick around for a few years.",

Like this passage\n\n\"And as comedian Kerry Coddett pointed out, not only did the show go for long stretches without Black women in the cast, it often handed them roles that traded on demeaning stereotypes. Yvonne Hudson, who worked at SNL in the 1980\u201381 season, played \u201ca maid, a nurse, a slave,\u201d writes Coddett. Danitra Vance, \u201ca classically trained Shakespearean actor who also performed at the famed Second City Theater,\u201d had two recurring roles. One was Cabrini Green Jackson, \u201ca 17-year- old welfare mother who gave advice about pregnancy. In another sketch, \u2018That Black Girl,\u2019 Vance plays LaToya Marie, a black actress who will do anything to get famous.\u201d Vance only lasted one season in part \u201cbecause she resented routinely being cast as a maid or a prostitute,\u201d according to a story written at the time of her 1994 death.\"\n\nWow there were racial stereotypes 42 years ago?

It used to actually be counter culture and now it's just so bland.\n\nThe first season of I Think You Should Leave is the best sketch comedy we've had in years and a lot of it were skits that SNL turned down.\n\nAnd going onto the SNL sub is bizarre, it's populated with people who seem to get offended by the smallest things. Which is usually the antithesis of a comedy audience but I guess it speaks to how anodyne the show has become.\n\nAnother things that speaks to the dullness of modern SNL is how they fired Shane Gillis over a comedy routine and he then went on to make skits that are not only funnier than anything SNL has put out since but also shows him to be a better actor and comedic performer than the current cast.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wTCZTbWJa1I\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HotDJ2FhB84\n\nhttps://youtu.be/INGWryuvMX4\n\nedit: i wrote this in a reply but might as well put it here: Kate McKinnon in character as Hillary Clinton playing Hallelujah after the election without any sort of joke.

We only remember the good stuff so we think it used to be so much better, but its about the same, overall.  There are some seasons and casts that are better than others, but those also vary in quality and change over time.\n\nBottom line is that people have been complaining about how bad SNL is for decades and the seasons they use to point out \"the good years\" always seem to shift depending on who is doing the complaining.  10 years from now people will be whining about the (then) current seasons and talking about how this seasons airing right now were the last good seasons.  It is a predictable and never ending cycle.  Much like people complain that music sucks now and stuff from 10 years ago was so much better, completely forgetting that 10 years ago they were complaining about the music coming out and saying the stuf 10 years before that was so much better.",

Even when they are trying to be 'out there' now, it's always done in an extremely safe way.\n\nThe two big things that show what a completely different beast the show is today is having Kate McKinnon in character as Hillary Clinton playing Hallelujah after the election without any dort of joke.

In fact there was pushback for his referring to \"bitches\" in his SNL monologue. \n\n\nYou're just moving the goalpost because your point is shit.

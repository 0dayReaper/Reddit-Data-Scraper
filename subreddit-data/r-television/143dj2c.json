            "comment": "&gt; Tim Hanlon, CEO of media consultancy Vertere Group and a previous consultant for FAST service Pluto TV, envisions a world in which, say, Amazon\u2019s recently concluded The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel ends up on such a platform in the future: \u201cLogic would dictate that it\u2019s time to figure out how to further monetize that show, now that its first run is done.\u201d\n\nThis wouldn't annoy me if it wasn't an exclusivity thing. If, say, Warner Bros Discovery wants to double dip on Westworld that's fine, but pulling it from the main service that I pay $20 a month for specifically to avoid ads and making it only available in the most annoying context of an ad supported, non on demand service is just nonsense.  \n\nFurther, if they care about remonetizing these series after they wrap up, there is an easy way to do that: Let me buy these shows. Physical media, digital via iTunes or Amazon, I don't care how, but locking these shows away until you decide to toss them to a free service is bullshit. Right now you can't legally watch Snowpiercer in the US. It's not on streaming anywhere, it's not available for digital purchase, and the Amazon and Best Buy pages for the physical DVD releases both say 'unavailable' without any indication that they will ever be available again. VPNs won't help you here thanks to Netflix's crackdown on password sharing, good luck trying to stream something while 'in' the UK when your account is linked to a physical location in the US. \n\nThis sucks, but I can kind of get why they're behaving like this. The issue is that there are a lot of ways that they could make this suck a lot less for consumers, some of us who don't want to resort to piracy in order to watch a TV show, but these companies are just refusing to do those things that would make this suck less.",

You provide people with convenient, accessible ways of viewing content and even those who pirate like myself would feel more inclined to pay.",

Blueray releases were also made.\n\nThe third season came out and was on streaming, but about six months after it finished it was taken off of streaming and no blueray release of this season was ever made.\n\nThere is no legal way to view season 3 in America at the minute. It is streaming in a few places internationally but will be removed from those at the end of the year.\n\nReason? License owners of the show do not want to pay residuals to the creators of the show and so have just opted to vault the show away in the form of a tax write-off.\n\n[The creator of that show got really fucked over and it's terrible.](https://movieweb.com/final-space-creator-to-conclude-series-with-independent-graphic-novel/#:~:text=Olan%20Rogers%2C%20the%20creator%20of,story%20as%20a%20graphic%20novel.&amp;text=In%20September%20of%202022%2C%20Final,merger%20of%20WarnerMedia%20and%20Discovery.)\n\nScrew the whole industry. If it dies because I'm pirating, so be it. Deserves what it gets.",

Like, okay, I'm all for the argument that piracy is often times justified because official platforms suck or delist titles, I've been there. But at some point these companies decide they are not content with the money they are making, and want more. And more. And more. At some point, it becomes stupid and unreasonable.\n\nNo one is leaving Netflix right now because the service is bad, it's pretty decent, certainly better than having to torrent shows or whatever. But Netflix was worth the fraction of the subscription I was sharing with my family to me, now they want the full amount and I'm just not interested at that price. \n\nYou can't have infinite growth and infinite money but capitalism demands it. Companies cannot survive the capitalist system that they themselves used to rise to the top. Once they are up there, they are forced to cut corners or make stupid decisions. It's a constant and something that *needs* fixing at a systemic level. Our entire society is running into a wall right now and has been for decades.",

Aka, owning a business to make money, and hiring workers (as opposed to ownership partners). Both of those are fine and don't create the dumpster fire that's going on here. *This* is caused by shareholder capitalism specifically. Privately owned companies can exist just fine by simply making more than they spend, without the need for infinite growth. That's only the case for companies that depend on stock investment, because shareholders demand ROI (aka, their stock must go up, aka company must grow). Consistent profit isn't enough because stagnant stocks aren't valuable traded commodities.",

Most people are comfortable with working for a safe wage without risk of coming up empty if the company suffers, and on the flip side, the owners are comfortable risking the big losses to get the big rewards.\n\nRegardless, I'm a big fan of private business, especially small business.

They recently put out an update that forcefully installs a launcher that actively monitors my system, ruins performance, and disables what I consider to be key features of a single player only PC game (file editing, memory scanning, etc.). So I pirated it. I pirated a game I already own because they created such a terrible experience.\n\nThis also has caused me to recommend to others that *don\u2019t* own the game to pirate as well, and I even recommend safe sites to do so because they deserve a good experience while playing the game.",

But while her loss isn\u2019t a financial one, 'Earth to Ned' can no longer serve as a calling card to help land future gigs for Skinner, **who also doesn\u2019t own a physical copy of the show.** \n\n&gt; **\u201cIt\u2019s part of this overall mindset of the value of art and creativity that like, \u2018Wow, you spent all this time on this, then you at least deserve a phone call,'\u201d Skinner,** who has been picketing with fellow Writers Guild members, tells The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cYou at least deserve to understand a little bit what\u2019s happening with your work. But it\u2019s a whole climate of devaluing.\u201d\n\n\n&gt; **During a May 10 earnings call, Disney CFO Christine McCarthy announced that it would be \u201cremoving certain content from streaming platforms.\u201d** The company, which has been undergoing rolling layoffs, disclosed in a securities filing on June 2 that it would take a $1.5 billion write-down from the axed programming. **More content is expected to disappear in the third quarter.**",

They'd wind up giving extra shares to the creators (Disney Movies shares disappear, so they've effectively evaporated leaving the creators with a larger percentage of the show) and they'd still get taxed on any of the money that the movie makes afterward.

So instead of recognizing $30m in expense all at once today, they recognize $1m of expense per month.\n\nIf no one is watching the show and it isn't providing value, they can choose to write-off the asset sooner and realize whatever expense is left immediately. May result in lower taxes this year but they don't get to reduce their income in the next two as they had planned. And no matter what, they paid the $36m for the show.\n\nNo business sets out wanting to impair assets...Disney is doing this because D+ is not performing as they thought it would and it has resulted in their share price dropping significantly. It sucks for consumers / creators of content and I don't know why a company has to remove content to take a write-off if they can prove viewership of it is very low.",

They already own it on steam.\n\nIf I'm accessing my games though a subscription though, then Xbox Game Pass can pull those titles whenever they want, and I have to go into the store and buy it to keep playing.\n\nSubscription allows you to double dip in a way digital purchases don't.\n\n2: There was a point in time where EA pulled all of its games from Steam. Why? Because EA was trying to create their own platform Origin.\n\nSteam was so hugely profitable that it became cheaper to sell your games through Steam, Epic, Origins and GOG than just on Origins alone.\n\nHowever the reason this happens is because Steam doesn't sign exclusivity deals in the same way Epic Games or Netflix was. They treat it like retail.\n\nIf you want to sign a deal to get into the biggest gaming store (steam), you can keep selling to any other store front you want.\n\nIf you want to sign a deal to get into Netflix at it's prime, you get stuck into an exclusive contract and can't sell to other streaming services.",

If there's no copyright then *no one* gets paid: not studios, not producers, not writers, not actors, not directors. It would also cause a huge issue companies and entities can still profit off of uncopyrighted material in ways that the creative would probably disagree with. At least with writing it off and removing and keeping the copyright there's still a chance that it could become available in the future.",

Hopefully they get watched enough they work on getting the eighties series as well.\n\nThing is that is part of the problem.  The business models and payouts evolved around temporal available by broadcasting.   The model need to change more to a pay per view for streaming.  People like the idea of a large back catalogue library being available that they can go watch some show they learn about reading a comment thread. You may discover a something and want to see other related works.   With streaming we should be able to.  It seems more that the financial model has failed to adapt as of yet, so it should be a solvable problem and people are right to complain about it.\n\nEdit: looks like the original series is available on prime",

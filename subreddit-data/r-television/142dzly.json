Felt too much like it was trying to be Deadwood in the Caribbean, which sounds great on paper and I love Deadwood, but the dialogue in Black Sails is incredibly bad and the performances aren't much better.  Deadwood on the other hand had superbly crafted dialogue and was littered with great thespian actors.",

And then what?  Okay then they are just normal people again?\n\nThe reasons for people being against severance were never explored.   And they never actually explained what the corporation was doing.  \n\nI was extremely disappointed in the ending in that you never found out what the number sorting actually was, which i thought was the main mystery.   \n\nWhy did they keep the departments separate? We dont know. \n\nJust so much to explore that they didnt.",

I guess I enjoyed it as a great start to a series, I wasn't necessarily expecting everything to be answered in S1.  But if those questions don't get answered in subsequent seasons then it will indeed harm my opinion of the first season in retrospect.  I'm hoping the second season delivers, but with the strike going on there's no telling when we'll get it... perhaps in 2025 :(",

Cult45 is a criminal organization and should be dealt with by the full power of the law.\n\nEdit: Why would you just assume I supported Obama or all of his actions? Some of the stuff he did I didn\u2019t agree with. Some I agreed with. But that\u2019s the point, it\u2019s on a case by case basis. I just don\u2019t blindly think something is right or good because Obama said so. Hell, I caucused for Ron Paul in 2012 after I voted for Obama in 2008. Ya know why? Because I DIDN\u2019T BLINDLY FOLLOW SOMEONE. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a team game to win the conference championship. This shit is real and it has far reaching consequences. This abuse of power cult45 is taking part in is just plain wrong and against everything our constitution and separation of powers was meant to be. You follow your dear leader no matter how wrong he is and just regurgitate talking points spewed to you during that \u201cnews\u201d cast you watch. Wake up.",

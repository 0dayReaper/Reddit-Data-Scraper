            "comment": "There are two points there: \n\n1. The costs of a deal for Apple are basically none. I doubt they're an issue within AMPTP, but I also don't think they have much of a voice inside to instigate a deal, as AppleTV+ costs are minimal for the company and they don't have to deal with complex waste issues like the traditional studios or streamings with a lot of content.  \n\n2. Apple doesn't like unions, and so far it's been pretty generous with talent (renewing almost every show and giving greenlight to original non-IP projects). I strangely enjoy listening to quarterly shareholders meetings and no investor has ever worried about spending on TV and film content (again, it's a big nothing for them). But won't they lose patience if TV+ stuff gets in the way of Apple's big moment of the past decade (AR/VR headset)? Just as costs don't matter to them, doing away with AppleTV+ won't matter either.",

In regards to their streaming business, I remember when no one took them seriously when they started invading the space, even before launch, when rumors of their interest in the entertainment industry as a whole had been flying for years. Look at them now. It\u2019s a bit shocking, somewhat incredible if you understand just how quickly they cemented themselves with the other giants.\n\nTheir aggressive approach to amassing content can be compared to early days of Netflix\u2019s strategy, except it\u2019s much difficult because the space is now dominated by established players all competing against each other. I have no doubt they lost considerable amount of money to reach this level, in fact, I bet they\u2019re still losing money. Does this matter? Yes, sort of. But at endgame? No. It\u2019s all about cash flow and imaginary assets and its skyrocketing value that allows one giant to eat another giant. Think of it like agar.io\n\nThe greatest weapon in Apple\u2019s arsenal is their trusted brand image. Of course, they got resources like the fuck you money, but because of how quickly they were able to attract talent\u2014the great actors, writers, directors, et cet\u2014they were able to amass quite a catalog in such short amount of time. These quality shows only boost their brand image, and now everyone wants to get in on Apple\u2019s streaming catalog because it means something. Apple in their current position could technically be the assholes and say \u201cif you don\u2019t want to work with us, that\u2019s fine because there are plenty of talent that do\u201d. Regardless of how this plays out, I do think Apple and WGA should come together in agreement because once Apple folds, the rest will follow suit.",

Sure, Apple won't be hurt financially, but it's pretty clear they want AppleTV to be successful, and it's going to be *really* difficult to retain subscribers if they aren't adding anything new and don't have much of a library otherwise.\n\nI also doubt that Apple will be the first domino to fall since they obviously have a lot more they can fall back on unlike, say, Paramount or WBD, but it doesn't really make sense for the WGA to not put pressure on as many of the companies as they can.  While certain studios are definitely going to be more impacted than others, there's no reason to spare one of the companies and allow them to feel like they have no need to come to the table to negotiate.",

The biggest thing they're missing at this point is, unlike most of the other streamers, not having any sort of production arm and the library that brings with it, and they license most of their content instead (*For All Mankind* - Sony, *Mythic Quest* - Lionsgate, *Shrinking* - WB, etc.).  Hell, if they wanted to be Netflix, they probably could just buy Netflix.\n\nI think it's more about horizontal expansion and them wanting their fingers in as many pies as possible in tech.  They're trying to lure people in with quality and word-of-mouth rather than being an \"everything for everyone\" sort of service like Netflix.",

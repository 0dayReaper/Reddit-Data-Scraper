Nate returning to the team, soccer, Ted, other plot points. I feel like Keeley got way too much time with basically nothing coming out of it. The finale was great and wrapped up everything, but the writers fell into the trap of rushing things in the last two episodes.",

The only part that I really liked was her friendship with the office manager lady, which had a definite progression, as both of them grew.\n\nBy the end of the season, I found myself invested in Jamie and Nate, but that was about it.",

Did he get promoted back to a coach?!&lt; Overall, I think the ending hit the right emotional notes, but this is one of those few shows that ended with you wanting more episodes [or maybe even another whole season].",

So many events on and off the pitch happen off screen or get focus in one episode and then barely get mentioned again. \n\nS2 was a drop in quality from S1 but the season was still overall good. S3 however was so much weaker than S2 that it sticks out big time. This season has been a bunch of disconnected episodes without any clear narrative flow and in my opinion this was not at all a satisfying end to the show at all. \n\nI'll still watch an inevitable Richmond spin off but this was not the way this amazing show deserved to go. I have a feeling the show got too popular so the creators tried dumbing down so many elements to appeal to a wider audience which is why the football stuff feels both so cartoony and also irrelevant. So irrelevant in fact that they can't even be bothered showing us in the moment who wins the league.",

Season 1 understood this well, the next two drifted further and further away from this until it was basically just a side distraction until it was like \"oh, hey, and by the way, they might win the Premier League\".",

They got relegated because Ted is out of his depth and it works so well. \n\nThen we have S2 where they storm through the league off screen doing a near impossible streak of wins, and then we have S3 where for no reason whatsoever they're competing for the title even though Ted is still completely out of his depth. \n\nFirst season relegated, second season promotion, third season should have been survival and winning the FA Cup by beating West Ham.",

Just a checklist one after the other with no regard for connecting any of it. The closest we got was Colin's storyline and lo and behold it was the best storyline in the entire season. Remember early S3 with Zava? Sam beefing on twitter with the politician? Even Keeley and the leaks, it's all stuff that barely came up again and didn't have any consequence on the wider narrative. \n\nWhen they so easily could have had for example Sam growing more disgruntled with the political stuff, show how that effects him over the international break without playing for his country, show racial abuse which then leads to the club supporting him, ultimately maybe he steps up as captain when McAdoo is absent. All that over a season rather than one fucking episode dedicated to a few tweets.",

I wish that would\u2019ve happened when he officially asked to come back\n\n-in the finale it\u2019s clear that Michelle/Henry are invested in the match while Dr Jacob is just fucking around on his phone\u2026 I would\u2019ve liked to get a proper removal of Dr Jacob given that he probably could\u2019ve lost his license given his underhandedness.\n\nAlso, I really didn\u2019t appreciate the Jamie/Keely/Roy resolution. I\u2019m fine if we don\u2019t explicitly see Keely and Roy reunite, but to essentially do away with that because of Jamie v. Roy felt like old ground we re-trod for no earned reason.",

He could literally pay her $10m to move to ENG in order for him to have his cake and eat it to by having his family be with him as he stays the manager of the team. I get that doesn't really fit with how the story played out and I'm not saying I'd want that, but the logic of him having to go home for family when he was offered that much money created a logic-hole, the cousin to the loop-hole.!&lt;\n\nThe writing for S3 could have been much better, in terms of which characters and story lines got how much attention. The Nate return from the dark side was going at the right pace and then all of a sudden, bam, absolutely everyone is great with him. That could have used another episode at least worth of scenes where he is earning the forgiveness of the players. Keeley got a LOT of screen time for not much actual story. I'm really happy that we didn't get any answer as to Ted's love life and I'm not saying I wanted Keeley to pick one of the guys when they gave her the ultimatum, but it ending with it all up in the air was kinda lame. \n\nI would absolutely watch a spin-off about the AFC Womens Team. Just saying. I wouldn't want another season or a spin-off of the mens team, as much as I like those characters, the show was special with Ted and his positivity at the center of it. But Rebecca, Keeley, Higgins and the story of starting a womens team from scratch, coaching them, and them playing games would be a lot of fun if the writing was good. \n\nI really hope I see more of the actor who played Trent and the actor who played Danny in other projects.

It's all great trusting your writers, but the cutting room floor exists for a reason. Not every scene is a good scene, and too much bloat is *definitely* a bad thing. I reject the idea that any of the episodes ever needed to be more than 40 minutes at maximum, and even that is pushing it. \n\nTed Lasso was a great show whose final season overindulged, and now I struggle recommending it since so much of S3 is poor filler.",

Jack just kinda came and went with little to no lasting consequences, and that Sam story was basically his last big one of the show.  Hell that one would\u2019ve been really neat to have over a couple episodes at least.\n\nThough the football has kinda always been offscreen, and again with the hour long episodes it felt like we got a bit more of it here towards the end.\n\nI\u2019ll also say Nate\u2019s heel turn didn\u2019t feel invalidated at all.  It definitely felt very quick for the team to come back to him like that, but all it would\u2019ve taken was seeing them react to what he did on their own and talking though it.

All of the schmaltz, all the hard work, all the everything over 3 seasons and the team still didn\u2019t win it all. WTF.\n\nAnd (2) everyone showed so much feeling about and towards Ted for leaving. Everyone was so grateful, so emotional, so thankful and Ted just seemed\u2026detached? Like markedly less emotionally invested. Never shed a tear, or shared a real moment with anyone that demonstrated that he felt anything more than \u201coh bless your heart\u201d to the family he had over the last 3 years. Just more preaching at his team, one liners with the Diamond Dogs, barely uttered a word any time Rebecca poured her heart out to him. It was\u2026a choice. \n\nThen it made me rewind back and examine Ted\u2019s posturing and it seems that he has so much kindness to give but truly never seemed that emotionally invested in his situation. He brought them together but never really got close to his team, had sweet but largely superficial relationships with his friends. He never cared about winning, rarely strategized, never gave a damn about what all this could mean for his life. He was there to help everyone find themselves, deepen and solidify relationships, yet none of that really happened for Ted. Sure he went to therapy, worked through the shit with his dad, confronted his mom, all very good to see. But even in how he interacted with his therapist it was so paternalistic and god complex-like, and that was no different than how he interacted with his team and his colleagues. \n\nHis arc wasn\u2019t about finding his way back to his son, either. In S1 he ran off the pitch in the middle of training to embrace his son. He\u2019s always cared deeply for Henry. And yes, supporting characters are always going to be more interesting and wackier than the main, but Ted was interesting and wacky too. For him to remain essentially unaffected by the incredible change he experienced by moving to a foreign country, teaching a foreign sport after a divorce\u2014I just expected more for and from Ted. I would have loved to see Ted grow as character. I would have loved to see Ted invest in where he was planted and actually _blossom_. I would have loved to see Ted actually learn about and give a shit about football. I would have loved to see him stop obsessing over Michelle and actually open his heart to someone or something real. I just didn\u2019t get any of that from Ted except for his \u201cbe a goldfish\u201d and other preachy lines. I\u2019ll probably be downvoted for most of this but I loved this show and am really disappointed with where it ended, for multiple reasons, but especially in where it went with Ted. I guess it just wasn\u2019t that type of show.",

Rebecca in a relationship, Roy as a coach, Keeley's office (barely explored) and especially the women's team at Richmond can all make for good stories, new characters and a fresh air for the show.",

Them wanting to be treated equally with the nickname could even be a running theme. It allows you to bring back any of the shows characters when needed while allowing a whole new \"world\" to be built alongside the existing one.\n\nMaybe have one of the lesser featured male players get injured and become an assistant Coach as a link between the two. Colin blowing out his ACL because of a tackle in training from Isaac and coming to terms with not being a top level footballer anymore while helping the women players could be interesting.\n\nColin tries to fill the gap playing gives him by partying and travelling, left empty etc etc. Isaac's sister is on the team, but not starting, but doesn't feel Isaac will understand what she is going through as he has always been one of the first names on the teamsheet. She goes to Colin for advice given his history of not always being seen as a top tier player, knowing him well through Isaac, and boom, Colin and Isaacs unnamed sister start their journey. Rebecca has hired a top tier female manager for the team, who initially rejects Colin's request to help out, dismissing him as a bored footballer. I could go on and on.\n\nThere's a million ways they could go with it, this is just one very poor attempt at fleshing it out. I hope it's something they explore.\n\nI may have to waste some time writing this all out now, I've got a whole world built in my head.\n\nEDIT : Higgins enjoying being a father figure to the team, as he only has sons. Honestly I'm now going to be pissed if they don't make this spin-off.",

Season two started focusing more and more on side characters, and three felt like a straight up ensemble show. I think both seasons suffered for it.

I'll go further than you and say that they'll even get Jason back. This is the streamer that gets Harrison Ford and Meryl Streep, often to do some real bad shows/movies. They can afford to make Jason Sudeikis an offer he can't refuse.\n\nI think maybe we'll get two shows. \"Ted Lasso\" or something like that continues with Ted stateside coaching soccer. Like maybe he coaches an MLS team (Apple has the MLS broadcast rights, perfect synergy) or even the national team, you can have people from the main show pop in whenever. Then you could do \"Welcome to Richmond\" about everyone back at home. The women's team sounds like the perfect premise for that.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, it certainly won't be anywhere near as good as the original show which was writing and character driven for the most part vs a cash grab, but I would almost guarantee they won't give up on this after only 3 seasons.",

Also, why is everyone so forgiving with Nate? That dude was a piece of shit. I'm fine with a redemption arc, but not one that takes place over 2.5 episodes and a rough apology. It was an ok season, but there was no story at all.",

The 30 minute format suited the show perfectly as it could keep the snappiness of a 22 min sitcom but also slow down for 2-3 serious scenes per episode.  The 45+ minute episode length dragged on and on, and even then the writers seemed unwilling to several key scenes, focusing on minutiae and fan service.\n\nI hope this is a lessen to show runners, just write more episodes and have them all fit the same time format.  Good writing requires killing your darlings, no one would have minded a 20 episode season either.\n\nOverall, a solid B ending, only disappointing because the first season was an A.",

            "comment": "Season 3 was, frankly speaking, a mess. Every episode felt like it was pulled mid-season from a different show. Not much of a season storyline to be honest, and the sap was really getting a bit heavyhanded. Nate's storyline and the forgiveness angle was definitely the most interesting but it was very inconsistent and a bit extreme without much of an actual arc in comparison to the turn to the darkside arc of the prior season. Keeley dominated a lot of the screen time with very little actually behind it and no true resolution. Some new characters were introduced and came and went without doing much but wasting time.  \n\nAlso, the show became way too reliant on \"these masculine professional athletes actually have quite the feminine side, how ironic huh?\" as its go-to-gag topped off with the players putting on a Mary Poppins performance for whatever reason. Once I noticed it, I couldn't unsee it.\n\nAs a series finale, it was pretty good though, so hopefully they don't continue with the show minus Ted Lasso even though I suspect they probably will if the creatives are interested since it's a popular enough show. I dunno what the purpose of Rebecca selling 49 % of the team to the fans was, as the cynical side would say by retaining 51 % and the fans \"buying shares\" that don't actually come with anything, it's just a cash grab/fundraising thing, even though I think they tried to do something wholesome with it.",

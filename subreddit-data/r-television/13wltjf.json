I feel like part of the reason they killed him off is because they actually had plans to have Clark crossover from the Without Remorse film into the TV show. I doubt that was the case, but it would be interesting if they did do that. With Chavez getting his own TV show after Jack Ryan ends I could maybe see the producers using it as a way to bring him over into the Rainbow Six film. Without Remorse left a lot to be desired, but I kind of hope they do connect the TV shows and the film.",

If it were truly a matter of being able to pay them off, we would have taken that route. \n\n[Osama Bin Laden\u2019s](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver) letter regarding why he attacked the United States demonstrates how deeply ingrained his religious views were in perpetrating the attack. He and others like him hold sincere religious beliefs calling for Islam worldwide. \n\nTom Clancy\u2019s original stories were complex and nuanced where the writers of Jack Ryan are blunt and assume the watcher has the geopolitical understanding of a toddler. They are flashy but without substance. It\u2019s ok to like them just as it is ok to not like them, but this is why I stopped watching after season two.",

                            "comment": "This is actually a pretty typical narrative for copaganda/law enforcement/military media. The message almost always is that there are a few bad apples (even leadership), but they are a bug, not a feature of an overall good/necessary institution. At the end of the story, things go back to the way they were, but no one challenges the existence or foundational purpose of the CIA/FBI/police/military itself. No one is working for progress or change, just protecting the status quo from corrupt/violent individuals. The message is about conserving oppressive institutions of power that \"protect\" us. And ofc the hero is an action man, often a rogue/vigilante who glorifies armed violence.\n\nMarvel has \"rooting out corruption in law enforcement/military\" narratives from time to time and yet in exchange for the use of military equipment in their movies, they allow the military to review/approve scripts and they even collaborate with the military to create military recruitment ads.\n\nThis fantasy was in fact foundational to the white nationalist group the Oath Keepers. Their name allegedly (according to the founder's estranged ex-wife who was with him when he started Oath Keepers) comes from the idea that \"everyone\" who serves the gov - in particular people who serve in law enforcement and the military - take an oath to uphold the constitution. The Oath Keepers purportedly began with the idea that people in law enforcement/military would root out corruption among their ranks, like vigilantes, like all of these movies and tv series. Irl they were/are a group of armed, conspiratorial vigilante (terrorist) white nationalists, many of them with connections to law enforcement and the military. Lately, they have been on trial for storming the Capitol.\n\nAll that said, I have my \"problematic faves\". I enjoy Slow Horses and The Americans as much as the next person, which are themselves examples of what I just described.\n\nI see I'm downvoted but y'all can do your own research, this stuff is fairly well researched and reported on. In fact, Jack Ryan in particular has been widely criticized as being CIA propaganda lol.",

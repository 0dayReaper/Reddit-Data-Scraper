If you have watched the office for years, you don't learn too too much, and all of their questions they take from fans are \"was X ad libbed?\"\n\nTheir chemistry doesn't work well for podcasting and they go on tangents fairly often. They're obviously friends, but the pod itself is fairly weak unless they have a guest on. They really benefit from a 3rd person to cut in and add more than just 2 friends talking and making awkward banter.",

The first documentary series aired on TV (it aired on PBS fittingly enough) was *An American Family* from the early 70's, but continued checking in on the family which it followed into the 90's if I recall correctly.   \n  \nThis is also WAY better than a limpy reboot of the show, because I think it gives the writers and actors the opportunity to explore new pathways for storylines, something they were trying for in the waning seasons to near disastrous effect (Pam leaving Jim for Mic-Guy).  There would be enough time passed for characters to have believably changed, rather than jarring shifts over the span of a couple of episodes. If they were to follow different Dunder Mifflinites across the company in clusters, it could open up the possibility of multiple spin-offs down the road.  \n  \nWe could have Michael+Holly and fam in Colorado, PBJ + Darryl in Texas, Dwight and some coworkers in Scranton. With enough care and planning, these spin-offs could be far more promising compared to the Schrute Farms spinoff which sprung almost out of nowhere. Then we'd have my dream timeline with an established The Office Cinematic Universe, and then I could die happy in my chair with my body illuminated by the glow of my TV playing the T.O.C.U. on repeat. Fuck it, since Parks and Rec is out there, maybe we see an possible marriage/wedding of the two series in some way. And as we all know, Webster's Dictionary defines wedding \"the fusing of two metals with a hot torch.\"",

He would get a bunch of the gang back together to be his campaign team and they are constantly trying to stop him from doing the controversial stuff he is known to do. There would be an episode where he tries to get Oscar to support his campaign as a senator but he just can't. There would be obvious parallels to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe biggest issue with this concept is that it has been done to death lately.",

IASIP on the other hand gets away with tons of politically incorrect shit, and always has, because the comedy comes not from the offensive material, but from laughing at how stupid &amp; awful the characters are that they think that stuff is ok (e.g. Dee's Latina character, Mac doing blackface, etc).",

You should look for some, some can be quite good. \n\nI personally worked for one in my country and kinda didn't like it, it felt liks closing your eyes before reality and as every news site they are also driven by clicks and advertisements, so they will use click bait too. But hey click bait in a positive way.",

Always thought it was a very inspired one-off, especially for the time.",

I don't care how much I like someone, if it turns out that they eat people, then I might not want to have anything to do with them ever again.",

The exception of bones and sleepy hollow, that whole thing lasted two whole episodes on two different shows was definitely the definition of tv crossover.\n\nAny celebrity getting possessed by a demon in supernatural was always a cameo to me, someone showing up for 4-5 seconds or a segment (commercial - commercial) on another show, cameo. And lets be honest, it makes sense, why wouldn't a celebrity (and let's be real, especially one on an MTV Reality Show) make a deal with the crossroads demon for fame, wealth and success. I just fits the theme of the show that Snookie made a deal with the devil to get her on Jersey Shore ESPECIALLY at the time when people were making fun on the show and wondering how this got aired.\n\nBUT when Steve Urkle hurtled through time and space to be on Step by Step, Full House, and I think Boy Meets World (it's been a while since I saw that live as a kid), that's a crossover event.\n\nI think mainstream has definitely started using \"crossover\" as a media ploy to get people to watch what would have been considered a cameo in the past, and blending the terms. So now, we get \"FAMILY GUY/BONES CROSSOVER\" and it's just a dream with Stewie in it for less than 15 seconds, which would have been a cameo at a previous point in time.\n\nI know this is a semantics argument, truly, but I'm just wondering when we lost the word cameo?\n\nThe phrase if you are wanting to google are: cameo role, cameo appearance, shortened to cameo.",

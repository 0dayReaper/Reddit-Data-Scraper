He was playing the lead ghoul, but I don\u2019t know how big a part that role actually is, I was excited when I thought he was the main character but am less now.\n\nThough the idea of a Justified style show set in the Fallout universe between him and Timothy Olyphant does sound pretty awesome. Though I would want the roles reversed just to see how they would play off each other then.",

Not only that, but the serialized parts of the story are still present in those episodes so they aren't existing in a vacuum. They are tools for telling us who these characters really are.\n\nAnd yet, the very first episode has the Miami \"justified\" cold open, gives us Boyd Crowder, gives us a great first appearance of Dewey Crow, etc etc. It's a stellar pilot, and there is no filler. In retrospect it's only weaker than other seasons because starting in S2 they expand the world building way more with the Bennetts, then Limehouse, Quarles, and so on.\n\nJustified is a different type of top tier show. It's not \"prestige\" like The Wire, but it's incredibly colorful with unbelievably engaging writing, memorable one-off characters, and, in a subtle way, has a lot more to say about its characters than any other show like it in tv history.",

I have been watching it on and off over the last few years and keep coming back it it. I will blitz through a season and then have to let it percolate for a while.\n\nI do agree with the other bloke in that it is a western style story but in modern times, and it has Timothy Olyphant playing his strongest character type, a gunslinging sheriff. So if you liked Deadwood that will be a huge plus.\n\nBut more than that, Olyphant and Goggins are great actors who control the scenes they are in and when they are playing off each other they are amazing.\n\nTo such an extent that I really want to watch a buddy cop movie with these two actors playing the partners.",

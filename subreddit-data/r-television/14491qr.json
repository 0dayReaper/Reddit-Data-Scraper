The basic concept of these young demi-gods running into all the greatest hits of Greek legend is great, but their interactions with those legends are pretty predictable. Even for younger readers I don't think the stories create enough suspense, Percy and his crew always blunder into legends they really should know about, but it rarely matters because those legends in turn are just running on the standard script and the answer to overcoming them tends to just fall into their laps. I always felt like if the Percy Jackson novels could just hold their suspense a bit longer and trust their readers to tolerate a bit of extended mystery they would have gotten a lot more respect.",

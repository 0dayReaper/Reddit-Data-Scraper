He was always so healthy and then a aneurism kills him suddenly it was so tough to go through. There's no warning no time yo process it just happens.\n\nLuckily we were able to donate his lungs, heart, liver and kidneys and his brain went to science. It was a silver lining knowing his organs saved 4 different peoples lives, It's what he would have wanted",

Statistically it\u2019s more around 50%. However, for the half that does survive, unfortunately 60% will have some permanent neurological deficit. \n\nIt is believed that 1 in 50 people have an un-ruptured aneurysm whether they\u2019re aware of it or not. Sounds like a lot, but that\u2019s only 2% of people. Most of these are small and only have a 50%-80% chance that they will NEVER rupture. \n\nAlthough it can unfortunately happen to anyone at any age, most aneurysms probably develop as a result of wear and tear on the arteries throughout a person\u2019s lifetime.\n\nEDIT: [Brain Aneurysm Foundation Website ](https://bafound.org/about-brain-aneurysms/brain-aneurysm-basics/brain-aneurysm-statistics-and-facts/) if you are curious where my statistics came from and a great website for resources!",

It should be noted that you still technically have had a brain aneurysm if a blood vessel in your brain expanded like a balloon but didn\u2019t rupture. (Grant obviously died of hemmorhaging in his brain.)\n\nAside from having a family history of brain aneurysms, a person\u2019s risk increases if they have high blood pressure, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol excessively or snort cocaine. Women are also more likely to have one than men.\n\nSome people drop dead instantly from brain aneurysms, while others experience the worst headache they will ever get. If they seek medical attention, they might live, but more than a few people have dismissed the headaches thinking they\u2019ll pass. (They don\u2019t.)\n\nAn important thing to remember: if one day, just out of the blue, you experience the worst headache you\u2019ve ever had in your life - like someone took a baseball bat to your head - go to the hospital, insurance or no. You cannot recover from a brain aneurysm on your own. You will die.\n\nBTW, I\u2019m not a doctor, just someone who did a lot of reading on the subject.",

This leaking (sentinel bleed) may cause only a:\n\n* Sudden, extremely severe headache\n\nA more severe rupture often follows leaking.\n\n**Unruptured aneurysm**\n\nAn unruptured brain aneurysm may produce no symptoms, particularly if it's small. However, a larger unruptured aneurysm may press on brain tissues and nerves, possibly causing:\n\n* Pain above and behind one eye\n* A dilated pupil\n* Change in vision or double vision\n* Numbness of one side of the face\n\n**When to see a doctor**\n\nSeek immediate medical attention if you develop a:\n\n* Sudden, extremely severe headache\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483\n\nEdit: Formatting.

The biggest indicator IMO is family history. If you have any blood relatives that have had aneurysms or unexplained sudden deaths from strokes, go get screened. \n\nI had three known blood relatives with ruptured annies. I got screened in November, found out I had a 6mm unruptured aneurysm, and had a craniotomy in December to fix it. I had no symptoms prior.",

I saw him in person at the filming of Battlebots he was signing a bunch of stuff and taking pictures with kids and even older nerds like me.

I did my intros like I always did - shook his hand and he told me he was Grant.\n\nWe kind of talked as a group for a bit then they had to run to host a panel. Grant was a very nice guy to talk to, very down to earth. As soon as he left, my wife looked at me and said 'did you not realize who he was?' She said this because she knew I was an avid Mythbusters fan and watched the show all the time. 'No...?' I replied.\n\n'Thats Grant Imahara...!' I looked at her for a second and muttered out \"who the hell is that?\"\n\nTook me about a full minute to realize how stupid I was to not recognize him, even after he said his name. Nonetheless, he was cool and was a sharp individual our world lost.\n\nEdit: Just looked through old photos. It was 2014 - the same year we dressed as part of a wizard punk cosplay group.",

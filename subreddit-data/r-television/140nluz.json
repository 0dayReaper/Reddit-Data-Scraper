It\u2019s a good piece of music and suits Game of Thrones well but feels out of place with the tone of House of the Dragon, the new themes and music created for the show suit it\u2019s story and characters much better than the title sequence does.",

This feels extremely lazy and if you know the theme very well you can notice the digital edits and it's quite painful.",

I'm as obsessive a fan of Tolkien as they come and could only bring myself to watch the *Hobbit* films once (maybe twice for the first one?), with the result that I generally don't think about them much at all. RoP meanwhile I've had many more feelings about, both good and bad. It certainly hasn't left me indifferent. Partly I'm sure it's due to the topic matter/source material - I personally am more into Elves and Men and the First &amp; Second Age than Hobbits and Dwarves and the Third... but then again that's what subjective feelings are about. And again there's a lot I find infuriating (eg the whole Galadriel &amp; Halbrand thing) - but not bland.\n\nEdit: damn but reddit really gets triggered by anything that's not pure condemnation of this show.",

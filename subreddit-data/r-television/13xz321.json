    "postText": "\nAkiea Goldsman, Et.Al. has produced the show Titans, which is based on DC comics. It stars Brenton Thwaites from The Giver and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Teagan Croft, Anna Diop, Curran Walters, Minka Kelly, Ryan Potter from Big hero 6, and Alan Ritchson from The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.\n \nRachel Roth (Teagan Croft) has darkness inside of her, after her mom dies she eventually meets Dick Grayson (Brenton Thwaites), who is a police officer. They set out to find other people with powers to form a team known as the Titans. Together, Dick Grayson, Gar Logan (Ryan Potter), and Kory Anders (Anna Diop), try to protect Rachel from her father, who wants to use her powers for evil.\n \nI have liked other DC shows such as: Arrow, Supergirl, and Batwoman. I really wanted to like Titans because of how different it was, its dark in tone and visuals , the concept is unique  for a superhero show, and it looked like there would be an interesting storyline regarding why Rachel\u2019s dad wants her powers. Instead, I found it boring and the mystery not compelling enough.\n \nThere are some things I do like about this show. I like the characters powers, Kory can summon fire from the sun, Gar can turn into a tiger, and Rachel who is my favorite is trying to be good while having darkness inside of her. If you\u2019re going to watch this show don\u2019t go in with high expectations.",

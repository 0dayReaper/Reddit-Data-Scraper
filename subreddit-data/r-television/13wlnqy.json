I agree that older seasons had a much more stellar cast, bit even in the newer ones there are some great choices.\n\n\nWhat I mean is that I expected AHS to explore various different and unique horror tropes but unfortunately it got stuck in its loop of ghosts, witches and serial killers.\n\n\nThere is soo many other subgenres that could be explored like space horror or Lovecraftian horror. Maybe seasons about cryptids, medieval times \u2026\n\n\nThey even screwed up the alien season (or better said - half season). Was hyped to see them finally give some well deserved spotlight to aliens but oh well.\n\n\nI also think the show puts way too much spotlight on sexual aspect. Nothing wrong with that when it\u2019s used in moderation or with an actual reason, but lately it\u2019s just there for the humor and gratification.\n\n\nI need some good horror anthology asap.",

There's a lot of interesting sci-fi coming out of China.\n\nI don't know if they can sell an idea like that to the CCP though and without their approval it can't show in China, which doesn't have Netflix anyway. I feel you'd need access to the Chinese market if you're actually going to tell stories about China. Although Netflix is making The Three Body Problem so perhaps there is some hope for such an idea.",

After that, maybe Aaron Paul? The supporting actor from a popular TV show over a decade ago is the \"big name\"?",

That being said, the first two seasons weren't made for Netflix, so their audience was strictly British-based, at that point. When they made the first two seasons, they weren't necessarily aiming for a more international audience. \n\nWhich is why you can start seeing the shift from British audiences to international/American audiences I would say by season 4 (I think season 3 was a test season to see if international audiences would enjoy it; once it was a hit, that's when they geared their episodes for a broader audience). \n\nAnd that also shows through casting. They got more decently know British/Scottish actors in their first few seasons, and then branched out to more well known names after. I would argue that the White Christmas episode with Jon Hamm is the one that showed people that they could make Black Mirror an international hit.",

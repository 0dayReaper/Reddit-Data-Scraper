Pipi Gilpin will be back to play Roz as a recurring guest role and so will Bebe Neuwirth to play Lilith but I just don't see how you can do it with Niles, Daphne and Martin all gone.\n\nEdit: I hope I'm pleasantly surprised but I don't see a few guest appearances from Cheers alums making up for missing so much of the original main cast.",

But that's the beauty of a proper spin off. You take an outline of a character and you flesh them out in a whole new universe.\n\nBut this is a revival of Frasier the show. That's already fleshed out. Revivals don't have the freedom to be their own thing. There will be a push/pull need to keep old fans happy but also force a new spin.\n\nAnd how do you \"revive\" something when the majority isn't even there.\n\nRevivals are usually cash grabs. There are exceptions (cobra Kai) but they are rare",

In 1992, Kelsey Grammer appeared as Frasier Crane without the Cheers gang in an episode of Wings, that other sitcom by the writers who created his character and would go on to create Frasier. It was extremely well received critically and publically, to the point that Grammer submitted himself for Emmy consideration using it instead of a Cheers episode, and got himself nominated for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series. (Putting him up against Ted Danson for playing Sam.) Grammer had already agreed to do a new sitcom with those writers once Cheers ended, and spent a couple of years tossing ideas around for it. After the Wings episode aired it became pretty common to see people, both on Usenet and in magazines (I know Entertainment Weekly did a story about it), saying he should just do a full Frasier spinoff. A big part of why Frasier exists to begin with is that the character had already been successful appearing without the Cheers gang and people wanted more.",

He also has one achievement on Woody in that he's been the lead actor in the #1 highest grossing movie of the year (Three Men and a Baby) which counts for some movie star points.\n\n- 1982 - 1993, Cheers\n- 1996 - 1997, Ink, short lived but really fun show he co-created \n- 1998 - 2004, Becker\n- 2006 - 2007, Help Me Help You\n- 2007 - 2010, Damages\n- 2009 - 2011, Bored to Death (IMO his best show but kind of a cult classic)\n- 2011 - 2016, CSI\n- 2015, Fargo (all season, not a one-off)\n- 2016 - 2020, The Good Place\n- 2018 - ongoing, Advancements (documentary series he hosts)\n- 2021 - 2022, Mr. Mayor (the only one I'd call bad)\n\nNot counting things like Curb Your Enthusiasm where he's been in dozens of episodes but not as main cast.\n\nHaving starring roles on mostly high-profile shows for 41 years straight is kinda crazy. I can't think of anyone with a comparably long and consistent career off the top of my head. What other sitcom stars from the 80s have been successfully starring in shows through 2020, not counting a single long-running or revived show (e.g. Patrick Stewart as Picard)? Who would be the next most prolific TV star? Closest I can think of is Henry Winkler but he has long gaps. Maybe Gillian Anderson if she keeps doing stuff for another 10 years.",

She walked right past the carts and up to me, asking if I could get her a cart. I kind of recognized her, but wasn\u2019t sure as I wasn\u2019t an avid Cheers watcher and most of the movies I\u2019d seen her in were easily made ten years prior to this. \n\nI grabbed the cart and brought it to her and she said, \u201cok, follow me.\u201d I was confused but just complied, and basically pushed a cart for 20 minutes while she walked around the store, mostly talking to her friend but occasionally pointing at things on various shelves and saying \u201cgrab two of those\u201d to me without making eye contact or breaking her conversation. \n\nI shot several annoyed looks to the store manager sand he made it clear I needed to shut up and continue. \n\nShe had me put everything on the conveyor belt, bags back in the cart, and unload them into her trunk. \n\nShe never said a single word to me other than telling me what to do, and there wasn\u2019t a thank you at the end. \n\nIt was weird\u2026 I legit felt violated and couldn\u2019t wrap my head around someone feeing so entitled they immediately recruit a store employee as a personal aid  without exchanging any pleasantries or even just asking for help. She expected it, and she didn\u2019t care about the human who did it. \n\nI don\u2019t think I was even mad, I just knew I was never going to allow that to happen to me again.",

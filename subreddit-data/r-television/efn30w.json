    "postText": "We just finished the John Mulaney special and were enjoying the David Byrne song, but then HEY WATCH LOST IN SPACE HERE'S A LOUD PREVIEW! Same with a movie we were watching last night that actually had additional scenes during the credits, but nope, let's cut it off for another preview. There's no longer an opportunity to decompress or think about what you just watched unless you remember to actually click on the credits to bring it back to full screen. And as far as I've seen, there's no setting anywhere to change this.\n\nIt's the most obnoxious user interface change they've made. At least you can mute the autoplaying trailers on the home screen and it remembers your preference. But there's no getting around cutting off the credits to movies unless you deliberately take action to click on the minimized picture. Screw you, Netflix.",

Of course it's only a matter of time before they throw another one just as bad my way and I'm forced to do it again. \n\nGet your shit together Netflix, you're forcing me to downvote everything outside my area of interest and annoying the hell out of your users.

Then they took the data of what people did after watching credits and determined that they probably browsed around and couldn't find anything else to watch. And then when it comes time to cancel their subscriptions, those data points all aligned to \"There's not enough selection.\" And so they decide it's best to shove something tangentially related in enough people's face quickly enough so that they will never go into content drought.",

I never scroll through what Netflix offers because the auto play is so infuriating... plus the fact that you have to scroll through 9 shit Netflix originals to find one actual show.\n\nTheir superior UI doesn't mean shit if it's more painful to deal with than a terrible UI. I really, honestly can't wrap my head around why they have dug their heels in with this \"feature\" that a lot of people hate and could easily be turned off.. It's fucking obnoxious and unless their UI can read my thoughts, nothing about it will compensate for the annoying strings attached to it.",

I love that damn song and the first time I watched stranger things I completely forgot about the skip credits bullshit while I was rocking out. I got a full 5 seconds of guitar and then boom next episode. \n\nAlso you were correct, it\u2019s episode 2 if you wanna go jam out. \n\nI\u2019m torn on this topic especially about the end credits and skipping. Personally if I\u2019m binging a show I\u2019ve seen 1000 times with the same outro then yeah. Let\u2019s skip this bitch. But on a new show or if the credits are different at the end or maybe I just need to fucking pee and have lost the remote in a blanket I would like the fucking option to disable that shit. Stranger things has great music at the end of the show and carries the tone of the episode into your possible introspection after the fact. I want to watch. I want to rock out. And I most definitely do not want that shit starting if there is still scenes happening on the tv. \n\nI want to say it was the last episode of Russian Doll and they were still pulling the camera out of the scene and music was happening and the show wasn\u2019t fucking over and what does netflix do??? Shrink the screen and throw a bullshit ad in my face. The disrespect. You could taste it in the air.",

There are times I find myself feeling like I'm in that episode of Black Mirror where I have to give credits to get the constant playback of porn to stop. \n\nI watch prime whenever I can, but some content is only available on Netflix so we're basically screwed. I could stop streaming television and just read books or listen to music instead, but I love film and tv. It's what I went to college for. It's a really difficult position to be in, to deal with an inane amount of bullshit or just forget it altogether and be completely out of touch with one of your main hobbies. \n\nTis the way of the world these days, but damn if it isn't a huge bummer.",

You can't find a TV series you want to watch and see all the seasons there. Each season is treated like a different program.  If the language of the program isn't in English there will be dubbed and subtitled versions of the movie/show listed as completely different titles! You can't just cue it up and decide if you want to watch it dubbed or subtitled.",

People watching tv shows want the next episode to play RIGHT AWAY. They don\u2019t want to sit through the same credit sequence 10 times a day when they\u2019re binging a show. And they don\u2019t want to watch end credits either. I know it\u2019s anecdotal but even watching the new Star Wars this afternoon and 2/3 of the theater left 5 seconds after the movie ended. Unless it\u2019s a Marvel movie with the promise of a post credit scene people don\u2019t want to stick around (and even then plenty of people walk out soon as credits start).\n\n\nAvid movie and show watchers want to sit on the ending of a movie or show and think about/discuss it. And we want to take in a particularly creative credit sequence.  But the average user just wants the show to get on with it or they want to see the next thing and not have to sit through 5 minutes of credits. I agree with you but we\u2019re in the minority and this will never change because of that.",

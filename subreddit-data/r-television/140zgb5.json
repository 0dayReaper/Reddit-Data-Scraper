    "postText": "I am not sure how many people have been following the recent news with Reddit and how they have decided to begin charging for API access for 3rd party apps.  \nI am also not sure how the majority of you access Reddit whether it is on the official app, Apollo (the iPhone Reddit app and largest 3rd party app), RedditIsFun (known as RIF which is an Android Reddit app) or any of the pushshift based sites like Unddit and Reveddit. This change also cripples most moderator sites and addons that many moderators use to help handle the huge amount of comments and posts they deal with on a daily basis.  \nI will provide some links below that explain the issues better since it would take a very long post to cover everything.\n\n  \nHere is the post from 4 days ago that was made by the developer of Apollo.  \n[https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had\\_a\\_call\\_with\\_reddit\\_to\\_discuss\\_pricing\\_bad/](https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)\n\n  \nMore info from the ModNews sub.  \n[https://old.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api\\_update\\_continued\\_access\\_to\\_our\\_api\\_for/](https://old.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/)\n\n  \nHow these changes affect any visually impaired Reddit users.  \n[https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit\\_to\\_the\\_visually\\_impaired\\_you\\_no\\_longer/](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/)\n\n  \nAnd the current list of subs participating in the proposed blackout.  \n[https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete\\_and\\_growing\\_list\\_of\\_participating/](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/)\n\n  \nI think that for any users here who moderate any other subs, or who have not see this information in other subs you use regularly please spread the word and get other subs to participate.

A lot of the subreddits I've seen post this have also said they're prepared to go longer if necessary.  For instance /r/guildwars2 has said they're planning on [locking the subreddit on July 1st](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13znkn2/reddit_is_going_to_kill_3rd_party_mobile_app/) unless the changes are abandoned.\n\n&gt;Also what, if anything, is going to stop reddit from just removing the mods and reopening a sub and replacing the mods with more sympathetic people? \n\nNothing really, I suppose, but I doubt it'd go in the way they hope.  Anyone that is eager to take over an established subreddit whose mods have been there for years is likely not someone you want running a subreddit.  I have to think that would just add to the backlash, and hopefully Reddit is smart enough to realize that (though, I can't say I'm exactly confident that's the case).",

Without Mods there is literally no Reddit. However Reddit leadership's priorities currently are aligned in a way that is clear. Mods are not priority for them. However if Mods pick a fight with Reddit leadership the latter isn't just going to roll over, PRECISELY because of the now underlying numbers which are different to how it was 5-10 years ago.\n\nHence for a Symbolic Protest to be successful (since that is the logical objective), one needs to have clear structure to the protest, it can't be nonsensical indefinite strike. That is just moronic. \n\nRedesign won, every Modteam on reddit knows this (since sub-traffic metrics are now visible to Mods-only).  \n2 Official Apps (Android-iOS) won.\n\nReddit as a company will have no qualms getting rid of Mods given that the Scale of Reddit now is big enough that those 90% have enough to sustain it. Just because it will be lower quality is trivial question since Reddit leaders aren't bothered with that aspect to being with anyway. Their priorities in the short-medium term are different and losing 10% of 3rd party mobile app users is not a big deal.\n\nBesides it's already non-credible claim that ALL of those 10% will just leave Reddit. Like, seriously?\n\nThe user shedding will be fraction from that already minnority fraction.\nAnd there will be no Digg Moment because there is no pre-existing Reddit Alternative of note (this being relevant since it can't just be anyone. Reddit is not Twitter, it's platform design and type of content it generates, sustain is different because it's platform structure is different).",

The problem is that even by very optimistic calculations, API access for one average user costs multiple times as much as reddit could ever possibly make per user.\n\nThere is a calculation [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) that favors reddits position *a lot* and it is still ridiculous. While reddit roughly makes $0.12 per user and month, they ask for $2.50 for the equivalent of API access. So they try to make 20x the money through the API. That's straight up bullying.\n\nAnd calculations like that don't even cover other aspects. E.g. an API user is cheaper for reddit than a regular user. Or if the API would not be usable, people would go back to web scrapers for building 3rd party services which put much heavier strain on their servers and therefore create more costs.",

The community isn't really going to grow without some weird external stimulus, so modding those subs becomes even more rote work of checking the mod queue, seeing spam, and removing it. The alternative is to abandon the sub and leave it for the spammers and scammers to prey on and any innocent user that happens to wander in can be a victim.\n\nHell, even I have subs like that. For example, /r/TheStrain ended in 2017 and I'm still mod there because every now and then a spammer shows up and I ban them and report them to the admins. No one else will do that job, and it takes minimal effort from me, so why not be a nice person and help out. It's like cleaning up garbage along a walking path because you want it clean. If no one else is going to do it, then I may as well.\n\nAlso, Nick is an exceptional internet janitor. When I modded this place he would even beat out Automod for mod actions on the sub. If there were 1000 (not the real number, just using this as an example) mod actions in a month, Nick would be like 350 of them, Automod would be 300, I'd be around 200, and the remaining 150 would be between the rest. And yes, I'm fully aware being a mod is just being an internet janitor.  It's not a glorious job, but it's a necessary one. That's why I stick with communities I actually enjoy these days.",

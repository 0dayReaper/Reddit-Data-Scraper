Draw out those first rounds as much as you can... place things like elemental effects, knowing full well they hurt you, so that later you will clear those elemental effects.  Every time you play a card, they play a card.  Except while you're playing shit that isn't worth much, they're playing shit that's usually worth more.  Then once you've tricked them into playing a really strong hand, you simply fold and accept the loss.\n\nIn the subsequent rounds, they've got fuck all to work with and you've still got all your best cards in  hand.",

It's unbalanced as fuck too, so as soon as you get a few good cards you just get more and more unbeatable. So fight people in the wilderness who suck first, don't like start by going against the king who had the undead baby (long enough ago i've forgotten all the names) because he's legit hard even with ok cards. Use Northern Realms cards, easiest to start with.\n\nThe gwent standalone has evolved so far beyond it at this point (in an effort to make all the decks balanced) that I can't even really fathom it anymore. I should dive back in at some point though, been a while.",

Then blow all your spies in the first round, being ready to throw it if needed, and you'll have a massive card lead going into the rest of the match.

Back when all the schools were alive and well, making more, and monsters were everywhere.\n\nStart us off as a child of surprise.  Take us to one of the strongholds, Kaer Morhen even.  Let us bond with a bunch of other kids as we do our training, put us through the trial of grasses and let us watch most of our friends die horribly.  Second half of the game, we go out and fight monsters on our own.",

The show takes some liberties (have to for TV) but it is surprisingly faithful to the source material.\n\nEDIT: because this kinda blew up-- the best story, and quite possibly one of the saddest short stories I have ever read, is called \"A Little Sacrifice\" from *The Sword of Destiny*. The last few paragraphs of that are utterly heartbreaking. It isn't covered in the TV series, for good reason.",

But I'm finally getting into it after Flotsam, even though none of these issues have changed. Thankfully, it's extremely short compared to Wild Hunt",

                                    "comment": "Gwent is a card game that can be played within the game. It proved to be so popular that many Witcher III players reported that they spent their time as Geralt just playing Gwent rather than completing the actual (and extremely urgent) quest at the heart of the game. The game producers' response to this was to acknowledge that a more efficient means of playing Gwent was theoretically possible, and so a standalone version of the game was also eventually released.\n\nAs for within the game itself: while it's not strictly 100% necessary to pay much attention to the card game if you'd prefer to focus on other things, there are at least a couple of later missions where a knowledge of how it works and the possession of a good deck are important. The easiest way to gain both is by playing a round with everyone you can as you meet them, with new cards as prizes for winning. It can be a gargantuan pain in the ass to have to go back and find everyone who you could play with if you skip over it the first time. Anyway, it only becomes a time sink if you let it. A typical Gwent game only takes a couple of minutes, once you're solid on the rules, and there's usually only one or two people per town/city/etc who will be players.",

In case anyone's wondering, that's a fucking steal for this game that you'll easily get ~~60~~ 120 hours out of\n\nEdit since people are really bothered by my use of \"60\" that was just a number pulled from thin air. Most AAA games cost $60 and a lot of them don't even have 60 hours of gameplay so I was saying that you will get your money's worth and more. Real estimate in in the 100s. I'm at 22 hours on my replay and I'm nowhere near the middle of the game much less the end so don't worry, there's a fuck ton to do in this game. So you can expect well over 60 but I guarantee at least 60 unless you're a speed-runner.",

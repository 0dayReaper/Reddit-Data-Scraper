Two people I wouldn\u2019t expect to see together but they had great chemistry.\n\nI totally get people like Harrison Ford who are just sick of these movies, but it\u2019s just nice to see people who are in the things we love and actually love it too.\n\nMan Hayden has a lot of charm and charisma. He needs a new agent because he should get more opportunities. Luna is so personable here, and he\u2019s such a good actor too. Looking forward to the next season of Andor, even if we won\u2019t see it until like 2030",

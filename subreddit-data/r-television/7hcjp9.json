            "comment": "&gt; Crews remixed a 2006 letter written by power agent Ari Emanuel (now the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor) that demanded Mel Gibson be held accountable for his anti-Semitism. In the new letter, Crews simply replaced Gibson\u2019s name with Adam Venit\u2019s and the term \u201canti-semitism\u201d with \u201csexual assault\u201d and gave it to Emanuel. \n\n&gt;\u201dHe said \u201cit\u2019s different\u201d and handed the letter back to me.\u201d\n\nNow that\u2019s fucked up.\n\n\nEdit: I encourage everyone to subscribe to r/CrewsCrew to show support for Terry and keep up with Crews news!",

In this case I believe Terry was the only one to make accusations and none of his high profile clients left the agency. The initial media pulse blew over and the agency is doing what all companies do when the storm passes, go back to business as usual and hope no one notices.",

They don't even need to do that.  Just pressure from their top clients would do the trick I expect.  If they are represented by Venit, demand a different agent at WME, I'm sure those morally sound agents would have no problem with accepting an A list client!\n\n",

And I think calling Venit an agent is underselling the amount of water this guy draws in that sphere, he was head of the entire motion picture division. I think firing him is like saying replace the person in charge of all the agents that represent our biggest stars. I wouldn't be surprised if you dug into the ownership structure at WME this guy is more similar to a being a partner at a law firm than being what we would think of as an employee. It would certainly explain why he's being protected and wasn't immediately turfed out on his ass.\n\nI'm not excusing giving him a pass on this shit just saying that I think that this guy is essentially more powerful than those stars even if we had never heard of him before. I mean even Adam Sandler who apparently saw this happen has been totally mute about it. A sad testament to how powerful people are enabled to get away with things by the people around them staying silent to protect their own interests. Look how long Weinstien got away with being a complete piece of shit while everyone around him already knew it, only the weight of the multiple accusations dragged him down.\n\nSadly one man complaining about being assaulted by Venit wasn't enough to do him in.",

If the average consumer doesn't know who you are well enough to know what you did, your continued employment won't hurt profits.",

It's the same problem with \"me, too\": as long as we keep focusing on individual perpetrators and victims, rather than the system that produces these outcomes, nothing will change.\n\nEdit: This throwaway comment got way more attention than I thought it would, so I\u2019ll try to elaborate. First, it\u2019s really systems rather than a single system, per se (and second, I don\u2019t have all the answers, I\u2019m just some idiot on Reddit). But anyway, most immediately, in the US we have a legal system that basically makes it okay for organizations to ignore harassment, as long as they can cover it up or make victims shut the fuck up. So we end up with HR systems that \u2013 instead of encouraging people to report abuse \u2013 [make it incredibly difficult to report harassment and actually keep functioning at your job]( https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/20/16679104/congress-sexual-harssment-process-explained). One way to change this would be to threaten companies and individuals with murderously expensive fines and jail time if they cover up harassment allegations, and provide stricter guidelines for internal investigations (and again, make it murderously expensive to not comply with those guidelines). \n\n~~Second~~Fourth (I can't count), we have a system of employment in which [most workers are considered \u201cat-will\u201d employees]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will_employment) who can be dismissed for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all. This is pretty unique in the world \u2013 most countries, [including all of Europe]( http://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2013/04/07/european-employment-law-101-employment-at-will-is-truly-a-foreign-concept/), require employers to show cause before firing someone. While there are formal legal exceptions to at-will employment, including wrongful termination (e.g., firing someone for reporting sexual harassment), at-will termination is the default, and the burden of proof is on the employee to show that they were wrongfully terminated. Employees covered by union contracts are a major exception to at-will employment, but business has spent the better part of the last four decades waging a successful legal, PR, and economic war on unions, so today something like 93% of the labor force is non-union.  \n\n~~Third~~Fifth, it seems to me that industries in which certain individuals command an inordinate amount of direct influence over resources are especially ripe for abusers to take root. I don\u2019t really have any answers or more developed thoughts on this, but to the extent that media concentration continues and more mergers are allowed, I don\u2019t see that problem getting any better.\n\n~~Fourth~~Sixth (and most assured to attract the downvotes), we have a system of patriarchy that helps normalize the abuse of *both women and men*. If you don\u2019t see how normal harassment is for women, I suggest you listen to virtually any woman around you \u2013 that was kind of the whole #metoo thing. I can\u2019t tell you how many stories I\u2019ve heard from female friends who didn\u2019t speak up because they were terrified that they would be hurt, or worse, if they complained. As for how it normalizes the abuse of men, it encourages us to see men as tough, emotionless, and thus unable to be abused. If you\u2019re a man claiming sexual abuse, you\u2019re either a pussy or a liar. What\u2019s the big deal, you want any sex you can get, right? And so on. Addressing this requires a cultural shift that will probaby take a long time, and involve all of us. As a dude, you can start by sticking up for women, and shutting that toxic masculine bullshit down when your friend or a stranger makes a just-us-guys comment (I\u2019ve mostly done this with taxi drivers, and try to take a straightforward rather than self-righteous approach, e.g. \"look at her - she's distracting me with that skirt\" \"maybe keep your eyes on the road then?\"\u2013 they\u2019re usually taken aback, but settle down).\n\nFinally, to the fellow idiot below who said you fix systems of oppression by punishing individuals: if that worked, we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation, and also [the three strikes law would have eliminated drug crime (spoiler: it didn\u2019t)]( https://phys.org/news/2012-02-three-strikes-law-crime.html). You fix systems of oppression by changing systems. ",

Quite rightly too.\n\nWhereas if a guy has his ass grabbed he may have the tools to end said threat but he can\u2019t use those tools without a the (considerable) risk of looking like the aggressor. \n\nSure, from a psychological perspective there is that knowledge that you could at least get out of the situation, but in 99/100 cases the physically stronger person isn\u2019t actually better off.\n\n\n\n",

Throughout my life my dad never made any attempt to understand my hobbies.  He tried to make me play sports and, when that failed, more or less proceeded to yell at me for being awful until I moved out at 19.  Me reading about Terry Crews building a PC to game with his kid was actually the first time I'd ever heard of a non-fictional father going out of his way to bond with his kid over his kid's hobbies.\n\nTerry Crews is the shit.  I wish he was my dad. ",

I don't think it would be taken seriously, I'd be judged negatively and it'd have derailed my career there.\n\nI dunno, I have read in one AskReddit thread that most men are never commented on for their appearance. The comments were mostly positive (I lost a lot of weight in the gym over the past two years), but yeah... I would tell friends that I was totally being sexually harassed daily when I was working there.\n\nJust a perspective. I don't want to post this on social media with my real name for fear of being lashed out at as trying to mansplain or steal attention.\n\nedit: After looking down at replies to this thread, yeah, I think the entire reaction of my department/bosses would have been \"They're complimenting you...?

As a result I'm sexually harassed basically every day by at least one customer.   Intially I took it as a compliment.

As a guy I can't say anything about it.\n\nI grew up with a single mom who was very much into feminism as a result of growing up in the 60s and 70s, so I've always heard her ripping on guys for sexually harassing women.  But, even she has trivialized my experiences to an extent (IE \"Well women have had it worse.\") which is true, but, I literally have been experiencing things that would bring her in a rage when she'd discuss sexual harassment. \n\nI try not to care so much, but, it feels dirty when I can't even say anything because it's a customer who I depends on tips and even if I do disregard my tip I would end up getting in trouble with my management. Too make it worse in my experience women who harass me seem to never even tip me decently.  Like if you're going to make me feel awkward the entire time you're in the restaurant At least give me a decent tip! \n\nSorry, end rant. ",

It is expected that we document their inappropriate  behavior. Depending on the severity/frequency of the harassment, the resident may be given their 30 days notice or the family required to move them asap. The men also tend to be aware it is inappropriate and don't attempt it in a common area.\n\nIt is not as common with the female residents, but every once in awhile, you get one that has no shame. If you sit them next to a man, they will not keep their hands to themselves. I had to remove a female resident from a church service because she kept changing seats to sit next to another resident's college age grandson and attempting to give him a hand job.\n\nAsked a male co-worker if she was like that when he did her care. She was worse one on one, but he was afraid to report it. I reported both incidents to management and their response was like \"haha, how cute! A 97 year old lady flirting with 20 year olds!\". I ended up going to the home office and had her care plan changed to \"no male caregivers\". Had a male resident done that to another resident's family member, they would have had 24/7 private duty until they moved out.\n\n",

Erin Pizzey wanted to take this genderless approach to domestic violence. She recognized the violence of men, *and* women. And that it was a learned pattern of behavior a lot of the time. That often these violent people came from violent pasts. \n\nPeople need to be helped, so they don't repeat the cycle. Unfortunately, with domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment... it's all been painted as a gendered issue that primarily, if not exclusively affects girls and women at the hands of boys and men. It even ignores female victims of female perpetrators.\n\nIt's like [HPV](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-40658791), we often focus on vaccinating girls instead of just vaccinating all children. Despite the fact it would be far more beneficial to have everyone possible vaccinated for it. \n\nIt makes no sense to look at one side of a problem and try to \"cure\" it. When we could greatly improve things, but just focusing on THE PROBLEM. And how it affects everybody. The more people we help, the better off we are. \n\nWe can't keep ignoring boys and men who are victims. That's not going to help girls and women. We need to stop looking at non-gendered issues as gendered ones. ",

Jennifer Aniston's whole character revolves around raping men, primarily Charlie Day's character. threatening to tell his fiance that he had sex with her unless he actually does! at the end the solution to charlie Day's problem is that he convinces aniston to rape an unconcious patient, while he secretly records it. and uses it for blackmail. that whole movie is fucked.",

Kind of like The Rock, you can just tell that his popularity and success is going nowhere but up, and probably very quickly. It also feels like he has gained a great deal of respect by telling his story of harassment.\n\nGo to a different agency if your current one is being disrespectful.

Don't throw in the \"but...\". Just leave the little acknowledgement, and keep talking universally. Otherwise you just further stigmatize it, and make us feel like we can't be a part of the conversation. There are plenty of men, myself included, who have not only never reported their assault but rarely discuss it with people in our own lives because of the stigmas that come along with it, and this sentiment that you somehow are more to blame for your rape because you're not as \"powerless\" as women. \n\nSorry, end of rant.",

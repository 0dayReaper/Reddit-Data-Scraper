After some time of just struggling to fit in the boys real parents show up and he decides to live with them. The orphanage reaches out to check on the little boy and it's revealed his real parents died years ago. Turns out it was a kidnapping set up by a guy that lived in Hugh Laurie's house for a gang he's a part of. In the end he has a change of heart and helps bring the boy home.",

Also if you compare it to Jon Hamm or Bryan Cranston looking back, it wasnt unreasonable to see why he never won.\n\nThe formulaic nature of the show and his characters impossibility to grow due to his ego and jadedness just sets him up to be a miserable genius that you cant peel your eyes away from, but given the chance you wouldnt want to spend your day with either.",

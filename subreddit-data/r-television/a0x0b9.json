Stephen Hillenburg, thank you for your creativity.\n\nWith apologies to anyone who may be offended but because I have also known someone who suffered and passed away quickly from ALS, it is important for me to share the good news about research advances being made by scientists around the world.\n\n [The ALS Association](http://web.alsa.org/site/PageNavigator/ALSA_research_impact) (remember the Ice Bucket Challenge that quadrupled their donations?) has over 150 research projects active worldwide and has been assessed a 4/4 star rating for finances, transparency, and accountability by [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3296).\n\nEdit: For local support group information, please see [here](http://www.alsa.org/community/support-groups/).",

She first had some trouble eating and drinking. Then, she became unable to talk in anything other than slurred words. (Imagine it as if you sounded like you were horribly drunk all the time.) Then she lost her voice entirely. Finally, she couldn't eat anything and was only able to get liquids in by squeezing a sponge in her mouth and hoping enough went down her throat. (Swallow control was completely gone.)\n\nEventually, she fell asleep and didn't wake up again. After a few days of \"sleeping\", she passed away.\n\nRight up to the end, she was completely conscious about what was happening as she slowly lost control of her own body and became more and more trapped in it. \n\nIt's a horrible way to go.",

I related to every character, but Spongebob was my inspiration and role model. \nHe was always so happy with whatever life threw at him. Spongebob was bullied constantly too. Did that ever stop him? No. He kept being himself, and despite his flaws and mistakes, the world loved Spongebob for it. \nIt made me feel loved too. \n\nSpongebob reminded me that not all is lost because some people are jerks, because there is always someone that loves and appreciates you. \n\nSpongebob helped me through some dark times, even when the episodes became \"bad\". \n\n\nStephen Hillenburg may have just been a cartoonist, but he changed my life for the better. \n\n\nI still watch it today, with my granny. She hates Patrick, and my best memories right now is sitting and watching the show with her, while she berates Patrick and laughs at Squidward yelling at their antics. \n\n\nSpongebob is my favorite show.

It's *always* lighter in the summer. The streamers mostly feel like they have to have tentpole series in the same timeframe as tentpole movies, so things will heat up nearer July and (weirdly) August.\n\n&gt;Class of 09 is good purely because of the cast.

The only reason I'm there is for the writing: I only tuned in because I knew Tom Rob Smith (*ACS: Assassination of Gianni Versace, MotherFatherSon, London Spy)* was writing it. Maybe it's because I'm older and have watched over four decades' worth of British television, but while the pace is deliberate, and there's time-hopping, I don't find the show boring or confusing at all.  I was also happy as hell to see Steven Canals (showrunner of *Pose*) directed the last two episodes, though I think I'd be even happier if he was showrunning again.",

On average I had about 8 to 10 shows that I watched weekly and everyone was above average. Now seems it has gone down to only 3.\n\nThis is honestly why I waited on a number of series to watch until I finished all the other series (Succession, Barry, Beef, Ted Lasso Love and Death).\n\nIt's not as good of a lineup but still enjoyable.  \n\nSo now I can watch Silo, The Small Light, The White House Plumbers, Jury Duty, and American Born Chinese.",

Last week's episode wasn't available via Prime until Sunday evening in the US, but people who had the MGM+ standalone app were able to watch it at the usual late Saturday/early Sunday morning time.

There's a main mystery they touch on in the first two episodes. Then they ignore it to dig into how the Silo operates, world building, character development, other mysteries, etc. It's all interesting to me, not just the mystery they lay out in episode 1.  Also, it's based on a book, so there are answers to what's going on and the most recent episode revealed more of that. I'm glad I gave it a try.\n\nFROM is definitely that though lol.  It's schlocky mystery box horror.  I'm enjoying it just for the craziness. But it would fit right in with Surface or Manifest except it goes hard on gore. Full of ridiculous writing and every character has some mysterious backstory so they all act weird.",

One of my favorite episodes is the one where Boris Karloff asks Jim West to train his sons in the art of killing. It\u2019s one of the more grounded episodes, but it gave me heavy pulp vibes. It\u2019s also super funny binging the show because you notice a ton of the same stuntmen. There\u2019s this one stuntman who I especially notice all the time. I like to make silly head canon by thinking that he\u2019s an opportunistic mercenary who lends his henchman services to different megalomaniacs for money, lol.\n\nHart to Hart is also pretty crazy as well. You\u2019ll think an episode is boring based on its description, but then some crazy ass twist completely increases the hype factor. There was an episode that\u2019s description was something along the lines of, \u201ccroquet player gets stabbed and dies at Jonathan\u2019s feet,\u201d and the episode ended up including a CIA agent facing a renowned KGB assassin in mortal combat.

            "comment": "**Somebody Somewhere**\n\nFirst, I want to apologize to everyone.  I am aware that my presence and actions have consequences in this world.  For every criticism I receive, I do my best to work on my issues.  It has taken me a lot of work to improve my hygiene, my mastery of English mechanics, and my social skills.  Changing myself for the better, personality-wise, has helped me somewhat in navigating the difficult obstacles of society, but I have to learn to accept that there are just some things about myself that I can not change no matter how hard I try, and people will always hate me for it.  I have recently undergone over a decades' worth of homelessness that finally culminated in me being placed in a Deaf supportive living house (where the guy next door to me was a crazy one-eyed dude who kept me up all night with his screaming fits and throwing furniture against the floor) where I had been waiting for, and finally received, my very own apartment with very own kitchen and bathroom.  The homelessness and perpetual joblessness is a direct result of my appearance, which isn't something that could be addressed with plastic surgery or better medical devices.  If I try to go to a hobby event like board games or agriculture meetup, I am still avoided despite being well-groomed and articulate and outgoing.  That's the consequence of my decision to show my face and \"put myself out there\" and \"just be myself\".  I used to have this naive idealistic optimistic worldview that people are acceptive and inclusive, but that's just not the way the real world works in unscripted real life starring real people.  So now that I have a place where I can store food and prepare my own food and groom myself and have groceries delivered without having to take public transportation somewhere and offend others with my choice to remain alive, I can finally make the choice that better serves both myself and my community at large.  So, I am sorry to everyone that had to witness the enormity that was my defective face and the anxious, nervous timbre of my neurodivergent voice.\n\nThat being said, I couldn't last four fucking minutes into the first episode because Joel's face evoked literally the same reaction from me that my face evokes from everyone else.  I know how you guys feel now, and I am sorry. Secondly, the empathetic, concerned conversation between them literally never happens at all in real life whatsoever.  Except for the not recognizing Joel part; all my classmates were ready to forget me the moment graduation was over.  There's also literally no way that Joel would have gotten as far in his academic pursuits as he did in the show; in the real world, real teachers would just look at him and arbitrarily mark stuff wrong on his papers until he's flunked and dropped out.  Sorry, but if I wanted to watch fantasy about stuff that literally never happens, I'll watch Harry Potter or Passion of the Christ instead.  Negative 0 out of 5 stars.\n\n**The White House Plumbers**\n\nMy dad followed this news story live and broke it down for me pretty simply when I questioned the Watergate scene in Forrest Gump, and so far this series' chain of events seems to sync up perfectly, which is a testament to the HBO writers.  Sucked because we as a country still haven't learned our lessons with regards to how deceptive and underhanded the Republicans can be.  But yet we continue to vote for them anyway.  We get what we deserve, I guess, because now we're just sitting on our hands while Donald Trump is getting away with doing even worse directly than Nixon did through proxies.  Loved Howard Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy, and Plainclothes Cersei Lannister, and it's always good to see John Carroll Lynch pop up in another supporting role.  Someone needs to give that man a series lead quick before time catches up to him as it will to us all.  We already have Woody in True Detective and Justin in The Leftovers, so casting them again in THIS series -- while fun and enjoyable -- felt a little too fan-servicey to me, but then again, I shouldn't complain about good food if it's because they're sourcing the same reliable good quality ingredients.  4/5 stars, St. John's actor is so \"too old to play his character's age\" that it felt like a meta-comedic decision.",

I do think the show is very, very good, but it feels weird that &gt;!the company just lets them go off the rails, especially Helly. I mean if they can literally separate your mind into two different people, I think it wouldn't be too far fetched if they could just reset your ass and you'd forget about those rebellious thoughts or trying to commit suicide at the office. I just felt that since everything at Lumon, and their lives in general, was so organized that I think its weird they let them just think and do all those crazy things. In the vein of the other things they do, its odd that they weren't so strict about breaking protocols like they were about literally everything else.!&lt; I do think it is a very good show, but sometimes you just gotta turn your brain off and ignore some things. The last episode, there's actually some payoff and it sets up a 2nd season so well (and they better not fucking cancel it, I know they renewed it already but it wouldn't be the first time something got cancelled out of nowhere) that you're just left yearning for more and you absolutely have to find out what happens next. Adam Scott especially, he's just so damn good. But the other three as well, Cherry, Lower and Turturro, they're all so damn good. The whole cast is so damn good and that alone makes the show worth watching. I thought people had over-hyped it, but it actually is that good.",

Part of what drives the show is the characters knowing their innies have free will (even if they really don\u2019t) - free will to request to quit, free will to go off the rails (even if there are consequences like the break room). The moment the innies think they no longer have that, and their innie self can just disappear and be reset I\u2019d imagine it would cause some issues in the office. So I assumed they have that ability but don\u2019t like to execute it. In fact if you look at the words on the screen when Dylan is in the control room the options are: \u201cBEEHIVE, BRANCH TRANSFER, CLEAN SLATE, ELEPHANT, FREEZE FRAME, GLASGOW, GOLDFISH, LULLABY, OPEN HOUSE, OVERTIME\u201d \u2026and we only really know one of them. But you can take a guess that \u201cCLEAN SLATE\u201d does exactly what you\u2019re saying. You could also guess \u201cGOLDFISH\u201d has something to do with wiping memory, as a goldfish have a known short memory.!&lt;",

Basically a post-apocalyptic mystery/puzzle show under an umbrella of orwellian what-is-the-actual-truth-and-why-is-it-hidden vibes. Great premise, relies on some familiar tropes but in an interesting way, writing/performances are pretty good so far. \n\nOnly critique so far is that in ep three they spend A LOT of time on a particular dilemma &gt;!the broken generator!&lt; that feels completely unrelated to the actual storyline and, while we're supposed to feel suspense, you can kind of tell the stakes aren't actually as serious as the show wants you to think.",

First show I've actually been tangibly invested in the characters in suuuch a long time. recommend 10/10\n\nFinished Ted Lasso. I can tell this is going to become a comfort show in hard times.\n\nDrops of God - it's a little... wanky. But it's French so that's sort of understandable. Pretty intriguing. Ambivalent on the acting.  5/10\n\nIf it's a thriller with psychological elements please illuminate me to it's existence! Feel good shows are welcome too.

The 2nd season was in production, but the showrunners made the mistake of not having a scripted satisfying ending before start of production, so now its all frozen due to the writer's strike.\n\n1st season of The Terror.  Period piece on the failed Arctic Shackleton expedition.  Totally engrossing, and a stellar cast, fronted by Jared Harris. (Skip the 2nd season.)\n\nIts a long time ago, but I liked STARZ The White Queen.  Period piece on  the War of the Roses, starting with Edward IV.  But the series centers around the wives and daughters of the warring monarchs.  Its close to the historical events and based on a trilogy(?) written by Philippa Gregory.\n\nA little off brand, but Showtime's Spartacus might fill the spot.  Tremendous acting, particularly from John Hannah (Batiatus), Manu Bennett (Crixus), Peter Mensah (Doctore), and Nick Tarabay (Ashur).  (Lucy Lawless was Lucretia, wife of Batiatus.)\n\nEDIT: ...and how could I forget STARZ Black Sails!  Period piece on the pirate era in the Caribbean (but only loosely based on historical events).\n\nEDIT:  If you have Amazon Prime, you have to the end of June to binge watch the 1st season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds (10 1hr episodes).  (Even more time if you have a Paramount+ subscription.)",

I can\u2019t talk about the others.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What happened?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 1933, a bell-shaped vessel, about ten meters in size, was recovered in Magenta, northern Italy. It was kept by Mussolini\u2019s government until it was recovered by agents of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), an old US intelligence agency, in 1944. The irony is that it predates everything the public has heard about for decades, like Roswell, etc. I was authorized to talk about it by the Department of Defense\u2019s prepublication and security review office.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You talk about information concealed for decades: aren\u2019t you afraid of fueling unfounded conspiracy theories?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yess, there\u2019s always a probability that it will fuel other unfounded conspiracy theories. The irony is that this used to be a conspiracy theory that turns out to be true.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Have you seen exotic materials with your own eyes?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\u2019ve seen very interesting things that I'm not authorized to talk about publicly at the moment.

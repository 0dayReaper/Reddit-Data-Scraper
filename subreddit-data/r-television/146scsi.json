    "postText": "In the episode \u201cThree Maxes and a Little Lady\u201d, Alex and Justin disguise themselves as Max and they accidentally turn the real Max into a girl named Maxine (Bailee Madison). And thus Max is still Maxine for the next six to seven episodes (including a one hour special) until \u201cBack to Max\u201d when Maxine becomes Max again during the talent show.  \nYep, I get it. But now I don\u2019t understand these: why is Max turned into a girl by accident and what is his actor Jake T Austin doing in his absences?  \nIs he sick or did he just had to go filming in another show?  \nPlease comment below.",

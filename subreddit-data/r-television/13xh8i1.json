We fade to black and never hear about this series again. \n\nWe never know what she means and we never get a resolution. I haven't watched this show since they did that slide show animation finale. But yeah that's how I see it ending.",

The budget for the episode was already set at the beginning of the season and they can\u2019t just go to the production company and ask for more money. Animation is expensive and time consuming, must animation shows are done a year in advance. Most likely they got the best animation for the little budget they had left over.",

Tell me that's not a fucking dude, bro.\n\nLots of young folks don't pass super hard because they're still babies, I didn't look like an actual anything until at least 32 (part of why I had a gender identity crisis), and could never make peace with my femininity until my mid 30s (still non-binary but I'm okay with the plumbing I got, it's fine, and I am real cute sometimes). I'm both female and pass as female, but if I am feeling a \"dude\" day I can transform with relative ease and mostly pass, voice and all, which was less easy when I was younger. Something about the way we age, idk all the science behind it. \u00af\u2060\\\u2060_\u2060(\u2060\u30c4\u2060)\u2060_\u2060/\u2060\u00af\n\nBut when you look to older trans people, especially those who've been on HRT for many years (but even some who started more recently), they tend to pass ***amazingly well,*** like, they're not the ones who will be getting the genital checks, it'll be people that look like me. (Not that anyone should get them at all!! I'm just highlighting the absurdity of that crusade altogether.)\n\nI wish I had links to the first trans dude I ever met, he was a friend's brother, and when I met him, I was stunned, like, \"Whoa you're just a fuckin' dude!!\" Hrt even unlocked male patterned baldness, so he has the Picard hairstyle.\n\nOh, I found this, too: /r/FTMOver30 again go to top of all time for the impressive pics\n\nI think it was an interesting idea that got drawn out way too fucking long, I wish they'd finished it before Tom died.",

Who reddington was should have been revealed by season 3, then perhaps they could have done a few more seasons of Elizabeth going down the road of criminal captor to master criminal herself. \n\nThey could have teased a big bad villain throughout the seasons, revealing more and more his prominence in the show as the seasons progress. They could have had the last few seasons (no more than 5-6 seasons let\u2019s be real, nothing that goes past that usually is very good) focus on an explosive finale going after the big bad, with Liz squarely at Reddington\u2019s side, now fully embracing the criminal life. They could reveal Liz\u2019s mother in the final seasons, shaking up the relationship between Liz and Red. \n\nThe final resolution: in trying to take down the series bad, Red is killed. Liz\u2019s mother retires, swears to look after her granddaughter as Liz takes over Red\u2019s criminal empire. \n\nThere. I wrote it better.",

The first few seasons had a lot of themes about parenthood and relationships, with at least an intriguing overarching mystery, not about just who Raymond Reddington is, but moreso about who he is in relation to Elizabeth Keen, and why he is seemingly her protector.\n\nThen it literally put that on the back burner, dragged on, seemingly ended\u2026 and then didn\u2019t, somehow going on without the main protagonist.",

I used to enjoy the spectacle that was James Spader, and the premise had me intrigued for the first couple seasons, but after that it quickly became utterly tedious and nonsensical, and I could tell this would be another network show that just dragged oooon and oooon without ever reaching anything close to a satisfying conclusion. And indeed, after I thought they had the guts to genuinely kill off a main character and leave it like that, but suddenly decided \u201cfooled ya! They\u2019re not dead after all\u201d, I just quit the whole thing cold. I can\u2019t take bullshit like that.",

You are pretty much paying a major premium over an M2 macbook air for a UI/UX experience that COULD be a major game-changer but also likely very early concept.\n\nI hold that at $2000 it might start to get way more people to \"nibble\" at it, and from co-workers it seemed that was the price they had in their head going into the price reveal that would have had them considering it.",

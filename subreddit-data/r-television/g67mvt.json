First, putting Leno at 10 was a calculated move that would cost the network viewers but work out since it would be so much cheaper than five nights of scripted dramas. Zucker then blamed Conan for the dropoff of Tonight Show viewers despite the much weaker lead-in.\n\nLeno had a \"good soldier\"/typical Boomer mindset, NBC had been good to *him*, by the time he realized how badly it was screwing over someone else and that he was a party to it, it was too late and the damage had been done. Conan deserved another run at the Tonight Show with a stronger lead-in, Leno deserved to be sent off to do Jay Leno's Garage without the damage to his reputation of this shitshow, and Zucker deserved to be kicked out of the  TV business rather than failing up.",

He gets absolutely shafted by the networks and Leno himself, goes on to murder it at TBS. \n\nShowing his characteristic self-deprecating lack of ego and ability to laugh at himself, he genuinely appears to not give a fuck about these events some might simply see as misfortunes. That's not why his fans still appreciate him, it just makes it easier to. I will be a lifelong fan of Conan O'Brien because he's funny.\n\nWe already know a good portion of how he torments his staff anyways.\n\nEdit:          Andy Richter is god.",

She ended up going against the adoption place and talked about  them in her show and how horrible they were. The doggy place tried to explain that they have rules and regulations in place for a reason, but Ellen went on about it for a long time, as if she had been deeply insulted. That\u2019s when I decided that I don\u2019t like her. I think this was a time when the warpath mentality you mentioned leaked into the public.",

In case anyone is curious; she adopted from a rescue but decided to give the dog away because it didn't get along with her cats. Part of the agreement she signed was to return the dog to the rescue if there were issues like that, but she either ignored or didn't bother to read that condition. The woman running the rescue found out and confiscated the dog from the family Ellen gave it to, considering the rescue could not vouch that the family would be suitable owners. Ellen responded to this by using her show to bad mouth the rescue and demand they return the dog to the family. She garnered sympathy for the family by saying their children had already fallen in love with the dog and \"think of the children!\" \n\nThis asshole did not follow policy and was responsible for breaking those children's hearts, not the rescue. There's no question the rescue was doing what was best for the dog and shouldn't have made an exception for a celebrity. That poor woman's work and reputation was tarnished on a national scale and she even got death threats. That's fucked up",

My dress attire isn't from a bespoke shop but it was a simple suit and tie.  I'll mention now that the jacket is a bit big as I had lost weight \n\nSitting down to our meal my wife asks me under her breath if that is Ellen sitting behind us.  I look and see enough it is.  Not wanting to cause a scene we giggle about how fancy we are. Midway though serving dinner we hear her talking to the waiter about how slow the service is.  There waiter apologise and offers to to get a manager etc.  A few moments later someone in a chef kit is talking with her and waves in a bottle or two of something.\n\nFinishing up our meal we get up and both gawk quickly at Ellen just as it's our first big celebrity sighting ever.  She sees us but quickly looks sour and picks up her phone.  We leave and head to the street to catch a Uber.  After standing around for three minutes a few security guards for the plaza approach us telling us that were soliciting and making the clients nervous.  Telling them were waiting for our Uber att the street the guard informs us that they had been called to ask us off the property by someone with per se.  \n\nWe move a bit closer to street and our Uber is arriving as Ellen and her friend walk outside and her friend screams at us to get a life and that she'd have us arrested for stalking.  Ellen grilled my wife angrily and was very clearly saying something to her body guard who approached us with security.\n\nWe got in our Uber and left",

            "comment": "DUDE FINALLY. \n\nI have been posting about my experience with her for years. Not that it was substantial at all, but it was enough to rub me the wrong way that I started looking into more negative stories about Ellen.\n\nBasically - I was interviewing for a gig on the Warner Bros lot in 2012-2013, and I was waiting in the lobby of one of the offices. I was not interviewing with Ellen, but she came out into the lobby with 3 or so other people. She had like a very deadpan look on her face, etc.. but she looked over at me and started at me for a second, so I kinda smiled and gave a quick wave. She rolled her eyes and made a kind of disgusted face. I was a bit put off by it and surprised, but thought ehh everyone has bad days...? One of the women following her gave her a drink which Ellen literally just took in hand, looked at, and gave it back to her and said \"Wrong\" before turning back to the person handing her what I assumed was her script, all without even looking at her assistant. \n\nIt was just so off-putting, you really realize that her TV persona is literally just a character and she is nothing like the show or her \"values\" that she preaches. \n\nWhen I actually interviewed, it was in a tiny room (less than 10x10) and had 3 desks crammed into it. It was this team that was working on the \"heads up\" game or whatever, and they all looked miserable. \n\nShe's easily one of the most fake and self righteous people in Hollywood. The only people she actually gives a shit about are other celebrities to keep them coming onto the show. I always find it funny how she got some award for being like a pioneer of TV or something at the last Emmys (I think, maybe Golden Globes?) and she got super emotional about how great she was. She's such a self absorbed hack. The way she treats her employees is just more proof.\n\nThe don\u2019t meet your heroes thing is often true, but even then when I was in LA I met a number of celebrities that were just normal chill people. She\u2019s easily the most \u201cstuck up\u201d seeming one I ran into.",

However, it was basically never that you felt his words were aimed at hurting anyone or causing issues at work. He was just loud and colorful and was totally fine with skipping pleasantries to cut to the chase and get work done. He'd also be up for sitting around and telling some great stories from his past and getting to know everyone and be a decent person.\n\nThe other would do sort of similar stuff. All told, I still liked him. The big difference, to his detriment, was a lot of his joking or attempts at not rushing work matters felt fake. Everything was \"no rush,\" but it needed done ASAP. Hearing him yell wasn't uncommon. Jokes came off a lot less joking than they would from others.\n\nThere's really truth in \"actions speak louder than words,\" especially in the workplace. Telling people things aren't a big deal while running around with your hair on fire about every little thing isn't a good look.",

She was forced to go around and say sorry to each of the 'small' people she'd demeaned and shouted at that day. It was quite fun to watch apparently lol.",

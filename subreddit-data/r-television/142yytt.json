They purposely put Messing in clothing that would highlight her small cup size, and she played it up hysterically. One of the best episodes of the series was when Grace got a water bra to make her boobs bigger to impress a guy at an art gallery, and they popped and ruined a bunch of paintings. Execs really need to stay in the office and out of the scripts.",

I remember once hearing an actress describe difficulties with those kinds of jokes in a role, because you can shrug off insults about your character, but insults about your character's body are still insults about *your* body.\n\nI can't imagine the kind of confidence an actress would need to push back on that kind of pressure when it could make or break your entire career (while other actresses making it big around you have gone for the surgery)",

But it's very rarely *popular*. In the world of art-for-art's-sake, big boobs aren't usually meaningful. If you want to translate that art into money, the smart money is to bet on big boobs.",

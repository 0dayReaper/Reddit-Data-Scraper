    "postText": "Warning: spoilers for the entire run of Better Call Saul\n\nTo start, I eagerly anticipated Better Call Saul when the show runners stated that they would be doing an entire series centered on Saul, who was probably my favorite character (and one of the best acted) in Breaking Bad.\n\nOnce it came out, however, it was hard to get into. And, with each new season, I discovered that I had to rewatch the whole series from the beginning each time because I had such trouble retaining the plot. I'm not sure if that's a function of me not being interested in the plot or if the plot was just too intricate.\n\nNow that it's ended and I have had some time to sit with it, I have to say that, as a whole, I didn't love it. There were plot lines and individual scenes that I loved, but it didn't really come together for me as a masterpiece like Breaking Bad did. For one, I didn't find the devolution of Jimmy into Saul convincing. I understand that prequels are intrinsically difficult because you have to write to a pre-destined outcome, but, despite 6 seasons of character development, the show did not sell me on the Saul we got in Breaking Bad. (Before anyone chimes in to say that \"Saul\" was a coping mechanism for the heartbreak he endured when Kim left, I know--it still didn't convince me.) Also, I feel like we didn't spend enough time with Breaking Bad-era Saul. I would have loved to see at least a few episodes with him fully in that skin.\n\nFor another, I was not as enamored with Kim as most viewers were. I think I understood what the show was going for her with her character (that she was as much an antihero as Jimmy was), but I found her story more frustrating/disappointing than I did interesting. Whereas I understood why Jimmy did the unethical things he did, I couldn't understand why Kim did much of the things she did. For example, when she became disillusioned with the type of work she was doing and then she actively lied to and worked against the interests of her client Mesa Verde. If there is one paramount pillar of the practice of law, it is the attorney-client relationship. Regardless of Kim's personal beliefs about her client, she would know that working against her client is the worst thing that an attorney can do. And before you say that I am missing the point and that Kim doing this was an example of her fall from grace, I would say that I found it uninteresting and confounding. It didn't make me think, \"oh wow. Kim really hates \"the man\" and she really wants to bring down \"the man\" using whatever means at his disposal.\" It made me think, \"ugh, Kim is a terrible lawyer.\" And I'm pretty sure the show didn't want me to think that.\n\nLastly, and I know I am going to get the most shit for this, but I didn't find Bob Odenkirk as good here as in Breaking Bad. The final episode, in particular, I found did not showcase his talents well, and, if he wants to win the Emmy, I don't think he should submit this episode if he wants any chance of beating the Succession crew.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted (Beneke) talk.",

            "comment": "I think the central aspect that made Kim 'click' for me was her fear of abandonment. Jimmy is all she has in life. No friends, no family, just work and Jimmy. So, when Jimmy starts to pull away from her after his episode in the desert, she makes a hard turn into scheming. Up until then, she was a balancing force in Jimmy's life...but then they just become bad for eachother. \n\nAs for her working against her client, I think the plot was pretty clear that she was trying to come to a solution that would work best for everyone. It's why she's so mad a Jimmy when he goes rogue against her. She has a true sense of justice and wants to see it enacted. Hence why she prefers the pro bono work. It's what makes her downfall to devastating - she really betrayed her own integrity. (I felt, watching the bus scene, that was a major aspect of her breakdown - just the shear tragedy of what she had done to herself, of the potential future she had destroyed.)\n\nAs for her self-destructive tendencies, it rang very true for me. You live enough years and you see where they are hidden within yourself and the people around you. It isn't portrayed very often in tv (or when it is, it is dialed up to an eleven, a la Walter White), maybe because it is too an uncomfortable a truth for our entertainment.\n\nI do have some of the same feelings regarding Jimmy's arc. For basically the reasons you say, it just felt a little too rushed and sudden. Also, Jimmy was such a kind soul from the beginning, it became an almost impossible task to get him to Saul. I totally see what they did, and they did their best - Jimmy always wanted to project a certain confidence, and was incapable of dealing with grief/loss. It is telegraphed after Chuck's death. He projects his pain onto Howard. So, after Kim leaves, he collapsed into himself and becomes a hollow husk. It's all there on the page, but I never totally bought it. Like you say, maybe with a few more episodes (or even an extra season) that could have been fleshed out more. That said, I see why they didn't, because I really think it was the story of Jimmy AND Kim, so once she leaves, it doesn't feel right to focus on Saul's story.\n\nAll that said, I don't know how it could have been any different. As much as I say I never totally bought the Saul transition, there was so much that I loved about the structure of that last season that I'd hate to see it different. I think, really, that Odenkirk's portrayal of Jimmy was so likeable that I was never going to buy him as the Saul from BB. \n\nAnd I totally disagree about his performance in the finale. Up there, for me, among the most affecting conclusions I've ever seen. Even as I sit here writing I feel the same cocktail of emotions that I did watching it all those months ago. True definition of an ending that 'sticks with you'.\n\nAnd I loved the intricate storytelling. For me, a much more enjoyable watch than BB. Breaking Bad was a super fun watch, it was plotted like a steam train and kept you engaged, but for my sensibilities the more relaxed and character driven nature of BCS was more satisfying.",

A good attorney may try to get their client on board with doing something that is both in their interest and in the interest of the other party, but, Kim went way beyond that into actively and secretly working against her client with the opposing party. If Kim wanted to do what was in the interest of justice instead of what was in the interest of her client, then she should have quit the moment she realized she couldn't be a zealous advocate for her client, but she didn't. That makes her a terrible lawyer.",

I mean, HHM weren't acting on behalf of their clients by dragging out the settlement, but were acting in self interest. District attorney's often are motivated by political and career ambition, not especially enacting justice. \n\nKim always had a natural sense of justice, probably why she went into law, and was hitting friction between ideals and career ambition. And she does, as it turns out, quit her job for that very reason.\n\nIt all feels very consistent character-wise. Is your issue with a show depicting an conflicted person wrestling with moral dilemmas?",

And someone who took the law and her role as an attorney seriously. More so than probably any other character (except maybe Chuck).\n\nAnd I would argue that what Kim did (colluding with Jimmy to obstruct the construction of the Mesa Verde branch) way worse than what HHM did. It's something that not even Jimmy had done. \n\nUltimately, it's just my personal view that Kim's character arc wasn't as interesting to me as it was for others. I'm pretty sure the Mesa Verde storyline was supposed to get me to see Kim as in the right and plant the seeds of her doing pro bono work, but it had the opposite effect on me.",

Not sure if it's because that stuff resembled Breaking Bad more, but that's what I found compelling.  Jimmy/Saul's story was too slow of a burn for me. It also kind of seemed like two completely different shows that crossed over every once in a while.  I guess it all culminated somewhat well in the end, but I'm not crazy about that format going on for an entire 6 seasons.",

I tend not to go back to those two, but they weren't all bad. \n\nSame story with Sanford and Son, which is probably all around a bit better. The Jeffersons was great for about 5 or 6 seasons. So there are your main Black Norman Lear sitcoms. \n\nIf you haven't seen it, you'll probably love Living Single, too, since it's more female-centric and a couple of decades newer.\n\nA Different World is also a must! Season 1 is its own beast, though.",

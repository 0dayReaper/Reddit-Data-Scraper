I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.\n\nAccording to industry metrics, private investment in the internet has exceeded $1.5 trillion dollars since 1996, leading to the creation of millions of jobs, economic prosperity, and a society where the accessibility of information is at a level unimaginable merely two or three decades ago.\n\nIn 2015, the Federal Communications Commission voted in secret to reclassify broadband internet access services as \u201ctelecommunication services\u201d under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This allowed the government to regulate the internet under the same rules designed for telephone companies in the 1930s, hampering innovation and growth in that industry for more than fifty years.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s 2015 edict requires Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to treat all data traveling over their networks equally, rather than allowing ISPs to customize service offerings with their users and compete for more customers on the basis of quality and price, even if those service offerings include treating some data differently. This essentially imposes a one-size-fits-all business model on the internet and represents an unprecedented government power grab to control and regulate the internet.\n\nAs you may know, Chairman Pai\u2019s released a plan to overturn the FCC\u2019s 2015 mandates, which clearly ran contrary to Congressional intent. The FCC is set to vote on the plan on December 14, 2017, and I am in support Chairman Pai\u2019s desire to overturn these mandates. Early this year, I cosponsored S. 993, the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would scrap the FCC\u2019s ill-founded interpretation and net neutrality mandates.\n\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to contact me. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other issues that are important to you.\n\n\n\nSo basically a bunch of bullshit. In my area (and probably most other people\u2019s area) we only have one internet provider, so not much competition for them to keep it affordable for everyone. ",

There's nothing wrong with that, and in this case, for some reason, the Republican party has aligned itself against net neutrality. So this is a predictable result of the last election. \n\nSo, in addition to Pai and his two commiserating commissioners, we can blame the president for nominating them and the senate for confirming them.

                    "comment": "Sorry to say, but this won't do jackshit. The ship has sailed. The FCC doesn't schedule votes unless it knows the outcome, and neither O'Rielly nor Carr is budging. Carr has a mind-meld with Pai on most all issues, and O'Rielly's actually a bit to Pai's right and doesn't like the FCC making any rules that Congress hasn't expressly authorized. Yeah, Obama appointed him, but Obama also appointed Pai. The way   minority nominations\u2014as in, the two commissioners from the party that doesn't hold the White House\u2014to the FCC generally work is, the party in the Senate picks somebody they think the president can live with, and the president rubber-stamps them. Rosenworcel was technically \"hired by Trump\" (well, hired back\u2014she was a commissioner in the Obama days and got forced off after Senate Republicans and then, kinda, Tom Wheeler screwed her over), but she's become a huge voice opposing Pai on issues like net neutrality.\n\nAnd if that's not enough for you, I've actually talked, in person, to both O'Rielly and Carr in the last couple days to triple-check that their votes are locked in. They are. Not disclosing my identity beyond saying that I'm a tech policy reporter and go crazy seeing the internet be wildly misinformed about this stuff (I was also at the dinner this video is from).\n\nSo what can you do? Right this second, not a whole lot. The vote's happening. Nobody's having a Grinch-style last-second change of heart. Within weeks, as soon as the order is published in the Federal Register, there will be a lawsuit (well, multiple lawsuits in all likelihood, but they'll get consolidated into one). That'll take years to work its way through court, first at two stages of the appellate level and then potentially before the Supreme Court. It's probably 2020 or later before we know if this gutting of the rules is going to stick. The FCC might be vulnerable here, but it might not. If Trump gets one or more additional Supreme Court picks beyond Gorsuch, things look especially good for Ajit Pai, but it's too early to say much of anything about litigation odds.\n\nWhat you need to be doing if this stuff matters to you is raising hell with your member of Congress and senators. Part of the strategy in having Pai go this far was so that Republicans in Congress could force Democrats to come to the table on a bill that would at least create some net neutrality rules, albeit nothing as strong as the ones Pai is killing. If there's legislation, net neutrality policy is permanent and the next Democrat-controlled FCC can't just come in and reverse Pai just as he's reversing Tom Wheeler. Right now, Democrats aren't budging because they don't trust Republicans to make rules that will actually protect net neutrality.\n\nIf you support net neutrality, you may want it to stay that way, at least until Republicans are out of power. If Dems can retake the House or Senate in 2018, your chances of getting Title II-style rules back go up substantially, though even a Dem sweep in both houses would still be facing Trump's veto pen. If the Democrats control both the White House and at least one of the House or Senate after 2020, you might get permanent net neutrality rules on the books once and for all. I am not telling anyone how to vote; I'm just describing the only path back to strong net neutrality rules that doesn't depend on the FCC losing in court. \n\nOutside of voting, calls and letters can actually be somewhat effective, or at least more so than silence. I have it on good authority that a number of powerful Republicans were rattled by how upset their constituents got after the GOP voted early this year to undo the Obama FCC's online privacy protections.\n\nBut yeah, your emails to commissioners are going straight to a spam folder and not doing a damn thing. Read up, stay angry, stay involved. That's about all you can do at the moment.",

This is more than likely a case for the commerce clause to allow Congress to step in and regulate above the head of the FCC - the caveat is that a Republican Congress won't do this, and it's likely we won't see any real change until congress flips. This fight for Net Neutrality won't end with this FCC killing it. Until it's ratified as an amendment, voted into law, or taken to the Supreme Court, the fight won't end. Ultimately, the ISPs have everything to lose, and that's why they're trying so hard to get rid of it. Once it becomes law or a SC precedent is set, they can't fight it.",

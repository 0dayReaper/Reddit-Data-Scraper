    "postText": "I am observing this Emmy season and I am seeing how much of a contender the Dahmer show is becoming especially for Evan Peters who played Jeffrey Dahmer.\n\nNow I found this show very uncomfortable and I didn't even finish it because I was so confused at the angle the show was going at with retelling this horrific story.\n\nIt is good at providing the context of his upbringing and all of that but if I am watching it not knowing how to follow Jeffery Dahmer as a leading character in his story... Am i supposed to understand him, empathise with him or what?? And it also doesn't help that Evan Peters is just so good looking that it become's a major distraction from the point of whatever they tried to do dramatising this story  \n\nNow the angle in their marketing is that they are trying to bring forth a light on the victims, their families, the community and the failure of the justice system in preventing this type of behaviour from happening... But all of those elements seeming like they are a supporting factor in this Dahmer Netflix dramatisation and it doesn't feel like the main thing.\n\nAnyway, the documentary was able to communicate the justice systems failure, impact on families, victims and communities in a much more better and cohesive way... It told this story like it is and so I really dont see why they invested in dramatising it but then again Netflix is boasting that the show generated a billion views or something and so i guess capitalism trumps the cultural insensitivity of a show like this when documentaries literally exist.",

Some people prefer a more dry true crime-style documentary, some people prefer more a more dramatized play-style approach. \n\nDo agree the timing of it all was kind of weird.",

I've seen a bunch of stuff on Dahmer, but this was the first time I've felt something beyond sadness and anger. Monster was able to bring forth the fear and desperation associated with him.",

The funny thing is that almost no golfer in the PGA got a heads up at all. And many of them didn't want to go to LIV as a protest against Saudi policies and killing a journalist. So...the question is will this people walk out of the PGA now that the Saudi fund is in control of the finical aspect of the PGA? They have one hundred percent control and the right to refuse any additional investors. \n\nI don't watch golf because...well, it is boring as hell to watch, at least to me. But if I watched it, I wouldn't now. And if I was a player on the PGA, I would walk away even at the cost of millions of dollars. I am guessing that the money will make them all fold in, shut their mouths and forget all the crap they slung at LIV trying to put them under. And honestly, I see this as just the start of them sportswashing. Next, they will buy into a new franchise in the NBA. And then buy an NFL team, and maybe an NHL team.",

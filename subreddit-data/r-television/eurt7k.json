He essentially dismissed the possibility of the games selling and opted to take a lump sum of cash instead. I can\u2019t remember how much it was. It wasn\u2019t never work again money, but it\u2019s what he wanted. After a few years, he became a bit upset and felt robbed, I gather, because the games did exceptionally well. There was a pretty public falling out between the two, but I believe CDPR and he settled for some amount and both are happier. On the one hand I can\u2019t blame him for taking the lump sum because CDPR was relatively unknown. But as an unpublished author I\u2019d like to think that, believing in my work, I\u2019d opt for a longer term option. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be bitter if I were in his situation, but it would have been my call so I couldn\u2019t blame anyone but myself.",

Then out of nowhere these bunch of guys pitch the idea of another video game. Their game development resume? Translating Baldur's Gate to Polish.

That all depends on the skill of the translator.\n\nIt can be difficult to convey the same exact **type** or specific **kind** of rhetoric being expressed in the original, but expressing the same **level** of rhetoric is just a matter of the translator having the writing skills to know how to convey those same emotions, style and tone in the target language.\n\nThe words, metaphors and idioms won't be the same but the feeling absolutely could be the same.\n\nA good example of this is Haruki Murakami. Japanese and English couldn't be more different, but the translations always do a pretty good job of conveying the tone, themes and general feeling of the original text.",

Basically, I think anyone who says he made a poor business decision are benefiting from a *lot* of hindsight on the matter.",

For me I think it was the fact that TW1 initially used the same engine as NWN, and was promoted quite heavily by BioWare at the time, which was pretty cool.",

Some foreign publishers are doing me a disservice by painting my books with artwork borrowed from the games, and including game advertisements and game related blurbs inside.\n\n&gt;\"Though I praised the knowledge and familiarity of fantasy readers, there are some among them who have less of it. Sometimes, by looking at the covers, they reject books as game novelizations, products secondary to the game.\"\n\nCan we please read anything after headline, Headlines are mostly misguided and don't tell the whole story.",

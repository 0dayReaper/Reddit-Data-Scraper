The CW got *The Coroner* (CBC), *Trickster* (CBC), and *Family Law* (Global)*.* And NBC grabbed *Transplant* (CTV)*.*\n\nThe CW also imported the European/US-produced (English-language) *Leonardo.* So Nexstar's [current strategy of sourcing non-US shows](https://www.tvguide.com/news/the-cw-fall-tv-shows-2023-the-complete-schedule/) for the CW is just extending what they've already been doing to cover the big gaping hole left by ditching the Berlanti DCU shows (that weren't making money for the network, only for the studio).\n\nWe'll see if they copy Netflix and start bringing in stuff that's not English language and requires subtitles, or if they stick to English-language shows. But the latter path seems the more likely.\n\n\\--edited to add linkage.",

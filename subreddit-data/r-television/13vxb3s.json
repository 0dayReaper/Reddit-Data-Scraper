            "comment": "&gt; **On Tuesday WGA West president Meredith Stiehm sent letters to major shareholders of Netflix and NBCUniversal owner Comcast, urging them to vote against each company\u2019s \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal,** which asks shareholders to sign off on those company\u2019s prior-year pay packages at their respective annual meetings. \n\n**Comcast**\n\n&gt; \u201cApproval of this compensation package is inappropriate in light of the ongoing WGA writers\u2019 strike and the associated risks that Comcast executives are creating for investors,\u201d Stiehm wrote to Comcast shareholders. \u201cShareholders should send a message to Comcast that **if the company could afford to spend $130 million on executive compensation last year, it can afford to pay the estimated $34 million per year that writers are asking for in contract improvements and put an end to this disruptive strike.**\u201d\n\n**Netflix**\n\n&gt;  She struck a similar note with Netflix (albeit with different numbers:**the WGA estimates Netflix would pay writers $68 million per year, twice what Comcast would).**\n\n\n&gt; She also noted the disruptions to production, and what it could mean for the bottom line of the companies.\n\n\n&gt; \u201c**Netflix\u2019s content pipeline has been blocked, with dozens of projects that were in development or ordered to series as of May 1st unable to move forward until WGA negotiations conclude,**\u201d Stiehm wrote to Netflix shareholders. \u201c**A delay in the writing, production, and release of new content may impact Netflix\u2019s ability to attract and retain subscribers and viewers just as the company asks customers to watch advertising and pay more for its content.**\u201d",

I mean seriously, as someone who is okay with capitalism as a system where goods and services are exchanged, I say fuck it. \n\nThe stock market is not the economy. It's a reflection of wealthy oligopolies inexorably tied to landed gentry and robber baron descendants. The actual economy where people exchange their goods and services would exist without them as a fundamental law of societal nature.\n\nIt's like how pure anarchy collapses, inevitably everybody asks how the food, electricity, and sewage systems can keep going. People eventually figure out it can't all be revolution and get back to work\n\nAnd if anyone asks about what about the pension funds and 401ks from a dip in the stock market, I usually ask what system made it so that those are the only real \"safety nets\" we might be able to rely on instead of a well-funded social security and health care system from corporate taxes and regulation that is not under constant threat from token corrupt ideologists and actual insane ideologists.",

People used to be able to tuck away a little bit of every paycheck in a risk-free account with guaranteed predictable returns as a legitimate retirement plan. Those interest rates were slashed from 5% to .05% so the financial industry could force everyone into 401k and pension funds that allowed them to siphon off as much wealth as possible. \u201cTrickle-down economics\u201d is one of the most successful lies ever told, it\u2019s always been Siphon-off economics.",

If you invest 6% and they match 3%, that is a guaranteed rate of 50%.\n\nin my world, 100% and 50% are both much better than 5%, or any historical savings rate.\n\nTo take it even further, the savings rates fluctuate over time based on inflation and interest rates.  So yes, you might get a 5% savings rate, but with inflation, you might net zero.  Savings rates that are to high caused banks too collapse because the promise was greater than their ability to deliver on the promise.  During the last decade, savings rates were .5% because the fed rate was between 0%-2%. The cost of money was super cheap. Today, you can find savings and CD rates at 4+% because the opposite is true.",

You don't become that rich without being enormously greedy. They always need to be making money. Those people can't stand the idea of missing out on making millions of dollars, even if they already have millions of dollars. They also don't have the same sense of solidarity going for them that the writers have. The various studios that make up the AMPTP are direct competitors with one another, and so for them the strike is basically a 300-person version of the prisoners dilemma, where any studios that defect from the AMPTP and strike an independent deal with the WGA before the strike ends get a leg up over any of the studios that don't. \n\nAlso, a lot of the striking writers needed to work second jobs to cover their bills anyway, so they still have some income. On top of that they still get residuals, they have access to the WGA's strike funds, and the strikers in New York are eligible for unemployment benefits.",

Usually a script sale is good for a rewrite step, so let's be nice and throw in the 40k scale pay for that too. 50k total until the movie is produced (if it ever is, which it usually isn't).\n\nAll in all best case scenario you get anywhere from 50k-130k for the gig. Of which 25% goes to your reps (agent, manager, lawyer), so that's automatically downgraded to 37K-95K before taxes.  \n\nAnd here's the thing: that's if you sell a script/ get hired to write one EVERY SINGLE YEAR! There is NO guarantee that you will sell or get hired every year -- in fact, especially early on in your career, you almost certainly won't be booking assignments left and right, and when you do, they're more likely to be for a polish or a low budget deal,  which pays a lot less than what I outlined above.\n\nSo, yes, a working Hollywood writer with a feature film deal with a major Hollywood studio can (and often is) actually be living on like 50K before taxes -- yearly, if they're lucky, but potentially with no other writing-related income over a period of multiple years.\n\n(In LA, where average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment is $2225 as of Feb 2023 per apartments.com.)\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the TV side of the business, which has its own set of (very serious) problems the strike is trying to address.\n\nIt's definitely not 'many hundreds of thousands'.",

A lot of it is that companies used to hire writers for the long term of a show, but now they treat writing as a purely gig job and once the show gets moving they just fire all the writers and demand the show runner basically write the whole series alone after that. They used to be able to train on different aspects of show running and move up. But now they don\u2019t. They\u2019re all treated like temps. They can\u2019t sustain a living wage like that.",

This fund is really helpful to not only writers, but crew, directors, actors, etc as well. And as crew, etc are not striking at the moment, they do not have access to their own strike funds. So funds like these are really important at keeping industry workers afloat since the strike has shut down pretty much every production, and few people in the industry are able to work right now.   \nhttps://entertainmentcommunity.org\n\nEdit:\nThe link stopped working for some reason, so re-linking again:\n\n[Entertainment Community Fund](https://entertainmentcommunity.org)",

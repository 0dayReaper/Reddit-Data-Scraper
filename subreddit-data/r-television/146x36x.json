Whilst I couldn't deny the quality on display, I almost would have preferred for Glover and Hader to have done it in a different show. The first seasons set you up for a certain tone and mood, and what's what I end up liking them shows for.\n\nWhilst I also like the sort of work that went into later seasons of each show, they were the sort of outings where I prefer knowing what I'm going to get going in, so I can be prepared for what's to come and make sure I'm in the right mood.\n\nWith movies this is simple, if I want to want a simple, fun, bombastic movie I can sit down and watch Extraction knowing what I'm going to get. When I want to watch a more 'sophisticated' or 'artsy' movie, I can wait until I'm in the right mood and watch Banshees of Inisherin or Blade Runner 2049.\n\nThe trouble when a show takes a turn part way through is that I'm no longer watching the same sort of show I originally fell in love with, for whatever reasons they were. It's not that I can't like the sort of thing they were now offering me, I'd just rather it be offered elsewhere.\n\nI don't really know how to express what I'm trying to suggest, honestly.",

Like if the show was more 'real' I feel like it would have been a season or two shorter and more contained maybe without a definite satisfying ending but having it go on and dragging the characters out like Stephen Root's character who should have been out of the show a couple seasons ago when him and Barry actually had their major conflict of breaking up their work relationship and had him exit there instead of sticking around so they could write more for the character.\n\nAlso the whole idea that Barry couldn't understand that his instructor loved the cop lady, he had no problem thinking of how murder affects the loved ones of people he kills right away after a certain season 1 kill, it feels like a step backwards to have him not be able to get outside his own head and understand how killing affects people. Same thing not sure exactly what I'm trying to suggest but hopefully getting it across",

The goofy personalities of the characters distracts from those traits, but they're as true in the final episode as they were in the first. \n\nCharacters don't have to be likeable for a show to be enjoyable.

I think it's about vengeance. (&gt;!S2, wiping out the gang while trying to kill Fuchs!&lt;) \n\nB-Okay. \n\nG-And then, scene three, whoopsie, you eat the shit pie. Comeuppance. He who seeks revenge digs two graves, Barry. It's a tale as old as time.

All that *can't* be an accident...can it? I'm generally pretty skeptical on these kinds of theories/analysis (Vravo, Bince); but four seasons to the show, four acts to the arc of the character he landed in this scene that all happen to be able to be lined up with what happens to the main characters? I gotta think that's intentional, but I also hadn't heard Hader say he was creating the story as he went along... \n\nHmm, maybe it is just an over-analyzed scene if that's the case \ud83e\udd14 And if it wasn't intentional, that only makes me think Bill Hader is even more genius than he knows, because on *some* (maybe subconscious) level some real broad strokes for the story were laid out/foreshadowed here; now whether or not he meant for that is a very interesting question for sure",

Barry season one was incredible, but the follow up seasons were bumpy and uneven with a lot of leaps in plot and logic that you just had to go with. Sally is really running away with Barry? Gene is really firing a gun through a closed door? And then his son lives but he never talks to him again? The brilliant, calculating father, Jim Moss, lets Barry escape because he suddenly believes Gene was the mastermind? Noho Hank, eight years later and in charge, only brings one missile to take out Fuches and he fires it himself? I mean I get it, it's absurdist, but that's a lot of leaps.",

You want Hank to answer Fuches differently in the final episode, but he can\u2019t. He can\u2019t accept his role in the ruination of his life because none of us ever really can accept the weight. And Barry\u2014 well maybe he is the most honest of them all.

That's what's great about personal preference!\n\nThe last 2 seasons (especially s4) were two of the best runs of a show that I've ever seen. Bill &amp; the writing team were incredibly subversive, yet, honest (to steal a term another poster used) with how they portrayed the characters and their decisions.\n\nAnd don't get me started with the time jump! While many didn't like it, I thought it was an incredible way to move the story along. They took us from point A to point C without showing us the unimportant B plot in the middle. And it wasn't even the first time jump! We saw the same thing between season 2 and 3, however, that was a season-to-season jump as opposed to the mid-season jump in 4.\n\nTrim the fat and give me the good stuff. It was so refreshing!",

But there's a couple of moments I have trouble justifying, and both plot points involve Jim Moss. 1) Jim moss(the human lie detector), believing that Jean somehow manipulated Barry into Killing his daughter. He already interrogated Jean and broke him. Now, all of a sudden he seems to believe Jean contributed to having his daughter killed ? 2) Jim Moss, tying up Barry and having him in his clutches, then leaving him alone and seemingly allowing him to escape. You'd think he'd just have him arrested or killed after he finished torturing him. I understand finding out about Barry giving Jean money changing things but it seemed very loose for a guy whose shown to be the only intelligent, competent person in the whole show.\n\nWould love to hear anyone else's thoughts, whether they agree or disagree with what I'm saying.",

In the first two seasons I thought Barry had a genuine chance at having a better life than one he never asked to be in. Fuches manipulated him and ruined his life and gets rewarded for it in the end ultimately. Barry never got a real chance to be the person he could have been and I feel like season 3 rushed that.",

The show is constantly showing the conflict between who characters believe themselves to be, portray themselves to be and who they actually are. Jim Moss is no different. Jim Moss is portrayed as a \"the ends justify the means\" stereotypical Hollywood cop that gets to the truth no matter the cost.\n\nI think his total oversight here and going after the wrong guy off a single lead and letting the real perpetrator get away is totally fitting with his character. He isn't the competent cop he believes he is. He's just a vigilante torturing people in his garage trying to get revenge.\n\nI think the show is making two statements here with his oversights/mistakes: One, that like all the other characters Jim Moss is fallable and not who he and others think he is. Two, that vigilantes/cops torturing people in their garage trying to get to the bottom of a personal vendetta won't necessarily lead them to the actual truth but just a truth they feel comfortable with and feels conclusive to them. Whatever answer they come to that allows them to close the case will be the one they go with.",

At the end he finds a faction of Christianity that absolves him of his sins. So he sorta drowns himself in it because it\u2019s the only way he can feel like he isn\u2019t a bad person for the things that he\u2019s done, and the only way he can live with himself. But you can see that he doesn\u2019t fully buy into it - he does the steps and paints the picture of a \u201cproper Christian household\u201d - but upon closer examination you can see it\u2019s a facade - Sally\u2019s a drunk, Barry is not good father/husband, and he is immediately ready to go kill Gene (if he had truly changed, surely this wouldn\u2019t have been his route). So I liked it - just another way Barry was trying to find peace",

The time skip was frustrating because it kept showing clues that it was a dream sequence , but was it?  \n\nThe abstract crap like the truck \"clawing\" its way into the house which was in the middle of nowhere, the blood coming out of the eye of that referee or ump...whatever the hell it was. It's also totally unbelievable that the dad changed his mind just like that. \n\nThe first two seasons were amazing though.",

Barry went on a killing spree in season 2, after a whole season of not killing anyone. he went back into the darkness of course seasons 3 and 4 were going to be darker.\n\nidk i think season 3 is the best season of the show, and while 4 doesn't match that height it's still good. overall, it's an amazing show. we can compare it to stuff like Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul or even The Sopranos, but at the end of the day Barry was totally individual. a brutal, audacious and ambitious show that, by some miracle, got to have four seasons.",

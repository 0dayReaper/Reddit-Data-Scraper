There\u2019s nothing\u201dMid\u201d about him.\n\nAnything creative is highly subjective. You like Brandon Sanderson. I haven't ever read any of his original works, because I was a massive Wheel of Time fan, and when RJ passed, and I heard that some author I'd never heard of was finishing his opus, I felt uneasy but I was willing to give it a shot.\n\nThose last three books were tight, succinct, wrapped the plot up, and did away with all the waffle. I did not care for it at all. I loved RJ's waffle. He could spend 3 pages describing a 10 second interaction between a soldier &amp; a woman rolling her eyes at his stupidity. I loved how the plot literally meandered for over a decade. Actually, might have been almost two decades, haha.\n\nI reckon, if I read Sanderson's stuff, I could probably like it. It's just that imo, he was the worst choice to finish WOT. I loved that series &amp; I loved Matrim Cauthon. He was a very different character at the end.",

He can say he doesn\u2019t like his work and that\u2019s fine, but saying he\u2019s mid and will never write anything as good as Sheridan is just dumb.\n\nSo you decided to base your opinion of an author on how he finished the massive series created by another author? That\u2019s a little unfair in my opinion. The fact that he finished up the series and tied everything up well is a gift in my opinion, not very many authors could do that.",

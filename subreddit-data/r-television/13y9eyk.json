Now, stuff noticeably not looking like where it's supposed to be is a bit of a different matter. Like, in your example, if someone watching Dexter lived in Miami and was a bit bothered by how the show keeps insisting it's Miami but it clearly looks nothing like Miami, I'd get that (I have no idea if the show actually looks decently accurate or not). Even then though, you kinda just laugh and get over it. Or at least I do. \n\nBut yeah, just knowing intellectually that The Office isn't filmed on location in Scranton doesn't matter to me any more than knowing that Lord of the Rings wasn't really filmed in Middle Earth. I never expected nor considered they would be in the first place.",

There was an episode of Agents of SHIELD that was set in \"Atlanta\" but obviously not filmed here.  For the bus station lines they used the exact same font and coloring as MARTA, which is local public transportation and not a bus stop you'd get on a bus to go to another city/state.

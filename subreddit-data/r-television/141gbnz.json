    "postText": "Going to start with a couple of examples. When Doctor Who started, the Doctor was an alien. When the actor retired while the show was very popular, they introduced the concept of regenerations to explain the Doctor being played by a new actor. Originally they could only regenerate 12 times (guess they thought 12 at an average of 3 years per regeneration that was enough to never care about it again, show would be cancelled long before that). Eventually they had to change it again because the show is now going into its 15th main Doctor.  \n\nWhen Star Trek Voyager started, being a ship that was teleported way away from known space, initially they had only a limited number of torpedoes (38) with no way to replenish them and were careful on when to use them, until they just didn't care and people counted over 120 torpedoes being fired during the run.",

But the get anti-matter from places over the course of the show. It\u2019s ridiculous to believe they were incapable of building torpedoes at all.\n\nThe replicator is probably one of the biggest changes in the show, though. In TNG it\u2019s clearly capable of recreating anything made of normal matter. Deanna is never like \u201cHey Guinan make me a *real* sundae, none of this replicated ice cream.\u201d  The replicator makes atoms and jams those atoms together and so the thing they make is indistinguishable from the same thing made \u201cnaturally.\u201d  But they needed the Maquis to have a real good reason why they couldn\u2019t just move to another planet so suddenly replicators crapped out shitty food and Sisko\u2019s dad wasn\u2019t a nut for making food by hand.  We\u2019re supposed to believe that latinum is somehow too complex for a replicator to build even though it\u2019s just protons neutrons and electrons. Everything is protons neutrons and electrons.  If you can make one atom you can make any atom.",

Classic Who introduced regeneration - which it originally referred to as a \"renewal\" - when Hartnell left a few stories into season 4 to make way for Troughton. \n\nBut the notion that the Doctor could only regenerate 12 times wasn't introduced until season 14 - more than halfway through the Classic series' 26-year original run - during the Tom Baker story The Deadly Assasin. In fact, it's that story where we get much of the lore about the Time Lords and Gallifrey, including Rassilon and the Eye of Harmony. \n\nI'd argue, furthermore that while it definitely wrote the showrunners into a corner years later, the whole regeneration limit was merely something that was addressed as part of the plot. Clara asks the Time Lords to bestow a new cycle upon the Doctor, which we learn with 13 is endless anyway due to the Timeless Chil reveal. \n\nDoctor Who has introduced plenty of things that it's later gone on to ignore or forget - there's the Unit dating controversy, the Doctor's half-human biology, or the dozen or so times they've \"defeated the Daleks for good.\" The regeneration limit though, was always an issue handled with some level of care once realized it would be an issue.",

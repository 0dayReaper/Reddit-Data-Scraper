Their new home was massive. Gorgeous new place with a room for each kid. The only issue: the family now had to cover utilities for a much larger home.\n\nLighting &amp; Heating a 5 bedroom home is muuuuuch more than a 2 bed. On top of that, their property taxes also increased tenfold. They sold a few years after the makeover- A) because of the increased expenses, and B) their daughter passed of cancer, and they felt as though staying in the house was preventing their ability to grieve &amp; move on.",

Some municipalities have rules on a flat percentage. My city says 1% of total assessed value. Others have a certain amount per $1,000. The city I just moved from had a rate of $17ish per $1,000 of assessed property value.\n\nA lot of folks on this show had very small, bare bones homes, and were gifted massive McMansion style homes. While it\u2019s certainly nice that they have a much nicer home to live in, their property is now worth a hell of a lot more in the eyes of the state.",

It looks largely the same from the front yard &amp; outside as it did 20 years ago. Now inside, it\u2019s much nicer &amp; he\u2019s done a lot of upgrades- finished the basement, gutted &amp; remodeled the kitchen, new floors, central AC, new heating system. But, the only thing you\u2019d be able to tell from the front &amp; outside is a new roof &amp; solar panels. \n\nThis, plus the fact that he\u2019s been the only owner of it since the 90s, it\u2019s extremely hard to tell. It really helps that he doesn\u2019t live in a super nice area. It\u2019s not unsafe, but it\u2019s a block away from a freeway, behind a grocery store, and the schools aren\u2019t very good. He doesn\u2019t plan on selling, so he\u2019s sitting happy. I\u2019m sure if he does sell, he\u2019d probably get double or triple what he payed for the home.",

Like, if you already have to work two jobs alongside your husband who works three jobs in order to afford to keep your 5 disabled children living in a shack, how exactly are you going to find the time to clean the 20-room mansion that they built, let alone find a way to pay for the increased heating/cooling/electric costs? \n\nI saw one episode a bit ago where the overall size and layout of the house was basically fine, the only real problem was that the construction was terrible and moldy and rotting away. So those people would've been fine with basically the exact same house blueprints, just built better, but no they get a gigantic-ass house.",

A charitable effort that focuses on homeowners seems like a non-starter today but that\u2019s just speculation.\n\nI don\u2019t want to discourage charity but this seems like a weird choice for a reboot, that show was notoriously problematic.",

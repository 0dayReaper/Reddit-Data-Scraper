Am I supposed to be excited because it's porn? Because it's controversial? Because it was a huge mess behind the scenes? Why is any of that* appealing?\n\n*obviously I get the appeal of porn. But also. There's actual porn.",

The author of the article is being overly melodramatic. Sex has always existed in the cable space.\n\nBy the way, I also agree with you about The Idol. The trailer\u2019s not doing it for me. It seems to me like this is a more artist centered, erotic but dumbed down version of HBO\u2019s Vinyl. The only appeal I\u2019m getting so far is going through The Idol threads in this sub and being entertained by people\u2019s post arguing about why this show is great or not great, and both grounded and absurd reasons why no one will watch this show. I am seriously enjoying the dumpster fire.\n\nAnyways, I always watch shows and make up my own mind because Reddit can be a bit imbecilic when it comes to judgment, but like I said, the trailer just seems so...bad, and plays into every criticisms laid out by the media.",

    "postText": "Young Sheldon has something that just works much better than its parent show\n\nI don't know what it is exactly about young Sheldon that works for me... I didn't like the Big Bang Theory but I started watching young Sheldon because some scenes started popping up in my reels feed and I thought \"screw it, let's watch it\".\n\nBut I don't know it just had a vibe that reminded me of Boy Meets World or Malcolm in the middle, it feels like a show that is family friendly but can still tackle more real serious problems. I'm still in season 1, but I feel like as the show progresses and the kids get older, the show will deal with more mature issues without being grown up. I like how it's framed from the perspective of childhood innocence, in a way.\n\nIt feels more organic than Big Bang Theory and the characters feel more real... it does very much have that Boy Meets World Vibe with Cory/Sheldon getting themselves into situations or being thrust into real life and getting life lessons by the end, it feels like it has more substance. What made Boy Meets World good is that it grew with Cory but always had more \"adult\" b stories, young Sheldon does the same thing, but I don't think it's imitation, I think that was accidental, so it doesn't feel forced (Unlike Big Bang Theory am I right?), yes it does suffer from the \"nerdy thing is a joke\" like in its parent show but unlike its parent show it uses it to alienate Sheldon from his family and peers while still being in a loving family, rather than just \"insert science thing\".\n\nAlso, the kid who plays Sheldon does a great job.\n\nThis is a first impression just by the first half of season one.\n\nedit: i also like how it's set in texas... it reminds me of something Ashton Kutcher said when he was making the ranch, and how its a shame that networks dont make shows about rural america or the midwest (or the south) its always about suburban/urban east/west coast families/friends which is what drove him to make the ranch",

Good cast: Annie Potts, Craig T Nelson, Wallace Shawn, Laurie Metcalf's daughter (forget her name), the dad character, the child Sheldon character. Jim Parsons does the voice over narration a la Wonder Years, Everybody Hates Chris.",

Young Sheldon has such \"heart\", it's about families and bonds and love and overcoming things together. \n\nI watch almost no network TV, but it's one of the two broadcast shows I love (the other being Ghosts, for the same exact reason). \n\nI'm glad you're enjoying it!",

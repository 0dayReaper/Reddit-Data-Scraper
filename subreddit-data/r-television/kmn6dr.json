IRL we'd expect a lazy guy like Homer to be unsuccessful, and a hard worker like Grimes to find success. But the outcomes are both reversed, and that's funny. And of course, they're each as successful as the writers make them. Homer's the heart of the franchise -- he needs a certain baseline of economic stability from which to launch his crazy get-rich-quick schemes, pay for his frequent vacations abroad, etc. While Frank is a one-episode-wonder, so you can guess how that would go.\n\nOn the other hand, when the show began in 1989, it was still somewhat plausible that someone could have (barely) graduated from high school in a company town, walked right into a prosperous employer that could never get offshored. And that graduate could snag a decent, middle-class job with no college degree, no prior experience to speak of, not even any military service. It's quite a bit less plausible that this person could *keep* his job when he's constantly falling asleep at work, and with no union protections backstopping him... but again, this is a comedy where the status quo will always stay in place.",

I just got an extremely lucky break after working bullshit non union HVAC jobs that one of my teachers put up a job opening on the white board for a union position looking for someone who knew HVAC. These jobs exist but they are mostly trades, and mostly manual labor but they do exist. Also most people dont realize at the turn of the century nearly every industry had a union even down to retail employees. Any job CAN be unionized it's just an uphill battle trying to get one started before management squashes it down. I dont know where I was trying to go with this I just think more people should join a union to help fight the massive inequality were seeing now a days",

The matriarch, the stern one, the one who keeps her head on and constantly whips them into place or cleans their messes (if they clean their own a big priority is \"so mom don't find out\") Even Hal fear/respects her.\n\nSo cut to the intro where she's cleaning the living room and knocks over a flower pot, spilling dirt all over.\n\nShe Mom's up and starts cleaning the hell out of it. Vacuum, scrub, scrub again, vacuum again. After a short montage she's got the spot *perfect*. Immaculately white. And as she stands up to admire it she realizes.. oh no. It's an immaculately white spot when the *entire carpet* is dirty and yellowish.  She's now made a clean spot that sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nSo. She checks her left.. her right .. No one around. She grabs the pot and pours dirt all over her freshly cleaned spot and *rubs it in so it matches the rest of the dirty carpet*\n\n10/10 Most relatable show ever",

Then the home owner shows up and Malcom realizes he helped a guy rob a house. The police show up as the homeowner is screaming at Malcolm and he lists off everything he helped load, realizing that all of it is used to make counterfeit money, and the home owners get arrested. Then Malcolm breaks down on the street curb crying. \n\nReese and Dewie try to capitalize on the neighborhood hating them by charging the neighbor hood kids to let them beat the crap out of Reese while he is blindfolded so he can't retaliate later, but Dewie is supposed to secretly whisper the kids name to Reese, only instead Dewie starts beating the crap out of him instead... Except Reese grabbed some random kid and put a bag over his head to take his place, and is in the rafters of the garage watching the events and gets pissed at Dewie, only for the garage door to open, knocking Reese out of the rafters, snagging his shirt and leaving him hanging expensed and helpless whole all the neighborhood kids run into the garage and start hitting him with sticks that make the candy he bought earlier in the episode (using all the kids money) fall put of his pockets like a pinata.\n\nHal and Lois get into a fight at the begining of the episode and argue through out  the day, eventually both joining a sausage eating contest and realizing how much they love each other as they out eat everyone else in the contest, sharing the last sausage like the lady and the tramp, while all of the neighbors watching realizes they hate each other just as much as they hate Malcolm's family. And the block party disperses as they all argue amongst themselves.\n\nFinally Malcolm is still depressed. Dewie goes to throw popcorn in a bounc house, Reese wants to ride the ferris wheel, and the parents go to have sexy time.\n\n.... Iirc",

He encourages them to be themselves and to help take care of their parents, ultimately grateful for the path they set him out on. \n\nWe start to see that later on in the show as each character grows up. Every member of the family starts becoming more independent in a way: Reece embraces cooking; Malcolm stops trying to be as cool as his older brothers; Dewey learns to speak up for himself and acknowledges the differences between he and Malcolm; Hal becomes more decisive and less reliant on Lois' parenting; and Lois relaxes her grip on the family a bit and accepts that things will be OK. \n\nGoddamn what a good show.",

It apparently was an episode in the 15th season. I'm not 100% sure why they placed that example there, but if it's to prove they were \"comfortable\", why not talk about when [they bought a pool on a whim](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bart_of_Darkness)?\n\n&gt;They also occasionally get a peek into a different kind of life. In Season 2, Homer buys the hair-restoration product \u201cDimoxinil.\u201d His full head of hair gets him promoted to the executive level, but he is demoted after Bart accidentally spills the tonic on the floor and Homer loses all of his new hair. Marge finds a vintage Chanel suit at a discount store, and wearing it grants her entr\u00e9e into the upper echelons of society.\n\nThose are your two examples? How the fuck do you not include [Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F) where they discover, visit, and bankrupt Homer's long lost brother WHO OWNS A FUCKING CAR COMPANY? Pork chops whenever you want!\n\nI think the biggest miss in the article is failing to mention how different [Homer Goes To College](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Homer_Goes_to_College) would be today.\n\nAfter a surprise inspection by a government regulator determines Homer isn't qualified for his job, Burns pulls strings to enroll Homer at Springfield University (and presumably pays for it? They never bring up cost in the episode).\n\nRewatching this 27 years later, I was struck by two things:\n\n1. Inspection by a government regulator? Most of our regulatory agencies have been hollowed out and are too short-staffed to do anything other than the bare minimum.\n\n2. You have a person in a necessary role that he's not qualified for? Easy fix, fire that person and hire someone qualified. But Mr. Burns, demonstrated to be about as cruel as humanly possible, never even considers this as an option. Maybe it's because that's prohibited by the union? Who knows...",

Only he never got that wonderful life, and was left fatrher and farther behind.

They actually made an effort to show what life was like for average americans. I saw my brothers, my friends, neighbors, my parents through the lens of that show. Absolutely fantastic every which way. Wish it was still on netflix. From the parents struggles, to the kids lives, everything was pretty much exactly how I remember the working class lifestyle. Hard, fast, stressful but beautiful.",

Forgetting the fact that Homer's income was more than likely played for a joke *and* ignoring the fact that Homer's dad gave him money towards the house, they really make it seem like being the head of safety at a nuclear power plant would be a low paying job. Watching shows like Roseanne or Married With Children confused the hell out of me growing up, because my mother was working two jobs at one point, and we were 5 deep in one bedroom duplex. You never really see that on tv, but they always play it off like Al had a sustainable life as a shoe salesman bringing home less than 40 bucks a month.   \n\nI just finished watching Married with Children again, and there is no way in the world he would have been able to afford that house. Not a chance. There is tv poor and real life poor, and tv almost never shows what being poor in real life is like. Hell, shows can't even show neighbors on any level of parity. \n\nTake Family Guy for example. Quagmire is a pilot, and the average income in 99(the year the show started) would have been anywhere from 60k-160k, and we can put him in the middle. Cleveland was a small business owner, and Joe was an injured police officer with years on the force. All of them could live in the neighborhood, no problem. But Peter? A line worker at a toy factory, with 3 kids and wife that occasionally gives piano lessons. That house has a bedroom for each child, and 2 cars in the garage. There is no way in hell they could pull that off in the real world, but you see this sort of thing all the time on television. I can give a pass to Married With Children, in the real world two investment bankers with no children should way, *way* out earn in a month what Al makes in, like, a decade. But they are played off as young yuppies, so it could be they bought that house because it was dirt cheap, and they could fix it and flip it. \n\nThere is a real life problem with housing, there is no denying that. But using sitcoms as a comparison is just not a reasonable position. If we really wanted to go that route, just look at the early seasons of the Simpsons. If we take Homer's pay used in this article as a fact, then the Simpsons were in constant trouble of being homeless. Early seasons showed things like Homer being broke, struggling to pay for a Vet bill, not being able to afford cable, and of course Lisa needs braces. They were living outside of their means, so I guess that is still attainable if you want.",

Sure, it's cheaper to buy and cook your own, but they also usually show them working more than one job.

But they are played off as young yuppies, so it could be they bought that house because it was dirt cheap, and they could fix it and flip it.\n\nI think the currently exploding income inequality plays into this perception though.  I grew up in an unremarkable neighborhood - neighbor across the street sold industrial kitchen supplies, next door neighbor owned a florist shop, best friend down the block had parents who owns two dry cleaners.  My own household had a single income of a middle school teacher (grandfather) and one full-time homemaker (grandmother).\n\nBut around the corner from us was a family where both parents were physicians (with their two kids).  Their house was a bit nicer, they had a pool, but in the end it was still just a 1700-2000 square foot ranch home with some better decor.  I never felt like they didn\u2019t belong, or that we didn\u2019t belong living next to two doctors.  \n\nToday I think a neighborhood with so much fiscal integration would be rare.  Two physicians would probably make ten times as much as a school teacher now (or more), but I don\u2019t think that was the case in the 80s.",

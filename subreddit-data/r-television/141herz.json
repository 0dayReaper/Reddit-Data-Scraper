I\u2019m very struck by that,**\u201d she told ITV hosts Julie Etchingham and Tom Bradby. \n\n&gt; In what was comfortably the most complained about moment on British TV this year, **viewers said they found the comments offensive and said they amounted to racial discrimination.**\n\n\n&gt; **Ofcom has decided, however, that no further action is necessary as the regulator continues to emphasize the importance of freedom of expression on UK television.**\n\n&gt; Reflecting on her remarks the day after the Coronation, **Andoh told BBC Radio 4 that she did not intend to offend viewers.**",

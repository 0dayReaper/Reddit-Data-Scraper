(Which I think they actually haplessly called the \u201cdrunk rink\u201d) I mean, even so, it made no mention of why Willy is doing the job, or\u2026. Why any of\u2026 ugh. Why am I trying to explain character and plot driven comedy. Why am I even wasting my time explaining why this sucked. I\u2019m just going to get downvoted for pointing it out. \n\nAlso, that wasn\u2019t a coen brothers reference as much as it was a Noah Hawley reference. Not that it matters either way because it was so unfunny.\n\nAnd please know that I went in with an open mind. I fought after the ten minute mark, to TRY to find the funny, and it just wasn\u2019t there man. Just a big shitty conceptual reference guest star crap-fest.",

It\u2019s my favourite show of all time, and I\u2019m bummed that it sucks.\n\nBut again, you\u2019re correct. People can like whatever they want, even if it sucks. That episode was like, basically a family guy concept episode. \n\nIf you\u2019re like \u201cJeez, calm down bro, you\u2019re too intense\u201d, I get it. But you gotta understand. I was raised in the golden age of Simpsons. It *taught* me humour. It is still the funniest joke per minute show of all time at it\u2019s best. So, watching these new episodes is like, watching a loved one slowly die.\n\nIt breaks my fucking heart",

I remember watching a new episode that was terrible and just sat there kinda perplexed by how bad it was. \n\nI just stopped watching it and checked in every now and then to see if it picked up. \n\nNone of this is that serious though. The good episodes will never go away, so we\u2019ll always have Paris.",

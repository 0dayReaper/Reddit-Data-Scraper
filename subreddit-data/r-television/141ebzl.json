My pops was a scout during this time and knew a lot of these guys, and I grew up hearing stories, so seeing some them come to life was awesome. But John C. Reilly is worth the cost of admission, alone. He just absolutely crushes this role (cue someone bringing up who was originally cast, yada yada\u2026)",

The fact that I liked it so much despite all that is an enormous compliment to the quality of the storytelling. The incredibly engaging and believable performances, the extremely well-told underdog story, the absolutely perfect execution of the setting and the time period. I couldn't believe how much I loved it. I'd be more surprised to hear that someone didn't like it. I could watch John C. Reilly sleazing around the 70's with his shirts getting increasingly more comically unbuttoned forever.",

Your life is just run on instinct.\n\nFrom someone who's been in a similar place, friends and family don't tend to notice because they can't stand to think about it. It's not an active choice on their part, more like mental self defence. I don't judge them for it. \n\nI lived a perfect life 5 years ago. Had more money than I knew how to spend, ran a successful business, was married to a kind man, had a wellbehaved lovely little boy, and every night I dreamt about dying. How easy it would be. Just \"lose control\" of the car one morning and drive into a tree. Or \"fall\" off a building (I was in construction). In my case, it wasn't chemical but situational depression. I should've been happy, but I wasn't, and I felt unable to change it.\n\nI sold my company for practically nothing but reassurance that my workers would keep their jobs. I left my marriage and hurt my kid in doing so. I felt so horribly selfish for a long time, but I got out of it. And I'm better now. I have a crappy rundown apartment I can't afford to fix up, the guy I'm with is also getting his life on track, but I'm actually happy here.\n\nWhat I'm saying is; if it's your life bringing you down, change it. You can. If you don't really know why you feel this way, it could be chemical and you might need medication. Get them. The first ones you try might not work and side effects can be shit, but keep trying. If you want to, message me and we can talk about it.\n\nI hope you feel better. I know how hard it is needing to do all this stuff when you barely have the energy to get out of bed. You can though. I know you can.",

There is a lot of fighting between the staff in that episode because the patient is a soldier that fought/fights in the Iraq war. \n\nSince Kelso is a veteran himself, they start talking, and the soldier tells him about how they all hate their supervisor(can't remember the right word), and how that unites them. So Kelso revokes their employee discount so that the staff unifies against him.",

Kelso calls, Janitor answers as the Chief of Medicine, releases it's Kelso and puts Teddy on the phone, and gets him in trouble. \n\nHe honestly played this role to perfection.

It is great for learning more behind-the-scenes stuff, though, like Christa Miller slipping John C. McGinley the tongue during a kiss (when John brought it up to Bill Lawrence, the show creator and Christa's husband, his response was \"Well? Did you like it?\"). Also, listening to the banter between Zach and Donald is just heartwarming; these two are just as much friends off the set as J.D. and Turk were.\n\nThey've also been bringing in guests to discuss the show, too. So far, they've brought in Bill Lawrence, Sarah Chalke, John C. McGinley, and Judy Reyes. Personally, I'm waiting for Ken Jenkins and Neil Flynn to make an appearance; I want to see Zach and Donald pick their brains on how they played their characters.",

Easily the best workplace comedy of all time maybe best sitcom imo. Sam Lloyd was amazing as Ted and the world is slightly worse for his passing but the world is overall better because he was here.

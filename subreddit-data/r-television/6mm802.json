They do not need to bring her back, it's a story better left untold so the viewer can let their imagination wander. Or if they do bring her back, at least wait until we've all forgotten about her by season 3. We don't need another unlikely nerd finding their courage and beating the bad guys story, and if they bring her back that's the only way I can see it going. Barb returns but she's no longer a dingus and she's ready to kick some upside down booty. I'll pass on that story it's been done a bajillion times, thanks. Barb should not become a recurring character. She's not interesting IMO.",

I think Craven has even written some proper Lovecraftian tales. \n\nCan't wait to find out that the Demogorgon is either a spawn of Yog Sothoth or a manifestation of all of Eleven's repressed pain and anger and therefore an extension of her.

Its all very innocent and adventurous with the occasional dark turn.\n\nThe Teens are dealing with a mysterious force that is killing off their friends and the drama of high school social dynamics. They are the first to encounter the monster, realize that nobody else is going to believe them or help them, and they get to eventually 'kill' it in a final confrontation to save the town. Romance is had and lessons are learned. By itself its a standard teen horror monster movie.\n\nAnd the adults, they encounter the monster ONCE (pretty sure Hopper NEVER sees it in person) and the vast majority of their story comes from the very adult fear of losing a kid and combating the people who are trying to cover up the situation... then stumbling into the larger coverup and things get weird. Most of it is a straight up mystery movie of Hopper tracking down clues and unwinding the conspiracy.\n\nYet all these characters and stories intertwine and react to each other in a seamless fashion, so the whole experience is its own unique work. It'd be very interesting to watch an edit of the show that tries its best to isolate each storyline so that we only see the characters from one particular perspective.",

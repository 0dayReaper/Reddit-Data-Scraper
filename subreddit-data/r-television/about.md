Rules:

No spoilers: * No spoilers in submission titles are allowed. 

* Comments containing spoilers should be spoiler tagged, unless the context indicates otherwise. "Context" means you should expect **untagged** Breaking Bad spoilers in a Breaking Bad thread unless OP specifies or implies otherwise, e.g. the title is "I'm on the first season of Breaking Bad, does it get better?"

* There is no age exception for spoilers, it does not matter how old the book, show, movie etc. is.

No piracy: Requests for or links to streams, torrents, etc. will be removed. Posts that appear to be veiled requests for piracy may also be removed.

No duplicate news/old news: * If multiple links about the same news/article/etc. are submitted, only one submission will be allowed to stay.

* Old news will likely be removed, especially if it has been submitted before and/or does not clarify in the title that the news is old.

* This rule is not enforced for text post threads whose primary purpose is not sharing or discussing a link. An example is multiple threads made by different users submitting their opinion of a newly released show - that is allowed.

No low quality listicles: Articles/videos that are list based, such as "22 facts you didn't know about Game of Thrones!", or "10 shows to watch this summer!" will be removed. Mostly this is to remove low quality content, but some listicles may be allowed to remain if they are of sufficient quality.

No political reporting except for late night shows: See the following link for the full description of this rule: https://www.reddit.com/r/television/wiki/rules#wiki_8._no_political_reporting

No bad/vague/false/misleading/etc. titles: Titles should indicate what a user can expect to see or read in your link and should attempt to remain relatively neutral. Vague and sensationalized titles may cause your submission to be removed. Titles should also be free of spoilers. Titles should not contain the website's name from the link, e.g. "HBO is developing a new show about pirates | E Online". Titles that are sufficiently misleading may also cause the submission to be removed.

No being uncivil to other users: Users who are engaging in personal attacks or are otherwise being overly hostile or rude may have their comments removed and may be banned.

No asking for a recommendation: All requests for recommendations belong in our weekly [recommendation thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/television/search?q=flair%3A%22Weekly+Rec+Thread%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). It is acceptable to create threads to recommend shows to other users, or to post a thread concerning a specific show. "Should I watch Game of Thrones?" is fine as it prompts discussion of a specific show. A thread such as "Can you give me shows like Game of Thrones?" is not allowed. Do not be a "help vampire".

No requests to help remember or find something: Requests for help to remember something should go to r/tipofmytongue. People looking for help to find where to watch something should use justwatch.com or an alternative.

No non-top level sources: Where possible, we prefer that the original source of news be posted, except where prohibited by other rules (e.g. the source is a tweet). Articles that post about an excerpt of an interview made for another publication are also fine.

No gossip: The personal lives of people who work in the entertainment should not be posted about unless it is news that may substantially impact their career or some work (e.g. a debilitating illness).

No off-topic posts: Something airing on television, or something concerning a person who has appeared on television, does not necessarily make it relevant to r/television.

Other rules: This rule set primarily describes rules not enforced automatically through u/AutoModerator. You can view a more detailed list of rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/wiki/rules).

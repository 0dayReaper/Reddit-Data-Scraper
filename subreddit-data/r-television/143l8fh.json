    "postText": "For the past few years I've noticed this with such shows, particularly on Fox. Compared to earlier seasons of a show, the new ones seem to have a weird mood to them. I'm not sure if it's the higher quality of animation or such. The mood being that as if there's a death in the family or something. The way the show sounds with the dialog and the pacing of certain things. It just seems \"quieter\" and slower. Compared to earlier seasons things are more vibrant and energized. Anyone else notice that vibe?",

Also, as somebody already said as the animation gets better it feels like it's getting less dynamic. I wonder if that just come down to cutting budgets and doing the least in terms of animating. \n\nAs for it feeling \"Slower\" is there a chance it really is slower. Could you be comparing the first run of recent episode not to first runs of old episodes but the syndicated versions? It's a long running practice to literally broadcast these shows at a slightly faster rate in syndication to add time for more commercials. Family Guy at the end of it's time on TBS got really bad, when there was a musical number it was almost speed up enough to change the pitch of the voices.",

You can see a change in The Simpsons for example, as the animation quality from the early days no longer exist as the style has gotten more conventional, looking like a typical Family Guy animation.\n\nBut there are examples of modern technology keeping level standards of the hand drawn era, Rick and Morty, Fired on Mars just to name a few from the top of my head. Some shows like Superjail stuck with the old ways and is hand drawn completely. Ultimately, the art direction can deceive or reveal much work went into animating. A show like Samurai Jack looks simple at first glance but thanks to the amazing art direction, they are able to bend rules and create a unique style only possible in Samurai Jack. On the other hand, you can tell a show like Archer don\u2019t spend much time focused on animation, which could explain why they were able to churn out so much episodes. Same can be said for The Simpsons.",

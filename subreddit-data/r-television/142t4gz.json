Since then, I've had a lifelong love of reading.\n\nReading Rainbow, Sesame Street, [and now a little-known show called Zoobilee Zoo, all ring strong in my mind when I think of things that helped inspire me to learn and to discover new things, when I was a young child.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oowOsEOTApA)\n\nReading is a skill that we've mastered as a species that is truly remarkable.

As time passed on, the excitement of being able to understand what he was saying was such an amazing feeling. He opened up not only the ability to read but to dream and be a good person. \n\nI\u2019m in my early 40\u2019s now and my kid just turned 1 and one of the most meaningful things I\u2019m excited about is re-watching reading rainbow with her. \n\nLevar, if you ever see this, thank you.",

But no, his only notable movie after Girl Next Door was the Die Hard sequel that came our 3 years later. lol I'm sorry, but he was never a movie star. He just got roles in movies every now and then.\n\nDeadwood is a TV show that made Olyphant famous before Justified lol not The Girl Next Door movie.\n\nI'd argue that when Girl Next Door came out, most people still thought he was Josh Dumal and thinking he was in Transformers thar year too.\n\nI love Olyphant, but he has never been a recognizable movie star. He has always been a recognizable Tv star who appears in some movies every now and then.\n\nNo one looks at Olyphant and thinks, \"Good thing he had The Girl Next Door, or else he would have never been famous\"",

Someone else suggested Timothy Olyphant, and you decided to chime in and claim he was a movie star. You didn't say hybrid actor. You tried to claim he was more well known for Scream 2 or Girl Next Door than anything else. And I found that comical.\n\n&gt;2 of his most notable roles are from Scream 2 and The Girl Next Door. \n\nYou're not saying specifically movies, and you never mentioned him being a \"hybrid actor.\" lol you're literally saying his most well-known roles are 2 movies from 20 years ago. Not counting the 3 or 4 starring roles he has had across several successful television shows.\n\nYou're the one who tried to question how Olyphant doesn't work for OP's question, but you're not actually giving good reasons. Just because he did movies first doesn't make him more well known than his later Tv roles.\n\nLol jeez what a silly hill to die on. \"Timothy Olyphant is a more well-known movie star! I mean, he's a hybrid actor!\" \n\nDo you even know what your point is anymore?",

Most of the failure I see at high profile productions is that there isn't enough preproduction, or something doesn't work on set or the script used on set isn't strong enough to let the actor shine. It's not that the cast is bad, shooting at that level and price point is obscenely difficult because everyone wants a hand on the tiller.",

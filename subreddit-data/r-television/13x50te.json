The fact that the episode was advertised as 'season finale' and not 'series finale' is extremely telling.",

I found some of the storylines so painfully amateur and the reliance on real world events felt cheap (the \"shut up and dribble\" tweet and the nude photo leak) and uncreative. Certainly, it felt like they were chasing too many characters around without really knowing what to do with them.\n\nI know there are a few people who think the charm has worn off and people are starting to see that *Ted Lasso* was never good, but I disagree. There's a stark quality difference this season, from the writing to the lighting. They can do better.",

Everything with Roy and Jamie was great, the Collin and Sam subplots were real good and the stuff between Danni and Zorro (aka Van Damme, Zoreaux) was hilarious. Rupert was too cartoonish and Rebecca\u2019s stuff just seemed like filler to keep her character occupied and wrap her story up. \n\n\nIt feels like Brett and Bill went off to do Shrinking (which is fantastic) and Jason was over the project, so this didn\u2019t get their full attention and was left to the other writers to workout. Bill probably laid out the overarching plot and some specifics. Then had the other writers connect the dots. The plots for Ted Keeley, Rebecca and Nate are solid, it\u2019s just poor execution connecting the dots. \n\n\nWhat I loved about the earlier episodes was Teds endless positivity. It just got depressing when it used to be so uplifting. That\u2019s fine if it\u2019s done well, but this didn\u2019t seem like their best effort.",

It's time to take a breath, see what might work, but Apple obviously wants to.  \n\nPS: Perhaps all this has already been defined, but I think that one of the rules of the WGA strike is not to negotiate new shows and renewals with the studios (or at least not to announce them).",

They closed so many loops leaving only continuations that are not supposed to be made, the happily ever after type endings where the implication is the story continues but it's left to the imagination. Most shows typically don't do that as they leave unresolved questions to allow for enough space to make something out of the 'end', For example SPOILER::: \n\n\nJessie screaming and driving away in breaking bad\n\nThere is no room to make anything out of the Ted Lasso finale and that's the way it should be.",

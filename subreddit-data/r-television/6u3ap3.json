It will now cost $13.99 monthly.'\n\nArticle [here](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-canada-prices-1.4241556)\n\nEdit 2:  Since apparently no one will read the [article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and people keep asking me, this is for ***Canadian customers only*** and therefore these prices are in Canadian dollars.

I think people make the mistake of saying \"Disney is leaving, they're doomed!\" while we fail to recognize that Netflix is becoming a Disney unto themselves. \n\nThey have so many quality original IP's, that they're becoming their own network, in the same vein as HBO - but a thousand times bigger *and* with the ability to accurately predict exactly what their demographics and viewers may want. Even better - I think they've got a good idea of what to do to attract NEW viewers to their service. \n\nThey're extremely aggressive in a new market, whereas Disney is not. ",

The potential is there for a television phenomenon, as I think the Witcher universe is something that many people can fall in love with, as they did for Middle-Earth or Westeros. But as others have said, it'll all be down to the casting and making sure that the writing is solid. Hopefully they're consulting the original author and CDProjectRed for direction, as that will be really important to capturing the feeling of the world.",

But the writing itself is confusing and spastic. And a bit all over the place. CDPR did a much better job of telling a coherent story than the books did.  (At least with W3, I haven't played the others.) \n\nEdit: It appears most people are saying this is the fault of the English translation.",

She would probably be one of the most important castings, assuming they don't just choose one actress (which would be pretty risky).\n\nBut for right now, assuming it's just short stories for the first season or so, Ciri's actress isn't that prominent.",

The pace can be a little jarring at first but it's actually pretty refreshing if you're used to shows that tend to linger for the sake of it. For example, at one point a character informs another that someone is plotting against him, but the show didn't hold our hand with a scene of the baddie monologueing with a dramatic close up of the goodie's surprised face--it just lets us assume time has passed, he's a smart guy, he figured it out, it's fine. And it is, it works.\n\nAnd if you're not familiar with the actual content: It's often compared to *GoT* but is set in historical late 800s England, as the Great Heathen Army of vikings invades Britain with the intent to stay, not just raid this time. The main character is fictional and has a habit of being in all the right places at the right time (which the show even cheekily nods to at one point). The central historical figure is King Alfred of Wessex as he holds out against the Danes and invents the idea of a united England after the rest of the Saxon kingdoms fall. The actor who plays him is quite good, and I also really enjoyed the actors for the viking warlords.\n\nEDIT: Above I only described the big picture, which I'm realizing may make the story seem a little dry. On the personal level of the main character it's about a clash between Saxon/Christian and Danish/pagan identity, and the conflict between the scores he needs to settle and the oaths he swears along the way. Blood vs. upbringing, pride vs. honor. Good stuff.",

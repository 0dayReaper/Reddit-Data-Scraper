There's this niche online community that went wild and loud for it, but really no one else. It never even gained much general audience appeal and for people who work in media it was never a thing, especially because the first few seasons were very middling, industry people just never cared. Of course journalists and writers know they can get clicks, but that doesn't change that people aren't really interested. I liked the show, but its way blown out of proportion by fan boys\n\nScores are fake. I'd say that for any show, not just this one.",

In which case, I'd expect Strong to take it as he's taken it before, despite Culkin deserving it more this season, IMO.\n\nI expect best supporting actress to go to Jennifer Coolidge again, though if The White Lotus is going to win that I'd much rather it go to Meghann Fahy. I expect J. Smith Cameron to still be nominated here but I'm not convinced she'll be able to win it with her (incredibly frustrating) limited screentime this season.",

Bob was great in season 6, but if he didn't win for season 1, 4, or 5 then you're right that it is unlikely for season 6. \n\nMeanwhile Rhea IMO blew her other amazing performances out of the water in season 6. Her work in episode 8, 9, and 12 were phenomenal. Her subtle performance of her character sinking into darker depths was amazing as well. Same mannerisms and demeanor but *just* off enough to make her make my stomach churn.",

I think the culmination of &gt;!the Sandpiper case being settled via the prank and the payoff of Lalo killing Howard!&lt; after all that build-up earned it the right to say it was the best written episode among the nominees of last season.\n\nAll the bells say was a good episode of Succession but it's juggling a whole lot less than Plan and Execution so defs the lesser episode for me.\n\nSeason 6B of Better Call Saul peaked at Fun &amp; Games imo. The &gt;!intro of Walt and Jesse are fun but after the first time it's not all that memorable and the resolution of the Gene storyline while also fun to see is not nearly as compelling as the Jimmy to Saul arc!&lt; It's a shame because BCS is without a doubt on the same tier of Breaking Bad and doesn't have the Emmys to show for it.",

If he's considered guest rather than supporting, then I think he earned it more than Offerman.\n\nPlus Andor deserves at least one win. I expect noms for most of the major categories, but let's be real, it's not beating out Succession or BCS for the bigger awards (even if I prefer Andor).",

Reddit treats the show like it's the second coming of the kino christ. It's a great series but it's not that IMO.",

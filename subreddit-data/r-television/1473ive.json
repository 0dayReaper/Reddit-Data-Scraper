    "postText": "The Arrowverse shows come to mind. All of them seemed to be quite good for the first few years then the quality nose dived. Sherlock saw something similar. Seasons 1-3 were great Season 4 was fairly bad. More recently we've seen it happen with The Good Doctor and The Morning show. Why does this happen? Do the writers lose steam? Do the actors get bored? Is it a combination of things?",

            "comment": "Hard disagree about Sherlock. Sherlock was good for 1 episode.  It's a very well shot, high budget show, which falsely leads people to believe it's good. If you take a closer look at the writing, it's a lot of nonsense and unnecessary fluff. The writers have a fundamental misunderstanding of why people enjoy mystery stories. It's not so the story can purposely hide information and then berate the audience for trying to figure out the mystery.\n\nTo answer your question though. Walking Dead fits the bill. Good for 1 season. Most of the times, shows fall off due to greed from the studios. They want to cut costs and milk the cash cow even though the story should have concluded already.",

The most common one is simply the writers run out of ideas or the cast get bored, they've told the story they wanted to tell, but because its popular and profitable the studio continues to renew it for more seasons.\n\nSo they either stick around with their hearts not in it, or they leave and their is a chance whoever replaces them either doesn't have the same spark, or doesn't understand the series.\n\nPeople often forget that whilst its enjoyable for us, for the people making it, this is still a job.\n\nAnother reason can simply be that some shows only have a short shelf life. Even if everyone involved loves it and want to carry on, the reality is the story has already been told. Carrying on is just an unnecessary epilogue.",

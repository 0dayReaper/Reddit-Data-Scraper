From a guy who could never decide on anything, to being absolutely sure with what he wants towards the end of his story.",

He flew to France to secretly get Lily back together with Marshall, with zero credit. He (although misconceived) routinely tried to help Ted and follow the Bro code. He was never a bad guy via malice; he was, at worst, misguided due to his personal painful history (abandonment by his father, and then betrayal by Shannon.

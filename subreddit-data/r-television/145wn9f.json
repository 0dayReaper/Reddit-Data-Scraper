    "postText": "I was watching a clip of TBBT, but I've noticed it with clips of Better Call Saul and others too... Why do tv shows look like they've been visually remastered to be brighter and more 'realistic'? Like it looks like raw footage shot on a digital camera (which of course, it was)? Doesn't it sort of take the viewer out of it, or am I just old? I swear it feels like I'm watching a theater performance shot on a cellphone camera. Is that the intent? Am I imagining things?",

Many televisions have out of the box settings that make movies and shows look terrible.\n\nMotion smoothing is a big problem.\n\nSome televisions have 'dynamic' as a default setting, sometimes it's called vivid picture mode.\n\nIt's not great for movie watching. A lot of televisions are calibrated for sports, so it might take some time and experimenting to get a more neutral image.",

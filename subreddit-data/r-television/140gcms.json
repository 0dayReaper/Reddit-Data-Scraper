For example I just watched [her Taxi episode](https://youtu.be/1rmYS8raXYY) again recently. I know her voice has always been raspy but if you don\u2019t think it sounds [substantially different now](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lx9whb/marge_simpson_voice_comparison_1987_to_2020/) then idk what to tell you. She doesn\u2019t sound well at all, and I\u2019m not the first person to notice it. All of the voice actors on The Simpsons have aged noticeably but Julie Kavner is the only one who sounds like she\u2019s dying in the recording booth. Sorry for having an opinion some people don\u2019t like..?? Idk why people are getting so upset that I\u2019m saying this. Watch some recent episodes and hear for yourself. Whether it\u2019s just the natural sound of her aging voice or some injury she suffered over the years, either way, I really think she sounds awful now.",

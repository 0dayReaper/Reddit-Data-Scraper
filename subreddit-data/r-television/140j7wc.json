Not in a nasty way, they just moved on' and it was such a realistic ending to it. \n\nI think we all made this exact promise at various times in our life like the end of university and it was more bittersweet than most shows for me because that's what happens in real life. Of course Bree, Gabby, Susan and Lynette weren't going to stay friends forever, they were friends because they lived on Wisteria Lane and when that ended so did their friendship.",

When the people start openly mocking the dictater with zero repercussions, it opens the flood gates for revolution. There's obviously a massive number of steps between a meme and real change, but that government is perched at the top of a very slippery slope and one wrong step could send them sliding down.\n\nThere are literally billions of people, if they want to revolt they have the man power. The only thing stopping them is the fear and mental/behavioral conditioning by the government. It starts with making fun of the dictater for looking like pooh bear, but that leads to discussion about the shitty things the leader does, or to other memes against him and it gets peoples minds working in a way that they have been locked out from their whole lives, and step by step the government begins to lose power over peoples minds until it reaches a point that real change can be enacted.\n\n#memes can save the world",

Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way. But the only thing that can fuck an asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with dicks is that sometimes they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate \u2014 and it takes a pussy to show them that. But sometimes, pussies get so full of shit that they become assholes themselves... because pussies are only an inch and a half away from assholes. I don't know much in this crazy, crazy world, but I do know that if you don't let us fuck this asshole, we're going to have our dicks and pussies all covered in shit!",

Not only did this get banned, but right after this came out we had the NBA, ESPN, Apple, AND The Blizzard story breakout about how China is in their pockets. Couldn\u2019t have made a more significant episode if you tried... and the most amazing thing is how they put this episode together in 6 days.",

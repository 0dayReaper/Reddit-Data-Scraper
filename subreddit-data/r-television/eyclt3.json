At [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Michelob-Ultra-Pure-Gold-Organic-Light-Lager-6-Pack-Beer-12-FL-OZ-Bottles/418652921) a six pack of this beer runs $8.98.\n\nSo if we generously purchase 50,000,000 six packs of beer from them, that will run us a cool $449,000,000 dollars.  And they'll donate 2 cents from each six pack.  $0.02 x 50,000,000 = $1,000,000.\n\nSince a Super Bowl ad costs $5 million per 30 seconds this year.  Michelob spent $10 million to tell us this.  \n\nHail Corporate Overlords for their incredible generosity.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEdit:   Well, this blew up. Thanks to everyone for the gold and awards.  Much appreciated.\n\nSince I have a little platform, I want to respond to the top \u201ccriticism\u201d I\u2019m seeing, which goes something like this:  \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to give anything, at least they are helping rather than doing nothing, of course they are here to sell beer. . . etc.\u201d  \n\nThis is all true.  But the reason I posted this, and the reason I think it has made it to r/all, is because of the nature of the ad.   This advertisement is a solid 1 minute of sanctimonious garbage about how buying this beer is going to save the planet. The. Whole. Ad.  Michelob is trying to get you in the feels.  That Michelob is doing the right thing, that they are moral and that they are generous.  And that you can be moral and generous too.  If only you would buy their beer.  Again, 60 solid seconds of this.\n\nThen you read the fine print.  And then you do the math.  It\u2019s one-third of a penny per bottle to charity.  \n\nSo to give less than two-tenths of a percent of sales is just a joke, particularly in light of the heavy-handed message, and in light of the fact that they dropped $10+ million on the stupid ad, and probably another $10-30 million more on a national marketing campaign. And on top of that ***they capped the donation*** to a million dollars. So even if the beer is a huge hit, and even we buy $1 billion dollars worth of it, they're still just going to give a million bucks. Well, that's just cheap-ass corporate BS.  It's all foam and no beer.\n\nIf it were a \"normal\" ad for an organic lite beer, telling us how great the beer tasted, how it was grown from sustainable ingredients, and that we'd all get laid, and then in the last 5-10 seconds, they mentioned they were giving a portion of all sales to help farmers go organic, I'd have no issues.\n\nSo this post is about full-disclosure.  About being transparent and honest about what a huge mega-corporation is doing.  I know they are a corporation and their goal is to make money.  I\u2019m cool with that.  But don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re \u201csaving the world\u201d because you left a penny in the \u201ctake-a-penny, leave-a-penny\u201d cup on the counter.  \n\n***\u201cAt Michelob, we're proud to announce that for every bottle you buy, we'll donate one-third of one penny to help farmers go organic.  Unless the beer is really, really popular, and then we'll give less.\"***",

There is way too much risk between bad PR, news coverage of Internet trends and becoming the next \"sense of pride and accomplishment\".

Women\n\nAt the time Betty Ford publicly spoke about her breast cancer as first lady, she received huge condemnations and huge accolades for bringing up the subject in the 1970s. This was also a time when various states were still forcibly sterilizing Native American women and women prisoners- often without even telling them. Women could still be fired for being pregnant.\n\n(I'm focusing on women's campaigns primarily to show problems in the medical world that women faced, but they weren't alone in that)\n\nAwareness campaigns were designed whether they were for women,  HIV/STD patients, cancers, etc. as a way to broach the subject publicly and push hard for more public information. \n\nIn some ways, we've moved beyond that as social stigmas and laws have moved beyond (mostly) from punishing people for being sick or not knowing something.\n\nBut yeah. Susan G is a scam. Pink \"awareness\" types scams are common, but that doesn't mean they're all that way.",

                            "comment": "I am a beer rep who spent years working in multiple large chain grocery stores. So in my region, a case (24-pack of domestic bottles) costs \u201cBig Box Store\u201d $17.75 and they will sell that case retail at $17.98 making $.23 a case. \u201cBig Box Store\u201d wants to sell cheap cases of beer because their metrics show that per cart, people buying a case of beer spend 40-45% more than people not buying beer. 23 cents seems like a low profit margin. But when \u201cBig Box Store\u201d brings in 6-packs of the same domestic, that cases costs $20.20 (or $5.05/6-pack) but they generally charge $6.49-$7.49 per six pack for a profit of $1.44-$2.44/6-pack (or $8.64-$9.84/case). Basically if you don\u2019t want to buy in quantity, you are going to pay for it. So, although the math the OP used in this example is correct, it is not near as extreme of a margin.  \n  \nAlso, ANHEISER BUSCH WILL SELL THIS MUCH ULTRA REGARDLESS OF THIS PROGRAM.  \n  \nThis is why they have a cap, they are going to donate this money no matter what. Do you know why? Out of the goodness of there hearts? No, it is a tax write off, but hey, if you have to give the money away you may as well look good doing it. And do you know why they are targeting farmers? Because they pissed off the entire Midwest last Super Bowl by preaching how Bud Light was made without corn syrup. \n\nAlso to answer your question AB has tiers of beer that fit pricing models. Value Brand (natural, Busch), Core Brand (Bud, Bud Light), Core + (Mich Ultra, BL Platinum, St Pauli), Premium (Ultra Pure Gold, Kirin, Bass), Super Premium (Stella, Goose Island, Elysian), Beyond Beer (Rita\u2019s, BL Seltzer, BL Chelada) and finally Non-alcoholics (odouls, teavana, Icelandic water) to name a few brands. So no, michelob ultra is not targeting cheap enough beers to maintain your alcoholism (see king cobra) but rather they are targeting \u201cweekend warriors\u201d. \n\nOn average ultra cost the stores $1-$2 more a case than Bud or bud light.  \n  \nAlso I know I am nitpicking but AB more than likely did not pay full value for all of the SB commercials. I believe they are worked into the deal as \u201cofficial beer sponsors of the nfl\u201d which cost $1.4 billion for 2015-2022. But don\u2019t get me wrong, they still payed a ton.  \n  \nI feel like I\u2019m jumping around, but on the other hand OPs numbers on how much consumers have to buy to get this donation might also be low as the standard markup for every liquor store I\u2019ve ever worked with is 60%. Whatever the store pays they figure up 60% and then generally roll it up to the nearest $0.09. \n\nSorry to make this so long and scatterbrained but as a guy who makes a living peddling this stuff, every year AB makes an ad about some sort of charitable contribution they are making and every year a post gets to the front page about how terrible they are for making the ad. And for the most part I tend to agree with OP, but at the end of the day you are really just crying because \u201cbig business could give more\u201d well I have news for you, that\u2019s not how big business works. Do you think the nfl really cared about breast cancer awareness every October for ten years? (Ok they probably did a little) At the end of the day, that whole program was to increase female viewership (which worked). Am I mad that the nfl donated a ton of resources for cancer? Absolutely not, but you are kidding yourself if you think they did it altruistically. Any Fortune 500 company that donates money to any cause is just doing it for PR and tax write offs. It is just silly to raise pitchforks every year because AB does it on the biggest stage. No one is mad that AB is [fighting climate change with rice](https://www.indigoag.com/pages/news/indigo-partners-with-anheuser-busch-for-sustainable-rice) or how Stella partnered with water.org to [provide fresh water sources for 3.5 million people in developing countries](https://www.ab-inbev.com/news-media/water-stewardship/stellas-buy-a-lady-a-drink-program.html) in just three years, or the tons of other programs constantly going on that most people don\u2019t know about because they don\u2019t advertise it. My point is that all of this has its negative and positive aspects and unless you want to destroy capitalism which validates a $10 million commercial in the first place, please calm yourselves. \n\nTl|Dr: I just spent an hour typing a rant about beer costs and advertisements that at this point 7 people will read, oh yeah, ultra isn\u2019t for alcoholics, that is what 40\u2019s of Hurricane High Gravity are for.\n\nEdit: after 9 years of redditing, this comment just earned me my first gold (I remember before gold was a thing) and my first award of any kind! I always wondered what I would do if this honor was ever bestowed upon me. I am not going to say that you should donate to a more worthy cause because you will never know how proud I am in this moment, but if you need that I will recommend donating to the campaign of Bernie Sanders, he is once again asking for our financial support.\n\n2nd edit: removed the name of the big box store for fear of retaliation concerning my livelihood lol\n\nEdit 3: nitpicking not knot-picking, thanks u/249ba36000029bbe9749",

There's going to be corporate level tiers that kick in which rebate different amounts for different performance levels.  And it might even be captured under totally different cost centers.  So they might end getting $3,000,000 of \"program support\" for honoring a certain teir of monthly commitment and keeping returns and wastage below some threshold.  \n\nYou and I might notice that level corresponds to the equivalent of 3 million six packs, so we might say they're only paying $14.75/case.  But the CFO and general counsel would strenuously say not to connect those dots.  They'd say it's \"program support\" or \"preferred vendor synergistic collaborative platform loyalty brand building\", or tie it to some other euphemism for reasons that usually end up being regulatory or tax reducing.  \n\nNow, about how these \"we donate X for every sale of Y\" programs.  They're all budgeted and minutely calculated ahead of time.  They know with excellent precision what will sell in a given period, so they overlay the desired maximum \"donation\" over the sales and work it backwards to decided how much $ per widget-time-unit.  The maximum cost is put on the books and budget gets allocated.  Then to make it a nice round and good sounding number, they just tinker the time period, which most people don't think about and is buried in fine print.\n\nIf they want to donate $10 million and projected sales are 3 million units a month, it sounds better to say they're giving $1/unit (for 3 months) than to say 25 cents a unit (for a year).",

The drop in inventiveness and quality in their flagship beer, Bourbon County (and it's varietal flavors), has been marked. For beer lovers, the release of Bourbon Co. was an event. It happens on black friday and people wait in line for 24+ hours at some locations to guarantee they'll get all the limited production varietals, all of which generally sell out that day. This year I didn't wait in line or even really make any extra effort to look for it.  Don't mistake me, it's still pretty good but no longer the benchmark of bourbon barrel beers like it used to be. Makes me sad. It was a special thing I'd look forward to and it's been taken by a big fucking corporation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: i've been informed that AB purchased goose island in 2011. my mistake. so why the distinct drop in quality so many years after? i can't be sure of course but an educated guess would point me in the direction of two things: 1) implementation of flash pasteurizing after the mass infection of bcbs by lactobacillus several years ago and 2) a suspicious correlation in the massive ramp up in production that made quality harder to control and *may* have involved cost cutting measures (as often happens). this is speculation on my part. what i do know is that bcbs seems to have lost some of its artistry. the varietals this year were pedestrian and even mediocre. the proprietor was the worst i've tasted, any interesting notes swallowed by overwhelming spiciness. dunno. maybe i've just gotten more snobby!",

So the sale actually let to more inventiveness.  Before they were sold, and even after for a couple years, BCBS was unceremoniously released.  It wasn't until ab took over that they made it a black Friday thing.\n\nI personally haven't noticed the drop in quality that people talk about.  It May no longer be the benchmark of barrel aged beer... But that's because they were the only ones doing it.  Now I can walk into any grocery store and find some barrel aged beer.  The 5 breweries within 10 minutes of me all have barrel aged beer.  Hell, the brewery a couple towns over (hailstorm) is doing barrel aged beers that blow BCBS out if the water... Not because BCBS is bad, rather hailstorm is making such incredible beer.",

Fuck you Walmart, you ruined small towns all over the US. And fuck all these companies using people in trouble, and promises of bullshit donations, to sell more product. It's not charity if it isn't altruistic and rather it's a sort of blackmail \"buy our shit or the farmers starve\"",

And you\u2019re here whining on Reddit about a company donating to a cause. If they openly talk about donating, then it could cause other people to donate as well. And there is nothing bad about that.\n\nThis is literally Reddit every single time, until someone like the person making this post works out the numbers. Don't brag about donations when your percentage of a percentage that will actually go to a cause and not to a circlejerk publicity fest. Donate more instead, or donate quietly without trying to make a marketing soundbyte off of it.",

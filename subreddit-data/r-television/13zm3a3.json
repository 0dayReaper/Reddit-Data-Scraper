            "comment": "I've noticed this. I think it's a pacing thing. For whatever reason, animation can compress time in a way that feels natural, where if life action tried to be that fast it would feel rushed. To put it another way, quickly cut animation feels like efficient storytelling, quickly cute live action feels like an editing choice",

            "comment": "This is purely \"educated guessing\" but I would also imagine the nature of filming between the works allows animation (TV) to allow more \"scenes\" per episode than live-action (TV) so live-action shows can often end up having slower pacing.\n\nI.E I have noticed in more \"mid-range\" live action shows there is often more \"transition\" shots or even full-on scenes to help pad out the episodes run time or space potentially expensive action shots.",

The other tries to focus on the whole cast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn animation can be set where ever. They can have the character do whatever. \n\nYou don't even need to worry about the actor availability. The VO can knock out a season worth of episodes in a day or two. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut in the end it's always writing. You can write a tv series or movie about the Flash. Or you can write a tv series about non Flash related characters and occasionally involve the title character. While the network also demands you get enough T&amp;A for reasons.",

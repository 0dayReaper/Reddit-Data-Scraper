I get its a murder of the week but some episodes felt repetitive.\n\nAnd it has the old Murder She Wrote issue where stretching credulity because \"Why is someone dying every place the person shows up\". It can take me out of it a little.\n\nSome of the people involved in the cases (not the murderers) are hard to care about. \n\nThe pacing is a little slow. Some episodes overstay their welcome. \n\nI'm probably being harsh because there was a tidal wave of hype and most of time things can never live up to it. \n\nBut anyone else watch it and not feel it?",

So it's more like, there are always murders happening everywhere, to one degree or another, but this girl is one of the few people who can almost always notice/solve it.",

Every show has this level of ridiculousness baked into it and we just overlook it, because stories aren\u2019t reality, and some unrealistic things need to happen to make the stories happen.",

Some episodes overstay their welcome.\n\nI quite agree. What I think puts me off the most is that it is *intelligently* constructed but it's delivery is just, well, I guess \"plodding\" is a good word.\n\nI see posts about it and think \"I guess I should try to ... oh, wait, I could watch *Hopscotch* again!\" or some other movie/series.\n\n*Poker Face* did not grip me; it, in fact, left me utterly ungripped in all my grippable places.",

It's like watching Mrs. Davis and saying \"that's not what reality is like!\" Now you might not like that and that's fine, but Poker Face was exactly what its creators designed it to be. It was funny where it was supposed to be funny, it gave a sly wink to the audience where it was supposed to and I personally, I'm glad it's coming back for a second season.",

Maybe the genre is just exactly for me, where I don\u2019t mind the slower and repetitive structure, and it definitely isn\u2019t perfect. But it\u2019s so delightfully fun and smartly plotted that it kept me engaged the whole time.",

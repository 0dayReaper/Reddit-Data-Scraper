I might be willing to play around with it if it's around the price of a current gen console, but who is going to pay 6 times that price for a VR headset?\n\nI know, I know, don't count out Apple when they introduce new tech.  But I don't know if even die-hard Apple people are ready to drop that much for some new tech that hasn't been able to generate much buzz when anyone else tried it for much, much lower costs.\n\nI'll also be curious to see what battery life is like and what it can do without being tethered to a different device to generate what you see.",

It seems like the target audience for this particular model is devs and particular workflows/users to replace (or augment) their laptop. However as of right now it is using external hot-swappable battery packs with \\~2 hours per pack or can be directly powered, but doesn't need a host device to run it.\n\nIf you are looking at this as a sheer \"entertainment\" device, then yeah this is not likely the product for you. However, for Disney and others the larger part is for the inevitable next versions that are cheaper to produce. The specs for the headset part of this thing is absolutely top-shelf in every degree and will likely be some of the first things to tune down to have the more \"basic\" models down the line for the fraction of the cost.",

I can't think of any devs that would want to work with this for any lengthy period of time.  I always laugh at sci-fi shows and movies that have people doing their normal work on floating hologram screens.  Having to hold your hands up with nothing to rest them on all day is tiring and not user friendly.  It's fun for short bursts, like playing games, but I can't imagine how tiring it would be to use this for actual work for any extended period of time.",

At least it's sold like that.",

    "postText": "Even season 1 wasn't good. The first season had a couple good characters like Noah and maybe Hiro but it was overstuffed with characters that they never bothered to flesh out. The main trio (Hiro, Peter, Sylar) were ridiculously overpowered which caused the writing to be fairly contrived and the characters very moronic in order to make the plot work. The finale was an incredibly anticlimactic and underwhelming wet fart that made all the buildup utterly worthless. And don't get me started on all the flashbacks and the silly backstories where everyone's mum and dad is involved in a shadowy plot and everyone's a secret supermutant. And then it's even explained how the solar eclipse was what gave everyone their powers which doesn't make any sense for numerous reasons lol. People keep blaming the \"strike\" for the show falling off a cliff in later seasons, but the cracks were already there in the first season. The best episode was probably Company Man written by Bryan Fuller, and it just so happened to focus on Noah (the only good character in the show). The show wasn't helped by its soporific tone, lack of character depth, bland performances, and pretentious dialogue.\r  \n\r  \nI think as far as superhero shows are concerned, Daredevil and The Boys were far better.",

Unfair to compare it to shows nowadays when they are all derivatives of Heroes and films like the X-Men that shaped the modern superhero genre. You also had to live through the era during the original run of Heroes to fully understand the buzz. This show was huge back in the day. I seriously doubt OP was old enough to watch TV back when Heroes aired, and even if they were to claim otherwise, they probably didn\u2019t own a TV set because they would know this was what everyone saw, obsessively spoke about.",

It's always kind of adorable when the kids pop in to say \"I didn't like Twin Peaks. It sucks. X-Files was the better show about an FBI agent exploring the supernatural\".  Like Twin Peaks didn't walk so X-Files could run.\n\nI mean Heroes premiered 6 years before the first season of Arrow set off the CW superhero universe.  And 2 years before Iron Man set off the MCU.\n\nAlso, it needs to be said, just because something is M rated and has blood and guts and characters say \"fuck\" doesn't necessarily mean it's better than something that doesn't have that.",

Does that mean The Dark Knight can't be compared to The Batman because they came out nearly 15 years apart?  Or that The Thing can't be compared to the other film that came out in 2011, nearly 30 years after the Carpenter one?  Or how much better Alien is compared to Alien: Covenant.  \n\n\nRome came out nearly 20 years ago yet after inflation it still cost more than House of the Dragon and still puts any other historical epic drama to shame.",

You can do it, but it's fundamentally meaningless and basically entirely useless as a discussion. No one cares if Hamlet is somehow better than Our Town. They were written at different times, in different styles, to address issues important to their given era. This is really basic stuff. How do you expect to be taken seriously as a critic if you don't know anything about how the field functions or why?",

Bryan Fuller's episodes tended to be a cut above the rest, but in general the writing was pretty mediocre. From what I remember, it only got worse after the first season (though I think Fuller still had a couple of good episodes in there).\n\nI think at the time a lot of people gave it a pass because superhero shows weren't very common back then, especially as a big tentpole show on a major network, so it did feel kind of cool to have something like that on TV even if it wasn't a great show in the grand scheme of things.",

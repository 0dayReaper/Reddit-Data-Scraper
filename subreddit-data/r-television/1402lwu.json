It should be large Kung Pao Beef and Orange Chicken, also make sure they put right amount of fortune cookies in the bag, last time they skimmed me. Tomorrow, I want you to pick up my suit from the dry cleaners and on your way go to Dunkin Donuts and pick up my usual, you know just how I like it. After that I want you to go watch some more season 2 episodes and text me when you\u2019re feeling lost again, and I\u2019ll tell you exactly what to do next.",

    "postText": "Ever since Television debuted in the 50\u2019s certain hallmarks have always remained, the Soap Opera, the News, the Sitcom, Sports, and the Game Show. \n\nThe Soap Opera is vaguely surviving but likely will eventually die without many pushback\n\nthe News remains dominant as ever, while evolving to the internet and many other forms\n\nthe Sitcom remains dominant on TV and streaming\n\nSports is obviously massive and the reason most have cable as they refuse to adapt \n\nthen lastly the Game Show remains popular on TV with shows like Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, Family Feud, and Price is Right still going strong as ever, however (besides Family Feuds success on Youtube compilations) these shows haven\u2019t attempted to evolve to streaming. Obviously like Soaps the daily format of these shows is heavily dependent on advertising and that could be a problem on a service, but I don\u2019t see why even a weekly format couldn\u2019t work online. Maybe I am bias as a longtime fan of the format but I would really hate to see the game show just die.\n\nWhat does everyone think? \n\nWill these shows survive on a service or are they so tied to the syndicated nature of TV it couldn\u2019t work?\n\n**and most importantly fuck u/spez i hope this site dies in the next month**",

And maybe Soap Operas are dying in America but Korean soap operas are more popular than ever. I think the classic network daily soap operas and game shows might be fading in popularity along with network television, but like most things, it's probably more of an evolution in how people get their TV than anything else.",

They're not really game shows. I'm not complaining, I love it, but it's not like Price is Right or Wheel of Fortune.",

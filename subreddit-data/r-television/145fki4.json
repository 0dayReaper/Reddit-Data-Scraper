Cena I feel like didn't want to get typecast in \"meathead\" roles, and went for ones that have a little more nuance. Worth noting that when his agent first told him about the Suicide Squad, he was immediately onboard when he heard James Gunn was involved. His agent didn't even finish the sentence when Cena agreed. Maybe he just likes flexing his acting muscles (since he's already flexed all his other ones).",

In the most recent season, he was going down memory lane about his breaking out as a major star in WWE and him hosting SNL.  He was already pushing 30 when he was doing these things, it was very odd seeing another person play his part.  \n\nI am still a fan of his; I'm just hoping this and Black Adam under performing at the B.O. can bring him back down to Earth a bit.  I think he has a lot of natural talent but he's been sleepwalking the past decade or so.",

They have like 4 comedy shows but they are on like 3 different nights through out the week.\nMaybe pick one night, grab 4 shows, and do a 2 hour comedy block. I know it might sound crazy, but it might just work. I don't know why I'm giving away this gold for free.\nThis is what happens when you take a show about 20 somethings drinking and put in on Friday night when your target demo is out drinking.",

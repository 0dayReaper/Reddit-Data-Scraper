They would ask him, \"You're still alive??\"\n\nThat attitude gives you a boost of strength in the lowest times.",

Not helped at all by the office I work in getting sun from rise to set, with no airflow, so if it\u2019s 25 outside it\u2019s 32 in the office. \n\nAnd then the really really cold winters in Edmonton too; here on a cold day I put on a ski jacket, or something thinner over a sweater, and I\u2019m good. My uncle was in Edmonton not long ago and he was wearing a ski jacket over a thinner jacket over a sweater and while comfortable still on the chilly side. I would be miserable. Not that how much rain we get is exactly pleasant, but at least it\u2019s warm enough to usually be liquid. \n\nOf course the coast, mountains, and relative lack of biting insects are also points I like Vancouver for. But I was also lucky enough to be born out here and get a decent little one bedroom for myself in Surrey despite the real estate prices though, so I\u2019m fully aware it\u2019s not as simple for most people as \u201cjust move to far more expensive region hundreds or thousands of km away from everything you know\u201d or anything like that. \n\nAnd I do enjoy visiting other parts of the country, even if my budget and schedule means anything further than Calgary/the Island or maybe a weekend at Whistler or something is largely out of the question. Just wouldn\u2019t much care to live anywhere else without leaving Canada altogether.",

I really don't think he was told until he was near death how much his treatment was targeting a brief extension of life, not \"curing\" or \"beating\" anything.\n\nMaybe Alex Trebek will be one of the exceptionally few people who beats the nigh-insurmountable odds, and obviously I'm rooting for him in the way I'd root for anyone, but the language he's using to describe it makes me uncomfortable.  I feel like he's propagating the idea that if you fight it hard enough you can totally win and that's just what it takes, as if many millions of cancer victims weren't people who fought and clung to life every second to the end with a dedicated care team supporting them in that.",

It\u2019s just that doctors and patients can hear the same exact words and understand totally different things.\n\n\nA doctor can tell a patient with cancer \u201cYou\u2019re really responding well to chemo...Better than average!\u201d  They might not be lying to the patient, they may be a better responder.  However, if you don\u2019t just see one case of pancreatic cancer, but dozens through your training and career, then your concept of \u201caverage\u201d is a lot different that a patient\u2019s.  The \u201caverage\u201d might be 9-12 months...the \u201cbetter than average\u201d might be 15-20 months (with a couple months in either direction).\n\n\nBut if you\u2019re a patient and not in the medical field, then your case of pancreatic cancer is probably the only one you\u2019ve ever experienced (maybe seen one or two at most if you have a lot of friends).  So when *you* hear \u201cYou\u2019re doing better than average...\u201d you can translate this as \u201cI\u2019m beating this...\u201d\n\n\nP.S.  It\u2019s also very hard for physicians to be brutally honest with patients.  I had to tell a guy that he had hours to days to live the other day.  It\u2019s not a fun conversation.  Especially if the patient or other family members don\u2019t want to believe it\u2019s actually happening.",

You're never really cured of it, but you also don't exactly die of it...you just live for years, continuing to take medications to keep it at bay. \n\nI read an article about a guy who was traveling like once a year (?) to a cancer center to get checked out and maybe get a change in his drug regimen, and then that was it...he just kept taking the drugs and living his life.\n\nSomeone I knew had stage IV cancer and lived for several years on various drugs and other treatments. Again, never really curing it but also mostly not being deathly ill...she did ultimately pass away, but they kept it going for a while. She was in every new drug trial, all that.\n\nI hope your mom's OK. :-)",

Some people get diagnosed earlier or later, even within the same stage. Some people's disease responds to treatment, some don't. There are  something like 6 different subtypes of pancreatic cancer, each with different disease progression and survival.\n\nSurviving just 5 months after diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is not at all unusual. I am sure that your mom wanted to stay with you much longer than she was able to. \n\nSorry again for what you and your family went through. Both my parents died of cancer, and it was indeed terrible. But it's been many years now. The pain of the loss and the immediate experiences around her illness and death will become less sharp over time, and your good memories of her will stay with you.",

It is still considered 'new' despite being around 10+ years. My friends father was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer which on paper has poor survival rates, but is increasingly being successfully treated with immunotherapy. He received this treatment in Canada at no cost.\n\nedit - Some more info about immunotherapy for cancer. Immunotherapy works by reprogramming your own immune cells to recognize the specific cancer in your body. A Stage IV diagnosis means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, which is what makes it so serious. Immunotherapy allows the immune system to specifically target the pancreatic cancer all over the body, making it an especially promising treatment because it can work for Stage IV diagnoses that are harder to treat.",

The 17% seems to be population data meaning all stage 4 ovarian cancers in a country are tracked and their survival averaged, while most of them we presume get treatment, not all of them do, but it'd still be in that ballpark for people who are being actively treated.  Without treatment, survival is usually a few to several months. \n\nI'm sure your aunt's oncologist has looked into this already but if she had breast and ovarian cancer, there's a fair chance this could be hereditary (BRCA mutation specifically). While that is helpful for the family, it does open more more treatment options if she does have that BRCA mutation. Her survival would be much better assuming she can get the drug, the most recent studies have survival at 50% at 4 years with a BRCA targeted drug.",

Pancreatic cancer has poor survival rates on paper, although it seems to be an especially good candidate for immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is still a relatively new form of cancer treatment despite being around for 10+ years. My friends father was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer, and was successfully treated with immunotherapy in Canada at no extra cost to the family 3 years ago.",

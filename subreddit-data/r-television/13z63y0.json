The Walking Dead was based off of a long running comic book series and was meant to go for as long as it could. TLoU told a drama between two people in a Zombie apocalypse that is a self contained 1 season story based off of a video game.\n\nIt's like comparing The Boys with Watchmen because they're both have superheroes when they're both telling entirely different stories with entirely different goals.\n\nOr comparing True Grit to Deadwood because they're both westerns \n\nThey'll appeal to two different audiences. And the length of time doesn't matter if the story is meant to be completed and is already written front to back.",

You can clearly see a tonal change and diminishing quality when he left. It\u2019s either that, or the comics were never as good as everyone thought in the first place. I\u2019d like/want to lean towards the former.",

HBO isn't other networks where all their shows decline.\n\n\nHere's my thing about TWD. It would have long stretches, 5-8 episodes, where it was dreadfully boring. Even a show like GOT where almost everyone believes it declined, it didn't bore you. That's the gigantic strike against TWD. Closest comparison to TWD I can think of that HBO has done is Westworld, where people stopped caring, but that was a pretty rare failure where both critics and viewers both dropped off the show after a hot start.",

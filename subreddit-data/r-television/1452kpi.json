Wanda vision top tier comedy )\n\n6) Hawkeye and she Hulk. (Hawkeye impressed with with few scenes like Kate being inspired by hawkeye during battle of new York, trick arrows, larpers &amp; where as she Hulk had good action in episode 1 and episode 8)\n\n7) unpopular opinion: i didn't enjoy loki.",

            "comment": "I'm confused by what you consider a \"women centric\" show since Hawkeye and Agents of SHIELD had a man and woman sharing the main character spotlight (really the early seasons of SHIELD were more about Coulson than Skye), and Loki is definitely male centric though with an extremely prominent female antagonist.\n\nSo for the truly female-centric shows, I would say Wandavision &gt; She-Hulk &gt; Ms. Marvel &gt; Agent Carter &gt; Jessica Jones for me personally. (If we're adding in the other three, I'd place Agents of SHIELD first, Hawkeye second (maybe third; can't decide whether I liked it or WandaVision better overall), and Loki fourth.)",

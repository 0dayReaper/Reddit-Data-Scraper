I\u2019m not convinced that Chuck fits that criteria for me. \n\nI don\u2019t, however, think the argument that a reboot would ruin the memory of the original holds water. Barring a reboot that cancels an ongoing series, which obviously isn\u2019t the case here, reboots do nothing to the original. It will always be and shall continue to be what it was. You could argue that a poorly done new product could turn newcomers off the old one, but given that I doubt new people are gravitating toward Chuck in significant numbers, I don\u2019t think that argument stands either. \n\nI think that to suggest that someone shouldn\u2019t touch a series out of respect for its legacy elevates television to a degree of sacredness that it can\u2019t really claim. I\u2019m sure exceptions exist, but as fond as I am of Chuck, I don\u2019t think this lighthearted spy comedy/drama show is such an outlier.",

In the whole last episode it we got glimpses of how Sarah apparently got some of her memories back and also how she wasn't quite unaffected by Chuck's charms.  \nTo me it was pretty clear that even if she didn't get her memories back, she would have fallen in love with him again anyway.",

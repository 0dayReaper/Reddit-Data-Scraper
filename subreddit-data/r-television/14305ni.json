    "postText": "Anyone else watching Slip on Roku? It's pretty great; Zoe Lister Jones plays a woman who ends up in an alternate universe every time she orgasms. She also wrote and directed it. One review said it was a bit of Russian Doll with a dash of Broad City/Sex and the City and I think that's a pretty accurate description.  \n\n\nAnyway. You don't have to have the Roku app, you can watch on the Roku Channel website. The show is free. (And while you're there, check out the HILARIOUS Mapleworth Murders, starring Paula Pell from Girls5Eva/Wine Country/SNL.)",

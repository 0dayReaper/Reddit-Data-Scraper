One way of thinking about this (the completely wrong way) is that Terry Crews is sabotaging the movie by not dropping the lawsuit.  The other (correct) way of thinking about this is that Sylvester Stallone is sabotaging the movie but not dropping his scumbag molester manager.  \n\n3. Best of luck, Terry.  Ruin that fuckface's life.  You probably weren't the only person he assaulted.  Think of all the other people without as much clout as you he could have victimized.  If this movie doesn't get made, it will be for a good cause. ",

This guy almost certainly has a long list of similar behaviors, and probably worse ones.\n\nI mean, if this guy is comfortable with sexually assaulting fucking Terry Crews, who has respect, fame, and clout (and could also crush your head with his hand like a watermelon exploding), then imagine what awful things this guy has done to people who aren't famous, who have no power, and who are not physically intimidating.",

Some return for a sequel, with even more action stars than before.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that no Hollywood Exec is worried about losing Terry Crews on a film whose previous installment had:\n\n&gt;Jet Li,\u00a0Sylvester Stallone,\u00a0Jason Statham,\u00a0Antonio Banderas,\u00a0Wesley Snipes,\u00a0Dolph Lundgren,\u00a0Kelsey Grammer,\u00a0Randy Couture,\u00a0Terry Crews,\u00a0Kellan Lutz,\u00a0Ronda Rousey,\u00a0Glen Powell,\u00a0Victor Ortiz,\u00a0Mel Gibson,\u00a0Harrison Ford\u00a0and\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nBasically, other than Stallone, the cast is all *expendable.*  They have smal roles that could be interchanged for another actor at the drop of a feather.  The films are stupid, the plot is shit, and who is in it meaningless overall.  No one working on putting together that productions is going to lose sleep if they get away with just dropping him.\n\nTerry may be a big name on Reddit, but let's not kid ourselves.  He's far from the top earner on that list.\n\nMaybe they drop him.  Maybe they give him limited screen time and kill off his character.  Whatever it is, they're not going to admit it's due to the lawsuit.\n\nWe need more press about this issue, and other big names in that cast to say something  publically, in order to put the pressure on.",

(This dynamic of power can be any dynamic of power, not just making movies.)\n\nThe Subordinate lets it happen because they're afraid of being immediately fired from a career they feel they need. To reiterate, the Subordinate is forced into a position to either accept sexual assault or potentially lose their *livelyhood*.\n\nNow sure, at this point the Subordinate can go to the police. Let's say they do. Rape charges are brought against the person with power and if the Subordinate is lucky, the person in power goes to jail. The Subordinate eventually loses their job because they brought charges against a high level employee and became a liability.\n\nNow the Subordinate looks for another job in their field, but no one will hire them because they've publicly proven that they'll stand up to injustice and will be a liability, or the jailed person in power has powerful friends. Now the Subordinate has not only lost their job, but also their career.\n\nMean while, there are rapist-sympathizers out there announcing to the world that what the person in power did was made up or not *that* serious and that the Subordinate just wants attention or money. This message gets echoed enough that the lay person doesn't truly know if the Subordinate was assaulted or was making it up. To an employer, this is enough to pick someone else for a job over the Subordinate. \n\nPeople (like some others in this thread) who passionately believe that going to the police can have zero repercussions start believing that because they didn't go to the police until years later, they MUST only be in it for the attention. Particularly dumb people of this nature light houses on fire or send death threats in their rage. \n\nSo, because they decided to go to the police, the Subordinate has now lost their job and perspective career, been smeared by rapist-sympathizers into losing their reputation, and is recieving potentially life threatening treatment from their neighbors who don't believe them.\n\nBut if they don't go to the police, life continues as normal. They live with a bad memory and advance in their career. Their life doesn't burn down around them.\n\nTo those that doubt what Im saying, we're in a comment section of an article with Terry fucking Crews saying someone is threatening his career if he doesn't drop this lawsuit. And there are rapist-sympathizers here saying \"Oh, SURELY hollywood isn't a broken system controlled by an elite few, he'll work again. He's just being dramatic.\" ",

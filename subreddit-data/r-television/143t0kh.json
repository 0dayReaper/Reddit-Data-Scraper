    "postText": "For anyone who hasn't seen heroes it was originally supposed to be an anthology story with each season following a different group of heroes but after the first season became arguably the biggest show on tv the network forced them to stick with the same characters and having not planned any story for them after the first season it quickly turned into an unwatchable mess. What are some other shows that fail after one great season of tv?",

Fox had all the good writers, able to attract the best talent, and was even at top of their game in the film industry.\n\nI would argue that Prison Break was good up to season 2, but yeah, the drop in quality thanks to the bad writing, becomes more than obvious. It was also around that time when Fox started becoming shit, canceling all the good shows, etc.",

I still watched it to the end and enjoyed the awesomely-badness of it, but the quality kept falling off a clip with each season.",

That season was the confirmation that the show went off the rails, if we didn\u2019t already see hint of it in season 2. Season 2 wasn\u2019t that bad in my opinion, it was when they started rehashing the same scenario through the bad writing, putting characters back in prison for the sake of it. T-Bag was enjoyable in the first two season but then his character mutated into a \u201cgood guy\u201d, like we can spend hours making bullet points of everything that went wrong. They even had the gall to make season 5. I just get sad talking about this. Amazing show, amazing cast, terrible writing season 2 onwards.",

Second season added a bunch of unnecessary characters, and interpersonal drama, that completely killed the vibe of the show. It was basically 180 from the tone and style of the first season.\n\nDark Angel. First season was amazing. Second season added a bunch of unnecessary and silly plot lines. Viruses, mutants, cults, religious prophecies. The first season just dove to far into the science fiction rabbit hole, rather than maintaining the balance of the first season. It had its moments, but mostly was no where near the quality of season 1.",

The fact we have been following the villain the whole time, on rewatch you start to recognise the signs.\n\nThen season 2 was released &amp; that nonlinear structure is turned up to 11. The show collapses in on itself as it tries to outsmart its audience instead of telling a worthwhile story. For me personally I became completely detached from the show during season 2, I was kind of in denial the first few weeks because I was hoping that my love for season 1 interfered with my enjoyment of season 2. It felt like the whole season they wanted to keep the audience in the dark, &amp; that is fine, Twin Peaks is one of my favourite shows but even when you are in the dark about the mysteries in Twin Peaks the show still has so much heart &amp; strong characters, so you aren't just counting down the hours waiting for the truth to be revealed. Season 2 of Westworld was so cold &amp; disconnected both in terms of story &amp; characters. There is nothing in season 2 that would make me want to revisit it.\n\nThe great thing about Westworld is the fact you can watch season 1 as a standalone story.",

Yeah, it had an open ending, but not one that felt to me like it was meant to be followed up - that was just how it ended. The ending of *Inception* isn't a setup for a sequel where we find out whether or not the top fell, you know?\n\nThe second season actually starts off pretty good, with a prequel/flashback episode. But then the rest of the season just feels *off*, and it's tough to put your finger on *why* until it becomes clear that this season isn't interested in telling its own story like the first season did, but is instead all about setting up a *third* season. And then it ends on a big cliffhanger that was clearly meant to get audiences excited to find out how they get themselves out of this dire situation...\n\nAnd that's it. Show got cancelled.\n\nMaybe a third season would have retroactively made the second season good (that kinda happened with *Mr. Robot*), but without it, season 2 feels like a huge step down, from something unique and shocking to something generic that does nothing but tee up the \"next thing\" that will never come.",

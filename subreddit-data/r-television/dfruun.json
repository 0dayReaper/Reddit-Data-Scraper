If I remember correctly, it was more of a side joke in 201 than a central plot point.\n\n Instead of playing the episode that was supposed to reveal who Cartman's father was, they played an 'April Fools' prank and aired an episode dedicated to Terrance and Phillip, which pissed a whole bunch of people off.\n\n... I personally really like the Terrance and Phillip episode though, but that's just me \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

AND HOW YOU USE THE INTERNET WILL INFLUENCE YOUR SOCIAL CREDIT SCORE.\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7529453/Chinese-internet-users-pass-facial-recognition-test-use-web.html\n\n\nThey also placed a MILLION Muslims into \"reeducation\" camps and forced the women to have abortions.\n\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/inside-chinas-re-education-camps-women-raped-sterilised-10879874/\n\nYou can't even read a book that shames the government elites because the guy who sells the book can be kidnapped and made to publicly apologize and shame himself for selling books that shame the government.That's messed up, and there in America Colbert is just going off every night mocking the president for being a moron.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances\n\nhttps://youtu.be/F_KlNNuMVxo\n\nI mean what about harvesting organs? I get the rights of prisoners in America are fucked up because they make pennies for the hour and most can't vote, not to mention the rapings... But at least no one is going to be slaughtered like a pig for organs that only the rich and privileged can get. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/china-is-harvesting-organs-from-detainees-uk-tribunal-concludes\n\nWhat about banning Winnie the pooh because Xi the ~~ dictator~~ president has thin skin? He doesn't like people pointing out physical similarities and that Winnie the pooh can potentially become a symbol of \"Fuck China\". So the communist party of China bans the movie Christopher robin.\n\nLook if you can be so petty to ban stop your people, over a **billion** people to see a MOVIE. Just think about what kind of control he has over the news. The news CCTV is state run. Everyone in China watching the news is thinking \"oh hey China says China is good. That's great.\"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/07/china-bans-winnie-the-pooh-film-to-stop-comparisons-to-president-xi\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/08/china-state-tv-suspends-nba-broadcasts-after-morey-hong-kong-tweet.html",

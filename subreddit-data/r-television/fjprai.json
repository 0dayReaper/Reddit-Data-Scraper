I have some famous friends.. and it's insane the number of people who they touch in a day. So you throw a big group of them together and it's like bringing a huge group of people together. Think of it this way: You get 100 celebrities/politicians together who have touched 100 people each in a day (not at all far fetched) it's the equivalent of bringing **10,000** people together. It's worse than tho because you have to also think about all of the people those 10,000 people touched. A person in that position is probably one or two degrees of contact away from 50k-100k people every day.\n\nThe second thing is that this is FAR more widespread than people think. We're underreporting in the hundreds of thousands of cases. You bring those two things together and it makes total sense that these folks are going to be among the first to catch it.",

I had not been in contact with anyone I knew to have coronavirus. That basically meant I could not get tested for coronvavirus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I was tested for the flu, and that was negative. I got a full viral panel to see if it was anything else. That was negative. Once that came back, I was told by New York Presbyterian Hospital that I had to go home and self quarantine, because my symptoms were not bad enough to get admitted into the hospital. If you aren't admitted, you don't get tested.\n\nIf I'm understanding this right, there are two ways to get tested for Covid-19 right now:\n\n1. You have to say you were in contact with someone you know has tested positive for coronavirus.\n2. Failing that, you have to have severe symptoms, get admitted into a hospital, and then you get tested.\n\nIn Elba's video, he said he was in contact with someone who tested positive, and that's why he got tested. That corroborates what Goldman said.",

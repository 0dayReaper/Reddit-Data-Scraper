Tucker Carlson. \n\nShe is an Alpha Phi from Alabama and got a job with Carlson at The Daily Caller (NOT The Daily Wire, which is Shapiro\u2019s bullshit rag) directly out of college. \n\nShe started I believe as an \u201centertainment\u201d reporter and *I\u2019m sure* she graduated to the press pool at the White House with Trump on her journalistic merits and *certainly not* because her bosses knew her looks and far-right bonafides would help her become a favorite of Trump at the press conferences\u2026\n\nThen she met Jeff Zucker who ran CNN, and who is a notorious sleazeball who got fired for banging his subordinate for 10+ years while married and running a *company whose product as **supposed** to be ethics and journalism*, and who *I\u2019m sure* hired her to CNN on purely her merits as someone with a whopping 2.5 years of journalism experience with a far right wing joke of a publication, and not because she\u2019s a hot sorority girl who stole Demi Moore\u2019s voice who he wanted to bang. \n\nShe\u2019s so full of shit it\u2019s coming out here eyeballs. \n\nShe goes around saying she grew up in an \u201capolitical\u201d family ***in Alabama***, and she just happened to get a job with one of the most far right organizations started by and run by one of the most far right people in the country (Carlson), but she\u2019s def not a far right person\u2026 \n\nShe just *happened* to build a excellent rapport with the entirety of the cabinet and employees of the White House during the most far-right presidency in the last 100+ years, and her excellent relationship with far right wing people in charge of the most far right wing government we\u2019ve had in my lifetime got helped her get her job at CNN. \n\nAnd her excellent and cozy relationship with far-right politicians is the reason Trump felt comfortable doing a town hall with her produce and aired by the news organization that was his sworn enemy the past 20 years. \n\nBut she\u2019s definitely *not* a far-right wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. \n\nI do have one question tho\u2026\n\nDid she let Trump run ragged all over her corpse during that town hall because she likes and supports him and wants him to win the election???\n\nor\u2026 \n\nIs she just a terrible journalist who can\u2019t rein in a senile elderly AF moron at her own place of employment doing the job she \u201cstudied her whole life for\u201d and she was only given the jobs and opportunities she\u2019s had because she\u2019s been  using the womanly gifts she *does possess* to get to the top?\n\nI\u2019m not sure which of these two options it is, but both options aren\u2019t exactly steeped in journalistic integrity. \n\nAnd tbh I never thought she was using her looks and sorority girl wiles to play on the predilections of the sleazy dirty old men to get to where she is until I watched her let Trump make a fool of her and bulldoze her at that town hall with nearly zero pushback against his psychotic bullshit and realized she\u2019s never once shown any inkling of promise as a respectable journalist.",

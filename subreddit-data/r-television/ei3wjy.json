So when I was watching Event Horizon, I remember thinking that somehow I was being fucked with because it was seriously like Dead Space: The Movie. That was when I learned that Visceral made Dead Space because they were such big fans of Event Horizon and it was basically their tribute to it, which was super cool I thought.",

These cause evolution into predictable and useful forms. These evolved races spread throughout the galaxy but run into an issue with power. Eventually this leads them to discover their black marker and realize that it produces a ton of energy for nothing.\n\nThis causes them to make a bunch of duplicate markers (red markers) which they learn to do because the original one imparts the knowledge into people smart enough to follow through. Eventually exposure to these new markers causes insanity, which in turn leads to murder. As the bodies pile up they are reanimated by the marker, and work to pile all the dead flesh together near a third type of specially designed marker. When there are enough bodies near it a convergence event happens, causing all the corpses to form into a new brethren moon. The moon then proceeds to summon its fellows who then exterminate all life.\n\nEveryone goes back to sleep until the next set wakes them up. So basically the reapers from mass effect.",

Nothing like hearing him frantically yelling \"dude wtf, get out of the corner and help me\" while I'm looking around some feverish vision trying to figure out what he's talking about, where I am, and where he is. Oh and now I'm getting attacked too.\n\nThat said, I understand Dead Space 3 was more actiony, less horrory than it's predecessors, and that's the main complaint right? I didn't have the first two to compare to, so were there any other big issues like story? DS3 was pretty forgettable honestly.",

I'm not knocking it, but it just isn't what I seek out.  \n\nThe first two Dead Space games are survival horror done extremely well.  So well that even a guy like me has to stop and sing their praises.  \n\nBoth 1 and 2 were played solo, which helps add to the fear and suspense.  I think it was Resident Evil 6 that had similar problems where they introduced coop, and the fact that your buddy is there just kills the fear/suspense angle, so what the game is selling is not quite what it is delivering by that point.  Dead Space 3 had pieces of its predecessors, but it was just a whole different offering that felt very underwhelming and out of place by comparison.\n\nAnyhow, TL;DR, you are missing out on some fantastic games and I highly encourage you to go play Dead Space 1 if you get the chance.  You'll probably seek out Dead Space 2 on your own after.",

As you said, they ruined the practical effects works by covering them with obvious CGI which ruins the tactile feeling of a physical object in the space with the actors.\n2. However, I also feel that the creature design was not as inspired because Bottin was not involved.  There was an alluring method to Bottin's madness and the appearance of his creatures elicited something repulsive on a subconscious level for me.  They were unutterable hideous in a way that I still cannot articulate.  The creature design is the prequel was, for me, totally ordinary.  It was mostly just teeth and eyes and tentacle, but no suggestion of the hideous hybridization of otherworldly forms that Bottin concocted.\n3. What happened to \"the chameleon strikes in the dark?\"  It seemed to me that most of the time that the creature attacked, it was in a brightly lit room surrounded by people, or in a location that was not secure enough to allow for complete absorption.  This Thing didn't exhibit any sense of intelligence, which to me is FAR more frightening.  Much like the dog alien in \"Alien 3\", the Thing is merely a monster that pops out at random instead of becoming a thinking, reasoning character.\n4. That rotating tower of oscillating digital cubes inside the spaceship was the LAZIEST computer effect I've ever seen.  It's like they got to the end and just said: \"Fuck it.\"",

Some of which are virtually never going to look bad when used properly, because it\u2019s basically all real... its just composited together. What you see in this breakdown is mostly just color grading, compositing and rotoscoping. \n\nThese types of effects aren\u2019t just used in movies with unreal landscapes like Mad Max... they\u2019re also used in movies that take place in present day reality - https://vimeo.com/83523133 You\u2019d never notice those effects in Wolf of Wall Street, because it\u2019s just compositing real imagery with other real imagery and touching it up. \n\nWhere VFX can go wrong is in the creation of creatures and objects that do not exist in reality... that\u2019s where things can start to look like shit to the viewer. A great solution to this is to use practical effects like puppetry in combination with the computer generated VFX. This can be more time consuming and costly though... so it\u2019s not always the first choice depending on the project.",

I guess Charlize Theron doesn\u2019t actually have a robot hand in real life. The end is mostly showing INSANE practical effects with the digital effects that finish/enhance the scene with things that would have been insanely difficult, maybe impossible, to have actually done. I dunno if that\u2019s the point you were try to make, but seriously that looks like less visual effects than Wolf of Wallstreet used.",

Ever since the prequel trilogy, studios have been acting like people can't tell the difference, or cutting corners by doing *really* cheap CGI instead.  It blows my mind that studios execs are so conned by the word \"computer\" in CGI that they act like those effects are automatically more convincing just because the tech is newer.  They completely ignore critics and lower-tier workers like amateur directors until it hits the point that for some reason it requires Werner Herzog to intervene.  Werner Herzog had to tell them to use a puppet when literally thousands of professionals and millions of fans could have told them the same thing.\n\nNot only are practical effects (puppets, animatronics, miniatures) usually more convincing, but they're usually cheaper too.  Yes, there are some shots where CGI is needed, but most of the time it's just some old studio exec who's tricked when they see the word \"computer\" in CGI, therefore it's better.  It's literally no different than some boomer sending an e-Card for Christmas instead of mailing an actual card.\n\nA mix of practical and digital is best.  But studios roll it like 90d/10p when it should be more like 20d/70p.  A great example of this is Rocket and Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nThe fact that Splinter from TMNT (25 years ago) and Yoda (40 years ago) both look more like a real creature than Rocket Raccoon is embarrassing.",

Silly, as you've shown with one of the greatest examples of prime time puppetry ever and Henson himself had no intention of making work for kids until he was older and had essentially given up on adults. \n\nDinosaurs was filled with lessons on racism, sexism, ageism, consumerism and of course, environmental stewardship. Yet somehow, all anyone remembers is a kid hitting their dad and screaming \"not the mama!\"",

It\u2019s /everywhere/ and you usually don\u2019t notice it, *if it\u2019s done well*. There are certainly \u201cgood enough\u201d attempts that you know are off, but you can look past because of other qualities or budget constraints. There\u2019s also bad ones from cutting corners and not caring. \n\nBut I would argue that most video watchers, even ones with a good eye for detail, don\u2019t recognize over half the CGI uses in their everyday media though.

If you spend a day looking for actual good CGI examples, part of the skill required in good CGI is making it blend in to the point where a scene you wouldnt even have considered, has it. \n\nThe most recent one that blew me away was in Logan where he walks past his clone; it wasn't just a seperate shot, or anything like that, they CGI'd Hugh Jackman onto his stunt double. I didn't even consider that they would do that since that's not how doubles are usually done. But damn does it look good.",

Everyone knows what it's going to look like.\n\nWhat happens with the poor lifeless weightless CGI is no prep is made for the VFX artist. They aren't given the info to simulate the set. The set is set up in a way to deal with the limitations of CGI or help the artists out. Too much is put on the artists with a director who doesn't understand the tech. \n\nLet's not pretend there has never been bad puppetry and models.",

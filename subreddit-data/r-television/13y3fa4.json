    "postText": "I started watching Safe Home last night on SBS On Demand. Then I couldn't stop watching it until the end. It was midnight.\n\nIt's a 4-part mini-series about a young woman who starts a new job in a family violence legal service, although the show tells the lives of 3 other women very effectively in what is only about 4 hours.\n\nWhilst it concentrates on female victims, it isn't preachy (I would have stopped watching) and doesn't hide or shy away from the fact that men can be victims and women can be perpertrators. It's the best piece of Australian drama I have seen in some time, which is a shame given we are a bit strapped for good television. It's gritty, doesn't tone down any violence (although it's mostly shown in flashes of memory as opposed to any lingering scenes) and shows how widespread the issue is, the problems facing everyone involved, but also how it can manifest. Not all of it is violent.\n\nIf you have access to SBS On Demand, I highly recommend it.\n\nWatch Safe Home streaming now on SBS On Demand.\n\nhttps://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/program/safe-home",

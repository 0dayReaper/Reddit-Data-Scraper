Wheel of Fortune is a bit of a butt monkey amongst Game Show fandom, the show is stale and badly needs an update, but it\u2019s still fun to watch. Pat is the last of the old guard of game show hosts still active, his loss is a big one.",

Heartaches are seemingly inevitable. Family dies. Sometimes friends die. Childhood celebrities die. \n\nIt's nice to have a connection to the past. For us, that was always The Simpsons, Price is Right with Bob Barker, Wheel of Fortune with Pat Sejack and Vannah White, and Jeapordy with Alex Trebek. \n\nAnd even if you haven't watched Wheel of Fortune in years, it's still one of the last things on that list that still exists. So it's kind of sad when one more thing gets crossed off that list.......and we get one more grey hair. \n\n.............unless you still have perfect hair, in which case screw you, ya jerk!",

The show is extremely tight now, with almost no wasted time, in order to ensure maximum commercial time. In Bob\u2019s day the production was a lot looser, Bob had plenty of time and freedom to vamp with the contestants and the audience, and his improvisational banter is what made the show so great.",

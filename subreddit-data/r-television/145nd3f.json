            "comment": "From what I read:\n\n'Guild negotiations team members acknowledged that the union did not get everything it wanted, including a guaranteed additional promotional run and expansion of the DGA\u2019s jurisdiction beyond the U.S. and Canada, \u201cbut the things we didn\u2019t get, we\u2019ll get the next time around.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne guild executive told members during the Zoom:\n\n\"the DGA doesn\u2019t think it did anything to \u201churt\u201d the WGA and SAG-AFTRA negotiations still in progress, and the DGA hopes their own deal language will help them. \u201cThis is a great deal, just so everybody knows. You got amazing gains,\u201d said one leader.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne DGA member liked the deal but is worried it doesn\u2019t do enough on AI protection: \u201cAI can\u2019t replace us, but if they use it for actors and writers, that would create a domino effect that could eventually replace us.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOthers were harder on the pact. Calling the DGA a \u201cVichy guild,\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother dual WGA-DGA member said,\n\n\"that while the foreign residuals increase was solid, the annual pay increases did not make up for inflation and the union\u2019s deal made during the 2020 COVID-era negotiations. The AI provision, meanwhile, seemed to this member like a \u201cdeal-breaker.\u201d\n\nA third member who plans on voting no said,\n\n\u201cWe need to tie our compensation to the success of our work. The leverage we had was historic and the negotiation committee and DGA leadership squandered it.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther DGA-only members spoke out against the agreement on social media, including Peter Ramsey (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse).\n\n\u201cWhat does it matter if there are nominal increases residuals IF these platforms can disappear your show for tax purposes,\u201d tweeted Matthew A. Cherry (Hair Love, Young Sheldon).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLarry Charles, the hyphenate union member who wrote on Seinfeld and directed Borat, shared a video explaining his decision to reject the deal. \u201cThe leaders of the Directors Guild struck \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 quite a good deal.\n\n\"It improves everything for everybody across the board \u2026 in the Directors Guild.\u201d He said, \u201cSo while I\u2019m grateful to be in the Directors Guild, I found my conscience tugging at me, saying, \u2018you can\u2019t leave everyone else behind.\u2019 So I voted no to this contract.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, several prominent dual members of both the WGA and the DGA expressed resistance to the pact on social media.\n\nDuncan Jones (Moon, Warcraft), Steven DeKnight (Daredevil, Pacific Rim Uprising), Sofia Alvarez (Along for the Ride, To All the Boys I Loved Before), Christopher Cantwell (Halt and Catch Fire) and Gary Scott Thompson (The Fast and the Furious) all indicated that they were voting no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure what any of this means. It seems like the \"historic deal\" was just  talk and the DGA fumble the bag.\n\nWhy does it seem the DGA board has this elitist \"we don't have to strike because we're directors\"  attitude? Not the directors it seems, but the board.\n\nThey're in the best position to gain a crazy advantage and it seems like they settle for less imo\n\nI suspect they will have keep the deal.",

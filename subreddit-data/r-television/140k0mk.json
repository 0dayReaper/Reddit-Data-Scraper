Some of the best shit is when he has a guest like Tyler the creator or someone who thinks they know what they are getting into and he just makes it that much more insane.",

I don't think streamers value having creative people on the corporate side or experienced showrunners the way HBO or FXX does and the quality suffers.\n\nAlmost any quality \"streaming original\" you can think of is produced by people who give a shit at a legacy studio (Handmaid's Tale is MGM for instance, Ted Lasso is NBC &amp; WB, etc).",

That\u2019s obviously going to hit #1.\n\nNow let\u2019s imagine there\u2019s a slower week with no major popular releases and viewership that week is either particularly low or just much more fractured, and maybe you only need 1 million viewers to watch your show that week to hit #1.\n\nNow, 1 million viewers in a week is still respectable, but there are literally orders of magnitude between the success of a show that gets viewership of 50%/100 million and a show that gets 0.5%/1 million.\n\nAnd yet in the right circumstance both could plausibly hit the #1 metric that is the only hard number we currently get for the success of a show.\n\nNot knowing where their particular show falls is a major disadvantage for writers in negotiations, which is why I think that\u2019s such an important ask.",

Bad Trip had already been on Amazon Prime and wasn't sold to Netflix until a full year after its premier; my guess is it was a deal completely based on residuals.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how Netflix residual deals work. I'd guess it's similar to how music streaming works: there's a big pot of subscriber money, and it gets distributed based on what people are watching. So the top movies/shows would make a lot and less watched ones make absolutely nothing.",

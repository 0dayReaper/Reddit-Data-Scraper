    "postText": "Ted Lasso, Barry, and of course Succession. Have we ever had so many finales so close together, and of such universal acclaim? Taskmaster S15 is ending tomorrow too. I've been having a blast, and won't know what to do with myself now that they're all finished up! \n\nThese shows are so good because of the writing. With the writer's strike, it truly feels like a feast before a famine, and I'm happy to gorge myself- those finales will be rattling around my head for many months.",

Now everything has to air by May 31st so it led to all these shows ending more or less at the same time.\n\nI suppose coincidentally a lot of those shows were also in their final seasons. Really feels like the end of an era.",

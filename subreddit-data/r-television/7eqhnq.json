But 4chan has become bizarrely radical right wing in recent years. To the point of sheer insanity and self destruction. I read through a few 4chan threads about net neutrality on various boards recently, and the number of people in favor of what the FCC is doing was shocking. Their arguments can be summed up as:\n\nPartisan politics:\n\n* I hate Reddit so I'm against anything they like\n\n* I hate liberals so I'm against anything they like\n\n* I hate big tech, Twitter Google etc, so....\n\nDenial:\n\n* The left is overreacting and ISPs won't actually restrict the internet like they claim\n\nCondescension:\n\n* When they do restrict the internet it'll just get rid of idiots and \"normies\" who can't figure out a way around it\n\nAnti-americanism:\n\n* Fewer Americans on the internet sounds great\n\nWhen the few people attempt to point out logical fallacies and present evidence, they tend to just start name calling.\n\nTl;dr I don't think we can depend on the \"hacker known as 4chan\" this time.\n\n(edits: formatting)",

It's a lot easier to win them over to the side of racism if they're already comfortable on some level with racism. Real racists rarely view themselves as such and have strong mental rationalizations for why they hate the way that they do and converting people to their ideology through humor, feelings of positivity and expanding someone's comfort zone into the borders of hatred works frighteningly well.",

I've copied it below in case anyone wants to use some of it for their own message:\n\n\n&gt;Everyone on the FCC roster: Ajit, Mignon, Mike, Brendan, Jessica,\n\n&gt;Please do not repeal net neutrality! This proceeding has no benefit for consumers across the U.S.; rather, this only benefits the Telecom giants by handing over monopolistic advantages to them.\n\n&gt;Ajit, your philosophy is that the free market will better serve U.S. citizens than a managed regulated market. This is a fine sentiment, but as you must know from your studies of economics, de-regulation only works when you have perfect competition: when numerous small firms compete against one another. What we have is an Oligopoly, where a few large firms dominate the market. To boot, they have geographical monopolies wherein only they are allowed by law to serve certain cities and locations! De-regulation will only serve to encourage these companies to abandon innovation and efficiency to win customers in favor of simply gouging customers who have no choice but to buy their product. How is this in any way American? How does this benefit the American people you are tasked with protecting?\n\n&gt;Internet is a necessity in today's world; to communicate effectively with our families, friends, business associates, and representatives, we use the greatest invention humankind has yet procured. We are able to share thoughts and ideas across not only our vast continent, but with the rest of our fellow humans as well. We have seen mathematical problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable subsequently solved after hundreds of thousands of people worked together to help find a solution. We are witnessing scientific and technological advancements today that only a decade ago were thought to be the works of fiction, because we are able to share our information freely and with ease.\n\n&gt;I implore each and every one of you to consider the American people, and the ethics that we as a country wish to stand for. We should not be viewed - internally and externally - as a country run by profit. This is the land of the free, home of the brave, where our people are encouraged to innovate and invent in a country that protects its people and shows the world our potential. Not just this country's potential, or even its citizens', but the potential of human-kind itself.\n\n&gt;Show that we choose innovation and freedom over endless greed. Vote No on repealing net neutrality.\n",

Copy their address into Gmail or whatever, type something saying you deeply support Net Neutrality and how there are many examples of times where the ISPs have already tried to ruin the internet(take an example from [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6cbckk/net_neutrality_john_oliver_vs_reasoncom_whos_right/dhtdwwi/) or better come up with another example), then say please consider supporting it too. Then finish with your name and your state.\n\nSo like this.\n\n\"Hi I'm writing to you to let you know that I deeply support Net Neutrality. We've already seen the damage that repealing it can do, for example when in 2012 AT&amp;T tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money which wouldn't be allowed under current Net Neutrality rules. If Net Neutrality gets repealed I think they'll do a lot worse than, that they will further block and throttle websites that compete with their products, or even block websites that they just don't agree with which will limit free speech. Competition will be even more non existant than it currently is and prices will also go up. Please support Net Neutrality.  \nThanks. Chuck Norris, OK.\"\n\nEasy, took 2 mins but whatever. I think using an example thats actually happened of the ISPs going against NN helps a lot. Mention that image of Portugal's internet with the different bundles as an example if you want. Or mention how Verizon or whoever throttles Netflix even though you're paying to access it at full speed. Post new ones below me so we're not all using the same few examples.\n\nCopy and send the email to each of the addresses as an individual email, not a single mass one. You're not gonna change Ajits mind but it won't hurt to take 5 seconds to copy the email to him too. It's the others that may change their stance.\n\nBut yeah, 2 mins, do it!

Remember they ALREADY deliberately throttled Netflix traffic in the past, effectively holding their own customers hostage for boardroom negotiations.\n\nThe \"market regulating itself\" is a blatant fallacy, especially when most ISPs have only a single competitor (or none at all) in their service footprints. \n\nAnd given the monumental cost of breaking into another company's territory, erecting your own infrastructure, and then trying to poach those same customers for a competing company, they are all MORE than happy to shit in their own sandboxes right now rather than invest millions in fighting over the same households to create a \"competitive environment\". \n\nSource: I worked a couple years for an ISP, their entire business model is based around 3 year churn of customers buying a \"Triple Play\" package for internet/phone/tv at a discounted rate, abandoning you when the rate expires, then returning at a later date when eligible for it again. Hence why they give zero fucks about customer service, they absolutely could care less about retention.",

The current market place is not only a monopoly in its current form, but repealing these rules will make it a lop-sided in favor of \u201cBig Corporations.\u201d Currently I am supposed to be receiving 200 Mb/s down and 100 up. At current testing I receive 25-50 Mb/s down, on average. I ask you, how much worse will it be if I now have to pay even more to get equal speed when it should be much higher? \n\n&gt;The United States should be the world leader in free and open internet and be the top in its infrastructure. We are the birth place of the internet after all. With current monopolies in place, there is no incentive for Internet Service Providers to invest in infrastructure. Now imagine if this was another utility, say electric power. Would we find it convenient to have our power go out when demand exceeds generation? If we had brown outs or even blackouts at peak times during the day and night?\n\n&gt;Not only should Title II remain in place, it should be expanded and the internet and its infrastructure be deemed a public utility and ISP\u2019s be monitored and incentivized into making the internet the fastest it should be for all United States Citizens. Monopolies should be busted and more public options should be expanded to make the market larger and more competitive, not smaller.\n\nMake your voice heard if not in public, then at least on a public forum via the FCC.\n\nFile your comment here: gofccyourself.com then click \"New Filing,\" fill out the form (file it as a complaint), upload your document, and submit.\n\nE: B to b, too early when I wrote this.

If you have any left at this point in the year its because you came in to work on days when you WERE sick and miserable, and holding out hope that you might get to spend your sick day on yourself...\n\nDo it. Spend your sick day on you. Spend it on your mental health, doing something that refreshes and relaxes you. And hey, since you have the day off now, maybe give a few of those hours to fight for a cause you believe in (because cat videos on youtube relax you when you don't have sick days and netflix is there when you cannot afford a night out).",

But I will say that Even If You\u2019re Right, I would rather Netflix etc win this fight because I can choose to use or not use those services, but I have seen Verizon etc abuse their power countless times... and even when they don\u2019t abuse it, they\u2019re just jerks. When my mother died, Verizon made me show them her death certificate five separate times over two years before they finally believed she was no longer a account holder.\n\nI can\u2019t count the times I\u2019ve wanted to scream at a customer service rep for Comcast or Verizon over the phone- but I didn\u2019t, because it\u2019s not that poor lowly worker's fault that their corporate rules are terrible.. and my small voice wouldn\u2019t change a thing. But now it can.\n\nThis is my chance to show Verizon and Comcast that I\u2019m sick of their shit... and I\u2019m taking it. I hope you do too.",

It is clear to all that big doner money is at play here, the issue cannot be fudged or hid behind. What you are about to do will set the US back and set a dangerous precedent going forward. It is also clear that the anti NN side as acted in bad faith towards the democratic process in their attempts to stifle debate on the issue and engender their side with support. This will not stand. We ask that for this vote that you put aside doner interests and political affiliation and think solely about your children and the many like them that could continue to benefit from all that a free and open internet, uncorrupted by creed or corporate interest. And if you cannot think of them then we remind you of your duty of care, that you are sworn to protect the rights of the citizens whom you serve. You will be remembered for this; one way or the other. And we implore you to make it for something of which you can be proud and honoured to talk about, instead of something that will forever cause your name to be remembered in infamy by your fellow Americans and citizens of the world.\n\nYours Sincerely\nA Citizen \n",

I don't expect him to vote NO though I've also addressed this email to him. Like me Ajit Pai is also a big part of immigrant migration and life here in USA. All the successes i've had with regard to technology, innovation were all due to free and open internet. The internet is the foundation of many innovations including Smartphone and the on-going Artificial Intelligence and Robotics era. Without that we would not have come this far. I'm sure Ajit Pai will also agree. \n\nThe current administration is having a superiority contest with the previous administration and aggressively dismantling Obama-era policies. The healthcare, climate change and now this. There's no common sense to it. \n\nA big precedent on the side of big ISPs and the FCC\u2019s Republican majority is the so-called Vonage Order of 2004. Back when voice over internet protocol was new technology, the state of Minnesota attempted to regulate Vonage\u2019s VoIP service the same as it would traditional phone landlines. The FCC ruled that Minnesota didn\u2019t have that authority, because VoIP is an interstate service. Some phone calls might stay within the state, but there\u2019s no way to separate that part of Vonage\u2019s business from the part that does cross state lines. An appeals court upheld the ruling in 2007. Today VOIP is the backbone of many businesses. Instead of paying big monthly charges for traditional phone lines, now businesses can enjoy high quality calls via Skype, etc. for just pennies to dollar.\n\nAnother precedent is, in 2012 AT&amp;T tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money which wouldn't be allowed under current Net Neutrality rules. Without Net Neutrality rules we will all be paying extra $$ to such services.\n\nTrue to the conscience you all will agree this is not the right thing to do for the citizens of the great country America. \n\nPOTUS Trump and Ajit Pai are not here to \"Make America great again\". They're so backwards in their thinking and determined to \"Make America Worse\" ",

If they are repealed, then not only is the FCC failing the public, they are ignoring the citizen\u2019s demands for a free and open internet. \nThe United States should be the world leader in free and open internet, and be the top in its infrastructure. It is the birth place of the internet after all. \nTitle II should not only remain in place, it should be expanded - and the internet and its infrastructure be deemed a public utility. ISPs should be monitored and incentivized to make the internet as fast as possible for all United States Citizens - without favoritism for specific websites, companies or services. The existing monopolies should be busted, and more public options made available to make the market larger and more competitive - not smaller.\nShould this repeal go through, this will be the textbook case study for regulatory capture for the next 100 years. The World is watching. Increasing regulatory capture and special-interest politics are already degrading American democracy. Do not further this dangerous and destabilizing trend by repealing Title II. \n\nYours sincerely, \n[]\n\nCredit to u/deal_with_it99",

            "comment": "So much happened offscreen. Like the writers were tired, or in a hurry to get where they wanted to be. Nate decided WestHam is not for him! Why is that? One incident at a pub that doesn\u2019t get discussed! Don\u2019t worry about how it turned him, just accept that it did! The whole team forgives Nate and wants him back! How did they get there? No idea\u2014but it happened offscreen and just take our word for it! Ted leaves and everyone is accepting but sad\u2014how did he break that important news? Doesn\u2019t matter but he did and everyone is super chill about it because growth!\n\nWhat was sweet about the first seasons was watching people slowly realize the changes they had to make to grow. And it was touching the way they wrote those discoveries. This season it was all off camera, like the writers couldn\u2019t be bothered to consider the interpersonal reactions that made that growth so interesting. We should just accept that everyone is a bigger person now, automatically!\n\nThe relentless positivity of Ted Lasso worked in the beginning because it showed how we can all let go of our security blanket of cynicism. In the end it was just a parade of automatic optimism that isn\u2019t relatable. The message of \u201cwe can all change\u201d has become \u201cjust be cheerful it will work\u201d. And that rings false.",

                    "comment": "I agree with everyhing you said. This season has a really stinky vibe to it that feels completely artificial. There are no stakes whatsoever. There are far too many narratives to keep up with, many of which feel completely inconsequential to the main story. And just like you say, having all this exposition happening off-screen is a ridiculously cheap way to \"progress\" the story without having to work for it. Despite the episodes being so fucking long, these important plot points don't happen before our eyes, which is just baffling to me. Like, there was clearly time to show us those scenes instead of all the pointless fluff you DID show us. Most of the exposition also feels wholly hamfisted and unjustified, like the team wanting Nate back suddenly with absolutely no explanation as to why. I genuinely thought I'd missed an episode or something where they'd talked about bringing him back at length, but no. The further I get through this season, the more frustrated I get with its many, many flaws. I have never been so angry with a TV show before. The people defending it need to get their eyes and ears checked out, seriously. It's a damn shame.",

The finale didn't suck but it off brand which left many people including me confused and maybe let down because it felt like somebody else took over for season 3 and wrote it themselves.

                    "comment": "Maybe you missed the point\u2026 Ted Lasso did not end as a defeated man\u2026 his story is still going on. His anxiety and depression came from having lost his father at a young age and having a loving but avoidant mother. These feelings only sprang into action when his wife started distancing herself from him (familiar to losing and avoidant behavior exhibited in his childhood). Ted taking this job as a British futbol teams coach was his escape from reality. Having him return to the states in the finale is demonstrative of all the progress he has made during his time away. His jovial nature in the beginning was a mask, a charade, a way for him to disconnect from his suffering. His more solemn, mellow, low toned nature as the show progresses is demonstrative of his progression in accepting and moving forward even though his losses in life have been so great. The finale also shows us that while he went back home and didn\u2019t stay with Richmond, his life continues to change in great big ways. He \u201cstarted off not knowing a single thing about soccer and left knowing at least one thing about futbol\u201d to the point where he now coaches his sons soccer team. His son who he was afraid to get close to because he was afraid that he would lose him too, is now so close not just in distance but to the point where he\u2019s his boys father and coach and guide and light and friend. Things that he would\u2019ve been so afraid of doing prior to his growth and development. And the whole reason I\u2019ve gone on this rant is because we see he arrives back home - to HIS home with HIS family. The wife\u2019s boyfriend isn\u2019t there to welcome him. Nor was he at the soccer game. Signs that he\u2019s out of their lives. Signs that Ted has his life back but it\u2019s even better than it ever was. I cried the entire last season. I feel this whole series is beautiful and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better finale. To have loved and loss is no easy feat and he shows us that absolutely anything is possible if you only BELIEVE.",

He should presumably be \"the happiest\" he's ever been, free of his demons. Instead, walking off the field, he looks hurt but relieved -- I think this is where Ted Lasso gets mental health right, and where TV has historically gotten it wrong.\n\nHurt people who are healing don't exude happiness -- their health relies on their ability to connect to the pain they ignored for much of their life, and it gives them real freedom, even if it changes who they present themselves as to the outside world.\n\nActing happy, living your life at the extremes (either a 1 or a 10 depending on the day) isn't healthy, though it can appear that way to the outside world.",

More on twitter than here tbh.\n\nAnd there's plenty of valid criticism about this season and the show in general, I said I don't think it should be immune from criticism. I do think the show's a shell of its former self and probably got too big for its own good. This season they ruined several characters (Nate and Keeley in particular were hard to watch most of the season), and I agree with the criticism that it was weird how a lot of the emotional moments seem to happen off screen, as if the show was leaning into its status as a security blanket and trying to do what it thought was protecting the audience rather than actual payoffs for the plot it set up. And the show had gotten way too saccharin. It was never a top tier show for me, but I did enjoy watching it right when it came out and being with these characters, in this world. It's comfort food TV that a lot of people latched onto because it came at the perfect time at the height of the pandemic. It probably won too many awards, got praised a little too hard early on and had too much to live up to. \n\nBut, like, both on social media and even in some reviews people are acting like Apple is tying them down and pouring bleach into their eyes, it's been a little much. \n\nThis happens with tons of shows. People miss the boat on something and they start shitting on it to cope, regardless of the actual quality. Happens more often with fandoms like Star Trek or Star Wars (this place was a nightmare when Andor was out) but it's plainly obvious how it can happen with a show like this too.",

Was a waste of screen time. \n\nAnother thing was they fell short of making Ted be Ted. He was sad a lot of the season. I was expecting more funny and lively moments. Don\u2019t get me wrong I loved that they brought his mental health into it but can\u2019t you show us how he gets better? \n\nWhy did they send Ted back to the US? That was so lame. They should have shown how Ted stands up to his ex wife for fucking him over so hard and finding a way to have his son move to England and stay with him for a lot of the year or full time. What does Kansas have for him? An annoying ex wife and the couples counselor who stole his wife? \n\nIt was truly a pathetic ending. I\u2019m disappointed. Only thing Apple TV can do is bring a Season 4 and make this shit better. Also no more off screen stuff. Wtf. Less shit going on, more football, less Keeley. SHIT ENDING SCREW U APPLE \ud83c\udf4e \n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE IS COMING UP BRING BACK HAPPY TED U ASSHOLES \n\nPLEASE RESPOND TO THIS AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS THINK",

Write your own stories if you think you can do better or enjoy one of the many perfect pieces of art that are already in the world. I personally am grateful to the people who contributed to this show for putting something full of a lot of joy, hope and emotional honesty into the world.",

So many funny and heartwarming stories that just made me remember why I love this show so much.\n\nI did not have any issues with Keeley's side story nor that Nate quit off screen. I was a bir surprised by the latter and thought that maybe I skipped an episode but then I was thinking \"what more do I need to know about this?\" Because everything was pretty much explained in a lot of the interaction between him and Rupert. Especially the last episode before he quit.\n\nI do not want to convince anyone to love this show from beginning to end, when they truly think it got so much worse. I just wanted to say I am surprised and my experience is very different.\n\nGreat show, great finale!",

I detest how they forced things in though, things that if you cut them out, nothing's affected on the show. Keeley finally gets a chance to shine and be her own person. What do they do? They decide to bring in an obnoxious person for a best friend, get her into a relationship that served nothing to the story thereby robbing her of her greatness.  Rebecca barely had a storyline this season--her role was all jumbled up. Don't get me started on how they tuned out Roy's and Jamie's roles. Ted, the supposed star of the show (and especially with them ending the whole thing at season 3), it should have been about him more. Otherwise, I'm glad they finished on such a high cause it's truly a great show. So many life lessons to take from.",

His character seemed flat and under-written this season.  While Rebecca was pushing for a win, Ted just kind of stood on the sidelines doing nothing to move the team forward.  Beard was of no help and Roy had the fire but not the skills to truly manage the team.  Also, after the Vanity Fair article I was excited for Keeley's new position as CEO of her own firm.  Her incompetence was astounding and she ended up looking like a silly little girl.  Her romance with Roy always seemed force, but he seemed to bring out the best in her as she did for him.  Just some thoughts.",

            "comment": "Things this season fucked up:\n\n\u25cf The entire tone of the show. There's lots of sesame street comparisons and I think they ring true. So many antidotes about doing the right thing that it feels like there's no real conflict in the show ever, which any good story needs. Also the corny jokes used to be tasteful and more sparse, now we can't escape them.\n\u25cf pretty much every character arc. Ted needed to grow some more self respect and allow himself to be upset when he discoverd his ex wife was dating their marriage counselor, but instead he just handles it the same way he always does as if he never went to therapy the previous season. Keeley's story arc was entirely unnecessary in s3. And don't get me started with Nate. They had a chance to make such an excellent villain out of Nate and they fumbled it from the very first episode. They really fucked his story up. Also, they spent a ton of time getting making the team members bigger characters even though they really didn't have much to add. I think the locker room discussions and silly events were a lot of the worst moments of this season. They could've curbed those scenes and made time for their stronger characters.\n\u25cf The episodes were way too damn long for nothing interesting to happen. The pivot to hour long episodes was such a mistake. Shows that the show really really lost track of what it was.\n\u25cf Instead of focusing on our old favorite characters (especially noticeable is the lack of the title character throughout the season) they introduced so many meaningless new characters. Give me one good reason why they shouldn't have left Zava on the cutting room floor. He did absolutely nothing, served no purpose, detracted from the story and other characters. Other useless or uninteresting/improperly utilized new characters include Jack, the woman working more directly with Keeley, Keeley's model friend that she hires, Rebecca's love interest from Amsterdam (can't even remember their names), and Jade. While I guess many of these characters are somewhat important for the story at hand, I would argue that a different story without these characters that was more focused on the characters we've already grown to love would have been much better.\n\u25cf The show has become less and less about the actual sport. Last night my girl pointed out that the players weren't wearing shin guards during a game. We see more dance numbers at practice than actual training. It's like a satire at this point. Rather than showcasing the team working hard and getting better and Ted learning more about the sport, we're supposed to assume these things have happened behind closed doors. I think this is the biggest thing they did wrong. They had a story, and the personal and interpersonal stuff should have more or less ended at s2. S3 should have been about them training and trying to win it all. It should've been about the sport and the rivalry with West Ham. That would have been a great ending to the series.\n\nIf there's anything I've forgotten please remind me. But this season was straight ass and it makes me so so sad because I really did like the first 2.",

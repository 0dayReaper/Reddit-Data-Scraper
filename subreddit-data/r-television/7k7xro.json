It was his favorite character when he was young and he used to tell me stories about how he used to sneak into his friends house to watch it. Now I watch it with my nephew almost everyday and he loves it. \nThis character has gone down 3 generation and still going strong. Given\u2019s legacy will live on forever! RIP and thank you for this amazing gift to the world. ",

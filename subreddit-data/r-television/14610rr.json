As much as I liked early seasons of the flash, S&amp;L with it's visuals and the kind of storytelling method they chose with it's main theme being on family and telling grounded and human stories with the man of steel instead of being another cw superhero show just makes it feel very tonally different to the rest. I 100% would recommend it, and while there are SOME CW-ism's in the show, it is to a minimum degree and feels distant from it's network's past shows.",

I can tell you that your total revenue is 10*500=$5,000/month and know that that is always true.\n\nHowever say you have 10 lemonade stands with a median revenue of 500/month, but their individual revenues are 10, 10, 10, 10, 500, 500, 590, 590, 590, 590.  Total revenue is only $3,400/month, but I would estimate $5,000 if I tried to do 10*median.\n\nThat's a pretty big difference.  Mean for those stands is only 340 which is 32% lower than the median.  It could also go the other way of the distribution was skewed differently.\n\nSo it really depends on your purpose. Medians are great for comparing two populations or identifying an average that seems more \"typical\" because it excludes outliers...but when you are actually using the statistics as inputs for other calculations, medians have some pretty obvious flaws.  \n\nI think the right answer here is to just report both in many situations.  Or report the median but also report the total and number of observations (so someone could derive the mean, and also so people can see the magnitude we are talking about).",

(Also the natural unpredictability of accidents).  I manage the budget for a fleet of vehicles for the sake of it say we wreck 30 vehicle a month but repairs vary greatly. Most are $1,500-$5,000 but say two are $25,000+. You generally do have one two sometimes three of the $25k in a month.  Now they ask you to project your accident budget based on historical data and the number of accidents per month.  If I did a simple average I would way over estimate because the $25,000(s) would skew my numbers when I multipled by 30.  \n\n\nTo be clear, I still don't have a real answer for how to project budgets on accidents because there are just SO many variables  .",

Total losses are definitely going to be somewhat random (I've done fleet management myself) but there may be trends based on who you have working for your organization at any given time, road utilization levels during times of year, weather patterns, etc. I did an interesting project in school where I developed a prediction model for (an anonymous group of) students' grades. It was pretty ridiculous how well I could predict a student's grade in a given course, or their final GPA, based on factors that a human wouldn't be able to pick up on, such as a handful of demographic points and a couple prior grades.",

The first moment is the mean, the second the variance, the third the skew, etc. As a result, you can progressively represent the distribution more and more accurately and the mean thus has a mathematical virtue that the median does not.\n\nThe mean is also much easier to calculate than the median.\n\nSo when you talk to scientists and mathematicians, they almost invariably use the mean. It's also critical for learning about statistical techniques.\n\nHowever, this tends to mean that people who aren't familiar with the whole story can erroneously regard the mean as 'better' than the median (or the mode).",

I\u2019ll try my best to answer. \n\n- When you join the staff of a show, your services are exclusive to that project. Rooms will ease in with \u201cnormal\u201d days for the first week or so but by the end it\u2019s quite common for staff to be putting in 60-70 hour weeks as they race to finish their materials. So with very rare exceptions, it\u2019s not possible for the average writer to work on two shows at the same time. \n\n- As for working a clean 24 weeks + 24 weeks on two different shows and bouncing between them, it\u2019s virtually impossible. Schedules don\u2019t line up like that. Filming might take longer on one than the other, post-production might be more intensive, or the show release might simply be delayed - all of these things affect the \u201cpickups\u201d that would trigger a new room. (Heck, the first show might even be canceled.) \n\nWhat ends up happening, since writers don\u2019t know if or when their show will come back, is that the moment they finish on Show A, they start looking to see who else is hiring. If they find a project they\u2019re right for, they go through the interview process. If they\u2019re lucky enough to \u201cget the offer,\u201d they try to get Show B to agree to hire them in \u201csecond position\u201d (which means Show B agrees that Show A will always have priority for their services as long as both shows exist.) What usually happens is, because they need to work and they\u2019ve probably been out of a job for a few months by this point, they ask Show A to release them from their contract. So now they\u2019re attached exclusively to Show B, and when that one ends, they start the process over and look for a new job. (This process is especially hard on writing teams, whom the studios insist on paying as one person despite often doing the work of two people, since they can\u2019t afford to be on the sidelines for very long.)\n\nNow more than ever, it\u2019s hard for writers to find the security of being on one show for multiple seasons, even if the show is a major success. This need to bounce around is what the Writers Guild is referring to when they reference the industry becoming a \u201cgig economy.\u201d\n\n- Writers on a staff only get residuals for the specific episodes on which they\u2019re credited as writers; the amount of the residual is determined by their share of the contribution on the final shooting script. \u201cWritten by\u201d means they are credited with the story and script for the specific episode. Smaller shares can be apportioned if you only get \u201cteleplay by\u201d (script) or \u201cstory by\u201d (plot). In addition, multiple writers can be credited on an episode, which reduces the residual further. (If you see an \u201c&amp;\u201d in the credit, that means a team wrote the episode; if you see \u201cand,\u201d that means multiple, separate writers wrote on the project and the credit was split based on the importance of their contributions.) There is also a scenario where a writer can work on an entire season of television, contribute to the plotting, provide notes on every script, rewrite pages or even entire scripts, and yet still not earn a proper script credit, which means they won\u2019t ever be entitled to a residual for the series.",

The source for this information is: https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/wga-contract-inflation-minimums-1235564920/\n\n\"The current guild minimum for a TV writer-producer is $7,412 per week. On a network show, the median writer-producer works between 35-40 weeks, for a total of $259,420 to $296,480, if that writer is paid minimum.\" \n\n\"Schedules are shorter on streaming shows, which produce fewer episodes, according to data released earlier this month by the guild. The median writer-producer on those shows works 20-24 weeks, for a minimum salary range of $148,240 to $177,888.\n\nBut that\u2019s a pay cut from what minimums were during the last negotiation, when factoring in inflation. During the 2019-20 TV season, the guild minimum for a writer-producer was $6,967 per week. In today\u2019s dollars, that would be $8,184, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 CPI calculator.\"\n\n\"At current rates, a writer-producer on most TV shows earns a minimum of $41,773 for each 60-minute script, or $28,403 for each 30-minute script. Those fees would need to increase 11% in order to match the buying power of the script fees in 2019-20.\n\nStaff writers \u2014 the lowest-level writers \u2014 do not get script fees, and they also earn significantly lower weekly minimums. The median staff writer on a network show works 29 weeks for a wage of $131,834, while the median staff writer on a streaming show works 20 weeks for $90,920.\"",

The median staff writer on a network show works 29 weeks for a wage of $131,834, while the median staff writer on a streaming show works 20 weeks for $90,920.\"\n\nFirst of all, between your management team and taxes you can kiss half of that goodbye. They literally tell people that are starting to cut any offer by 50% in your head because that's about how much you're gonna make. \n\nOk, so now your low level writer is making between $45-65k, probably living in either LA or New York, two of the most expensive cities on the planet. But, hey, part of being a struggling writer is the struggling, right? And after all you're learning the ropes and one day might be a high-paid showrunner. \n\nNope, because that path is what the studios are trying to destroy. Writing doesn't stop at the script stage. You re-write on set, in the editting room, etc. And all those skills have to be taught to you by someone more senior. \n\nWhat the studios are doing is trying to take that bit out of the process. Why should they pay some junior for 20 weeks when they could pay them for, say, 8 and then have a more experienced showrunner do all the extra work? \n\nI encourage you to read the entire thing, [but here's an excerpt from GRRM on it](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2023/05/08/writers-on-set/):\n\n&gt;The junior writers?  They\u2019re not there.   Once they delivered their scripts and did a revision of two, they were paid, sent home, their salary ended.   They are off looking for another gig.   If the series gets another season, maybe they will be brought back.   Maybe they won\u2019t.  Maybe they can\u2019t, since they are off in another mini-room for another show.  If they do get brought back, they may get a promotion\u2026 but that\u2019s not guaranteed.   I know writers who have been Staff Writer on half a dozen different series, and others who have been \u201cWriter\u2019s Room Assistant\u201d  (which is the new entry level gig, since no one buys freelance scripts any more) three or four times, never getting off the bottom rung of the ladder so matter how talented they are.   And when a junior writer does finally get a better title, even one that will put a P-word on their IMDB credits,  they still won\u2019t have any producing experience.   In many cases they won\u2019t be asked to set even when the episodes they wrote are being filmed.   (They may be ALLOWED on set, if the showrunner and execs are cool with that, but only as a visitor, with no authority, no role.   And no pay, of course.   They may even be told they are not allowed to speak to the actors).\n\n**TL;DR**: The reason writing is getting worse is literally why they're striking.",

There's not that many of them.\n\nWhen you actually look at writers credits, most of them do very little, sometimes they are credited with one-two episodes a year, and take a long time to find a new show. So it's not just a doctor's job which is guaranteed, it's mostly a gig work where you 120k from the last contract pay for next 2 years of searching for a new job.",

And now the majority of writers get laid off after a show gets picked up and the showrunner has to assume the rest of the responsibilities. One person can't take on that much writing no matter how talented they are.\n\nDo you wonder why the last two seasons of Game of Thrones is so bad? It's a perfect example of how these companies have destroyed writers rooms and hired showrunners with no experience. These two yahoos wrote the last two seasons with a PA and they were complete trash. They admitted later they were way over their heads. A full writers room working on the last two seasons would have done wonders.\n\nOne of the provisions WGA is fighting for are minimum rooms and the opportunity for showrunners to train new people to take over. The WGA *wants* to make better shows for *you*.\n\nSo, if you wonder why quality has gone down, it's not because of the writers. It's because of the networks' trying to undercut writers so shareholders and CEOs can get all the wealth generated.",

Still, I doubt even a full writers room could have cleaned up GRRM's mess (he was adrift story-wise himself) to an acceptable conclusion.\n\nNevertheless, I'll accept your explanation for the drop in quality. That doesn't really change my point though: they're still paying a lot of money and ultimately the writing that gets into a lot of shows lately is just bad. No wonder they're talking about using AI for it, that also won't be great, but it'll be cheaper still. Let's hope it goes the other way and more money is spent on bigger rooms, then.\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not advocating for AI replacing writers!",

At least for now, there will always be a high demand for IT work, so freelancers can get work if they want to.\n\nThe same is not true for creative writers of television shows.\n\nOne of the reasons for this is the shortening of seasons, in part by making individual episodes longer.\n\nAnother problem is that many shows are prematurely cancelled or might never be greenlit.\n\nA specific complaint is that writers are often working on spec or bounce around ideas with other writers without being paid.\n\nWriters can put a lot of unpaid effort into a show that never materializes.\n\nI mentioned the sales part, because that's what writers do.\n\nThey spend a lot of time trying to impress executives with ideas without being paid.\n\nAnd there are many writers who make far less than the average. That is how  averages work.\n\nLastly, some writers only get to work for a few years and rely on residuals to survive until they can switch careers.\n\nI'm getting a bit sick of people only thinking about their specific situation. You are old and will be alright because you worked when demand for IT was high.\n\nA lot of younger people will experience a drastically different IT market.

They should be given that they create a lot of economic value and 2. They should still be paid more because they're being underpaid relative to that generated economic value.

It's a super weird situation. \n\nAs in many things, a fraction of top writers make assloads and then huge swaths can't even count on bringing in enough per year to maintain a career. \n\nWhen they do land a job, it has to pay well, because it won't last long (weeks) and when it's done they're not getting paid for a long time (months, years even) while they scramble to make content and get something going again. \n\nIf they go a year without getting paid anything, that $0 income doesn't count as part of the average. \n\nThey end up doing a LOT of work they don't get paid for: pitches, concepts, outlines, treatments, specs, rewrites, re-rewrites... \n\nThere's a lot more to it, but it amounts to a system where the majority of people can't even do it as a career. I know a WGA member who has written for Disney and lives in a small apartment with 4 roommates. And I know another who did a 4 month re-write with a partner, also for Disney, the exec never read it, the license on the IP ran out, and these guys now have a script they can't do anything with, and they'll never get paid for the work. It's fun. ;)",

They want the minimum wage increased because currently the AMPTP is almost always paying the minimum amount for anybody who isn't a showrunner, that's the only outright wage increase they want. They know the current wage isn't terrible, the problem is that they're being paid less and less because they're being forced to work less weeks and that they're not being paid through production when they should be. They want strong rules in place to stop things from continuing to get worse, because the writing is on the wall that studios will continue to push for less people doing more work in less time unless it's dealt with right now. You're looking at those figures thinking it's a lot, but without strike deals they're going to get lower year after year, not higher or even matching inflation.",

Unfortunately there's no clear answer, [but here's an article that goes into it in more detail.](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/screenwriter-salary-how-much-do-screenwriters-make/) There's also some homebrew surveys [like this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eTBBWgPTZhEEBsnYDUwjZz_qKnvy6uZvd5gJCpfV49s/edit#gid=1828945429a) The average spec sale was around $110,000, but it's fully freelance. So by the time your agent, lawyer, guild, accountant, the IRS and whoever else takes a piece, you're much lower than that.\n\nWhat I can tell you as a screenwriter is that once you get into the guild and a fairly regular series job, or sell a spec you're doing mostly OK for a year or two. However, 'mostly ok' hasn't really kept up with inflation, and the hit to residuals only increases that. Also, staff writer is a really, really hard thing to achieve- it's a bit like saying 'once you make partner, you're doing OK as a lawyer.' Yep, partners are well paid, but there's a lot a law clerks, interns, staff positions (probably a bad analogy, I don't know lawyering that well), plus a decade + of lower wages, and law school.",

This article does say the average is $65K but there is a wide range from $46K in Mississippi to $90K in New York. \n\nHowever it does look like the average starting salary for a teacher in most states from what is stated in this article as well as others is around $32K to 40K so the commenter above is correct in a sense.\n\nAlso speaking as someone whose entire immediate family is made up of teachers they also spend their own money to get school supplies for kids. Heck my dad had a small library in his class for his kids that was at least a few grand of spending his own money. I would say teachers spend close to a thousand at the beginning of every school year to make sure they have the supplies they need. Teachers are grossly underpaid especially in Red states.\n\nhttps://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/the-current-state-of-teacher-pay-in-charts/2023/02",

The streamer sent shock waves through the studio system when it shelled out $100 million (plus ownership stakes) to Rhimes, with the Grey\u2019s Anatomy creator leaving ABC, her home of 15 years, with time remaining on her contract. Six months later, the arms race for TV\u2019s top talent officially kicked into overdrive when Ryan Murphy (American Crime Story) joined Rhimes at Netflix with a record $300 million deal.\n\n\n&gt; **What has emerged is a caste system of sorts, with three distinct tiers of overall deals shaping today\u2019s small-screen economy.**\n\n&gt; The most sought-after writers and producers are also the most versatile \u2014 those who have the ability to juggle multiple series and groom the next generation of showrunners: Fogelman, Jonah Nolan (Westworld), Liz Meriwether (New Girl), and Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The Last Man on Earth) fall into this category. MacFarlane, like Rhimes and Murphy before him, is expected to leave his longtime home at broadcast-focused 20th TV for what sources estimate could be yet another nine-figure deal.\n\n\n&gt; **The second Tier**, which has seen considerable activity and financial growth so far this year, consists of hitmakers who limit their workload to one show at a time. This category includes all-stars like Better Call Saul\u2018s Vince Gilligan (who re-upped with Sony last summer for three years and $50 million) and Levitan. The latter, who has been without a deal since last summer, is expected to remain with longtime exec and travel buddy Dana Walden at Disney\u2019s 20th TV.\n\n\n&gt; **The Third Tier**: The big bucks, however, have not trickled down to the third tier of overalls, which consists of longtime writers fresh off hit shows. This category includes people like Maria Ferrari, who spent a decade on monster hit The Big Bang Theory. Her newly inked three-year, $6 million deal with Warner Bros. is on par with pacts from 20 years ago for writers fresh off of Cheers and ER, as not everyone is able to capitalize on the short supply of proven showrunners amid a higher-than-ever demand for content.\n\n\nGreg Berlanti $400 million (4 years)\n\nRyan Murphy $300 million (5 years)\n\nMike Schur  $125 Million (5 Years)\n\nShonda Rhimes $100 Million (4 years)",

I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca! Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberatin' and conjugatin' the Emancipation Proclamation, does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests.",

The prosecution wanted the trial in LA proper because they believed if they removed it to a \"whiter\" part of the city the public wouldn't see the verdict as legitimate: mistake #1.

The DA's ignorance of their own city's racial dynamics doomed their case before it started.",

Not saying it\u2019s likely he walks- Bill Cosby\u2019s second trial ended very differently. But, there\u2019s always the chance. Running to Malta is basically admitting guilt and I think people would be much less inclined to forgive Weinstein the same way they did Polanski. \n\nCause who cares about drugging and raping a little girl when it was 50 years ago... :\\",

Prove he didn\u2019t. \n\nAnd anyone that gets pissed off at this I\u2019ll just remind them of Casey Anthony. The public and press pushed for that trial and what happened?  She was charged with manslaughter, murder, and child neglect.  They then Gave hr a plea out of the child neglect.  \n\nThe defenses closing argument was:\n\n&gt;\u201dThe burden rests on the shoulders of my colleagues at the state attorney's office,\" \n\nWhich is a fancy way of reminding them about rrasonable doubt.\n\n&gt;\tJose Baez began his closing argument by telling jurors they have more questions than answers, including the biggest: How did Caylee die?\n\nYou see one little statement showed how going in unprepared lost them the entire case.   They charged her with murder, yet couldn\u2019t even tell you how Caylee died, let alone prove who did it. \n\nYou see, regardless of what you think about Casey the truth is we forced the trail and the jury did a good job of finding the correct legal verdict.

(It is, of course, possible that it took place somewhere else.)\n\nNew York statute allows any ***one*** party to a conversation to record it without the knowledge or consent of the other part(ies). \n\n38 of the 50 states are so-called \"one party consent\" states (boy is that a strange phrase to use in the context of this case.) So again, without evidence to the contrary, I have to assume this was a legal recording. If I was asked to put in my own personal opinion about why the recording wasn't used, I'd say it was Weinstein's wealth, power, and public profile.",

No more enforceable than a contract requiring you to do something illegal.\n\nThe problem for people who wanted to say something was that not only were they being intimidated in various ways, but that there was no serious attempt to lay charges against him. So going to the press would, at best, get you embroiled in a civil court battle that you might eventually win after several years. But that in the meantime would take all your resources and probably involve some very sophisticated character-assassination. ",

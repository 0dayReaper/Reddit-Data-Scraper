    "postText": "Call me sappy but I missed Succession already. Maybe it is because this is the one and only Tragedy on TV in a very long time. It feels like it ended badly, not from the story point of view but like it is missing a happy(or happier) ending that it should have. Are we done? You are leaving me just like that? We are not gonna make things work? That's all.",

Honestly, I only want more succession so I can witness Shiv continue to be incompetent with less and less important roles, Roman to finally wind up in a mental health facility, and Kendall just to walk into the East River, never to return.",

No.\n\nThey all walked away impossibly rich after dividing the country and inciting civil war by throwing an election. \n\nA happy ending would see them all in jail.",

Part of why they're so well-written is because for many viewers they have very relatable emotional problems. It's less a show about Billionaires^tm than it is family dynamics and abusive relationships. Doesn't necessarily mean those characters' actions are condoned, though. \n\nI don't think you're much better than the Roys.",

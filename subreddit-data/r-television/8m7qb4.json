I have barely heard of their originals like Bosch, Patriot, Ms Maisel and such and know of no one that watches them. But it's there with their Prime sub which is also taken for plenty of reasons so plenty of people have already access to it. But compare it to Netflix, HBO or even something like CBS All Access, their shows have no buzz at all. Kind of like Hulu btw but even worse. I assume they try to change it small step by small step with their high profile adaptations like Lord of the Rings and the others.\n\nPlus, to be fair, unlike all the other players (well except Apple soon), their business model is quite different, their TV business is not meant to do money but to attract people to their Prime sub and the Amazon ecosystem. I just think that now, it may be more the reverse than the way they want.\n\nBut with The Expanse, their catalogue has just become way more interesting to me. Remains to be seen how it goes internationally (where Netflix had the rights).",

Like I watched half of the first season, and then found out that it was originally produced by SyFy in the US and I was so fucking confused that it came from that shit bag studio.\n\nIt has fairly real physics influenced stuff. Like it's not some Star Trek fake science bullshit where space ships fly around with the fluid dynamics of a submarine and nothing is real or makes any fucking sense. This is a show based on a book series by two authors who publish under one pseudonym. It's kind of a corporate political thriller/noir detective drama kinda thing? It's got moments of camp, and moments where the science isn't quite right, and moments where the space travel happens far too fast ( at least in the show, I haven't read the books) but it's to maintain suspense in scenes where it's kind of necessary. They still manage to capture the expanse of space and the boredom and isolation of crossing large distances with low fuel use.\n\nIt's so fucking cool.\n\nI'm absolutely elated that Bezos saved it. He can work his employees to death as long as he keeps the gold flowing. Only 99% kidding.",

            "comment": "The Expanse is possibly one of the best shows I have ever seen.\n\nI am a 34 year old adult with a lot of responsibilities. I watch a lot of shows with my fiance in the evenings. Grey's Anatomy, the Voice, Dark Matter, and some other shows. Usually I'm doing other stuff like making dinner, cleaning, or doing work while watching my shows. Most of the times, I feel myself waiting for commercials to continue what I was doing.\n\nWhen I watch The Expanse, I feel like a kid again. I get totally sucked into it. I am talking to the characters, something I have never done. The commercials breaks always feel like they come too fast. Other shows I am waiting for commercials. The Expanse, I can't wait for the show to come back on. The show is so tense and unpredictable.\n\nAfter watching TV and movies for decades like most of us Americans, you can see most plots and twists coming a mile away. The Expanse gives me something I have not felt in a long time, a sense of wonder. The show always surprises me. \n\nIt also made me realize how much I was missing a great sci-fi show in my life. I branched out to other shows because of The Expanse. Dark Matter, which is decent, but not spectacular. I feel like it would have done better on a premium channel and allowed for an R rating. It could use some nudity and gore to make up for it's mediocrity, something The Expanse doesn't need, and Altered Carbon, which is an amazing, but sadly very short TV series.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling on. The Expanse is one of the best shows I have watched ever and it makes me feel like a kid again watching it.",

For comparison I offer altered carbon which I really really want to like more, but can't.  The world building is great, some of the characters are great, but holy god the writing is a bag of cliches to the point that my gf and I were having a contest to see who could word for word predict more lines.\n\nThere are cliches.  There are silly resolutions and situations.  They are no where near as bad.  What's SO much better is the world building and the plot actually moving.  One of the upsides of these shows based on books is they have major beats they need to hit so things actually happen.  The plot moves and situations change, and it handles how the world would react very very well.\n\nIt deserves its praise.  Nothing is perfect, and this certainly isn't, but it is still very very good.\n\n",

I hate the absolute lack of science in Star Trek, while it masquerades itself as a science oriented franchise. \n\nI haven't read the books, though a lot of folks say they are better, and I'm guessing some of the flaws in the show have to do with production decisions and choices about TV pacing, and I forgive those minor errors, but for the most part it's very smart, very enjoyable, lots of cool moments.

All I did was work, sleep and watch the expanse, I don't even think I took a single shit. \n\nThis current season is my favourite so far, that tank Mars lady is the shit. That said, I reckon they could have picked a better Holden, that dude is way too depressing for a heroic role, he looks like he cries himself to sleep every night. I suppose that's why people like it - although he goes around doing nothing but heroic shit, the viewer doesn't really see him as a hero.",

Just finished the 1stseason and thank god this was saved, such a cool series with great worldbuilding and characters. Hopefully now with Amazon, they can be a bit more explicit with stuff without being held back by Syfy's restrictions",

No more cheesy commercial cliffhangers, no more PG-13 language, more than 42-minute long episodes, maybe even some tasteful nudity, who knows? All I know is that this is great news.",

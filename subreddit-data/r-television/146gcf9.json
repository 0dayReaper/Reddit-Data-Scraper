    "postText": "The culmination of every single relationship and plot point of the entire season, along with some of the funniest jokes of the season.  The amazing hockey scene set to a haunting love song.  \n\nThe hook of the next seasons storyline, along with the emblematic last scene of shoresy and the team finally doing some exerhcise. Implying the growth into actually caring about the game as well as the promise of expanding the world moving outside of the rink and bars we've been in all season and into the streets where we've never been before.  \n\nIt makes me want to restart the season again every single time, not wanting to be away from these characters we've grown to love.",

    "postText": "I was thinking about how some shows run for long enough that their \"look\" changes as they go on, which can be fun to notice if you binge them afterwards. The biggest example I could think of is Curb Your Enthusiasm, which started in 4:3 SD quality with very cheap and natural lighting, and has now turned into a very modern looking comedy after 20 years. To a lesser extent, something like Game of Thrones also ran long enough that the later seasons had more slick, modern color grading than the first few (with of course bigger CGI sequences). On the other hand, shows like Friends can run for 10 years while still being mostly visually the same.\n\nWhat are some other interesting examples of this? Could also be shows where a big/gradual change in visuals was a creative choice.",

One of the most notable for me was when they shifted from static tracking shots to actually being able to follow the actors. Another great one is when you can *tell* they created a brand-new special effect for an episode. I just get all kinds of goofy whenever i think of the process involved in that, just so they can show the doctor having a grand adventure",

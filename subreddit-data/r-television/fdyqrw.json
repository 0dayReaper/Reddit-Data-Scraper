They believed that he should have allowed the fireflies to take out Ellie's brain to save what was left of humanity. They saw that he was selfish and saved her because she reminded him of Sarah. That may be true, but I would have done the same thing if given that circumstance. She just saved his life, and they risked going through hell to save each other, and suddenly he's supposed to sit and take it, allow them to kill her for the greater good?. I was with Joel and gladly started popping shots at those fools!.",

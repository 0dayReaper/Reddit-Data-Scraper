We actually care more about the union then A-listers because we need the protections that union provides *more*, not less.\n\nThe vast majority of independent films, union.

However, I don't believe this will provide the concessions the writers need. The fundamental model of how the WGA works is structured around individual productions (as is that of the studios). However, the studios will ultimately have to license those productions to the streaming services - and that licensing will invariably be a package deal.\n\nMoreover, the comparative scale of the companies also comes into play. The studios are faced with the same sort of dilemma the WGA dealing with the streaming services - the services are massive global corporations while the studios are still local companies.\n\n&gt; This is like saying \"mining ore is no longer important to the manufacturing of steel.\"\n\nYou might look at how well coal miners (and their union) are doing these days.",

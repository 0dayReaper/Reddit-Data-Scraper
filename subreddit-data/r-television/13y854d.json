Besides the writers strike, a lot of them seem super busy.\n\n* Joel McHale has his own show (picked up for a 2nd season)\n* Donald Glover is always super busy on different projects (TV, movie, on stage, music)\n* Danny Pudi has a large role on *Mythic Quest* and does some other stuff\n* Alison Brie is a pretty large star at this point and seems to be constantly working\n* Gillian Jacobs just had a miniseries she starred in as well as a movie she starred in and likely has other similar stuff coming out (writer's strike aside)\n* Yvette Nicole Brown always pops up in all sorts of things\n* Ken Jeong is all over the place doing things and has a 3rd season of his game show coming out\n\nI'm sure they'd all like to make time and will try to find a way, but it seems wild to say they're not up to much right now (unless you just mean because of the writer's strike).",

Nearly every single attempt a reboot or continuation in the past decade has been pretty poorly received. There are exceptions but they\u2019re very rare. Add to that the legendary anticipation of this particular movie for this particular series and it\u2019s a recipe for a let down.\n\nI would expect the ultimate fan reaction to be mild disappointment framed positively along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s not quite what I expected but man it feels so good to have these characters back and go for one last ride!\u201d - I say that because that\u2019s been the refrain for most of these attempts. Then you give it a little time and people finally feel comfortable admitting that it really wasn\u2019t so great.\n\nArrested Development is probably a good parallel for how I would expect this to go. Season 4 came out only 7 years after the show originally ended and the fan reaction was either immediate distaste or more commonly this tepid \u201cWell yeah, it\u2019s different. But different is good and by the time you get to the end it really feels like the show!\u201d Fast forward about six months later and the consensus largely becomes that it was pretty bad and definitely disappointing. This same pattern occurred with the following Season 5 which came out a few years later except the turnaround on accepting that it wasn\u2019t very good was that much faster. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard to capture lightning in a bottle. There\u2019s just too much creative synergy that goes into making a great television series. It\u2019s a combination of tons of factors: the actors and their chemistry, the writers and their chemistry, the culture of the time it is airing in, the passion of the people involved and where they are in their lives. \n\nIt becomes harder and harder to make all of that work again as time passes. People move on, their relationships change, their lives and perspectives change, society changes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s insignificant to note that Community has now been off the air longer than it was on.",

Community is a whole different wierd thing. They could make the whole movie a remake of the Princess Bride just with community characters and fans would still be happy, they're a bit like South Park in that their world is so flexible there's not many limits on what they can do.",

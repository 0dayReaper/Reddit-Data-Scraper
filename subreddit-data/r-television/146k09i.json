The only thing observed was the audio of a couple seconds of some screams of terror emanating from Vandelay and a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it shot of a gleeful sociopathic postal worker who served as Kramer\u2019s cohost reacting before the credits rolled over the feminine shrieks of the short, stocky, bald marine biologist who apparently slept through all the zoology classes that focused on the animals that spend their lives on land or in the air.",

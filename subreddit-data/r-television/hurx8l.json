            "comment": "CW: Sexual Assualt\n\nthanks to u/CMelody for linking the full complaint.\n\nI'm worried more people won't read it, so here's a good excerpt from it just to show how bad the allegations are:\n\n&gt;On June 25, 2020, Ms. Eckhart, through counsel, put Fox News on notice that she retained legal counsel in connection with legal claims against Mr. Henry and Fox News.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Henry, approximately twice Ms. Eckhart\u2019s age, preyed upon, manipulatedv and groomed Ms. Eckhart starting at the young age of 24, by exerting his abuse of power over her and her career. Mr. Henry not only leveraged this imbalance of power for control over his victim, Ms. Eckhart, but asked her to be his \u201csex slave\u201d and his \u201clittle whore,\u201d and threatened punishment and retaliation if Ms. Eckhart did not comply with his sexual demands.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ms. Eckhart\u2019s counsel described to Fox News, in graphic and specific detail, how Mr. Henry groomed, psychologically manipulated and coerced Ms. Eckhart into having a sexual relationship with him, and that, when she would not comply voluntarily, he sexually assaulted her on office property, and raped her at a hotel where Fox News frequently lodged its visiting employees, thereby facilitating, whether knowingly or unknowingly, Mr. Henry\u2019s conduct.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ms. Eckhart\u2019s counsel also explained to Fox News, in graphic and specific detail, that Ms. Eckhart was violently raped while helpless and restrained in metal handcuffs, as Mr. Henry preformed sadistic acts on her without her consent that left her injured, bruised and battered with bloody wrists.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prior to violently assaulting Ms. Eckhart, Mr. Henry took photos of Ms. Eckhart on his iPhone while laughing, as Ms. Eckhart pleaded with Mr. Henry to stop, and to remove the handcuffs, and to delete the naked pictures he took of her without her consent. Ms. Eckhart believes that Mr. Henry used those photos he took of her while naked, helpless and restrained in handcuffs as an intimidation tactic to silence her, and to be filed away and retained for purposes of blackmail that could destroy her career.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To be clear, Ms. Eckhart did not consent to any part of this violent, painful rape. The day after this rape, Ms. Eckhart told Mr. Henry in writing that he had physically injured her. Ms. Eckhart told him that she had sore wrists (they were actually bleeding), a mark on her buttocks, a broken nail and a bruise on her leg, among other injuries. Ms. Eckhart\u2019s counsel shared this information with Fox News.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ms. Eckhart\u2019s counsel also shared with Fox News the existence of certain text messages that establish Mr. Henry\u2019s delusions and prove his violence",

On that day, Mr. Hannity, on set and in front of the entire studio crew \u2013 and completely unsolicited \u2013 threw $100 on the set desk. He then began calling out to the men in the room and demanding that someone take Ms. Areu out on a date for drinks at Del Friscos. He repeatedly Case 1:20-cv-05593 Document 1 Filed 07/20/20 Page 7 of 39 Deadline 8 yelled, \u201cwho wants to take her on a date?\u201d \u201cTake her on a date to Del Friscos.\u201d Ms. Areu was completely mortified and made clear that she was incredibly uncomfortable with Mr. Hannity\u2019s misogynistic behavior by quietly pleading with one of her friends in the room to accept the money so that the humiliation would end. 25. To make matters worse, Ms. Areu was \u201cstuck\u201d and could not even leave because Mr. Hannity engaged in this conduct while she was \u201chooked into\u201d studio equipment that could only have been removed by a stagehand. 26. Thankfully, none of the staff cooperated with Mr. Hannity, even after he repeatedly chided one particular male employee for being \u201cafraid to take out a beautiful woman.\u201d    \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Following the show, Mr. Carlson, hardly making any effort to hide his intentions, began telling Ms. Areu that he would be alone in New York City that night, and specifically said that he would be staying alone in his hotel room without any wife or kids. 34. Without question, Mr. Carlson was probing to see whether Ms. Areu was interested in a sexual relationship. Ms. Areu awkwardly sidestepped Mr. Carlson\u2019s advances and declined to spend the night at his hotel. Mr. Carlson promptly retaliated against Ms. Areu, who was featured on his show only three times in 2019 and has not appeared once in 2020.",

The way they're wording it in the article makes it sound like they're trying to go the pedo route, when the victim was in her mid-20's at the *start* of it.

An incredible amount of trust is involved and safe words and boundaries are put in place in a healthy BDSM experience.\n\nThis, on the other hand, is the definition of forced imprisonment, sexual assault and rape.  Even if Ms. Eckhart originally consented in the sphere of BDSM play, she has the right to revoke that consent and stop at any time.  If this is not respected, and if the actions are continued with an unwilling participant, it is no longer BDSM play but rape/sexual assault.\n\nIt's shit like this that causes so much judgement and misunderstanding of the BDSM community.",

On that day, Mr. Hannity, on set and in front of the entire studio crew \u2013 and completely unsolicited \u2013 threw $100 on the set desk. He then began calling out to the men in the room and demanding that someone take Ms. Areu out on a date for drinks at Del Friscos. He repeatedly Case 1:20-cv-05593 Document 1 Filed 07/20/20 Page 7 of 39 Deadline 8 yelled, \u201cwho wants to take her on a date?\u201d \u201cTake her on a date to Del Friscos.\u201d Ms. Areu was completely mortified and made clear that she was incredibly uncomfortable with Mr. Hannity\u2019s misogynistic behavior by quietly pleading with one of her friends in the room to accept the money so that the humiliation would end. 25. To make matters worse, Ms. Areu was \u201cstuck\u201d and could not even leave because Mr. Hannity engaged in this conduct while she was \u201chooked into\u201d studio equipment that could only have been removed by a stagehand. 26. Thankfully, none of the staff cooperated with Mr. Hannity, even after he repeatedly chided one particular male employee for being \u201cafraid to take out a beautiful woman.\u201d    \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Following the show, Mr. Carlson, hardly making any effort to hide his intentions, began telling Ms. Areu that he would be alone in New York City that night, and specifically said that he would be staying alone in his hotel room without any wife or kids. 34. Without question, Mr. Carlson was probing to see whether Ms. Areu was interested in a sexual relationship. Ms. Areu awkwardly sidestepped Mr. Carlson\u2019s advances and declined to spend the night at his hotel. Mr. Carlson promptly retaliated against Ms. Areu, who was featured on his show only three times in 2019 and has not appeared once in 2020.",

The shit about Ed Henry in this article... this dude is legitimately fucking deranged.\n\nIt makes me fucking sick that this dude hosted a morning show on Fox and was able to convince America that he was a good dude. I remember after the scandal with him fucking Vegas strippers behind his wife's back in 2016, how he just resumed hosting after four months like nothing had happened... I was looking at him like \"this dude fucked strippers\"... but then there was also a whole nother layer to it I didn't even know. This dude needs to be put away.\n\n&gt; Later that day, Mr. Henry demanded that Ms. Eckhart meet him in one of the Guest Offices on the 17th floor of the Fox News building. When Ms. Eckhart arrived at the room, Mr. Henry was on the phone.  Ms. Eckhart repeatedly indicated that she had to leave because a car was waiting for her outside to take her \nand Ms. Claman to the New York Stock Exchange for a live broadcast. Rather than letting Ms. Eckhart leave, Mr. Henry got off of the phone and pinned Ms. Eckhart to the wall inside the Guest Office.  He began subjecting her to forceful and unwanted kissing.  He then quickly unzipped his pants, and physically used his hand to force Ms. Eckhart\u2019s head down to his penis. While forcefully moving Ms. Eckhart\u2019s head back and forth, Mr. Henry physically forced her to perform oral sex on him.  After Mr. Henry came, Ms. Eckhart immediately ran out of the office in a state of shock, panic and fear. Although Ms. Eckhart was able to avoid seeing Mr. Henry after the September 2015 sexual assault on office property, he continued to send her lewd and graphic sexual messages. In one message to Ms. Eckhart he wrote, \u201cI\u2019d like to wipe you with my tongue.\u201d\n\nJust one of the MANY Ed Henry stories in this report. Not even the worst of them.",

And then you have the fact that these jobs are relatively exclusive\\hard to come by, and for a newcomer getting a big break is hard enough on its own, getting a second opportunity even moreso. This makes it different from the Dominoes example in that you can always go get a different service industry job.\n\nThis creates a power dynamic that is rife for abuse. You have a powerful, untouchable figure with young, inexperienced employees who have to fear for their very careers, not just at that company but anywhere, fearful that if they don't just go along with what the powerful figure wants, their life will be ruined.

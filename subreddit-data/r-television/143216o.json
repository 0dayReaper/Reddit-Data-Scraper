(And the ending didn't wave away anything, except for the perceived direction of the flash-sideways storyline.)\n\nManifest has almost nothing in common with Lost. It's more like The Event from years back. Lots of random mysteries that are loosely connected to one another, but the explanations are never really that satisfying, and the characters are never particularly interesting.",

It can be addicting but it is not a good series imo",

I'm not sure about Lost because I haven't seen it but I feel like Manifest wasn't the show that I expected when I started watching it. I thought it was a mystery sci-fi show similar to a Stephen King book but it has significant religious themes. I'm not sure if Lost does too. For viewers who aren't familiar with the Bible some of the themes such as the part about Noahs arc might be difficult to understand.",

It is, however, a nice wrap-up to the story, within the context of the show. \n\nUnlike Lost which...man, I'm glad I did in the era of binge-watching b/c if I'd waited week to week to find that steaming sack of bovine metabolic by-product in a finale...yeah, best not to think about that.\n\nEdit: Heh, apparently you're not allowed to point out that the ending of Lost was a steaming sack of bovine metabolic by-product.",

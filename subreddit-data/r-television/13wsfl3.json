The consistent exploration of Cruz and Mansell wanting to be cowboys and the subtle examination of masculinity will play really well with Raylan. Justified is one of my five favorite shows of all time and I'm just so happy to have Raylan back in my life, even if it's only for a little while.",

It is pretty smart and aware and just because it doesn't hit your face with political points doesn't make it a lesser show. In fact, it has one of the best depictions of coal country capitalism and politics of Appalachia",

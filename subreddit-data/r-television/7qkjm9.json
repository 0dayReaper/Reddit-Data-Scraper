Myth Busters and Dirty Jobs were great shows but perhaps they started the flood of realty type programming?",

Maybe throw in some re-enactment scenes which are always done for cheap usually with novice actors trying to get any job they can.\n\nI'd imagine it's because these shows bring in more viewers and ad revenue, not because they're cheaper to make. There are history grad students that make decent history documentaries on YouTube for free. Dan Carlin was doing some of the best work ever (granted it was just audio and not video) on a shoestring budget when he first started his podcast. He still does it incredibly cheap comparatively.",

But the lone survivor was in \"prison\" for cannibalizing the people that died. They found \"undiscovered\" tapes, interviewed the guy in an Indonesian prison. Showed newspaper clippings. It wasn't all that unbelievable. An undiscovered primate species deep in the Indonesian jungle in the 70's. Then they showed the \"new found footage\" his sister had found with his personal effects. And I just stopped and thought \"You gotta be fucking kidding me\". It was little midget people chasing them down and killing them. I flipped the channel like I had just stumbled on gay porn. Still feel like a fucking idiot for thinking it was real for the first half hour or whatever",

Is a bad way to go, the DGA got a deal with everything except that. I support the writers,  just need to give in on one point. If its about healthcare, thay should be a separate point and honestly is a problem for all of us. We need single payer healthcare , still 20 writers for 20 episodes,  its not going to fly and is uneeded.",

The share register will feature names such as BlackRock, Fidelity, State Street, and Vanguard. **But those are just fiduciary institutions that invest on behalf of the real shareholders**. The same holds for pension funds such as CalPERS, New York State Common Retirement Fund, and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and for the activist investors Pershing Square, Third Point, and ValueAct Capital. Collectively, these institutions represent 80% of supposed shareholders. The actual shareholders have no conversation with the companies they own, and may not even know they own them.\"\n\nRight, they represent shareholders. It is not saying the shares are owned by the companies.\n\n&gt;This provides evidence of horizontal ownership issues\n\n\"Institutional investors have grown so much because they **offer small-scale savers the opportunity to invest in diversified funds** with economies of scale.\"\n\nSame as the above.

Investing in a company to make it a part of a product you sell is not the same as investing in a company due to interest in that company performing well/.\n\n&gt;And my point lends support to why the Comcast CEO got the votes for the pay from their institutional investors.\n\nIn your first link,\n\n\"One might assume that large institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, State Street, and the big pension funds have so much capital that they can force executives to act in the interests of their clients. Although some are attempting this, their ability to do so is limited, because the large funds are so big that each of them has ownership in most of the market. That means two things: First, the big institutions can go only so far in punishing any one company, because if they sell out, depressing the share price, they will simply provide an opportunity for a leveraged buyout or an activist hedge fund. Second, big, diversified funds have no incentive to see any one company do particularly well, because they own all its competitors; any outstanding success on the part of one company will come at the expense of its rivals and their stock prices. One might think that an institutional shareholder of Kimberly-Clark would like to see the company come up with a fantastic innovation that enabled its Huggies disposable diapers to crush P&amp;G\u2019s Pampers. But because it\u2019s likely to hold as big a position in P&amp;G as it does in Kimberly-Clark, its gains on the latter\u2019s stock would probably be offset by its losses on P&amp;G stock.\n\nThe bottom line is that institutional investors have neither the ability nor the incentive to discipline executives, protect companies against rapacious hedge funds, or even encourage companies to compete aggressively.\"",

Revenue from content licensing (8.7B) and home entertainment (1.3B) makes up the bulk of their revenue from the film studio segment.\n\nTheme parks brought $7.5B.\n\nBroadcast advertising brought in $10B and distribution 10.8B. These are obviously much more sensitive to the writer strike - if NBC has to run old programs, these numbers will likely go down, but they also include reruns, sports and news, which are unaffected.\n\nSo over all only $22.4B of NBCUniversal\u2019s $39.B revenue (~57%) even comes from anything that touches writers, and much of that is from reruns, sports and news which needs to be excluded.\n\nThat $22.4B is only 18.5% of Comcast\u2019s $121.4B total revenue - again still including reruns, sports, and news.",

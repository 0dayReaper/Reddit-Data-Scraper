    "postText": "Im a huge euphoria fan. Loved the 2nd season, although the 1st season was better the 2nd is good too. I watched the first episode to try it out, and I was actually excited for it. Then when i watched it it had like no flavour, no plot, I didnt like it at all. And this is coming from someone who loves every show people hate- like this was genuinely bad. Pretty sure the 2nd episode came out but this is the first time Im actually gonna stop and not continue. Its so bad, and the main character is such a dumbass, I really dont know how to describe it except its so bad. Its so gross, especially the romantcization of r\\*pe.\n\nThe accurate reviews are \"torture porn\" and \"grim, gross, and vulgar.\" The behind-the-scenes filming for the show was described as something that went \"wildly, disgustingly off the rails.\" The show's initial approach was to explore the seedy underbelly of Hollywood and the music industry, but it became what it tried to satirize. The show's main character, Jocelyn, is largely inactive and one-dimensional, and Depp does little to animate the part. The show goes out of its way to insist on Jocelyn's skimpy wardrobe and hypersexuality, but it is not the issue here. The Idol shows glimmers of potential when it comes to addressing the toxic entertainment industry, but it does so at the expense of its main character. The show ultimately becomes regressive, and it is not cool, nor is it subversive. It is a hopeless try-hard, and worse, it's painfully dull. The Idol has been accused of crossing the line between provocative storytelling and gratuitous depictions of sex and violence. The series reportedly contains scenes that some viewers have found disturbing, with an emphasis on sexual content and nudity. \r  \n\n\nIt makes me believe lily rose depp acts like this in real life, which I dont think is too far from the truth. She was already unlikable and seemed like a mean girl to me. Also why did they do maddy so wrong from euphoria? shes my favorite tv character of all time, and the horrendous wig and ugly thin eyebrows did her so wrong. Idk, like what was the point of that? shes a teen or young adult (19-20) partying with p\\*rn stars. ",

And I never say this about shows, as much as people criticize and watch, characters are monotone. I mean when she said mental illness is sexy, this is just a trip back to the Heroin Chic era.",

Euphoria was way worse when it comes to explicit and vulgar content. Quote: The behind-the-scenes filming for the show was described as something that went \"wildly, disgustingly off the rails. And this whole opinion is based on article of one man from Rolling Stones, nobody verified if it is true or not.",

This series is not good, lily's character is very monotone and one sided. instead of it showing the dark side of hollywood and how its SUPPOSED to be looked at as bad, at least from a womans point of view, its showing how women would almost like this, when we dont. Pretty sure sam had this in mind or so I heard from other creditable critics.",

I feel like HBO has become a bit more mainstream since HBO Max launched and especially since WB and Discovery merged, people are forgetting that HBO is supposed to be edgy and scandalous. That\u2019s how they made their name and put their originals on the map. I don\u2019t love that young teens are the main target (not sure if they were initially intended that way but many of them are watching and learning, however in this day and age it\u2019s very easy to access mature content on your own, I would not blame the network) for some of the newer shows but I didn\u2019t think the show was crossing a line or anything. To me it was just an old school CW show with a more sex and cursing lol",

The pushing of certain celebs would explain that. (coughs jennie coughs the weeknd promoting to his very much young fanbase of 14 year olds coughs LRD to pinterest obsessed 12 year olds) Look, euphoria was talking about drugs and stuff. But it wasnt like woah, drugs are cool. It was more like drugs are fucked up, hence the consquences rue got herself in to. Here it shows the exploitation of women, and how they are being used and rape. But it says, rape cigarettes and excessive nudity is cool, hence \"He's kind of rapey and I like that\" Or how mental illnesses is cool and further pushes the agenda of eating disorders to teens wanting to have it. \"Mental illness is sexy.\"",

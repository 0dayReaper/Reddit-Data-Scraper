The second season improves on what came first, but is still pretty divisive because of one of the main characters that season. The third season is pretty damn great, although I know some folks don't like Thick-Neck Smits.\n\nThe fourth season is widely accepted as the show's absolute peak quality-wise, with everything clicking and coming together in an absolutely fantastic way. It's one of my favorite single seasons of any show ever. Not quite up there with Seasons 4 of The Wire, but not far from the first season of True Detective. That's high praise.\n\nBut then. Holy shit, dude. Imagine everything you love about your favorite show, but only now imagine that someone has taken control of that show and is purposely mutating those very qualities into something that isn't parody or deconstruction; you don't know what the fuck it is they're doing to the show, because some of the same characteristics you liked about it are still there, but they've changed somehow. It's like your show died, was buried in the Pet Semetery, and came back like this. It's something different, and you can't quite figure out *why* it's so awful and different, because *somewhere* in there, that show you loved still peaks through the mountains of shit and every godfuckingawful TV trope you can imagine.\n\nAnd maybe you think it gets better, that this particular season was a misstep and the show will course-correct. But you're wrong. Because whatever demon runs the show now has discovered some way to make *each subsequent season* even worse than the last. It's admirable that they were able to turn it into such drivel.",

He kept writing to police and the news because he wasn't getting enough attention for his crimes. He wrote poetry about crimes he committed. He later became a dog catcher and reveled in killing dogs.\n\nHe is a piece of shit.\n\nDefinitely check out the last podcast on the left for their episodes on him and other big serial killers (ed kemper and jerry brudos- both featured in the show).",

Tench deals with strange on a daily basis. \n\n* He struggles with the depravity of his job.\n\n* He struggles with his inability to convince others to open up to strange\n\n* He struggles with his awareness of his inadequacy at home. \n\n* He struggles with his inability to reconcile his learned behaviours of self preservation as an FBI agent who asks himself to many questions, and his inability to completely disagree with his co-workers. \n\nTench is not the normal center of the show. Tench is safety, and the cost of safety. Tench is the shows best non serial killer character. \n\n",

I think the director REALLY nailed the drab 1960/1970 middle America feel and look of the road. \n\nThe characters are all very deep and unique. Their issues out of their work influence how they work, they make decisions with lasting effects...\n\nAnd the guy who plays Kemper. Oh my god. Such a good performance.

On one occasion, when Douglas' colleague Robert Ressler was in a cell alone with Kemper, Kemper\u2014who at the time weighed 300 pounds (136 kg)\u2014noticed the apprehension in Ressler after he had pressed a hidden button repeatedly to call a guard to open the cell yet not received a response and told him \"Relax. They're changing the shift,\" but remarked: \"If I went apeshit in here, you'd be in a lot of trouble, wouldn't you? I could screw your head off and place it on the table to greet the guard.\"[71] Ressler verbally sparred with Kemper until the guard arrived, ultimately leaving unharmed with Kemper displaying no physical aggression. Kemper also stated afterwards that he was joking, but Ressler never entered a cell alone again with Kemper and it became FBI policy to interview serial killers in pairs.[72]",

Its also way more technical of a show with exceptional detail into case work.  \n\nIt also has one of the best single episodes in television history.  Those who have seen the show probably know which episode(ted's story). Id say overall its better than mindhunter as a show.",

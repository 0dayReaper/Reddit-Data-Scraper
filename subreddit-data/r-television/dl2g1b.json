It reminds me of the recent HK/China scandal with the NBA and Blizzard. These are both companies whose products are \"heroes.\" The NBA markets players to be bigger than life. They create their own heroes of \"dreams, inspiration, determination, and hope.\"  Blizzard tells stories about heroes, \"doing the right thing, fighting against oppression and fighting for freedom,\" all while each bow to the iron fist of totalitarianism.\n\nIts an ironic relationship; greed and Jesus creating the illusion of higher morality.",

                                    "comment": "Over been saying this for a while; the Marvel movies are perfect B movies for the family. Doing a perfect B movie for a family is actually kind of hard and the reason Marvel is printing money is cause it found a formula that works and just keeps repeating it. Just enough adult humor, not too scary villains, nostalgia galore, and except for like 3 movies (ironically their best ones) very little thematic explorations. Oh and heart. So much fucking heart. \n\nThe Boys was something the 1980s comic writers eventually had to do - adult exploration of b movie premises. Jesus \"V for Vendetta\" was an anarchist response to a fascist Thatcher who secretly sponsored right wing terror groups in Northern Ireland and broke Miners unions - Alan Moore literally said the book was an exploration of when political violence against a corrupt government is ok. That's a b movie setup - rebel against evil governement. (He also takes a similar stance as the anarcho-syndacalist Albert Camus that it's ok as long as you expect to die and don't expect to see the future that your violence will create - he calls this not moral but ethical. Camus calls this \"the fastidious assassin.\" It's also, as Camus was a leftist, should come from the Left; the book is called \"The Rebel\" and arguably won him the Nobel Prize. Oh and he attacked the USSR from the Left for their violence, like Orwell).\n\nWatchmen (comic) was the adult realization that people without oversight and massive powers would most definitely abuse those powers. Even against each other Jesus the Comedian rapes Silk Spectre *because he can. If no one's around, who's gonna stop him?* (This is also the basis of anarchist thought btw - no oversight will always produce abuse of power).\n\nAfter a decade of perfect b movie for the family I think people are ready for a show like The Boys, which drew as a comic and a show on the history of drawing heavy thematic explorations of childish fantasies. It shows how in our society, in real life, which commodifies everything, superheros would be incorporated. They would be a product to be auctioned off for cities. Crimes staged for the camera would be the norm. Creating enemies to ensure profit is just a natural extension of our economic system. \"The economy informs the culture\".\n\nedit: quaderrordemonstand is right, Thatcher didn't influence the *conception* of the book. I'm mis-remembered what Moore said in Introduction to V for Vendetta which is as follows; \"It's 1988 now. Margaret Thatcher is entering her third term of office and talking confidently of an unbroken Conservative leadership well into the next century. My youngest daughter is seven and the tabloid press are circulating the idea of concentration camps for persons with AIDS. The new riot police wear black visors, as do their horses, and their vans have rotating video cameras mounted on top. The government has expressed a desire to eradicate homosexuality, even as an abstract concept, and one can only speculate as to which minority will be the next legislated against. I'm thinking of taking my family and getting out of this country soon, some time over the next couple years. It's cold and it's mean-spirited and I don't like it here anymore. Goodnight England. Goodnight Home Service and V for Victory. Hello the voice of Fate and V FOR VENDETTA.\" - Alan Moore.",

He clearly isn\u2019t as powerful as he would be if they kept the twist the same, otherwise he would have punted the Female into orbit, but he actually takes some damage in the fight. Also, the actor portraying him is black and I don\u2019t think the show runners have any plans of switching the actor. I think Homelander\u2019s son will fulfill a lot of the plot points Black Noir did in the comics.",

Superman's laser vision provides a horrible, agonizing death as your entrails slip out of your torso. Batman's wrist blades eviscerate you, etc. I can't stand torture-porn type movies like Saw or Hostel but seeing the more realistic application of superhero abilities is really fun.",

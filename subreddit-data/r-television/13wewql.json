    "postText": "Elementary (2012\u20132019)\n\nWhat do you think about this show? What do you think about this adaptation of Sherlock Holmes character?\n\nPersonally, I liked this show, I enjoyed the plot of the cases and solving it, the cast and the acting were good, especially Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, I also liked their chemistry, and I liked that the show remained well to the end without the two main characters becoming a couple which seems like something unique that doesn't happen very often.\n\nWhat about you?",

Unlike other shows...",

I came to the series after it was over and was mostly bored with Holmes/Watson retellings and reimaginings. I was definitely wary. But the show nailed it. They set up an interesting dynamic and made it work within the framework of the series.  \n\nThe chemistry between the lead characters was excellent. They really became a solid team. In spite and because of the oddness that was a solid part of the series. \n\nDefinitely has strong rewatch potential too. Even if you know the solution to the various crimes",

Joe is a *wonderful* person, so is Ingeborg -- but he and his wife are a little homely and so were their two younger children. Their eldest daughter was *pretty*. I never consciously noticed that, but as all our kids were running around having fun and we were enjoying watching them, apropos of nothing I blurted:\n\n&gt; At least Susan [the eldest] *looks like she is your kid.*\n\nimplying that Susan was *not* their child.\n\n*What an asshole.* :(\n\nMy comment surprised me. \n\nI glanced at them and both Joe and Ingeborg were both looking down at their laps, embarrassed or ashamed, avoiding eye contact.\n\nI can be a real shit sometimes. *That* time was 100% unpremeditated: my brain made an inference *without telling me* and I just blurted it out, without even being aware of it.\n\nThat's what I remember (shudder) when Sherlock makes that third inference.\n\nJoe and Ingeborg and I are still friends.",

Plus Jonny showing more physical autistic traits, after sociologists diagnosed the character as being on the spectrum years ago. As someone with high-functioning autism like Miller's version, it really helped to show him both struggle and use it as a strength compared to the lesser version that the BBC had.",

Especially impressive that the show churned out up to 24 episodes a season for 7 seasons and managed to have almost no duds in my opinion.\n\nI worried that the show would hit a point where they either ran out of ideas for these cases and it started getting repetitive and boring, or the cases got sidelined in favour of unrelated storylines (as much as I enjoyed shows like Lucifer and iZombie, I often thought \"why even bother inserting a case of the week into this episode if you're only going to dedicate 10 minutes to it\"), but it never happened - Elementary stuck to its formula and somehow stayed consistently good",

Outside of that though, Lucy Liu did a great job at updating the character, and especially in a way that didn't make Watson just a passive audience surrogate for 7 seasons, so I can appreciate why they did it.",

I found Harris *likable*, though, where Scott was *repellant*, really delivering that psychopath vibe.\n\nIf you haven't watched [Foyle's War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310455/?ref_=tt_ov_inf), I really recommend it.

She is different yet equal to Sherlock, and not just submissive.\n\nThe storyline were, mostly, smart and the show didn't overstay its welcome.\n\nIn the end, they didn't force the two main characters together, showing an unexpected maturity: not every couple needs to be romantically involved.",

It deviates from the source only in that it tries to ground the characters a bit more in real life (less fantastical approach), which works in favor of it as a whole though kind of gives a different spin than the original. The show has been pretty consistent with its characters throughout its span which is laudable. Also the character of Watson is at least as well developed as Sherlock which is a joy to watch and makes it less lead centric than for example House or the BBC Sherlock. Also comparing with House (which I love equally, both series are my top procedural probably) I always felt that Elementary did much better on following up on the theme of a struggling genius and its implications on their life instead of just presenting it (House kind of stagnated in that sense).  But mostly it is a love letter to the original canon and just hearing the creators talk about wanting to pay homage is so great and it really shows throughout the series imo.\n\nCurrently doing a rewatch and it holds up susprisingly well and does  not feel dated at all (perhaps also due to strong female characters) and just a really fun viewing experience",

I very quickly stopped thinking of it as an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes and more of it's own thing which took the basic premise and character personalities and asked 'What would this look like in real life?' and then ran with it.\n\nMore than any other adaptation of Sherlock Holmes I've seen, this had heart.  It had believable character growth and motivation and flaws.  The cases were interesting and mostly well-developed but never at the expense of who these people were.   People called Sherlock out on his shit rather than just being in awe of his deductions or being fools.   It is ultimately just a beautiful, beautiful show and the leads brought everything to these characters.\n\nYou named a Bee after me.   Who could ask for more?",

Watson grew into her own and stood as an equal to Sherlock and the two have the most heartwarming relationship I've ever seen. They're completely (and platonically) in love with each other.\n\nAnd they took the time of day to flesh out what a modern version of Sherlock Holmes would look like instead of doing a half-ass job and thumbing their nose at the source material (looking at you BBC Sherlock) is amazing. Not all of the seasons are top-tier (Season 5) but it's still better than a lot of the stuff on tv now.\n\nSorry, it's one of my favorite shows and I will talk at length about it given the chance.",

IMO the only misstep was CBS pouring dump trucks of cash on the showrunner's lawns until they agreed to come back for that final season - it would've been better with the original series finale.

I'm still on the 1st season but the scene where Sherlock tells Watson that she's the reason why he's in such a good place now (or something like that), I was literally squealing. I don't even ship them, I just love their connection. Also think it was an absolutely brilliant decision to make Sherlock a recovering addict.

I hold that the entire premise of Sherlock being in recovery misses the point of who Sherlock really is. Sherlock was self-involved and left the people close to him (mostly Wilson) catch the fallout. The only reason he got away with it is because he was so good at his job. \n\nThis version of Sherlock was all the upside without the downside. He was an amazing detective AND trying to be a better person. This stripped away a lot of the ethos of who Sherlock is and turned him into a different character IMO. \n\nI cant remember exactly how much of Elementary I watched. I think about 2 seasons. So my opinion is obviously made on limited information.",

The producer would have no reason to do it and it ended up wasting years of his life. Nothing Carole could offer him would be worth more than that footage. Carole lost valuable evidence she needed for the lawsuit. The only person who didnt lose something that couldn't be replaced by the misguided charity of others is Joe.",

We need to have people working to buy into that, so that we can keep that flush for our future,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe other reason is to have people learn and see the fruits of their labor and to not just be gig workers \u2014 which is fine if that\u2019s what you want to do. But I think most of us went into this for a career.\u201d\n\n\n**A.I.**\n\n&gt; Iwinski touched on the rise of A.I. and the worries within the WGA. \u201cThe threat of us being replaced is not that they\u2019re going to match our quality, is going to be that our bosses aren\u2019t going to care,\u201d he explained.\n\n\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t really understand it, I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going but it seems really important. And if we don\u2019t get something codified in a language that a human being needs to do our jobs, we will never get that language and we will never have any protections,\u201d Plec said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what other unions are starting to understand as well. So it is truly the clarion call, the mockingjay of this strike.\u201d\n\n\n\n**Streaming Ratings**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe streaming era in many ways has screwed you guys,\u201d Iwinski said. \u201cIt has cut the audience out of the feedback loop of television. Because in a world where there are no ratings and a show\u2019s success or failure is based off what the numbers team can put out through a press release, in a world where you do not have the ability to permanently buy shows you love on physical media and keep them, in an era where shows are serialized to create cliffhangers but then pulled on Season 2 so you never get the satisfaction of knowing what happens in this world, you guys are being cut out, and it is not working.\u201d\n\n\n&gt; He continued, \u201cWe need to push for ratings in television\u2026 There are so many shows by people of color, there are so many shows by marginalized communities, that everyone I know in that community is watching and they cancel it [because] \u2018No one was watching.\u2019 Prove it. Show it to us.\u201d",

Crappy shows got good ratings and great shows only survived become some execs lover them (Homicide: LOTS and Arrested Development are two examples of shows that would've been cancelled if it was based on ratings alone, Breaking Bad and Seinfeld also didn't do well in their first season).\n\nStreaming services have much better numbers. the WGA should demand visibility for their members on shows they worked on along with the compensation they demand for those shows living on streaming services and not TV/cable networks and physical media",

They are demanding that the streaming services release their viewership numbers so that the cast, crew, and creators (and the audience) don't just have to take it on faith when a streaming service claims that nobody was watching it. They want the numbers.\n\nIt isn't an outrageous demand, either. It's the way things used to be before streaming dominated the market.",

With 22 episodes, episodes premiere while you\u2019re still writing and producing new episodes. Making adjustments and listening to critics, and sometimes even just seeing a product in final form will give writers a chance to adjust and change. Most iconic shows (Parks and Rec, Brooklyn Nine Nine, The Office etc) had lackluster first seasons that improved and hit their grooves starting later in the first seasons or second season. That improvement only happens if you are able to see first hand how people like your product and you can adjust. \n\nWith SVOD, you have an entire season written out and outlined before production even starts. Usually 10 episodes. Then writers aren\u2019t being paid to be on set, and unless they\u2019re a showrunner, they\u2019re probably already on their next project. So any on set issues like continuity, practicality, or even lack of chemistry between leads, the writers arent there to help adjust. when the show premieres and all the episodes drop, 2 years after the show was written, the problems that could have been solved with a writer on set are magnified and the show does poorly due to low production value and then gets cancelled. No opportunity for improvement, no QA to make sure the show is representative of best quality.",

But performance is just one part of the picture, so you won't be able to actually judge how unfair it was. Things like the budget, things like other shows, things like the viewership's demographics, things like the show's potential...  So this disclosure will only open the door to making this even more public, and demanding even more data, making it even more of a mess. \n\nLike, what would be the \"fair\" targets for a minority-lead show? The same, in the name of equality? Proportionate to the audience? Proportionate to the population? And if the male-led show performs better, is it enough to cancel the female-led show, or will it only work one way? \n\nHonestly, I think they should make *cancelling* better - most importantly, no cliffhangers. And that's on writers too. There's so much content that we don't really need dozens of shows that go on and on.",

We produce the most watched shows\". How are investors going to know? How can you know if an investment is good or bad if the info on how many are watching is totally  obscure? Yes, you know the subscriber numbers, but are people really watching your shows? What is a good investment in a show if I don't know how many people watch? Is investing on Netflix better than WBD just on their subscriber numbers?  A show is ending, how can I know if a sea of people are going to cancel because it's ending? Does Succession's ending mean that I should look elsewhere because it's taking its subscribers with it? Could it be insider trading if the executives have info about viewership numbers they do not disclose to the general public? Maybe you get the viewership numbers for shows in the quarter and notice that people are not watching at all so you sell your stock because the company is about to tank. \n\nAlso for advertisers. Everyone is getting ad versions of their services. How can I know your show is worthy of the sum you're asking? Am I getting shortchanged?",

The Office was famously on the chopping block for its entire run even when it had high ratings... well high for NBC standards back then. It survived due to an NBC executive who fought to keep it in the air. Many other executives wanted to cancel it because they didn't get the show. They can also cancel successful shows if they deem them too expensive. SWAT got cancelled even with good ratings because Sony and CBS got in a fight over money, so CBS decided to cancel it. Other shows get cancel due to fights with the creators or the producing company. One time Lost and Desperate Housewives were in danger because the executive who approved them got sacked because of that very reason, for approving those shows. When they got crazy successful they kept them. In TV when you change division heads it often happens that projects or shows get cancelled because they don't align with the vision of the new head. Sometimes it happens that they know a show is successful, but they want to maximize profit so they cancel expensive shows even if successful to fill the time slot with a cheaper show because it helps the margin. That's what's happening at Max right now. Successful shows that are too expensive so they cancel them for their cheaply produced crap Discovery is known for.",

[...] I'm all for transparency in show ratings, but I don't think making the numbers public will suddenly save niche shows. \n\nI think the point is that the media companies *are* greedy and would like to cut costs wherever possible, which is how we have gotten into this mess in the first place. They've cut writing staff sizes down to almost nothing, cut the amount of billable hours, and cut the amount of time writers are able to shadow the crew on-set (which impacts vertical mobility.), all while making record profits. And by keeping viewership numbers confidential, it removes the writer's ability to bargain for better compensation by leveraging the relative success of their work.\n\nThis isn't being presented as a magic bullet solution that's going to save television, but it is one point among many that the WGA is trying to negotiate.",

But it's fucking up a very visible industry with some of the most visible (non-hated) unions in the country. Tech companies overvaluing themselves to chase maximum profit on the IPO is a foregone conclusion and unless there's some intervention to force transparency with the data they claim to use, it'll ruin this arm of the entertainment industry.",

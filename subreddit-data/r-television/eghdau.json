If it grows enough it can become a whole other horrible thing, but I dont remember what its called.\n\nEdit: I was frustrated I couldn't remember more about them. They're even more horrible, they feed on pregnant women by hiding under their bed, killing the mom and unborn child. And there is an elven ritual (this can be done in The Witcher 3:wild hunt) where you basically give it a proper burial and solve the problem without killing the baby monster, its then called a lubberkin.",

It honestly annoys me how so many people are complaining about the timeline and just seem to have missed the sometimes really obvious clues in the episodes like the young King of Temeria and his sister at Aretuza. Not every show has to be hand-fed, and there are plenty of other shows that are well-loved with confusing timelines or even episodes that were aired out of order. Maybe people need to spend less time on their phones when they're watching shows that actually demand their attention.",

The fundamentals are all pretty solid, and the casting of the core characters (Geralt, Yennefer, Ciri, Jaskier) are all fantastic in my opinion. We already know they\u2019ve replaced the costume designer, and there shouldn\u2019t be timeline confusion now that they\u2019re all converged. Pretty much the rest of the most noted flaws can be fixed by additional budget (given the show appears to be a clear success) and by tightening up the plot writing. There\u2019s a lot of potential for it to hit its stride and go from being enjoyable but flawed to being truly great.",

Trying to make it obvious to the viewers they are the scary bad guys. I'd rather they went with a less two dimensional approach. Give them fancy or clean looking armour that reflects their religious zeal, or righteousness. Most bad guys don't think of themselves as the bad guys, why would they **try** to make dark and scary looking armour?",

The way the crinkled surface reflected light in those scenes made it look like some sort of malevolent smoke or evil spirit. The effect was better than quite a bit of the CGI. It just looked like absolute heck in daylight which is obviously a problem, but those aren't the key Nilfgaard scenes this season so I can definitely see why the decision was made.",

Both Elantris and some of the Mistborn series were out at that point. \n\nI know this is going to get me voted down into oblivion but I feel it needs to be said. I'm really excited for the WoT TV series but I hope they prune and trim the story a bit. The fact that there are thousands of named characters is actually a bad thing IMO. The books needed more focus and less random sub-plots and digressions. I feel Sanderson actually did a masterful job actually pulling it all together and closing it out.\n\nThe story is so good but it feels like such a slog at times that now that I know how it goes I just can't bring myself to read it all cover to cover again.",

In the Geralt timeline, Renfri makes conversation to Geralt about how the young Queen Calanthe of Cintra just won her first big military victory, which puts the Geralt timeline decades earlier than the Ciri timeline. Then when the Queen is talking to Mousesack, she mentions that *he* \\[Geralt, but not identifiable until episodes later\\] is locked in the Gatekeep and then they talk about destiny and bringing Ciri &amp; Geralt together. \n\nAlmost never say this, but I think that if this series were released weekly that the community would've done more sleuthing (similar to Westworld) and the timeline elements of the show would have been more enjoyable for a lot of people.",

The names of the supporting characters hadn't really stuck in my head at that point, so I glossed over that detail until I rewatched the episodes afterwards.\n\nIt took me a bit to figure out the time line, but when dead characters showed up I figured some sort of time jump was afoot. The alternative would have been to do them all in chronological order, which would make it difficult for the writers to cut away from one scene to another.

Henry Cavill is great as Geralt, and the rest of the cast did really well with what they had to work with. But the way the story was structured in this first season was a bit off-putting, and I can imagine a lot of people not feeling it. There's a lot of lore dumped all at once, most often via exposition, and the time-skips were not the effective tool the creators likely hoped they would be; it felt like the creators were scrambling to throw a bunch of scenes together to get some semblance of a coherent plot.\n\n\nOverall, it all felt like a pilot episode. IMO, the show would have been a bit better if it focused a lot more on Geralt doing his Witcher business, taking on monster hunting contracts and solving mysteries, introducing the world and lore bit by bit. The best moments of this show were hands down when Geralt was going about his business and when characters were interacting with him, specifically. I didn't care much about anyone else in the show, save Yennifer.",

Playing all 3 may be a bit much, plus 1 and 2 are not nearly as good from what I hear.",

I hesitate to compare to Game of Thrones, but season 1 of that had the whole Kings Landing plot line, plus Tyrion's adventures, capture, and escape, as well as everything happening at the Wall. You also learned about the characters through their actions and reactions to events. We didn't spent 3 episodes on Tyrion's miserable childhood for example.\n\nIn comparison the Witcher felt VERY character focused. I like the characters, and the setting, but I wish more happened.  The only significant plot line was the invasion by Nilfgarde, and even that is very much told through the characters.\n\nI hope they do more with the characters next season.",

It sometimes feels like they ran over budget halfway through and used volunteers to do the rest of effects and editing. There are also facepalming writing decisions they changed from the books that just don't work when the book version was spectacular. All in all, if I were a paid critic I would probably blast the season as a whole. But as a fan of the series and being starved for fantasy content in movies and TV, I loved the show and will probably watch it a couple more times before season 2 is released.",

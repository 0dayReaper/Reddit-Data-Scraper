It's an unsolicited reminder about our own mortality and that illness and death is awaiting us all; some sooner rather than later.   \n\nWhile I feel a somewhat detached and impersonal sense of condolence for the actors who have been part of our lives indirectly, it's genuinely more about the selfish loss we will face one day.   \n\nWe come into this world alone and we will leave it alone despite all the loving members of our circles being with us in our time of need, it must be the most terrifying thought to know our time is coming to an end and you'll be going there; wherever there is, alone and by yourself.  \n\nI'm currently caring for a parent who has dementia and it's a cold comfort for me to know they're not over analyzing about the end like the people around them; I've certainly never had a day go by without thinking about what life will be like when they're gone.",

But it was instrumental in reconnecting with my adult siblings, deprioritizing, and generally being more appreciative of daily blessings like, you know, a functioning mind and another day to live. I also discovered that my Christian faith did not crumble under the death of my mom and dad (he died shortly after), as I sometimes feared, but after severe strain it has actually grown stronger, though more simple and compassionate, I think.\n\nAnyway, I genuinely hope you can get some emotional, physical, and all around rest. I\u2019m sorry for all you and your loved ones are going through.",

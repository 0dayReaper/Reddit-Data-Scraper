    "postText": "One of the things I like about streaming is finding these hidden gems. I was too young in the 2000s and probably wouldn't watch something like that at the time. I was looking for a new thriller show to watch and stumbled across it. The first episode of the first season is just okay. After that I wasn't sure, but since the series is episodic decided to check IMDB and find the best episodes this series had to offer and wow.\n\nThis stuff is emotional. I've seen four of the best so far and clearly the writing gets better in the later seasons. No spoilers, but if you're into crime dramas. Check this one out. A Perfect Day is gut wrenching.",

The show is also a lot better if you are aware of what inspired each episode. The 1st episode is inspired by the Martha Moxley/ Michael Skakel case (teenager boy murders 15 year old girl. They were both from a very affluent community, and he just happened to be a cousin of Robert F Kennedy\u2019s wife) me &amp; my sister were really into history &amp; true crime, so we knew what inspired the majority of the episodes. it\u2019s a really good show, and I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to skip episodes for their 1st watch thru, because the detectives life struggles are told over multiple episodes, in the background until it finally becomes the main focus of a episode.",

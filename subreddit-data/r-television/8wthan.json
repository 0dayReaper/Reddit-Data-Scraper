All the great book series that people remember are *finished* series. Sure, his series is pretty good, but I'm going to suggest other series of books to any kids I might have because why would I suggest an unfinished series when there are great, *finished* works. I can't really recommend it to anyone since it isn't going to be complete. Tolkien's lord of the rings would not have had its surge of popularity in the 60/70's if he never bothered to finish it.",

The show just put her on a boat... if he does that the same, his knot is untied and he can write again.  I think it's less about writers block these last few years and more about semi-retirement.  He hates writing and loves having written and he has no real motivation to keep doing something he hates just to get to the end so he can be done loving the completion.  I want him to finish the books but I've come to terms with the possibility that I may be forever waiting.  You're absolutely right about the show writing - the show hasn't ever described clothing in a way that made me think it might be delicious, GRRM can somehow do that every few pages.",

GRRM is too much of a perfectionist though. The problem with the Meereen knot is that he needs all these characters from different areas to reach Meereen at around the same time so Dany can leave, and its very hard to do that organically. Meanwhile the show can just say 'fuck it' and have the characters basically teleport to Meereen, which works well enough under the circumstances.",

But Sanderson did a great job wrapping it up and I really appreciated his ability to stay true to Jordan\u2019s vision and still give it a bit of his own voice.

Despite all the waiting and impatience.\n\nI binged P&amp;R after being retroactively made aware of its excellence and I only watched an episode a week towards the end because it was just more fulfilling and I had time to digest the subtle character arc changes/ tie-ups so much better.",

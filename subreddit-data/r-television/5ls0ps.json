Giving them the ones they're missing isn't going to help their poker game, because the ones they do have are all from Uno.\n\nEdit: Guys, I really need you to focus up here. I'm getting lots of PM's from angry people about how I apparently hate children, and I've somehow sparked a political debate. Well, as God as my witness: it's all true. Down with science, and your children, and your children's children! You'll rue the day you ever strayed to your non-gregorian calendars! Ahaha-ahahahahaha!\n\nSeriously, though. Jokes.\n\nEdit 2: Day 7. A disturbing number of people continue to take me seriously. I've gone into hiding now, where seclusion has driven me partly mad. I cooked and ate the neighbor children already, and I fear starvation will soon take me. My only solace is this signed photo of the 1997 Denver Broncos. God help us. God help us all.",

This is because humans make decisions based solely on emotional, non-factual concerns like credibility and ego. \n\nYou, the reader, do this too. Everyone does. Very few people are adequately informed on any specific topic to parse out the state-of-the-art literature and credibly critique it (and there is always something to critique). We've developed shortcuts, based on social signals, to determine what we consider credible.\n\nWhen someone expresses their beliefs to you, they're not saying they've objectively analyzed the data and come to this conclusion (although this may have played a small part in some of their decisionmaking, emotional content always overwhelms it). They're telling you  about their experiences, their worldview, their upbringing, and their self-image. It's best to approach these conversations for what they are: a human trying to express his/herself to another human, not an entry in the local science contest.\n\nSomeone is **not** inherently dumb because they accept some set of beliefs you hold in derision, no matter which side of the aisle they're on; this goes for everyone, including Christians who hold atheists in derision and vice-versa. They're telling you \"I value tradition, heritage, and restraint\" or \"I value innovation and experimentation\". The truth is everyone values all of these things, your specific beliefs are just about the mix you come down on due to your unique life experiences.\n\nWe need to stop being so mean to each other.",

It doesn't make them assholes (although some of them are) but I can see why they could come off this way.\n\nIn physics, there is a saying that goes like \"everything is impossible until it becomes trivial.\" This can explain why they might sound a bit condescending when they explain something. In physics, when you understand something well, it's usually cristal clear in your mind.",

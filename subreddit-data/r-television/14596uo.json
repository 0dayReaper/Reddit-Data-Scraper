OR, they are playing talk shows which tells me I'm probably in a building full of passive morons.\n\nWondered if TV Land is still doing marathons and if so I have to convince bars and restaurants to switch to TV Land.",

If the local watering hole has it on their barebones cable package, I will ask for it.\n\nFound out a while back that bars and restaurants actually pay many times the normal rate for cable. They have to assume their business is full therefore entertaining many more customers and so it costs much more. Completely ignoring the fact their ads are reaching many more people, but whatever. Thats life.",

Best movie I've never finished for sure.",

I really like and appreciate Variety\u2019s work too, but just wanted to point out in that industry and digital outlets - what the internet thinks is definitely weighed heavily",

I\u2019m hoping Eggers sees something in Depp that hasn\u2019t been brought out yet and she wasn\u2019t forced into the part by the studio. Would have loved to see somebody like Emma Stone in the role. Still hopeful since Eggers is such a singular filmmaker, but the scrutiny on Depp is going to be immense.",

Whoever convinced The Weeknd to adopt this dark/mysterious persona probably understood that *they themselves* didn\u2019t have the voice/look to pull it off, but The Weeknd *did*. And do you think Rihanna, who was like 18 when she first started breaking out, had a fully-formed persona and sound? A lot of pop stars *are* stage-managed and directed, but they receive the credit as the artist. And yes, some artists really are \u201cauteurs\u201d like Prince, defining their sound and their  public persona. But others are more akin to actors in a big production, and no matter how brilliant the production, the performer gets the bulk of the credit.",

Yes the Weeknd was wooden but so was LRD and her performance lacks the vulnerability the character of Jocelyn needs (and the visine induced tear drop in the opening scene isn't enough) and she seems miscast in the role. \n\nThe Weeknd had very little acting in the first episode. He barely spoke yet people keep focusing on his acting instead of LRD. \n\nThe show isn't \"edgy\" or shocking. Even LRD masturbating and chocking herself just seemed like \"Oh here we go again Levinson getting paid to film his fantasies Oh Wow so excited Oh wow so shocking Oh Wow...Yawn\"\n\nNepo Baby Levinson and Nepo Baby LRD were the worst things about The Idol but people are focused on insulting the Weeknd when he barely had any speaking lines.",

The nudity and sex scenes are far from the worst I\u2019ve seen on HBO. And I didn\u2019t find the writing to be terrible\u2014a bit shallow maybe, but nothing so egregious. I guess my biggest complaint is that I didn\u2019t find the show very entertaining, nor did I find it as funny or clever as the writers think it is. I\u2019m debating whether I want to continue this show or not, because I\u2019m at least somewhat curious to see where the story goes, and if there is a light at the end of this tunnel. But not so curious that I\u2019m dying to watch the next episode right away.",

Btw, I like Sam's work, and I think Euphoria is a good show, so I'm not just hating because Sam is kind of a tool.\n\nI didn't like the entire episode for many reasons, but I think the first 20 or so minutes were the worst part. The reason people are saying that it's \"torture porn\" is because you see Lily's character being openly exploited, taken advantage of, and basically just having a bunch shitty things happen to her with no forgiveness or tact on the part of the writers. \n\nIn fact, the show seems to revel in its own predatory vision and cruelty, by lingering on women's bodies for absurd amounts of time, and generally having a very detached and apathetic approach to the morality of the characters. I'm not saying that every character has to preach to you all the time about how good or bad something is. Succession, and all kinds of other media, prove that you can make morally bankrupt characters interesting and understandable while also providing a fairly good message for the audience. However, The Idol has no idea how to do that, or it just doesn't want to, because everyone is horrible all the time with no point or message for the viewer.\n\nThe entire sequence, which I think goes on for WAY too long, is about the photo of her with cum on her face. That's already a degrading thing to explore in a show, but it could be done okay in the right hands.\n\nThe problem with this part is, the show never really condemns any of it. In fact, it seems to kind of do the \"she was asking for it\" kind of shit, by making Lily's character so overly sexual, and going on and on about how she doesn't have a problem going topless, and Hank Azaria locking the intimacy coach in the other room, and on and on and on. Also, later in the show, it's shown that she seems to have a kind of rape fetish or some shit, which makes the \"she was asking for it\" angle even more set in stone.\n\nBut, that's just my view.\n\nTL;DR \nThe show goes overboard with its exploitation. It doesn't properly condemn the bad actions and behavior of its characters. It seems to enforce some seriously questionable shit. Overall, it's just not that well-written, well-acted, or even well-made.",

I think it was Dan Attias (who has done a lot of work with Always Sunny) that said TV directors form their own kind of little industry. Your goal is more to just show up, get your shots, and don't fuck up what the showrunners are going for. \n\nThough single camera sitcoms are much easier to do that with.",

Vilgefortz was the leader of the mages of the north.\n\n\nThats IT, nothing else is said about it. It is the least described battle of the books. There is no mention of Cahir in that fight (since it doesnt make sense, he was near Cintra looking for Ciri), there is no description of Vilgefortz fighting or losing, nor the tactics used or anything else.

It's completely reasonable that the straightforward and relentless way Geralt fights is hard for Cahir to deal with, while the way Vilgefortz fights is just easier for him to understand. It doesn't necessarily mean that they fucked up because there isn't a strict power scaling.\n\nThat being said, I was also displeased that Vilgefortz got his ass beat. I'm not defending the way they displayed it in the show or agreeing with it, I'm just talking specifically about how a person can lose to someone and beat someone else, even if the one they beat is stronger than the one they lost to.",

They chose anamorphic lenses, which capture a wider image than more standard, spherical lenses. A side effect of some anamorphic lenses (some say drawback, some say feature) is the distortion and blur around the edge of frame. Going back and rewatching, you\u2019ll notice that the blurred edges will be more prevalent in wider shots than in close-ups, because it comes from the way the glass in the lens is bending the light around the edges of the lens, which isn\u2019t seen in tighter lenses. They aren\u2019t doing it to \u201ccover\u201d for \u201cshitty cinematography\u201d, it was a choice by the cinematographer. It\u2019s a look that can be used very well, but it does indeed feel odd in this show.",

I'd like to know where you heard that Furdik did the reshoots considering he was the main coordinator for the show, hence it wouldn't make sense to have him redo *his own* fight if it wasn't good the first time.",

No tactics, no real *anything* other than a bunch of people running at each other, some close-up limb/head chops, and plot-relevant characters being ignored so they can have their dramatic moments.\n\nEdit: Game of Thrones is also an offender in this category. Especially the battle on the Wall between the Night's Watch and the Wildlings. What made it tragic in the book is that the Watch isn't really in danger from the Wildlings because, despite being vastly outnumbered, they have superior tactical training and a massive terrain advantage, while the Wildlings just try to Zerg rush the Wall over and over and get boiling oil and arrows poured down on them. Jon Snow is *begging* them not to keep trying, because he likes them. When Ygritte dies, he doesn't cradle her dramatically in the middle of the battlefield - he finds her later, dead by some unknown hand during the fighting, and the only resolution Jon gets is that he can be sure it wasn't him that did it. I hate how they just simplify things on fantasy shows into \"one side runs against the other side screaming, oh here's some arrows too, and all the named characters do something cool or emotional.\"",

It makes the plot actively worse, and the fight scene isn't even that good - because it wasn't originally written to be the true important part of the chapter.",

Even then, I was mostly fine with the CGI (though the spider and the dragon were pretty weak-looking efforts), and the costumes didn't bother me at all.\n\nThe writers didn't need replacing, but they did need some *correction*.  And depending on what level certain decisions were made, either the showrunner or a director or two could justifiably fall on their proverbial sword.\n\nAll in all, S1 was acceptable and could certainly be improved... but I don't think anybody needed to lose their job over it.",

                            "comment": "The Nilfgaardian armour isn't entirely on the costume designer though. It was a creative decision and caused by rushed production as well.\n\n&gt;\u201cI think the thing with the Nilfgaardians was that Lauren, quite early on, said to be that because this sort of started them, like before Pavetta\u2019s betrothal the Nilfgaardians are still sort of a backwater kind of nothing, it\u2019s not a strong state or anything, and suddenly with Fringilla\u2019s help it becomes this huge sort of menace and the thing with the Nilfgaardians is that they were not supposed to be this elite, trained, perfectly clad army like the Cintrans are. Nobody knows where they\u2019ve come from and how they\u2019ve come there so quickly because a lot of them are sort of fanatically brainwashed into joining this army. [\u2026]\n\n&gt;\u201cThe concepts we\u2019ve had, we had like a week from pen and paper to setting the costumes to be made because, obviously, I had to make like 250 sets to be shooting in less than two months from sort of zero, which\u2026 one or two days\u2019 delay and\u2026 those scenes and the locations were already set and we could not move those scenes. So it was like, damn, we have to have this on the ready, and I was like: \u2018Guys, we need to have a sign-off on this armor, what do you want?\u2019 It was like: \u2018We don\u2019t want anything Eastern, we don\u2019t want anything traditional, we don\u2019t want Renaissance armor, we don\u2019t want medieval armor just black, you know what I mean?\n\n&gt;\u201cIt needs to be something never seen before, which in terms of armor is not an easy call. Armor\u2019s been around since three, four thousand years ago in various forms and just about everything has been seen before. But the thing is with the Nilfgaardian armor had to be something weird. It\u2019s not about them fighting and being this protective-like, full on kind of brilliant armor. They\u2019re almost supernatural. It\u2019s like: \u2018How many of these people have come? From where? How is it even possible?\u2019 Obviously Fringilla has used her magic powers but the armor itself needed to have an organic rather than a man-made look. It needed to be almost formed, grown and that was behind the idea that it was very veiny and had reference to nature, to trees, to bark and moss and decaying stuff.\n\n&gt;\u201cSo that was what we were going for. They had to have this weird, alien feel that wasn\u2019t like anything else around. And also, struck horror into the people because it\u2019s like \u2018What are these beings? Where are they from?\u2019 So that was the main calling point, and I did some different designs and Lauren signed off on the ones she liked. And, again, I think if you watch it as a whole, it works. If you watch it with the idea that these aren\u2019t the Nilfgaardians we know from the games then obviously\u2026 they\u2019re not, and they weren\u2019t supposed to be, but you know\u2026 You can\u2019t please all the people all the time.\u201d",

The existence of Ciri could've been the cliffhanger. They could later use flashbacks to understand the scope of how Geralt was bounded to Ciri. The Law of Surprise episode was the highest point of the series (imo), after that it went downhill as they tried to cram as much as they could so Geralt and Ciri would be together before the Second Season.\n\nAnd yes. The whole Yennefer plot falls flat because it wasn't properly set up. Again, because of the rushing.",

The circumstances seem pretty straightforward, it was a crash while doing something that is very dangerous.  May have something to do with him also stating that they did everything they could?\n\nEdit:  Added the name of who I was referencing.",

The media were quick to come out with stories about how he shouldn't have been driving it as he wasn't qualified to do so (he was) and was recklessly trying to do a 2nd attempt at qualifying for a speed record that required him to do the run in both directions (he was on his 7th run when he crashed and never got anywhere near record speeds on any of them).",

I just went to the Alvord Desert for the first time ever this weekend, and I had no idea this went on there - so I was really surprised Monday morning to see a freaking rocket car break the sound barrier across the desert. It was only 20 minutes before we left and was totally unplanned. And there were probably only half a dozen other camp sites there, at most, for the whole weekend.\n\n  \nNever would I have guessed that the driver would not only die the next day, but that I knew of her from watching Mythbusters. This is heartbreaking to hear.  \nI will say though, that rocket car was one of the coolest things I've ever seen in-person. And the sound! When it broke the sound barrier, the sonic boom had us all cheering. Thanks Jessi for giving us that amazing, once-in-a-lifetime experience.",

I knew my family would be alright. I made sure in my last days that they would be taken care of.\n\nObviously, I ended up not dieing. But I came very close, and it's been a very long journey. My 35 year old body is that of  an 80 year old man, but my mind is sharper than ever. And for the first time in my life, I'm not afraid.\n\nBut with not being afraid, you get a little cocky. When you are not afraid of really anything, do you make the best decisions. At least I don't, I don't always think through my actions. I've never thrown a punch or really been in that situation. But the last few months I've put myself in bad situations by escalating situations that could have ended poorly if I wasn't removed from the situation.\n\nIt's nice to be free from fear, but I have to relearn boundaries.",

I was lucky and emergency crews arrived very quickly, but I was in a process before they saved me.  It was just a dream state, but turned up to 11.  Like tripping acid while dreaming.  Extremely lucid.  It felt like I was there for weeks, when in reality it was maybe 10 minutes.  I know it was my brain creating a comfort for me, preparing itself to slip away.",

You reason with yourself and realize, there is no way to get off this ride now, you're committed, just take a deep breath and enjoy the view of park and look at as much as you can before the drop. I still have those moments, but I find my center, enjoy the ride. Nothing matters, they don't like me? I don't care anymore. I don't have time to cater to their needs, this is my time now. Cereal for dinner? Fucking right. Crocs with socks and shorts because it comfortable as hell? Goddamn right, fuck your rules of fashion. Live life like it's going to end tomorrow. It just might.",

I wish him Godspeed and peace as an old friend. We will miss him.\n\nEven as someone who has only been alive for 31 years, I absolutely feel the same way.  I haven't even watched Jeopardy in years, outside of clips posted online, but I too feel like he is an old friend.  \n\nGrowing up in the 90's he was a staple of my childhood.  We sat down for dinner when the world news came on at 6:30.  We were finishing up and watched Wheel of Fortune at 7.  Jeopardy at 7:30.  Then a sitcom or two until it was time for bed as a kid.  \n\nEven at 6 or 7 years old I liked watching Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy.  It was a routine.  I didn't know most or any of the answers, but something about them was just *nice*.  Maybe it was simply the fact it was a routine.  Maybe there was something special about those shows back then.  I don't know.  \n\nI don't watch that much live television these days, and with my work schedule I'm asleep at that time.  \n\nThere are days though, when I think back to those simple, routine nights, and miss them.",

Or, more likely actually, they just didn\u2019t believe that I could feel it and were just drugging me to shut me up. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the look on that nurses faces when I pulled my arm to me on the gurney from surgery to recovery (it was supposed to be dead, nerve block and I was supposed to have no movement or feeling from my shoulder to my fingertips.) Or when, 20 minutes later, I was fully awake and screaming that my fucking bone hurt. High as balls and sobbing. I have a HIGH pain tolerance. But goddamn bone pain is a BITCH. I have never had a nurse RUN for pain medication before, 2 doses of fentanyl within 5 minutes. They had done fucked up and I am eternally grateful that she realized that. \n\nAnyway. Yes, awake.",

It\u2019s such a difficult thing to fathom that you accept your fate and just go kinda with it. In my dads case he didn\u2019t seem sad about it. Upset more with situations in his life but not the idea of death itself. It was weird in his final weeks I remember hold his hand every night while he fell asleep wondering if it was his last.

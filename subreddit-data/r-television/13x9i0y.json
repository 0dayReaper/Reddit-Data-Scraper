    "postText": "I first watched this show several years ago, and remember thinking it was one of my favorite comedies and favorite TV shows. But I had kind of forgotten about it. So I just started re-watching it again. And I\u2019m only on episode six, but Will Forte\u2019s performance is so nuanced and perfect. I mean, he hits every subtle note in his interactions with the other characters. He conveys levels of snark, selfishness, and manipulation through facial expressions and body language alone that are the comedic equivalent of a Daniel Day Lewis performance. How he did not win all of the awards, and how the show was canceled on a cliffhanger without getting an ending worthy of the show\u2019s incredible quality, is a terrible injustice. If you haven\u2019t seen it, I highly recommend it.",

His character was completely baulked and he became kinda nauseating. Despite that the show definitely had it's moments, I thought Kristen Wiig's character was a highlight.",

I don't think it would have been nearly as good with any other actor, Will really was the perfect actor for that roll and he absolutely killed it.  I'm still hoping for a 5th season someday even if it's just a small chance, I can't even understand why it was cancelled in the first place\n\nBtw i'm not sure if you've seen it or not, but Will himself has came out and talked about some of the spoilers of season 5 and explained what was supposed to happen after the big cliff hanger. Definitely worth reading and it helps lessen the blow of that massive cliff hanger ending",

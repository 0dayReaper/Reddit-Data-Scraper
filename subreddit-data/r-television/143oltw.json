It did for me at least. watching Escape from Pretoria i never thought of harry potter, i was engrossed in his acting. \n\nNot to mention Imperium (the final act specifically). His raw intensity was so divorced from anything Harry Potter.\n\nAs long as he keeps doing what he'd doing, I don't think his acting lecagy will be \"happy potter kid\" like the other two. It'll be something much greater. Dudes still young. He might have another 30-40 years in him if it's his true passion.",

And on the DC side of things, Flash just finished one of its best runs ever, and it's all about Wally and Linda West balancing heroism with parenthood. It can work, so long as the creators are actually allowed to do something with it.",

I may be harsher because I was expecting a 8 from the previews and source material.\n\nPersonally I think he should try working on projects closer to home and build himself up again in period or character roles, he's not really a leading man IMO. \n\nHarry Melling who played Dudley in the Harry Potter films is a good example. Of all the kids in HP, I never really expected him to be among the better actors. He's quietly building up a pretty good post-HP CV. \n\nHolland may be too big for those sort of roles but if he wants to be taken seriously, it's better than what he's currently doing.",

The question in this thread is to the quality of the roles he's getting.\n\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, despite being Hollywood's \"It\"-boy already, didn't really start to showcase his full potential and play interesting characters outside of just \"He's hot and can read lines\" until he was around Holland's age now.   And as I was trying to say with the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet comment, a lot of the best roles with auteurs are going to those of his counterparts that aren't contractually tied to a bunch of different studio tentpole projects already.  \n\n\n\nMy point is simply that most male lead actors don't really seem to start branching out until they're 30+, as that's the range with the widest array of unique characters.",

I saw an interview with a decently famous actor talking about how they choose the projects they sign onto. From what they said the big issue is that scripts are constantly in flux and have a million different people all over them. At the time when you as an actor have to decide if it\u2019s something you want to be in. \n\nSo basically you might sign onto a movie thinking it\u2019s gonna be one thing and by the time there ready to start shooting. The script has changed 3 times and what you originally signed onto to be in does not really exist anymore. Also don\u2019t forget editing, editing can make or break a film or tv show. You as the actor probably have little to no say in deciding what scenes are cut and which ones are kept. \n\nThe point is there is a lot of stuff that is totally outside an actors hands and it\u2019s not as simple as finding an agent that knows if a film will be crap or not.",

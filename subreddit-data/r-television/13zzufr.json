    "postText": "Hey there I just wanted to pass along this very fascinating look into the production of the Lost pilot which was at the time the most expensive pilot in TV history, and remains to this day the 6th most expensive pilot. \n\nThis is a very meticulously researched documentary with the thoughts and reflections of many people involved with the production who have seldom been able to tell their LOST stories. The story of the inception of LOST is linked heavily to the changing tides in the late 90's and early 2000's that went on over at Disney and this goes into all of that in a way I've never heard before! Truly fantastic work!  \n\n\nI think this documentary is particularly interesting in the light of the the revelations contained in Mo Ryan's new book \"Burn it Down\" for the lens it gives into the world of corporate pressure and the holding on company lines for certain long held bits of lost trivia.   \n\n\nThis really is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, and the insight it provides into television production I think is really special. Please check it out over on the legendary Kuhpunkt's Youtube page!  \n\n\n[815 - The Story of the Lost Pilot](https://youtu.be/2euw0L9XR4o)",

Some states have municipal jails, some don\u2019t. Some have municipal or \u201cmayor\u2019s\u201d courts, some do it by county.\n\nSometimes in counties where the whole county (or most of it) is part of a city, the sheriff only does jail/court (bailiffs), specific county properties (like an airport), or various things state law requires the sheriff to do (e.g., gun permits). Some, like Las Vegas merge city police and sheriffs departments where city lines zig-zag or where the city proper functionally grows beyond its chartered boundaries.\n\nThe one where I live does it that way and I\u2019m pretty sure the neighboring county does too. The sheriffs office also contracts police services for some of the smaller towns that don\u2019t want/can\u2019t afford their own department.\n\nSome do it informally; just as part of their onboard/hiring process, you do some duty in different roles to have an idea how the whole system works.",

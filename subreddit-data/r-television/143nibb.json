So, your PAs, ADs, camera people, editors, all of them are tightening belts already on their last notch. To add further injury, there must be hundreds of mom and pop shops in the LA area that depend on film productions to turn a profit.\n\nMy fingers are crossed that the strike ends soon with a fair deal. Because I don\u2019t know how much more of this I, or those I work with, can take.",

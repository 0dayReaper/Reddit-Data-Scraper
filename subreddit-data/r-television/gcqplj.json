I walked in our house and walked right past him and said \u201chi sir\u201d, thinking it was a coworker or friend of my parents. \nWhen he spoke, I jumped.

There are plenty of us in the middle who are doing okay in the pandemic (although I'm personally going to lose 12K in variable pay), and are helping but aren't always sure how or thinking about it. \n\n\nAs a marketer, I actually thought it was great to see something squarely focused on people helping people, instead of all the nonsense about 'these unprecedented times' and emails telling me companies are in this together and here to help me pay my bill onilne.",

While we're all online *a lot* right now, typically forum culture is full of hot takes from people who haven't learned the skillset or importance of seeing complexity in issues. That's why you see so many things like immediate summary judgement or non-practical solutions to problems. You also get a lot of people who are far more articulate than say your average youtube commenter, but not educated enough on topics to actually know what they're talking about. So you get a lot of angry soapboxing that sounds legit but has irresponsible or faulty logic, and people pretending to have solutions to problems without comsidering the negative impacts they might have. That, and you add that tensions are high and people really are concerned right now  and it makes things compoundingly worse.\n\n\nA lot of balanced or educated people will be non-motivated to engage here under normal circumstances. When I'm busy enjoying life and working out of my home, for example, I simply don't have to will or drive to jump in the mix. If anything, COVID has made me realize how bizarre the meta and nature of this site is. It's a really dangerous mix of people that are too smart and articulate to comment overtly stupid or harmless nonsense like an average youtube commenter, per se, but too tribal and lazy with fact finding to be actually knowledgable about something.\n\n\nIt's weird. I'm honestly pretty close to done with commenting here.",

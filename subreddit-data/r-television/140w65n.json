            "comment": "&gt; The description of the episode, as seen on cached versions of the Vice page on Showtime\u2019s site, hinted at potentially explosive material about DeSantis, who recently entered the Republican presidential race. The episode\u2019s description reads in part, \u201c**Seb Walker investigates allegations from former Guantanamo Bay detainees that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis witnessed acts condemned by the United Nations as torture during his past service at the controversial detention camp as a Navy JAG officer.**\u201d \n\n\n* No reason was given as to why the episode was pulled. \n\n\n[You can't handle the truth!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk)",

Like why would you marry someone who basically called you ugly. And she only started going by Moonves after her husband was outed for sexually abusing women. Kinda disgusting.",

I think I took it more personally offensive that he didn't put any thought into his response. Like, if you're gonna lie to me then do a good job of it.\n\nOr hell, don't lie to me.

The best case scenario is DeSantis winning the Republican Primary by thin margins. This will inevitably cause Trump to have a hissy fit and claim that DeSantis stole the primary - which wouldn't be the first time the Republicans did this against the more popular candidate ([1912] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries)).\n\nThat may begin the movement towards the MAGA-Republicans splitting off into their own party - the Patriot Party, as Trump has already called it - leaving the Republicans with DeSantis who is eveb further to the right of Trump but in control of an RNC full of relative moderates and intelligent machiavellians like Mitch McConnell. Then Biden and the DNC will go up against two people who are splitting the far right vote, rather than one candidate concentrating the vote. Every seat in the House and a large portion of the Senate is then up for grabs -- that's likely the Democrats path to a supermajority in the House, a majority in the Senate, a majority of Governors/Secretary of States, and a few more trifectas around the country.\n\nOtherwise, the Democratic Party is looking to gain a majority in the House, but losing the Senate ([Class 1 elections favour the Republicans] (https://www.270towin.com/2024-senate-election/)).",

If anything, it might help the GOP as Trump supporters who stay home out of protest or Trump not being the Repub nominee come and vote for Trump, the MAGA nominee and vote the Repub ticket for the rest of the ballot. \n\nA supermajority in the House does the Democrats no good since there\u2019s no filibuster in the HoR. If the Democrats had a true supermajority in the house and Senate (67, not 60), they could override a GOP president\u2019s veto, and put in some Constitutional amendments that aren\u2019t likely to be ratified by 38 states unless the Democrats had the same kind of success with state legislatures as they had with getting supermajorities in Congress.\n\nAnd the only way I see that happening is if the leadership of the GOP was completely caught in a plot to overthrow the US government beyond January 6; more like 1861 and the leadership was tried and convicted and not allowed to participate in government. Fox News, News Max, etc. would have to be ruined and the GOP would have to die and a new conservative political party slowly builds strength.",

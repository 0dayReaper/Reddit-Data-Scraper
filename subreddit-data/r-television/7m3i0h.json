I just wanted to add that, regarding HDR, cameras have been HDR for a while. They're not marketed with that language, but it just means they have more dynamic range than the standards of HD video (Rec. 709). HDR has to do with monitors/TVs. So assuming a production company still has the raw footage (i see no reason why they wouldn't), they shouldn't have a problem taking an old-ish show and remastering it for HDR. It's kinda like how you can remaster old films to 4K. ",

It's the only time the Planet Earth crew has intervened to save an animal's life; they figured they might as well, since human interference is the cause of the problem to begin with.\n\nThis doesn't help much \u2014 baby sea turtle populations are still devastated by the lure of human lights and the solution is too simple and simultaneously too inconvenient, but at least take heart that the poor little turtles you saw were rescued as soon as the camera stopped rolling.",

By hosting it on their own service it costs them by increasing demand on their servers. They don't tend to keep things on there longer term. Licensing it to Netflix, or Amazon, or both mean they'd receive cash which would help recoup the costs of making the show and other BBC programmes.\n\nThere are loads of BBC shows already on Netflix. The first series of Planet Earth is even on there.",

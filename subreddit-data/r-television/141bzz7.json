Prices kept going up, content became \"trash\" (subs that cancelled would literally use that word all the time). Each reality show that got added to the networks lowered their own value in the eyes of the subs. Then what was left of scripted shows no stopped running for full seasons.\nGone were the days of \"Fall TV\" that started new seasons that would last till end of Spring. These brought value to Cable TV. Clear picture and something to tune into at least once a week.",

So you will pay for it.\n\nA popular channel to pick on, even years ago, is Fox News. Some people don't watch it, yet that channel added something like $8 a month (when I was there, likely a lot more now) &amp; why the \"Basic\" levels of cable (beyond Local Only) jumped from ~$10 to ~$60 (again, prices for when I was there. No idea what they are now for those packages). Throw in premium channels &amp; tack on ~$10 per premium bundle.",

Some stuff you can watch with just the ESPN+ subscription, other stuff you can watch on ESPN+ but only if you have a cable subscription or streaming alternative like YouTube tv. Either way you can\u2019t just stream the ESPN tv channels from there. And a lot of the time there\u2019s no way to really be sure what the event you want to watch falls under until it\u2019s started. So you could end up scrambling around for the first few minutes trying to figure out which app you need to use to watch it, or trying to find a pirate stream that isn\u2019t awful. \n\nAnd then depending on the sport and specific teams you want to watch it could be spread across  OTA, cable, and multiple different streaming services. Which just leads to people watching pirate streams because they don\u2019t want to deal with figuring out which tv and streaming packages they need to watch their teams that week.",

But there's two big reasons that I will be keeping it at least right now. A couple nights a week I play Call of Duty with friends and we normally all have the same sporting event on in the background and I always hear my cord cutter friends reacting to stuff that I watched happen 3 minutes ago, I wouldn't have fun watching from such a delay. Plus, look at the live thread for any big sporting event 60% of the comments are like \"Please DM me a stream! I wanna watch so bad!\" or \"Damn, the stream I always use was busted today anyone got another?\" \n\nThe other reason was during the Succession finale, every time there was a big episode of GoT, House of the Dragon, Succession, etc. Twitter would blow up with people saying the HBO app (whichever version it was at the time) had crashed and they were missing it. \n\nPaying more for cable and dealing with ads is 100% worth the piece of mind of not dealing with that stuff IMO. I know it isn't for everyone but it works for me.",

Plus, it allowed me to upgrade my internet speed and it still cost less than the cable bill.",

You don't have people talking about characters in commercials as memes anymore like we used to.\n\nUsed to be that everyone knew the jingles and memes and characters, but now those kinds of things just never come up. Because nobody is watching the ads anymore.",

It would be like ten minutes of a show followed by five minutes of ads. A 90 minute movie would be two and a half hours with all the ads. We could only watch for a little bit before we gave up and just listened to music on one of the music channels. \n\nI personally would be outraged to pay as much as I know some of them charge and still have to sit through so many ads. Streaming has its own problems but I\u2019ll take them any day of the week.",

No regrets at all.\nAll the channels I care about, and the ones I don\u2019t I can filter out of the listing (bye Fox News), aaaand the listing can be reordered to my own preferences. That alone is worth the cost to me.  The recording features are just the cherries on top of an already great system.",

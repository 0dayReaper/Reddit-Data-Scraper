Paramount is doing this to drive interest in SNW Season 2, which debuts on June 15. The show is set for 10 episodes which will carry it through the rest of June, all of July and all of August.\n\nbut you're probably right that eventually, they'll take SNW Season 1 off YouTube because clearly the goal is for all people watching SNW to do so as paid subscribers of Paramount+",

They had \"Covid partners\" where the cast members had to stick to pairs who don't interact for the most part because then if one cast member went down they didn't infect everyone else. That's why there's so few group scenes, and why there's that dull Seven/Rafi plot which is mostly them walking around outside that drags on.\n\nRewriting the series while shooting to account for this was basically a disaster.\n\nThe show's insurance also desperately wanted to keep De Lancie and Stewart apart due to Covid risks too, as the entire season was sunk without them and their age meant they were much more vulnerable to getting ill. Which is why they barely interact.",

I see so many people criticizing the show who clearly gave up on it pretty early. That's not to say the season (or even series as a whole) didn't have its problems, especially when they started replacing showrunners, but that first season I think has some real interesting themes. It all got overshadowed by said problems though, and people's desire for the show to be something it wasn't. Ultimately I'm glad it exists and that they tried, hopefully they don't shy away from taking risks in the future. It's not like SNW is exactly milquetoast, they literally remade an beloved TOS episode and are crossing over with an animated show this year.",

                                    "comment": "The problem with Discovery is the writing.\n\nThere are two distinct areas of writing: \u201cWhat is the story actually about,\u201d and \u201cwhat happens minute-by-minute to move the story forward.\u201d\n\nI think you are only talking about the first item, which is sort of the \u201cbig picture\u201d of the show. In my humble opinion, Season 1 of Discovery failed at this by making the introduction of this newly reimagined Star Trek universe be about the *mirror* universe. This was a HUGE conceptual mistake, because since the whole show was a reimagining, that meant *everything* about it felt weird and unusual. So now if you go for the \u201cmirror universe\u201d plot whose purpose is to compare and contrast with the \u201cnormal universe\u201d, it becomes way too convoluted when done in the context of a reboot. Just a completely wrong choice for Season 1 of the show. \n\nThe second area of writing is the actual scripts and characters and interactions that drive the plot forward. This was an even BIGGER fuck-up by Discovery\u2019s writers, because they explicitly set out to make an \u201cemotional\u201d melodrama akin to \u201cThis Is Us\u201d, and as a result inserted countless \u201ccrying\u201d scenes into every episode that appeal to a very small portion of the audience. Not only are there way too many scenes like this, but almost all of them are written extremely poorly because the emotions exhibited by the characters never feel \u201cearned\u201d or \u201cgenuine\u201d, they always come off as gross, cringy overreactions. So we as the audience are passively watching characters weeping on screen without having any emotional connection to them whatsoever. It is eye-rolling and embarrassing.\n\nSo all of this is bad, but I haven\u2019t even talked about the worst problem with the writing: the characters. Almost all of the characters are just absolute crap. There are two distinct problems with them: (1) some of them are written to behave like incompetent idiots at best, and like absolute children at worst, and (2) the rest are preoccupied with the wrong fucking thing at the wrong fucking time (see the comment above about all the crying scenes). Put it all together, and almost all of the characters can be described using one word: CRINGE.\n\nThere are many, many, many other problems with the writing I didn\u2019t even mention, like how the writers seem to have no conceptual interest in the science fiction genre in general. Like if you asked them what their favorite books are, I would bet none would list ANY work of science fiction. This complete disinterest in the genre comes across very strongly when watching this show as opposed to any other iteration of Star Trek. So in the end, the writers are not only \u201cbad\u201d in terms of their quality, but they were the wrong hires for this specific type of show. Out of the hundreds and hundreds of people who put Discovery together, that small little writing room composed of a handful of complete incompetents sank the whole fucking thing.",

First episode was great and I liked Captain Lorca as a darker captain. Wish they would have just said he was Section 31 and left it at that instead of doing the Evil-Verse thing. I also wish that Burnham was raised by random Vulcans and not Spock's step-sister which was just goofy. I also liked the janky mushroom teleport concept and while Tilly was imo the second worst Star Trek character of all time, most of the characters were pretty good, especially Saru. \n\nBut yeah after season 1 the show took a massive nosedive. I have to agree with you that the new show runners made any problems season 1 had much worse, but I do also think that the show over-complicated itself from the outset and it just tripped over itself constantly. The first showrunner definitely wasn't blameless",

Every time.\n\nThe problem is not that people aren\u2019t talking about it, it\u2019s that a lot of the old Trek fans have already checked out of ALL of these Paramount shows after enduring multiple years of that god-forsaken Discovery and Picard (season 1 &amp; 2) nightmare. A lot of people were just \u201cdone\u201d with Trek by the time Strange New Worlds came out. So now most of the discussion is basically about trying to convince those folks to give this show a chance.\n\nSo this has nothing to do with any marketing from Paramount, it\u2019s just that after years and years of garbage people are just extremely cynical and are very hesitant about giving it yet another chance.",

Sounds so easy. \n\nIf you think the concept isn't shitty than you should really explore into making that idea into a hilarious show. Like these studious will pay you big big money.

Well 1) talent recognizes talent and if it's good, they'll fund you. Because who really wouldn't want to skim $$$ off an absolute \"hilarious\" show idea? aaaaaand 2) talented workers are busy working on their talented ideas. Like nobodys on reddit saying this is a \"hilarious idea\" and yet they expect talented hilarious writers to be writing for it?

            "comment": "*\u201dThe Idol\u2019s\u201d viewership is relatively even with other recent HBO projects not based on major IP: \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d saw 944,000 premiere viewers in 2021, while \u201cWinning Time\u201d got 901,000 in 2022.*\n\nNot a breakout hit for HBO but not a disaster. A debut in line with what they were expecting. Folks gave it a chance. Word of mouth and the quality of the show will decide if this can catch on like Euphoria and The White Lotus did or if it bombs like The Nevers and Time Travellers Wife.",

A zero show that was a similar disaster idea (Idol: Weeknd being a creep cult leader on an innocent girl, who gets her nude every episode). Yet HBO managed to use social media to double down and easily win having a very shitty show like Velma. \"Hey guys, did you hear about the worst show ever?\"... Velma \"has broken the records for the biggest premiere day for a HBO Max original ____\"\n\nI legit cannot comprehend hate watching entirely something for the purpose of cancelling it so that they can go online to hate discuss (yet get surprised it's renewed?)  \n\nAnd it reeeeally looks like HBO doing the same thing again with the negative publicity. Someone is out shilling nudity articles, acting articles, showrunner articles, cannes articles, sam levinson articles, feminism articles... \n\nSuddenly 3 months from now we find out TheIdol pulled a Velma and \"has broken the records for the biggest premiere day for a HBO Max original ____\" And Getting renewed for Season2-3 due to the hate watching that was supposed to get it cancelled.\n\nAnd now no one is talking about \"not a breakout hit for HBO but not a disaster\" for a SamLevison show starring the Weeknd and Depp's daughter.\n\nThat is absolutely the most hilarious thing ever. I really kind of have to respect HBO/ads for easily influencing the social twitters/redditors into being the main important snowball that leads influencers into influencing even more people who never heard/cared/weren't going it watch it anyways. We found out months age TheIdol was bad and yet it's still a contentious topic.... \n\nLol @ /r/popculturechat  and r/Fauxmoi for being the cause of renewal on the very series they are attempting to not have renewed. There is really something sad about celebrity worship. You guys did everything to advertise the fuck out of it",

It's like saying, \"Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm are taking the same track they took with Thor: Love and Thunder.\" \n\nYes, the app's name was HBO Max, but original shows on the app were split into two categories: HBO Originals that both air on the TV channel of the same name and app, and Max Originals that are app only and are basically an entirely different division with different people commissioning shows, different people in marketing, etc. \n\nThis brand confusion is why HBO convinced Warner Bros. Discovery to remove the HBO part of the name. People, rightly, wondered why WBD got rid of the part of the brand that had the most prestige and name recognition, but the flipside is that HBO built that brand by carefully curating what shows it commissioned. Yes, every once in a while you get an Idol, but most of the time, their hit rate puts everyone else to shame. But when anything on HBO Max was seen as \"HBO,\" Casey Bloys didn't want that sullied with Velma and the slew of awful Max Originals (Peacemaker not withstanding).",

Pretty much the same shit the same people say about Euphoria.\n\nAgreed. It's definitely not the worst, just edgy/pretentious on the writing side. I think people are just eager to get on the Euphoria hate bandwagon. Idk why it surprises me each time the public opinion changes on a whim because I watched Euphoria before the whole TikTok boom (influx of younger audiences) and it was getting praises left and right for the cinematography (the writing is admittedly just ok but at least cohesive and the lead's arc was great).\n\nIt definitely got more gratuitous and the writing flopped for season 2 because Sam Levinson decided to run the ship himself. I feel like in the world of The Idol, that kind of vulgarity people hated in Euphoria makes more sense given how things are in the entertainment industry. If someone else can take the reins in the writing department this show can be half compelling. Or maybe I'm just biased because Rachel Sennott's on screen.",

What other marquee shows debuted during the same few days as The Idol?  As far as I can tell, it's just new seasons of The Righteous Gemstones, and Just Like That.\n\nIf those are the only options for a few weeks coming, even if most people don't really like the first eps of all three, they'll queue it up again in week 2, because nothing new will be showing as an alternative.",

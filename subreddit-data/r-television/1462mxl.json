We could have rebuilt this twice as big, for half as much money, but we spent so much restoring it, like a piece of art.\u201d\n\n&gt;Parker: \u201cAnd the food is excellent.\u201d\n\n&gt;Indeed, Casa Bonita returns as one of the biggest Mexican restaurants in the world, and the new executive chef, Dana Rodriguez, is a six-time James Beard Award nominee. Local fans of Casa Bonita speak of the reopening as if the beloved \u201cOrange Crush\u201d Denver Broncos of 1977 had been revived from a cryogenic state. More than 100,000 potential customers have signed up on the restaurant\u2019s website to make a reservation.\n\n&gt;The original cost of renovations was projected at $10 million. When the figure reached $20 million, business advisers encouraged Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker to pack it in. These days, Mr. Stone said, the investment was closer to \u201cinfinity dollars.\u201d\n\n&gt;Parker: \u201cIt would be way cheaper if we just went hang gliding over volcanoes. What we\u2019ve come to realize over the last couple of months is, now we have a lot of work to do to make it a sustainable business.\u201d",

One of us locals casually brings up Casa Bonita, and he just laughs.  Then more and more of us say yeah sure let's do it and he says exactly what you said here.\n\nYou should've seen his face when we pulled up.  It was like he was seeing Santa Claus real and in the flesh.",

I could picture them having celebrity appearances from throughout South Park's history, even a Snapchat filter that makes you look like you're from the show. You're right that they didn't do it for the money, but with the publicity it's gotten for its occupation of a fairly small corner of pop culture, by today's standards anyway, they're not going to really have to worry much about money anyway.",

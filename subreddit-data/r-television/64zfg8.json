Outlived her husband by a full 50 years. \n\nLiving to 99 would be sweet if you got to do it with your partner and your kids. I don't even know how many funerals she had to attend in her lifetime, though. It's crazy. ",

My grandfather died when I was 12; the day after my birthday, and the night of their 50th wedding anniversary. It broke my heart this Christmas when I was at her apartment and she'd sewn flowers over his name on his stocking, because seeing his name made her sad, and she didn't want to be sad on Christmas around my kids. \n\nSometimes she'll tell stories about growing up, then chuckle a little and end the story with, \"They're all dead now. You're all I've got.\"\n\nWomen in my family are long-lived. My maternal great-grandmother lived to 98 and died when I was 10. My paternal great-grandmother lived to 96 and died when I was 2; I don't remember her, but I have the children's books she wrote and some of her recipes. The men generally die between 60 and 75 years old, depending on lifestyle (even younger, on my husband's side of the family). I love my husband, but I know that if I have the life of my forebears, I will live a significant part of my life without him. It gives you a certain perspective about what is important. ",

Then it hits me, it's Charlie Murphy from The Chappelle Show! My heart is racing while I'm trying to figure out a way to say hello and tell him I love him on the Chappelle Show and Boondocks. But he's with his kid so I figure he wants privacy. \n\nIt's quiet on the bus until someone yells out, \"DARKNESS!\"\n\nI turn around and everyone is busting out, laughing, including Charlie and his son. Even the bus driver was laughing. That was a great moment in bus history. ",

Okay they was bitches but a lot of them had, ya know, they was cova'ed up in them curtains and stuff they be wearin'. But, I digress. It was WAR. It was war, basically. War, you know what that's like? Mother(Beeped) be like shooting (imitating a machine gun) Gah-geh-ga-ga-ge-gu-ga-gow! Bombs blowin' up. An' ya know, the shit scared me. It scared the shit outta me. Matter o' fact, I shit on myself over a dozen times. And ran out of toilet paper after the second time. So you know what that meant, right? I had to use the thumb, man, it was kinda nasty. But ya know, the good thing about it was they stopped taking me out on patrol cause my name became \"Stink Bomb,\" you know wha' I'm saying? They said I was giving away our position, because of the shit smell. That was fine with me, know wha' I'm saying? They wanted to leave me back? And I was like, \"Well (Beep) y'all. Y'all go ahead long, cause I don't need y'all anyway. I'm rich, bitch.\" (notices everyone is staring blankly at him) The fuck y'all looking at?\"",

            "comment": "So here's a story...\n\nThe year was 2005. The place was Salt Lake City. Dave Chappelle was MIA, and many of us were just learning to laugh again. \n\nYou may or may not know this, but apparently there are a lot of Mormons in Utah. Yep, it's a little known fact, but now you're in on the secret. As a result of this fact, many of the community's places of culture feature watered down events, so as not to offend those more delicate eyes, ears and hearts. You really have to watch out for that, you know. \n\nAllow me to speed this up a little - I had been set up on a blind date with a group that included my sister and her husband and some other jabroneys. The majority of this group was of a conservative nature, so we decided to attend a \"family night\" event at the local comedy club. \n\nYes, they have one in Utah. \n\nThe setup for the event was that 6-7 local comics would put on a 10-minute PG-rated set, and a panel of judges would determine a winner. The prize was something like $500 bucks. But I guess that's not the point. \n\nIt was a downright lovely and enjoyable evening. Plenty of laughs, very few naughty words or adult situations. When the time cake for the judges to tabulate their scores, we were informed that we would be treated to a special surprise set from a celebrity comedian! What luck! I'm sure people were hoping for Larry the Canle guy or Jeff Dunham. \n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, give a warm welcome to Charlie Murphy!\" the announcer announced. I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure I was the only one in the room that shouted \"YES!!!\"\n\nMy date leaned over and said, \"Who is that?\" It wasn't going to work out between us. \n\nCharlie began his set with a joke about how he received so many blowjobs at Rick James' house that his balls, unable to keep up with required semen production demands, would literally, physically deflate. It was received by nervous laughter. \n\nMy date leaned over and said, \"I don't understand what he's talking about.\"  It definitely wasn't going to work out between us. \n\nAs he continued, it became apparent that this man knew EXACTLY where he was, what night it was supposed to be, and what he was doing to these sensitive and impressionable ears, hearts and minds. It was glorious. \n\nBefore long, there was a nervous procession out the door. But my sister would have to take my date home - the man was not finished with his set!\n\nWhat a great night. Thanks, Charlie. RIP. ",

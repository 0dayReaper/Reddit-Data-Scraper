The Very Pulse of the Machine and Fish Night have mild, fairly abstracted nudity, and Night of the Mini Dead and Kill Team Kill have some brief comic nudity/sex.\n\nThat's without getting into the spectacular gore of some eps though....\n\nHonestly I do not think you can get away with this as a family show, it's not meant to be. One episode has somebody stumbling around having blinded and deafened themselves with a combat knife.",

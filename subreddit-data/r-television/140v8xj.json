Our own bargaining positions remain the same as they were on May 1, 2023**.\n\n&gt; \u201c**Last week we sent an email about how the AMPTP divide and conquer strategy won\u2019t work this time. The AMPTP will not be able to negotiate a deal for writers with anyone but us.** Today that message and the video about the path to a deal with the WGA is even more timely.\u201d \n\n* **During the last writers\u2019 strike back in 2008, the DGA made a deal with the AMPTP on the 73rd day of the work stoppage**. The main issue was residuals from what is now known as streaming. **A few weeks later, the WGA agreed to similar terms, ending its walkout after 100 days.**\n\n\n* This time around, **the DGA made its deal on the 33rd day of the WGA strike, but the WGA says the companies\u2019 \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy won\u2019t work this time.**",

The reason they want AI banned is because they don't want the studios to use AI to write a god awful script and then pay writers a rewrite fee (which is much lower than a first draft fee) to rewrite it basically from scratch. If this was allowed, it's likely it would eventually become the norm. The studios aren't slick and you clearly don't understand the writers' demands.",

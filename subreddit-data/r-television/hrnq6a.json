Once Jenna is on screen in blackface both Toofer and Liz immediately point out how bad it is and the joke is in how much of an ass Jenna is making herself. Her and Tracy are having a childish argument and acting like spoiled stars.  \n  \nLeave them up and bring back more like Song of the South and include a warning so we can discuss what we think.",

And even if they are racist, white washing the issue by removing them doesn't help at all. It's just forgetting history and I'm pretty sure we're doomed to do something or other if we do that.",

The comedy of the show comes from laughing at them being comically bad human beings and them inevitably getting what they deserve for being huge assholes. Removing episodes because the piece of shit main characters acted like pieces of shit is idiotic",

I mean the group sets out to play  D&amp;D because they see this kid is getting bullied and fear that he might end up committing suicide, so they spend time with him to try and make him feel better. Though that all gets throw out the window because a 1-2 minute scene that with in the context of the episode doesn\u2019t have anything to do with actual black face.",

I find it almost more offensive that they're pre emptively deleting \"problematic\" episodes. I'm not a racist but I could totally see a racist blaming black people from taking down their favorite episodes of tv. Regarding the dnd episode, Chang, an actual crazy person, cosplays as a dark elf. The joke is how he's completely oblivious to the fact that he did black face and instead was just role playing as a dnd race. Then Chang gets killed like almost immediately and is taken out of the game so all the time and energy spent on dressing up for the game is completely wasted. Its call humor and I can't believe it has to be explained to these networks that jokes are allowed to push boundaries. Do we really only want safe jokes about how trump is bad and how mondays are the worst? Isn't a big part of humor about pushing boundaries and making us laugh at the unexpected? We're really living in the worst timeline",

That's hilarious and very different from traditional Blackface.\n\nTraditional Blackface is meant to use ridiculous stereotypes of physical appearance assigned to all Black people to create an awful amalgamation of bigotry. Huge lips, big noses, impossibly black skin, and it was often accompanied with minstrel music meant to insult the intelligence of Blacks while glorifying the old ways of the South a la \"My Old Kentucky Home.\" That's racist. \n\nThis is portraying a specific Black person, it's meant to be ridiculous, and it's a fucking joke. I'm Black and I am unaffected by this other than being moved to laugh my ass off.\n\nA similar moment in 30 Rock is when [Jack impersonates Tracy's parents.](https://youtu.be/311PP8ahDW4) He basically imitates Red Foxx and JJ from Good Times and for a while it is actually offensive. Until the joke kicks in and it's not. When Jack imitates a corny white guy Tracy jumps in to stop him to say, \"Let's not resort to ugly stereotypes.\" This implies that Jack wasn't using stereotypes to impersonate Tracy's parents, but actually knew how they spoke and acted. \n\nIt's okay to mock racism. The only way to do it is to present it in as bright a light as possible to reveal its stupidity. It's why Clayton Bigsby is still hilarious.",

The Crows are blatant racial stereotypes, but it's hard for a young viewer now to even recognize them as such really (I sure didn't when I was young in the 80s), considering they're non human and use made up jargon and fake jive so old a kid wouldn't even recognize what it is.  The Crows are also, taken on their own merits, less offensive characters.  They're fairly strong, independent, and decent.  I mean, they're stereotypes clearly based on black people, but they don't attempt to depict the Reconstruction era south as a happy place for poor black people who are servile to white people, which seems like a much more dangerous thing to sell to kids, even if that wasn't the intention when they made SOS.",

I definitely think that art shouldn\u2019t be changed in anyway at all ever. We aren\u2019t going to forget about our past that way. We need to look at the use of racial and ethnic biases, stereotypes, and discrimination in older media as essentially \u201cwhat not to do.\u201d On a different matter in newer media people get upset over the use of the N word in Django Unchained, I think that was fairly well done. Humans were shitty people that called people the worst things we could think of. So in the sense of newer media I also don\u2019t think we should censor our representation of the past either, to accurately portray what people were like back then - good, or bad.",

Using the Lethal Weapon example from IASIP, on the surface it's just Mac trying to look like Danny Glover, which happens to involve blackface. To someone who doesn't know the context of blackface (which isn't unreasonable for a younger person growing up outside the US, especially as it becomes rarer and rarer), the only hint they get that it's problematic is Dennis disapproving of it.\n\nI think for something like blackface, where how offensive it is is not automatically obvious to someone ignorant of it's history, it makes sense to add disclaimers regardless of whether it's use is inherently offensive or not.\n\nAlso there's the simple consideration that some people may have personal history related to it, and would rather not find themselves seeing a reminder of that history while watching a comedy show.",

I\u2019ve recently had someone tell me (I\u2019m a poc) that someone wearing attire of \u201cmy\u201d culture should be offensive to me. Like wtf? Thanks but I\u2019ll decide what\u2019s offensive to me. And if someone wants to wear some attire that resembles my culture and they like it then let them. They\u2019re wearing it because they like it. Why would I stop them from doing that. \n\nI really REALLY hate this cancel culture and the wokeness of some people. And those same people try to call me racist for it. Thanks but I\u2019ll decide for myself what I want to see. I don\u2019t need to be protected by my white saviors. Sorry for the rant.",

I think after the current moral panic wanes people will wonder what was wrong with people in 2020.\n\nSo yeah I think if you want to flag an episode with a TV rating for potentially disturbing racial themes go for it, but don't take it down out of panic.\n\nSome of this stuff is from the last 15 years... tolerance for overt racism has basically been reduced to nothing for most Americans entire lives.",

She explains that the show had racial and ethnic stereotypes that were common for that time, even though they were wrong then and still are, but that taking them out would be the same as saying they never existed. I agree with this completely, and feel messages like this are useful, because they can actually start a dialogue about history and culture and race, especially with young people.",

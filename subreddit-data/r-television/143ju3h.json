    "postText": "I loved the first season of Cruel Summer, but I've been hearing mixed reviews about the second season. Some people say it's not as good as the first, while others say it's still worth watching.\n\nHas anyone here watched Cruel Summer Season 2? If so, what did you think? Was it worth watching?\n\nThanks!",

According to this interview I watched with the 3 main actors they said that after episode 2 it gets really good with a lot of twist and turns.",

I hate when shows are so well thought out and then use something so glaringly inaccurate as a main theme.  But LOVING the Private Practice family reunion!",

I think if they'd continued to maintain that as the focus, the show could have been a fun, but dumb, show that kept audiences enthralled.  The best parts of Sleepy Hollow were the moments where Abbie introduced some piece of modern culture to Ichabod and he interacted with it.  A particularly memorable scene from the first season was when Ichabod goes on the tour and keeps correcting the tour guide.  But after season two, it was such a bizarre twist where Ichabod and Abbie have to go war with his son, and then it just spiraled after that.  They focused too much on the lore, which to be honest, wasn't that compelling.",

He was a very memorable villain in season 1. In season 2, they decided to humanize him. Which wouldn't necessarily be bad if he were at least cool or interesting as a human. But he wasn't. He was a bland and milquetoast character, with a lame motivation.\n\nThey also drastically cut down the roles of certain characters (like Orlando Jones' character), and introduced some new guy no one liked. Ichabod's wife kind of got shafted too.\n\nI never finished the show.",

After all the build up, the two rarely interacted in season two. And she got virtually no development or impressive moments (despite being built up as a powerful witch), until the very end when the writers realised they had no idea what to do with her, so they had her randomly turn evil then die and get forgotten about.\n\nSo you not only downplayed fan favourites in front of someone else, but you also made it so despite all their screen time, they're was virtually no reason to care about her.\n\nI really want to know how they got season two so wrong.",

Season 1 had a more diverse room, Season 2 legit was all white guys. Season 1 seemed more willing to swing into the crazy, which easily could be explained be a more diverse room with a lot more to prove. Season 2 went back to standard TV tropes, which did not mesh well with the foundation laid\n\nNo matter what your personal opinions on diversity initiatives may be, broad perspectives help keep things interesting. Narrowing that was likely a mistake",

You want a variety of writers- not necessarily just marginalized groups, but at least coming from different backgrounds and experiences; that's how you avoid falling into old, tired tropes like it seemed season 2 seemed to do. They couldn't just let the boogeyman be the boogeyman- he had to have a sympathetic backstory, for example, something you see a lot in TV. Add in minority writers have more of a reason right now to take risks and distinguish themselves, and you really have a better room by making sure you have different backgrounds and experiences. Finding something unique is how you create a show people remember, and that first season really had that magic. The second season seems like it replaced them with more \"experienced\" writers- which meant a bunch of similar guys retreading what they had experienced as working in the past, not thinking outside the box. At least, that's what the end product suggested",

The thorniness of the leads and their differences in height and their  differences in acting styles all added to keeping the show wonderfully off-kilter in the first season. \n\nWe have seen and heard this sort of thing before. In Moonlighting, with Shepherd &amp; Willis, in Remington Steele, with Zimbalist &amp; Brosnan, and on X Files with Anderson and Duchovny, the tensions between the leads pulling off an hourlong show week after week led to huge onset drama. If the book was well-researched and thorough, perhaps it would bring these examples up to contrast and compare before making bold assertions without context.",

Including Campbell becoming \u201cunproductively\u201d emotional and defensive at times when Black writers made suggestions around elements of the scripts, potential unconscious bias being addressed by HR in terms of script assignments and fans criticizing the show for its treatment of Beharie\u2019s character.\n\nAnd this:\n\n&gt;It was a \u201cdouble standard\u201d as co-star Orlando Jones described it, with another source sensing she felt alone. \u201cEspecially if that person is a woman and a woman of color \u2014 those are two groups that already have challenges to begin with,\u201d that same source told Ryan.\n\nBoth of these are examples of jumping to a conclusion that racism played a role when there's no reason to think that this had anything to do with race.  This was both from Maureen Ryan (the author of the book that the article is based off of) and another \"unnamed source\" claiming that the \"racism\" was due to challenges that are innate aspects of being a \"woman of color,\" and I'm guessing this person isn't a sociologist and is just coming to this conclusion based on nothing more than their own opinion. Maureen Ryan wrote the book after she had already come to the conclusion that the industry treats women of color differently (which isn't how anyone studying racism would actually approach the subject), and yet the best she can come up with is people who \"assume\" the poor treatment was due to race/racism, but it sounds like everyone was having a bad time on the set.  This piece just seems to focus on how it was bad for Nicole Beharie, and Beharie doesn't even corroborate it!  It's an unbelievably thin argument to make.",

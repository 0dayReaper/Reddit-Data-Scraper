I think Trump &amp; Murdoch had a big hand in ruining the media.

Principal killed that one. And the district superintendent killed my story about the surprising lack of enforcement against certain graduating seniors who vandalized people's cars and caused all kinds of uproarus hell in the last couple of months before graduation. Apparently some of them were connected enough that the mayor got word and made it a no-go.\n\nThat would become a bit of a problem at some City Council meetings (much of the council was made up of church members who were always interested in our exploits)...

I say might because I am not sure the exact style guide but I bet it looks very similar to the NYTs which also uses the word Mister for leaders like this.",

He also continued to bring on round table hosts who were \"good tv\" but generally shitty at being experts on anything.\n\nNBC and CBS are terrified to put someone on that actually will push-back and dispute things politicians are saying.  It's not like he's limited to 40 minutes a week like 10 years ago.  He gets plenty of time during the week so he could very easily push an interview from 6 minutes to 9 minutes without causing his show any harm.  They just would prefer to push viewership and ratings the easy way.",

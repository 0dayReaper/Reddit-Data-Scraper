Like there are lots of ways a show can go \"eh\" but rarely have I seen so much focus on \"seriously, why in the fuck did they think that was a good resolution or a good story to follow?\"",

Especially how Roy and Jamie's relationship develops. I like Sam's journey as well. I enjoyed most of Rebecca's arc but Amsterdam fling and the whole pregnancy fortune teller bullshit felt unnecessary. I liked Ted's journey for the most part. Didn't like the fact that Ted left Richmond left. Made no sense to me.\n\nThe worst parts were that their choice to redeem Nate. I think everyone hated him by the end of S2. His redemption attempt felt rushed. He didn't nearly get punished enough for his actions to be fully redeemed as he was. I didn't like Keeley's journey at all this season. Break up of Keeley and Roy made no sense. And this season, they made it worse by the end with her being involved with her boss and breaking up and then back to Roy sorta but then Jamie again likes her back and they fight for her and again no answers. What was the point of all that?\n\nI just wish they handled the whole season well and ended in a way it made sense to the characters. We didn't need episodes to be an hour long.",

There's no dramatic tension when it's just \"Nate gets to decide when he's forgiven for all the horrible shit he did.\" \n\n\nLike we had a whole plot point asking Ted to own his anger when he's wronged.  Like it's okay to be pissed that your ex dated your fucking *marriage counselor.*  But then instead of doing anything with it, Ted and Nate \"reuniting\" is an afterthought because Nate's entire plotline happened in his childhood bedroom and all the players went from \"violently angry about the sign to the point of risking their health and careers as well as the opposing team's\" to \"We agreed unanimously that we want you back!\"",

We see Rebecca all season struggling with the gap between how much she wants to punish Rupert and how fundamentally decent she finds Ted to be. Considering that and the *massive* mitigating circumstances, Ted forgiving her makes sense.  Now with Nate, we just kinda see him explor why he feels bad about himself, no real focus on what an utter piece of shit he is.  For some reason his manic pixie dream girl who he likes, presumably, because she's pretty and works at a restaurant he likes starts to date him becuase, presumably, she saw another girl be mean to him.  Then he plays violin and is forgiven. \n\n\nIt's not that Nate is beyond redemption.  It's that no part of his \"forgiveness\" cycle involved actually engaging with what he did wrong, much less apologizing for it in any meaningful way. When he finally does actually say sorry it's an after thought because everyone was already back to besties.\n\n\nRebecca's arc was realizing that in her quest to hurt Ruper she was hurting a lot of good people along the way, feeling that pain, and apologizing for it.  Nate's was \"well I guess my dad always loved me, and it turns out Ruper wants me to cheat on Jade, so I'm forgiven.\" Between the show never giving Ted any agency or ability to stand up for himself, Nate being painfully self involved and the rest of the cast being muppets, the show basically just wants to forget that Nate wasn't just having a confidence crisis, he fucking leaked someone's mental health issues to the press out of spite.",

Nate's arc was going from hating himself and craving admiration and fame to loving himself and craving human connection. He got there by getting his dream job and realizing it was worthless without the family he'd made at Richmond. He got there by finding a woman who showed him he's not impossible to love for the person he is. He got there by realizing he should have been seeking connection with his father instead of praise. I don't think his journey had anything to do with needing to prove himself to Richmond for forgiveness. He's part of their family and he screwed himself. He has to learn to forgive himself, and that's all.",

                    "comment": "I\u2019ve enjoyed S3 too, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some kinda giant fall from grace. I think the tone, pace, and general quality of the series is pretty much identical to Season 1. The difference being that a slightly cheesy, hokey, feel-good show in Season 1 felt like a breath of fresh air - I mean it really felt like we hadn\u2019t seen *anything* like Ted Lasso on TV for a long while; by Season 3, we realise it\u2019s still cheesy. That\u2019s all.\n\nIt was never a realistic show. People complaining about characters behaviour should remember that the whole premise from day one was a completely unqualified American Football high school coach suddenly became coach of a major UK soccer team. \n\nMost characters are actually drawn as a sort of caricature. Think Coach Beard - from day one largely played for laughs. Think Leslie Higgins and his literal gurning for the camera. This is not some serious drama, and it hasn\u2019t been since day one. It\u2019s supposed to take you through feel-good moments, and it does this extremely successfully. It is pulled off because the script is witty, the cast are uniformly excellent, because it has plenty of heart in Rebecca Walton and Keeley Jones, because the team are a loveable bunch of misfits, because Anthony Head is good at playing a sleazy, caricature of a villain, and it had the surprise magic of Roy Kent. \n\nIt\u2019s an ensemble show done well - but season 3 does exactly what season 1 and season 2 did, and I\u2019m surprised people seem surprised and disappointed. For me - I know exactly what to expect tuning into Ted Lasso, and it hasn\u2019t once disappointed me; and indeed Season 3 has had some of the best episodes of the series. Zava is entertaining; Trent Crimm in the office is great fun as is his storyline with Colin; Sunflowers (Amsterdam) is an all round excellent episode of ANY TV show, ranks as a great episode; The Strings that Bind Us with the restaurant is a great episode; and La Locker Room aux Folles similarly is an excellent episode that deals with an obvious topic in a sensitive, warm but not heavy-handed manner. \n\nI think the fact that we have had about two seasons worth of Ted Lasso not actually really do any coaching at all, speaks volumes about what the show is about; but it also speaks volumes about Ted\u2019s place in this extremely strong ensemble - ie that the show could *easily* survive without him should they wish to continue the story. And that\u2019s not a bad thing.\n\nAt the same time - as it\u2019s a show set in football, inherently there is a *lot* of tension built into the \u201cwill they win or will they lose\u201d narrative. It\u2019s there even when the show desperately deliberately avoids it as \u201cimportant\u201d - whether they win or lose is the backdrop to the series and affects the emotional tone of every episode. In reality, like *actual* football (or other sports), this is ultimately **boring.** They will either win, or they will lose; and you can repeat that battle only so many times before it becomes the dullest thing in the world.\n\nFor this reason I think the show is quite limited; if it remains a \u201cfootball\u201d show, it will always be boring, because continuous sport is inherently boring (from a \u201cdrama\u201d point of view.\u201d)",

It isn't about what you \"need,\" and it's goofy as Hell to get angry at reviews because they agree.  Like do you go on Rotten Tomatoes, see a movie with a 8% rating and get pissed at all the reviews for saying similar things? Do you ever wonder what people mean when they say a show is \"well reviewed?\" \n\n\nJust the usual Redditor \"if this isn't for me it shouldn't exist!\" Should just two or three people review a show and any reviewer who didn't get it out early say \"shucks\" and wait for the next show?",

            "comment": "Things this season fucked up:\n\n\u25cf The entire tone of the show. There's lots of sesame street comparisons and I think they ring true. So many antidotes about doing the right thing that it feels like there's no real conflict in the show ever, which any good story needs. Also the corny jokes used to be tasteful and more sparse, now we can't escape them.\n\u25cf pretty much every character arc. Ted needed to grow some more self respect and allow himself to be upset when he discoverd his ex wife was dating their marriage counselor, but instead he just handles it the same way he always does as if he never went to therapy the previous season. Keeley's story arc was entirely unnecessary in s3. And don't get me started with Nate. They had a chance to make such an excellent villain out of Nate and they fumbled it from the very first episode. They really fucked his story up. Also, they spent a ton of time getting making the team members bigger characters even though they really didn't have much to add. I think the locker room discussions and silly events were a lot of the worst moments of this season. They could've curbed those scenes and made time for their stronger characters.\n\u25cf The episodes were way too damn long for nothing interesting to happen. The pivot to hour long episodes was such a mistake. Shows that the show really really lost track of what it was.\n\u25cf Instead of focusing on our old favorite characters (especially noticeable is the lack of the title character throughout the season) they introduced so many meaningless new characters. Give me one good reason why they shouldn't have left Zava on the cutting room floor. He did absolutely nothing, served no purpose, detracted from the story and other characters. Other useless or uninteresting/improperly utilized new characters include Jack, the woman working more directly with Keeley, Keeley's model friend that she hires, Rebecca's love interest from Amsterdam (can't even remember their names), and Jade. While I guess many of these characters are somewhat important for the story at hand, I would argue that a different story without these characters that was more focused on the characters we've already grown to love would have been much better.\n\u25cf The show has become less and less about the actual sport. Last night my girl pointed out that the players weren't wearing shin guards during a game. We see more dance numbers at practice than actual training. It's like a satire at this point. Rather than showcasing the team working hard and getting better and Ted learning more about the sport, we're supposed to assume these things have happened behind closed doors. I think this is the biggest thing they did wrong. They had a story, and the personal and interpersonal stuff should have more or less ended at s2. S3 should have been about them training and trying to win it all. It should've been about the sport and the rivalry with West Ham. That would have been a great ending to the series.\n\nIf there's anything I've forgotten please remind me. But this season was straight ass and it makes me so so sad because I really did like the first 2.",

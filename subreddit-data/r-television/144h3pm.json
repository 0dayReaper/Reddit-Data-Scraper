                            "comment": "Infinity War and Endgame are style over substance.\n\nThe basic trick of the films is to first pretend that they're separate movies, instead of Part One and Part Two of the same thing.\n\nOnce you get through that trick, what you see is that they systematically dismantled the Thor storyline in order to gaslight the audience into ignoring that what Thor does in Infinity War is the exact same shit that made him unworthy in Thor. This would be fine if they commit to the bit. But they don't. So, instead of Thor's getting a speech about how worthiness is a crock of shit and not taking Mjolnir, Thor gets the speech and still takes it. Endgame sort of gets away with it, but Thor Love and Thunder had to deal with the mess and it turns out they couldn't manage to reconcile the bizarre storytelling.\n\nSimilarly, let's talk about Hulk. Or, rather, let's talk about the increasingly delusional interviews the Russos have given about these movies. Like, these guys are literally saying Marvel's equivalents of \"wizards used to shit on the floor\" and no-one really noticed, except people who were already complaining about how they tried to tell basically a whole Hulk movie offscreen. Like, most of these problems are really writing complaints (as is the case with 99% of criticisms about films), but the Russos were in charge of directing the film and it's the direction that created the impression Hulk was scared.\n\nBut the thing is that these criticisms are actually visible in their other MCU work. Have you ever heard the idea that Whedon doesn't get Captain America? Honestly, I think that's a delusional take... Captain America is not Superman, even the main continuity isn't *actually* a paragon character (read an X-Men or a Runaways comic). However, the main thing is that people who say this claim that the Russos \"fixed\" MCU Cap. What this actually means is that they ignored prior characterisation (like they did with Thor and Hulk, and Loki) and substituted what they wanted to do instead.\n\nWhat we're looking at is a body of work by a creative team (the Russos, Markus and McFeely) who have routinely demonstrated a tendency to make bad choices, that just so happened to work out. People who have bad ideas will generally tend to keep having bad ideas. I prefer to blame M&amp;M, but maybe the evidence is suggesting they were good little soldiers implementing poor takes by the Russos.",

They're just showing their weekness and instead Kevin Feige's strength: creativity and storytelling. The Russo bros are great directors, they just suck at the writing/creative part of the job. Their Marvel movies were great cause Marvel literally has a parliament of people whose sole job is to worry about crafting the best story possible ans making it fit within the larger frame of the MCU. Now that the Russos are out on their own, they no longer have this creative support system..and it shows.",

            "comment": "Man, I was really high on Richard Madden after The Bodyguard. Like, the first 10-15min of that series was absolutely electric. As I remember, it was mostly just RM looking worried, and then trying to **not** look worried in front of the kids he was with, *and then* getting more and more worried as shit was going south, but trying to keep it together for the kids...\n\nAnd I was totally mesmerized - terrific performance, with a lot of vulnerability and compassion, and an amazing showcase for dude's talents. I found the rest of the series pretty \"meh\" but I was left with the distinct impression that Richard Madden was **The Real Deal** and a bona fide star, and he that was destined for bigger/better things.\n\nI (mostly) watched Citadel and... It's kind of hard to remember what it was that I liked about Richard Madden.\n\nI was *aware* of who Priyanka Chopra-Jonas is, but Citadel was my first time *really* seeing her in something, so I was kind of looking forward to assessing her acting ability/star-power... And... I was not particularly impressed - I have no idea how/why she got to be where she is today. She wasn't *bad*, exactly... just ... there, I guess?\n\nIn sports terms, I feel like this has got to be bad coaching. I think Richard Madden has talent, I'm assuming Priyanka does too... I feel like these are talented stars who are being misused in a scheme that doesn't play to their strengths.\n\nAlso, the material just isn't that good. There isn't a whole lot there for them to work with.\n\nAnyway, I hope Richard Madden finds the right project... Something that plays to his strengths, and makes him into a big star. Not because he seems like a nice guy or anything, but because I want to be proven correct as an evaluator of talent/star-power LOL.",

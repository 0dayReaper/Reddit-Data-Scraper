    "postText": "Last week I tried to attempt a quiz but realised it closed at 5pm instead of 11:59pm. Usually I complete the quizzes earlier in the week but I was focusing on 2 tests that weighed 50% for their units. Plus it was only open from Wednesday to Friday.\n\nThe quiz was only worth 10% but the unit outline states that I have to attempt all assessments in order to pass. Is there anything I can do to work around this or am I doomed to fail the unit?",

I\u2019m hoping that all 3 quizzes count as 1 assignment as  the outline has them under \u201cQuizzes\u201d worth 50%. However, I\u2019m not sure how to find out if this is the case.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently a Year 12 student and I really aspire to study medicine. I really can't see myself doing any other course other than med. I will be sitting the UCAT in 2 months but the main issue for me is that I currently don't have the ATAR (nowhere near the 90s) as i didn't put in the effort that I should've and I am extremely bummed about it and regret it very much.  \nI just want some info on what i should be doing moving forward and how i can reach my dream.  \n\n\n1. Can I please get more info on what I need to do to switch courses after joining next year?  \n2. What are the requirements when switching?  \n3. Can I switch into medicine from any course (for example Engineering)?  \n4. Will I need to do GAMSAT or can I use my UCAT score?  \n\n\nIf anyone could help and provide me with some information, it would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "You probably already know that you can\u2019t go straight into medicine anymore, you need to do a science bachelors before going in (bio-med, preclinical, human bio or similar). Aim first for one of those courses, see how you do, then consider medicine. Those high ATARs for medicine are there for a reason, so without exceptional circumstances, you might need to look into a bridging course first.",

The website says i can switch into the med course after completing atleast 200 credits with a minimum CWA of 80 or higher, have a minimum of 200 credits remaining in the course at the end of the year, complete UCAT and meet Chem ATAR. I am a little confused.",

Curtin is an outlier in this, but it has incredibly stringent requirements. I\u2019m also a little confused because, from your own admission, you\u2019re unlikely to get a minimum ATAR of 95, so another separate bridging course may be in your future, too. You seem to be thinking way too far ahead. You might benefit from going to a Curtin open day to ask these questions directly.",

I do Human Bio as a ATAR subject and even though i'm not scoring the marks i really would like, i really do find it interesting and have a strong interest in the medicine field. I've always wanted to help others, hence i have a strong passion for medicine. My other career option would be engineering, but i personally feel like it isn't for me and i reckon everyone i know is doing it. I really just hate myself for not trying this year and working to the best of my abilities. I don't want to give up my dream and really want to push for medicine so I'm extremly certain i'll put the work in if i just get the assurance from someone that I still have a chance next year. I just really want to know what i can do for next year and what i have to do to be able to course switch into medicine.",

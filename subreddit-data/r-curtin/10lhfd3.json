My partner wants to take a trip in march but uni will be on so I'm unsure if it's feasible to do both (I'm doing a double degree and only 1/2 is available online). Do I just accept this is something I will have to miss out on or can I do both?",

If your partner is considerate they could plan another holiday with you when you are on break (uni is only 30 weeks /year?)  Prioritise you and be careful of FOMO temptation at uni. You can holiday whenever you like in break/after grad.",

Probably fine.\n3-4 your stretching it\n4+ consider taking the semester off or dropping to part time units.\n\nYou can probably catch up with the course notes when you get back no problem.\n\nThe other thing to think about is if you can enjoy the holiday and not ruin for yourself thinking about uni.\n\nAs someone who is older, finished uni and has a heap of responsibilities at work, my advice would be to enjoy the days you have with lack of responsibilities while you have them. \n\nI need to take over a week off to make it worthwhile - a few days just leaves me with too much of a backlog of work to complete that isn't worth handing over.\n\nDon't take that as a negative sentiment, as life isn't worse, it's just different.",

You will only disadvantage yourself and holidays arent that important during uni",

            "comment": "There's a few variables here.\n\n1) What exact classes you have and their attendance requirements. If you're doing a course that has practical classes like lab sessions then you really can't be missing out on those. Even tutorials if attendance isn't compulsory it's better to attend them cause you usually go into the material in more depth which helps for assignments and exams\n\n2) Speaking of assignments, what is the assessment schedule for your unit? Will there be assignments due around that time? Are there regular assessments like quizzes or lab/tutorial exercises that get graded? Or are there skills in things like lab sessions that might get assessed at the end of semester in a lab exam? If you're gonna miss out on easy marks from turning up and doing classwork or compromise your ability to complete assignments I wouldn't go\n\n3) Just how much of a self-motivated learner are you? Some people can miss a week of classes and absolutely blitz it to catch up. A lot of us say we're gonna do it and never really do. If you're someone who struggles to motivate themselves to go back and catch up on stuff you missed, I'd turn up as it gives you the best chance of learning what you need to know.\n\nAs others have pointed out, you might get away with a very short weekend trip early on but other than that I would be asking my partner to wait and go at a time when uni isn't on. Besides, a trip won't be very fun for you if you're stressing about what you might be missing at uni the whole time",

I take a 10-14 day trip in August every year to places with 0 reception and have always made it work (handed in a few assignments weeks early etc.) But it depends on what courses you are doing, when you have assignments due, your own ability to keep up and how long you go for. \nIt is 100% doable in a lot of cases you just need to get really on top of everything and be prepared to not do anything but uni stuff for a week after you get back so you don't end up behind. And also talk to your teachers the first week of semester so you can work out what you would be missing out on",

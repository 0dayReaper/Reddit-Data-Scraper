As with all units, you get better grades depending on the effort put in. Humanities is big on class discussion, and being an active participant in class helps with your understanding of the unit learning.",

            "comment": "I don't do any of the subjects you mentioned, but I am a UniReady student, not sure how helpful or useless this will be, but here goes.\n\nBasically I'd say the work is usually easy enough, but the workload is high. And the workload will vary by subject. I take Maths for Science, the workload is a lot. For my other subjects, the workload is usually low, but when assessments come, it's high.\n\nOne other thing. One mistake I've done in Uniready is to focus on my work every week, and cram my assessments (the ones I work on and submit) close to when they're due. So I often end up going a few hours without sleep to get my assignments done the day before or two days before the deadline.\n\nI don't know if this will fix my problems, but what I plan on doing so far is to work on my assesments bit by bit, day by day, a few weeks before the deadline. Hopefully I won't have to cram everything in. I recommend you to try the same.",

Pretty interesting and easy, but make sure you stay on top of your assessments and do not procrastinate. Same as intro to commerce. \n\nI passed my UniReady and went straight to do my Bachelor's of Commerce.",

    "postText": "I was studying in Curtin Malaysia and it\u2019s not worth it. The campus is in the middle of a swamp and literally sinking. They charge so much from the international student but don\u2019t even give good services. The accommodation have dirty water and when I told the admin about this, they just told me to buy a water filter. Like aren\u2019t YOU supposed to provide me clean water. The housing department is the worst. You have to wait for weeks to get a reply from them. Sometimes they\u2019d ignore your emailed completely. They force you to live with 7 people in a small house a share one fridge. The accommodations are very poorly planned out. How do you expect 7 people to share a fridge (most of the people cook themselves). The only good thing I had in this uni were my lecturers. They were some of the nicest people I met. I think my department was considered lucky. Because I have countless people from the engineering or the business faculty saying their lecturers fail them on purpose. Apparently the management do this because they don\u2019t get enough students and they\u2019re not financially doing great. The school won\u2019t even remark you in most cases. I find this very messed up. The students are not or should not be responsible for the bad financial situation the uni is in. Overall it wasn\u2019t a good experience.",

Shared accommodation is similar situations to Perth, yes it might be smaller but guess why? It\u2019s not Australia, different standards and prices.\n\n3. I can\u2019t speak on Curtin Malaysia failing people on purpose, however I can say that engineering at Curtin Perth isn\u2019t easy and failing is expected. I even heard that use too (maybe still) make it more difficult to fail people and getting people to drop out. Take in a large amount of people with the expectation of large amounts of people dropping out. \n\n\nCurtin Malaysia isn\u2019t designed for Australians, it\u2019s designed for people can\u2019t afford to go to Australia and as such the conditions at Curtin Malaysia reflect that.",

Also, yes the tuition is more expensive compared to Australia but Curtin Malaysia is still expensive for international students if you look at the local level. And lastly about the engineering being hard I agree. However when the higher ups admitted to failing students on purpose it doesn\u2019t really reflect on how hard it is. It\u2019s about the administration being rigged",

International students being compared shows a different story.\n\nSources https://fees.curtin.edu.my/course-fee/course-2022/ and Curtin hand book\n\nAccording to Curtin an international student at Malaysia will pay $15,000/year and in Perth an international student will pay $37,000/year. These prices are for engineering.\n\nAlso note that local Malaysian pay approximately $10,000/year for the same course.\n\nSo yes it\u2019s cheaper then studying at Curtin Perth.\n\nAgain, it would be nice to have Australian standards at Curtin Malaysia, but it\u2019s not designed for Australians it\u2019s a reflection from the population who live there.",

    "postText": "Has anyone here done or is doing a Bachelor of Educational Studies? (Not a Bachelor of Education)\n\nI have previously started a Bachelor of Education (Primary) but had to drop out due to health issues, and am now looking into going back to uni next year. I dont want to continue what I was doing, but I do want to continue something in the education system, plus I should be able to get credit for a few of the units. Ive read the official uni info for a Bachelor of Educational Studies but I cant find anything from anyone who has actually done it and I'm just wondering what it's like, and if youve completed it what jobs youve got using the Bachelor?",

    "postText": "Just finished my final semester through OUA and internally on campus and grades are coming out by next week. Been pretty panicked so I've been monitoring the announcements to see when the grades come out and when i check to enrol in units it now shows 'potentially complete' as my status, when before it used to just say admitted. \n\nThis probably isn't a big deal but anyone got any idea what it means?",

If your marks/oua transcripts arent submitted and applied by the crl office to the grad office, you will not graduate in February and will have to wait til August. \n\nI have just been through the same thing, and required my faculty to apply to Uni SA for an early release of marks so i could graduate on feb 5",

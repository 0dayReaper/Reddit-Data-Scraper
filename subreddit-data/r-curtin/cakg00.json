    "postText": "hey all, in a kind of unique situation with my boyfriend who's studying at Curtin at the moment and am wondering if anyone can provide some insight. (yes, he's contacted the uni already but am hoping to get some other advice in the meantime)\n\nprior to coming to Australia, he studied about 10 units in the USA.\nhe came to Curtin for semester 2 2017 and the department were able to use those units to figure out what he did and didn't have to study while over here. he has been here on exchange ever since, having successfully completed 4 semesters so far, and is in the process of applying to graduate here next semester (he only has one unit left). he is about to transfer from a student visa to a bridging visa, as we have applied for his permanent residency under the partner visa.\n\nthe issue that has arisen is that Curtin does not seem to be accepting the 10 units he did in the USA as credit towards graduation in Australia, despite being the same course. he is really concerned that he's going to have to study for another year and a half to fulfil what's needed for an Australian graduation, having to take out a ridiculous amount of private student loans in the process (he's not eligible for HECS yet).\n\nI'd love to know what you all think - could this possibly be a mistake or are they really not going to accept all the study he did in the US? do you think we'd have a chance with the appeals process at all? \n\nthanks guys :(",

There's a possibility that they just didn't, for some reason. If that's the case, then you'd just need to submit that.\n\nI can't really imagine what else the issue could be, I don't think the university can renege on a CRL agreement.",

If not, then it's impossible to say. The same course is almost certainly not \"the same course\", it may have the same title but there will be a different curriculum. Honestly, I think your best bet is to stop playing the \"what if\" game and talk to the course coordinator about your concerns. There's no point getting worked up about the possibility of being rejected, it does not benefit you in any way",

Unless an articulation agreement exists with the degree/uni, then he won't get an answer on credit until a formal CRL application is assessed. \n\nHe should talk to the course coordinator. However he should allow a couple of weeks since submitting his CRL application. \n\nI believe there is a right of appeal and/or to revise/submit a new application.",

I think we were under the impression that the outcome of that would come along with his successful study application. he's since emailed the appropriate advisor/s so I'm sure we'll find out sooner or later. and yep there's an appeals process which I think he'll have a good chance of passing through in the case that they do reject his units.\n\nthank you for the tips, I really appreciate it :)",

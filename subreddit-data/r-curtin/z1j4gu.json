    "postText": "Hey, does anyone know if the academic standing changes in elsie when the cwa changes(If needed). Its been 4-5 days since my cwa changed and my academic standing remained the same (good standing). I know someone whose standing changed from conditional to good standing 2 semesters ago, when the cwa in elsie changed. Has anyone had there standing change after the cwa change that happened around 4 days ago, i.e. went from conditional to good standing or good standing to conditional. Just wanna know to see if it still changes, or if you'd only know once the final results are released.",

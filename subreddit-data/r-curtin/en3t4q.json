            "comment": "It's going to depend on the unit at the end of the day. Sometimes unit coordinators like to scare students by saying something is hard. I remember one of my UCs told us that the unit we would be taking in 3rd year was so hard that whatever you got in the pre requisite you should deduct 10%, and that will be your grade. It turned out to be one of the easiest units I've taken for my degree. They say these things to actually get you to study hard.\n\nGood luck!",

Wait until they take $100 out of every pay check.\n\nTo add to this: what do you have to lose? They only offered me sup exams when I had failed already. You literally have nothing to lose by trying.",

I think they only offer it twice, in your first year or last year of your uni. Btw, i passed it the second time around. Just make sure you study harder this time. :)",

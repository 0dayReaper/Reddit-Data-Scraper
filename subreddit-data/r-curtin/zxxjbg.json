    "postText": "Hi, I am thinking of applying for the Master of Teaching and I'm just wondering if anyone knows how the 'Special Study Periods\" work. I see they run for the whole year so I'm wondering if any study breaks apply or if the only break is you don't have any units for one of the 4 study periods. In that case is it possible to add more than 2 units to a study period? I can't really find anything about this on the website. Any info is helpful! Thanks.",

            "comment": "It's because they need to work in prac around units. Since school is when the uni semesters are on, they move some units so that you aren't trying to submit major assessments and do prac. If you look up the units for the course you might be able to sort out how many weeks of prac are in which periods.",

I\u2019m wondering in the sense of if I were to visit family overseas or travel. I guess I\u2019m just concerned even if the workload is low we have might have tutorials for the entire year. UWA and ECU have the more standard semester schedule so it\u2019s clearer. Thanks!",

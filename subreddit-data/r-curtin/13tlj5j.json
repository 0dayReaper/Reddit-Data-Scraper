It's also quoted arrest and charge details.\n\nWhether the allegations are true and can be proven is a different matter but no media outlet can print specific material like this if it was just a hatchet job. The police have also characterised dinner of three located material as cat 1 and 2, so this is not a trivial matter.\n\nBesides, it's hard for anyone to report anything more than the arrest and bail details until the evidence is produced in a courtroom (which will likely remain sealed for at least some of the trial)\n\nI think you're being a little harsh in this one.",

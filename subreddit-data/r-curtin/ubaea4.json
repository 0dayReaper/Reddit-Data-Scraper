    "postText": "I posted this on another thread but I'm going to post it here because this happened to me in Curtin.\n\nTwo people approach you and ask you to do a survey for an \"assignment\" and they ask you if you're a Christian. If you say yes they'll invite you to coffee then ask you to attend a Bible study group meeting thing. The group starts of with a small Bible study (1-3 people being taught by a teacher) that goes on for a few weeks. After that you'll be invited to take part in a bigger Bible study that will go on for 8-10 months. The Bible studies are every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday 9am or 7pm. They are quite strict on attendance; you can't miss a class without a \"valid\" reason if you miss a class because of work, uni, social obligations they'll say Satan is trying to deceive you, you're not taking the word of God seriously blah blah blah. You can't even be a few minutes late to class without a \"valid\" reason. They'll pair you with a friend (it a best bible buddy as they call them) so you can have an emotional connection with someone. As for the content, they teach that in order to gain salvation you need to understand all the parables (something you can only do in the open time) and that only they have the full understanding. Example of parables are women=pastor, leaf=evangelist, Tabernacle= copy and shadow of the kingdom of heaven, seed=word, Four contents of the Bible are history, teaching, prophecy and fulfilment. Everything they say they have a verse to back it up with and unless you're a Bible schoar it can be hard to refute their verses. Just remember that as a Christian salvation DOES NOT COME FROM UNDERSTANDING PARABLES (this is heretical) and ask yourself why they are so secretive about their name/denomination (if they were a legit Bible study there would be no reason for secrets) also remember the reason for their strictness in terms of attending classes, revisions and rewatches is to make sure you are brainwashed enough to accept their psycho leader Lee Man Hee or whatever as \"the One who Overcomes/the victorious one\". They'll also try and guilt trio you by saying you aren't taking God seriously by not prioritizing the Bible study and that the second coming is near so you need to be prepared. Jesus was quite clear, no one but God knows the hour or the day anyone who claims to have figured it out is a false teacher. Also it's not worth, giving up on social commitments, family time or study time for a Bible study. Please be wary, take care of yourself, seen psychological help if need be and if anyone approaches you asking you to take part in a \"survey\" and they ask if you're a Christian either say no or tell them that you've heard about a cult that goes around recruiting people like that lol.",

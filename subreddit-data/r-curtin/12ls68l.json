    "postText": "Hey peeps\n\nI (18M) am currently studying a bs of computing (computer science), but am very much thinking of switching. Not that the bs is bs, nor that I am not good at it, but I simply cannot imagine myself enjoying a programming job - this to me seems quite unfulfilling and tedious; sitting down all day writing code is a drab - although I am quite good at it, so I will continue this as a hobby / side-project.\n\nWhat I am looking for is a job with more purpose, engagement and fulfillment. For this reason I have become very interested in a career in medicine - especially within Ophthalmology, or Anaesthetics.\n\nHowever, a part of me feels like I should do business, because I would like to have some Ag startup - this also feels fulfilling. A project like this seems much larger than SaaS, however I don't mind hiring other people to run most of it for me should I pursue medicine - I would take the role of overseeing it broadly.\n\nYet still, I reckon I would greatly enjoy med and not business degree - because I would only like to run my own business. I am willing to spend at least a decade to have a job in Ophtho.\n\nANyway, I guess my question is: how is the med school culture? Do people party regularly? Do you feel like your wasting your 20s studying, or is that made up for by good student culture?\n\nMy apols for long message, I wouldn't call it a life *crisis*, but a life *evaluation*.",

            "comment": "Not quite answering your specific question, but as someone who has significant business experience and is currently a commerce student, doing an entire business degree purely for 1 specific start up idea is not a good plan.\n\nMost start ups fail, that\u2019s a fact. So unless you wish to be an ongoing entrepreneur or have a wider purpose behind a business degree, do not waste the investment of an entire degree for the sole purpose of a start up idea.\n\nMost small &amp; medium business owners don\u2019t have business qualifications. Most start ups don\u2019t either. \n\nPeople have a skill set their business is based on (e.g programming, carpentry, lawyer, etc) and they figure the business stuff out as they go and by paying for skilled advice, e.g accountants  or outsource portions e.g HR.\n\nYou don\u2019t do a business degree to start a business, you do a business degree to work in the corporate world or to improve your skill set for your existing, successful business. Yes there are exceptions and yes Curtin will try to sell anyone on their entrepreneurship commerce degree, but it\u2019s just not how the real world generally works.\n\nP.S you also don\u2019t generally have the option to \u201cjust pay someone else to run most of if\u201d for a new business unless you happen to have a free funding source of a few million laying around. New businesses don\u2019t make money in the first year, many don\u2019t in the second. You generally can\u2019t afford multiple salaries while not making money, cashflow is why most fail.",

            "comment": "As a Curtin med student: it\u2019s a LOT of study, yes. But compared to other med degrees, ours is 5 years so it doesn\u2019t really feel like you\u2019re wasting your life away. After med school you have an intern year (you are a doctor and you get paid) and after that you select your program (minimum 4 years full time). So you are still learning after the 5 years, but you are employed. \n\nIn terms of the culture, I won\u2019t lie, there are some points in the semester where the collective thought is \u201cwhy did we sign up for this?\u201d But then you go on a placement and maybe make a patient\u2019s day better and it all feels worth it. \n\nAt the end of the day, we are getting older anyway. Might as well be 30 and a doctor (if that\u2019s what you want) after spending your 20\u2019s studying and working, rather than being 30 and 7 years into a career you don\u2019t want. \n\nIn saying all of that, there are plenty of careers that can provide fulfilment. Even within healthcare, being an optometrist, nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, pharmacist\u2026 these careers all can provide that. Have a think about what it is specifically about medicine you\u2019d prefer. Is it the deduction required for diagnoses? Is it the higher order decision making under pressure? Is it the flexibility of the job? Really think about your options, because there are other ways to achieve fulfilment. However, if there are things about med specifically you\u2019d prefer- go for it. Or you\u2019ll spend your whole life wondering \u201cwhat if?\u201d \n\nBest of luck! If you\u2019re looking to apply this year, make sure you check out the UCAT deadlines.",

    "postText": "I am an Egyptian student at Curtin University Dubai. Yesterday, I asked the Egyptian ministry of education if they accredit or accept Curtin Dubai certificates, and they said no, they don't accept them. Then I contacted the KDHA and the ministry of education of UAE. They told me the Curtin university Dubai certificate is only accepted in Dubai as an emirate and in Australia. So I tried to move to Wollongong, but they don't accept my credits for the same reason, so I talked with an Admission officer. He said that when we graduate, we will take the certificate from the main campus of Australia, and it won't mention Dubai on it. So please confirm it or tell me more details about it because if I take the certificate from Dubai, it will be a huge problem. The military service will give me three years instead of one, and   I won't be able to open a company, work, or even get a passport from Egypt. It will destroy my life, so please give me more details about it. He also said it is the same for other branches like Malaysia and Singapore.",

Find out what credits you need to study in Australia and get them from Dubai. Curtin Perth should accept credits from its own institutions.",

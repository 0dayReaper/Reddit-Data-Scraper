I\u2019ve enrolled in two units (50 credits - is this allowed? I work full time so can only study part time). I click on the unit outline and there is nothing there about to start dates, how the course is structured in terms of any lectures or assignments. \n\nI feel lost using oasis - it\u2019s such a weird system to navigate. I wouldn\u2019t even know who to contact about whether I have enrolled in the correct units or enough units - there is no easy contact info and the contact help link is broken",

Did all that, had my schedule changed, then in WEEK 2 after cancelling the class in week one, the lecturer announced the unit would be done as a two week block intensive type thing. But still couldn't tell us when. \n\nWhile I actually would have preferred that because I could just take annual leave then and work normal hours the rest of the time, my work needed about 4 months notice for leave at least and even then only if it was under the cap. Safe to say, I had to drop the unit, plus now I had weird work hours to work around lectures I wasn't attending.......",

That is done via estudent first and you select time slots there.\n\nThere\u2019s no info for unit outlines or on unit pages till closer to the semester start, all units (with the exception of some med school stuff I think) start and follow the same weekly structure, you can see the start dates by Google searching for Curtin academic calendar and the main semester info.\n\nFor example: you enroll in a class on Wednesday\u2019s at 3pm, the academic calendar teaching start date this semester is Monday the 27th of February. Therefore, your first class will be on Wednesday the 29th and weekly following until the teaching period ends before exams.\n\nHope that helps, feel free to send me a message if you have more questions, I\u2019m also mature aged student who returned to uni and had to wrap my head around things",

My course has had many unit changes and never any contact from them regarding it and very poor response times to my questions at the times as well, you basically have to figure it out yourself. The only good part is there is also not really any wrong way to do it, generally at least.",

As long as you're enrolled (check in eStudent/My Enrolments), you should be fine.\n\nGo to Oasis/My Studies/My Units for links to the unit outlines. Click the Handbook links on each unit (the title links don't work) to get the outline. Once published on Blackboard each unit will have a reading list with the books you need to buy/borrow.\n\nWhen classes begin, you'll be doing most of your interaction via Blackboard. In my experience, content for the semester is generally broken down in the Blackboard menu so you can plan and review as needed. Online unit lectures are done in Collaborate and generally recorded and available within a couple of hours of the live lecture so while it's preferable to be there \"live\", it's usually fine to watch later. Obv, you don't get the opportunity to query the tutor doing it that way if you don't understand anything.\n\nAssignment submissions are done via Turnitin (specific links provided in Blackboard).\n\nGood luck. Don't stress - that comes later when you have multiple assignments due and Turnitin is chucking a wobbly :-)\n\nsource: 52yo in second year this year.",

I too am a 30 something year old student and it's a different way of learning and you're definitely not spoon fed like in school or Tafe. It's up to you to keep an eye on dates for assessments etc and a lot is self learned through tutorial material.

Would anyone like to be an interviewee?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe interview will be twenty minutes long and consist of ten questions regarding your walking your dog or someone else's dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am available anytime after 12 p.m. AEDT on the 3rd of this month and will most likely respond to comments after 11 a.m. AEDT because of my horrid sleep schedule.\n\nEdit: I have interviewed four individuals and currently looking for a fifth interviewee.\nEdit 2: I have interviewed the required number of individuals and will not be looking for anymore. Thanks everyone.",

Although I have twelve questions, only ten are required to be answered; two additional questions in this list exist in case one wishes not to answer one or more of the others. The questions are:\n\n1.\tWould you please describe your favourite characteristics of the paths you walk your dog on?\n\n2.\tHow do you feel about technology being involved with your walking your dog?\n\n3.\tHow often and how far do you walk your dog?\n\n4.\tBy what methods do you usually figure out your walking route for the day?\n\n5.\tWould you tell me about the earliest time you can recall walking a dog?\n\n6.\tDo you focus on only walking your dog during a walk, or do you focus on other things while walking as well?\n\n7.\tWhat steps do you take to prepare for walking your dog?\n\n8.\tDo you talk to other people while you walk your dog?\n\n9.\tWhat weathers do you prefer for walking?\n\n10.\tRegarding phone apps, do you prefer in-depth customisability and a wide breadth of choice, or do you prefer high-speed and efficient decision with fewer choices making?\n\n11.\tIf something like an app doesn\u2019t work the first or first few times or perform the way you want it to, but might if you continue trying, what would you do?\n\n12.\tBefore you go, would you be alright with stating gender and giving brief background details in the form of your occupation title and socioeconomic status?\n\nIn the post, I also forgot to mention the interviews will be online and audio only, will require a consent form to be signed (typing one's name in it is satisfactory), and that this is for an app design assignment in DIG11 UX Design. Please, send me a direct message if you are still interested.",

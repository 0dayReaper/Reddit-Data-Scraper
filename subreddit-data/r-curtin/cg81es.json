    "postText": "Do you use social media? \n\nA redundant question, but why do I ask? \n\nI am doing a research study to see if quitting social media for a week affects wellbeing. If you\u2019re interested and have an iPhone/Android phone, more info on the study can be found under the heading \"STUDY INFO\"\n\nIf you know people who may be interested in this research study, let them know too! \n\nThis study has been approved by the Curtin HREC Ethics Committee (HREC number HRE2017-0060).\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n== STUDY INFO ==\n\nHREC Project Number: HRE2017-0060\nProject title: Individual differences in verbal and visual processing of valenced and neutral information, and its relation to behaviour\nPrincipal Investigator: Dr. Patrick Clarke\nStudent researchers: Chester Ma\nVersion Number: V1.1\nVersion date: 1.05.2019\n\nThis research program is being carried out by investigators working under the supervision of Dr Patrick Clarke, within Curtin University\u2019s School of Psychology. The purpose of the research is to examine verbal and visual information processing and behaviour in people who vary widely in terms of their normal emotional experiences.\nIf you choose to participate in this experiment, you first will be invited to complete several questionnaires which may ask you to report to report your emotional feelings in general or certain behaviour. You will also be asked to access data via your smartphone regarding your application and phone usage for the experimenter to record. For iPhone users this data is automatically captured, while for Android users you will need to download the following App Usage application (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a0soft.gphone.uninstaller&amp;hl=en_AU) one week prior to attending the study so this information can be captured. The information we record will include details such as average time spent using social media applications and total phone use over the past week.\n\nYou then will be given a computer task which involves making simple decisions concerning visual material. Some of the information presented in this task may have a mild emotional tone, which can be slightly pleasant or unpleasant, but all the stimuli will be similar to that appearing on a daily basis within the popular media. Your right to terminate your participation in this study can be freely exercised without prejudice and without the need to provide reason or justification.\nAt the end of the session, you may also be asked to suspend your social media accounts in the week before your next session. This would include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Reddit accounts, and you will also be asked to temporarily delete these apps from your phone. You will be asked to refrain from using these until after your next session.\n\nFor this study we are also seeking student\u2019s approval to access exam grades. If you consent, we will seek to obtain your score on the exam from the relevant School or Faulty. Your score on the exam will be de-identified and stored anonymously. You can indicate your willingness for us to access your exam results on the consent form.\nThe test session will take less than an hour to complete. Following this session you may be asked to again complete subsequent sessions involving measures as detailed above at a time of your convenience as arranged with the experimenter. Your questionnaire data, the speed and accuracy of your responses on the computer task, as well any eye movement or heart rate data will be securely coded, and stored separately from identifying information, which also will be held\nsecurely.\n\nYour participation in this study does not prejudice any right to compensation, which you may have under statute or common law. Please be aware that participation in this study is entirely voluntary. If you do decide to take part, then you remain free at any time to withdraw from the study, without prejudice and without the need to provide reason or justification. Should you choose to withdraw, then records of your participation will be destroyed, unless otherwise agreed. Upon completion of the research, the collected information concerning questionnaire responses, the speed and accuracy of responses on the computer task, and eye movement data, will be securely stored and will be kept strictly confidential. It will not be released unless the investigator is required to do so by law. These data will be used to produce research reports, in the form of\ntheses and/or scientific papers. No names or identification information will be used in any report written about the study.\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask either the experimenter now, or for further details later using the contact details provided below.\nCurtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) has approved this study (HREC number HRE2017-0060). Should you wish to discuss the study with someone not directly involved, in particular, any matters concerning the conduct of the study or your rights as a participant, or you wish to make a confidential complaint, you may contact the Ethics Officer on (08) 9266 9223 or the Manager, Research Integrity on (08) 9266 7093 or email hrec@curtin.edu.au.\n\nStudent researcher: Chester Ma\njianhao.ma@student.curtin.edu.au\n\nProject Supervisor: Patrick Clarke\npatrick.clarke@curtin.edu.au",

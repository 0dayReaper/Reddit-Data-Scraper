If you haven\u2019t been to a mine before and gotten a feel of the environment (long hours, a week or more away from home per fortnight, different cultures etc) I\u2019d hope you think about this carefully because some really do not like it. At the end you could have a degree that\u2019s really only applicable to a field you don\u2019t love. I think you could study civil engineering and end up doing similar/the same work as some of the mining engineers but have flexibility to go into construction.\n\nThere\u2019s other disciplines of engineering that will get you up there as well. Mechanical or electrical engineering could open a lot of doors to the process plants or vehicle maintenance side. I\u2019ve been in mining for almost 4 years on the back of a chemical engineering degree looking after various processing plants across WA. You could also study metallurgy to go this pathway. Just think about what area attracts you to mining to help point you in the right direction. \n\nI didn\u2019t go to Curtin but it could be worthwhile to go to a uni open day or talk to someone from WA School of Mines. Typically they\u2019ll love talking to high schoolers interested in the field :)",

Look at graduate entry level all the way up to management to get a sense of what's required. I'd guess that there would be need for nearly all types of engineers in mining so you would just need to find the one that appeals to you",

Usually, to breach that number you will have to go to the mines to make more.\n\nAnyway, after looking through the engineering courses you didn't consider *mining* engineering as possibly the best engineering choice to get into mining?\n\nFinally, whatever your choice, avoid doing a double degree.",

That's 70-80k lost because you were studying instead of working. \n\nFuthermore, your future employer probably won't know how to best use your niche combination of skills, so one degree will win over in the end.\n\nBut there is some value in being able to get a taste of more lines of work. It might solve some conflicts you may have as to what you want to do.\n\nJust finally, dont do any Commerce/engineering double.",

However, half of the people I know that started the double ended up dropping to a single degree out of the two that were offered in the double.\n\nIf you are considering mechatronics engineering, then this is the only case where I'd actually say the double degree with comp sci is a good choice - mechatronics engineers struggle to find work or lack the software development skills to get work in their field.\n\nAgain, don't forget that comp sci is a 3 year degree. A Eng+CS degree is 5 years. That's 2 years you miss out on making money if you end up leaning towards the computer science pathway over the engineering one. When you land your first job, there's a 95% chance you will only be using one of your degrees - the other degree is effectively wasted.\n\nAs for the workload - a double degree is still 100 credits per semester. The workload is similar. You would find that engineering is a moderate workload with highly abstract concepts, whereas comp sci is a high workload with straightforward concepts. You will need to learn to balance this as you find your personal strengths and weaknesses.",

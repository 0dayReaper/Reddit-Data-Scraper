You can start anytime but I would suggest to start as early as possible since you will stay longer at university due to the bridging course. In saying that, I have limited knowledge regarding your experience at tafe. They may take that into account and you could possibly do less time doing the bridging course or maybe not do it at all.",

After achieving this, you can do a bridging course that will lead you to officially do engineering. This will typically take about a year. \n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure about the units you will need to complete in order to transition into engineering, but taking a look at the curtin handbook is a good first step. I will look more into it and try to give you more information.\n\nIn regards to your friend, I\u2019m not sure I can totally answer that. It\u2019s best if you ask them specifically about how they were able to do as you have said.",

If you apply through open Universities you have all the Curtin benefits plus you will receive another 10 free study help sessions per study period.

            "comment": "Completion of UniReady unfortunately won't qualify you for entry into the Bachelor of Engineering. Completion of UniReady will be seen by Curtin Admissions as comparable to an ATAR of 70. Whereas Engineering requires an 80.\n\nCurtin College offers a Diploma of Engineering that, upon completion, will qualify you for entry into 2nd year of the Bachelor of Engineering. This is where things get a little complicated. Technically, the Diploma is 2 years (16 units). But completion of Year 12 (without ATAR) could reduce this to 18 months (12 units), depending on your results.\n\nIf you're interested, you'd better act quickly, or delay until the next Trimester. Applications are still technically open for Trimester 1, but orientation was yesterday, and classes start on the 20th.\n\nAll of Curtin College's Diplomas are registered as Higher Education courses, rather than VET courses. Unlike VET courses, which are designed to make graduates work-ready (in theory at least), Curtin College Diplomas are principally designed to prepare students for further studies at Curtin University. One benefit of this registration categorisation, is all Curtin College Diplomas are FEE-HELP eligible. FEE-HELP being a similar government loan scheme to HECS-HELP. But the devil is in the details. So thoroughly read anything before you sign it.\n\nContext: I've worked in university and college admissions for 20+ years.",

Because they had done a drafting course they also worked part time doing that while they studied. \n\nThis was nearly 20 years ago though, but I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s still something similar.",

Apply to the college for a diploma and upon completion apply to Curtin. The Diploma was quite hard given I didnt have much experience studying prior and had to quickly adopt good habits. Just be sure of your pathway if this the route you want to take. Otherwise, if you put in the work its pretty much gauranteed you'll get into the degree.",

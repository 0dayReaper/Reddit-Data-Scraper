This is my first semester using it so i was curious about people's experience eg does someone go back and watch the footage to hear what you can hear? How harsh are they? Do they mainly only look at your screen to make sure you don't have notes up?",

This is what I was told by a UC who didn't want to use it cause it was going to cause him a lot more work.",

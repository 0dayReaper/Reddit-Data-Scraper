    "postText": "Hi, Im about to finish year 12 literally have my mock exams tomorrow and haven't studied a bit. Im lazy as hell because I hate studying but I have to because my parents want me to go university and they gave birth to me for a reason so Im thinking of getting a degree and then doing whatever job I want later after their happy.\n\nAnyways I need an ATAR of 80 for my course at Curtin University, Bachelor Computing (Software Engineering). Problem is my predicted ATAR is a 65. I got accepted for an early offer and my friends are telling me that fine as long as I meet the conditions as in pass English and get WACE the Final ATAR does not matter. My teachers are telling me to change my course preference or they aren't going to accept me and take back the early offer. So which one is true? Should I actually start studying?",

My mum literally told me I can do whatever I want just get a degree first because she wants to look good in-front of our family. Either way it\u2019s too late now I\u2019m not wasting these 2 years in ATAR and I do genuinely take interest in computers and coding it\u2019s just that school stuff I hate like psychology and English. I feel like non of this stuff is useful to me but university will actually be useful because it\u2019s the industry I want to work in.",

My dude, if you\u2019re serious about policing, volunteer in your community. Get some life experience. A job in the service in the service industry is also a great way to learn to handle conflict and genuine humility. \nLearn how to talk to people. If you can\u2019t have a straightforward conversation about your own future with your mother, you aren\u2019t mature enough to interfere in other people\u2019s lives. You said you\u2019re quite lazy, and if that\u2019s true, you aren\u2019t mature enough to be a copper. \n\nI would consider something like paramedicine or psychology. If you still want to do policing, you\u2019d have a huge advantage in the selection process, and the opportunity to take up volunteering positions with Curtin.",

When you get the offer there is an option to postpone it. Tell your parents that you have the offer there and have a year to take the university up on it, but you'd like to go and work for a while first. Earn some money, get some \"life experience\", recover from school a bit and re-adjust your attitude towards education. Then, when you've done that, you can enrol with a much better chance of success. \n\nIf you want to convince them, you should have a clear plan, and it'll be easier if it's a plan that leaves uni on the table. With this approach you have a few options: \n\n1. You get some other job, things go well, and in 12 months time you say \"I'm not going to uni\". Hopefully your parents will see you doing well and be happy enough, and if not then you should be in a financially stable enough position to move out if need be.\n2. Things don't go so well, you take the offer in 6 or 12 months before it expires. You still end up at uni, but with a little less financial stress than the average undergrad. You probably also have a little more drive, since it was preferable to whatever you've been doing for the last year.\n\nFinally, like everyone I've met in computing, I'd point out that 4 units a semester full time isn't the only enrollment option that exists. Doing the degree in 4 years with 3 units a semester is a *way better* experience for most people, giving you more time and flexibility to work, do extracurricular stuff, or just really ace units. Maybe even a 2 unit part-time arrangement is a happy compromise for you and your parents that would allow you to work some fairly significant hours (I've even seen people hold down full-time jobs with 2 units) whilst still working towards the degree.",

You seem ambivalent not knowing your future career path, this is a prime reason to study. Higher ATAR - Higher number of courses to choose from. You don't want to get an ATAR that funnels you into a degree that you might not like. The offer you got is a conditional offer, contingent on prerequisites which means if you don't get/do 'insert condition', you won't get accepted. One of my conditional offers had a minimum 80 ATAR cut-off. Don't put all your eggs in one basket (I.e early offers). Early offers don't mean shit either way, my early offers were purely backup, the offers you get after you receive your ATAR are the premium. **Bottom-line is you wanna do your best, that would include studying to boost your final ATAR.**  The ATAR is only a stepping stone and a couple weeks after getting my ATAR, couldn't care less.

There's a lot about it you might not know yet. And it's not just programming. Take your time, don't let your parents push you into anything. As people have already said, nothing wrong with going for a look around and finding what you like. Doing that you can pay your own way so you don't need to feel guilty about it. Then when you know what you like, maybe think about doing a degree. Best of luck buddy.",

You have to be interested in it. \n\nI study mechatronic engineering and comp science at Curtin at the moment, I just have my thesis left but I didn't start uni until I was 30. I was a farmer before that. You have to do a degree because you're interested in the field, don't look at money at the end or anything. The old saying \"if you love your job you never work a day in your life\" is the most important. Satisfaction in your work is the most important thing, and it's different for everyone. There is nothing wrong with trying things out for a while before you know what you want to do. That's my advice anyway buddy.",

I didnt study throughout the year, knuckled down on exams and went exceptionally well (granted I did actually understand the subjects and got lucky with exams content). Pump out \\~15 practice exams each, or in english do 4-5 practice essays using resources from your teachers and online.\n\nIf you don't score a high enough study score for subjects that are prerequisites for a Uni course youll still have to re-do them before being able to study at University.\n\nPeople always say theres other options if you cant get a high ATAR, but thats rly only to make people feel better about going poorly. If you want to do secondary study at a University of your choosing, this is essential.\n\nYouve got a couple of weeks. Work hard, work smart, and then it will be over and you can enjoy the summer.\n\nI would highly suggest taking a gap year, but dont stay home. Go work in a different state, or go overseas. Once youre independent life gets so much more interesting, and youll be able to determine whether you want to study or do something else.",

You should be able to find past exams through your curriculum (i.e. VCE website if in Vic), and other tutor companies will have some available which your teachers should provide (if not ask them to buy them through the school).\n\nIt sounds rough, but trust me, its such a small amount of your life and pays off. do at least 7 practice exams for EACH subject. Upwards of 10 per subject and youre in the real money. \n\nIts actually kind of thrilling in its own way to identify mistakes and eradicate them one by one. Dont neglect leisure during this time either, reward yourself after each practice exam with a round of a game or an episode of something. Get yourself lots of snacks and drinks to have while studying (dont worry about the kilos, youll shed em when you start working)",

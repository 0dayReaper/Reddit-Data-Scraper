However if you really want to do the other unit that requires the pre req, the course coordinator can grant a pre requisite waiver for you. You just need to fill in an application and maybe speak to the course coordinator first, because they need to sign off on it. What degree are you studying?",

Then explain that you really want to do the unit that requires the pre requisite, and ask for a pre req waiver, stating that you would take full responsibility to catch up if needed. Ive done it a couple of times in my engineering degree, where ive done a unit that requires a pre req AND the unit pre req unit itself in the same semester.",

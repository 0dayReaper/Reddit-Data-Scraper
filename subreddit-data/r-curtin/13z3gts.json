    "postText": "I've been procrastinating on Exam study, and boom here we are today. I got a comp1005 exam on Tuesday. I need help on how I can pass. (&gt;40%) I do relatively well on my other UNITS but this one has literally drained my brain cells out of me. I don't think it's difficult I think i just don't try hard enough for the unit. Any help for how I can pass or how to stay concentrated is appreciated.  \n\n\nGoodluck to everyone taking exams in the coming weeks!",

Break it down into bite sized chunks. You can study for 20 minutes right? Do that. Then take a break for 10, and do another 20.\n\nMaybe try the pomodoro study with me videos on YouTube, they help me.",

Keep going until you have completed them all. \n\nYou're basically learning a new language.\n\nIf you get stuck on a particular tutorial question, and there's no one to ask, chatgpt is fluent in most programming languages. It won't always give you the right answer, but this is a basic unit so it probably will. \n\nPro tip for any other programming units, you can go to as many of the labs as you like, if there's space.\n\nThere might only be 1 or two a week in your timetable, but I spent closer to 5 or 6 x 2 hour sessions a week, all with contact time with tutors. Use the timetable planner to find out when and where all the other labs are.\n\nDo the comp sci people still do unit refreshers? I think that's usually during study break\n\n\nAlso, you do know about the comp sci and engineering drive yeah?",

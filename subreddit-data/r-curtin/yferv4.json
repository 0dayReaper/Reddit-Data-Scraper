    "postText": "I am currently a junior in a U.S. high school with New Zealand Citizenship. I hope to apply to Curtin University, Perth next year as a domestic student with overseas qualifications and I have some questions;\n\nDoes anybody have experience in going this route that could give me some insight into the process-extra coursework to meet qualifications? \n\nFrom what I have read on the Curtin website I can meet ATAR scores with an equivalent SAT score (above 1000/1600) and GPA of 3.0/4.0. I reasonably expect to score around 1100-1200 on my final SAT and end up with \\~3.5/4.0 GPA, with a year of job experience and a couple of AP course credits;\n\nWhat do you think my chances are of being accepted? \n\nI'd like to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering, major in Mining Engineering.\n\n[https://www.curtin.edu.au/study/offering/course-ug-bachelor-of-engineering-honours--bh-engr/](https://www.curtin.edu.au/study/offering/course-ug-bachelor-of-engineering-honours--bh-engr/) \n\n[https://www.curtin.edu.au/study/applying/overseas-qualifications/](https://www.curtin.edu.au/study/applying/overseas-qualifications/)\n\nThank you",

They only care about academic results for direct entry otherwise you can do a year of a diploma which won\u2019t extend the time of your degree. Just be aware the Kalgoorlie part of the course is not cheap in terms of cost of living and accomodation.",

I accessed this particular edition 7 book yesterday made annotations wrote some notes but did  not complete my activities . \nI have logged in to the e-book Central and now it states the book is only available on request and I can only access the previous additions. I am told these editions are not acceptable for this task\nWhat is going on can anyone give me any insight to this? \nI am seriously annoyed as I find this is purposely detrimental to me starting my course I have to put a request in outside business hours and now wait for a reply.",

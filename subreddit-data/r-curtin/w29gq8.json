    "postText": "I'm only in my second unit of study with curtin and I really struggled to get my assignment done on time. I submitted it with all paragraphs complete and what I thought was a pretty good essay that was in line with the rubric (especially for a rush job). However, the word count was 1500, give or take 10% (150 words). However my assignment only reached about 1100 words. Will I fail the assessment because of this?",

            "comment": "The word count is usually a maximum not a minimum (1500+10%). Generally, the coordinator/tutor are happy if it is shorter. However, you need to check if you have properly answered everything that you were asked to do. Many people who are significantly under the word count don't answer the question(s) fully.\n\n\nYou cannot be automatically failed because you fall short of the word limit.",

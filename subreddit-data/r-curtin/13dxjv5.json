    "postText": "I\u2019m a domestic Australian student, studying my grade 12 outside Australia. So I checked out open Universities Australia for architectural sciences. They recommended me to go for the pathway approach which is take the first 5 subjects of the course I should pass them then I will be enrolled into the degree, this is because my score isn\u2019t OP or ATAR.They told me that FEE-HELP would be paying for the subjects, and I don\u2019t have to be in Australia when studying the subjects. Even though on the Australian Government, studyAssist website it mentions that I should at least study one unit of the course in Australia. Another thing is that I\u2019ve contacted  Curtin University if they have online classes for Architectural Sciences they said no ,but open universities Australia said the course is fully online.\nDoes anyone have any advices for me?",

Some beginning units will be with other unis which is why it's not directly through your uni.\n\nOnce you complete the beginning units, you then enrol into the degree itself. Often the beginning units will be science or maths that you need, depending on the pathway. \n\nAs far as studying outside Australia, some units may require in person exams, some won't.",

    "postText": "I got an offer from curtin in December for starting my course this year in February, but I haven\u2019t even gotten my CoE and have no idea what\u2019s going on with my on campus accommodation now that the borders aren\u2019t even opening up yet. \nI won\u2019t know ANYONE in curtin except for my cousin who\u2019s a distant relative and who I don\u2019t really talk to, and all these uncertainties are making me very anxious and helpless, as well as fearful for what should happen if I DO go there.\nIs there any advice I could know that would be beneficial as a first year student that hadn\u2019t started my semester yet?",

            "comment": "&gt; P's get degrees mate, do as well as you can realistically can but at the end of the day all you need is a Pass (read your unit outline to see the pass requirements for your unit).\n\n&gt; Attend as many in-person classes/lectures as possible, you learn and focus far, far better when youre engaged and present, + it looks good on your record + you get to meet people in your course.\n\n&gt; If you are struggling, falling behind, or miss an assignment date TALK TO YOUR TUTORS. Tutors WANT you to pass, they arent out to screw you over and will pretty much always help you out (especially if you have good attendance).\n\n&gt; It is OKAY to take a semester off, or do a smaller 2 or 3 unit semester. Pretty much no one (only a small minority of students) pass a course in the normal amount of time. Your mental health and not getting burnt out are critical to making it through.\n\n&gt; Read your unit outline. I cannot stress how important this is. It seems boring, but it will explain all your assessable material, how much they are worth, due dates, and what you need to submit/pass to pass the unit. \n\n&gt; For Domestic Students, you can put your SSAF (Student Services and Amenities Fee, about $150) on your HECS. Go to Oasis, then eStudent, then eCAFs and fill out the form. Easy way to save money as a broke student.\n\nA final bonus tip, Happy Hour at the Curtin Tav is 4pm-5pm, and Happy Hour at Varsity Bar in Waterford is 5pm-6pm. So a smart student would drink a handful of drinks 4-5 at the tav, take the 10 minute walk to Varsity, and drink another handful before 6 ;).\n\nHope this helps, feel free to let me know any and all other questions you have :)",

I only just picked which classes I was going to attend yesterday! Don't worry about not knowing many people at first, there are so many nice and inviting people that meeting friends will be a breeze. I'm always here to help if you need any help, I hope to see you around!",

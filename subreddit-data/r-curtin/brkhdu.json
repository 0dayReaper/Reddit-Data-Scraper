            "comment": "It's not really about budget percentages, it's about what the money is spent on; and these abstractions &amp; categories add no benefit.\n\nThink about what it would *mean* to, for example, increase student engagement from 12% to 30% (and reduce other things to make it add up). What would that allow, what would it enable, what would the reductions to other categories mean?\n\nLook at it from the other angle; what things does Guild do that is a waste of money? To phrase that differently; how could they get the most out of their money; by looking at what they *could* spend money on and what they *are* spending money on.\n\nIf you want my personal opinion, Guild is doing pretty alright. All the issues I have with Curtin can only be solved by Curtin University proper. Parking, building maintenance, confusing degree types (What the fuck is a Bachelor of Science in Science in Computing; Cybersecurity stream? How do I write that on a resume? Why isn't it a Bachelor of Computing in Cybersecurity or a Bachelor of Science in Computing; Cybersecurity minor?), poor support for people with disabilities (sucks if you're deaf and want iLecture subtitles. sucks if you're in a wheelchair and have classes in some of the older buildings without elevator access to all room), some departments seriously underfunded (computing; some lecture slides haven't been updated since I was in primary school) while others get constant upgrades (what the fuck is a social media control center?), more rooms for club events (this almost comes under Guild, but Guild can't construct buildings so it really is up to the administration).\n\nBesides all that, if you asked me right now to my face what my biggest issue with Curtin is; it'd be lecturers that don't use the microphones when delivering lectures (even after you've emailed them asking them to); so it's almost impossible to hear/understand them when reviewing the lecture recordings on iLecture. Even worse if they have a thick accent and/or a bad habit of pacing back and forth the lecture hall.",

Or more support for restaurants to expand at the same price point.\n\nThese resteraunts on campus still operate as businesses. There's no doubt they have chosen the price they have for a reason. Any more and they'd have less customers; and less and they wouldn't be making enough money from the extra customers to make it worth it.\n\nMore subsidies doesn't change the spending habits of students or that basic fact of economics. They'll just work on improving their bottom line or broadening to a wider range of products; sold at the same cut.\n\nJust look at the tax cuts presented to American businesses recently; consumer costs didn't drop one bit.\n\nFurther; that means cutting funding from activities, and funding has a problem of diminishing returns. It's likely 3% is all the businesses on campus require to operate properly. More would help them run better, but it's likely it wouldn't lead to improvement in efficiency or enjoyment for students. Meanwhile that 5% cut to activities might mean dropping the once-a-semester per club free poster printing (which a lot of small clubs rely on to build a member-base) or less funding put to the Guild website (which is the first point of contact with a lot of new students and the Guild).",

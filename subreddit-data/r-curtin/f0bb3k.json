Or even anyone else here starting uni for the first time this semester? \nWill be studying Construction Management if that\u2019s of any use! \nThanks \ud83d\ude01",

And now 2.5 years later and I know about 2 people in my entire cohort. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly lonely, sing all these tight friendship groups while you sit on the side lines, unable to get in on the action. \n\nAlso I have no idea if you education background but just be chilled, if you get overwhelmed take your crying butt down to student services. It\u2019s legitimately a good resource. X",

Curtin offered my course and was the only one in WA to do so. It sucks because everyone knew each other on the first day.",

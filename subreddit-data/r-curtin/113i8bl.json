    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019ve been looking at mechanical engineering at UWA and Curtin and was wondering what opinions people out there had regarding the quality of teaching they have experienced at either universities. Does the prestigious status of the uni heavily influence whether you will get your first job in this industry. Does either uni provide work experience and do they have good connections with the industry? \n\nAny advice or experiences to share would be appreciated.",

I went to UWA and it quickly became apparent how out of touch the coursework was with what Mech engineers in Perth were actually doing. When the majority of the work in Perth is either materials handling or piping/hvac I think I had 1 lecture on pump calcs and none on materials handling.   In truth it probably won't matter once your graduate and get real world experience. Best of luck with your decision.",

If you want to work directly for a big mining company i can confidently say that where you do your vacation work has the most impact on whether I would hire you as a graduate rather than where you went to uni.\n\nIf you wanted to get into a specific areas such as design etc then you should choose where you want to go based on the courses and resources that the uni has. \n\nWe are lucky in WA that we have great universities\u2026 so it doesn\u2019t really factor into the equation (my opinion).",

Get a job working as a junior engineer doing cad, tech writing, something. That will be your edge. As an employer I would pick up a grad with actual work place experience over a grad without it or a Kmart job. Oh and the race cars that they build at uni is cool but it's not really enough",

            "comment": "Plenty of excellent options, my personal favourites are the lunch specials up at Main Cafe (the cafeteria-style one near the temporary library). I also like to use the food vans that come around.\n\nIf you are chasing a burger and fries Angazi cafe up near the business end of campus has good wedges/fries/burger.\n\nGeorges Kebabs next to the tavern is also good for snack packs/kebabs.\n\nSome of the tavern lunch specials are good and reasonably priced ($13 for a middie of beer/cider and food) The better ones of that are the wings and the burger day. The fish and chips and schnitzel one was a bit mediocre.\n\nIf you have a car or a mate with a car, Waterford and Vic Park are close by and have a much larger range of food options. Varsity at Waterford is good for burgers and they have specials that are pretty good. Chilliz at Waterford is also good for cheap eats. Vic Park is good for lots of places, my personal shoutout goes to Lolas in vic park, their Fried Chicken and Gravy is very good. I would also recommend dragon hotpot in vic park for maybe dinner more than lunch.",

I would recommend attending all your tutorials though as they are incredibly important for learning. Lectures will be uploaded and can be rewatched so attendance isn't as important.",

However, it is likely to be because it makes you more engaged in learning and more likely to engage with your tutor and peers. Also, lecture recordings are generally intended for revision, and not a substitute for attending.",

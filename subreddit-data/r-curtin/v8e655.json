It will ask for your student ID card or some other form of accepted Id and for you to hold it up to the screen to record it in their system. It will then record your screen, your webcam and audio for the duration of the test or until you finish which ever comes first. The last time I used it (which was 2020) it wouldn't let me use an external monitor with my laptop connected to it sitting next to the monitor.\n\nFrom what I've heard from lecturers it alerts them to noises and movement and then someone just has to manually check which is why a lot of UCs don't use it cause it's a pain to check for 500 students.\n\nYou are able to go to the bathroom or get some water etc. Just speak into the camera and say what you're doing so they know. \n\nGood luck!",

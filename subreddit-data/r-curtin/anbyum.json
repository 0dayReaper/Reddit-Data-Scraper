I don't think it has an exam, it doesn't have any mathematics, and the lectures are basically just watching space documentaries for two hours at 5pm. The lecturer is a super cool dude too.\n\nIt has some written assignment but they aren't too hard, and are pretty open-ended. One asked to write on the subject of the Moon or the Earth. I wrote some stuff about building space bases on the moon and how the lower gravity would make industry and launching ships super easy. Just sci-fi futurology dribble. Got like a 90 on it.",

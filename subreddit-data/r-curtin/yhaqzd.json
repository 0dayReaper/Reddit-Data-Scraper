    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m wanting to go away overseas for two to three weeks during my first semester on April 25th. I would only be doing three units and I\u2019d be watching the recordings and doing the work. Would it be feasible or would it be hard to do?\nBasically I\u2019d just like to know how hard the first sem units are and when the due dates are. Thank you",

Sometimes it's still run in a lab so you could go but don't count on it. \n\n\nFirst-semester computing was just ISAD, the NPSC (Indigenous Science) unit has compulsory labs, but you can attend in person or online. If you're in semester 2, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) has weekly required labs and a very full-on workload though so be careful.",

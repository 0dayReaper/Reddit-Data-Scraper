Does anyone know anything about this or how students at expected to respond? Like, do they want students to complain to the University about this so the University increases the wages? I\u2019m not sure what this particular action does besides disadvantage students who are trying to be organised before Blackboard populates the unit.",

Staff aren't coming into work for a couple of days specifically in the beginning of orientation week to keep the impact on students to a minimum.\n\nThe university is pulling some crap. They circumvented the union, put up a broken ballot to staff (you could select both yes and no), and put conditions on the ballot which made a significant portion of casual staff ineligible (you needed to have worked between the 3rd-9th of Feb, and many casual teaching staff only work during semester).\n\nIf your UC is doing something in excess of the action, that sucks. With all luck you'll get it Wednesday. If you want something to hold you over then you might be able to find a previous years' outline [here](https://litec.curtin.edu.au/teaching_learning_services/unit_outline_builder/search_published_UO.cfm).",

                            "comment": "Hi Luminitha,\n\nI work as a Teaching Support Officer for Curtin, and am also a Union member. The ban on unit outlines is intended as a way to disrupt management and make things harder for them. The unit outline is not just a guide to the unit, but also forms a legal agreement with the student about what the rights and responsibilities of each party (Uni and Student) are. Without it, there is no legal agreement and therefore, an issue for management. \n\nSo, for example, a UC informs teaching support that they will not be working on their UO as part of industrial action. We then inform our Manager, as we are unable to complete this work as it is specificly Academic content. Our Manager also can't complete it for the same reason, so the issue rises higher and higher up the management chain. Disrupting the student experience is also part of it - we would very much like you to inform the Student Guild (who are in solidarity) or the Executive branch about your displeasure with this. \n\nYou may also ask why this hasnt been communicated to students, either via the Union or the Student Guild and the reality is the Executive has gone out of their way to throttle the Union by dictating who they are allowed to contact and by what methods. Many staff on my team were unaware of the full scope of information they were being asked to vote on until Union members spoke up about it, on an interpersonal level. This is because of the control of information by the Executive. They have engaged in bad faith negotiating, intimidation tactics, and what I can only describe as propoganda with their own internal messaging. They have also been holding up a new EBA agreement for literal years at this point. \n\nCurrently members are participating in a WFH initiative to empty campus of staff during O-week. There are also bans on participating in the organisation of or attendance of Curtin events. There are more industrial actions we may take as this continues. Reminder here: the Executive could put a stop to this soon by returning to the negotiating table, and negotiating an EBA which has fair pay, fair work conditions (especially for casualised staff who experience broad wage theft) and to commit to First Nations targets. That is all the Union is asking for, its not an outlandish request. \n\nYou can find more info here: [https://www.nteucurtin.info/](https://www.nteucurtin.info/) \n\nPlease share this info widely with fellow students, and let them know to direct their displeasure to the impact the Executive is having on their student experience (especially considering how much you guys pay for these units) to the Student Guild.",

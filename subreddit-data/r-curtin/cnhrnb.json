    "postText": "So after dicking around at UWA part time and trying a bunch of classes to figure out what I wanted to do I\u2019ve settled on Medical Imaging which is a bachelor offered at curtin. I\u2019m only doing 2 units this semester, the physics bridging unit and ANHB1002 which I took cause I find it interesting and mostly just to keep myself busy (I only work max 20hours a week so I can get pretty bored). However I got hit with some health issues and family stuff the beginning of this semester and think it would be best to just drop the human bio unit. My only concern is if lots of discontinued units will look bad when I apply? I\u2019ve dropped about 1 unit per semester over 2 years though none (yet) this semester (I was always part time and still figuring out what I wanted so it never bothered me to drop a class that wasn\u2019t working out) and completed 2 per semester all in STEM subjects (I finished all my chem and bio classes, dropped mostly computer science and one communicating science class).\n\nAm I just being paranoid or should I just stick out the human bio unit (it\u2019s def not a requirement for application to my bachelor of choice) to avoid another discontinued unit?",

So you come out of, for example, an Engineering degree after 5 years with the same knowledge (related to your field of study) that you used to get in 4. It's also thought that it may be just to keep you on campus longer and get a few more $ from you. The uni will argue that this is not about that at all, and it is just \"changing to suit a changing world\", or \"improving the student experience\".",

Something I've noticed is that UWA engineering graduates will choose a lot of finance/accounting units for their broadening year, and they apply for Big 4 firms. My brother works at one and he said there are quiet a few STEM grads coming through these days.",

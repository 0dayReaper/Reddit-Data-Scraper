    "postText": "I\u2019m a third year masters student completing my fieldwork before finishing mid-year. I\u2019ve been doing full time fieldwork since Feb, and have another six weeks ahead of me. \n\nFor the first two months I worked weekends to sustain myself financially. My savings still dropped due to extra fieldwork-related expenses (buying clothes for two different dress codes as I was asked not to wear Curtin uniform, and so much petrol from 3-4 daily home visits across Perth). My current placement is regional so I am no longer able to work. My only income now is Centrelink, and after rent and bills I have a grand total of $26 per week to survive on. \n\nI applied for the fieldwork bursary (via the equity scholarship program) but received an email this week to say my application was unsuccessful. I considered following up to ask why, but I know realistically they aren\u2019t going to reverse their decision. I feel so stupid now, but I was completely relying on this bursary to replenish some of the savings I\u2019m having to use up. I hadn\u2019t considered not getting it as a possibility.\n\nI am completely distraught and don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t afford to complete my fieldwork without financial support. Do I have any options?",

My guess is that things are extra extra dire this year, so it's just a lot harder to make the cut for the scholarships.",

I have received it once in the past too, and I do wonder if that combined with more applications is why I was unsuccessful this time. \n\nI know the bursary was heavily advertised in my cohort this year whereas previously it wasn\u2019t, so I can confirm just based on that alone that there would\u2019ve been more applicants than usual.",

    "postText": "I\u2019d like to do my masters in Speech Pathology and the WAM entry is 65. I\u2019m meant to graduate by the end of this year and due to a string of mental health problems and COVID disruptions, my marks are sitting just under 65. I really want to do this masters. It\u2019s been something I have felt so passionate about for so long and I don\u2019t really have a back up plan yet\u2026 can anyone help me? Does the university consider those with marks that fall slightly under the requirements? \nThanks, any and all advice welcome!!",

If you really want to do it you should try to find an academic placement, a 30 second search found [this one](https://scholarshipdb.net/jobs-in-Australia/Research-Associate-Curtin-University=AYohKlUg6RGUVQAlkGUTnw.html) which is out of date. but its in the area you are interested in and paying 80k rather than you paying for it....i'm sure if you look harder you will find something.  Theres contact info on the bottom of it too and it seems he still works there...",

I started uni later and now that I\u2019m 26 I would prefer to enter the professional world a bit sooner. I originally went to uni without a plan, not knowing what I wanted to get out of it. Once I figured it out, the masters seemed more appealing to me as it is a 2 year course. Hopefully I can continue raising my WAM and have a successful application. Thanks for the comments!",

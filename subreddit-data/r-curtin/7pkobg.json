    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI am a graduating American student with the opportunity to do research as a postgrad at Curtin this July. I was wondering if anyone might be able to provide insight into the Curtin/Perth culture- is it possible to get around without a car? How well does public transport work if one would like to get to Perth from campus? How is campus life like? etc. etc. \n\nI am unfamiliar with Curtin/Western Australian culture aside from what I've read on the Curtin site, so any information would be appreciated! If you are familiar with American culture I'd appreciate comparisons as well. Thank you SO much in advance!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m an undergrad at Curtin, originally from Indiana (I started my degree in Indiana a few years ago and am finishing it up now that I have Australian citizenship). The differences between American university studies and Australian university studies took me a while to get used to. The main thing (to me) is the difference in grading (it\u2019s not ABCDF, it\u2019s \u201ccredit,\u201d \u201cdistinction,\u201d etc., and it\u2019s harder to achieve a perfect or close to perfect score).\n\nAustralian culture isn\u2019t that different from American culture. People will tell you that Australians are more sarcastic and irreverent in their humor, but I think that just varies from person to person as with most things. Some Australians like to talk shit about Americans, especially when it comes to American politics and gun violence, Hollywood, American food or obesity. They might make fun of the words you use or how you pronounce some things. But it\u2019s generally meant to be light-hearted teasing, so its best not to take it too personally. \n\nPublic transport is amazing here compared to public transport in Indiana. If you\u2019re from NYC or Seattle, you probably won\u2019t be too impressed with TransPerth, but it\u2019s really pretty good. I don\u2019t have a car.\n\nI\u2019d suggest finding somewhere to live in Bentley, Karawara, Waterford, Victoria Park or Cannington. You can definitely find a room in a sharehouse at the price you\u2019re looking at. Curtin has some information on finding sharehouses, but you can also search Gumtree (which is like Craigslist, but has less of a reputation for being creepy). I live in a sharehouse with a few other students in their late 20s/early 30s, and it\u2019s really quite pleasant.\n\nThere\u2019s a Facebook group called \u201cAmericans living in Perth\u201d that I would suggest joining if you have questions you\u2019d like to ask other Americans, specifically. Lots of food recommendations, reminders to pay your taxes, and etc. in the group. :)",

They do give priority to international students and rural students with no family in the Perth area. It would most likely be younger people as well, in the 18-24 year old age range. You could probably find a sharehouse of younger people as well, though (I was just looking particularly for a house of people who wouldn\u2019t be loud/partiers).",

Perth isn't the most public transport friendly, but if you plan on just staying within metro areas, you can manage.\n\nCampus is pretty alive compared to a few years ago when I was studying there. They've really activated a lot of the spaces, so they have a hammock hotel and bean bags all over campus, food trucks during the week and the Student Guild run some decent events and have some active clubs depending on what you're interested in. The tav on campus is the best one out of all the other unis. They have a gimmicky autonomous driverless bus on campus you can try riding and they run craft workshops once a week in the library. There's also a bunch of different sea containers around campus that run workshops or have activities throughout the week.\n\nBe warned though, food on campus can be pretty expensive, but you can go to Waterford Plaza opposite the campus for cheaper meals. \n\n",

The food there is also pretty decent.\n\nYou'd need to house share for that price, but the area around the campus, Bentley/Vic Park/St James would be within that price range. The uni even has free campus buses that go around the surrounding suburbs every 15 minutes or so that might help save money. Vic Park has a main strip along Albany highway that has plenty of cafes/restaurants and would be convenient for grocery shopping etc.\n\nIf you need help finding housing, get in contact with the housing department at Curtin, they usually have a list of rooms available to rent in the areas around campus and can advise you on your rights as a tenant etc. \n\nSince you're only here a semester, you'll prob only have time to check out the main tourist hubs, so public transport should be fine to check out places like Fremantle or the city, there are some cool new pubs and pop up bars in the area just north of the CBD in Northbridge, that's the main \"nightlife\" area. If you plan on going to Rottnest, the ferry departs from Freo too.\n\nIf you're interested in sports, the Curtin Stadium has some pretty active sports clubs and social sports during semester.\n\nWhat are you doing your postgrad in?",

Not saying it's a bad thing, but it is much more common to share a private rental than it is to live on campus. Bentley and its surrounding suburbs (e.g. St James, Waterford, Karawara) have a reputation for being a bit sketchy, but it is also overblown a bit. I've heard good things about the \"flatmates\" app, there are facebook groups and wechat groups as well for finding sharehouses.",

St James, Bentley, Waterford, and Karawarra are all fine as long as you lock your doors and there is no better option from a convenience point of view as you can literally walk to campus from those areas. Most of the other surrounding areas are fine with less of a reputation, it largely depends on your budget for rent and your tolerance for travel. Public transport can be absolutely shocking in Perth, and I wouldn't want to rely on any route that involves making a connection (i.e. you want 1 bus direct, not 2 busses). I liked the Lynwood/Parkwood area with an e-bike, 20 minutes to Curtin, &lt;10 to Carousel (nearest major shopping centre).",

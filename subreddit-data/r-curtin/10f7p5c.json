I already reached an ATAR above 70 and met the mathematics requirement for the course I want to do.\n\nI'm wondering which optional units are the easier ones to do. If anyone has some suggestions please tell me thank you.",

I personally didn't have any issues though. I'd describe it as being straightforward, but it depends on how good you are at writing essays I guess. :)",

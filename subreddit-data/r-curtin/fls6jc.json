    "postText": "Hi all, Hana (2020 Guild President) here.\n\nYesterday we were able to negotiate a two-week extension on the census date at Curtin University (the date after which you will receive financial and academic penalty for withdrawal from units) from March 20th to April 3rd. If you're a student you'll have been sent an OCC confirming this. Our motivation was to allow all students to have a taste of what complete online study is like before signing on to an entire semester of it. So if you're currently stressin about withdrawing tonight, dw you've got a little more time.",

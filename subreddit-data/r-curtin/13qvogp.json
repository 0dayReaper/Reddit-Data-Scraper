    "postText": "First year eng student here and i am going to fail my COMP1005 unit in my first sem. Was wondering whether i should take the unit next sem and replace another unit (which would extend my full course structure by a semester), or take the 5 week summer school unit. I have heard that the summer school unit is much harder however. Any suggestions or previous experiences with a similar situation would be greatly appreciated :)",

Does INDE1001 offer a summer unit and can you do summer units even if you didn't fail the unit originally?\n\nIn answer to your question OP definitely take the summer school unit. It's shortened for starters so it's less of a time investment and think about the opportunity cost of not doing it. If you delay your course by a semester that's 6 months worth of corporate wages you'll be missing out on.",

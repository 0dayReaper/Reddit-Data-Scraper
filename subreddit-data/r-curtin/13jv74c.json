By doing this, I am hoping to raise awareness of any systemic issues at Curin or within a particular faculty to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor.  \n\n\nI'd love to hear about experiences where you feel the Unit Coordinator has rejected reasonable accommodations without reasonable justification.  \n\n\nMarissa",

    "postText": "I am an international student who has already enrolled in uni. I lodged my visa application 50 days ago. My scholarship offer will expire in another 60 days from now. And I am advised by supervisor to join on 1st of june which is about 30 days from now. Current status of my application is still 'received'. Should I start worrying? Will my scholarship offer deadline be extended upon request in case of further delay in visa processing? I am starting to hear stories of very long delays in processing. Any useful information/advices will be appreciated.",

I applied via an agent and since then ( more than 2 weeks) I have not gotten any application confirmation. I am afraid I am being shitted at here. Idk.. maybe not.\n \nWhat was your application experience? Was it paper based? Was it via a portal? Did you get a confirmation after submission?",

            "comment": "Fastest way is via the application portal- where you will get an application confirmation email and a student ID in the process.\nAgent might have lodged a paper application which can take longer. You can always call the future students team to confirm an application has been received (admissions might be behind on processing)",

My agent told me that its because of the influx of applications due to Australia opening its borders. \n\nI applied through an agent who gave me a form, which I believe she will input herself on a portal or send directly to the university's recruitment officer. So far, she told me that the uni hasn't at least made an acknowledgment receipt email. \n\nI'm also looking into the best university for me at the moment. We should connect!",

All my agent sent me was a reference number that is usually sent when lodging an enquiry. Anyone can get that reference number and that is why I am doubting. Seems like she did not use the correct procedure:(. Let me send you a PM!",

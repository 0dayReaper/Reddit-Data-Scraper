When I go to current enrollment in eStudent, the units for this semester has all disappeared and for next semester I just enrolled are shown on the page. When I go to enrol in units,  the unit I worry about failing says Planned where as all other units Iv enrolled says Enrolled,  does it mean I fail that unit?",

Once they disappear that means your grade is in the system. You then go to enrol in units and anything saying \"enrolled\" you've passed and anything saying \"planned\" you have not.",

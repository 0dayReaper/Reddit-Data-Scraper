    "postText": "Hey there guys I\u2019m just typing this, bc I\u2019m really confused and just need some advice. So I\u2019m currently studying a bachelors of biomedical sciences (1st year) and I have this gut feeling that I should switch to the proper med course. \n\nI\u2019ve looked into everything I need to do in order to do the switch and currently I do have a CWA of about 82, and i did ATAR chem, however I don\u2019t have the ATAR score for med, and I don\u2019t have a ucat score so I know I need to sit that before applying. \n\nHowever. Im also thinking that this is me trying for something that is quite impossible to achieve, without thinking of the consequences or whether I\u2019ll be able to cope with the workload especially after the killer year 12 I had. \n\nWhat do you guys think I should do or should know about this whole process. Anything helps\n\nMany thanks from a confused student.",

            "comment": "Hey there- current Curtin med student. My honest belief is that if you\u2019re considering med at all, it\u2019s worth applying. You can think about the workload and balance once you get an offer. If you don\u2019t at least try, you will always think \u201cwhat if?\u201d You aren\u2019t sacrificing your current degree by applying to med. \n\nIt is my understanding that once you begin a uni course, the ATAR doesn\u2019t matter anymore? So wouldn\u2019t they be looking at your CWA anyway? \n\nMy one question- why did you pick biomed? Are you interested in the field or did you use it as a path to med? This is super important",

I took a gap year and actually dedicated some time to prep for it and then resat it and got in. It\u2019s not the end of the world if you don\u2019t get in the first time :)",

            "comment": "I wanted to go down this pathway in 2020. I was studying health sciences at Curtin. I was working towards the grades and had my UCAT booked. They then changed the entry requirements regarding the chem classes I needed to take at Curtin. When they made the changes it was too late for me to switch chem classes as it was halfway through the semester. I had been in contact with the dean of the medical school a few times and he never mentioned the upcoming change to entry requirements. These changes then meant I was now illegible and was unable to apply. I was devastated. Just something to be aware of! I doubt they would do that again but definitely have a back up plan if this happens again or if you don\u2019t get in. Good luck, I wish you the very best!",

I some how ended up having Curtin students in my rooms now for their GP placements. \n\nWorkload will be heavy like you\u2019ve never seen before. But somehow, you\u2019ll cope. You\u2019ll build resilience and you\u2019ll do the best you can. Like the other guy said, if you don\u2019t try you\u2019ll never know. Don\u2019t spend you life thinking about the what ifs.",

Other then that your CWA seems promising and so long as your chem atar prereq still counts then you could be in luck. \n\nIn terms of is it doable at Curtin specifically? Yes I know a guy whose graduating this year at Curtin med who course switched from speech therapy using a high CWA. Your best bet would be to contact both your course coordinator and the Curtin med school dean to confirm the entry requirements and also the likelihood of being successful",

One of my courses requires 12 weeks online and 5 day block on campus. Does this mean we only have 1 week face to face meetings and the rest will be online for the whole semester? Big thanks!",

For argument sake, if you had 2 hours of laboratory classes each week for 12 weeks, you could instead do all 24 hours of laboratory classes in one week. I suggest you email the unit coordinator to ask them what it means in your case.",

    "postText": "Hey Folks, \n\nI was wondering if anyone/friends you know, has undertake the Grad dip / Masters in Environment and Climate Emergency? I recently missed out on a job promotion in a public sector department and I'm potentially seeking to re-tool/re-skill into other areas. Recently I have been examining climate policy development etc.  \n\nHas anyone completed this course? Any overall thoughts?\n\nSome of my worries about undertaking this course are employment pathways and the generalised nature of the Grad Dip potentially leading a situation where an understanding of the topics are good but are too broad for employment purposes. \n\nAny opinions are welcome :) \n\n\nhttps://handbook.curtin.edu.au/courses/course-pg-graduate-diploma-in-environment-and-climate-emergency--gd-envclmv1",

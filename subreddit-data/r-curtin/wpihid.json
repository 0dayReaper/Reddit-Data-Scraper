    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI am currently in High School and I am planning on doing a course that requires Maths Methods, yet i am doing applications. My ATAR is above the necesary requirements. What can i do to get in with my lower level of math? Is there a bridging course? Or a course that can count as Methods?\n\nThanks in advance.",

    "postText": "I just got my ATAR results, and I was 5 points off the minimum selection rank of 95 for Curtin medicine (didn't pass wace chemistry either). I've accepted an offer for Health Sciences, in the hopes that I'll be able to course switch in my 1st year. \n\nI know I'll need to have a **CWA of above 80** and a competitive UCAT score, so these are my questions:  **1.** how difficult is it to maintain an above 80 CWA in the first year? \n\n**2.** What units in health sciences are good for keeping your average up?? \n\n**3.** Do you guys think its worth it to give health sciences a shot and course switch? \n\nMy other option was that I would go to UWA and do a major I would excel in to keep my GPA above 5.5  (I was thinking history) and a couple chem/bio/phys units to prepare myself for the GAMSAT. The thought of gamsat scares me lol so im leaning more towards curtin right now. Out of the Curtin pathway or graduate med at UWA which one would yall reccommend??",

            "comment": "You need an 87 CWA at least. And a UCAT of at least 3000 if you want a chance at an interview at Curtin. These scores are achievable, but do not take my word lightly.\n\nDon't do health sciences for the sake of doing health science. Do a degree that you're interested in, which could in turn be \"easier\" because you're already drawn to the respective units to begin with. \n\nHop on to Medify, which is a practice website for the UCAT. The subscription is okay for the amount of practice questions, and explanations you get. I recommend doing 1 hour of practice daily, and at least 4 hours during the uni break in the lead up to the actual exam.\n\nJust a heads up, GAMSAT + UWA postgraduate med is a really (and I mean that as an understatement) gruelling and tedious pathway. Try to get into Curtin using the benchmark grades I've mentioned above.\n\nShoot us a message if you need.",

There is no use being scared (which I know is easier said than done). Some lessons I learnt from first year: \n\n-Group projects may bring you down -- not everyone you meet in first year wants to score a really high CWA to course switch into medicine. Compensate and prepare for potentially lower grades, though not by much, by acing your other assignments.\n\n-Study buddies (no more than a group of three) is optimal, please do your very best to focus on your studies (looking at you hormones!!). You'll be met with personal hurdles and opportunities to constantly evaluate your motivation for medicine. Scope out study buddies who want to get into medicine, at least they'll be on the same page as you regarding motivations. \n\n-Maintain your mental health\n\nBy the way, if you do not get in by the first year of your degree, you are not allowed to switch to a different degree to use the \"first-year\" of that degree in lieu of the last one you did. That is, the grades of the first year in your NEW degree will be null - won't be considered for course switching. My point is, if you want to get into Curtin Medicine, through as a course switcher, you're looking at getting it done by your very first year of your very first degree at Curtin. Otherwise, things will get even more challenging. \n\nMy DMs remain open \n\nEdit: spelling and more points",

Bit concerned because I'll have to juggle studying for the course, my ucat preperation and some casual shifts during the week to financially support myself",

In the kindest way possible, you're aiming for a similar to what you were aiming for in year 12 but now you're an adult who needs to support themselves and your studies will need to be more self motivated and organised by you. If you didn't have the drive to do it this year with the support provided by school then I'd make it easier instead of harder.",

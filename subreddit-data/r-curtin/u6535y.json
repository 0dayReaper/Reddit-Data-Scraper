Was wondering if anyone has done it before either at Curtin or elsewhere and can share their opinion on where the best place to do it is in terms of facilities, equipment, teaching etc!\n\nI am not looking for if it has high job prospects, I understand a creative degree comes with it's cons. I'm just wondering which university offers the best possible film-based degree. Thank you!",

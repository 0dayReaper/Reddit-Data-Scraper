            "comment": "I graduated from the course 6 years ago straight out of high school. to succeed in the career path you have to have the right kind of personality for it (deal well with criticism, not be the type to crack under pressure) really want it and utilise any networking opportunities presented to you. Develop your side skills in either photography or illustration as you will need one or the other for many assignments. Most of the people that did well in the course (aside from a few exceptions) were in their mid-late 20s and honestly I wish I\u2019d waited a bit instead of going into it fresh 18 as I think my ideas would\u2019ve been more mature and developed. Of course everyone is different though!  But for me it really sucked the joy out of my love for advertising and copywriting.",

I studied graphic design and advertising at Curtin (graduated in 2000) and I\u2019m now the Creative Director at one of Perth\u2019s top agencies. The uni course was good, but AWARD School is the course to do if you want to fast track into a creative role. It\u2019s run by the Advertising Council of Australia. Night school - 1 lecture night, one tutorial night a week for 12 weeks. It\u2019s run by volunteers from the industry (I was very involved over the last 3 years) and it\u2019s a great way to get a taste of agency life and get your foot in the door. It\u2019s fairly pricey though (I guess not so much compared to a uni degree!) and competitive to get into - there are around 10 or so students selected each year. But if you show promise, you\u2019re likely to get a spot. As others have said above - a little bit of life experience behind you goes a long way in this industry. As does spending some time developing your crafting skills in either art direction or writing. But there\u2019s no age requirement for the course. And it would be rare for a top tier agency to hire a junior who hasn\u2019t graduated from AWARD School. I\u2019d be happy to chat further about your aspirations if you like. It really can be the best job in the world.",

Please help, thanks!\n\nNote that, this is not referring to the passing grade C(50-59) which is 2.33",

            "comment": "I think you are confused. You will be awarded your bachelor's degree (graduate) if you complete all the required coursework. E.g. you could average less than 2.33 if you only pass with C's and fail multiple units. Masters courses will often have a minimum CGPA for admission, but that is a different question.",

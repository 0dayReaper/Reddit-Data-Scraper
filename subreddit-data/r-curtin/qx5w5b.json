            "comment": "The unit is pretty tough,\n\nEven if you're not a huge fan of the practical component, going to the labs is really important. The teachers of the unit put in a lot of effort to visually show you how everything works, and (if it's still the same as when I did it) the lab sheets they give you to fill out are a great way to guide your study for the unit.\n\nChances are you won't finish everything in the lab sheets every week, but if you can get home and fill out the rest with correct answers on the day that you went to the lab, it will get you far.\n\nIt really comes down to not letting it build up into too much of a issue later down the line. Try to stay on top of it is the best advice I can otherwise give you.",

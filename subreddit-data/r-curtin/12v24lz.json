    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm interested in completing this degree but fully online. I'm married and also a father, so I don't really have time to go to Uni. I have a lot of time during the day to study and multitask a couple of activities simultaneously every day. For those currently completing Computer Science, are all units, seminars, and labs available online? I completed a diploma in the UWA and all units were online back in 2020. Thank you very much for your help and time!",

I\u2019m enrolled for full time, on campus, but most units have recordings for all lectures and online options for tutorials that you could probably get away with not turning up on campus anyway. However, in the last year with ChatGPT, I\u2019ve noticed a few assessments that were originally online now moved to in person to avoid plagiarism.",

And even so, outlines have been subject to change as some of my previous units were done during Covid, they\u2019ve probably changed requirements since. To get the most up to date info, my best advice would be to email Curtin and ask about an online option.",

That info is usually in the course handbook which is on the web for everyone. The website is terrible though so it's still probably quicker and more accurate to email the Uni :)",

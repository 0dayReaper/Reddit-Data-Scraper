Everything is relatively new to me because in my home country, orientation is exclusive to undergraduate students. Any idea where I can find more information on the orientation? The offer letter only specified the date but not time and venue. Anything I need to prepare? General advice. Thanks in advance.",

I\u2019ve completed my undergraduate studies so I understand but a new uni in a completely different country make me feel like I am starting all over again. I will try to contact them but since I haven\u2019t arrived in WA, the only option would be through emails and online inquiries which take time.",

I would recommend heading to Curtin Connect in Building 102 during your orientation week just so you can familiarise yourself with OASIS, Blackboard, Applying your student concession to your bus/train card, getting your Student 2023 sticker which gives u access to Guild which is another sticker for discounts on coffee, books, etc. Sorry for the overload \ud83d\ude02",

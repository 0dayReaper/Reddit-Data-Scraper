    "postText": "Hey, just completed my diploma of commerce from Curtin College which is a pathway to Curtin University and straight into second year. But I tried doing the credit transfer to UWA and only got 2 units taken off (22 units in total to go).\n\nShould I stay at Curtin with 2 more years to go or Go to UWA which will take 3 years, meaning my diploma was kinda pointless.\n\nIs there any advantage to going to UWA vs Curtin?",

An extra year of study means nothing in the long run.\n\nIgnore advise about building relationships with professors. They are in the academic world and rarely cross paths with investment bankers, especially in Perth. \n\nYour best bet into get as many internships in corproate finance as you can (big 4) and use that to apply to ibs during internships / grad programmes. Thats what I did. Best of luck",

Seek out outside connections and always be on the lookout for internships and make your resume real nice so you are competitive. I think that will serve you better rather than a year spent at UWA for the same outcome really..",

Always can ask them outright if they're willing to mentor once they know you decently (or even somewhat)\n\nExpect most of your efforts to be futile but there's bound to be some returns - say if you reach out to 100 ppl/companies and only 5 get back to you...",

Do you know anyone in the industry already? \n\nThose questions are likely more important than just what uni you went to.",

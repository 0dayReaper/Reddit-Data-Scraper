    "postText": "I'm applying for internships and I'm unsure if I'm considered a first or second year student. I started an actuarial science degree at Curtin at the start of 2022, but then swapped into computer science in the second semester. 2 of the units from my first semester are also in computer science so I didn't have to re-take them. Does this mean I'm able to say that I'm a second year student?",

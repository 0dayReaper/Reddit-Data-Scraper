    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am in my final year of a degree in Health and Safety. I have 4 units\n1. OCHS3002 Health and Safety professional practice\n2. ENHL3000 Environmental Systems Management\n3. OCHS2000 Occupational Hygiene\n4. OCHS3004 Emergency Management and Incident Investigation\n\nMy question is with 1 &amp; 4. I have been a health and safety professional for over 10 years with Chief Warden training and ICAM training. Part of number 1 is 150 hours of field work in what I assume is working as a health and safety officer in a job placement.\n\nAnyone got any tips for submitting CRL for these 2 units?",

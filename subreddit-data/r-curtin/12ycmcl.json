Nothing to recruit me, just surveys. Honestly had nothing much to do and wanted to kill time, so I went along with it. And funnily enough, they are one of my friends now. We basically just bonded over because we were from the same Uni. \n\nAlthough I am raised religious myself, I made it clear to set some boundaries. A few meetups after, They suggested events for me to go to. I said no thanks.  I\u2019m just figuring out my own life, and I don\u2019t have time for that. They are chill about it, thankfully. And are happy to just meet up in more casual spaces. \n\nAlthough the second time this happened to me personally, was with a different person in a different Uni. I wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Told them I was in a rush and went off my way. \n\nSo coming from a religious person. If someone is making you feel uncomfortable in public space, you don\u2019t owe them time your time. Stay safe out there guys!",

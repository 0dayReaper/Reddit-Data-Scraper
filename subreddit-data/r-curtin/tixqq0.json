    "postText": "Hi\n\nIm going to be moving from NZ to Perth after I finish year 13 this year. I currently know no one in Perth, and am planning to be going straight into uni (for game design and animation if curious).   \nCurtin has been on my radar for a while but from what I can tell there is no dormitory accomodation. I was just wondering how I would be able to make new friends with similar interests if not dorming?   \nAlso how do the apartments work, do I get paired with random students?",

            "comment": "Unfortunately I can't provide any info on the living arrangements. But regarding the rest, I think there are a few clubs that might relate to your major/interests. Also a general recommendation for anyone I think, is the easiest way to make friends is to participate in activities you enjoy doing. There are quite a few sports facilities and groups on campus, and many listed on [meetup.com](https://meetup.com)  \n\n\nOverall, if your wondering whether coming to Curtin will deliver friendship opportunites to your door, unfortunately the answer is no. Being proactive either in class or elsewhere to make connections is necessary for everyone I think.",

Maybe join their discord and ask about how life on campus works.",

Some include meals or other services and others dont.\n\n[https://study.curtin.edu.au/curtin-life/campus-experience/accommodation/perth-on-campus/](https://study.curtin.edu.au/curtin-life/campus-experience/accommodation/perth-on-campus/)\n\nMany students also try look for nearby shared housing options. For those, you will need to search on your own",

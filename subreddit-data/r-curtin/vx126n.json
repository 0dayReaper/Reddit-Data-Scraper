    "postText": "I am an international student and will be studying in the Bentley campus this July. I was wondering does anyone have any experience staying in the campus accommodations especially Kurrajong Village? I saw a lot of bad reviews about UniLodge but nothing on Kurrajong Village. \n\nAny recommendations on campus accommodations or any in that matter is greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "Yes I lived in Kurrajong village George James as they privatised and became unilodge.\nFirst off. It is more expensive than normal housing or house sharing. You don't get air-conditioning so the summer is unbearable. You pay to wash your clothes ($4 wash, $4 dry).\ngroceries just across the road. Bus station not far. All the money your paying is for the location and the events they run. The local staff are pretty nice. They also didn't have their own internet when I was there.\nIt can be a great experience for some but not for me. So keep in mind I am biased in multiple ways.\n\nBias:\n&gt;I was antisocial so I didn't do events\n&gt; I had issues with them when I tried leaving during the start of the covid pandemic.\n&gt; I was there when washing was free\n&gt; It's been about 2 years since I lived there.",

It may help to find friends you can live with or perhaps try a site like flatmates. \n\nPlease be careful to make sure you know your rights here. I've heard of international students being scammed so watch out.\n\nIf you ever need help in Perth don't forget Curtin has services for international students.\nIf you ever have more questions feel free to DM me or reply.",

            "comment": "I've been living in Kurrajong Village for the past few weeks in a studio. So far, I have had zero negative experiences with the place. The people I've met living there were very polite and at the very least not rude at all. The staff is extremely welcoming and they were very helpful when I was settling in. \n\nLike the other comment said, there's a whole plaza called Waterford plaza across the road and you can find Coles and IGA there for your grocery needs. There are a ton of restaurants as well especially Asian cuisine (south east Asian, Japanese, etc) . \n\nIt's approx a 10-15 mins walk to get to campus depending on where your classes are. \n\nThere's no AC but you do get a desk fan (better than nothing) and my room has a heater unit. IMO, the rents not bad and I think the 50% off rent reduction for a year curtin student bonus is still ongoing but you'd have to check that yourself.\n\nEDIT : For WiFi you get to pick between using Eduroam (provided by the Uni and free) or paying with a wifi service called Superloop. I've had mostly not bad experiences with either but eduroam is a bit iffy at times.",

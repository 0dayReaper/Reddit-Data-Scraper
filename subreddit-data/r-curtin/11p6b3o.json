Upon submissions of my documents, according to them everything else is fine and I just need to change the university name in my sanction letter.\n\nAfter I do the things mentioned and submit the remaining documents, [ I am from Nepal ]. How many days would it take for the GTE response either Yes or No... According to an agent in India, also who is directly in link with the University says it may take up to 10 days...I don't know if I should believe him or not..??",

Hence you receiving an offer within a day.\n\nBut the GTE assessment process is more subjective. And often requires validating information at source (e.g. verifying bank statements, etc).\n\nIf it's been less than a couple of weeks, I wouldn't worry. After that, send them a friendly follow-up.\n\nJust curious why you didn't apply via an agent. The great majority of applicants from Nepal apply via an agent, often Global Reach, IDP, or VIEC.",

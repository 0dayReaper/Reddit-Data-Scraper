I\u2019ve heard that trend has been reflected across pretty much all other fields at Curtin, sounds like it\u2019s largely due stingy budget allocation focusing more on profits and the campus over teaching staff and resources. \n\nI\u2019ve also heard the same thing is happening at UWA, but ECU has been pretty good and seems to have the most care put into the actual teaching side of things.",

I assume this would be the same for the Perth City law campus then sadly. \n\nThanks so much for your reply by the way, very helpful",

Of course, given the current situation with covid, you miss out on a lot of the social aspects of university life, but the online materials in my experience are of a great standard. Prior to this degree, I studied primary education for a little bit and a few history subjects with Macquarie university. I must say that Curtin has done a much better job than Macquarie in terms of teaching quality - who themselves are quite respected which I guess says something about Curtin's standard. Hope this helps!",

I think you will find that at any uni. \n\nA subject matter expert does not make someone a good educator. The uni wants high ranking people from industry the students need people who can teach. Its every uni. \n\nMy Econ 101 teacher was an incredible economist and teacher but she was an exception.",

Some lecturers were great, particularly in 1st/2nd year. Most tutes are recorded or conducted online using the blackboard software.\n* Reputation is pretty good I guess, I haven't found it difficult to find jobs/internships, though I've only been at Curtin so can't really compare. I'd say UWA is generally regarded as a more reputable due to it being a part of the Go8, though from my experience most people say engineering is better at Curtin.\n* Generally I'd say your experience at uni will be what you make it, most of the time you will have to put the effort in to learn things yourself and even more so when the lecturers are trash so make sure you're doing something you enjoy.",

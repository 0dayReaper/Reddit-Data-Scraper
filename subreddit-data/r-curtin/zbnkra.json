    "postText": "Hey, I\u2019m a current year 12 student from VIC, i\u2019ve applied for bachelor of engineering majoring in mining at curtin, but i\u2019m not 100% sure if i\u2019ll be able to get the entry ATAR requirement, if i were to get a lower ATAR and/or not get one of the prerequisites.\n\nwhat are some pathways through which i can still get into Engineering?",

            "comment": "2nd year Mechatronics (hon) major here. As other posters have pointed out, Curtin Connect (student services) is your most valuable resource here - they will be able to point you in the direction of the specifics for your entry needs, they will recommend units, etc. Definitely try and have at least a phone meeting with them and explain your situation.\n\nAs for alternate pathways - when I graduated I had an ATAR of 73 - not enough for Curtin Engineeering.\nInstead, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science (Multidisciplinary Science) and selected relevant units from Eng. First year (Curtin Connect helped me to select these).\nI completed a pre-calculus and pre-physics unit, as well as Fundamentals of Programming (an Eng. FY unit)\n\nTo course-switch from Multidisc. Science to first year engineering, you must:\nachieve a weighted average &gt;70% if you're taking 3 units \nOR achieve a weighted average &gt;65% if you're taking 4.\n\nAgain this is info is correct for 2020 - it's worth calling Curtin Connect to explain your situation and ask for clarification",

Im pretty sure you could do say a 1 year of a Bachelor of Science and then transfer over provided your grades were reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurtin from memory also offers the Bachelor of Science in Mining (3 years) as well as the Bachelor of Engineering in Mining (4 years)",

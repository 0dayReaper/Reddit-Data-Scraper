But of info about myself and Curtins civil course.\n\nI'm a current nearly final year undergraduate civil engineering student and in my experience the course is pretty good.\n\nThe first year is generic across all engineering disciplines so you'll probably only have one or two units relevant to civil.\n\nSecond year you'll do quite a few units that are theory based that will underpin and prepare you for the rest of the degree.\n\nThird year is where they start teaching you engineering design and higher level topics. This is the point where you'll likely start to branch off into one of the 3(arguably 4) fields of civil engineering.\n\nFinal year you do your thesis and some integrated structural design that act as a culmination of the degree.\n\nOnce again I think it's a good course and like with all universities, you'll have your fair share of amazing and mediocre and just outright bad lecturers. But overall I would definitely recommend it.\n\nEspecially for Civil engineering Curtin is somewhat up there, and industry does generally look favorably on Curtin graduates.\n\nLastly the campus culture is pretty good too.",

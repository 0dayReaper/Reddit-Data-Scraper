    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nIt says in the description for the Curtin Excellence Scholarship that \u201cstudents who receive the StepUp bonus and therefore the required ATAR will be eligible for the scholarship.\u201d Since the StepUp bonus is 5 ATAR points, does this mean that if I got an ATAR of 92 and that got scaled up to 97 via the StepUp bonus that I would get the $15000 scholarship? If so that\u2019s pretty awesome. I\u2019m getting excited at the prospect of that but I thought I\u2019d just check with you guys here to make sure I\u2019m right.\n\nThanks.",

    "postText": "Has anyone done applied genetics and could give me some info on what it's like? \n\nI am not super keen on molecular biology and left most of the cell \"stuff\" in highschool and haven't looked at it in any of the other units I've done (2years into a double degree)... Am I totally screwed? should I dig up highschool notes and start revising cell devision a month in advance? or should I drop out all together because this is a core unit I have to do!\n\nI prefer to look at animals from a distance so this is not my idea of fun \ud83e\udd23",

The term metabarcoding definitely freaks me out but at least it seems interesting \ud83d\ude0a thanks again for helping put my mind at ease!",

Did you seriously expect all of uni to be fun or interesting?\n\nOther than that, I\u2019d say YouTube is probably a better option than high school notes to get up to date, plenty of incredibly knowledgeable content creators who are able to communicate concepts quicker and easier than most high school teachers ever can.",

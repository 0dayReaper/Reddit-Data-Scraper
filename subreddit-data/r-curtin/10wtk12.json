    "postText": "Hi, I will be joining the university for the February intake. I would like to know whether there is a limit for the number of units one can enrol in a semester. I have currently enrolled in 4 units each for semester 1 and 2. I already completed the fee payment towards the 1st semester however I am currently getting an alert regarding an outstanding fee for enrolling in a unit for semester 1. Can anyone give me clarification regarding this.",

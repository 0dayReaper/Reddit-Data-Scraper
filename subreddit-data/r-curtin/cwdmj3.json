    "postText": "Would anyone on here be interested in working for a new media outlet here in Perth. Whether you'd like to conduct your coverage in written or video format is up to you. The stories would focus on local to global issues in whatever frame you see fit. \nWhen it comes to payment, I would be prepared to pay $10/ article and $50/ video. If the platform grows I will obviously be able to pay more.\nI need passionate people who are engaged with current affairs and are interested in attaining work experience in this field. The platform is relatively small \u2013 but is growing. The goal is to merge new media with news, hopefully stimulating our generations appetite for REAL news.\n\nHere is the platform: https://www.facebook.com/TheQPerth/\n\nComment below to show interest and I'll message you!",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a recently recently graduated year 12 student and was wondering what bridging course I would need to apply for to bridge into a bachelor of engineering. I have completed English competency as well as preferred chemistry and physics courses but I have not achieved the prerequisite of a Maths Methods course (as I completed only Maths Applications ATAR this year).",

                    "comment": "Yeah, this is correct. op just needs to enrol in a bachelor of science, and take the foundation of calculus subject. Also, speak to Cesar, the course coordinator for Eng Foundation year, he will tell you what other subjects you can take during the bachelor of science that will be credited towards the engineering degree. This is the route i took... (Also might need to take \"introduction to math\"...)",

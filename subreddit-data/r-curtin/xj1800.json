    "postText": "I am 17 years post-undergrad degree, had a 16-year career in the field related to my undergrad degree (health sciences based) that was successful, including working in senior roles during part of that career.\n\nI applied for the Master in Occupational Therapy almost two weeks ago. I meet the requirement of having a health sciences undergrad; however, I don't meet the 65% CWA. My ADHD was not recognised or diagnosed until well after completing my undergrad.\n\nI've emailed and met with the course coordinator who was encouraging, harassed admissions when they rejected my application without even looking at it based on my grades, and chased them both up late last week to see where my application was at.\n\nThey're obviously considering it carefully, but did anyone else have any experience with how long the process was when they didn't meet the requirements?",

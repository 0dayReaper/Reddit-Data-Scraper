    "postText": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI'm currently in the process of applying to study Civil Engineering and contemplating switching from RMIT to Curtin University, both of which are under the Australian Technology Network of Universities (ATN), after completing a semester or two. However, I have some concerns regarding my accreditation as an international student.\n\nSince the first year typically covers fundamental courses, I wonder if transferring my credits between these ATN universities would be straightforward. It's worth noting that I am unable to gain immediate admission to Curtin.\n\nIf any of you have experience with changing universities within the ATN or have insights into the accreditation process, I would greatly appreciate your advice and thoughts.\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Firstly ATN is meaningless and has no actual impact on admissions and course transfers. However the good news is that yes you will almost certainly get advance standing for the units you have already done assuming that they cover the same foundation content that Curtin has. If you contact future students team at Curtin they will do it all for you.",

    "postText": "Hey people of curtin. i want to ask how does your smartrider card looks. if i elaborate is it printed on the backside on your id or they are both separate.\ni have seen other universities card having the smart rider and id together but the other day i went to curtin and their systems haven\u2019t been updated so wasn\u2019t able to get the id but got the smart rider(of course without concession) and they told me i could later update to concession when i get my id but been reading a lot of problems regarding both being separate. So what do you guys got to say about this?",

The little machines they check with can see it on the screen, and they will ask as necessary. \n\nForms to switch your ordinary smartrider to a concession smartrider are available at every Transperth info centre, and even some train/bus stations. If you are unsure of the process, talk to someone at the info centre and they will go through it with you. \n\nBut just for clarification, you need to keep both your Student ID and smartrider to get concession tickets. Curtin is one of the last universities to NOT combine them into one card, unfortunately.\n\nedit: Just saw your other comment. If you cannot provide proof of concession on the spot, yes you may get fined, but if you are able to show it at a later date, it will be reversed, and that information will be on the ticket if you unfortunately get one.",

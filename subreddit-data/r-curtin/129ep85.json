            "comment": "I did professional writing and publishing, did a creative non fiction unit. I don't (and never did) work in a related role. And unless you dont mind the debt and are doing it purely out of interest, i would advise against doing a degree that's writing related given that it will be one of the first areas to be overtaken by AI. Just my opinion.\n\nEdit to add: IMHO arts degrees in general can kind of be a waste of money/not worth it, I didn't see a lot of practical benefits from my degree in terms of publishing/editing. I kind of regret it - i mean it looks good on paper but my workplace is full of people who have not one speck of post-high school education.",

I loved it, but in hindsight, I should have done a double major with the professional writing degree, just to hedge my bets job wise. The first year is very generalised, and you get into more specific writing modes in your second and third years (experimental writing, poetry, long and short fiction, screen writing, writing for children and genre fiction). In your final semester, you do a supervised project that can be essentially anything you want, but your experience won\u2019t be any more specific than that (unless you go on to do honours). If you love writing, then yes, I\u2019d recommend it. You get to learn from some insanely accomplished writers, but what you get out of it is very subjective depending on your aims. Please DM me if you want to know anything else!",

            "comment": "Doing final two units of Master of Arts (Creative Writing). Definitely doing it for interest, to learn how to write a novel, rather than as a career move. \n\nLearnt about different genres of writing (long and short fiction, poetry, travel writing, writing for children, etc.); how to understand texts (formal elements, structure, context); how to write; great feedback from tutors; and also there\u2019s a strong research component (how to do research and contribute original scholarship).\n\nIt has given me time to learn how to write, lots of feedback on my writing, research skills and a broad introduction to all the different forms of writing and how to think about writing critically.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering undergrad, I would suggest doing a double major/degree, so you can learn creative writing skills, but also round you out a bit with a different discipline (whatever it is \u2014 science, law, engineering, psychology, sociology, etc.). Did my undergrad in Cultural Studies, and Anthropology and Sociology, and have also studied a few law units at Notre Dame. Can\u2019t speak highly enough of diversifying your skillset, not just relying on one thing, especially if arts related.",

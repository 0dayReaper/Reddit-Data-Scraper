I highly recommend taking human rights units \u2014 they compliment IR really well, and they\u2019re very interesting. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the UN that I didn\u2019t learn in undergrad (that I think would\u2019ve been really helpful for undergrad).\n\nThere are also only a couple of mandatory history units for IR majors, but I think taking more history units as electives would be really helpful.\n\nAsian studies units are also a common pairing with IR units.",

            "comment": "Hey, I just finished a Double Degree at Curtin with IR as one of my majors. Depends what you're interested in but I can't go past recommending *Digital Culture and Everyday Life* (NETS1000).  It's a unit where you will consider the way that digital technologies fit into different areas of life such as work, politics and activism, love, education, etc. Considering the increasing prevalence of \"information warfare\", and the fact that having an awareness of technological and economic trends is useful no matter what career you end up having, I think this would be great for you. The assessments in Sem 2 2019 were very simple:\n\n1. Essay plan,\n2. Annotated Bibliography,\n3. Final essay.You get a lot of freedom in what you write about in your essay, so you will be able to research a topic that interests you and may be related to IR. In my case, I wrote about cybernationalists in Japan and learned a lot about online nationalist political movements in Asia.\n\nOther recommendations include:  \n*Chinese Society and Culture*  \n*Social Impact of Economic Change in China and Japan*  \n*Politics of the Modern Middle East* (really unique course with one of the best teachers at Curtin)  \n*Consumer Behaviour* (great for learning a bit of psychology and business stuff)\n\nGood luck!",

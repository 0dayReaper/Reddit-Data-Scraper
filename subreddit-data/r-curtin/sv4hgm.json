I have tried different degrees, and am proof that folks rarely finish their degrees in exactly the amount of time expected.\n\nI know ALOT about the campus, including such fun facts as the best/coldest drink fountains, the quietest/busiest times, and where all the best toilets are. I can also help with general advice for new students, such as how to defer your Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAFs), how to print from any campus printer, and explanations of general course structure, what a tutorial is, etc. etc.",

It also does seem to slow considerably on busy uni days, I used it when living on-campus and on days where campus is busy you can clearly tell. If you have lots of problems you can check with Curtin ICT Services at an Abacus Lab and they might be able to help. :)",

I've heard they are divided into small areas across campus, some for study, another with the popular Short Term Textbooks, and some computer spaces. I'm gonna personally assume that no, they aren't going to be as good. The library is normally 24/7 in semester hours, heaps of space and textbooks over 3 or 4 studying floors including group study rooms, and even had a microwave, hot water, and vending machines if you wanna throw together some sort of food.\n\nGeorge's Kebabs are pretty good haha, they are maybe $10-15 depending on what you get? For food, you can do pretty well for yourself by eating at any of the venues run by the student Guild, they generally have things like sushi, sandwiches etc which aren't fancy but are cost effective (you also get very cheap coffee if you show your Guild Sticker on your student ID). If you want something nicer, Aroma Cafe and Common Ground are privately run and have a much larger variety of food. There are also food trucks around the central part of campus, these disappeared in COVID but I have heard a rumour they are coming back.\n\nHope that helps!",

Otherwise, as long as you meet all the pre-requisites (and you can maybe even negotiate some if need be) Curtin seems fairly easy to be accepted to. Many degrees are not at capacity right now due to WA's hard border keeping interstate and international students out so should be good there.\n\nAdmissions close at different times depending on the degree, year of study, and method of entry. The best way to check would be to call Curtin Connect (the student services office) on 1300 222 888. :)",

Tutors WANT you to pass, they arent out to screw you over and will pretty much always help you out (especially if you have good attendance).\r  \n\r  \n\\&gt; It is OKAY to take a semester off, or do a smaller 2 or 3 unit semester. Pretty much no one (only a small minority of students) pass a course in the normal amount of time. Your mental health and not getting burnt out are critical to making it through.\r  \n\r  \n\\&gt; Read your unit outline. I cannot stress how important this is. It seems boring, but it will explain all your assessable material, how much they are worth, due dates, and what you need to submit/pass to pass the unit.\r  \n\r  \n\\&gt; For Domestic Students, you can put your SSAF (Student Services and Amenities Fee, about $150) on your HECS. Go to Oasis, then eStudent, then eCAFs and fill out the form. Easy way to save money as a broke student.\r  \n\r  \nA final bonus tip, Happy Hour at the Curtin Tav is 4pm-5pm, and Happy Hour at Varsity Bar in Waterford is 5pm-6pm. So a smart student would drink a handful of drinks 4-5 at the tav, take the 10 minute walk to Varsity, and drink another handful before 6 ;).",

You can be included on the Vice Chancellors Honour List if you maintain a very high course average but this is more bragging rights/CV building than anything else. \n\nThe second question is definitely the case, most post-grads are already gated with needing high-ish CWAs (normally 80%+ over your undergrad). The selectors of PHD enrolment will be normally be your tutors and course instructors from your undergrad (if they are related degrees), so if you perform exceptionally and let them know you have interest in post-grad they will likely consider you. :)",

Unilodge (a private company) now owns all the on-campus accomadtion, with the exception of St Catherines (which is owned by another company). All the accommodation is more expensive than it should be. \n\nErica Underwood House, George James House, Don Watts House, and Rotary House are all very close to a medium size shopping centre (less than 5 min walk) which is extremely convenient. All the accomodations are close to uni, generally 5 min. \n\nTwin Dolphin Hall and St Catherines were only finished building this year  and are very flash and fancy at maybe 10 and 6 stories respectively. Twin Dolphin and St Cats have self contained appartments with toilets, showers, and kitchenettes. St Catherines has a mess hall where you pay for 3 meals a day in your rent. All the other accomodation has between 6 and 10 people appartments with common areas such as bathrooms and kitchens, and if early enough you can request to be with friends or specific apartments.\n\nI always found the 6 person appartment at either Erica or George James the best bang for your buck. You get to meet new people, it is faorly quiet, and lots of spacs. If you have any more specific questions let me know.",

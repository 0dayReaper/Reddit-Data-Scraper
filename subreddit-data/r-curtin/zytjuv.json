    "postText": "Have been told by both Curtin and ECU I would not get accepted with my work and life experience . I am a community support worker. \n\nI feel disheartened and disappointed that both universities told me I have no chance of getting accepted. I have only now realised what I want to do for a career. That is to become an OT. \n\nWhat can I do to boost my chances of getting into the OT degree?\n\nI am aware it is a highly competitive course. \n\nI did and got accepted into exercise and sport science and my thought is: complete 1 semester of that then transfer into OT. I asked both universities if that would boost my chances of getting into OT. Both said no :(",

I enrolled in uniready that enabled acceptance into health sciences where I did first year OT units and achieved CWA of &gt;80 and then course switched into OT for second semester. \nDon't be disheartened, if OT is your passion, keep going! But as others recommended , I would apply for health sciences and do the OT units. You have the option to course switch either semester in first year. Good luck.",

    "postText": "Thinking of Dropping out of Engineering for ComSci OR Programming. Any thoughts or opinions about this? My grades have been dropping since there are tons of issues going on at home; and I do feel like I am being forced into this course by my Dad so I am not really sure.\n\nIt's my first year. Failed three units last sem, re-did them the second this sem this year; I don't think I'm going to make it.\n\nOpinions?",

            "comment": "I graduated from W.A.I.T. (Curtin) engineering 34 years ago. The policy then was to fail 40% of the students in the first year and 10% in the remaining 3 years. The idea was to allow everyone a chance and not to rely too heavily on the TAE (TEE) results. That certainly worked.\n\nEngineering is a difficult course. It is very eclectic. You have to be multi skilled and have to approach it from many different angles. Failing units is not the end of the world - you can repeat. They want you to be pushing yourself strongly - that's very important. You need to be able to problem solve on your own - that's a critical part of engineering.\n\nProblems at home certainly don't help. One suggestion is to take a year off, get your head together, mature a little, then come back. \n\nEngineering is well worth doing and I would certainly recommend it over CompSci \\ Programming. I qualified in Communications Engineering then went into Embedded Software Engineering. I learnt on the job. My engineering training was good for my embedded work. Embedded work is interesting and challenging. It is largely C &amp; C++ on microcontrollers, and these days a good amount of Linux work is also done. It needs a good understanding of the hardware. And you can expand into all sorts of areas the CompSci guys can't such as physics, chemistry and industrial related areas.",

Part way through, he decided to switch to commerce (dropped engineering), because his scores in accounting were higher (he was on a credit 60's in engineering, while in accounting he was getting 70's and over). It really depends on how well your doing and whether you beleive you can push yourself harder in the course. My friend did computer science major a few years back and has landed himself a job right after uni. A few of my friends also failed some of their first year units, but they completed their degrees anyway. If you can't push yourself harder in engineering then you should definitely consider changing.

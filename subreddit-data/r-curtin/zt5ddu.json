            "comment": "I got into Oral Health Therapy at Curtin with an ATAR similar to yours (approx 89.9) a few years ago on second round offers but ended up changing course. If my memory is correct, I got the offer at the end of the first week of Jan. I do know that the cohort size have been changing (getting larger and then smaller again due to various factors) and this can impact the lowest ATAR scores accepted. So just relax and enjoy Christmas/ new years.\n\nAlso if the worse comes to be and you don't receive an offer and REALLY want to get into Oral Health Therapy, I'd get into the general health science course, complete 1 year (do your best, better marks make your application looks better) and then apply to transfer to Oral Health Therapy. I know they look favourably to those that have good scores in uni and want to transfer due to them seeing that you can handle uni well and thus, do well in their course. Goodluck and don't lose hope!\n\nEdit: This was my experience, since this was a couple years ago, the second round offers release date may have changed but I personally don't think so.",

I know I did nothing and waited for the second round of offers and I got lucky. I believe I took the last spot for my year when I did Oral Health Therapy. Good luck again!",

If you end up having to do health science for a year to transfer, I recommend going to open day next year. There will be a Oral Health Therapy booth and they can give you more info or tips/advice on how to improve your chances of getting in via that pathway.",

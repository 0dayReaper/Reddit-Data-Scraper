Check the most recent unit outline and see if the unit has exams + the class schedule and what the lecture topics are to see if you like it",

If you're wanting to do a business/commerce related elective:\n\n- Consumer Behavior (no exam)\n\n- International Marketing (online lectures + a take-home exam)\n\n- Introduction to Planning (1.5hr exam but the unit is incredibly easy. Free marks)",

            "comment": "Curtin is located in Bentley, some nearby suburbs are Victoria Park, East Vic Park, Saint James, Kensington, Karawara and Waterford. There's also South Perth, Como, Manning and Salter Point, however those areas, particularly SP and Como, are very affluent and pricey.\n\nEDIT: realestate and domain are good websites for looking up rentals in Aus. I'd link them, but it seems to be screwing up my comment. Hope this helps!",

(At least 4 car break ins this year, that i\u2019m aware of)\n\nWould also not recommend living on campus at all; $220 p/w for a dysfunctional shared (5 others) flat. Feel free to pm if you want me to list off the shitshow that is unilodge, i love complaining:)",

Seemed pretty bad value for the price, they sent a contract with alot of upfront fees just to sign. There was no option to go on inpection before signing. Thanks for the heads up! \n\nIs it hard to get accomodation in early feb.? Or would you recommend finding a place prior to arrival?",

The pros are it's somewhere to live, the cons are that Curtin generally doesn't support staying in student accom for several years, and tries to get people to move into rentals after their first year.",

But my understanding is that the longest contract you get is for a year, and they'll prefer new students over existing ones for the next year's contracts. It does make some kind of sense, new students are likely to find it harder to arrange accommodation when they're outside the country. Existing students are already here and have been here for a while, so it should be easier.",

Their leases are also very sketchy and they can inspect your rooms as often as they want. (WA rental law is 4 times per year max btw) I would definitely recommend a private rental over UniLodge if possible.",

    "postText": "tldr: Unilodge charged me a dishonest fee for their dishonest practise\n\nUnilodge currently does not provide an invoice for their rent (even if you request it). Recently, they decided to charge 3 weeks rent, which was not informed, instead of the usual 2 weeks rent and I had the accurate rent for my 2 weeks payment in that bank account. Received a charge by them for $6 tagged as a dishonest charge and they want to fine me another $10 for not paying my rent in time. Kind of contradictory to charge a dishonest fee :/\n\nQuick search on Unilodge and you can see other dishonest practises they have done such as underpaying their workers or not even paying at all, witholding and not refunding bond.\n\nRecently, they decided to charge someone $195 for cancellation fee by direct debit, even though they already finished their lease, moved out and did not even signed the contract to stay another year.\n\nDoes Curtin University even care about the partners they are working together with or is this just pure greed?\n\nAnyone else having problems with Unilodge?",

When I went to pay on the portal, they tacked on $6 for an \u201cadministrative charge\u201d and then the direct debit went through the day after (it was later reversed). Essentially, they made me pay four weeks of rent for a two week period. Would not recommend.",

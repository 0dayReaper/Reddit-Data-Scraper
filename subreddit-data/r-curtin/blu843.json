I've heard about honours invitations even in my own courses but I never got a formal one even though my marks were high enough. Instead it was either sent out as an email with a pdf explaining honours and what you can do or it was an open information session and after that you kind of had to find your own way with contacting staff members you wanted to work with.\n\nIf you can try and find out who the honours coordinator is for commerce and you can ask them about your marks and for some honest advice. From what you've given us I'd say you're borderline. You'll definitely need to bump your marks up but depending on the entry requirements it might not be by that much",

    "postText": "Hi, this is ideally a question for graduates of Curtin or those who have relevant knowledge\ud83d\ude05\n\nI graduate from Curtin this year with my ceremony next year. I\u2019m doing an honours degree and at the moment and I\u2019m sitting on a second class honours unless I somehow (miraculously) get a really high HD on my final thesis and oral defence. \n\nNow this isn\u2019t a problem for me, I\u2019m really proud of maintaining a good average over four years especially with COVID affecting most of it. However, my dad has been gunning for me to excel from the first day I started and he\u2019s keen on me getting first class. \n\nI was just wondering what they include on your diploma when you graduate? Do they include the honours class on it or does it just say Honours? Also, during the ceremony, I know they are done by faculty but does that mean when they call out names by discipline, they also include the honours class you graduate with?\n\nIf anyone who knows or knows anyone who\u2019s graduated recently with honours could shed some light that would be srsly appreciated \ud83e\udee1",

I didn't pay enough attention to remember anyone else's announcement but I'm pretty sure they still put 'second class' on your cert as I've seen other degrees from curtin with this written on them.\n\nShe graduated with a bachelor of science if that's useful information at all. Also, your dad didn't get the degree, so no worries about what he says. Congratulations on being so close to graduation!",

I was wondering how this was gonna work for other classes as well actually so this answered the question my friends and I were thinking of \ud83d\ude0c I definitely thought it would be a bit awkward if they announced upper second class, lower second class, and third class in front of everyone\u2019s families \ud83d\ude05",

Back in 2017, &gt;80 is considered HD and to be on the vice chancellor list, you have to score a minimum of &gt;85.\n\nThe distinction between 1st and 2nd class honours comes into play if you are planning to apply for PhD scholarship where 1st class honours is a requirement. Other than that, Honours is honours.",

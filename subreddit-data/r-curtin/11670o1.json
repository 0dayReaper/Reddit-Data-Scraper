I want to do both computer science and cyber security, is this possible? if so would it be a double degree or a double major? either one works haha.",

            "comment": "Hey there I\u2019m a 3rd year soft eng student at Curtin, comp sci is very computer theory based where soft eng is more practical in a sense that you will learn techniques and common practices used to create software, cyber again is quite theory based but more informative about potential threats and how to best protect against them.\n\nAll pathways will have overlapping core units, so you will do pretty much the same stuff over your degree.\n\nBut remember uni isn\u2019t really for learning, it\u2019s about exposing you to an environment where you need to learn yourself, as this field is such a rapidly growing one. This understanding will help you succeed in any of these pathways. \n\nMake your decision over the year and don\u2019t feel rushed to choose right now, keep exploring sub sections of the computing field and use different technologies to see what really grabs your attention. It\u2019s also very easy to switch between pathways as you go, so don\u2019t feel constrained by your choice.\n\nI hope this has helped, and if I\u2019ve got anything wrong or didn\u2019t explain it well please feel free to correct me :)",

I studied Cyber at ECU and I learned significantly more on my own and from my peers than any unit I have studied. \n\nGet uni done quick and get into the industry.",

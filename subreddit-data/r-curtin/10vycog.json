I\u2019m a 2nd year mechatronics engineering student, and off the top of my head it goes something like: Uni ready -&gt; multidisciplinary science -&gt; transfer into engineering if your grades are high enough. The uni support staff will be able to give you much more detail though.",

Is there anything you recommend I look into before starting the course? How advanced would my understanding of maths have to be - is math specialist really that important? Is it enjoyable or mainly stressful? I am mainly looking at it for the robotics aspect so would you say this course heavily centres around doing robotics or should I maybe look to UWAs Automation and Robotics course?\nI would really appreciate if you could answer a few of these questions for me.",

I think the course was a Diploma of Civil and Structual Engineering, or something like that. They went straight into second year uni as they got credits for the TAFE course units. Not sure if this is still a thing now though, this is almost 20 yrs ago. Typing this has made me feel old.",

    "postText": "Graduated from highschool this year,\n\nreceived an early offer and accepted the offer\n\ntried finding my curtin ID which is allegedly on my letter of offer, my confirmation of acceptance or other emails from the uni\n\nAll emails I've recieved have used my first name and the closest thing to the curtin id was my TISC numbers, which apparently i can use to activate of OASIS account but its not working no matter what i do.\n\nCurtin website sucks for details and help on this tbh. Was wondering when enrollments for courses in 2023 open and roughly when i would receive my curtin ID\n\nthanks",

Normally if graduates want to apply to Curtin undergraduate medicine, they would use the notional ATAR from their GPA.\n\nAs my highschool ATAR will be better than my notional ATAR, is it possible to apply to Curtin undergrad with my highschool ATAR (scaled from 97.15 to 99.95 due to the highschool I went to), and not applying with my notional ATAR?",

Have you gone out of your way to contact your coordinators/tutors or the uni for support? \n\nLike what's the reason for your low marks? If your just barely passing then that's an issue, if your just missing a couple of marks it doesn't hurt to each out to them for solutions. ATAR really doesn't mean jack shit once you've already started studying your current undergrad.",

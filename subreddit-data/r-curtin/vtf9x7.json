IRIS exists because almost every single institution that accredits Curtin's degrees (i.e. gives them actual value) requires a certain ratio of \"invigilated\" vs \"non-invigilated\" assessments, and IRIS is the least shitty solution they have to the problem of online invigilation. \n\nI see from your other comments that you're an off-campus student, do you have a proposed better solution to having a university staff member watch you take the assessment? IRIS exists to avoid the alternative of having an army of low-paid invigilators literally sitting and staring at everyone's live webcam feeds. Instead there's an automated system which flags mostly false positives for one person to go through and review at the end of the assessment. Lower cost, lower effort, probably more effective.",

I couldn't help myself.\n\n&gt;I mean i guess i can understand but i am still uncomfortable with it, id even be uncomfortable with someone watching me through my webcam at any time\n\nUnfortunately this is the requirement that defines invigilation. Curtin's previous policy was \"be on campus so we can look over your shoulder, no exceptions\". COVID required them to come up with an alternative solution, and this is what they had. I've spent some time thinking of alternatives, and have asked others who don't like IRIS to do the same. Never have I or anyone I've spoken to actually been able to come up with a solution. So, I end up at \"IRIS is the least bad solution so far\". I imagine this is the same view held by most of Curtin, it sucks but all other options suck more.\n\n&gt;how would this work for someone of aboriginal or torris straight islander background?\r  \n\r  \nNot trying to be culturually insenstive or anything here but i believe there is a belief held by many that a photo or a video recording of yourself is some pretty bad juju, forgive my ignorance on it all.\n\nI've never heard of this. I spend a non-zero amount of time around aboriginal people and no-one I've met have ever expressed this nor have I noticed them avoiding it. I don't (to my knowledge) interact with anyone of TSI descent on a regular basis so I can't even begin to comment there. But, if I take your statement at face value (and I have no reason not to), I would expect that Curtin would fall back on the policy it held up until 2020: \"Be on campus\". Plenty of students have Access Plans that don't allow for online assessments, so solving the problem is then as easy as having you sit the test with them. The issue arises from being an online student unwilling to take an online assessment under the criteria imposed on Curtin by the accrediting institutions.\n\n&gt;mind you this is for a multiple choice quiz.\n\nThis is largely unimportant.  What's important is that it is supervised. For example, the ACS (who accredit Curtin's computing degrees) require two invigilated assessments for most units, which is what leads to the typical unit structure of an exam and a midsem, both either in person or IRIS invigilated, and an assignment which is not invigilated. There are some exceptions, but for the most part this is how it is. If Curtin stopped using IRIS for online assessments, ACS would cease to accredit our degree, significantly lowering it's value. If the engineering degrees weren't accredited by EA then they'd be basically worthless, and when the law school first opened it took some time to build momentum because whoever accredits those degrees wouldn't do so until the first cohort had graduated (therefore there technically wasn't a guarantee that your degree would be worth anything at the end).\n\n&gt;Just feel like being forced to install this software on my computer period is something that makes me extremely uncomfortable.\n\nIf you can scrounge together the liquid funds, my best recommendation would be to pick up a used computer off Gumtree, use it for the assessment, and flip it afterwards. Failing that, a separate boot partition on your primary computer with nothing on it, and then encrypt both partitions separately. Boot into the secondary OS only for taking IRIS assessments.\n\nNot the best solutions in the world, but best I can come up with",

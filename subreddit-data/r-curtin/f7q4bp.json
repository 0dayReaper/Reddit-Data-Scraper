    "postText": "Hi, \n\nJust wondering if there is anyone that has successfully course switched into radiation science as I have done confusions that I need to clear up. I am currently first year in multidisciplinary science and couldn\u2019t get an offer for imaging due to my lack of physics ATAR. I have took the quiz that they have give me and it stated to pick physics foundation unit for semester two and that is what I have done. Is this correct? Which score do they actually take into account when I apply? My semester One or Two results? The course coordinator sent a template after I enrolled and it stated to do physics foundations in semester One? I have contacted her and she has said that if I apply in August it will be an conditional offer. Have a make a terrible mistake. I was really confused as she did not send any plans for semester Two?  Just for reference I have completed Math Methods ATAR. \n\nPls Help I am so lost.",

Avail yourself of the counseling service and tutoring next semester\n3. Find a cozy spot you like to study in on campus and don\u2019t go home until you have done some work for the following week after a class. When you finish the class you do the work.\n4. Find a study buddy",

You'll probably be allowed to continue, but they might set limits on how many units you can enrol in, or make you pass certain core units before continuing, or ask you to attend support sessions and make a plan to improve. \n\nIf you are a domestic student, you'll need to be careful not to lose your HECS next semester: https://www.studyassist.gov.au/help-loans-commonwealth-supported-places-csps/low-completion-rate\n\nI agree with the other commenters who said to talk to guild or counselling. Make sure you've sorted out whatever caused you to fail before you re-enroll. You can always defer for six months if you need time to get into a position when you can study successfully.",

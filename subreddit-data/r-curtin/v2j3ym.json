            "comment": "I've looked at studying at both Curtin and Deakin and found researching the following areas very helpful in my decision-making process;\n\nNearly all curriculums are nationally standardised, especially true for core Engineering disciplines, so \"Who delivers the best curriculum\" wasn't a factor to me.\n\n- Social Clubs.\nCurtin's Student Guild, personally, seems much more active and influential, with a broader range of clubs and interests, better representation across demographics and a greater history of student-first activism on campus.\n\n- Accommodation.\nHow likely are you to find affordable accommodation in the area of your chosen campus?\n\n- Employment.\nHow likely are you to find casual/part-time work and will it pay what you require for the experience you have? Not post-grad, but whilst you're studying.\nIf you don't need to make an income, then what's cost of living like in Vic vs WA?\n\n- State Culture.\nVictorians and Westralians have cultural differences. Perth is easier to navigate by yourself, Melbourne has better public transport. Crime rates in both states are different, entertainment in both is largely similar but Perth is more emergent whereas Melbourne is more established.. an individual has greater potential to make greater personal impact in a lower-populated city, whereas an individual has greater ability to find more like-minded groups in a larger-population.\n\nPerth is prettier. More parks, better beach, arguably the ice epidemic is more noticeable. People are, subjectively, friendlier and easier-going.\n\nMelbourne is busier. People are, subjectively, more interested in what you can offer them. More variety for niche interests, but more competition for everything as well.\n\nAlso, you could look into the Academic contributions of each Uni in the Engineering field. The engineering facilities on offer at both.\n\nThese are all factors I took into consideration and found Curtin to be more in-line with where I want to take my Engineering Degree (industrial processes, automation and robotics/mechatronics).\n\nHope you reach a decision you're happy with and can persevere to make it work for you :D",

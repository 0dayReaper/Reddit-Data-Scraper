No supps means that if you sit an exam, that's it. If you have extenuating circumstances that occur right before an exam you should get a doctors note or other appropriate form of evidence for the situation and take it to the lecturer/UC at the exam venue so that they can excuse you and you can make alternate assessment arrangements (which are still in place) rather than trying to sit the exam and hoping for a supp if it doesn't go so well.",

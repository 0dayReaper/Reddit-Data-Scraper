I have a windows desktop at home if that changes anything.",

You can run Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10, (avoid Windows 11 for now), and run most distros of Linux in a container for your CS studies, or run as a VM in VirtualBox or similar.",

I can confirm with 100% certainty that it won't matter for CS (since I've been through that degree), and I'd be fairly surprised if it mattered for mechatronics. Doubly-so because you already have a windows machine at home, so worst case if there's one unit that uses windows-specific software you can still do that at home or uni, just not fully on the go (unless you set up remote access to home).\n\nIMO I'd get the M1 if you can swing it, simply because they're objectively the best laptops on the market. The job of a laptop is to allow you to do stuff on the go, and nothing does that better than the M1 gear right now. Battery life well in excess of a full day is by far the best feature for a uni laptop.",

You won't be able to get around that by just remote desktopping into your home computer. You might be able to get around that by running Windows in VirtualBox on a Mac, but expect to get no help from anyone in getting that working.\n\nSo, from the perspective of your degree, get the Windows machine.",

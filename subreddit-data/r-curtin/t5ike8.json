If you don't have a plan for the goal or career your degree is supposed to help you achieve, id recommend taking a break to figure it out. rather than immediately swapping.\n\nSchool of business has a unit called strategic career design which is focused on helping people decide the right path for them, i think the content was great and it helped alot for people who properly engaged with it.",

Do you know if it\u2019s hard?\n\nThanks for your input btw :))",

Maybe theres something you would actually enjoy.\n\n  \nIn saying all that, going to uni is an expensive (long term) way to live, perhaps moving out would be cheaper in the end. Sorry if this is too personal, but if you do have serious long term diagnosed mental health difficulties then engaging with the NDIS system and attempting to access the disability pensions might give you the resources to do that, instead of burning all this money on uni.  \n\n\nJust something to think about, feel free to not respond if you dont want to. I know that these types of things are much easier said than done.",

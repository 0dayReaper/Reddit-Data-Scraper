Basically there is no difference in quality between hons and masters in terms of research referencing and writing. The difference comes from the expected level of novelty in the work. For your hons you don\u2019t need to be doing anything new or novel. If you work logically back up your arguments and write clearly you will do well Source: I did hons did well went straight to PhD and now work in research",

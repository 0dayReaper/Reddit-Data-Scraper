    "postText": "hi!!! i\u2019m planning on purchasing an escooter cos my classes are far apart from one another and frankly i\u2019m a lazy mf. i\u2019ve also been a few students riding them around but never had a chance to speak to them. \n\nwas wondering how y\u2019all who have ridden it at curtin do with it once ur in class?\n\n i don\u2019t wanna lock it up outside cos my previous bike got stolen \ud83d\ude2d eventho it was locked. am i allowed to bring it into class? do i need to just fold it or do i need to fold and put it into a bag? if so what bag? and let me know if y\u2019all have had lecturers that had an issue with it.\n\nEdit: Called the uni up and they said I can store it in the bike pods which is much safer than locking it outside. That\u2019s great.",

Another student had an e-skateboard and some staff even rode my scooter up and down the hallway in 407. But defs ask the tutors first if they mind.\n\nRegarding riding around campus, with the red bricks and many slow, neandering pedestrians its not easy. People will walk into you and make it seem like its your fault.",

There is simply too much content to just pick out main parts of it just to pass. Way too risky. It\u2019s very relevant to psych especially the anatomy of brain, nervous system function etc. \nI didn\u2019t pass high school science and got an 85 in this unit, the key is don\u2019t get behind, go to all classes, and lots of repetition of concepts until you know it either verbally, writing or drawing so it sticks in your brain. The little online videos and quizes , Kahn academy, rewriting lecture notes were all helpful. Unipass is popular too.",

I recommend doing the practice test questions on the online anatomy textbook as well as the booklets they provide in tutorials, those were super helpful. Also attend the unipass they do lots of practice questions and help you out there :)) the actual textbook is also helpful for the open book exams",

Makes sure that you prepare the content before the class. There\u2019s some concepts that are a bit hard to understand, eg: Kerb Cycle. Do not just memorize it, instead, understand it. There\u2019s a lot of resources on YouTube, such as osmosis and Dr Mike. Attending UniPass is so helpful as well. Good luck with your study.",

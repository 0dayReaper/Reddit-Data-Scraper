            "comment": "Honestly, as an IT Professional, computer engineering degrees are dead! Don't waste 3 or 4 years learning stuff that is obsolete before you graduate. The industry wants AWS and Azure certs, powershell, python, json. Lambda, CIDB, the days of a comp science degree are over!\nNetwork engineering is very hot right now as long as you pour your CCNA with  AWS VPC",

            "comment": "\nUnix and C is a unit that you have on your timetable, and that is also one most computer science students do. \n\nWhile Fundamentals of programming isn\u2019t on many computer science pathways at Curtin, it is also another unit that teaches a lot about Python programming and Object Oriented programming so you should have fun there. \n\nDefinitely look into Data Structures and Algorithms. It\u2019s a first year computer science unit at Curtin and definitely builds the basics for further years and general computing concepts.\n\nI would also look into databases and SQL, as that\u2019s covered in later years and has helped me a lot with other understanding around concepts. \n\nI\u2019d probably also look into networking/computer communications too.",

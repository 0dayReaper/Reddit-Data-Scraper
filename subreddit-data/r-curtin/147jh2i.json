    "postText": "I am fairly certain I have failed one of the units I'm studying this semester and I've already had the exam. Is there a way to get the academic penalty removed for mental health reasons? \n\nLast year in October I was on exchange studying in another country when I required surgery to fix a medical issue I had been having. This was expensive and frightening because it wasn't an english speaking country and I lived alone with no one I could really rely on, and because of the nature of the surgery and some preexisting medical conditions I wasn't able to leave my home for more than a few hours at a time. I came home as soon as the semester there ended near Christmas feeling depressed about everything that had happened, especially since I had been waiting to go on exchange for years due to the pandemic. Once I got home the ongoing recovery from the surgery had a problem and I needed to have surgery again, in about week 3 of this semester. It continued the problem of not really being able to leave home for more than a few hours at a time and I am still in recovery now, and will be for at least another month. This has prevented me from attending many lectures and tutorials, and has lead to pretty poor performance all semester. I usually do fairly well and have a CWA of about 76. Would I be able to have the academic penalty removed? I am a fourth year engineering student but I'm not currently doing my thesis.\n\nTL;DR I haven't been able to leave the house for more than a few hours at a time since November, making it difficult to not be depressed and attend uni. I usually have good marks, is it possible for the penalty to be removed?",

The reason I say it's unlikely is you've had plenty of bail-out opportunities that you've missed:\n\n1. Deferring the semester entirely\n2. Withdrawal before the census\n3. Withdrawal after the census\n4. Attempting a Withdrawal Under Special Circumstances before the exam\n\nUnfortunately doing it after looks like hedging your bets a bit, as if you'd done well in the exam you wouldn't be applying. That said, I don't believe there's much risk in trying so might as well. Best to get on it soon though, before results come out as that would look even worse.",

            "comment": "Hey, I took these units. I have put a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nThey are both really hard and you need to keep up with the content. Just taking notes is not enough, you NEED to have established a way to learn anatomy or do so ASAP as both units move quickly through the content. They are taught really well imo the content is just a lot. \n\nI had Amanda for Limbs. In the tute we covered biomechanics (you must attend as worksheets are not posted online). She gets you up and moving which is helpful and has videos of her doing movements. In the lab the demonstrators were extremely helpful, i forgot their names :(. Have your anatomy down packed before the lab and try and get through some of the questions before you get to the lab. In the lab work with someone, quiz yourself, get through every single thing and ASK questions. After each week you must do active recall or something to remember content because you move on. Semester is split into 2 halves, 1st = lower limbs 2nd = upper. Tests are 50% each, I found there was enough time though. Overall, the content is ok but it is A LOT you move on VERY QUICKLY so you need to know how to learn anatomy and stay on the ball. \n\nI had Gary for Trunk. I found the embryology harder than the anatomy. The tute is mostly embryology and he moves fast but does let you ask questions. As for labs and content it's the same as above...very full on and you need to get through things before you come to lab, make sure to ask questions. Gary has exam style questions at the labs too (puts the answers up at the end) but he prefers you get through the actual lab content first. He often did \"rounds\" where he moves around to student/s at stations and asks them exam questions which are helpful but embarrassing if you have't got through the content/ have it somewhat down pack. \n\nTLDR: both are hard but taught well, I would recommend taking limbs over trunk as I found limbs a bit easier. Either way make sure you come prepared to the labs, ask questions, quiz yourself, work with another person and have the content mostly learnt by the end of the week.",

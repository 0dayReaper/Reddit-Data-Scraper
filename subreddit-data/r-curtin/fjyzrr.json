    "postText": "Just got an update from the Vice-Chancellor regarding what's happening:\n\n&gt; Curtin introduces additional COVID-19 pandemic safety measures\n\n&gt; On the weekend, the Prime Minister announced additional measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Curtin is now introducing a series of social distancing measures to help reduce the risk of transmitting the virus while keeping our University operating. \n\n&gt; **Changes to teaching:**\n\n&gt; The Elizabeth Jolley Lecture Theatre (our largest) was closed from 8am today. We are now moving to close all our lecture venues and make lectures available only online (via iLecture). \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; **By Friday 20 March all lectures will be available only online.**\n&gt; \n&gt; We also planning for classes and tutorials to be moved online in the event of further Government restrictions. We understand the difficulties associated with laboratory/studio work and clinical placements, and we are currently exploring options for how these course requirements can be managed in the event that further restrictions are imposed.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n**&gt; Events:**\n&gt; \n&gt; We have decided that it is no longer wise to continue to host events on campus, or to have our staff or students attend external events related to their Curtin work or study. This is in line with decisions taken by most of the education sector and the broader community. We will also be cancelling all public events involving our venues, such as community meetings and sporting events, and the Curtin Student Guild will be cancelling a number of planned social activities.\n&gt; \n**&gt; Travel:**\n&gt; \n&gt; We have already given clear directions about international travel. These restrictions now apply to interstate travel and unless travel is essential it will not be approved. Any approvals for University-related interstate travel by students will need to be sought through your course coordinator. \n&gt; \n&gt; The Australian Government has last night directed that all travellers entering Australia would be required to self-isolate for 14 days regardless of which countries they have come from. Violations of this could incur fines of up to $50,000.\n&gt; \n**&gt; Health and hygiene protocols:**\n&gt; \n&gt; Curtin has provided information about the best health and hygiene protocols to practise both at work and at home, to minimise risk to yourself and your family from COVID-19. Please see this information here. \n&gt; \n&gt; We are receiving many questions from staff and students about whether they should stay at home or self-quarantine. We have taken Government medical advice and developed a \u201cdecision tree diagram\u201d for staff and students to easily understand the recommended response to potential exposure to COVID-19 or general cold or flu. We encourage all members of our community to refer to this diagram if they have any doubt about their health status or have questions about whether they should attend campus or not. \n&gt; \n&gt; I want to thank all our students for their patience and understanding as we work together to resolve issues and plan for the best outcomes for our whole community. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Professor Deborah Terry AO\n&gt; \n&gt; Vice-Chancellor",

I got an email from hockey wa that says everything is suspended until the end of may, so schools could be next. I\u2019m not entirely sure what about the country, but I\u2019ve heard that some unis are shutting down.\n\nMy only concern is people who are going on pracs, as if they get cancelled, people will most likely have to repeat units.",

I don't feel like any of us would get any benefit from it when the whole point of the first 2 week prac is to get used to the school environment, get used to planning and standing in front of a class for a little bit at the end. You can't really get the full benefit if you're doing everything remotely",

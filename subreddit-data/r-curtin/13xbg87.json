    "postText": "I have currently selected Japanese for Beginners (JAPN1000) as my elective unit next semester (the fully online course). I did Japanese as my language in primary school and remember how to do hiragana and most katakana. I was wondering if anyone has done the course and if so, is it a hard to score well in?",

            "comment": "I just did this unit this semester, Hiroshi is a great teacher and you're likely to get him next semester, if you already know hirigana and katakana the first few weeks may be too easy for you as it's just introducing those characters, but this unit is good for basic sentence structure, learning some basic Kanji and some basic \u3044 and \u306a adjectives. But be aware of the vocab checks, you'll get it on the first week, it may overwhelm you (it did for me) but try to keep the vocab check sheets you work on, as it's in a section of the test at the end of semester (well it was this semester it's likely to happen next semester too) so I hope this is a helpful heads up. This unit does feel rushed and you will be made to do an assignment in 2-3 days, so make if you work part time like myself, you gotta drop your hours for this unit or hope to gosh you can get an extension \n\nHopefully this was helpful! \n\nPS: make sure you have a printer, you need it to print off the reference sheets for each week and for the hirigana, katakana and kanji booklets",

            "comment": "Why do you want to do it. If the answer is to get a pass in a unit, go ahead. If the answer is to learn Japanese, my opinion is learn a romance language instead. I studied alot of Japanese and it's only useful in Japan and then most people you would interact with speak English. \n\nSpanish\nPortuguese\nFrench \nItalian\n\nWay way better options if your an English speaker.\n\nEstudiar is study in Spanish\nUniversaidad",

I also enjoyed it in primary school, however, I'm currently on a scholarship and don't want to choose a unit that is too hard to score well in. Hence, I'm here trying to get some opinions on whether I should stay with this unit or not XD",

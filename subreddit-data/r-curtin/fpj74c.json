I want to do my PhD next year in biological sciences but i know i am not competive enough with a h2a and no publications.\n\nIs it possible for me to volunteer in a lab for free and hopefully be included in some papers as co author just so i could increase my chances.\n\nOr do university generally dont do such a thing.\nI am based in Melbourne but more than happy to move if it makes a difference.\n\nOr what is the next best way to be inckuded as a co author\n\nKind regards",

Might be a good chance to learn R, Python or another useful open source software. \n\n\nAny more refinement of your interests beyond \"biological sciences\"?",

    "postText": "I parked my car in one of the disability bays near building 301 without an ACROD permit around 8.45pm today and unfortunately got fined 10 minutes later. I know I shouldn't have done that but there were plenty of other disability bays available and all the 30 minutes parking were taken so I had no choice but to park there as it was the closest to the library. My friend had a bad fall and twisted her ankle earlier today so she was limping and couldn't take the bus home.   \n\n\nWe are both broke students supporting ourselves and definitely cannot afford a $200 fine :/ please help me with my appeal.",

            "comment": "is the ticket still issued by curtin? if so go through the appeal process written on the ticket. Explain that you needed to quickly pick up an injured friend and that there were no other spaces close by and that your friend couldn't walk.\n\nThe ticket inspectors/fine appeal people are really nice (I've had 2 fines overturned from forgetting to turn cello park on until later in the day + 1 more from when i was asleep in the car and they issued the ticket without seeing me)\n\nIn future if something like that happens again id recommend calling security (9266 4444) they will happily give you a ride from anywhere on campus to any car park either if you are injured or if it's just super late at night. That way your friend wouldn't have to walk at all.",

            "comment": "You're in a tough spot, parking in disabled bays isn't like parking in a normal bay that you're not supposed to. There are plenty of other ways you could have solved your problem (you can park in purple bays out of hours, you could have had your friend come out to meet you so you didn't need to park, etc.). I feel bad for you, but unlike every other parking fine Curtin puts out, fining people illegally parked in disabled bays isn't a money grab and is very important to keep those bays available for those in legitimate need.",

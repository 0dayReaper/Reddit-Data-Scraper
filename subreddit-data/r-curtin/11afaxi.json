I would really appreciate some recommendations so I can start to budget for it.",

            "comment": "Not architecture-specific but right now there's a strong argument that the M1/M2 macbooks are the best laptops on the market. The primary purpose of a laptop is to be portable, therefore battery life is the primary concern once you pass the minimums required to get your work done. \n\nIf you're a new student, don't rush to get anything yet. Wait until you've started and can get a better feel for it. The university has computers, and university study long predates the invention of computers. You can always take notes by hand, and then use lab PCs when you need it.",

            "comment": "5th year arch student. The CAD lab computers are decent for work outside studio but I\u2019d recommend a laptop of your own for class and at home. Get a laptop with a decent cpu, gpu and 16GB ram minimum. You\u2019ll need it for Revit/Archicad and renderings. Got myself a Metabox with an RTX3060 for the start of last year and has been really good for me. Been doing stuff in VR and videos for my projects which got me a few extra marks",

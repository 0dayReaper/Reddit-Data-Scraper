    "postText": "Hey, I'm a second-year uni student, interested in taking a post-grad in dentistry. I've been studying quite hard, but I haven't be able to improve my GPA. I'm not sure whether I'm using an ineffective study techniques. I find that I do well throughout the semester, but when it comes to the final exams, I plummet to credits.\n\nWhat does everyone do in term of studying techniques? What have you guys found that works the best?",

If you're doing something in the biological or chemistry based sciences than you'll need to incorporate effective memorisation techniques (spaced repetition, etc). If you're studying anything in the humanities than you need to really nail those essays and written assignments. It varies quite significantly between majors.\n\nI will say this though. If you're in 2nd year and you've been averaging credits than by the time you graduate your GPA wont be competitive at all, even if you do get all HDs from here on out. I'm not trying to crush your dreams, you can still do it, but you'll likely need to an honours year, post-graduate, or even another bachelors. \n\nIf you're very serious about dentistry, I would highly consider dropping your study load to part-time and spending this semester honing in your study techniques. \n\nI would also advise you to consider the fact that you are going to require further study after this degree, if you're seriously committed to achieving this goal.",

I have a browser add-on that blocks time-wasting websites called BlockSite. \n\nIt's probably better if you describe your study methods, so we can see what's not working for you.",

Email your unit coordinators and ask if they have any exam/test materials from earlier years. I've done it before and they were really helpful (some of them just posted them to Blackboard for everyone to use)!",

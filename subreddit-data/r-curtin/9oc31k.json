    "postText": "Hi all\n\nI\u2019m currently doing my marketing honours dissertation on video gaming and would like some help with collecting some survey data.\n\nTo make it worth your while I\u2019ve got five $20USD Steam cards to be given out to five lucky takers of the survey.\n\nTo be in the running, just make sure you enter your email address when prompted at the end of the survey. Your answers will be anonymous (unless you enter your email) and all answers will be kept confidential.\n\nYou can also sign up to be the recipient of a white paper based on the results of this research if you so wish.\n\nThanks very much!\n\n**Survey is now closed**",

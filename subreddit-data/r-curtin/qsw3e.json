    "postText": "Hey everyone! Hope your semesters have started well, and that you are ready to meet some fellow redditors at the tav.\n\nI was thinking that given we seem to have some new people, and to my knowledge we've not had a meet up in quite some time, we should start thinking about planning the organisation of a tentative meet up possibly.\n\nI think a Wednesday arvo/evening at the tav would be good, as then if things are going convivially we could continue on into wicked Wednesdays there.\n\nFeel free to add suggestions for dates or venues, or indeed to shoot down the idea completely. I also think that if/when we decide on something we should x-post to [/r/perth](/r/perth) to recruit any Curtin people who don't frequent this sub.\n\nCheers all.",

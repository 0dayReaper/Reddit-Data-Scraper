    "postText": "I just got an email from the Vice-Chancellor saying that next week is a tuition-free week while lecturers get ready to move everything online only. Here is the email if anyone is curious:  \n\n&gt; Dear ThirteenMoney,\n&gt; \n&gt; You would be aware that the Government has recently been reviewing its public health measures to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, including measures to increase the physical distances between individuals.\n&gt; \n&gt; We have been responding rapidly to these developments to ensure that you are able to safely continue with your studies. Actions taken to date at our Western Australian campuses include:\n&gt; \n&gt; All formal lectures have been moved to iLecture format, which means that they can only be accessed online. \n&gt; \n&gt; **By the week beginning 30 March, all units available fully online will be taught exclusively in this mode.**\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, we are making next week (the week beginning 23 March) a tuition-free week at our Perth campus.\n&gt; \n&gt; This will give you time to prepare for the online environment and to adapt to the other changes that we will make to the delivery of your units.\n&gt; \n&gt; It will also give our staff time to put units fully online and work through the more complicated issues around laboratory work, field work, studio sessions and the like.\n&gt; \n&gt; The two tuition-free weeks in April will continue as planned and we will add a teaching week to the end of this semester. This will mean that the study week and exam period are delayed by one week.\n&gt; \n&gt; ****We know that some areas of the University such as the Medical and Law Schools follow different academic calendars. If this impacts on the way in which the additional tuition-free week is managed, you will be informed directly by your Unit or Course Co-ordinator.****\n&gt; \n&gt; Throughout this period, all of our usual University services remain open.\n&gt; \n&gt; While these are difficult and unsettling times, I urge you not to lose sight of your university goals.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are working very hard to ensure that study remains a very viable and attractive option for you, especially at a time when many of your social, travel and work activities may not be available to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; **I also want to reassure you that, should your circumstances change during semester, we are committed to being as flexible as possible. To this end, we have decided to change the census date (withdrawal date) from Friday 20 March to Friday 3 April. Any student wishing to withdraw after the official date can apply for a \u2018special consideration\u2019 at any stage through Curtin Connect.**\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your patience as we work through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wish you and your families all the very best at this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Professor Deborah Terry AO\n&gt; Vice-Chancellor\n\nWith next week being a tuition-free week, and with all class moving online, I think lack of motivation is going to make fewer people watch the lectures/do assignments, but the census date has been moved back to the 3rd of April, so if anyone does feel like this is all too much/lack of motivation has made them unable to do anything, they have been given an extra week to consider leaving their course.",

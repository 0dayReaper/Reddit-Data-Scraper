            "comment": "Score well in your honours year and that will boost your overall grade significantly. Honours typically involves the research component which can be a hit or miss from a grade perspective. Make sure you pick a topic you can cultivate an interest in, research your supervisors before hand to see how much commitment they can give you. Consider also picking an area suited to where you want to go careerwise. Grades should follow through with  these considerations (most of the time).\n\nFor other units, stay on top of things, don't allow yourself to have unaddressed understanding - ask for help from lecturers persistently. Finding understanding is your responsibility, not your teachers'. With teamwork units, set expectation with them  (your aims, their aims and then find a middle ground) don't be afraid to have difficult conversations with them - better they come early than later (they will come eventually)",

You need &gt;79.95 to achieve first class honours.\n\nMost common is probably second class upper and lower. Would only recommend stressing about honours class if you don't already have a job or you're interested in pursuing further studies (Masters/PhD).",

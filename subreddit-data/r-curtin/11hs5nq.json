I received an email stating I attained Vice Chancellor's List membership (I didn't even know the award existed before reading the email). The reception is a couple of weeks before my final examinations. How prestigious is the award and is the reception worth the time and money for me to fly over there?",

It doesn't seem like it's important enough to fly over! I would save your money :) I'm sure you could request them to ship the lapel badge over to you as well!",

As for attending the reception, it ultimately depends on your personal priorities and financial situation. While the reception may provide networking opportunities and recognition, it's important to prioritize your academics and consider the financial costs of attending. If you decide to attend, I suggest looking into any potential travel restrictions due to the current situation.",

Tbh they were kinda cool but would I spend the money coming from yhe UAE to attend - probably not. However like the poster above said, if you can afford it why not? It will give you the chance to visit the Perth campus and perhaps meet some of the staff.",

All that happens is your name gets called out and you take a group photo on the stage with the rest of the recipients from your school. Not really much opportunity for networking because it's mainly just recipients and their families there. My partner has received it 4 times and only gone to 2 ceremonies. The first time there wasn't even a stage or photo. We probably wouldn't go again if we had any better plans, and we live about 10 mins from campus.",

            "comment": "Oooh nice work. I\u2019m also going to the ceremony in April for my post grad. I went last year for undergrad, and to be honest it\u2019s probably not worth the cost to fly over. Especially when you have exams soon. I would save it for graduation because they give you a cool little VC rope you have to wear (though keep an eye on it because it does slip off the robe easy) and acknowledge that you are on the VC list when you are called onto stage. \nThe VC ceremony is quite casual and there are a lot of people there. When you arrive they tick your name off the list you get given a VC pin badge. No real seating, more cocktail, and you do get called on stage and grouped in your study area. Because we already have our certificates sent out there are no certificates given. Then they do a group photo eg humanities all go up together. \nFood was just like a voucher system I think because we were still doing a little bit of Covid restrictions so instead of walking around cocktail food you had a little cardboard catered box of snacks and you do get a couple of drinks included. No official photography, there was a roaming like \u201cPhoto Booth \u201c style photographer that did instant printouts, and you could get a photo with the Vice chancellor seperate if you want. I took my certificate to the last one and got a photo with the VC, like she was handing it to me. It wasn\u2019t a huge night out just a few hours and it was all over. \nIf you are high achieving first year you\u2019ll most likely be on the list a few times before you graduate. When you get more than one they just acknowledge that you are a multiple recipient. Ahh also there is a big screen where your names just rotate through the night.",

The core academic writing and communication units were great in teaching expectations for your degree. And the electives were helpful in preparing me with foundational knowledge for my undergrad. \nIt helped me learn how to learn so to speak, and what the expectations are at Curtin for further studies. Plus I made friends I am still in contact with. \nThe course work isn't overly difficult, but like any uni units, you will have to dedicate time and effort to succeed. \nAll of my units required one two hour class per week, so eight hours total that I completed over 2 days. Hope this helps.",

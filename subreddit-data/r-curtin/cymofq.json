    "postText": "I have some RA work available (only ~ 2 hrs per day, but 7 days).\nIt would suit people who live on or very near (Bentley) campus and have an interest in environmental science or botany.\n\nThe project is related to pollen / thunderstorm asthma and involves maintaining a monitor that is on campus and pollen identification.\n\nThe work could be split between multiple people however you would need to be consistently available on specific days.\n\nIf you are interested send me a message with your email.",

Right now, their priority would be their current students. \n\nif the applications processing backlog is high and the number of people working in the admissions department is low, it can take a while.\n\nIf they prioritise application by date of entry (when you are starting) rather than when they receive them - and you aren't commencing until July, they likely won't get to it until June. \n\nIt isn't first in, best dresse dwith these things. \n\nWhat you can do if you want to speed things up and contact the course coordinator and ask about the turnaround times and, if you need to know sooner for some reason, let them know so they can reach out to admissions for you. \n\nOr go to ECU - their turnaround times are better and they are higher ranked than Curtin for student satisfaction :).",

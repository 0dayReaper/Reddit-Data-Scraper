Secondly, you're likely to get caught.\n\nPeople might be able to help you more effectively if you explain which part you're stuck on. Have you read the articles? Do you know how to work out the key points? Have you read/watched the material on how to synthesise?\n\nLearning how to ask good questions is a useful skill. Tell people where you're stuck, what you've tried, and what you're trying to achieve.",

It is usually recommended that it comes at the very end of the introduction, but really you can put it anywhere you want unless there are specific instructions on where to put it.\n\nThis is what you need to crack down at the very beginning of your essay planning. Your thesis will help you with all of your research and your themes that make up your body paragraphs. \n\nYour thesis must also respond to the question. If the topic question is asking, 'How is X related to Y?' You have a good scaffold to make a case for an argument. Your thesis statement is your side to the argument, either yes it does or no it doesn't. \n\nI think the main thing of this is communicate your tutor or coordinator. I can't stress this enough. You should have their contacts, and they always prefer students asking them or saying they're struggling instead of just handing in a bad assignment. \n\nAlso, as a note: be careful of academic misconduct. You can ask for advice, but never try to get anyone to write things for you.\n\n*EDIT: they're",

            "comment": "Before your thesis statement, write a bit to add some context, or other stuff, for the lack of a better word about your topic. \n\nThen you follow the OS + 3 formula for your thesis statement. Your OS (opening statement) states the position on the issue you take, and the + 3 represents your 3 main ideas which you will elaborate on in the body paragraphs.\n\nYour thesis statement should be direct and to the point. It should not use extra words to better fit within a word count. It should shortly state why you believe X, which will be elaborated on the body paragraphs, as opposed to implying or weakly stating X and explaining later.\n\nThis is probably not the best answer, I should have included examples, but I didn't because I'm trying not to fail UniReady myself and I should be working on my Math for Science instead of browsing Reddit.",

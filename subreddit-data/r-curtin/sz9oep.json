Timings also change so you could get 8am starts 3 days a week one semester and all late morning/afternoon classes another semester.\n\nThe key is to look at what classes have required attendance and which you can skip. Things like tutorials and practicals (e.g. science labs) generally you have to attend or if you don't you really should. But the advantage is they usually offer a couple of different times for these in most units. So you can try to align it so that you do as many required sessions back-to-back or close together as you can.\n\nSo say for example you have a tutorial from 9-10 and then a lab from 10-12 but you don't have a lecture until 4pm that day, you know you have to be in for the morning classes but if you have a part time job or just don't want to wait around for 4 hours you can go home and watch the lecture later. It's not like high school where you're forced to stay there regardless",

So it can still change from now till the 7th when they release the results. \nUnfortunately you can still have failed one class but nailed the other 3 so it's hard to predict.\nIt's a pain waiting for the results when your not sure how you went in a class...",

If every time the cwa change means a final mark for a unit is released into the system, I think I probably failed a unit because from my calculation a unit mark 40 something will change the cwa like this.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nWe're part of an organisation called JCI Eastern that hosts social and community events and provides consulting services to not for profits and charities.\n\nWe are currently conducting a survey for a not for profit regarding the perceived cultural gap in universities between domestic and international students. We have created a questionnaire in order to gain an understanding of why this gap exists and to look for ways to bridge the gap. We are also planning on sharing our survey results with Australian universities to provide them with data and possible solutions so as to make university life more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nHere is a link to the survey:\u00a0[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPxP-z5RxEktnm5Prz1gU3pb5\\_m5\\_j1Hg3k5au12P6X91XgQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPxP-z5RxEktnm5Prz1gU3pb5_m5_j1Hg3k5au12P6X91XgQ/viewform)\n\nThe survey only takes around 2-3 minutes to complete and you have the chance to win $50!",

    "postText": "The course that I\u2019m supposed to start next week has no options for elective units which is fine but i\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a way to study another unit on top of them. I see online that you can \u201coverload\u201d but does that mean just taking an elective ahead of time? The unit I want to do is largely unrelated to my course. Would there be any way for me to enrol it especially if i havent even started this course so they can\u2019t judge if i would be able to handle it i suppose.",

It's a thing you can do, but you can't HECS it and I don't think it's Commonwealth supported either (so you'd pay fees closer to the int'l fees than typical domestic fees). I'd be cautious of overloading in general, it can get pretty hectic",

Then just turn up. \n\nIf it's not for degree, there's not much point in doing the actual assessments",

    "postText": "I. Am. Overwhelmed. \n\nI got a letter of offer within the month of submitting my application (thru agent) for Master of Geospatial Intelligence but the tuition fee is expensive. The downpayment is already too much, then you got to factor in accommodation, food, transport\u2026 I\u2019m considering deferring, but i could lose my Merit Scholarship that came with the offer. \n\nI\u2019m really interested in the course, but moneywise, I\u2019m not sure how I can even survive\u2026",

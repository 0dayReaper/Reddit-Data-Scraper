    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm doing an undergraduate engineering degree at UWA and found the experience to be extremely theoretical with minimal practical experience (until master year where you have to get your own placement).\n I have heard from some random friends that engineering at curtin is much more practical and hand-on. When can you apply for the practical placement/internship work at curtin? How much does the uni assist you in securing a placement?",

            "comment": "At curtin you can find placements from 1st year. \nOnly differences are that youll need to get a min of 480 hours of work experience to graduate and the uni gives you practically no help finding them.",

Currently the degree at UWA doesn't seem to be teaching any practical engineering skills but I have heard that you get taught more in depth knowledge once you specialise in master. I'm only one year away from doing master so I'm not sure if transferring would be worth it. The practicality does sound attracting since I'm not very satisfied with UWA's theory-focused teaching which barely goes beyond high school knowledge imo.",

The workload is tough, but you defs learn alot.",

I don't really mind working on a thesis since I would have to do that in master anyway. Thanks for the advice I'll definitely look into the credit transfer now.",

But I hope that at least Curtin does the preparation a bit better than UWA and it's worth the transferring. Have you seen anyone transferring from UWA to curtin and didn't regret their decision?",

            "comment": "My perspective as a civil engineering student at Curtin:\n\n* There are a few labs for each class but usually these are pretty basic though they do give practical understanding of the theoretical aspects - Obviously this depends on what type of engineering you're doing.\n* As Antman stated, you need 480 hours of practical hours (internships/work) to graduate, there is the WIL program and other ways which you can get assistance with doing this however I just did it by myself. You can apply any time basically, I know people who have had internships during their first year summer.\n* Expect to do a lot of the learning yourself, in the civil department most of the lecturers are basically just researchers and imo they are not great at teaching.\n* Your employer is not going to expect you to know everything as an undergrad, that's why internships and grad programs exists and usually they are pretty forgiving and understand that you're not going to know everything with a bachelor's degree.",

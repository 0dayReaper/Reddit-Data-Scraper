I know a couple of others who do as well. I think it depends on what you want to do, but a career in policy seems to be common?\n\nIt\u2019s definitely worth speaking with Dr. Takao (the course coordinator). I think most people wait til the end of their degree to start speaking with their professors about career aspirations but it\u2019d be smart to have those conversations early on as well.",

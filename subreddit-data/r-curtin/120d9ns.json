            "comment": "Psychology is very research heavy. There will be lots of lab reports and reading journal articles. The content gets more interesting as you get more into the degree. As many people have already stated, you need to study for many years to work as a psychologist or alternatively pivot to adjacent careers. \n\nIt is a lot of work to get through all the required degrees if you want to be a clinical psychologist or an academic. You need to get high gpa in undergrad to get into honours, and then high gpa in honours to get into masters/phd. It's like never-ending stress.\n\nBut if you make it to the end, the job prospects seem pretty good. At least anecdotally speaking, everyone I knew since honours completed their masters and/or phd and have jobs in their respective fields. Even those who didn't make it into honours were able to pivot into other professional careers (although I wouldn't recommend only having a BA in psych).\n\nI originally wanted to be a clinical psychologist but decided to pursue a phd to work in research instead. I just started a research position, and I'm enjoying it so far. My friends working in clinical positions enjoy their work but tell me it's quite stressful.",

But errr, if you're going into it thinking you'll sort out your own trauma or whatever and \"self-discovery\" pppproobably not gonna be what you end up getting (if anything you'll get more trauma bc depending on your workload you might not have time for self-discovery \ud83d\ude02)\n\nIf it's just a general passion for the subject I think you'll enjoy it. In my units there were loads of essays and such on theory and principles, lots to remember, but it was interesting. \n\nYou should also maybe be prepared to go further than just BA, aim for Honors or higher otherwise there's not much you can realistically do with a BA in Psych. At least this was my experience, I could apply for Honors but they didn't accept me, which was for the best honestly bc my career passion changed. Not bc I didn't get into Honors but after going through the degree I just realised it's not what I want to do with my life \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I still study psychology independently, but not for a career or anything.\n\nAnyway, be prepared to read *a lot* of journal articles and whatnot, as well as any text books you're probs gonna be forced to buy \ud83d\ude02 By my 3rd year I gave up on text books and just went solo bc I didn't have the time to read all of that and by then was pre good at making it seem like I'd read the text books \ud83d\ude02 You'll figure out a way that works for you :pp\n\nOh but go to lectures if you can in person! Idk but this helped me loads to just \"stay in the loop\" and stay motivated to keep up.\n\nOne last thing: Your 2nd year might be the hardest, I noticed in my 2nd year sooo many Psych students dropped out or changed degrees. It was the hardest year for me too personally, I guess it's because the novelty of being 1st year has worn off and now it's just study, study, study, study, and can become redundant. Push through it though and get the degree anyway, it was worth it for me even though I'm not persuing a career in Psych (unless ofc like others you realise Psych really isn't for you then it's best to change degrees).\n\n[Beware the research proposals \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 they'll be introduced in 2nd year probably] \n\nAnyway good luck and have as much fun as you can! :DD",

Turns out Psych is much funner for me to study independently and I don't want a job in it \ud83d\ude02\n\nI guess I \"grew up\" a little throughout the 3 years of studying Psych (I was 17 in my 1st Yr), then I took a 1 Yr gap after graduation and started my own small business throughout the Covid happenings, and I developed an interest for business and now I'm studying that \ud83d\ude02\n\nOut of curiosity why are you studying Psych?",

Had pretty much the same experience coming straight out of high school (first year at 17), but yeah i chose psych as i guess i wanted to help people without having to be a doctor. Some other factors were things like the job couldn\u2019t really be replaced in the future, pay was good (that i heard). I originally wanted to do architecture but heard bad things about the uni degree. \nFunnily enough though my dream has always been to work for myself. i\u2019ve started up businesses in the past never really kept up with it. You might ask why i don\u2019t just do that \ud83e\udd23 but i have always thought it would be too insecure as a source of income, whereas atleast a degree i could get a job ect\u2026",

However, the work is rewarding, interesting, and varies/looks different depending on where you work.

You get paid doing these programs and they train in you in different areas. There\u2019s even more options I\u2019m sure but yes you don\u2019t have to do 5 + years of study to make your psych degree meaningful.

    "postText": "Hi everyone! As part of my clinical psychology studies I'm a co-investigator in research looking at mental health, sense of belonging, self-care behaviours, sleep quality and student drop-out among Australian university students. Adult undergraduate students (18+ years) studying in any Australian university are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire. The Participant Information Sheet/Consent Form is attached and tells you more about the research project. If interested follow the link below \ud83d\ude00\n\n[https://rmit.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_eUSgnGeq5m2eNZb?fbclid=IwAR3TwbVeQEmYTCEKw\\_DU8X77LzzqTzmojuuyAm090dBVBjuyjhNoywkj5y4](https://rmit.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eUSgnGeq5m2eNZb?fbclid=IwAR3TwbVeQEmYTCEKw_DU8X77LzzqTzmojuuyAm090dBVBjuyjhNoywkj5y4)",

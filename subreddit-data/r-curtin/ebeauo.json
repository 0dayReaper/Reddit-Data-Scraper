Call your course coordinator or head of school depending on which school you are in and see if you can complete a similar unit. Even better if you can find the similar unit yourself",

How would a unit only being available in S2 2020 stop you from graduating after completing S2 2019?\n\nHowever, if you can find an equivalent unit elsewhere (another faculty or uni) you can complete it instead and get credit, but get approval beforehand.",

If you did any of the above without checking with your course coordinator that it wouldn't screw anything up (like this) then you don't really have anyone to blame.\n\nIf this shouldn't happen, defs check up with your course coordinator and see what happened. The only likely scenario I can imagine is that they messed with the course layout and you got moved across without knowing. Or they changed the semesters a unit ran in without checking what courses that would break.",

From what I remember there\u2019s really only one unit other commerce students (banking, accounting) do that has calculus kind of math but from when I did my degree I didn\u2019t have to do it. I\u2019m pretty shit at math but if you basically memorise the formulas and know how to use them you\u2019ll be fine. Plus most of the time if you have in person exams you can bring notes so\u2026 not hard from a math perspective to pass. Happy to chat more if you want in DMs :)",

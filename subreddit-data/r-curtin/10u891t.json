    "postText": "So I'm a current Curtin student (Bentley campus) and I've recently been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). I know there's a stigma around this but don't worry, my case is pretty mild and all my symptoms are weird but not disabling me. I was wondering if anyone knew of any academics I could speak to who have done research regarding diet and exercise with MS??",

Is it to do research insofar as academically, or, just to know more about the condition you have just been diagnosed with?\n\nI ask, because academics are notoriously over worked (I used to be one at Curtin), and if you just want to know more about your condition and seek help, they will just point you towards an organisation. If you want to maybe do some research academically, I would highly suggest doing some research at the library first, read broadly and then read that specific academics articles. It would be quite disrespectful and time wasting (for seriously overworked and underpaid academics), to show up with questions you could have already answered by doing a little reading. Not trying to be rude, but what you are asking is potentially a meeting for free (especially if you are asking a tutor who is a casual employee) and also eating into someone else\u2019s very previous free time.",

Her book may as well have promoted standing on her head for 30mins a day, that has as much scientific merit. But I guess was profitable for her to play on the fears of sick people",

The side effects from chemo would massively outweigh any potential benefits. \nEating broccoli instead of pizza would be beneficial for most people to be honest, agree it would likely improve fatigue symptoms in MS sufferers, as well as the general population, so it has benefits, but to promote that diet as a cure for MS is akin to selling snake-oil, no amount of broccoli and Kale would have helped her without the chemo",

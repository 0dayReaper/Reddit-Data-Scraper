    "postText": "So i am an international student in Mcom in IT. This my first sem. I fucked up pretty bad. I.didnt study at all this sem. Didnt even provide more than one assignments. So i am failing in three courses. What will be the.consequence? \n\nMy problems are not with sudies. I am struggling to cope with a new environment. couldn\u2019t find a home near campus.  I gave up this sem. I want to turn it around in next sem. I have a 25% scholarship but i think its gone now. What kind of consequences will i  face? Will the uni ket me continue this course? If i retake these courses next sem will things be alright?",

But to answer your last question, yes it will all be alright.\n\nI don't know how you'll go next year, but people fail all the time and it's genuinely the best way to learn.\n\nI've led teams, I'm a professional consultant and I promise you those achieving great heights got there through failure.\n\nBe kind to yourself and don't lose sight of the bigger picture.",

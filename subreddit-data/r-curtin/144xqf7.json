            "comment": "Starting from last year, Curtin University has teamed up with a bunch of study-abroad agencies to really push their Master's program in Mining Engineering. There's been a flood of students from India and China signing up. They number in the hundreds. But here's the kicker - you can't get straight-up recognition from Engineers Australia when you graduate from this program. On top of that, all the juicy internship opportunities from the school are first up for grabs by the undergrads. They've got more time to make connections in the industry too. So, compared to them, you might find yourself coming up short. Right now, we're in a mining boom, but who knows what it'll be like when you graduate in a few years? It might be tougher to land a job, especially with the way the global economy's headed and with China's demand going downhill.",

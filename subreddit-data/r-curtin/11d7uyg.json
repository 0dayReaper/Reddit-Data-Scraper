Week one has only just started so give it some time, it always starts off with small talk but if you are vibing with someone feel free to ask for their instagram so you can keep in touch/share notes if the other can't make it to class. I started uni in 2020 and here are some tips I can offer:\n\n1. **find someone who looks approachable and strike up small talk.** If before class you could ask: are you here for X class, what are you studying, where did you go to school, do you know anyone here, can I sit at your table, etc. If during class you could compliment their clothes or ask for a \"review\" of something they own (personally I have 0 intention of buying a frank green bottle but I always ask ppl \"is that a frank green, I see it everywhere, is it good i've been wanting to get one?\". Just get the small talk started, if like the vibe then you can ask them more questions, what they are doing after class so maybe you can make plans and get their deets.\n2. **Be prepared to make \"unit friends\" and have low expectations.** Sometimes people drop off the face of the earth after the unit is over and that's ok but sometimes you do make friends for the rest of uni and beyond\n3. **Get involved,** whether that is joining a uni club or volunteering outside of uni\n4. **Take care of your mental health**, get a counsellor/psych if you can. I know Curtin has some (I don't go there personally so can't tell you much about it). Talk to your GP you might need a referral but most are very understanding. Uni can really do a number on your MH so hang in there and know that things do get better\n\nAll the best OP, I hoped that helped",

I met my best uni friend through a club related to our degree, so clubs definitely help. if your degree doesn\u2019t have many labs or workshops, definitely branch out. if not, just trust the process, make the small talk, eventually it comes out all good. \n\nworth asking someone you\u2019ve made small talk with to catch up for a study session too, especially if you\u2019re working on individual assignments. find a mutual gap in your schedule and it\u2019ll fall into place - i promise!",

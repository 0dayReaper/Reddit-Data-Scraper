I have a whooole bunch of questions but mostly just interested to see others' experiences studying online. Have I made a horrible mistake? How much group work can I expect, and how hard is the Academic Integrity module? Any tips/tricks/pointers/advice to run away screaming?\n\nI was also told I won't get my login info until the week before classes which is not helping my anxiety over the whole thing, but c'est la vie I suppose. \n\nI also have a couple of diagnosed mental health conditions so I'm wondering if I should liaise with AssistAbility before I start. If anyone has any experiences or advice they could share, it'd be much appreciated.",

            "comment": " Re: Mental health conditions, it\u2019s a great idea to have them documented before you start. Assist Ability should be able to advise how to prepare a Curtin Access Plan. This document outlines accommodations that can be made to your learning and assessments in the event that your conditions adversely impact your ability to participate in learning activities or complete tasks. If your don\u2019t require any accommodations, you don\u2019t have to refer to the plan. If you do experience mental ill health, you will not have to go through the process of obtaining the documents when you are already unwell.",

It\u2019s a learning curve for sure.  I don\u2019t know the specifics of your course, but in mine I\u2019ve had 3 group assessments that ended up being unexpectedly positive experiences for me because I actually met and made friends in the process.  The challenge with online learning is that you can feel kind of lonely, so I recommend participating in the discussion boards, maybe you could even start a WhatsApp group for students in your local area that you could meet for a study session?    As far as online study in general, I recommend staying on top of your work - do the readings, the activities and watch the lectures.  There will be a \u201clive\u201d tutorial probably and if you can make them, I recommend it.  You do have flexibility which is great when you are juggling work, family etc.  as for contacting the Uni about your situation, yes, do that.  It is a bit frustrating that you can\u2019t log on before the week before, but that is just how they do it.\n\nGood luck and happy studying!",

I am hoping to do the same someday although really I'd be happy if I can manage to keep going to get the full degree.\n\nI'm doing English &amp; Creative Writing (not necessarily for a career, but it's something I've wanted to do my whole life). I am definitely planning to dedicate the majority of my time outside work to study and watching as many lectures and tutorials as possible. And I enjoy the loneliness, so the less group participation the better, although hopefully I might surprise myself and make some friends.\n\nThanks again and best of luck to you as well!",

Choosing to do something you're passionate about is a great choice, and the skills you learn will be highly transferable. \n\nCurtin has its pros and cons but I would say their online offerings are a definite pro. My experience of the coursework during the course I just finished was very good, and I never felt like any of the assignments were too easy or too hard. \n\nRemember to give yourself time to rest and do things you enjoy, by the way. Not only is self care important in its own right, your brain needs time to process everything it is learning, so too much prolonged study can be counterproductive! \n\nGood luck!",

You can't get dates in advance, they hold on to logins until O-week so you can't plan around work and they are just a bit bumbling.\n\nThe second thing is USE ENDNOTE. Oasis, the student website will show you how but sit down and work it out because it's a life saver.\n\nThird, just log on and do a little bit each day. It'll get there for you and it'll be normal before you know it.\n\nGood luck!",

The online courses were easily the worst. Little motivation when sitting alone, no help from online lecturers, seemingly pointless group work, plus technical problems out the wahzoo. One of which wasted the 6 months i spent studying my cert 4 in business by denying me my certificate because on DAY ONE, my registration got messed up so none of the work I did counted. That being said I never went to curtain, and they have a better reputation than the mob i went to.  \nAs for the mental health side of things, ask yourself objectively if you are capable of doing the work without it. Judging by your post it sounds like you have anxiety issues? If that's the case, I would recommend going without the support. Having anxiety issues myself, I found that getting used to relying on your own efforts helps reduce anxiety levels in the long term, while having support in the course that most likely wont be available in the work your studying hopefully leads to can cause more stress in the workforce, and if you get a reputation in the industry as someone that requires mental aide, finding work will become that much harder.",

    "postText": "Hey there everyone, I hope you are doing well. I have applied for a PhD research position at Curtin University after being awarded a scholarship opportunity by one of its professors.\n\nWhile I wait for the application process to finish and hopefully start my studies in February 2020, I have to sort out travelling expenses. That is why I participated in the 2019 International Student Travel Video Contest.\n\nCould you please check out my video entry here https://www.internationalstudent.com/contest/2019/play/Yesterday%27s+Dream+%7C+Today%27s+Goal+%7C+Tomorrow%27s+Success/ and also vote for my entry if you liked it. If I get the most votes, I will get a guaranteed spot in the finals of the contest.\n\nThank you very much. Have a great day further.",

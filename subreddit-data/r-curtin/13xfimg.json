    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a first year eng student and I\u2019ve already confirmed failed one of my units (COMP1005) as I did not hand in one of the assignments (which was a pass requirement). The exams are coming up very soon and I was just wandering if I should try and get a decent score or if I should just tank the unit considering that I have already confirmed failed, as it would relieve stress and I can study for other units (although I have been told this would screw up my academic transcript). However, if I tank this unit my average would be absolutely horrendous (20ish%). I need advice for this, and was also wondering how the academic transcript actually works. Cheers.",

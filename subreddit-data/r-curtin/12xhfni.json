    "postText": "I've been doing a bachelor of psychology part time online, and I'm currently doing my 7th and 8th units, both first year. Just got handed my result for the first assignment in professional practice in psychology - 54%. Average was 60%. I have received some marks over 80/90% but this is the 5th assessment I've been given less than 60% for (2 of those being take home tests, yikes). I didn't even get full marks for referencing, for gods sakes, and i used apa 7 throughout my entire last bachelor degree. I was getting higher marks in my 3rd year units of that degree and I didn't put nearly as much effort in. I scour the marking rubrics. I follow the unit content religiously. I only use peer-reviewed research less than 5 yrs old. I'm beginning to think I'm just missing something that is necessary to succeed (need average of 80 to do masters so i don't like my chances anymore and am considering giving up now). I ask for feedback and get told my mark is deserved coz i didnt include this or that one specific sentence. Can anyone shed any light at all on what the hell i am doing wrong? What the hell are they even looking for??",

I actually wanted to cry just because, it was so insane to me! I, like you, am looking at it thinking I did everything right.\n\nI see you say you contacted them but I am going to write out a few things anyway.\n\nFirstly, have you fully read your feedback? They should have made notes throughout and written a feedback properly?\n\nRespectfully, when you asked them for feedback, is what they said really just this one sentence needed changing and that would somehow give you an extra 40% worth of marks? Or, are you not really reading their responses properly and taking it on board?\n\nI only ask because, I reached out to our unit chair and she was extremely helpful, she really did detail for me where I was losing marks. That despite, covering 'everything', and doing the referencing right, and having good writing, it was missing key things, and it wasn't a good enough, or the right, structure for the level we are expecting.\n\nBut, if you really feel your work IS good, that you really did answer the questions properly, and their only feedback literally was \"if you wrote this one sentence, I'd have given you an extra 40%\".  Then I personally would try one more time to ask them and say \"I don't understand that sorry, could you provide more elaborate feedback, I barely passed this assessment, that indicates I am missing a lot and would appreciate more detailed feedback in order to improve\". (keeping it focused on, your work, and how to improve for the future vs sounding like you disagree with their marking - if that was the case and you truly believe it's worth more, you go straight to the UC with that one). And yes, perhaps as someone else suggested, reach out above their head after that because, to me, at least you've given them one more chance, to be helpful and you have made it CLEAR, their feedback wasn't helpful. \n\nI got that ALL through high school and it pissed me off, only ever getting 11/20 and the teacher saying \"it was good work just, could be a bit better\" never telling me what better was, getting to my undergrad and doing WELL and now my postgrad realising \"I can say something and ask for help\".\n\nIf they are not marking fairly nor providing appropriate feedback on how to improve, the university isn't giving you what you are paying them for at this point, students shouldn't be nervous to say that. You aren't asking for a change in grade, you're asking for how to change the next grade yourself!",

What i mean by \"this or that sentence\" is just an example from a previous unit - she literally said for one bit \"you had to mention from this specific recommended article that gamblers are more likely to (insert the sentence here) for a mark.\" for that assignment, it turned out that the articles they said were optional were in fact very much not optional and here i was losing marks by doing all my own research haha.. I had another tutor just be like \"aww chin up! Here is one extra mark!\" and then i sometimes just don't get a response at all. Each assignment is different obviously so i find that the info they give isn't quite applicable for the next assignments, which is why I'm just feeling like I'm missing something in terms of knowing what they're actually going to be marking me on. When you say that you were missing key things, that's what i feel like im doing, but with no way to know what these key things are.. Hope that makes sense",

That's honestly complaint worthy to me. \n\nAnd it's also why feedback needs to be, somewhat specific to explain why your marks are what they are for this assessment but also needs to be broad enough that you can apply it to others. \n\nBut also, I've never needed to use one specific reference and quote one exact line in an assessment before? Unless the assessment was about that specific reading it seems a bit silly? If I can answer your question and use other valid resources, I've done the work. \n\nIf you want to give them one more chance I think it's completely fair to send an email and say basically what you're saying here \"I'd appreciate more feedback thank you, telling me this one sentence was required doesn't seem to explain the loss of 40% and I would like to understand how to improve for the next assessment\".  Or something. Being assertive and advocating for yourself is completely fair. You're paying for this product after all. \n\nThe ones who haven't responded at all I'd go to the unit chairs and ask them for feedback and explain you were never responded to and want to improve.",

    "postText": "I'm doing a Psych double major at UWA and am supposed to graduate mid 2022.\n\nThe uni has just shuffled the structure of the degree so that now basically I need to pick a 3rd year unit from an external uni if I still want to graduate at the same time. I want to go to Curtin, but I'm looking at the handbook and I'm struggling to get enough info from the syllabus to see if I've done similar units at UWA. Some of the descriptions only have one sentence.\n\nI'm mostly looking at doing any one of these: PSYC3005, PSYC3000, PSYC3002 and PSYC3001. Could anyone describe the units for me?",

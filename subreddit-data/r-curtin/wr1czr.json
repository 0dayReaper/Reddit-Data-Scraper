            "comment": "From my understanding, when you choose your course you are also choosing your major/minor. Now, where there is some leeway is until you start doing units that are specific to that major/minor. For example, some first-year units are general units that everyone in the Bcom course will do. There is from my understanding also a fair amount of freedom to change majors and minors - the only catch being it may take you longer to finish your degree, especially if you change later in the degree. \n\nI'm not the sure about the Bcom BBA thing but a Bachelor of Business Administration is not a Bachelor of Commerce. \n\nThe difficulty of a course is somewhat dependent on how hard you study and how much you like the course. If you achieved the entrance standard for the course you are capable of finishing the degree. That being said the course will be more difficult if you do not enjoy it. My personal advice after switching from Law/Commerce double degree to an Education degree is to follow your passion, the university makes it easy to switch if you find it is not what you are looking for. \n\nGood luck with your degree, enjoy your time at Curtin!",

            "comment": "BBA is less comprehensive - you do a number of 4 unit minors (either 3 or 4) rather than 8 unit majors. Bachelor of commerce you do 1 or 2 8 unit majors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBBA is considered an attractive degree in some countries (India is one), however Bachelor of Commerce is  a much more well recognised degree around the world. None of the BBA minors are accredited with any industry body whereas a lot of the B-Comm majors are (such as Accounting, Finance and Financial Planning, Property valuation etc). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinance is probably the toughest Commerce major but still isnt that hard. with minimal effort most people can pass, it is very hard to fail at curtin unless you don't hand in assessments.",

It was always said that Notre Dame was the best for nursing as you get a lot more prac hours, then curtin was second. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing about ECU is that its in joondalup which, while right by the train line, is pretty far away from everything. Curtin is a bit more central",

I left cause it wasn't for me, I didn't think there were any issues with the course. Teaching is good and the classrooms are decent. \n\nIt was largely domestic students, I didn't really have much to do with any international students. Everyone was really nice though\n\nYou'll also need to be prepared to not be able to work as well. During your pracs youre basically working full time hours so you don't have time to do an actual paying job",

And five star teaching for almost two decades which is unheard of. And the largest program in the state. \n\n\u201cBetter\u201d is relative. Better on what?\n\nIf \u201cbetter\u201d means you want a small program or catholic experience or want to live in freo ND is for you. But if \u201cbetter\u201d means the best teaching as determined by students who rate their own program highly then \u201cbetter\u201d means ECU in almost every discipline. \n\nLook it up, it\u2019s the only ranking that matters to me ;(what students think about their teaching).",

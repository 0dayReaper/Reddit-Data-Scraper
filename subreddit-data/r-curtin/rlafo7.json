With the EFY you have the whole year to decide what stream (electrical, mechanical, civil etc) you want to go down and if you want to do a double degree (BEng (Hons)/BSc, BEng (Hons)/BCom). You only have to have the decision made going into second year, even then it's not the end of the world to change stream/course within eng, so don't stress! Hmu if you have any questions about eng at Curtin \ud83d\ude04.",

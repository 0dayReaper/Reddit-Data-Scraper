    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a currently a nursing student at Curtin but I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019d prefer to do Speech Pathology instead.\n\nI\u2019m interested in applying for ECU or Curtin, however, if I were to receive an offer from both universities, which one provides the better learning experience, practical experience and overall student experience for me to choose?\n\nI\u2019ve contacted ECU regarding the entry requirements and it seems that I may have a good chance at getting in but I\u2019m not sure of which uni to choose.\n\nI live closer to Curtin, but the commute to ECU would only be an extra 10-15 minutes for me, so I honestly don\u2019t mind the distance.\n\nAny experience from either of the 2 unis regarding this course or overall student experience would be much appreciated.",

    "postText": "The units that I'm meant to enroll in for sem 2 year 1 do not correlate with the course structure for Bachelor of Commerce, its showing units that state that they must be completed in sem 2 2023 but those units under the course structure are from year 2 and year 3. Anyone else experiencing this?, the message that reads next to the units are \"this unit is not available in other study periods for the current year\" with the only option being semester 2 2023. If I were to continue on with this, I would have to do 5 units for semester 2 which seems off. I messaged Curtin connect on this and still am waiting on a response.",

            "comment": "Think you might be a bit confused by the wording.\n\nJust because something is not available in another period at the moment. Doesn\u2019t mean you need to do it in sem 2. You would only need to do that if it was also a pre-req for sem 1 units next year.\n\nI\u2019m guessing the system doesn\u2019t have availability for sem 2 2024 yet, so sem 2 only units would be displaying as only available in sem 2 2023 right now.\n\nAlso though, if your stream only has 7 \u2018year 1\u2019 units like my commerce degree did, then it\u2019s normal to do a \u2018year 2\u2019 unit in your first year.\n\nThere is not really any enforced levels or order for units other than specific pre-requisite per unit, but sticking to your major unit structure is generally recommended.",

For sem 2 I must do 1 common unit and 1 unit from my major with the 2 other units being from specialisations I chose it seems. This was from the course structure. Just so confused on the units that list only sem 2 2023.",

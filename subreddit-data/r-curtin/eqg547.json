However I'm having trouble finding a unit which matches it (Business Systems Selections  [http://handbook.curtin.edu.au/units/32/320215.html](http://handbook.curtin.edu.au/units/32/320215.html) )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs side note i'm open to literally any ideas on how I can complete my course by mid this year, I can't take uni life anymore I f\\*\\*\\*ing hate it so much i genuinely don't believe I could do another semester after this. Just this morning I woke up in the middle of the night with a nightmare of having to wait till semester 2 to finish off lol\n\nI know my unit is available online only so would it may even be possible just to do it sem 1 just all online?\n\nI've already looked through [Open.edu.au](https://Open.edu.au) with no luck, any advice?",

They can advise if other Curtin students have taken a similar unit (just to double check), otherwise ask for a copy of the unit outline (if they will supply it) and then contact admission offices at other universities so they can compare units.",

When you find something possible, make sure it is the same level or a bit higher. Then click through and compare the content. The Learning Outcomes (LOs) should be equivalent to 75%. Then complete the Cross Institutional Enrollment form at Curtin to get approval showing equivalency in the units you have found.",

I fought for weeks to be able to walk. The only reason they allowed it is because I had asked, and got in writing, that my marks would be back in time. My invite to graduate literally came out at 4pm on the last day possible.",

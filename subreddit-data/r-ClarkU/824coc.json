    "postText": "Super excited to see Clark subreddit! \n\nI\u2019m a prospective grad student with a couple of questions. Some may be bit broad question but please answer however you\u2019d like. It\u2019s more of a conversation starter so if you have anything you think it\u2019d be helpful for someone new, that\u2019d be cool. \n\n1. What\u2019s the relationship like between grad students and undergrads? Is there a big distance? How are grad students perceived by undergrads? \n\n2. How is Clark perceived by outsiders in terms of academic reputation? What\u2019re some known departments? \n\n3. Local protein heavy and cheap, reasonably healthy hole in the walls please!\n\n4. Clark Gym! When I visited I didn\u2019t see a deadlift platform while I did see squat racks. How do people deadlift -.- or do people just not deadlift here... \n\n5. What\u2019re some cool cafes around Clark where you can meet students from other schools? Is there any ways to get connected with UMass medical school folks or WPI? \n\n6. Any suggestions on regions for housing? I\u2019m looking for bit newer houses to purchase. \n\nThanks! ",

            "comment": "I've been an undergard and a grad there, so keep in mind that's my perspective. \n\n1. I don't see a giant gap or awkwardness. Just be friendly and it'll go well.\n2. Clark is known pretty well for it's psychology,  political science, environmental studies, and geography. Our MBA program is pretty good, too.\n3. Local protein? I don't know what you mean here. Clark is in a neighborhood with a lot of great Vietnamese food. Worcester has really gotten pretty flush with good food.\n4. There is a weight room in the back on the lower ground of the gym. I didn't deadlift, so I can't speak to that much.\n5. Cafes: Acoustic Java is the Clark one, Nu Cafe is good, Bean Counter is more WPI and Becker, UMass med... I'm not so sure. They're over near the lake, so a bit farther than the others. In House Coffee is the only place I can think of off the top of my head.\n6. Check out Hampton Properties for renting. They do a good job of updating older victorians and the like. I like the Elm Park area a bunch. There are some cool apartment buildings turned from old factories worth checking out all over the city (one right by Clark, actually).",

Annie's is a diner on the corner of campus that is definitely cheap, greasy diner deliciousness. Acoustic Java is \"healthy\" but overpriced. Chick Pea is this little vegan place that's actually super delicious. Havienda don Juan is a must, a lovely little spot of Hispanic food. Red Lantern is good Chinese.\n\nOther places are a bit more of a walk or a few minute drive. Yelp is actually a pretty good resource for the main restaurant runs, like Shrewbury Street. If you like beer, Armsby Abbey is something you have to check off your list. ",

            "comment": "I went to Clark Undergrad but I'm a Worcester native so I think I have some useful insights. :) \n\n1. In my experience there wasn't much overlap, but 3rd/4th years are allowed to take some graduate courses so you might be in the same classes sometimes. I took a phD level geography course as a senior, and tbh it was really hard to tell who was undergrad vs grad! Everyone was on the same level intellectually and friendly towards each other -- no resentment or competition at all. \n\n2. It depends. I'm at UChicago now and there's a lot of people here who have never heard of Clark. But on the other hand, a professor I was speaking to last week said to me that Clark is \"first rate.\" We're known for the psych and geography departments, mostly. The phD in holocaust studies is also world renowned although it's not necessarily the first think you think of when you think \"Clark.\"\n\n3. Da Lat vietnamese on Park Ave is super cheap and the portions are generous. \n\n4. Can't answer this, I never went to the gym lol\n\n5. Nu Cafe on Chandler is a really great spot. Mostly popular with Worcester State and Assumption kids but you get a nice mix of Worcester locals and college kids. \n\n6. The West Side (Tatnuck, Worcester State area) is generally one of the nicest areas although you'll definitely pay more than you will in, say, Main South. ",

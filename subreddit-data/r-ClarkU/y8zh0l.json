    "postText": "Hi! I'm currently a senior in high school looking at Clark, and was wondering if people on here could give me some honest feedback on stuff. \n\nSo one of the first things drawing me to Clark is their game design program. I know it's the first year of opening since they just recently merged, but is it really actually that good? Are there any downsides?\n\nAlso, as a transgender student looking to transition in college, how is their support with that? I'm also Asian, so does anyone know how big the Asian population is on campus? \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I graduated a while ago, but I will try and answer some of your questions. Clark specifically absorbed the game design program from Becker because it was an excellent program, so I assume it is really good, though Clark is more known for its liberal arts majors. \n\nClark is an extremely inclusive university, in the most liberal state in the country, I don't think you would have any issues on campus. While I am not personally LGBTQ, there is a big presence on campus and the university as a whole is extremely diverse. Many of my friends from college are LGBTQ. \n\nLike I said above, the student population is extremely diverse, there are many APAC students. Additionally, the campus is very near a lot of Asian grocery stores and the area of Worcester it is in has a heavy Cambodian/Vietnamese population. \n\nOne side note, is that the campus is not in the best area of Worcester. Personally, I never felt unsafe on campus, but it is what it is. On the plus side, of you want to live off campus rent is extremely cheap.\n\nOverall, Clark is an amazing tight knit school. I graduated almost 10 years ago and I am still extremely close with my Clark friends, in fact, I might my spouse on during the first month of my freshman year. I look back extremely fondly on my years in Worcester, and would recommend the school to anyone thinking about it.",

For example, instead of a math requirement, it\u2019s a formal analysis requirement, so classes like computer science or GIS can fulfill it (my high school forced me to take calculus for college, I did not need it for Clark in my major).  Also, it\u2019s super easy to change or add majors/minors at Clark, and you don\u2019t have to decide until the end of your sophomore year.  Even then, you can still add stuff after the fact (I am a junior and still figuring out if I want to do a second major). \nAlso, at Clark (at least in my social circles), I know more LGBTQ+ people than not, so no worries there. Professors typically good about pronouns and name changes.",

Its literally not our program it's beckers. but seemingly it is pretty good from the people i know in it.\n\nYou won't have many better picks for LGBT acceptance. Clarks a pretty progressive school. Like super progressive this campus is very very gay. and those who arent LGBT are almost all totally fine with trans ppl. You should fit right in, it may very well be a perfect fit.\n\nIm not sure abt asian population. it should be stats available online. If i had to guess tho it seems decently sizeable, I think? That being said a lot of that is international students from China or India so as far as Asian Americans go idk. \n\nThats the best info i can give you from my 2 years here. Good luck on finding a good college!",

Some systems of support are Prism (LGBTQ Club), ISEA (Identity, Student Engagement and Access), and Affinity Groups that ISEA organizes by identity.

The faculty and the facilities were all very impressive and it is clear that the dept/major is gaining a lot of notoriety since it was merged into Clark. Since Clark is a liberal arts school the department has experience a big increase in interest/enrollment into the Game Dev classes.\n\nThe new building is about complete and is ahead of schedule for opening as the move must happen as the lease at old location ends in Aug so they will be in the new fancy building starting in the Fall! https://www.clarku.edu/next/media-arts-computing-design/\n\nWe are Asian and based on CDS info Clark is about 7% Asian which is I think expected for such a small institution that is in a smaller city. We are also looking at Drexel and they are 22% in an urban location. During our visit we ate at a local Vietnamese restaurant a block from the campus center and a Sushi place in town and we give thumbs up on their authenticity!\n\nI can't speak to LGBTQ on campus, but others have provided their input. I can say that we come from a very liberal area and my son has LGBTQ friends and is very accepting. I don't think you have much to be concerned with. Note, they even hosted a conference about Diversity &amp; Inclusion in eSports! https://clarknow.clarku.edu/2023/03/13/conference-to-look-at-issues-of-diversity-inclusion-around-esports/",

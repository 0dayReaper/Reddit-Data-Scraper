    "postText": "Hi, I am a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine who is conducting a research study that investigates language learning in bilinguals who are immersed in their nondominant language.\u00a0**I am specifically recruiting Chinese international students who are currently studying abroad in the US.**\u00a0The study is conducted online and involves completing tasks on the computer during a zoom\u00a0meeting.\u00a0 The computer tasks involve speaking in English, Mandarin, completing a survey about language experience, and also learning Spanish words and grammar.\u00a0The experiment involves 2 experimental sessions. The first lasts 1 hour and the second approximately 35 minutes. Participants will be paid $15 per hour for a total of $25.\u00a0If you are interested in learning more about the study or signing up, go to this link:\u00a0[https://www.facebook.com/ucibmb/photos/a.128932202747611/128932049414293](https://www.facebook.com/ucibmb/photos/a.128932202747611/128932049414293)",

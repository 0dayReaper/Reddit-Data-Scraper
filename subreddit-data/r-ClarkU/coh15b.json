    "postText": "I am currently a high school junior interested in attending Clark and I think it would be a great thing if I could get a biography of sorts describing Clark and its many unique traits.\n\nSome things that I thought of listing about Clark are its unique strengths, unique flaws, its average student (what kind of person they are), your most memorable experience, things you didn\u2019t expect, people you would recommend Clark to, how big the average class is, the quality of the professors, and if you felt Clark has made a big impact on your life.\n\nAll of these are just ideas, and if anyone has any other traits about Clark they would like to share, then please do! \n\nI\u2019m hoping this post will not only help me make a decision about Clark, but also help future high school students who happen to stumble along this thread and be able to get a feel about the university.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I think the unique strength of Clark is that it's small, so that a single student can make a bigger impact and is more likely to get meaningful communication with faculty and the administration. It's very easy to be a big fish in a small pond there.\n\nFlaw wise, I think the administration can fumble a lot of things, but these don't affect the average student too badly unless they're heavily involved in university affairs.\n\nThe average Clarkie is fairly liberal and moderately sociable. Most are nice to converse with and many are generous and helpful. There have been times where people have agreed to buy me a coffee when i've forgotten my wallet and offered them Venmo for it.\n\nMy most memorable experience is joining the Quidditch team. I've made lifelong friends and companions and now I run my own community team in Worcester.\n\nThings I didn't expect? I never expected to become a history major, but I don't regret it. Your perspective shifts a lot when you get a broad range of faculty from all walks of life teaching you.\n\nI would recommend Clark to anyone who wants to feel like they're making an impact. Main South has a lot of opportunity for volunteer and humanitarian work, and you can make a name for yourself here, at least on a resume.\n\nThe average class (except for intro classes) is fairly medium/small. You won't see massive halls filled with hundreds here.  The last couple seminars I've been in have had less than 10 people most of the time, and other more traditional lectures can have anywhere between 20 and 50 students. Professors are often helpful or at least easy to contact and get to know.\n\nThe professors vary just like every university. Some are phenomenal and unforgettable, others are average, and some are questionable.\n\nClark has definitely impacted my life greatly and I feel like an improved and more educated person after graduating.",

            "comment": "Strengths: small class size, faculty-student one-on-one experience, flexibility with studies and majors, small campus, a billion activities, \"something for everyone\", dining hall food is excellent and good for allergies/diets, some first-year residence halls have private bathrooms (which is a god send).\n\nFlaws: some housing is a little dated (but that's also part of the charm), course timing can get tight at small schools (so many people trying to get into one class that's offered once per year but you're also studying abroad, etc.), occasional administrative hiccups (but isn't that anywhere?), mail room lines can be long depending on the day, there's a lot of construction in Worcester and around campus (tough for commuters). I guess none of these are unique to Clark? Haha probably all #smallschoolproblems.\n\nAverage student: Clarkies can be described as opinionated, active/engaged, studious, and accepting. Of course, there are all kinds of people there. But that's the thing - you can be accepted for whoever you are. At least that's what I found. But I'm not a POC or gender queer so I can't speak to experiencing those identities on campus.\n\nMost memorable experience: being in Gala. Please look up Clark's international gala. It's a huge event and a big point of pride on campus. It's everything that's good with Clark bundled into an incredible event. Please get involved!\n\nThings I didn't expect: having limited options for studying abroad (there are certain approved programs which can limit studies and location), incredible dining food (so many vegan options. and they hand soak all the beans! so impressive. seriously, look into their dining options. I toured the kitchen and hardly anything is frozen or canned. It's amazing), sustainability focus (compost, battery recycling, zero waste events), being friends with athletes, some pretty big and organized parties (djs in the basement, real bar setups), falling in love with Worcester, no air conditioning in dorms.\n\nProfessors: I liked most of my professors and loved many. There were a few that I really hated, and they were tenured and teaching those random required courses you need to take for liberal arts (astronomy, philosophy, math, etc). But I also hated the subjects so I might be biased? For courses that I wanted to take (and the required English I took), education was top notch, challenged me, and allowed me to push back a bit to learn what I wanted to learn (I would often push back on busy work kind of assignments if I felt it wasn't of value to me). I studied international development, to give you an idea of which professors I'm talking about. That major has EXCELLENT faculty.\n\nImpact: Words cannot describe the impact Clark has had on my life. Sure my experience had some flaws, but it was the best place for me. I was able to be myself there, discover what I needed to during that time in my life, explore, try/fail/succeed, grow up, learn life skills, make forever friends, and connect with incredible mentors. I think you'll find that Clark's faculty-student relationship is one of the best things about the school. Those relationships will impact you in ways that no single course ever could.",

            "comment": "Unique strengths: This can be good or bad but it\u2019s pretty easy to meet other people on campus. You get to know a lot of people. So I personally liked that it was a small school. \n\nFlaw: The administration. They claim to be all about challenging convention but don\u2019t like it if clubs or students actually do so. They kinda care more about making money than the students. \n\nStudents: They\u2019re pretty liberal. There\u2019s pockets of people who are conservative or people who are communists. Clarkies generally don\u2019t mind helping others. \n\nMemorable experiences: I started a club called Umbrellas as a sophomore that merged with OPEN this year after I graduated to become Prism. It was a lot of work to form a club. It took around a semester to form it. Umbrellas was a club for trans, gender nonconforming and nonbinary students. I was the President of OPEN and Umbrellas my senior year but had been on e board since I was a sophomore for both. \n\nAnother memorable experience was bad. The administration moved OPEN now Prism which is the GSA at clark from the main part of campus to off campus. They moved in administrative people into what were the student offices. They also moved Choices which is a sex education club where students can buy sex toys, condoms, etc from. However they didn\u2019t move a club that was actually discriminating against queer students from the main part of campus. So that\u2019s mostly why I don\u2019t think the administration really cares about the students and what they want that much. I would also categorize as something I didn\u2019t expect. \n\nPeople I would recommend clark to: If you\u2019re mostly a left leaning person who believes in social justice. \n\nAverage class size: It depends. The biggest class I was in was Bio 101 which had 200+ students. However that\u2019s extremely rare. The intro classes generally were around 25-50 people. The higher level classes had 5-15 people. \n\nQuality of professors: There were good and bad ones. Some of the professors I got along with really well and were good at their job. Others who were just doing it because they\u2019re required to teach. So it was a mix. \n\nChanged my life: I don\u2019t think it did. I made close friends but other than that not really. \n\nBtw I was a psychology major. I minored in history and political science.",

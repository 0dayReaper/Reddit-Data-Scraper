I would honestly come prepared with questions more than anything. Think about some of the paths that you want to take at Clark (majors, minors, concentrations, sports, other activities) and ask them about it. Even if they don't know the answer, they can probably connect you with someone who does. At the end of the day, it is your college experience so make sure you come away with a clear picture of what potentially going to Clark would look like. Obviously there is expectation versus reality, but whatever helps you the better. \n\nClarkies are always and have always been very friendly to people who are taking tours or are potentially going to join our community.",

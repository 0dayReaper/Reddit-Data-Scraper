As a volleyball player, she\u2019s wondering how competitive the club teams are, specifically in volleyball, if possible. Do they travel? How many hours a week does participation require? Are they student-run? Thanks for any help.",

            "comment": "I played club volleyball for a little. Yes, it is student run. If I remember correctly, the practices were 1-2 hours at night, twice a week. Practices are co-ed. We did travel, but only to other schools/tournaments in New England. Only day trips, no overnights.\n\nMy problem was that it wasn't competitive enough. The guys team got crushed at the tournament I went to and I didn't really have fun. Not sure how competitive the girls were. Practices were fun and the people are really nice--it's just not big/sporty enough to field a really good club team IMO, but that could change depending on the year.",

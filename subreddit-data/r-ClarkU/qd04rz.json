    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a first-year student who's halfway through their first semester at Clark. As advising for spring has started, I wanted to ask any of the Data science majors what the intro courses were like- was it particularly challenging, and was a lot of coding (Python-related) involved?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are the courses I've taken this fall:\n\nEcon 010- I'm planning to major in Economics, and it also fulfills a requirement under the economics track for Data Science.\n\nCSCI 120- Fulfills a prerequisite for Data Science.\n\nMath 124/Honors Calculus I: Fulfills a prerequisite for Data Science \n\nEng 020: Just to fulfill the VE requirement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCourses I'm planning to take in spring:\n\nEcon 160\n\nMath 125/Honors Calculus II \n\nIntro to Data Science\n\nAnd another course to fulfill either the Historical Perspective or Values Perspective requirement\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

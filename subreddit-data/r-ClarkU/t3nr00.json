            "comment": "I sat for an interview a few days ago and the questions they asked me are the usual questions you'd expect to come up in a college interview. I'm not sure if they'll ask you the same things but some of the questions I answered were about how I came to learn about Clark, what my ECs/hobbies are and any achievements I've made in them, how my friends would describe me and the person who's been the most influential to me and the ways in which they have impacted my life.\n\nAlso, in addition to the interviewer asking you questions, you'll have the opportunity to ask them questions of your own and I recommend you use this to your advantage. If there's something you'd like to know about the Clark experience that you may have not come across on the website and in the brochures, you have this opportunity to find out.\n\nOne last thing, a piece of advice really: relax and pretend it's a conversation with an acquaintance or a friend. I was lowkey tense during my interview and wish someone had told me this.\n\nGood luck!",

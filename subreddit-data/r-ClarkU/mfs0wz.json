The program will continue to operate out of Becker\u2019s campus for the next year or so, but from what I\u2019ve heard from my contacts Clark is planning on expanding their campus to accommodate the new school in the future. Sad to see Becker go, but I\u2019m glad the program is getting pick up. It\u2019s something really special",

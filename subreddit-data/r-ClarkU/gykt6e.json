    "postText": "Do u guys recommend applying for university housing or I should look for off-campus housing? I was accepted to the Environmental Science &amp; Policy master program, so I am considering IDCE housing right now. I am also interested in renting landlord's properties.  prefer living somewhere around the campus, since I don't have a car. Any insights would be appreciated!",

And then getting kicked out the day after finals. No option for air conditioning. I could go on.",

I can invite you to some relevant Clark housing groups on Facebook if you want. \n\nMy reddit is pseudo-public though so if yours isn\u2019t then maybe I can find links to them instead (I\u2019m not sure if fb groups let you link them but I can check).",

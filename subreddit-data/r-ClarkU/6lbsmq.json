I will raise my GPA to hopefully a 3.6 and idk if I should retake my SAT. What do you guys think my chances are? I also would be transferring into a Computer Science major!",

One of my peers who graduated with me is currently a PhD candidate in CS at UC-Berkeley. I think any CS program is challenging and Clark\u2019s program will not be a walk in the park. ",

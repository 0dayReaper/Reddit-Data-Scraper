My good friends were mostly in Wright, so I walked the 5 minutes to get there. It\u2019s not a huge big deal but I say go as gender-mixed as possible.",

            "comment": "Housing is probably already assigned for the fall, but wanted to add that, aside from gender mix, there's a different feel between the all freshman dorms (Wright and Bullock) and the mixed class dorms (everything else).\n\nFreshman dorms are nice for their energy and the fact that everyone is in the same \"new to college\" boat. There's a strong sense of \"us-ness\" identity associated with the freshman dorms.\n\nMixed class dorms are nice for the opposite reasons. It can be more clique-y because groups of friends have signed up to room together in suites or tried to get close rooms on a hall, but there's also an element of diversity because not everyone is a freshman.",

The bathrooms are also gendered in Bullock and Wright, while the ones in Dana and Hughes are co-ed.\n\nYou have to understand that Bullock and Wright are designed to get first-years to meet new people and make friends. I lived in the older first-year dorms and feel like I could have been a lot better off socially and with more friends if i lived in Bullock or Wright.",

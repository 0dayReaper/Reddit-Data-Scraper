When you meet people, ask them questions about themselves - easy going, general things like \"Are you in any classes you're loving?\", \"Has your hall had any cool activities? We had a cards against humanity tournament the other night.\", \"Have you all figured out how the meal swaps work and where?  It's confusing.\"\n\nIf you hit it off with someone trade socials or numbers.",

Talk to people in your classes if you\u2019re able to. A lot of the friends I made were just people next to me and we\u2019d talk about the homework or something the Professor did. The Professors at Clark are pretty wacky (in a good way mostly!) so there\u2019s always something to talk about. Also, talking about how you\u2019re struggling with homework is good, pretty much everyone is lol\n\n2. People have already said it, but Clark engage!! I\u2019ve heard great stuff about a lot of the clubs\n\n3. Best conversation starters: questions and compliments! You put people in a good mood when you compliment them, which make them more likely to want to keep talking to you. The same goes for if you ask them about themselves, or if you ask them a clarification question. People love talking about themselves and helping others out (trust me, I\u2019m a psych major \ud83d\ude09)\n\n4. On campus resources are a great way to ask how to get engaged on campus. The head of the wellness department helped me a lot last year, and she\u2019s super nice too! She\u2019s currently on maternity leave, but I\u2019m sure her replacement is great too. Academic advising is great too\n\n5. Ok this might sound weird, but try to befriend the most flamboyantly dressed people. Most of them are used to feeling like the \u201cweird person\u201d in a group, so they\u2019re usually extremely nice!\n\nI know that this is a lot and maybe not entirely what you asked for, but I\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity to use all of my accumulated wisdom \ud83d\ude05 Also if this makes you feel better, almost everyone at Clark is extremely nice!! Even the stuff bored people write on the desks in the library are sweet (\u201cgood luck studying!\u201d \u201cYou look great today :)\u201d). If anyone is intentionally mean, they\u2019re the weird ones and probably don\u2019t have a ton of friends because we don\u2019t tolerate that stuff here",

Thanks in advance!\n\nR Drewell: have your or are you going to teach the Bioethics FYI again? Can you or anyone else on the panel speak to any changes that are taking place with the introduction of more public health curricula and/or the new concentration in Science, Technology, and Society (or something to that effect) and how the bio department fits in to this?\n \n\nAll: Do any of you have plans for other creative or inventive First Year Intensives related to Biology?\n\n \nD. Robertson, K Mathis, T Day: how did you become inspired to pursue a STEM career? how has your experience as a woman in STEM been? What are your hopes and plans for inspiring and educating future generations of women in STEM?\n \n\nD Hibbett: At the tail end of a lecture you gave in Bio 102, you notified the class of a presentation in Traina that was being put on by someone in the fine arts. The content of the artist's paintings centered around biological subjects, mainly plants. I was one of the 15 or so students who made the trek through the snow that day, and I was the only one from the biology department (one of the speakers actually took a poll of where we were from). Besides wanting to thank you for inspiring that experience, I wanted to open up the question to you and the rest of the group to talk about their favorite interdisciplinary aspects of biology at Clark, or any other fun things that Clark has to offer that relates to the Bio department.\n\n\nAll: I imagine that most first years don't have a really good idea of what they really want to do in biology, even if they know they are interested, generally. How would you go about explaining your research to a new student, and how might one go about differentiating them as they pertain to different areas of interests and/or strengths in various subjects (beyond and within bio)?",

To answer some of these questions:\n\nProf. Mathis was recently interviewed about her inspiration for becoming a scientist.\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2SshAvN\n\nBeing a woman in science certainly comes with a particular set of challenges. Based on our experiences, the Clark Biology department is a supportive environment for faculty and we hope to provide an inclusive environment for students as well. Currently, the Clark Biology department has a majority of female undergraduate student majors and the faculty is evenly split in gender. In addition, we have an active Women in STEM student-led group that provides networking and support.\n\nWe believe that it is incredibly important for aspiring female scientists to have mentors that have similar-lived experiences. We also actively work to build inclusive environments in our labs and classrooms.\n\nProfs Mathis, Robertson, and Day",

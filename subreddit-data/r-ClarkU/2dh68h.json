            "comment": "&gt;What has your experience at Clark been like?\n\nClark is what you make it.\n\nFor one, I should preface by saying I was a transfer student (went to UVM for a year, graduated Clark). Clark beat the shit out of UVM in every possible way. But that still doesn't tell you what Clark was like. \n\nClark is large enough where you can always meet new people but small enough where a majority of the student body will know who you are if you want them to. Clark, I believe, has some really fantastic professors. They also have some really terrible ones. But that's for every school; and some people think who I think are the worst are some of the best.\n\nClark is about becoming exactly who you want to be. Fuck every other school who tells you you can do that - Clark commits to it. You get the internships if you fight for them. You can be a LEEP Scholar your junior year and get a great internship. You can join research labs as first years. If you want it, take it. If you don't, let it pass.\n\nI have a shitty case where everything went perfect for me - I had an amazing advisor with an open wallet and thousands of connections that got me where I wanted how I wanted and when I wanted. I hate telling it because for my degree currently (Psychology, 19% of the student body) -- I was the only one.\n\nBut I played the system anyway. I got money to travel to Luxembourg through Clark twice! I've been sponsored by Clark an easy $6000. My professor has also given me what now probably equals about $6000 as well.\n\n&gt;Geo majors\n\nNot a geography major, but our Ph.D. program is one of the top 5 in the country. Supposedly it's fantastic. I knew a guy who did it, smarter than me for sure. They have only 4% of the student body (???) and had 15 Honors projects. The psychology department had 19% and had 5 Honors projects. So Geography  is good about getting their students active in work.\n\n&gt;LEEP\n\nSo, three ways you could mean this. LEEP as in the LEEP Scholars, $2500 internship, LEEP as in LEEP Scholarship, full ride x4 years, or LEEP as in the ideal behind Clark. I can't answer #2. \n\nLEEP Scholars -- it's not hard to answer this. You go up to an internship, say \"Hey, I want to work for you for free. I'm getting paid by my school. It's cool.\" And you're kinda just... in. It's pretty easy to get into but it just started, not sure if requirements will be set anytime soon. You can also go Clark-Internship route and get connected with Alumni; that's even better imo.\n\nLEEP as an ideal -- Honestly, it's annoying. Some classes have these guest lectures once a semester where another professor comes in to lecture and it's a different discipline and you're supposed to go \"Oh wow, cool!\" but really it's more \"Free class, cool!\". Before LEEP we were getting hands on experience. Saying LEEP doesn't change the activity we do in the classroom; in my opinion, it belittles it.\n\n&gt;Campus / surrounding area\n\nIt's fine. Negative stuff about Worcester is from the 70s. It's really grown. Sure, some places aren't your preppy middle upper class neighborhoods, but that's not what we're going for. If you want to change the community, don't go to a picture perfect school. Clark does a lot of community service and we have a great relationship with the community. I get the best haircuts I've ever got from a local barbershop next to Clark. They appreciate us and we appreciate them. Sometimes we annoy them (we bought out a street the neighbors liked to speed on) so we gave them a playground in return. There's a Boys&amp;Girls Club and a YMCA you can get involved in; and a lot of bicyclists so there's a bike shop that takes Clark volunteers for a free bike.\n\n\n\nI know it sounds half negative, but I really did love Clark. You would enjoy every minute of it. But Clark is only for a certain kind of person. We aren't Holy Cross - we're not preppy and fratty (no frats/sororities). We're not WPI - not nerdy and building robots to build robots in our spare time. We're Clarkies. We're Clarkward (awkward) and different and hippy a bit (but not like those hippies up at UVM).",

            "comment": "Hey, so I graduated last semester with a undergrad degree in Geography so I'll do my best to answer any questions you have, specifically about the area around clark.\n\nOverall my experience at Clark was positive. I made some great friends and learned a lot. There are a whole host of great programs and crazy professors--especially in the Geography department.\n\nI don't really know much about the GEOG dept of other schools, but I know that Clark is known for its Geography dept. \n\nProfessor Aoyama, Professor Martin, and Professor McCarthy are probably the three I have the most experience with. Professor Aoyama mostly teaches economic geography and I loved her \"Miracle of Asia\" class on how Japan's post-war economic development set the stage for developing countries across the world. \n\nProfessor Martin focuses on urban geography--which is a fascinating subject. I don't think she teaches her \"Discover Worcester\" class anymore (urban geography of Worcester, super interesting), but basically any of her classes are great.\n\nProfessor McCarthy teaches classes on environmental and ecological geography--specifically on water politics. The way we think of the relationship between ourselves and our environment class is facinating--so I would try his class called \"Culture, Place, and the Environment\".\n\nAs for LEEP, well, to be honest I worked most of college, so I wasn't involved in LEEP--really, I don't think I entirely understand it. More information is on the website, but you'll have to ask someone else for a personal account of the program.\n\nAnd now for campus and the surrounding area. Honestly the area isn't great, but it's also not the worst in the world. I remember when I was looking at colleges, I noticed that most colleges had sketchy outer crusts. There are a bunch of reasons for this--but you'll have to take one of Professor Martin's classes to learn about them ;) \n\nHowever, as far as safety goes, unless you're living off campus, this is a moot point. I have NEVER heard of someone getting jumped while on campus. This is because UP (University Police) is everywhere on campus. Furthermore, Clark has a Safety Escort Service that will drive you within a certain radius around campus (I worked for them). This radius includes grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, pharmacies, etc. Pretty much anything you'd need.\n\nWorking at Escort, I've seen Worcester during all times of night (we're open until 4am), and honestly I think the reputation for crime is exaggerated--though there are unseemly elements present. As long as you take Escort after dark, it's no big deal.\n\n\nSo yeah. I'd definitely recommend Clark. If you visit, you should have breakfast at Annie's Clark Brunch diner near the bookstore. But get there early, because it's tiny and everybody loves it.",

            "comment": "Oh, I can answer these!\n\n&gt; What has your experience at Clark been like?\n\nIt has been a very good experience. I applied to 10 schools, got into nine, and ended up deciding after a visit that Clark was the only one that I liked. If you have not visited- I very strongly suggest that you go for an overnight stay. That's really what told me which schools I liked and which I did not. The people here are so friendly that I've even been late to class a few times because I've ran into too many friends between my dorm and the classrooms. There are a ton of student groups and as long as you're friendly you'll make a ton of friends during week one and afterwards.\n\n&gt;For any geography majors, how do you like the program? How do you think it compares with other schools?\n\nI actually AM a Geography major! That being said I have only taken a couple of classes so far (I just declared). One was meh, although this class was a 050 level course and taught by a grad student and not a professor, and my research methods class (which was taught by Deborah Martin) was one of the best classes I've ever taken, period. I wish I could comment more on experience, although I don't have much, but I can tell you about the program itself. Clarks Geography program is one of the oldest in the country, and is nationally ranked across the board if you search geography school rankings in the US. There are four different concentrations- I am pairing the human geography concentration with something called \"urban development and social change\", because I am mostly interested in urban development- so you can really do anything you want in this department. Many schools either feature a geography department OR an environmental science department, however clark features both and they are distinctly separate departments. If you are more interested in the physical processes of earth you might be more interested in environmental science.\n\n&gt; What is being in LEEP like?\n\nI'm going to be honest- every small liberal arts school you look into has some permutation of LEEP, some type of \"unique\" comprehensive program that makes it different than the others. They are all lying to you, and frankly almost none of the student body truly knows what LEEP is, to the point where the student newspaper even published an article about how no one understands it. Again, though, this is not a shortcoming of Clark- you will hear similar sentiments across small american liberal arts colleges.\n\n&gt;How do you like campus and the surrounding area? I've heard a lot of negative stuff about Worcester...???\n\nCampus is a bit small, but there are a TON of restaurants that are dirt cheap (and delicious) immediately surrounding it. We have a CD store, a famous comic book store called That's Entertainment, a hookah bar immediately across the street, a few solid bars... it has a lot of nice fixings but it's a really nice perk to have friends with cars, as the public transportation is inadequate to get around on friday and saturday nights if you're looking to go out on the town. some of the parts around campus are less than safe but as long as you're smart you'll be okay- if you're going down dark side streets (which should generally be avoided no matter where you are) go with a group of friends and you should be fine.\n\nI really love this school. Like I said, I got into nine schools and this (as my safety school) was the only one that I really loved. If you'd like me to elaborate on anything else, get you into contact with someone in the geography department, or ask any other questions feel free to PM me! I love to sell my school to people. :) \n\nEdit: how do I format lol",

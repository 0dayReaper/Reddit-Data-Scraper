    "postText": "Hello! I was accepted to both Clark University and Dickinson with merit aid that makes the bottom line comparable. I like both campuses. Course offerings seem similar. I like that Clark has the experiential component to some classes and the free MBA if I can keep a B+ average. Dickinson seems fine. I'll do fine academically at either place - my real concern is the social aspect. I am pretty anti-Greek (there's a little Greek, 25% on Dickinson, none at Clark) because I don't want my social options driven by jocks or frat boys. But I am a nerdy, \"quirky\", D&amp;D playing, Dr. Marten wearing, unapologetically LGBTQ person. My dad likes Dickinson, but I feel like they're kinda too preppy for me? Not that being preppy means they don't support the LGBTQ community, or tolerate nerds ... but I want to find more of \"my\" type of people at school. Am I wrong in thinking that Clark University may be a little bit of a better fit there? Anyone have any anecdotal evidence to support or refute my broad stroke statement? Thank you in advance for any insight!",

            "comment": "So this may not be helpful as (a) I don't know anything about Dickson and (b) I graduated from Clark a while ago. But what you describe you're looking for feels spot on for Clark. Definitely no frats; there are athletes with a presence on campus, but I don't remember them driving the overall social life. And some of them could be fairly nerdy from what I remember. \n\nSee if you can look into the different clubs each campus has. I wouldn't be surprised if Clark had a D&amp;D Club.",

And there are jocks and frat boy types at Clark too. Tbh college social life is what you make it. I would consider the type of city/region you want to spend four years in. Carlisle PA vs Worcester MA\u2014different places, different vibes and opportunities. I like Worcester myself.",

But from what you are looking for, I think its a good fit for you. The lgbt aspect you\u2019ll find it 100%. We don\u2019t have greek life but usually parties and social events are boring af. Athletes usually hang out between themselves. If you are finding a more quirky place, then Clark is for you.",

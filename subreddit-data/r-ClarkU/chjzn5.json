Also, I want to be a teacher and Massachusetts is the best place for education. Other factors were the Jewish and queer communities, the diversity on campus, the educational opportunities, and their willingness to look past what\u2019s on paper and truly see a student.",

If you read something you like, you can almost guarantee you'll get to take a class on it \\[there are also great resources under the 'undergrad' dropdown on that page **or** check out [the recent course offerings at the bottom of this page](http://catalog.clarku.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=25&amp;poid=4692&amp;hl=History&amp;returnto=search)\\]. Also having an MA/PhD program is a plus if you want to think about an advanced degree in history after undergrad.\n\nThe other miscellaneous things I know is that we have some really cool Archives related programs including a Holocaust and Genocide studies program. If you have any specific questions I can talk to my friend who went to Clark and is now going to a grad program in Military History.",

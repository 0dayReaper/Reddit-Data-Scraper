    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming first year, I ride my bike around pretty often and it\u2019s my primary mode of transportation at home in Brooklyn. I was wondering what the accommodations for bikes are like at Clark, such as indoor places to put them in dorms, and what biking around Worcester is like in general.",

There was a bike rental program and a non-profit affiliated with the school that refurbished old bikes for low income and homeless members of the community biking Worcester isn\u2019t bad but there are very few bike lanes and the streets are narrow. Enjoy your experience it\u2019s an awesome place for an education.",

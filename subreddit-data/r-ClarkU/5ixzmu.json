    "postText": "I have always liked Clark quite a bit. I don't even mind being in Worcester - I live close enough to bring a car, and it's close to some cities with great music scenes (Lowell, Boston). The people sound like truly great people who I could learn a lot from. Here are my questions. \n\n-How many bands are on campus? Does Worcester have a music scene? I sort of need to be in a punk band, or at least a heavy band, in order to retain my sanity. \n-Is the alumni network okay? What about internships? Obviously Worcester doesn't have much to offer in terms of internships.\n-Are the science/stem majors good at Clark? I have heard mixed things. Fifth year sound pretty good though, though I also have heard mixed things about that. \n\nOverall, I definitely think I could be very happy at Clark. Any other thoughts on the college would be welcome and appreciated. ",

            "comment": "'07 grad here. I love my time at Clark. I did three internships, one on campus , two in area schools. There is now a program called leap that focuses on internships and experiential learning. My understanding is a science programs are very strong (I was a psych major). I can't speak to the punk scene personally, but knowing Clarkies I'm sure you will find others to play with. I've been happy with the alumni community. \n\nBest of luck in your process. ",

            "comment": "So, I can't speak as much about the Worcester music scene (although some musicians I used to hang out with were very happy there), but I can speak a bit about the science programs. What Clark has going for it, and is pretty unusual, is its huge emphasis on research. A really big percentage of undergrads work in a lab during their four years, and this is something graduate schools and employers LOVE. My close friend, who was a biochemistry major that joined a lab early on as an undergrad,  was published twice before graduating and ended up snagging some really amazing job offers fresh out of school. My suggestion would be to try to volunteer time in a lab as soon as you can, even if you're just doing lab chores. Not only will the experience look great on your resume, but it will give you a better understanding of your work, which can make classes easier, and will give you a leg up on your peers when everyone starts doing lab work for credits.\n\nI will mention, in fairness, that there's something of a caveat when it comes to the Clark science programs. While you'll get a great education, the school doesn't have the largest support system if you're hoping to go to med school after. This, and the fact that Clark as a small school has less name recognition than other places, might be a barrier if you want to get your MD. That being said, I would definitely recommend Clark; it has a lot to offer and Worcester, while not exactly a good looking city, is a blast to live in. ",

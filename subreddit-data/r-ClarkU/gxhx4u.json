I think it's a great opportunity to show other universities what this kind of disciplinary structure could look like. I'm really proud of Clark for making this choice and I respect Clark more for it.",

Events where the cop would get paid $80 an hour to stand around and make sure college kids were not getting too rowdy.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as completely disassociating and everyone criticizing Clark for doing this doesn\u2019t seem to understand that.\n\nClark has no obligation to be hiring WPD details when UP could do the same thing. \n\nSeems to be the cops are just salty they can\u2019t make $80/hr doing nothing.",

The administration has been paying lip service for decades to demands from Black students and students of color to enact more anti-racist policies and take steps to better support and promote Black voices and success on campus. I\u2019ll put up a link in a separate post, and I strongly encourage folx to go read and sign the petition.",

We're a small school and there aren't that many of us out there, but somehow, we seem to be everywhere. Being a \"Clarkie\" is unmistakable and something you come to sense in others, something to have pride in while also using it as a joking insult for friends. \n\n\nClarkies are... confusing sometimes. We're usually over-involved and we have a lot of opinions, but we don't always put our money where our mouth is... unless something is taken away from us. Clark is a pretty accommodating place (no matter what stories you hear that affect 5-10 people, clark staff and faculty go above and beyond overall for students. It's impossible to make everyone happy all of the time.) and it's continuously progressing. You really need to become part of that change to appreciate it's growth so far.\n\nWorcester is awesome. Yeah, we're in main south, but if you don't care about community service and actually making a difference in people's lives, you.probably shouldn't be at Clark. Worcester has great restaurants and a large variety. The bus system has its shortcomings but it is a lot better than a decade ago. The DCU and Hanover theater have cool things and the shopping centers around are convenient and have anything you'd need.\n\nI'm a big fan of Clark and Worcester. They left a big impression on me and I learned a lot. Just keep trying knew things, be honest with yourself and others, don't try to be something you're not, hold yourself accountable for every aspect of your life, reach out to new people every day, go to your professors' office hours even just to chat, and don't worry too much.",

Then it would die out in a week.\n\nGood point - Admissions had an interview with the school paper, in which they announced Clark was no longer need-blind. The students protested this and freaked out on Admissions and the Deans.\n\nWhat the quote, and rule, was, was that Clark is need-blind for about 95% of the students. They're not need blind on borderline reject cases, in which then the student with the money will get the offer. Economically, this is only a good thing for Clark students. We still are fair to the best of the best, and with that small % that gets offers, Clark is probably a high choice, they don't need aid, and Clark can offer more aid and be more generous to the 95%. \n\nThe whole Occupy movement happened here too. Similar, no one could explain what they were doing and how it would actually change anything.",

If you ever have any questions about classes or either of those departments, feel free to pm me! Like the other poster said, we have incredible, moderately priced restaurants next to campus (sooo much better than WPI). Make an effort to go to Annie's Clark brunch with new friends as soon as you can! :) also- I was just talking to my friends, Clark promotes many of it's programs very poorly to prospective students. You've already discovered geography, which I believe is significantly under sold (we are nationally ranked!) So good for you! Additionally, we have SO MANY theater and performance art opportunities that they probably did not tell you about, at least they did not tell me. I'm glad you already have an idea what you want to study, but remember this is the liberal arts, so don't be afraid of either changing or diversifying. I know very few people who have ended with the same program they began in, and although it is good to go into college with a focus in mind do not stress out about it if you decide you want to try something different. I switched majors three times and felt like I took intro to half of the courses here and I only regret perhaps one of them. :P",

            "comment": "As a graduating senior, I'm happy to get this chance to pass on my accumulated Clark knowledge is patronizingly as possible. While I don't remember exactly what they told me during my tour, let me try to give you the few little tidbits of information I've picked up during my time here, on convenient list form:\n\n1. Eat everywhere you can around campus! Seriously, I can not stress this enough, one of the single biggest draws of the main south neighborhood is the abundance of amazing food. Within walking distance of campus you have Falafel, Jamaican, Annie's Clark Brunch, Vietnamese (both full service restaurants and a kick-ass deli), West African, Kenyan, Fro-yo Mexican, Salvadorian, Sushi, Hot Pot, Chinese (The delicious non-Americanized kind), locally made ice cream, and wings. I'm sure I'm forgetting a few too, and there are plenty more (Corner Grille, Addie Lee's, etc) that are less than five minutes away by car. Add to this the fact that everything is shockingly cheap, and you really don't have an excuse *not* to eat out from time to time.\n\n2. Avoid the meal plan as soon as you can. Seriously, you're going to be stuck on it your first year, but drop it the instant doing so becomes an option. The food in the cafeteria is mediocre, despite the hard work of staff, and while the bistro is better, its way too pricy for what it is. There are two Asian groceries near campus (Family 88, and Ha Tien) where you can stock your kitchen for next to nothing, and an even better one, Mekong, about half a mile away, so spending thousands to eat Clark food really just doesn't make sense.\n\n3. Understand that most of the dorms are kind of shitty, particularly Johnson-Sanford. My theory is that the blueprints for the dorms got mixed up with ones for a prison cell block, but regardless how they ended up as such, a few of these buildings are a little soul crushing. Make the best of them while you're there, and try to move into your own apartment as soon as possible, since neighborhood rent tends to be pretty reasonable, especially when you split the costs with others. Add to this the fact that the local thrift stores tend to sell furniture/home goods at really reasonable prices, and it becomes pretty easy to make a rented space feel like home on a tight budget.\n\n4. Expect financial services to fuck up something having to do with your money. Seriously, its basically a Clark right of passage. I don't know why this one department is so damned bad, but just about everyone I know has had a headache with them at one point or another.\n\n5. I have to admit I'm not the most familiar with your major, but if its available, get involved in research as quickly as you can. Clark does a great job getting students involved in ongoing research, and having a year or two working on a project looks absolutely amazing on resume when you're looking for jobs and grad schools.\n\n7. Drink as much local beer as you can get your hands on! I get that there's this weird instinct for freshmen to drink almost exclusively Natty Ice and cheap spiced rum, but for the love of god try the local brew. Worcester itself has Wormtown, which makes a number of killer beers, and Berkshire Brewing, as well as Opa Opa, are both amazing breweries nearby in central MA.\n\n7. Explore the neighborhood, it really has some hidden gems that are worth trying to stumble upon. I know it doesn't exactly look welcoming, but Main South is generally pretty safe, so long as you don't go wandering the back streets alone after dark. While living in a low income community comes as a bit of a shock to some new students, don't let yourself fall into the group that barely leave the confines of campus. Just to get you started, try to find the local pickle factory, located less than a ten minute walk off campus--their fulls sours are well worth wandering.",

That one seemed nice, even though some of them did seem not as nice. \n\n4. I'll keep that in mind\n\n5.

                            "comment": "I don't think eating out every night would be cheaper than the meal plan, but cooking with ingredients from local markets definitely would be. The meal plan options that would provide you with two meals a day will set you back $3500 a year at a minimum, so its super easy to do better than that by making your own food. That having been said, the local restaurants are, by and large, really cheap, and many of them will give you a full dinner for around $10. In particular, Annie's is crazy cheap, to the point where I thought they had undercharged me the first time I went. Just to help you out, I've made a little list of places you can get a cheap meal within the travel range of the Clark Escort vans.\n\nRestaurant|What to Get|Estimated Price\n------------|------|----------------\nAhn Thu Deli|Vietnamese Sandwiches, smoothies and Rice Boxes| $4-7\nDalat|Vietnamese Soups, Spring Rolls| $6-9\nRed Pepper|Any actual Szechuan Food| $8-12\nSafari Cafe|Kenyan Buffet| $11\nAnnie's Clark Brunch|Breakfast Standards| $3-7\nHacienda Don Juan|Papusas|$2-4\nYamon Jamaican|Mac &amp; Cheese, Pretty much Everything| $7-11*\nFantastic Pizza|Falafel, Shawarma, Avoid their Pizza| $5-7\n\n   \n*Just a heads up, Yamon takes forever to cook your food, as its just one guy in the kitchen, but its damn good.\n\n\n2. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by a basement dorm, as I think most of the dorm buildings have rooms in the basement. That being said, Maywood, Wright, bullock, and Blackstone are the four nicer buildings.   \n\n3. Don't take my advise as definitive here, but my guess is that its something of a mixed bag when it comes to fake ids. On the one hand, most of the liquor stores do run license scans, particularly if you're from out of state, so it may well be a good idea to find someone of legal age to buy your booze. Bars and concert venues, on the other hand, are more likely to give you a pass. If you look like a preschooler or are acting like a dick, having a fake probably won't be enough to get you through the door, but if you keep your cool and look like you *might* be 21, I'm guessing you'll be ok.\n\n4. So good news, bad news when it comes to crime against students. The honest truth is that yes, occasionally students are mugged, although these thefts are non-violent more often than not. While there are certainly many cases where the victims just got unlucky, a large portion of these robberies are set into motion because the student does something to make themselves a target, like walking alone on the back streets, or openly carrying expensive electronics. You can never totally avoid the risk of crime, as is the case in just about any major city, but so long as you use your common sense, you'll most likely be fine.",

    "postText": "Hello! I am a rising senior planning on applying to college. As someone who is both queer and Latine, I am a bit concerned about my treatment or role on campus as someone who has a marginalized identity. So I am here to ask what your experiences and treatment have been as queer and students of color at your institution. Please also let me know what resources and spaces are available to you because of your identity, and in the surrounding region. Please be as honest as possible, this is a safe space. You can dm me any time. Thank you so much.",

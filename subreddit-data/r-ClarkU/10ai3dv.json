    "postText": "I\u2019m and international student from England looking to join Clark in the fall semester. I\u2019ve spoken to some students &amp; the consensus is that the university is pretty small. \n\nI was wondering if it\u2019s possible in the US to make friends with other college students &amp; attend some of their events/parties/gigs (I understand MIT and Boston Uni are nearby) - or if it\u2019s more clique-y and closed off. Generally also interested in your opinion of social engagements at clarke",

            "comment": "Just be aware that MIT and Boston Uni are not nearby (an hour commute). WPI and Worcester State would be more realistic that people go to parties or make friends. Clark by itself is quite cliquey though, if you are not great at being out going and finding friends, the first few days will be difficult and people tend to group up pretty easily by orientation. Don\u2019t worry though. You will find your people.",

Because you don\u2019t have any classes or campus in common with them, participating in a club that stretches over multiple universities will do you well. Also, people will download Tindr and use it to match with people from a certain university and then use that connection to work their way in to the social scene.\n\nAlso, Clark is not very cliquey. Some people have that New England \u201ccharm\u201d to them that can make them cold at first appearance, but everyone is willing to talk to you if you are open and engaging.",

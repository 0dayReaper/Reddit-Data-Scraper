The rooms are a good size but there are minimal / old common spaces in the buildings.\n\nBullock and Wright halls are newer and closer to the center of campus (although the whole campus is easily walkable). I graduated several years ago, so this may have changed, but Wright tended to have a reputation as a louder dorm.\n\nIf you're able to get into a mixed-year dorm as a transfer student, Johnson Sanford is nice. The rooms are basically the same as Dana/Hughes but there are new common areas &amp; study rooms.",

Rooms are decent size and they have spaces such as a pool \ud83c\udfb1 area. I would probably recommend those. Wright is known for having tons of athletes and is probably the loudest.\n\nHughes and Dana are ok too. Dana has some issues tho. I.e water leaking at 1 am, etc. They are old too. They do not have elevators like Bullock or Wright. \n\nI was in Dodd for my freshman year. It\u2019s an only girls hall. I would really recommend this one if you are a girl. It\u2019s so peaceful! \n\nHope that helps",

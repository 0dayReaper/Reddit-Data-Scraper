    "postText": "Hey!! I am an incoming politic/IDSC major residing in a Hughes suite on the third floor :) I just wanted to reach out and ask about my residence hall (there is very minimal info abt Hughes online as I assume its an older building which institutions are less inclined to publicize) and any information anyone has about Hughes is MORE than welcome my way. Also if any current students or alum are from the pacific NW I would love to hear about your experience at Clark!! feeling a bit worried bout leaving this environment behind. thanks so much!!",

            "comment": "One thing about Hughes I wish I knew going in is that, while most other forms have a common room on each floor, Hughes only has a common room in the basement, and the common room isn't as well-furnished as other freshmen dorms. This makes it a bit harder for Hughes to be a hangout place, but the trade-off is that the rooms themselves are a bit bigger than the rooms in other doors. \n\nAlso something that you may/may not know is that Hughes 3rd floor is technically the \"wellness floor\" on campus, meaning that it's supposed to be substance-free and a bit stricter when it comes to drinking/smoking. I didn't live on that floor, but I know from people that did that it's not actually that much harder for students to drink/smoke up there if that's what you're into, but it is technically a substance-free floor. \n\nI'm not from the pnw but I stayed in Hughes last year as a first year, so I can answer any other questions about Hughes that you may have!",

Yes, I was a bit worried about the wellness floor situation as I personally smoke and drink but RLH emailed my suite and said we were just placed there due to space, and my suite mates all partake in smoking and drinking so I am hoping that we are good if we are discrete (?) and I was thinking that freshmen buildings are probably also technically substance free - not sure if that is true or not but I assumed. I was wondering what you know about how suites are set up in terms of floorpans and any other info about the physical space.\n\nThanks so much again!!\n\nThanks s",

The suite common rooms are relatively big, with 4 double rooms and a bathroom with two showers. \n\nI would suggest bringing plenty of decoration stuff, it is pretty drab and depressing in there without it, it's not very well lit either.\n\nAlso, idk exactly what the walls are made out of but that material makes it tough to hang posters and stuff, you're gonna want poster putty to hang stuff.",

But the idea that Hughes third floor is the \u201cwellness floor\u201d is hilarious to me. It was the last of the *smoking* floors when I was there. Like, you can smoke cigarettes in your room, smoking floor. I remember going home at the end of the year and realizing everything I owned smelled not-so-faintly of nicotine and weed.\n\nAlso, \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb hi from another pnw transplant! I **still** live in New England and miss home terribly. I loved my time at Clark and where life has taken me after, so no regrets, but home sickness is real.",

The rooms may have been bigger but the architecture inside is super isolating, there aren\u2019t many common spaces, the heating and cooling is wack, and lots of the windows don\u2019t work. Otherwise it is in a great spot on campus and the quad outside it is pretty awesome.",

My experience at Clark has been pretty good so far, one thing is the majority of students here live at least somewhat close so they leave during the shorter breaks (like this weekend lol). So it might be a good idea to find someone to stay with over long weekends unless you don't mind being kinda lonely on campus. Winter here is waaay colder, which sounds pretty obvious but one thing I was unprepared for was just how much it forces you to stay inside for the season, which can get pretty rough for some. Also I know this is late but I was in Hughes last year, it was...a time lol. I don't know if you've heard anything about the \"animal incident\" but shit got pretty wild. Hoping for your sake that Hughes has gotten saner this year!",

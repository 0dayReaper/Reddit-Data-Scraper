But a thing to keep in mind is that some don\u2019t spend a lot of time in the room, or more withdrawn, or a little messy, so it may not help. \n\nHowever, when Clark matches you up with someone they ask how clean you like your living space (it says either \u201cclean\u201d or \u201ca little messy\u201d but pick clean unless you\u2019re an absolute slob). I think there\u2019s also stuff like when you guys wake up/go to bed, so it\u2019s a pretty good system they have to limit problems.\n\nAs for the rest of this year, I recommend doing work at the library! There\u2019s different floors ranging in how quiet/social they are, so if you\u2019re on the lower levels there\u2019s lots of people and it\u2019s a pretty nice atmosphere :) even if you don\u2019t talk to anyone, it can still be nice to just be around other people while you work.\n\nIf you really want to switch rooms now, I think the room change deadline isn\u2019t over yet so you might be able to get a roommate, but the chances are low",

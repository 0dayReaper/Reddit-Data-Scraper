    "postText": "Hi! I'm an international student (rising senior in high school), and im thinking of going early decision with Clark. However, I'm not sure whether that's gonna affect my schedule and make me move into the dorms earlier and, since I will be sitting for the panhellenic exams as well, I wouldn't want to miss them if I got accepted. So, I'd like to know if they make you move in earlier than normal if you get accepted for ED.",

If you take the same classes and get the same grades at both schools you\u2019ve really got the same chance.\n\nIf you\u2019re dead set on transferring and know you will be admitted as a transfer, consider a community college, you\u2019ll save a fuckton of money. \n\nAlso were you waitlisted or outright denied from the other schools? I\u2019ve seen a lot of people plan to transfer but never actually get admitted as a transfer (probs shoulda realized when they were denied in high school) and then they just have an all around shitty experience because when they could have been making connections and maximizing their time on campus, they didn\u2019t because they were planning to transfer.",

    "postText": "Hey Everyone!\n\nI am a dental hygiene student at MCPHS Worcester and I am looking for patients so that I can fulfill my requirements for patient care. I will be doing multiple assessments (including periodontal disease, cavities and oral cancer), x-rays (if needed), comprehensive exam, cleaning, and fluoride. All of this is included in the fee - if you require a deep cleaning there will be an additional fee. No insurance needed!! All ages welcomed!\n\nAdults: $25\nChildren: $15\nSeniors: $15\nStudents: $5\nVeterans: free!\n\nMy availability for the summer is below (please be sure you are available AT LEAST 2 of the days/times given below - may require more if you have not been to the dentist in years). I am a student and I am required to have everything checked by my instructors as well as a comprehensive exam, so it takes longer.\n\nPlease email nviry1@stu.mcphs.edu or text 774-708-2731 if you are interested. Thank you!!",

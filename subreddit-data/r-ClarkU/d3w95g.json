    "postText": "so far during my time at clark i've only eaten on campus at the caf. a lot of people i know seem to prefer the bistro, but i've never gone there because honestly... the whole \"swap\" thing is hard to wrap my head around and i have so many questions and i don't want to stand there asking the employees all of them.\n\nfor one, the menus are kind of unclear in some places on which things are swappable. for instance, on the seasons menu, can i assume basically everything is swappable? cause there's no specific indications. on the grill, certain types of burgers are marked swappable and others are not, which makes sense - but are the cheese and toppings always included, or are they not included as part of the swap since they don't have the SW icon? and since the menu states \"swap includes one beverage and one side\" does that mean if, for instance, i ordered fries with my burger, they count as a \"snack\" and i couldn't also get fruit or chips or something like that? and also i thought i saw a drink fountain/machine in there - am i being *watched* to make sure i only get one fill, or are there canned drinks and stuff like that which only count as the single beverage?\n\ni'm sure a lot of this sounds dumb as hell but this whole thing makes me anxious and i just wanna eat somewhere else fot once\n\n(also i'm posting this from a throwaway cause i don't want to tie in my online aliases with places i'm at irl)",

            "comment": "So in general if an item has an Sw it is swappable. If you were to get a burger the swap comes with lettuce, cheese and a tomato (and two sides ). If you want other toppings you would have to pay extra using dining dollars. If you want a fountain drink this counts as one of the two sides. only fountain drinks, milk, coffee and tea can be used as sides. The bottled drinks are not swappable. As for snacks only the snacks labeled with an SW count as a side and fries count as one side.  Hope this helps.",

That said, you don\u2019t have to get a drink. You can, for example, swap for say chicken tenders, fries, and a yogurt. Also if you get chicken in a salad that doesn\u2019t include chicken, chicken will count as a swap.",

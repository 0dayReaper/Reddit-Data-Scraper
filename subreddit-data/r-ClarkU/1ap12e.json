    "postText": "Hey Clarkies,\n\nI graduated in '07, and took among other things Nat Seale's pre school psychology sequence/human services course in the education department. Every year the state school psychologist's association honors various folks, one for being a friend to children. I'm putting together some recommendations for prof Seale, and wanted to reach out to fellow Clarkies to see if they would like to share a recommendation. Please share this with anyone who might want to submit. I haven't told professor Seale in an effort to keep it a surprise.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

    "postText": "Hey, I recently got admitted to the PhD Economics program at Clark. Can any Econ PhD student/alum of Clark please tell me how the program is? I am waiting for other universities to respond but sadly its been rejections/implicit rejections. I am worried Clark is low ranked, but given that I wish to study developmental, political economics and want to pursue non academic jobs such as in the UN (no banks though) how is Clark in terms of such connections and course work?\n\nThey have given me full funding, and I am an international student who is also probably getting her living expenses paid for by a scholarship program, this deal seems like a good option but the only issue is that I have not heard much about Clark. It's rated RNP on USNews and I'm assuming its low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

Your best bet is not to ask people at Clark, but to ask people in your field how Clark is perceived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, it's a good school. Its undergrad program is fairly highly rated, given the size of the school. There are lots of international students, both grad and undergrad. Maybe consider visiting - that'll give you a sense of the place.",

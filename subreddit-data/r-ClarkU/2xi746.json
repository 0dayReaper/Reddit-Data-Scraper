    "postText": "Cinema 320 in Clark University is back this spring! There are thousands of pictures published every year, but you never have a chance to watch because there's no resource! Try Cinema 320 if you are interested in independent movies, documentaries, winning products in film festivals but are never published in big film theaters.\n\nMore information: https://cinema320.wordpress.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/cinema320\n\nps. it is always good to bring Clark ID or your kids with Clark IDs  XD\n ",

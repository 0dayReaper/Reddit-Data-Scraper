It\u2019s a very laid back school and a lot of the students are mature for their age.  Obviously there are exceptions, but most Clark students were very intelligent and independent.",

As far as integrating with the campus, I was required to take an FYI since I was a freshman because lack of credit transfer and that really helped with the adjustment process. If you have any questions more in-depth feel free to ask!",

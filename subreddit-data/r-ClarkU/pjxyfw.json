I am looking to fulfil my requirements for my last semester of clinic and have multiple appointments open to schedule patients! \n\nOur appointments are only $5 for students and include numerous assessments, x-rays, a cleaning as well as fluoride treatment! \n\nIf you or someone you know are interested, feel free to contact me via email: [hbrowne3@elon.edu](mailto:hbrowne3@elon.edu) \n\nThanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnl8id2vt5m71.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7b3cdb8b70e68ce4bbe62ef9715ce1ab3f2d0a5e",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm a prospective game design student at Clark who wanted to reach out and ask if any current students could provide some insight about their experiences with the program. I'm aware that clark allegedly is a pretty venerated institution in the field of game design (rank 3 in the world) but Im curious if that notoriety is in any way conducive to actually landing jobs &amp; internships or if it's just an arbitrary metric used to quantify the subjective quality of the major. Information about the program is very scarce, most likely due to how recently it was acquired from Becker. I can't find any examples of student work, student perspectives, working alumni linkedin profiles, etc. so this subreddit was the next place I thought to turn.",

            "comment": "Hello! I transferred my junior year of undergrad from Quinnipiac University's game development program. I went through about three years and finished the MFA program at Becker/Clark. I can speak to the program a bit for you. \n\nThe program is designed to teach you what specific field in game development you would want to go into. If you want to go into programming for example, your four years will be dedicated to learning C# and scripting within Unity. The other half of the program is taking part in studios where you work together as a team to create a game project. \n\nI have many thoughts about the program itself and how it can improve, but overall I feel the design is pretty good. When I was applying for game dev programs, I was between Becker (at the time) and Quinnipiac. I ended up choosing QU because the program was on the rise and I ended up transferring because I found out I really liked game production and Becker had a program for it. \n\nI think the most valuable part of the program isn't the program itself actually, its MassDigi. MassDigi is an organization that WAS at Becker, but is hosted at WPI now. However, there is still a strong connection on Clarks campus where it still meets. MassDigi is an organization dedicated to taking talented college game devs and training them to make high quality games to put on their portfolio and gain industry standard skillsets. The main person who runs it is named Monty and he has a bunch of connections and will help you get an internship and job if you put in the work. I recommend going straight for MassDigi as a freshman.\n\nI also wouldn't put much thought into the Princeton review's standing of any program on that list. I've heard from students that the schools just pay them to put them at that ranking.\n\nThats the general gist of it, I am of course open to answering your questions. Its most likely easier to anything specific that you have thoughts about.",

    "postText": "Hi there! I was wondering how dyslexic students fare at Clark. Are professors supportive and not resistant to accommodations? Are the accommodations easy to get, or does it feel like you have to jump through a lot of hoops?\n\nAny information related to this or the general academic atmosphere would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks :)",

But some universities have excellent offices (Fairleigh-Dickinson and Xavier for example), and some are notoriously unhelpful, professors unwilling to acknowledge accommodations, etc. (NYU). Others have decent services, but students have several hoops to jump through every semester. I was wondering if anyone here had first-hand experience asking for/receiving accommodations at Clark.",

    "postText": "Hello! I've recently been admitted to clark and am interested in pursuing the Columbia 3-2 engineering program. I noticed that on Clarks website it states that admission to Columbia is guaranteed so long as a 3.3 gpa is maintained and a few additional requirements are met. However, on Columbias website it states that admission is no longer guaranteed and applicants are reviewed in a holistic process. Is admission guarenteed for Clark students who meet the relevant requirements? I just wanted to see if anyone could clear this up for me. Thanks in advanced for your time :)",

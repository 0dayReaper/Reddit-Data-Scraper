I am planning on majoring in Biology or Molecular Biology and would like to know if undergraduates are often conducting research with professors at the university. \n\nIf anyone has any experience with research at Clark or knows anyone who has, I would love to know.\n\nThanks!",

One was a work study program starting my sophomore year and one was a LEEP program that let me stay and work over one of the summers. The earlier you start talking to Professors about opportunities, the better off you'll be - some students do research even in their freshmen year. It's not too competitive to get into just any lab but you'll have more chances to work in a preferred lab if you start looking into your opportunities early.",

Try this link: https://www2.clarku.edu/departments/biology/research/gallery.cfm\n\nBefore you work in a lab, I recommend talking to other students who work in that lab or have worked in it. Some professors devote a lot more time to their research than others. It's also useful to look at how frequently each professor publishes papers. You don't want to end up working in a lab that hasn't produced a paper in 15 years, *trust me.*",

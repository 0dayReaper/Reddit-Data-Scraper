    "postText": "I have recently received admit into Clark University with a good scholarship for the MS in Environmental Science and Policy course. I wanted to find out more information regarding the course and how it is but all I could find was a single Reddit post. Are there any students studying there right now or maybe an alumni who can just let me know what you think of the course along with what kind of opportunities you get upon taking it up? I would love to know what kind of employment opportunities people have received. I have accepted CU Denver's MS Environmental Science offer but I  would love to take up Clark instead since the ranking is so much better. Just need some more info on how the course is. Thank you so much.",

Opportunities outside of Massachusetts weren't really well known, so I had to do a lot of my own research.\n\nI'm not sure what rankings you're referring to, but it look like CU Denver's program has more faculty, with a wide range of experience in environmental sciences, than Clark.",

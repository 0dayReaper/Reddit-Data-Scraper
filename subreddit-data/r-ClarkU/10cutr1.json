    "postText": "Hello!\n\nSo I was recently accepted to Clark's MFA program in Interactive Media. Insofar, as I've gathered that Clark is a very LGBTQ friendly place and has a very good game design department/interactive media. \n\nI would like to know if anyone would throw in your experiences on your life at Clark. Do you like it? Are you close to your classmates? Are you close to the staff (dis do be important for doing an MFA XD)? \n\nAlso if anyone is in the Interactive Media department (MFA or no) It'd be neat if you could share your experiences directly related to that.",

            "comment": "Hello. I just graduated with an MFA in interactive media from Clark. I don't have much experience with life at Clark because I was a Becker transfer from the school shutting down but the program itself is good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an MFA student, the first year is dedicated to taking classes and doing a project that year to present at the end. It can be related to whatever you're studying in game design (art, programming, animation, production, sound, etc). \n\nThen in your 2nd year, you have to write a thesis and design a game related to your thesis. For your game, you get to run your own game studio with undergrads for 2 semesters with the end goal of eventually presenting alongside your thesis defense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI chose to focus on game production as a game producer and I wrote about game production malpractice in the game industry. Then I also ended up using my research to practice different production methods on my team. My experience was a lot of work but I ended up learning a lot about what game producers do. With preparation, you can truly make the program whatever you want it to be. Which I appreciated from Professor Ulm and Professor Theinert. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to reply. I will do my best to answer for you.",

                    "comment": "Wow. That actually seems like a pretty practical program. Also interesting that you run a game studio with undergrads. That sure seems like it would both help you learn how to A.) manage a team and B.) work with undergrads in an academic setting (which is good considering an MFA is a terminal degree). Feel free to correct me if my assumptions are wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, would you say that the professors are very involved? Like, are they good at mentoring or are they super hands off?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlsssooo how are your career prospects now that you've graduated? Do you feel the program set you up to be successful? Are they good at helping you network?",

                            "comment": "The program is very hands-on. My experience was very self-driven to be honest as I knew from the start what my plan was. It's designed to help you experience what it's like to be a leader in an academic setting since you CAN teach with a master's degree. I saw it as a producer experience for me. \n\nProfessor Theinert is the head of the program and Professor Ulm I viewed more as \"second\" in charge. Theinert was pretty involved with my academic planning and being on top of making sure I graduated on time. I think it says a lot about her character to let me join the program in the spring instead of the fall because I transferred from Quinnipiac University's game program. They usually do not allow you to join in the spring, but I was so close they allowed me to join the 4+1.\n\nUlm is there as the class professor in your MFA-related coursework. She's there to help guide you to make sure you know what you're doing most of the time. As I said, I knew what I was doing so I didn't have many meetings with her other than check-ins. But, I know my classmates met with her a lot so it seems the faculty is what you make of it for the program. The faculty for your non-MFA-related coursework is usually very helpful and nice as well. If you want to be involved with them, I am sure they will take you up on the offer as long as you're a good student of course.\n\nI am not sure if my job hunting is worthwhile to you because I am a producer lol, but I did work at an educational game studio in Boston from May of last year to January of this year. I will always say to new people that join/are interested in this program TO JOIN MASSDIGI. MassDigi is a group that used to be at Becker but now is at WPI which is dedicated to college game devs. The guy who runs it is named Monty and he is an amazing connection. As long as you're passionate, he will help get you a job. Luckily, the group for Clark for the MassDigi club is called IDGA and they're starting to meet again. JOIN THE DISCORD for it because there is a tremendous amount of graduates in there (including me) who are connections just sitting there. They will give you amazing advice, trust me. \n\nOther than that, my contract ended with the company I work for so I am now job hunting. I have gotten a decent amount of interviews just in the past couple of weeks. Again, not sure if that helps because it's about how much work YOU put into yourself and your portfolio. The program will certainly help you understand what that means though.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",

                    "comment": "Hi, I am also a student who received the program this year. I was accepted through a digital painting portfolio. I studied film as an undergraduate, and I actually know nothing about making a running well game, I mean programming, modeling, etc. The skills I do have are drawing, game mechanics planning, script writing (specifically, how to present a story in a game), in other words, I'm good at these creative jobs rather than technical ones. Do you think I'm a good fit for this project? Also, is it difficult to maintain a 3.2 gpa, as my tuition discount requires a 3.2.\n\nI read your comment, do you mean that the graduate students are only responsible for the general framework of the game and the specific work doesn't need to be done by myself.",

                            "comment": "Hello,\n\nJust in my opinion it doesn\u2019t sound like an amazing fit for you because the MFA program is built off of the original game design program. If you know nothing about making a game, the program will be significantly harder for you.\n\nThe first year is dedicated to making two projects over the course of two semesters while you take your first year classes. \n\nThen the second year you have to come up with a thesis paper topic to write that connects to the game project you build with a team of undergrad game design students as well as your other classes going on at the same time.\n\nAs the leader of your project, you do have to contribute to the game itself. Game design isn\u2019t just about the creative portions of it especially in the small team atmosphere of the program. Even though I was the producer, I did all the audio for my game as well. \n\nIt\u2019s your decision, but to me it\u2019s hard to justify jumping into games with no experience in a masters program with just film experience. The two mediums share some similarities, but making games is very difficult and to have no background in it would make the program hard for you in my opinion. One year of practice isn\u2019t enough to get a solid foundation before jumping into a big project. \n\nIt\u2019s your decision though at the end of the day. If you think you can get enough of a foundation in a year, that\u2019s your choice.",

But I had my doubts that I would survive in this program. And now it seems that's true, lol. \n\nBy the way, I wish you the best of luck with your new job!",

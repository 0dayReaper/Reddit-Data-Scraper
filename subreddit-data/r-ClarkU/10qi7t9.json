All of that was folded into Clark, and the main reason (at least I think) was to improve the existing Clark program. \n\nMy roommate was a comp sci major in undergrad 2011 and is now a game developer. I\u2019d imagine the program is as good as many, but it\u2019s all about what you personally put into it. You can go to the best school and mess around or the worst school and dedicate yourself and build an amazing portfolio. So it\u2019s up to you!",

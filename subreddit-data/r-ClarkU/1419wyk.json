    "postText": "First, I was wondering what the academic load/level is like. I'm sure it depends on the classes but what would you say is the typical workload? (ex. length of final essays, amount of readings) I also took the IB in high school so I would love some input from IB graduates too!\n\nI'm also curious about the social life is like at Clark. I'm not really into partying (my last school was really into that) and I was wondering if Clark's social life also mainly revolves around partying. Also, as an international student, I would love to hear from other international students!\n\nAlso, I'm hoping to major in Global Env Studies and International Development and Social Change so if anyone has taken either of these I would love to hear your opinions.",

            "comment": "International alumni \n\nThe workload is entirely dependent on certain classes and majors. It\u2019s on the lighter side. For an IB graduate it\u2019s going to be fairly easy for the first two years. Junior year and onwards gets harder but still manageable. Thesis papers can go upwards of 50-100 pages but regular essays never get super cumbersome. This bites you in the back if you end up going to a harder school temporarily (study abroad) or for your masters as the workload will be decidedly more technical. For example, people who do a study abroad in LSE for a year for Economics have a 100% academic suffering rate. \n\nClark is not a party school. It may seem that way to some people who have only ever gone to Clark. But it is not. You will have maybe 1-3 decent parties a weekend to choose from, and the rest of your social time is decidedly spent through clubs. You CAN party, and I would say it\u2019s worth it for\u2026character development\u2026to go to some here or there when you have some stable friends. Lucky for you, ISA is one of the biggest clubs on campus, so you have plenty of social life opportunity to fill your life with without resorting to partying.",

Would you say that students are generally friendly? I have also heard that students are socially conscious and passionate and was wondering if that was actually true...",

It\u2019s easy to get started in ISA, MUN, or anything else. And the social life comes with it. \n\nStudents are definitely socially conscious and passionate. Compared to a bigger school for sure. But most people are just there to study, have fun, and have a good time. There\u2019s clubs dedicated to various forms of political or geopolitical justice. There\u2019s light and partly liberal-arts washed forms of protest around various issues. And since 2000+ born people are generally more liberal than 80-2000, it\u2019s shifting more left. \n\nColleges are not incredibly center or right leaning in the US in general. Clark a tad bit more left than normal. \n\nCollege is very different from high school in general. You can be as weird as you want at Clark. Nobody will bat an eye. It\u2019s a weird school by design. One dude used to wear an elephant hat and walk around giving out tickets on Thursdays to people wearing Gray. You could redeem them for elephant plushies at the end of the semester.",

    "postText": "Hi, I would like to know Your opinions is it worth to apply to Clark's University Polish campus in Warsaw for the Master of Science in Information Technology studies. This program is held in cooperation with Polish mid-tier private university (regarding prestige), but the master degree is the same as the awarded in Worcester. The tuition fees are very reasonable  - about 4.600 USD for entire 2 years studies.\n\n I am still wondering about different schools for my graduate studies so I would be glad to hear Your points of view.\n\nHere is the link to the program description and its curriculum\n\n[http://www.clarkuniversity.eu/our-programs/master/master-of-science-in-information-technology/curriculum](http://www.clarkuniversity.eu/our-programs/master/master-of-science-in-information-technology/curriculum)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

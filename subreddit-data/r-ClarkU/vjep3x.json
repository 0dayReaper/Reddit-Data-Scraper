The professors are very friendly, lots of research opportunities and well connected for jobs in the area. Imo you could set yourself up well for research or professional work afterwards. I'm not at all familiar with Amherst, but I would heavily consider the financial aid packages for each and choose the cheaper one.",

Personally enjoyed the program and have been gainfully employed both in govt remote sensing and private sector GIS consulting since and have crossed paths with many other Clark Geography alum along the way.",

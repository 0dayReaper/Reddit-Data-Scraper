    "postText": "I\u2019m in between being in Boston or being in Worcester for school. \n\nI\u2019m in community college in PA and planning on transferring as a junior. I\u2019ve lived in Boston for a few weeks and really loved it. I toured the campus and didn\u2019t really like the city/area but it was also the summer. \n\nI just have a few questions:\n1) what is campus life like? \n2) what do people typically do on a Friday night? \n3) are there any particular clubs you can join to meet people? I know there is no Greek life so how is that like? \n4) does the school help you out with internships? \n5) is the city safe? \n6) do students typically go to nearby campuses (wpi, holy cross?) \n\nDo you like the campus? Any feedback is appreciated.",

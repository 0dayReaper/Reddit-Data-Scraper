Could anyone give me their thoughts on the courses that they've had here under those two majors, and give some advice regarding preparation? (ie for CS, what coding  languages should I learn beforehand, or any textbooks to read for econ?)\n\nHope to see you all this fall!",

            "comment": "took intro to CS and loved it, made me interested in the field with no prior knowledge. clarks strong point is allowing flexibility and exploration for students and you wont have to declare until your 4th semester as an undergrad. you could also take your First Year Intensive (a required seminar for all first year students) in either of those fields to get a little more in-depth experience that is still tailored to beginners. HOWEVER: if you want to double major, make sure you know what you would be getting yourself into. every major has a certain # of required classes, plus clark\u2019s blanket PLS requirements mean that, depending on which majors you choose, you might have to get started on filling requirements even before you declare your majors. CS should have an updated handbook somewhere online (just google \u201cclark university cs major requirements) but idk abt econ. you could definitely email or call the departments to ask for virtual copies of their major handbooks directly. if you have any questions lmk!",

I love being a CS major at Clark. Not much research but average for small liberal arts schools. \n\nJob placement is ok, many of our graduates went on to FAANG or other tech companies. It's a small school tho, so career fair is not the best. But being at a small school, I'm able to get so much more personal help from profs.",

    "postText": "I went to Clark many years ago, and my son has expressed interest in going there.\n\nBut the price-tag is pure sticker-shock.\n\nFor those of you who have gone to Clark recently, what kind of merit-aid did you get? Tuition reductions? Scholarships?\n\nI am adverse to taking out any student loans. But because of my net-worth, I am worried I will be forced to pay full-fair (which if I did would make a serious dent in my net-worth)",

            "comment": "Yes, the sticker price is crazy, but aid can be pretty generous. As part of the financial aid application process, you will complete the FAFSA which will determine your EFC (expected family contribution). Some schools also require the CSS to be completed (Clark does) which asks a bit more specifics on your financials.\nSchools will use this to determine their aid package.\n\nNote that the EFC calculations do not include any of your retirement account balances.\n\nWe were nervous we would be paying full fare but my son was awarded a scholarship amounting to $28k/year, plus some subsidized loans @ $5500/yr. You can opt out of the loans, if desired.\n\nIt\u2019s still a pretty penny, no doubt, but our State school (UMass Amherst) offered no aid and is only $4k less! So, my son will be starting at Clark this Fall!",

The merit-based scholarship opportunities and that none of your retirement account balances are included into your need calculations are important factors.",

I was top of my class in high school and had a lot of volunteer work and extracurriculars, so I was awarded the traina scholarship (merit) which is $20k a year (it\u2019s actually higher now, I think it\u2019s $26k for incoming freshman), i also get pell grant and federal seog grant which together is like $10k a year or something.  then the remaining like $8k a year i get out in loans, which im moving off campus next year and paying for it from my jobs so no more loans (they basically pay for my housing)! but yeah, I know this isn\u2019t typical, I don\u2019t pay more than $100 out of pocket a semester, but it\u2019s how it worked out being a low-income student.\n\nedit: also my bf\u2019s parents made like ~100k a year and I think he had to pay like 10k in, unsure though.  he also had some merit as well, though, as well as some loans.",

Clark gave me the most financial aid out of the schools I got into - They granted me the Traina merit scholarship ($28k per year), work study grant, Mass Pell grant (I\u2019m in state) and a few other scholarships to add up to a little over $57k! About $5k of that is loans if I remember correctly. Depending on what kind of dorm I\u2019ll live in, I will be paying $8k-$12k this upcoming year. For context, our total household salary is about $65k and I submitted both the FAFSA and CSS.\nHope this helps!",

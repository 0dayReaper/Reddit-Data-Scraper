    "postText": "Hi, i've just been accepted to Clark and I was wondering if any of you had some pros and cons to Clark. I'm currently planning on going in undecided possibly branching out to a environmental science or film major.  \nSo far, what im worried with in Clark is its small town and the safety of Worcester.\n\nAll my life i've lived in places that are really hard to walk around and that have no where to go, that is my main concern in applying to clark. Are there enough places around Worcester that you can go after classes to just relax or hang around? Do you feel like its safe enough to leave campus whenever you want (Within reasonable times/when the sun is still out)? Do you have fun off campus? is transportation good around town? if there arent places in Worchester, can you easily leave Worcester to go there? What is the worst part about clark? What is the best part about clark? how is the film program? how is the environmental science program? how is the undecided program? can you easily switch majors? Are professors understanding about extensions?   \n\n\nTL/DR: what are the pros and cons of being a student Clark?",

            "comment": "Hi, nobody is answering this so I will. There\u2019s an okay amount of things to do around worcester itself especially if you know where. a lot of restaurants around walking distance. in terms of safety, there are areas that are a bit shady, but if you\u2019re traveling with other people, or know your way around it isn\u2019t too much of an issue i would say? (maybe i\u2019m just brave) \n\ntransportation is solid, WRTA is the main bus system in the city, and then the Clark shuttle runs daily hitting a few key spots for college students in the city. The commuter rail runs right out of worcester to boston, so it\u2019s fairly easy to get to boston and or any of the main cities between worcester and boston. \n\nI have absolutely no clue concerning the film program or environmental science. The undecided program is solid though, you don\u2019t need to declare your major until the end of your second year. That allows you to move around and try what you might be interested in. Most professors are understanding about extensions and whatnot, ofc there are always exceptions but I haven\u2019t had too much of any issues in that regard.",

            "comment": "It is a bit tough because Worcester isn't extremely walkable, but it is possible and there are things to do. There are numerous restaurants/cafes around Clark. I don't typically go off campus to just hang out, but the on-campus options like the academic commons and the ASEC building are pretty good. It usually feels pretty safe to go off campus during the daytime, especially with a friend or a group, depending on the area. \n\nThe worst part about Clark is probably the food. It is usually mediocre to bad tbh, but I am also quite picky. Some of the food has been good, but Clark is really known for bad food. The best part about Clark is probably the people. I have met a lot of wonderful, kind people here and made some truly amazing friends. Clark just has good vibes. Another good thing is that there are a lot of clubs and organizations on campus to be a part of. \n\nThe film program seems to be pretty good. I have friends who are film majors and they enjoy it. I am not sure about the environmental science program. Some professors are strict with extensions and others are pretty chill and understanding, it just depends. But a lot of professors seem to understand that we are all under stress.",

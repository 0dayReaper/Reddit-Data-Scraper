    "postText": "I have read a great deal of posts on CC about separate and co-ed residential communal bathrooms at colleges in the United States. Seeing that Clark is a top pick for me, I wanted to know how the bathrooms are set up within Clark's dorm buildings (I believe there are at least six dorms on campus) in terms of gender (whether they are used by both genders or there are separated bathrooms). I have read a lot about this being a decision based on votes from the students in the dorms and that upperclassmen are usually the students that experience these types of bathrooms while first-years don't. Aside from all that, finally, I have read that many students also completely disregard the signage and occasionally go inside bathrooms corresponding to their opposite gender and it is no big deal. Is this true as well? Any input is greatly appreciated.",

Dodd is for female identifying students only so all the bathrooms there are essentially gendered although the layout is the same as JSC and Dana-Hughes.\n\nNot sure about Maywood or Blackstone but first years rarely if ever live there.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which dorms they\u2019re putting first years in next semester \u2013 while I\u2019ve been here they switched from Wright/Bullock/JSC/Dodd with Dana-Hughes going to upperclassmen, to Wright/Bullock/Dana-Hughes/Dodd with JSC going to upperclassmen.\n\nMy first year I lived in Wright and people occasionally ignored the gendered designations for bathrooms but not often enough that I\u2019d say it\u2019s a frequent occurrence. Nobody seemed to mind anyhow. Since then I\u2019ve lived in dorms with only coed bathrooms so the situation doesn\u2019t apply.",

I remember a lot about those days (while the dorms were renovated since then, they are still the same layout and design), I can't recall how many showers were in the larger bathrooms. It may be two showers, but I am leaning towards it only being one shower and two stalls. When I lived in Hughes, my half of my floor only had the single-use bathrooms, so I almost exclusively used those for showering and such.  If a shared two-shower bathroom mixed-gender is something that bothers you, it would be as simple as using the single bathrooms down the hall from the double bathrooms. \n\nA current student can answer your specific question better, though.",

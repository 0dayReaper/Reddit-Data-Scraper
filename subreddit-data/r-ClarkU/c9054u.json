While I haven\u2019t taken a CS class, I have some good friends (recently graduated seniors rip) who majored in CS, one recently started working at Amazon after an internship and the other is a software engineer at Trip Advisor!\n\nWhile I can\u2019t speak on behalf of the whole major, I know that based on the success of my friends that you have a great chance had finding your place in the CS major at Clark!",

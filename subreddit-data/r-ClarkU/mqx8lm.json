    "postText": "Hi! I am currently a female prospective student for Clark. I am still very undecided about my major, but if I do attend Clark, I am leaning towards Screen Studies or Media. Management also sounds interesting, but my passion lies in creativity! However, my main concerns about the school are the academic rigor, housing, and financial aid.\n\nI was given the Traina Merit Scholarship and a few other grants, making the school somewhat affordable. Do your grades affect your scholarships and financial aid? Is it common for the school to cut your financial aid?\n\nIs housing guaranteed for all 4-years? What is housing like at the school? Is it more common for students to live in campus apartments?\n\nDoes school work affect your social life? Do you constantly have to focus on studying over the weekends? My biggest fear is attending a school where I am constantly trapped in my room to keep my grades up.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of the school? What is the food like?\n\nIf anyone is majoring in Screen Studies, or Media, Culture, and Arts - it would be really nice if I could get insight on what it is like! Management sounds interesting too. Thanks!",

            "comment": "&gt;Do your grades affect your scholarships and financial aid? Is it common for the school to cut your financial aid? \n\nYes, I think you need to keep a certain GPA (it's probably like above a 3.0) but you should check with someone at the school related to financial aid or related to the scholarship. Even if you don't make the GPA, you have some a semester to get your GPA back up so they won't ever just cut funding for you (but double check to see that the funding you've received is for all 4 years and not a one time thing).\n\n&gt;Is housing guaranteed for all 4-years? What is housing like at the school? Is it more common for students to live in campus apartments? \n\nPretty much. From my experience, it's pretty rare that someone won't be able to live on campus if they want to for all 4 years. Depending on how they do the lottery and just luck it could happen differently. On campus housing is better in some dorms than others. First year dorms are good, Blackstone is great for Juniors and Seniors. I think it's split but pretty much everyone that goes to Clark lives in that little neighborhood there. There are lots of houses right by Traina which is where you'd be lots of the time if you were a screen studies major.\n\n&gt;Does school work affect your social life? Do you constantly have to focus on studying over the weekends? My biggest fear is attending a school where I am constantly trapped in my room to keep my grades up. \n\nNot if you are a Screen Studies major (no offense) and especially not if you have already gotten merit scholarships. College is harder than high school but Clark is not so challenging that smart and motivated people can't do well with relative ease. Everyone I knew had the work/life balance that they wanted. I probably had the worst just because I chose a hard major and also got a minor.\n\n&gt; What are the pros and cons of the school? What is the food like? \n\nThe food is actually good. The environment is great. Super multicultural and there's a lot of nice and creative/artsy people.\n\nI didn't do a screen studies major, I only took one class in the department but it was awesome. The professor I had unfortunately isn't there anymore (which is a real shame because she was fantastic). There's a digital library where you can go and rent movies and watch them on the school's equipment. Once a week we would have a showing of a movie on the big screen which is a legit movie theater in Traina. I wish I had taken more screen studies classes at Clark. Check out the [Screen Studies Program](http://catalog.clarku.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=25&amp;poid=4738&amp;returnto=2097) which will tell you what classes you have to take and what classes will be offered.",

It's honestly a travesty that I was issued a degree, and the world is worse for it. Loved Clark tho. \n\nAlso did a few screen studies classes and had a blast.",

            "comment": "Grades do affect your scholarships, but it's just keeping your GPA above a certain level. I'm not sure about the Traina scholarship, but the one I have requires me to keep a 2.5 or higher. I haven't heard of anyone getting their financial aid, but if you were to dip below the required GPA I'd imagine they'd give you a warning or something before just taking it away. \n\nI'm not 100% sure if on-campus housing is guaranteed for all 4 years but I definitely know some juniors and seniors that still live in the dorms. Living in off campus housing like apartments is definitely common, but not everyone does it. There are a ton of apartments all around campus so there are a lot of options. Housing, in my opinion, is pretty nice! I've lived in 2 different dorms throughout my time at Clark. I started off in Dodd Hall, then moved to Wright Hall, and for my sophomore year (my current year) I'm in Dodd again. Dodd is an all-girls dorm with 4 floors and a basement. The rooms are pretty big in my opinion as long as you arrange the furniture to maximize the space. There is one window in each room (a big one) and built-in closets, drawers, and a cupboard. The beds are loftable and you get a desk and a chair. The desks in every dorm gave a built-in desk lamp too. The common rooms in Dodd are small, but they're arranged in \"suite-style layouts.\" So you'll be in an area with a few neighbors and you get a full kitchen and bathroom basically right outside your door. You're still paying for a double though, rather than a suite. I love it in Dodd! No elevator though. Wright Hall is newer, but the rooms are smaller. Again, you of course get a bed, desk, and chair, and a built-in closet with shelves. The windows in Wright are also nice and big. There are 3 floors and a basement and an elevator. Wright and Bullock Hall are similar in age and style, and Dodd, Johnson-Sanford Center, Hughes, and Dana Hall are similar in style. There's also Maywood Hall which is I believe for mostly upperclassmen and I think it's entirely suites. Blackstone is super new and nice, and they have apartment-style living, and I also think that one is for mostly upperclassmen.\n\nI am a history major with an art history minor and I don't feel too overwhelmed with work all the time. There are definitely days where I have more work than others, but I don't feel like I'm stressing or working around the clock to keep my grades up. I also have an on-campus job and I still have plenty of free time to relax or whatever! \n\nThe food here is alright, but nothing special. We have a dining hall and a more \"to-go\" style place called the Bistro. In my opinion the Bistro is better but there are fewer options. They offer a wide variety of food in the main dining hall every day and have a good amount of vegetarian and vegan options too.\n\nI think the biggest pro of Clark are the people. The students and the professors! I feel like we have a good sense of community and people are really friendly here! The professors are mostly great, every now and then you might get an iffy one, you know, someone who takes a long time to grade or someone who makes lectures boring and bland. I haven't had any sort of awful experiences with professors yet though. I can't think of any major cons, maybe the overall price, and maybe the amount of things to do off-campus that are in walking distance. There are a ton of good restaurants but not much else nearby.\n\nI hope this helps a bit!!",

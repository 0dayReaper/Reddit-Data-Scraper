            "comment": "Text of the petition:\n\nOUR STATEMENT\n\nDear Members of the Clark Community,\nIt is with great concern and frustration that we address you all today. Anti-Blackness runs rampant in American and global society.  Black lives continue to be taken away with no warning and with no justice. More recently George Floyd, Sean Reed, Breonna Taylor, and so many more BLACK LIVES have been as a result of police brutality. The murder of our Black brothers and sisters exacerbates the trauma we continue to endure through our current system. Our current system is entrenched in racism and pervades the structures that govern and rule our society - Clark is not exempt from this system. Like many Black students who have walked the halls of this campus before us, we are outraged and remain unheard and unseen by Clark University. \n\nFor decades, the BLACK STUDENTS on our campus have attempted to initiate open and constructive conversations that could lead to the empowerment and liberation of Black students. In the late 1960s, the Black Student Union at Clark University presented a list of demands to the administration which included a demand for more Black students to be admitted to the institution. In 2016, a group of Black athletes and allies created another list of demands disturbingly similar to the one made more than half a century prior.  We have voiced our grievances and the university has intentionally neglected our demands. Black students at Clark University have faced racism in the classroom and on our athletic teams. We have witnessed racial slurs spoken from the mouths of non-Black students and professors. This past year, we held a discussion with our University Police during which students of color expressed the inadequate treatment they had received from the University Police. Despite all of our attempts, we have been ignored. Our question to the Clark University Administrative Board and Board of Trustees is: Why must we keep demanding equity and why are you not responding accordingly? \n\nWe are tired. We are tired of hearing our non-Black counterparts feel comfortable uttering racial slurs on campus. We are tired of our non-Black counterparts feeling comfortable taking up our spaces and speaking on our behalf. We are tired of having to move out of our dorms because of racist roommates. We are tired of professors not calling on their Black students in class unless it involves Black rhetoric. We are tired of hosting events and feeling terrified by the excessive amount of law enforcement present. We are tired of being told that you will \u201cget back to us\u201d when we voice our concerns. We are tired of having to educate others at a higher education institution about racism, a construct of oppression that we have endured first hand, while our non-Black counterparts feign \u201cignorance\u201d and are given a pass for racist behavior. \n\nTo the Clark University Administration, your silence and delayed response on this issue suggest that you do not value our BLACK LIVES. Last week, many universities swiftly published a statement acknowledging the racial injustices that have been overflowing in our country. Additionally, these universities outlined different resources and organizations that provide students with emotional support and proper resources. The most recent statement by President Angel and President-Elect Fithian stated that \u201cWithout change, we cannot end the fear that people of color, especially those who are Black/African Americans, live with daily.\u201d In short, ensuring to support us yet we have not received concrete information on how Clark plans to proceed or on new resources that are being put in place. \n\nIt is important to us that the demands listed below get addressed in a supportive and proactive manner.  The Clark Administration needs to demonstrate that they are committed to opposing and eradicating racial injustices on and off-campus.\n\nOUR DEMANDS\nWe demand that the University Police cut ALL ties to Worcester PD.\nWe demand that funds gained from this action be redistributed to resources that can support Black students on campus. \nWe demand University Police to stop carrying automatic and semi-automatic weapons and batons. \nWe demand ALL campus administrators, trustees, faculty, staff, and officers to undergo a required semi-annual anti-racism training as a supplement to our existing cultural competency training which has allowed Clark to give us a watered-down attempt of inclusivity. Additionally, the anti-racism training should focus on the trauma faced by Black people across the diaspora. We believe that a Black student representative should serve as a member of the committee that is in charge of creating such training.\nWe demand that the curriculum for the Cultural Competency Training be shared with the entire student body.\nWe demand that ALL undergraduate students, including student leaders such as Residential Advisors and Peer Mentors, and graduate students of Clark University be required semesterly cultural competency training and anti-racism training with a focus on Black racial injustices.\nWe demand to have a Black Student Union representative or Black faculty or staff on the search committee for the new Police Chief of Clark University.\nWe demand ALL racial and bias incidents reported to any faculty and administrators to undergo a full investigation that leads to disciplinary probation,  especially in matters of hate speech and harassment towards Black members of our community. \nWe demand that within these investigations, a representative of the Black Student Union member be present.\nWe demand more Black mental health practitioners and demand that they get paid an equal amount as their white counterparts along with sufficient funding to provide us with the proper health care to address the traumas of anti-Blackness.\nWe demand that ALL progress achieved to be shared with not only the Black Student Union but with the student body in the form of a semesterly report.\nThe reasons these injustices continue, without ramifications,  is due in part to the lack of Black presence on our campus - be it students, faculty, administrators etc. Historically, Clark University has minimized its responsibility of holding others accountable for racist and divisive behavior rather than owning their obligation to uphold university values of equity and inclusiveness. Clark University\u2019s inactions have inherently shifted this burden to Black students who are already tasked with the obligation to educate their peers and identify areas of oppression. While Black students should continue to have a seat at the table, it remains the University\u2019s responsibility to hold others accountable and seek solutions to address the underlying circumstances that allow for these incidents to continue. We call on the administration to critically analyze the resources for Black students that are in place and those that will be implemented in the future.\n\nWith Urgency,\n\nThe Black Student Union Executive Board",

                    "comment": "Thank you for posting. I will reserve my commentary on each point but say this much. There is a reason why some of these demands cannot be met. The school cannot provide stuff separate and unequal to other students. They'll get sued and likely lose in a court of law. Although some of it seems reasonable the unarming of the campus police is the naivest thing here. I live and grew up in Main South. I went to Clark for free because of it. That said, you do not want limited protection. And in the age of campus violence and active shooters, there needs to be something. I'm all for retraining though. Just my thoughts. I think the University hands are tied in federal statutes that will prevent many of these things.",

I\u2019d rather many people sign a petition with high demands and be met in the middle than water it down ahead of time in anticipation of lawsuits that do not exist and federal limitations that we are just guessing at.",

What do you think will happen here. That school has some large conservative pockets that people aren't aware of. Not all their donors are left leaning. Like any institution. They'll put money first.",

                                            "comment": "Dude, this is a baseless legal argument. You cannot bring up Title 9 in a discussion about race as if it has any relevance. The civil rights act banned discrimination on the basis of race but the Supreme Court still upheld that colleges could have racial quotas. Until a precedent is set by a court on measures to uplift black students (i.e University tries and gets sued) you most certainly are not in a position to speculate. \n\nThe school does not have \u201clarge conservative pockets\u201d it has 10% loud leftists and 5% loud conservatives and 85% of people who don\u2019t give a fuck about either. \n\nYou\u2019re not their accountant and nobody has asked you to go through their financial books to justify invalidating an attempt at further diversity and inclusion with hypotheticals of their donour base. Leave that to the institution.",

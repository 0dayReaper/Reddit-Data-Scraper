What about GISDE sold you? And are you not interested in the grad housing - that's what i was gonna look into. ",

I did look into it, and would have been interested in the grad housing, but from what I read I don't believe they allow pets. \n\nBasically, I only applied to 3 schools. I got into two (including Clark) and the other I still haven't heard from. Since Clark is the best of the two that I have been accepted into, it was an easy choice. The other I am waiting on explicitly told me during an interview that I should not expect any funding, while Clark has offered me an AmeriCorps scholarship. That was my main reasoning, although I do have some friends and family in the Massachusetts area that make going to Clark more attractive as well.\n\n Anyway, don't think you or I could go wrong with Clark! Their course offerings are great, and I've only heard good things about the faculty.",

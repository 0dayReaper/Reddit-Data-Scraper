            "comment": "Glad to hear you're considering transferring. Clark is very receptive to transfers, I have known a few and they tended to have good experiences. Long as you join clubs, connect with people, etc., make a reasonable effort to make friends you'll be fine. It's a small enough uni that you won't be any kind of an outcast. The only draw back is traditionally they have housed transfers in a first year dorm, however they did away with this last year, unsure if it's for good or not though. Feel free to pm me about other questions and I can give you more deets. I can have my friend send you a message  about his transfer experience if need be.",

I've attached a copy of all the PLS classes for this semester to give you an idea of the PLS's and what classes fulfill them. I've heard some people say it's hard to transfer credits in, but I know two people who had all of their credits transfer over. Coming from Amherst Clark probably already knows what classes should transfer over etc. http://www2.clarku.edu/offices/registrar/courses/Spring-Term-PLS-Courses.pdf",

By the time I really felt at home it was time to graduate and even one more year on campus would have been nice.\n\nI was mostly friends with other transfers but people branch out at their own pace. It depends on how active you choose to be in your department(s) and around campus in general/connecting with others just like /u/Climboy55 said. \n\nI'm still close with a few good friends from Clark, and most of them were also transfers.  Like any college experience, it will be what you make of it.  Be prepared for lots of harmless but still ultimately weird questions about you being a transfer no matter where you end up moving, if you decide to go for it.  Good luck!! :-)",

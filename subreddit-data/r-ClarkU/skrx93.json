    "postText": "is the CSS profile required for submission for everyone? does everyone have to submit no matter their income? bc online it says only families with an AGI over $100,000 have to submit but also says all students seeking need based financial aid have to complete it too? i\u2019m positive my FAFSA got completely messed up (not just bc of what\u2019s happening with clark but also other reason, my parents tax advisor legit doubled my dads income by accident,) and clark is requiring me to do it, even though my parents don\u2019t make over $100,000 in a year. should i file it with the wrong information and resubmit later? or just leave it alone and fix my FAFSA information?",

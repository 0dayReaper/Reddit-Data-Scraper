Anyone with a penis attempting to cross the barrier is instantly dealt a fat slap of voltage until their hearts give out. The only way for men to enter Dodd is by swiping a janitor's ID card and taking the maintenance tunnel under the school. But then you'll have to make it past the tunnel's guardian, something no one has been able to achieve since Goddard.",

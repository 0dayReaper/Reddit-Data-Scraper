    "postText": "Hi! My son was recently admitted to Clark for Fall 2018. He's interested in majoring in CS, but Clark has such a small CS department. In fact, it's combined with the math department. The course requirements look good, comparable to other CS department requirements, but there isn't much variety in terms of elective CS courses. Does anyone have first or second hand impressions of CS at Clark? In particular, do graduates find good jobs? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Unfortunately it's really not the name of the school that helps with jobs at this point. I tried for a CS major at Clark and ended up dropping the major because I didn't like the professors who taught the first few courses. I work in a CS adjacent field now, and I can't stress enough that employers want to see previous work experience, not a CS degree from a non-CS school. \n\nAlso, if he's still at Clark, I definitely recommend classes with Prof. Germinal Isern - I took a few COPACE night courses toward the end of my time at Clark and he was easily one of the best professors there.

One of my friends really got close with some professors and mentored him personally. They helped him do an ind\u00e9pendant study and present it at different conferences. My other friend didn\u2019t really get along with the professors due to her learning style but she earned the degree and learned a lot. At least at a small school you may find some professors you really get along with and they can help you a lot on a personal level. ",

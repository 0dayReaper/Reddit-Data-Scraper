            "comment": "I recently graduated from this program and tbh I wouldn't recommend it if you have other options. Initially I was very excited for a professionally-oriented program that was interdisciplinary, but the program just doesn't have the courses, professors, or expertise to really come through.\n\nAt the moment I think there are only 2 professors for this program, and both only have academic experience (i.e. no real life policy experience). Some of the course material is incredibly out of date (stuff dated back to 2010) and I was really disappointed that analysis skills were very sparse, if at all included. And the extent of the policy curriculum wasn't much more than an overview of the 3 federal branches of U.S. government.\n\nMost of your courses are taken with undergraduates, who are participating in a 4+1 program, but the level of teaching is definitely geared more towards undergrads than professionals with work experience. Many of my classmates who had work experience in the environmental field were disappointed in the program. The variety of courses is also very limited due to the size of the department. I mostly took courses from the Geography department.\n\nImo this program is good if you want more of an international development focus, since most professors and courses are for that program. It's also convenient if you just want to design your own curriculum (from a limited number of courses) and have a STEM degree. The university community is also really nice - students are really progressive and kind, and I think the professors try to be too.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have anymore questions!",

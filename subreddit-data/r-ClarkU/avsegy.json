Some of our favorite collaborations in biology involve our friends in the art department.   \nFor example, the last time I taught Botanical Diversity (BIOL 110) we collaborated with a botanical illustrator who led some drawing workshops. We then made posters of plants in Clark's Hadwen Arboretum, that were displayed here in the Lasry Center for Bioscience. If you're interested in integrating art and science we can certainly find some opportunities.\n\nCheers, \n\nDavid H.",

This includes Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. Most were receiving funding from Clark or Professor's grants. the summers here are fun--we have a nice community, and it's warm.\n\n(2) Yes, we can arrange off-campus research as internships or as directed research experiences for course credit. This kind of activity is very important to us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers,\n\nDavid H.",

I teach Ecology, which is great because I get the chance to take students outside during lab for field work.  But, I also really love teaching Intro to Biostatistics.   So many students are nervous about both math and coding (incredibly important skills these days), and I get the chance in Biostatistics to teach both in a way that make it accessible and fun.   \n\nThanks!\n\nProf. Mathis",

And so what if the guy the building's named after is dead.  If he's dead and his family who run Purdue have nothing to do with Clark anymore than why the hell won't you change the name of the building?  I'll tell you why.  Because Clark is still clearly receiving money from the family that makes all their money off of killing and imprisoning black people!  And the science department has nothing to hide about it's funding sources than release the tax form of all donations going to Clark University to prove that no one in the family or from Purdue or any of its subsidiaries funds Clark anymore!  If you got nothing to hide then you got nothing to fear!",

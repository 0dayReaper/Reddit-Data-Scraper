    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI just got accepted to Clark's graduate program in GIS! I was wondering if anyone has any information on the graduate student demographics (like breakdowns of age, gender, race, degree, international, etc). I'm super curious,  especially the gender breakdown in GIS.  I am a woman, so I am wondering if most of my classmates will be men since GIS is a tech field. This of course wouldn't be an issue, but I just want to know what to expect. It is usually easy to find this information for undergrad, but not for grad. The accepted student's page on FB is mostly people looking for apartments and doesn't seem to be up to date, so it's hard to get an idea of what my class will be like. If anyone has additional information to share about the MS in GIS program or about Clark Grad in general, please feel free to share.",

I agree that many grad programs, especially ones for very specific subjects, don't have stats available which can make it really frustrating when applying. I definitely would like to know more too. Glad to hear that at least there will be one other woman in the master's program lol",

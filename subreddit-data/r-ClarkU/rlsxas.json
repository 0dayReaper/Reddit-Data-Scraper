    "postText": "I got into to Clark yesterday, with a $68,000 scholarship! I want to be a physics major with a potential double major in math.\n\nAnyway, how's the physics major? Is it easy to double major? How's the social scene - not parties, night clubs, etc but rather just the people at the school? Does Clark ever feel too small socially, like is it one of those everyone-knows-everyone atmospheres? How do you like Worcester?\n\nI haven't gotten a chance to visit campus, how's the campus also?\n\nI'm not worried about the financial aspect of it because of the scholarship making the tuition cheaper. Thanks!!",

            "comment": "idk anything about math or physics but depending on the requirements for each you could in theory double major. As long as you could complete the requirements for both, and take your separate perspective requirements, then yes. Double majoring might not work for certain combinations of majors because there are simply too many requirements and you won\u2019t have enough time to take them all.",

It can feel a bit small at times, and it\u2019s definitely an everyone-know-everyone situation. Most of the time it\u2019s about how your personality meshes with the school and the social scene",

I don\u2019t know about physics/math major requirements, but it\u2019s pretty easy to double major in anything you want. They are pretty flexible in how you want to build your studies. Regarding social scene, IMO, parties are okay (sometimes they are a little lame) but do not expect the huge frat parties (especially considering that Clark has no Greek life). To get into a party you can just simply walk there and you\u2019ll get in lol. The school is really small. You will see someone you know around campus every time you walk by. It feels like an everyone knows each other atmosphere. Campus is nice, buildings are cool, but small size overall. There\u2019s times that you might get bored of it. About Worcester, you may find cool things but it\u2019s not the safest place. That\u2019s the one thing I don\u2019t like about Clark: the city around it. However, I\u2019m really happy with my experience so far. If you want to know more things just hit me up !",

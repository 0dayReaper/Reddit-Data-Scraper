Main South is to be avoided at all costs, no matter what Clarkies performatively say. I would not recommend living here if you don't have a car.",

There\u2019s some areas that you might want to avoid but in general the Police does a good job protecting students. There\u2019s also police buttons nearby so if something happens, you press them and campus police comes right away.",

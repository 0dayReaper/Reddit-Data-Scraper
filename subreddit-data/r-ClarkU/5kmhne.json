    "postText": "Hey Guys,\n\nI got accepted into Clark and I think it's the perfect school for me. I visited the campus today (school was obviously out of session) so my mom and brother could see it. Things were going pretty well until I noticed there was a lot of homeless people asking for money and a guy told us that there was a shooting going on nearby. I want to know how safe is Clark when school is in session and should I be concerned if I decide to attend?",

            "comment": "It's the same as any inner city school for the most part. I know people who were mugged, but that will happen in Boston or Providence just the same. Honestly, on the couple of blocks campus encompasses, it's very safe. At night it can be good to walk with a buddy/group. Nobody ever messed with me, but I'm a ~200lb guy. There's cheap housing nearby, but the surrounding neighborhoods can be sketchy. $300 a month for rent, but people break into cars occasionally. On campus is fine though. \n\nEdit: congrats on your acceptance though! Any idea what you want to study?",

Also, I have my license, do you think it's a good idea to bring a car? I was told that it's a good idea if you go into town and to get around, but will anyone break into it on campus?",

The real value is in the free masters degree (fifth year) that you are eligible for if you have a good gpa. Psych is usually how people end up at Clark, but most people end up declaring a different major by junior year. The psych program is kind of dull during undergrad, but if you stick it out until fifth year, you get a great education. \n\nI also love Worcester - best food town in the northeast. And if you have any niche interests, there's a lot going on if you know where to look. \n\nIf you end up with other questions, don't hesitate to ask!",

Like many people have said, it's a university in a city and what you described comes with the territory.  \n\nHowever, Clark is a small campus so the farthest I ever had to walk was 12-15 minutes on campus to get to a class. That was when I lived off campus.  \n\nI'd wait to bring a car until your 2nd semester or your second year. Take your first semester or two to explore Worcester. Plus Clark has tons of clubs and there is always something going on so a lot of people just exist around campus.",

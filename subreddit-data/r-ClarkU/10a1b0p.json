Per year, per collegefactual tuition increase was avg 2.9 for tuition/fees and housing 3.4%...but that was not the most recent 5 years. I'm not going to call and ask Clark their info on increases until after she visits 2 small schools this week.\n\nmy medical is HUGE though, so our EFC is WAAAAY off after that. (and unfortunately we have an UTMA which is her assets --- ugh --- we didn't start it.) But the NPC on their site had their EFT for us to be lower than the actual, and still didn't get anything.",

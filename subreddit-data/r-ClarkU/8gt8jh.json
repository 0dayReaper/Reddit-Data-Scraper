    "postText": "I decided I'd ask here rather than a general college-related sites/subreddits since I imagine things might work a little differently within different schools.\n\nWhen I was admitted to Clark, I was awarded the Traina Scholarship, which is $20k per year and practically the only reason I can even come here since neither I nor my family have the income to support my education without going into huge debt from student loans. I was an A student throughout almost all of high school, and so when I saw the requirement was that I only keep a cumulative 3.0 GPA, I thought it'd be no sweat.\n\nI'm currently finishing up my first (possibly now only?) year at Clark. My first semester went pretty well, and I finished with a GPA somewhere around 3.5 (though I only had three classes due to a scheduling error on my part). While I started the second semester fairly strong, I fell off badly due to various personal issues, including depression and gender dysphoria, becoming more prominent and fogging up my brain and basically killing all of my motivation and will to do much more than just wallow in the dark in my dorm room. Basically, I've fucked it hard.\n\nI have one class that I've been doing well in and I'm confident I have at least a B in. Another of my classes hasn't been *great*, but I'm still fairly certain I can pass as long as I find the motivation to write my entire final research paper with no prior preparation in the next 4 days.\n\nThe other two classes, I fell far enough behind that, combined with my stress attacks and personal issues, I just completely lost hope and entirely stopped showing up for the past couple of months, so I'm basically guaranteed to be failing. Mind, I'm only judging by my own perspective of how I've been doing, since I've literally been too scared to even look at my grades. I have their finals coming up that I'll certainly show up to and put in some effort since it's better than a 0, but it couldn't even save me if I 100% aced them. These two classes are required for computer science majors, but I've decided I'm not really as interested in compsci as I once thought, so I probably won't stay on that path.\n\nSo basically, is there any slim hope that I'd be able to hold onto that scholarship, or if I somehow manage to stay here despite losing it, to recover from this semester without having to take an extra year or other similarly large repercussions? Despite all my problems, I'm actually confident that over the summer I can manage to pull my shit together and come back next year stronger than ever - but I don't know how far that'll get me. And while the failed classes are required early prerequisites fo I just wish to have something to hold onto, some sort of silver lining before I have to tell my parents how hard I've royally fucked us all.",

            "comment": "Talk to the dean of students. Go all the way up the ladder and talk about how your difficulties (depression, gender dysphoria, etc.) created significant obstacles for you, but you still want to succeed. Speak to how you did well in the fall and know you can do it. Ask for help. Admit that you're scared. Admins eat that stuff up, when you open your soul. Honestly, that will get you the most action.\n\nAlso,this is why the dean of students is there, to help. Skip your advisor - you need a collaborator and consulter on your side. I'd give your advisor a heads up, because you'll need to be on good terms with them, but dean of students is your aim.\n\nAlso, go to an RA in your building, one you think is the most proactive, and ask if they can be an advocate for you to the area coordinators and RLH as a whole. You want as many people in power to know what's going on.\n\nIf you're an ALANA student, reach out to the office too, saying you're looking for reaources and help to succeed, get you back on track. Any office that \"represents\" you, essentially, reach out. \n\nIf you're prominent in clubs or student council, reach out to a member of SLP.\n\nFirst d out who is in charge of the train a scholars program and reach out with your 1) concern, 2) motivation to show it isn't representative of your performance, 3) steps you're taking / people you're working with to do better, 4) ask for advice or if you missed anything.\n\nBest of luck.",

While it was a small comfort for a while, and he assured me I'd be fine, I just don't know if I'll even be able to bring it back up above a cumulative 3.0 in just one semester, even if I somehow manage a 4.0. And if I can't do that, then I don't really know what else I can do - thus the question.",

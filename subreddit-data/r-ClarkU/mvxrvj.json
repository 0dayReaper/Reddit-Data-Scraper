    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm currently deciding between Umass Amherst and Clark (I know they're two super different schools) and need help deciding which one is a better fit. I can fortunately afford both.\n\nI would be going in as a bio major and potentially adding informatics or comp sci as a minor. How is the comp sci program at Clark? What is the classroom dynamic like? How are the professors and the research opportunities?\n\nHas anyone had experiences with their MSIT degree? I am considering it for the fifth year's master's program, which I am getting a head of myself a bit.\n\nI'm from Worcester, but how is staying at Clark? Do you ever feel it is too small or too tightknit? How is the MFGSS? Are the professors conscious about mental health? How is traveling from Clark into the rest of Worcester?\n\nWho would you recommend Clark to?",

I would recommend Clark if you want a small community with small classroom sizes and professors who know who you are.  My experience with Clark has been muddled with covid as a lot of my classes I have had to take online. and also because of this it's hard to say what it's like in terms of socialization.  I am currently involved with Bioresearch and as long as you put yourself there you should be able to find some sort of research opportunity.  I have personally dealt with mental issues and the understandingness of the professors is probably my favorite part of Clark. just last week I was able to get a needed extension on my paper. The computer science program isn't the best, but they did recently require the beaker school of technology (from beaker closing) so they might be improving on that front, I wouldn't say the program is bad either its just not what they are known for. that being said I've only taken one csci class and though it was a lot of work the professor was great.  I am not doing 5th year but I have heard as long as you have the GPA for it you should be able to get into the program.  If you are traveling from Clark to the rest of Worcester I would suggest getting a car, but public transportation/ uber does exist. due to its small size, Clark does get cliquey but it's not too small that you know everyone.",

So far I have taken csci 120 and am in math bio now. I would suggest taking biology based electives so you don't have to take discreet mathematics as a prerequisite but feel free do do so if you want a better csci foundation.",

Intro to bio and intro to chem do have large class sizes but uper level courses are small. Since it's small I feel like opertunites for research are less competitive (but I could be wrong as my sister goes to a larger school and also has research). My biggest complaint would be the Chem department, I had to withdraw from 101 freshman year (though that is probably more one me then the school) the good news is Clark's bio major  doesn't require orgo and physics like most schools and instead let you pick 2 non bio science electives (which could include csci). Another warning would be because of the size you do get less options in terms of class offerings. That being said every bio professor I have had has been great.",

UMass Amherst is big as any public college. I think they both have decent bio and computer science programs but I think Clark\u2019s focus is more into the social sciences and business. You will see more people studying things related to that (and more opportunities too). Make a list of pros and cons of each school, talk to current students, read entirely their websites on your fav programs, and contact faculty for any questions.",

The department was super small when I graduated but I did appreciate being able to get to know my professors (One of whom worked at AWS so every time something caught on fire there we'd have a fun time talking about what was probably going down) and partially because of this ended up doing a directed study on computer history. I'd say the department was fine but there's certainly some stuff that could use improvement, like updating the curriculum a bit to talk about some newer topics and tools.",

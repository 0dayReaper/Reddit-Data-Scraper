It\u2019s a large city and with any city there will be a heightened level of \u201cdanger\u201d but when people say Worcester is unsafe what they really mean is that a large part of the population are POC or low-income and that some people suffer from substance abuse. None of this equates to unsafe.",

It\u2019s not super unsafe, but there isn\u2019t that many people and more crackheads which does discourage walking around on Main st. and other long streets. The strip around Clark is fine though because there are mostly college students there and that\u2019s where parties are usually. \n\nWhat are you looking for? A place in the city or a quieter place? If you want to go out and do stuff and walk around I would suggest visiting Northeastern in Boston, Suffolk, BU, Emmanuel, and Simmons (women\u2019s college). However, those areas are really college town oriented so you\u2019re not going to meet a lot of people that are actually from Boston. Clark is smaller which is nice, and rent is a lot cheaper.",

There\u2019s sketchy stuff like there is in every city, but mostly you\u2019ll just see people smoking weed, random drug paraphernalia, and sometimes couple\u2019s domestic abuse in cars in random gas stations or something. Nothing that affects you really. It\u2019s actually a great city and I feel like there\u2019s a lot to do (before covid I guess). Lots of great hiking and nature in surrounding towns if you like that, and a variety of stuff in the city.",

    "postText": "I'm going to be moving in to Clark as a freshman in 2 weeks and I figured its time to start looking into the city. the city i live in non is known for its really awesome DIY scene- at any given moment there are tons of shows at either small bars or (most importantly) house shows- mostly punk, metal, and indie. live music is my fav part of living in my city- does anyone know if Worcester has a big music scene like this? If there are house show venues around clark? or what the art scene in worcester is like? thx!",

Its the best way to be updated about community stuff: art, music, and just people getting rid of furnaiture or needing help with CSA's. People submit their listings and it gets sent out to everyone who is subscribed.\n\nHeres the info: \n\nSend Go mailing list submissions to  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 go@lists.wstr.org  \n\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit  \n  [http://lists.wstr.org/listinfo.cgi/go-wstr.org](http://lists.wstr.org/listinfo.cgi/go-wstr.org)  \nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 go-request@lists.wstr.org  \n\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 go-owner@lists.wstr.org  \n\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific  \nthan \"Re: Contents of Go digest...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For art stuff**: \n\nWorcester Pop Up just opened up downtown and its a nice location where you can see local art. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Open mics** at ralphs diner (a bar) every monday and also at take down the wall cafe on wednesdays\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorcester has a lot of DIY stuff, you just have to look for it, be down to earth about it, and keep coming back. eventually you'll find a ton of new stuff.

They do a really good job. You should join if you want to make friends who are into the same stuff as you are.\n\nOtherwise, I've been to shows at Ralph's diner, Beatnik's has acts regularly (but tbh aren't that good but it's close to Clark), and then there's obviously the Palladium that gets bigger acts.",

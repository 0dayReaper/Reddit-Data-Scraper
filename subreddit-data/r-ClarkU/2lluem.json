That being said, there's free public wifi at Acoustic Java around the corner or just deal with it or have someone log you in with their credentials.\n\nThanks for stopping by the ITS Help Desk, have a *great* day.",

Currently the school is being upgraded to add more access points to get around this architectural bullshit.  The school currently purchases the fastest internet available, with upload speeds of 100 mbps. This is not throttled or slowed down before being made available to campus--do a speed test next time you're sitting in the AC with your laptop.  \n\nAlso, when you're in a really crowded room and everyone has their laptop and probably a smartphone connected to the wireless, it eats up a ton of bandwidth. Many devices also will connect to overcrowded access points instead of connecting to ones that are less crowded.  This is controlled entirely by the device, and there is literally nothing that ITS can do to make that stop. 98% of the time, it's actually the devices that are shit, not the wireless. \n\n",

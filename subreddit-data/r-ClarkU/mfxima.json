    "postText": "Hi, Im an admitted student at clark, its a bit on the expensive side of all the schools I\u2019ve been accepted to. Im just wondering if its worth going with the hefty price tag. Also Im wondering if the science program would be strong enough to get me into chiropractic school. Another thing im worried about is employment on and off campus and how accessible it is. How are the intramurals (love ping pong) and orchestras? And are the dorms and food alright? Are the professors available a lot of office hours and are the classes big or small? I have no knowledge of this school and its worth, sorry if this is a lot of questions, just really worried right now",

            "comment": "hi, stem student here. the thing is the name of the undergrad institution you attend isn\u2019t as important as what you do with your time in undergrad. I think I did well in stem at Clark (well enough to get into 3 top 10 masters programs in my field) but that\u2019s more about my resume if anything. if you can save money and go to a state school, I would. however, clark being a smaller school, it was really easy for me to get involved in extracurriculars like jobs and research, etc. The only big classes I ever had were the intros (intro bio + chem).",

            "comment": "I am a biology major at Clark and the biology program is pretty good. I am not sure how it is in terms of employment after college and getting into chiropractic school but I do know quite a few premed students. I enjoy the fact that the vast majority of my classes are small (the only big ones are intro to chem and intro to biology). All of the biology professors I have been really nice and are not only available for office hours but if you are unable to make the office hours will find time to meet with you. Clark also has the benefit of being a research institution so if you were interested in research that is something you would easily be able to do. food is meh, it's Sodexo so it's not great, but it's edible. employment off-campus is pretty accessible as most upperclassmen are able to receive parking if they live on campus  (though most including me chose to live in a nearby off-campus apartment) dorms are alright pretty standard to most colleges dorms. my roommate is in band and does pit for the musicals and she really enjoys it. not sure about ping pong (do we even have a team? idk possibly?)",

Is the food really as terrible as it is? How's Worcester? Do you get to see the city much? Does Clark do much for the community? Was Clark your first choice? Why did you decide to go to Clark?\n\nTHANKS :]",

However, we don't technically go to the Main Dunkin, we do go to the Park one, though. \n\nPersonally, I found in my own college search in my senior year that many college campuses have crime problems. At least at Clark, I've found the crime to be overhyped. Actual muggings are rare (but well publicized) and really only happen if you're walking off campus at 4 in the morning. If you ever have that urge, please take Escort. We're open until 4am for this reason. Clark's campus proper has it's own police force and I can really only think of one incident that's happened on the main campus. Dude got caught almost instantly.",

            "comment": "Well the first thing, is that the subreddit isn't very active.\n\nThe main thing to know is that Clark is a fairly small school--with the pros and cons that come with it. The cafe food is pretty decent, although I'm off the meal plan. You have to stay on a meal plan until you are a junior like I am. Worcester is a quaint city. A fairly common way to describe it is \"a small town masquerading as a big city\". There's not much of a night life, but there are a few cheap bars and a bunch of off campus parties. \n\n\nHow much of the city you get to see is up to you. Worcester's Main South is fairly sketchy, so keep that in mind. Personally, my first few weeks as a Clark freshman, I wandered around the streets trying to find cool shit. Most of what you'll ever need is within easy walking distance. We also have an Escort Service that will drive you anywhere within a very short distance of campus. I work for Escort, and we don't have a very large radius, but it does include a wide variety of shops and restaurants. \n\nCVS, Price Chopper, and Big Y will be staples for general groceries and general goods. For niche foods there is Santiagos (Hispanic) and Ha-tien (Asian). I think there is a health food store somewhere as well. For coffee there is Dunkin Donuts, Dippin Donuts, and Boston Donuts. I would like to point out that Boston Donuts has a crapload of awesome flavors. I like Reese's flavor, but be prepared for super sweetness.\n\nClark does quite a bit for the local community. It does a lot of renovating and even [provides those with top grades in the local high school free rides.](http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030527/NEWS01/305279967&amp;cid=sitesearch&amp;template=printart) Clark was my first choice, because I felt I would be bored in most of the non-urban schools I applied to. Also, Clark offered me more scholarship money. \n\nHave you any thoughts on your major or field of interest? ",

I've heard some negative reviews of it but that could have been old reviews.\n\n&gt;It does a lot of renovating and even provides those with top grades in the local high school free rides.\n\nThat's super cool! And yeah, if anything, it seems Clark is very good on it's scholarship offering.\n\nWhat's your major? Have you had a favorite class? And this PLS thing... PC has something like it and everyone despises it from what I gathered on the tours.... Is the PLS just as annoying?\n",

                            "comment": "We're famous for our Psychology department. We also have a statue of Freud which is a magnet for a variety of hijinks. If you're interested in Peace Studies, you should read [Professor Akcam's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taner_Ak%C3%A7am) wikipedia page. I had him for a history of the Middle East class. He's this little Turkish fellow who is considered one of the world's leading authorities on the Armenian genocide. Oh, and he's also an escaped convict. He was arrested for political dissidence and for challenging the Turkish denial of the Armenian genocide. Clark is lucky to have him.\n\nMy only problem with the cafe is that I got bored of the food after two years. That might account for many of the reviews. Are you planning on visiting? It might be a good idea to try it if you do.\n\nI'm a Geography major with an Asian Studies minor, which is the other thing Clark is famous for other than Psychology. Geography combines human geography, urban geography, physicial geography, and GIS all into one major. I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in for quite a while so the PLS courses helped me figure it out. Also, as irritating as they are, the well-rounded courseload is pretty much the essence of a liberal arts education.\n\nMy favorite class was Professor Ropp's class on Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. Chinese religions are simply nothing like the religions in the West. Professor Ropp is also yet another stone cold bad ass masquerading as a little old man. There's this one story that he tells about his trip to China right around the time when Chairman Mao died. As you can imagine, the political turmoil was heavy with riots in the streets and political cartoon graffiti everywhere. He was strictly \"advised\" to remain within his hotel and not to take any pictures. Well... he did it anyways. He would sneak out early in the morning to take pictures of some of the political cartoons. One day, he was caught by a Chinese official, who asked him what he was doing. Ropp looked right at the official and stated in all honesty that he was actually taking pictures. He then went on to explain to the official that he was a professor of Chinese history and that he had wanted to record some of it. The official was so impressed by his honesty that he just told him to \"not take any more\". Ropp showed us the pictures in class. There's even a Clark U meme about it.\n\nUnfortunately, Ropp goes through cycles of retirement and coming out of retirement. He keeps threatening to retire for real, but he keeps coming back. This semester, he's retired and I don't know if he'll come back.",

            "comment": "a bit late, but here's my take. I graduated in May 2012 with a double major in poli sci and philosophy, a minor in business management, and a concentration in law &amp; society. currently attending graduate school in NYC.\n\nMy favorite thing about Clark was definitely the people. Clark is the type of school where you can be whoever the fuck you want to be without having to worry too much about the social consequences. Yeah, cliques exist to a certain extent, but whoever the fuck you are, and however 'strange' your interests might be compared to main-stream society, you will find a bunch of misfits to get along with. I've also noticed that Clarkies are genuinely friendly people (generally speaking). I've gone to a lot of events with kids from other schools, and have spoken with a lot of my friends who transferred out, and the consensus seems to be that Clark has a pretty friendly student population.\n\nLeast favorite: I'm not alone when I say that going to school in Worcester wasn't a very pleasant experience. My opinion may be overly skewed since I've spent a lot of time in Boston, Seoul, Manila, and New York City. There's just not that much to do off-campus and there is relatively little engagement with any of the other Worcester schools.\n\nFood: Food definitely wasn't something to write home about, but it wasn't that bad either. You'll live. From what I've heard, things have improved significantly since I graduated in 2012, so perhaps the others are able to lend a better perspective. That being said, there are some great off-campus dining options (VIETNAMESE FOOD) that you should take advantage of.\n\nWorcester: like I said, it stinks. Sorry worcesterites, just my $0.02.\n\nCity: It depends how much you like to explore. I liked exploring the city a bit, but many other people I knew almost never stepped off-campus. With the bus system, it's fairly easy to get around the city. Unless you take the initiative, though, you won't see much of it.\n\nClark &amp; the community: Yes. The partnership with University Park has resulted in some spectacular results. There's the issue regarding the University buying up land without concern for the impacts that it might have on the community, so there's that side of the issue too.\n\nFirst choice: Clark was not my first choice. In hindsight, I'm extremely glad that I chose it. The combination of a research institution and a liberal arts experience really allows you to have a good slice of both worlds. Many of my friends at larger institutions had an extraordinarily difficult time trying to get face time with professors. This is the type of problem that you'll rarely encounter at Clark (for the most part). If you're interested in law school, even a little bit, GO SEE PROFESSOR MARK MILLER. Especially if you're considering pursuing political science as a major. He is extremely helpful, both as an instructor and as a mentor. GO SEE HIM ON YOUR FIRST DAY. I'm pursuing graduate studies at a fairly competitive school in NYC, and I can say that my studies adequately prepared me to compete with extremely bright students.\n\nWhy I chose Clark: Look at the answer above. Research + liberal arts experience = win.",

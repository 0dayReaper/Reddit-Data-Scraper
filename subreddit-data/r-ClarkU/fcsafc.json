I was accepted into the International Development Program in the fall and looking at the IDCE house since I'm transitioning from west coast to east coast and know nothing. Would love any feedback! I'm torn between doing that or looking for an apartment off campus.",

            "comment": "I'm an undergraduate upperclassmen and I don't know what the pricing for graduate housing is like but living off-campus is insanely expensive for kind of shitty accomodations. I'm living in a four bedroom with three people, and that's 475 in rent, 15 for electric, 15 for wifi, and sometimes almost 60 for gas in the cold months. It's nice not dealing with housing closing over breaks, residential rules, and fire alarms from nearby dummies burning popcorn, but sometimes I wish I stayed on campus just because it's sooo expensive. That being said, lmk if you're interested in a room; we have a free lmao",

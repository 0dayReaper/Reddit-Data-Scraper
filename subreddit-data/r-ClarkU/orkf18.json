    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman at Clark. I have federal work-study, and from my understanding, the on-campus jobs are extremely competitive. Any advice on applying? And your experience? Also, I'm unfamiliar with handshake, and for the cover letters, do they need to be approved in order for me to apply for a job? I wish I got more information on the work-study at Clark.",

            "comment": "Throughout my time at Clark I held a couple of on-campus jobs. Although they were all non-work study, I imagine the same advice applies for work-study job.\n\nMy advice is this: Get to know people. Most jobs people get are through friends or professors.* Make sure you get to know your fellow freshmen, and if you make friends with some upperclassmen, even better (although of course I'm not saying you make friends solely for the purpose of getting a job on campus).\n\nMake sure your professors know about you as well, and know that you're driven and hard working (or at least think you are).\n\nGood luck!\n\n*Even though there usually is a formal application process, knowing people will ensure somebody looks at your resume, they might give you interview tips etc.",

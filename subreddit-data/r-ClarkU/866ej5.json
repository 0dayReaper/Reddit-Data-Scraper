I know too many people who did this and then broke up and had to move out for me to say it\u2019s even remotely a good idea. You don\u2019t have to try to convince yourself that you\u2019re older than you are by \u201cmoving in together\u201d as college freshmen.\n\n I\u2019m not saying that you and her don\u2019t have very real feelings for each other that should be respected by everyone including older people, but what I am saying is that like...\n\nremember how when you were 12/13/14 years old EVERYTHING changed? Everything about how you lived, talked with people, etc. just became different and all the rules changed and you had a new relationship to your life? That happens again 18-22. It\u2019s normal, but you and her will suddenly change and might change in different directions.",

I don't know if you can specifically request to live with someone as a first-year, so I would check with RLH specifically about that. Somewhere like Johnson-Sanford Hall would be a better bet, because it isn't gender-separated. Or, at least, it wasn't a couple of years ago.\n\nIf first-year, you can't live together, you absolutely can the years after that.",

    "postText": "Hey all!\nSo I recently got into Clark\u2019s MA English program. I\u2019m still waiting to hear from a few schools, but it\u2019s looking like Clark might be my best bet, so I have a few questions:\n1. Does anyone know anything about the program or department/what do they think?\n2. What is living in Worcester like? I\u2019m currently in Burlington at UVM, and I love the nature and the music and art scene up here.\n3. Is it easy to make friends? I have a pretty solid group up here and it\u2019s making me nervous to leave. My boyfriend and I are also going to *try* to do the long distance, will having a boyfriend effect my social life at all?\n\nThank you!",

I only took one class in the department as an undergrad, but I really enjoyed the professor and the class (can't remember the Prof's name but the class was creative writing poetry). It's typical at Clark to have very small classes (especially upper division) which is great for discussions and in my case, sharing and getting feedback on creative writing. You also get really individualized attention from Professors, and lots of them will go above and beyond for their students. It's a liberal arts school and they actively try for an interdisciplinary perspective which is something that I found most compelling. Betsy Huang had this course that was about the intersection of sci fi literature and sociology that I always wanted to take. I'm not sure what you are looking to do with an MA in English, though, so I can't really direct you beyond saying that it would be in your best interest to seek out one or two faculty members that you'd like to work with, because I imagine that will determine much of your experience.\n2. I really like Worcester, but I might be in the minority. There's a good amount of nature within driving distance so you'll need a car to take advantage. And of course weather permitting. The music scene is good, but the art scene is mediocre, and some of the best stuff in Worcester is on campus or at a nearby school. Worcester is close enough to Boston so that you could go and get something really amazing every weekend if you wanted.\n3. People at Clark are extraordinarily friendly. The grad students I knew, that hadn't gone to Clark for undergrad, were quite close with the other grad students in their departments and some of the most dedicated Jr's and Senior's as well.",

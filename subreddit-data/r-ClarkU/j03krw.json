If you're going down the stairs labelled \"down only\" and go to the left, walk through the large basement common area (with all the couches and chairs) and the laundry room is immediately to your right in a small room. If you go down the \"up only\" stairs lol, take a right and then an immediate left. It's a small and awkward room, but it's absolutely not on the fourth floor.",

Whose ranking?\n\nBeing 103 overall in the US would be a badge of distinction; being 103 in terms of basketball programs would be less impressive.\n\nEdit: sorry about the bold, I'd included a pound sign to begin the first line.  I went to Clark for my undergrad, with pretty strong financial aid in terms of grants.  Not thrilled that my major was hacked to the bone during the last year or two, but Dr. Miller did get his law class a behind the scenes tour of the Supreme Court, due to his connections.  That was amazing.",

If you\u2019re interesting in the school, I recommend talking to some current or past students! They\u2019re going to be able to give you the best sense of what Clark is like. (Starting with contacting admissions is also never a bad place to start)",

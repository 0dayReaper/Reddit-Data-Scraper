I am not into college parties hence my age but I wanna see how the nightlife and dating life is.  Of course, I am a sociology major and also want to know how the department is.  Great teachers? ",

Dr. Jennifer Brandt is my favorite. \n\nThe school has really good resources. \n\nMost students commute nearby so I\u2019m not sure about social life but the clubs would be the best way to be fully emerged in the social scene. But everyone here is friendly. Food choices aren\u2019t the best. ",

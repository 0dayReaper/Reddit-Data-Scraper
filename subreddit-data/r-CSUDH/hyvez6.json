    "postText": "Hey everyone, can someone help me figure this out? \n\n\nI recently got my Cal Grant award approved, and it showed up in my account along with the Pell Grant. But the CSU Grant disappeared. That is to say, I had the Pell and CSU Grants before, and now I only have the Cal and Pell Grants. Anyone know a reason why the CSU Grant would have been taken off of my account? Nothing that I can think of would disqualify me. \n\n\nI already emailed financial aid services. Hopefully, I can figure this out.",

Usually its only for your first year if you get CAL GRANT B which for the first year pays only student fees, and the consecutive years full tuition. The CSU GRANT just covers the first year.",

    "postText": "Hello\n\nI volunteer for the Los Angeles Warmline and wanted to pass on the information about the LA Warmline.\n\nThe number is **(855) 952-9276** .\n\nThe line is open every night, overnight from 10 PM-6 AM - including holidays. It is designed to be a supplemental resource to any therapy/counseling you may or may not have. If you ever need a few minutes to talk to someone about experiencing loneliness, financial problems, school stress, relationship problems, substance abuse issues, or any difficulties you may face, feel free to call.\n\nThe line is staffed by peers in the mental health community. Our peers are either involved in the mental health community, have a diagnosis themselves, or have family members who are mental health consumers.\n\nThis service is especially intended for anyone living in Los Angeles County, but we now actually take calls from all over the country!\n\nLet them know you heard about it on Reddit!",

Be sure to check them out at www.kdhr.net. They also offer all of their shows on iTunes, I found them at 'KDHR.'\n\nAwesome stuff!",

One of the saddest moments in our school's history, other than the rotting dead elephant incident, was when they sold the FM frequency of our university's radio station. Now it is only online. But still a great part of what CSUDH offers. Who are your favorite DJs?",

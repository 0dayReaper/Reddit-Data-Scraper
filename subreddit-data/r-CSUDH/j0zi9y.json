Socialism is an ideology that does cater to individual rights, but works on a macro scale to solve inefficiencies that otherwise harm individuals.\n\nIf you ever want more information, you\u2019re more than welcome to come to a club event when campus reopens. Many friends of mine, including myself, have made the transition from conservatism, libertarianism, and more to branches of socialism over the years, after they\u2019ve received more education on the subject and deprogrammed themselves from the capitalist cult.",

We are not glorifying China or Cuba, but we also see some existential threats to humanity springing forth from a combination of automation, myopic democracies, third-world industrialization, and capitalism. \n\nWe are interested in modifying democratic centralism, the system of government that China, Cuba, and Vietnam run on, to be held accountable by constituents and for decision-makers to have more in common with their constituents, with the backers of these representatives living through largely the same problems the rest of the population does. We also would have various incentive schemes, like bonuses and social credit, to encourage efficiency.\n\nWe\u2019d first introduce technocracy through tripartite industrial congresses, where union leaders elected from both managerial unions and technician unions, as well as consumer union leaders, would come together to deliberate on proposals for legislation in their respective industry. Once they had crafted their legislation, the draft would be sent to the party members appointed to oversee that industry\u2019s regulations and surplus allocations (surplus allocations requires a whole lot more to explain). \n\nThe party members on these legislation committees would have a direct stake in representing the totality of the state, as they\u2019d be automatically replaced if their approval ratings dropped too low within party ranks, and would receive a percentage of the total industry\u2019s increases in revenues, multiplied by the average satisfaction ratings of consumers in those industries and CPI for that industry would subtract from the final sum, incentivizing party members to increase gross industrial production, without triggering inflation, while keeping consumers happy. \n\nExample: (x being whatever percentage deemed appropriate for incentive pay) \n\n{(total revenue growth / x) \u2022 (average satisfaction rating) - (CPI)}\n\nSo we\u2019d have employee, managerial, and consumer representation in legislation, and the party committees would be directly incentivized to best accommodate both their industry\u2019s desires, as well as the rest of totality. This kind of thinking, of balancing industrial needs with societal needs and creating incentive and enforcement mechanisms to ensure officials follow these guidelines, isn\u2019t even seen in the United States or any other direct democracy or representational republic today. \n\nParty members themselves would have to pass a variety of Confucian-scholar tests, in order to verify that they both agreed with the ideology\u2019s structure, agreed with the values, and could fairly represent the people. Party members themselves would have to pass increasingly harder tests, as seniority led to automatic promotions, in order to have a role in the voting and implementation process and this would continually weed out older, dimmer members of the party in favor of younger, more ambitious people who shared largely the same lifestyle as the people out of which they were selected. This way of trimming the selectorate would naturally make the party more responsive to the youth, and thus always reinventing itself to cater to modern conditions.\n\nParty members would be eligible for elections to political positions after attaining certain positions in the surplus state and passing enough tests. Then through internal elections, largely determined by a middle class of lower party members, the most qualified of these eligible candidates would be chosen. Should their approval rate fall below 75%, then there\u2019d be a re-election. All in all, you\u2019d have smart, qualified, and educated people choosing objectively smarter and more experienced people to lead them, all while remaining grounded in the affairs of the society around them. There\u2019d be ivory towers, to enable higher thought and more articulate discussions, but their leaders wouldn\u2019t become detached from reality so much as just have a bird\u2019s eye view and more incentives to perform well.\n\nThe highest members of the party would be the smartest and most experienced leaders in the nation, who had passed dozens if not hundreds of these examinations, and by extension, our leadership would be based purely on merit. \n\nI can explain more, but truthfully, I\u2019d rather not exasperate you unless you\u2019re interested in learning more.",

This would ensure the enforcement of laws both within and outside the party, as the various law enforcement departments acted more autonomously and technocratically, outside the direct hierarchy of the party and as almost equals in an authority sense.",

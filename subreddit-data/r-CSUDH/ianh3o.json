There\u2019s a Facebook group where you can join (this page is a ghost town).\n\nHere\u2019s the link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/142456425803960/?ref=share\n\nBut to answer your question, they started applying loans/grants to students accounts yesterday (8/14). From what I heard, as well as the email I got, they send refunds once a week and 99% of the time it\u2019s on Wednesday\u2019s. So if you check your account activity on your student center, and you see it\u2019s been applied towards the money you owe, then you should be getting a refund for the remainder (if any) very soon. \n\nHope this helps.",

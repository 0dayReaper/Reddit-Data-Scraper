I'm kinda taking the position that if there are any deficiencies they'll reject me and tell me what I need to take. Otherwise, upon admission I'll take the rest of the pre-clinical classes into addition to any remaining courses.",

Other than that I think that you're good. My issue is that I have a C in ochem B and that brings my gpa under the threshhold of it did count as a core class.",

If you make it past that then it goes to Ms. Harris who will then look at your science classes and admit you based on that. She said that its based on all your science classes (biochem, ect.) \n\nEdit: Call her after 4:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays",

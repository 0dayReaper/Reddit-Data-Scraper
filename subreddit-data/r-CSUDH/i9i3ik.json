    "postText": "Hello everyone! I have some questions about CLS requirements and CLS program at CSUDH. I hope someone here can answer some of my questions :)\n\n1. Is there a course equivalence for pre-CLS requirements for CSUDH's  CLS program? or do most of the classes generally have to be taken at  CSUDH?  \n 2. Is it true CSUDH pre-CLS classes are really impacted? or only for certain classes? which classes?  \n 3. If you taken a class without a lab somewhere else, but CSUDH required the lab if  that specific class was taken at CSUDH. Would you have to retake that class at CSUDH because  there is no course equivalence?  \n 4. Who would you suggest contacting for more information for CSUDH CLS  program? I've seen a list of faculty and many mention Harris, but she's  pretty difficult to get in contact with.\n\n5. Once you're in the actual clinical year (not doing the pre-clinical classes), what do you do? just rotations at specific clinical sites to get your experience then do the exam? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for looking at my questions!",

You will be put on a waitlist for those classes and the dept. of biology will give you add codes when the spots become available. Wait time is at least a year.\n\n1.2. Yeah, you can take classes at CSUDH no problem.\n\n1.3. You can contact Dr. Nasr.\n\n2. During the clinical year, you will be still doing classes and labs and rotations on site. After one year, you do the exam and get your license.",

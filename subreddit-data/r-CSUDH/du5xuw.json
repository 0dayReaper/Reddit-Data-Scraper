Is it easy to switch from one csu to another with no problems I don't really get it , thanks.",

This semester is my first semester at CSUDH, i transferred from a community college in Long Beach, and the transition has been great. I\u2019ll put it like this, they give you every single resource you may need, from academic, to even all the health/mental health resources we have available here. There\u2019s no excuse for someone to fail unless they don\u2019t try. I\u2019m excited for you!",

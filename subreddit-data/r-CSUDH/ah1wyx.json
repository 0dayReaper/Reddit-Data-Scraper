The level at which they expect you to perform at is comparable to high ranking universities nearby. Make the best out of it, study your ass off and you\u2019ll do great. Source: currently a PhD student at the top program in the world for my field and I am well prepared for most of my classes. \n\nNot sure what classes the other poster took, but not a high school environment, at least not the one I went to ",

Not many people want to do research at CSUDH so there aren\u2019t many active labs. Biochem puts you in the best spot for one though. I would reach out to the LSAMP program or MARC USTAR program for research opportunities. If you\u2019re interested in biomedical related research, there are plenty at the harbor UCLA labs nearby, they have partnerships with CSUDH. ",

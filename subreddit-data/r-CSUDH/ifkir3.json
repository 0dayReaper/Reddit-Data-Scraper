    "postText": "   Hello, I am currently a sophomore in CSULB wanting to pursue a career in Health. I am aware about the CLS major in CSUDH and wanted to learn more. I tried googling and researching about it but I couldn\u2019t find a lot. From what I am aware of, you are supposed to be enrolled in 2 semesters at DH, then take the needed classes (I hear it takes about 1-2 years because of how full the classes can get). Then go through the interview for a 1 year internship. Altogether taking up to 3 years in total.\nI am curious if the major itself is impacted and what preparations I should take. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Why need to be enrolled in two semesters and then take classes?\n\nAfter transfer, it will take you about 3 years to graduate. Then one more year of internship.\n\nClasses are impacted and you will be placed on a waitlist for a couple of semesters.\n\nIt's not easy. A lot of chemistry, biology, stats, and clinical courses (hematology, urinalysis, virology, parasitology, immunology, etc).",

            "comment": "As a second year CLS major, I will explain as much to the best of ability based on experience and testaments from others further in the program.\n\nThe major has its main focuses on chemistry, biology and the clinical courses. If you don't like chemistry or are not as proficient in your skills needed for chemistry, then chances are you won't have the best time in those classes. Biology content was not that bad but some professors are better than others, as always. The clinical courses I can't really elaborate on (yet) but I heard, and I may or may not be wrong, are mainly taught by two professors and I don't recall their ratings.\n\nThere is an internship that takes one year and AFAIK, you're more likely to get it if you're focusing in Medical Technology as they accept more than Cytotechnology.\n\nFor most people, if you go into the program as a freshman and assuming you pass all your classes, the time it takes for you to graduate (before you start your internship) takes four and a half years and maybe five if you fail a class. If you took the chemistry placement exam and get into your courses, then it should take your four years, assuming you don't fail. The earlier chemistry and biology classes are bottlenecked from what my friends told me and I was lucky to get into these.  \n\n\nI'm not confident that I gave you the information you were hoping for, so if you have any questions, feel free to PM me!",

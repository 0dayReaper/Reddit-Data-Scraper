As for parking passes, the Chief of Campus Police sent out an email on Wednesday saying that there will be a pro-rated refund based on the permit type.\n\nStudent Vehicle/Car Permit: $78\n\nStudent Motorcycle Permit: $20\n\nUnit 11 Student TA's: $33\n\nThis refund will come in the form of a check sent to the address they have on file for each student or a direct deposit if the student has DD set up. They strongly recommend that all students set up direct deposit, though.\n\nI hope that clears up any concerns you have.",

Again, their preferred method is direct deposit, but if you don't have that set up (like myself), they'll mail you a check to the address they have on file.\n\nIf you, or someone you know, wants to sign up for direct deposit, you can go [here](https://www.csudh.edu/Assets/csudh-sites/accounting-services/docs/direct-deposit-enrollment-guide.pdf) to learn how to sign up or update your current info.\n\nI would say that if you don't get the money by mid- to late-April, give them a call at (310) 243-3639.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been thinking A LOT about pursuing a criminal justice major and after a lot of searching I found CSUDH to be a pretty affordable school for it. \n\nI haven\u2019t been to school in maybe three-ish years; I last attended Valley College and my GPA was not the best. I graduated high school in 2011 so I don\u2019t have and SAT or ACT scores. If I were to apply, would it be as a freshman or transfer?\n\nIf any of you guys out there have graduated or are currently studying CJ, please give me all the info you have. Thank you!",

    "postText": "Is anyone enrolled in this program or has completed it?  I have narrowed down my master's degree choice to online quality control orientated degrees for the goal of becoming a certified quality engineer (CQE).  I have found this degree and another at Southern Illinois University, which is an MS in Quality Engineering and Management.  Anyways, for anyone that has completed the MSQA, have you found the degree to be useful? Or has anyone else compared these two degrees and come to a decision on it?  I know, that is a super specific question. What I have noticed on linkedin is that most people that have it have already been in the quality control field, while the SIU seems to have been some peoples ticket into the field.  As for the courses, the MSQA is more QA specific while the MSQEM is more broad, like Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma Black Belt classes.  I have a pretty focused BS (Nuclear Engineering Technology), so do you think a more focused (MSQA) or a more broad (MSQEM) degree would better complement my BS?  Also, I plan on moving back to Cali in the next few years, so I would think that would give an edge to CSUDH.",

I didn't really see myself going down the quality engineering path anymore, but was so invested already that I just finished it.  So it will probably only serve me from the management side of things.  That being said, there were some valuable lessons learned completing the degree that I feel have made me better at planning and problem solving.  I may have been better off getting something like a Masters of Engineering Management though.  If you are in the quality field already then it will serve you much better than it did for me.",

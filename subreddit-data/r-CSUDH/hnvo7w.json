I wanted to take the GWAR test to check of the upper division English requirement, whether it\u2019s a good idea to take my capstones those semester and stay exclusively online or if going to campus will make sense still, and I wanted more information about planning a couple extra classes in my last semester that are apart of a major adjacent to mine (I\u2019m FTV Production, but I am interested in taking a couple classes that apart of the FTV Media major).",

My girlfriend goes to Long Beach and that\u2019s what she has been calling them. So I suppose that\u2019s what I meant. Basically, my first semester can be either primarily major-related classes, or primarily the humanities and the history requirement. I\u2019d just hate for another shut down to derail some important classes.",

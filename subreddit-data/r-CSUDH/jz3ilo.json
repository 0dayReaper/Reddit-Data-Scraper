    "postText": "Hello!\nI am a psychology major student from Cal State Dominguez Hills and I am looking for 10 participants who are willing to help me in a replication project for my Cognitive Psychology class. The intended purpose of the research is to obtain information on how well memory functions in regards to face recognition. Participants will meet with me through a zoom call and will be shown a PowerPoint. Then they will be asked a set of questions. The survey and PowerPoint should take no more than 30 minutes. If you are interested please contact me to my email at nayellysolis7@gmail.com or send me a message through any of my social media platforms. If I may ask a small favor and forward this message to anyone that might be interested in participating. Thank you so much!",

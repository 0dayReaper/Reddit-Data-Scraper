CONGRATULATIONS AND WELCOME. \n\nI majored in public administration so I can't help you with class information, but I can say keep an eye out for when scholarships open (I think it was in April?). They never advertise it and you can get quite a bit of money if you apply. \n\nAnother tip: always check the library first for your text books. At least for my major, the library usually had a hard copy or a digital copy to check out for the semester. I ended up saving TONS of money doing that. \n\nGood luck!",

For me, the requirement to transfer here was easier. I can't say much about the campus, but from what I've heard from friends. There is a lot more to do at CPP than DH.\nA lot of the students here are working or older, so you might find that the professors can be a bit more forgiving with material/deadlines. Most of my lecturers have always talked about how they aren't strict on deadlines because they've had students who work graveyards and will accommodate. \nWhatever you choose, if you're willing to take the debt/can afford to I would dorm to make friends and connections.",

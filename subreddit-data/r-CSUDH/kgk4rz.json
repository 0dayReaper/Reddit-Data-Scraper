            "comment": "REC 100 with Mary Cappel. There is a required textbook that you have to buy from the bookstore but the class is really easy from what I remember. Most of it was weekly tests on the chapters.\n\nIf you don't need to take an area E course and still need to finish some lower area D GEs I would have recommended Human Geography GEO 100 with Menary. GEO 100 looks pretty full right now though.\n\nDepending on what you plan to go into with your science education, you could also try IDS 210 Environmental Studies with Professor Hall. I've taken her for a few courses. Most work is planned and announced ahead of time and you have to do 5 discussion boards and some essays (no more than 3 pages) usually. \n\nIf you don't like these options the only other thing I can think of is to think of any non-science subject you might be vaguely interested in, use the Class Search to find random classes and then go to RateMyProfessors to help you choose one. Not always accurate but sometimes the critical reviews can be helpful.",

    "postText": "Hi. During my junior/ 3rd year of high school, I did concurrent enrollment and took an introductory film class at El Camino, to help my GPA for college applications and because I thought it would be interesting. Did well in the class, it was kind of an easy A class. I saw that CSUDH also offered an introductory film class that can be taken to satisfy a transcript requirement, so I figured I should take it since I took one during high school before at El Camino and got a good grade. Is COM130 at CSUDH easy? Can anyone share their experience? I'm worried I might be underestimating it and it kicks my ass. Who teaches COM130?",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm a community college student. I'm fluent in two languages other than English, but I am not a native English speaker. I love teaching and want to become an ESL teacher. I was thinking to transfer to the California state university Northridge, the teacher preparation program for elementary school teachers. Than to enroll after the BA to a master in Esl education and earn the Esl authorization. However, I changed my mind after I discovered that CSUDH offers a \"Bachelor of Arts in English: English Education Option, Teaching English as a Second Language Extended Studies\". What do you think would be the best path to become an ESL Teacher? Which road would be less time consuming and would give me a stronger preparation ? Finally, do you think I could become a good ESL teacher even if I'm note a native speaker?\n\nThank you",

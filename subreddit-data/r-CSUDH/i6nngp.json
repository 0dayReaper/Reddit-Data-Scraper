You have to be just as passionate though, or you might get overwhelmed, lol. Dr. Namala is a total sweetie pie, and Alvarez is fun, so I\u2019d make it a priority to get them when you do your upper divisions GEs (you might want to stay away from Fawver and Murillo if you\u2019re non history though. they\u2019re great professors, but *very* intense- Fawver has been known to make at least 1 freshmen cry per semester). If you do become a history major though, you\u2019ll get to work with the department heads, dr.s Monty and Talamante, who are very supportive- soviet Russia and revolutionary France was never so cool! You can also steal into the archives to get hands on experience with Dr. Williams, where you actually get to work with documents.\n\nA lot of people go to Dominguez for education related majors (ie  elementary education, special education, single subject, etc). All the subjects are pretty decent since they know future educators *will* be in the class. Many majors have a special education track as well. \n\nThe arts and entertainment related majors are pretty decent too. We\u2019ve had many graduates go on to work in the more technical side of the industry.\n\nSorry for rambling, but I hope you\u2019ve gotten a good picture of everything",

They also have one of the best student clubs on Campus as well. The club is very friendly to people who aren't even a math major as well. All the professors on campus are the nicest people in the world.",

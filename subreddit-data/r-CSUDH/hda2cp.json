From what I've heard from other students and ratemyprof he doesn't finish the syllabus. I have a problem with how he teaches the class. One student had questioned the ethics of certain people and instead of exploring the idea of possibilities. Suchenek shot down the student instead of looking around the idea of ethics. To me that makes the class ridiculous.",

Courses taught by the staff were mostly based on the course books so as long as you read those you were good. These courses were not very useful. Course taught by guest lecturers were difficult and we're good learning experiences however. If you are already a SWE I would say that all you are really going to get from the program is a credential.",

I'm still very junior, so I'm sure most classes will make me better and maybe I can try some of the specialties (like Machine Learning, data science, software engineering etc...) to see what I like.\n\nI also snap applied to schools a few months back because I wasn't sure I'd get a job when I got out of the military, but now that I have a position, I'm not as pressured to go to school immediately. An MA is definitely one of my goals as down the line I'd love to be a professor and/or write some tech books. I'll probably want to transfer to UCSD, but I still want to take some classes to get back into an academic mindset/GI bill pays a housing stipend, so extra cash never hurts. Thanks again for the feedback!",

            "comment": "From the professors and course I've taken I made a list:\n\nSuchenek (Computers and Society): terrible but easy to pass class all tests answers are available online and you don't even got to pay attention in class. I got an A- and bullshitted the whole class. Passed it on my first year.\n\nBlankenship (Intro to Java 1): he's cool very forgiving about work and is easy to pass. He does deviate a bit from the syllabus and honestly if you've taken java before then you're good. \n\nRosenthal (Intro to Java 2): too much work but you actually learn things. There are assignments due pretty much every day. The tests are mostly multiple choice but the coding problems may take a while. He is very thorough with instructions though so you should be fine with knowing what to do. \n\nMcCullough (Intro to Assembly): he understands if you don't understand the material. Don't miss a quiz/test because he will not let you take it. Also clicker is a requirement for that class\n\nLiudong Zuo (Discrete Structures): you don't really have to take his course if you take the math equivalent. I recommend taking MAT 271 before his CSC 281 class because then like 70% of the class will be stuff you already know. WARNING: his accent may be a bit to strong and i don't recommend sitting at the back of the class because you might not be able to hear him.\n\nKhani Payman: He maybe a bit to strict and may sometimes be cold. He made his students take a quiz on the first day to see wether or not they should drop the course. He does give assignments and he is rather loud so there is no way you can't here him. He is very strict about cheating as 3 students were caught plagiarizing.\n\nLeon Juan: He is pretty chill. He is actually a graduate student and he mostly does labs and lectures. He is very relaxed about turning in homework and his labs. He is willing to give extensions to students who need it. He also likes helping students who are falling behind and prioritizes the students understanding.\n\nThat's about all the professors I've taken courses with.",

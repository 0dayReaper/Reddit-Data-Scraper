    "postText": "Hey guys, I really need opinions, experiences, or simply advice on what to choose. I was going to decide on CSUDH MSW program but I got accepted into CSULB as well for the MSW. I just graduated with my BA from CSUDH so it was easy for me to just go back. Has anyone had to weigh this option? Has anyone done the MSW program at CSUDH? Or CSULB? Im a first gen, I don't know anyone who has been to grad school much less have this dilemma. I didn't think I would get in so I don't know what to do anymore. Im a standard 25 mins away from CSULB vs 5 mins from CSUDH. I don't know the campus or drive. I just want the best education and program for a great post degree job as well. Thank you in advance!!!",

With the exception of two tenured professors who are mean as hell, the rest of the faculty at CSUDH are nice and care for the students. The problem is that they cannot retain a Chair so the program is in constant chaos. I hope CSUDH MSW stabilizes because their model is based on CRT, which is amazing. It's just too bad that they can't get their act together.\n\nCSULB, on the other hand is a really good MSW program and is highly respected.  I get that you reside close to DH, but go to LB. It's a far better program.",

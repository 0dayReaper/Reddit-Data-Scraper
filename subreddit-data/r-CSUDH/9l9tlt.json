    "postText": "I recently applied to transfer to csudh from lbcc and graduate with an associate degree in kinesiology.\n\nAfter I was disqualified from csulb I paid for one class to raise my GPA at csulb to above a 2.0. Currently my overall GPA is around 2.7-2.8. Its not great but I also made progress towards my degree by finishing anatomy and physiology with a B in each class.\n\nMy question is what are my chances that csudh would accept me? I heard being disqualified from another csu looks bad on your record.",

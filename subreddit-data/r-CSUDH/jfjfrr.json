    "postText": "Hi it is October 21. I know its too late to drop a course, and a drop means to drop the course without a W letter going on your record. But is it too late to withdraw from a course? I really need to, I'm scared a D will really mess up my GPA and affect my financial aid so I really need to withdraw the course, but im scared i passed the deadline. Please help. the academic calendar doesn't say when the withdraw deadline is",

Youll have to fill out some forms, convince your professors that you have a good reason for withdrawing, show PROOF of your serious or compelling reason, and have them sign off on it. Good luck",

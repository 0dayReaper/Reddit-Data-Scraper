            "comment": "The on campus area is pretty safe in general. It gets a little sketchy after dark (in an \u2018unpredictable party people\u2019 way, not a \u2018Rob and murder\u2019 way) but you\u2019ll be fine if you keep aware and stick to the paths/well lit/public areas. There are campus police line everywhere who will give you a lift if you need it, and the administration is pretty understanding when it comes to safety. The area around the campus is a little sketchy, but you can get to the bus stop and/or the freeway pretty easily. It\u2019s not a war zone or anything, but you\u2019ve got to keep aware of your surrounding. Like on campus, as long as you stay in well traveled areas, you\u2019ll be fine even after dark.\n\nAdditionally, once a semester, every student is required to complete an online seminar on domestic and sexual violence. Not sure if it actually translates to lower crime rates, but at the very least it means that csudh students have a deeper understanding of the issue.",

Living on: they have dorms and building extra (I heard it's pretty close to being done). Living off campus - I looked into that as well but the area is residential so not many options there. You'd have to drive to campus anyway.",

The housing right next to school is also pretty decent area to live should you not want/aren\u2019t selected to live on campus. Personally I thinking living on campus is expensive, granted all furniture is given to you. Only reason I didn\u2019t apply for it is because I didn\u2019t want to share a room. I ended up finding a room in someone\u2019s home with complete privacy for less than half of what I would\u2019ve paid on campus. \n\nI would avoid any city bordering Compton (that\u2019s just my 2 cents). Long Beach is decent but there\u2019s a lot of bad areas especially at night time. Torrance/Redondo are better areas but also more expensive. \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately up to you, this is just my thoughts.",

Fall 2019, Dominguez had no significant crime. \n\nYou can go to campus police website and look for the Jean Clery Act statistics and it tells you all of the crime that has been reported on campus. Most of the crime reported at DH is from the La Galaxy /Chargers Stadium (drunk dudes fighting each other over their sports teams).",

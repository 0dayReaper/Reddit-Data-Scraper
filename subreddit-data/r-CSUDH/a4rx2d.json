    "postText": "I\u2019m in the last week of school and I\u2019m a psych major. My question was if I end up getting a C- in my pairs classes and/or PSY490 seminar class, can I graduate? This is my last semester...hopefully. One of my pairs classes is at a 71% grade and I\u2019m worried if I don\u2019t do well on my final and somehow I stick at that grade will I be able to graduate? I keep hearing that a C- is pretty much a failing grade.",

            "comment": "Depends on what grade you need to get credit for the course. In a lot of cases, a D is a passing grade for the sake of credit, but if you were ever to use your transcripts to get into a graduate program, and you received a D in a prerequisite, you'd probably be required to retake it. Other than that, a lower grade really only effects your GPA, which is really just short hand for how well you did overall. You can have a 3.5+ GPA with a D or two and no one would ever think to look.\n\nIf the course is pass/fail, a C grade is usually the cutoff for passing.",

Your student advisor at the time or anything?",

If coming from a community college, there\u2019s otherwise [guidelines/requirements](http://www.calstate.edu/transfer/requirements/csustudents.shtml), the most common scheme of which is called the IGETC.\n\nInter-CSU transfer is probably (hopefully, for you) different.  You\u2019ll have to probably talk to people from both schools to figure out how to navigate it.\n\nWhat department are you looking to study under?  If it\u2019s computer science I may be able to put you in contact with the chair; he seems to like me.  I can PM you his number and email at the very least.\n\nIf it\u2019s another department I can\u2019t help you much other than recommending you look up who to email or call on the csudh website.",

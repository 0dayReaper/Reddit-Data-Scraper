It\u2019s mostly just a campus tour with some team building stuff, but people do get divided by majors. Counselors usually take these major groups aside throughout the day to go through the different tracks and requirements. That should probably answer all your questions about any specific major requirements. A few orientations are usually held in the summer, but make sure to register ASAP because you never know how full the date you want will get (and of course, everything is still weird with the pandemic so you might want to start planning ahead of time)\n\nI\u2019d also recommend try to get in touch with people right now if you think you might need to be involved with a specific student service like the dreamers/undocumented program, the veteran center, or disabled students. These offices can get CRAZY busy during the semester, so it\u2019s best to work out what support you need before you start",

    "postText": "Just because all the stall doors are closed DOES NOT MEAN that all the stalls are occupied. The materiel the doors are made of is very heavy, causing the doors to automatically swing closed. Please actually *check* to see if there are any unoccupied stalls available before you start a line. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been stuck in one of these line sonly to find out after a long wait that half the stalls were empty the whole time. it\u2019s EXTREMELY infuriating!",

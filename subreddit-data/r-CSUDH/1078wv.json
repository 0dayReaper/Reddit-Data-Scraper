    "postText": "Look up. See that alien in the top left corner? Quick, avert your eyes - he's naked!\n\nYou can help maintain some dignity in this forum by submitting your designs for a custom Reddit alien. Images should reflect the spirit of our school, or at least give the poor little guy something to hide his shame in. \n\nThe winner will receive a CSUDH shirt so they can show it off, while gushing about how they won it by clothing our alien. You will gain friends, I promise. \n\nDeadline is Friday, October 19. Send image via a file-host link sent to kill_me_plz. Good luck!",

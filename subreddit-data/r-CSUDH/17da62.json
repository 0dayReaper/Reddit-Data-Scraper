I think I have a pretty good chance of getting accepted into the Cal State but I heard it's way harder to actually get any CLS classes or to get clinical rotations. Does anyone have any useful input/advice/comments? I don't want to spend lots of years here, just 1 or 2 would be great. I'm nervous about moving all the way over there just for 1 or 2 classes and a 3 year wait for clinicals. ",

I'd like to help you, but I'm currently getting my masters in another subject so I don't really know how to answer your questions other than by telling you to have contact with your departments head professor. Hope this helps and good luck!",

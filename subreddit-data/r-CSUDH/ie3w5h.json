    "postText": "Hi, how\u2019s it going guys. Just wondering if anyone knows, first of all, does the Financial Aid office ever pick up their 310 area code phone number for any questions because it just places me on a queue for so long. I have been on it for 1 hour and still no response for the past couple days. Also, my financial aid package has not been accounted for at all so I have no financial aid to be applied to my account for the balance I am supposed to pay by Monday, the 24th of August for the first day of school, does anyone know what to do for that? I have already sent out a email, no response yet. It seems as though if everyone is working from home for Financial Aid, its taking a pretty long time. Any help from anyone is much appreciated, thank you!",

It\u2019s three equal payments towards tuition but the first one (for me at least) was due the 13th do since I haven\u2019t received any aid yet, that\u2019s what I did.\n\nYes it all goes towards tuition.",

I also haven\u2019t received my aid but apparently because I took a summer class they have to make sure I passed that class before they disperse any aid. Unfortunately, the call failed and that\u2019s all the information I got. Did you take a summer class by any chance?",

It doesn\u2019t make sense why they could not finish majority of Financial Aid apps that were turned in from first come first serve way because i know 2 people that did their Fafsa waaaay before I did mine and they already got their money.",

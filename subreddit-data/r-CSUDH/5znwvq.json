I can tell you first hand that most departments are amazingly helpful and want to see you succeed. I can only speak for the biology department since I was a transfer student and have dealt more with them than other departments, but every faculty member has always shown how much they want all of us to succeed. I know many alumni who have graduated and landed great full time jobs or have gotten into top medical, vet, and dental schools, aside from PhD and other graduate programs. CSUDH has only been a positive experience for me, but I know plenty of students who were also extremely surprised of the quality of education for the price, and who are now proud toros. ",

If you are planning on going into a more technical field, try looking into the Cal Poly schools. They're part of the CSU system, but have fewer humanities and more specialized STEM programs. Ultimately, what you study and the level of preparedness you obtain is up to you.",

CSUDH grad programs can be extremely economical and effective. And as far as I'm concerned, your education is in your own hands. Teachers are simply guides to help you expand your thinking. You are the one who needs to read voraciously and write unceasingly.\n\nMy professors, of which there were three, were educated as follows:\n\n1) UCLA PhD and MA from UCLA in Linguistics; MA in Slavic Languages from Berkeley; BA in Russian from Stanford\n\n2) PhD in Linguistics from UC Irvine (least decorated, but hyper-intellectual)\n\n3) BA and PhD in Linguistics from Berkeley (got his PhD at 22 years old and has been a powerhouse in Linguistics for over 40 years)\n\nI suggest looking into the teachers of a major rather than looking at the school as a whole because no school is strong in all fields. DH is extremely strong in linguistics, education, science, and obviously in social fields (it is the schools focus).\n\nI should add that I got a full-time job the month after I graduated, have since been hired as an adjunct English professor as well, and literally have job offers overflowing my e-mail. Additionally, compared to the other workers in my field, my knowledge of language is superior. Maybe it was those 30-page research papers my Ivy-league-adjacent professors were foisting on me. :(",

    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm a new moderator. Just wanted to let you know about a few things going on here. \n\nFirst of all, it is so great that we can have this board for our school. Looking at the post history, it seems as though a majority are from the university's PR office. People: we can do better than that. Post what is happening with you at Dominguez, how you feel about teachers and administration, funny shit that happens, etc. Let's take this as an opportunity to use our voice as students and help each other out.\n\nOn that note, a message regarding spam. This is your community. If you see spam, report it. Stick it up to the Spam Man, man. \n\n Let's get active here. Tell your friends. The more original content we post, the more fun we can have. \n\nThat's all. Thanks for reading. Go Toros. Moderator OUT!",

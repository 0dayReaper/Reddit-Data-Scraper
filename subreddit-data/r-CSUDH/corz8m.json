            "comment": "Depending on what time your class starts, you could park in the Galaxy stadium parking for free. \n\n1: Go through the main entrance on Avalon.\n2: Turn into the stadium on E 184th street which is Gate A. It's very obvious that this is main entrance with the entire drive through lined with palm trees and Galaxy stuff.\n3: At the end of the palm tree lined entrance there is a ticket booth and usually a person inside, tell them you wish to visit the \"L.A. Galaxy Team Store\" and they will direct you to turn left and park in the first open parking lot on your left hand side. All of this will be very clear once you turn left from the ticket booth because the maintenance people park there along with low level stadium employees and anyone visiting the stadium for whatever reason. Needless to say there will be plenty of cars there and you do NOT need any special pass or ticket to use it since this is the day time parking lot during regular work days/ visiting.  It's a very short walk to campus from here and I have been doing this the entire summer semester. \n\n*Key factors to consider*\n\nI believe the team store opens at 10am. But it may be 9am.\n\nI have only done this the past two summer semesters, but I'm not sure what the difference is during spring/fall. In theory it should be easier since there will be more cars around.\n\nHopefully your class starts near the same time as the team store opening. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

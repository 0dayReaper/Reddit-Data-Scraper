Welcome back!\n\nThought I'd make an (unofficial) Fall 2016 thread where anyone share whatever is on their mind, ask questions, get answers, and maybe make friends.\n\nMaybe go ahead and introduce yourself or something about you while you're at it!\n\nI'll be checking this thread all day and I can offer some help to those who need it about anything on campus. If you need a friend, well I can do that too.\n\nHope you all have a great first week at school!",

I asked him a few questions about the major and my graduate school options and had a pretty negative vibe coming from him. Considering that he is the department chair for the Psychology Dept, left a negative view of the college in general. ",

That's unfortunate a dept chair wasnt delightful enough for those attending an open house. But hey as long as you're happy wherever you are that's what is important. ",

I was really excited to attend the workshop too since he was the dept. chair - but considering my experience after I asked him my questions, if he's the dept. chair - I can't imagine how much worse everyone UNDER him was going to be. \n\nOn the bright side, my experience encouraged me to apply elsewhere so it's a good ending overall.

He came off borderline arrogant. ",

I have not received any checks or direct deposit so far to this day. There has been no holds, no alerts, no nothing to alarm me I have an issue holding the grants back from being distributed.\n\nAnyone know?",

When I got two grants a few years ago I had to accept them online first, then they mailed me the checks with the money a few days or weeks later I can't remember the time exactly. It's pretty much simple as that. Find out which method you signed up for to receive your money. These things may just take time. ",

Is there a way to check on my CSUDH? I tried looking.\n\nThe e-mail I received had this to say:\n\nFinancial Aid begins disbursing to student accounts approximately 10 days prior to the first day of classes. Financial Aid refunds are scheduled to be processed by Student Financial Services a few days before the first week of classes. Students should expect to receive their refunds around the first day of classes\n\nI'm just nervous because I paid part of the tuition for fall 2016 before my financial aid got approved and I still need to pay for it.",

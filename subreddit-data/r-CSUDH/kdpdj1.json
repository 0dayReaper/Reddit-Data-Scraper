I enjoy playing sports and running, playing video games, and cooking and eating a lot. It would mean a lot if you guys could help me by responding to this because as the day before acceptances get closer, I am getting more confused on where I want to be for the next 4 years. (Looking to be a business admin major).",

Csudh isnt your party type school, everyone does the work and goes but you can make some best friends there, I know i did (graduated already with a b.a and just recently and m.a)",

            "comment": "Business Admin major here, what concentration are you looking to get? From my experience, we have a pretty great faculty (I am in the middle of my junior year). Some of my professors also teach at other schools such as CSUF (my professor for OMG 321 Business Stats also teaches Business Analytics at Fullerton). One downside is that you can\u2019t really double major, and picking up a minor can be a pain since classes cannot double count. The biggest driver for me ultimately was the location. If I lived in Long Beach, or closer to CSUN, I would have picked the closest school. Also, I have yet to take a class in person due to the lockdown (I am a transfer student). I cannot comment on the networking opportunities since a lot of places are not hiring now. I did the virtual job fair this semester , but there were just a few recruiting options. \n\nIf you decide on CSUDH I can give you some tips on who to take! Overall, I think the quality of education is similar to the other CSUs.",

I'm not in the business program so I can't speak for that but I have found that, if you're a good student and show genuine interest in the work it is a lot easier to get professors to recognize you and talk to you. \n\nThis is a commuter school so if you are just looking to get your degree and professional experience and have a smaller friend group then you should be fine. If you are looking for that certain \"college experience\" maybe not. It really depends.",

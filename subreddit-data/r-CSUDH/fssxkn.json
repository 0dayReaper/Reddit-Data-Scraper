I currently work in an entry level accounting position (billing coordinator) and am going to school in the evenings. \n\nDoes anyone have any feedback on this program? How were the professors/courses? I like math overall, and already took an Intro to Computer Science class taught in Python at my community college. \n\nThanks!",

I am sad to hear about business programming being taught in visual basic! \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind, do you regret choosing Analytics over econ at all? The reason I ask is because I also got into CSUN for Econ (as well as CSULB and CSUF for accounting). Based on those options and what you already know about the program, do you think CSUDH is as good of an option as those choices?",

I hope your answers can help out other future students with similar questions to mine. \n\nHave a good one!!",

My current company has hired people from CSUDH for accounting (the department I currently work in) I don\u2019t think anyone really cares. But that is a good tip for those potentially looking at an academic career!",

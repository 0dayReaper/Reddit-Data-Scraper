Question is, does anyone know when that Grant will be in your bank account? Will it take 3-5 days or will it be more?",

Your grant should've been in your account 2 weeks ago or you should've received a check this week if you don't have direct deposit. The summer tuition won't be distributed until May 26. Hope this helps !",

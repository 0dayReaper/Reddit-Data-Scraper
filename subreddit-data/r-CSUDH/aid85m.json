    "postText": "I'm currently in northern California, but I'm applying to marriage and family therapy programs in Southern California, and I'm wondering what it's like to go to school/live in the area. I know that's asking a pretty broad question, but I was just hoping for general thoughts and feelings.\n\nIs the campus nice? Is Carson safe? If I were to commute from somewhere like Long Beach, would I be pulling hair out in traffic every day? Any information would be greatly appreciated!",

Most of the classrooms - especially any with computers in them - showed their age when I was there last year.\n\nThe area is relatively safe as far as I can tell.  I wouldn\u2019t leave anything valuable in your car, but you\u2019re not going to get shot.\n\nLots of people commute from LB.  The main difference between traffic in the Bay and LA is that rush hour ends up north.  Other differences are traffic moves at 85 mph in LA if there isn\u2019t a jam instead of 65, and the roads/merges/etc. are less ridiculous, except in pasadena.\n\nThe food in LA is way better.",

            "comment": "So I can only speak from my experience. I'm a non-traditional student (as in old af), currently a double major in Math and CS at CSUDH with two different software internship experiences and a job lined-up after graduation. Please don't get the idea that just because it's not a big name school that it means the jobs that you crave are out of reach. That said, there are some bias against students from schools like CSUDH. I remember getting passed on an internship because the other applicant went to the same university as the interviewer and therefore are somehow \"more\" qualified; it's unfortunate, but that's a conversation for another post. I know several folks, a lot of whom are my classmates and friends, who went to CSUDH who are holding/will hold full-time positions after graduation. Just like with any academic institution, you have to seek out opportunities yourself. It's silly to assume that just because one goes to CSUDH that they're ill-prepared for the workforce LOL; you need to actually put in the time and effort.  Anyway, here's a list of general and CS specific pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n* Class sizes are small, you really get to know your professors. I was fortunate enough to have mostly great CS professors who will actually spend time helping you solve the problems, which you will have many, especially in Algorithms. You also get to know most of your classmates since they'll probably take the same classes as you. That's the neat thing about going to a small campus.\n* a lot of support programs that most students don't take advantage of or aren't aware of; this was how I got the internships and job. Seek them out ASAP\n* Research opportunities: not me, but I know a few students who are conducting CS research with a faculty member. It's cool that a non-research school has that\n* It's a tight knit community. You pretty much know everyone in your department and your classes.\n* As a Hispanic Serving Institute, there are neat programs like the Google Tech Exchange Scholar program that allows you to go take a semester worth of classes in Mountain View\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCons:\n\n* The CS department DOES lack recruitment and internship opportunities available to its students, which is not entirely their fault either, but there's been little to no effort from the department. Both of my internships were found on my own online.\n* Lack of labs and resources. If I were to reapply, a major turn off might be the lack of actual labs and hands-on work for students. A lot of the classes like computer org and OS should have labs but they don't. A lot of the computers are old-ish and the system overall is dated.\n* The department puts way too much focus on its Computer Technology program (the non-software computer folks), which I think is...silly. And that leads to neglect of its actual CS students who need real experiences to snag a job.\n* Yes, like that one person said, you do have to do a lot on your own if you want to advance in the career because of the above lack in support. In my experience, for every great professors here, there's at least two horrible, terrible ones, and both of them bring down the curve. But to be fair, that's with any school you attend.\n* Lack of school spirit lol. It's a commuter school  that skews an older demographic who are just more than students. A lot of us have work and family etc so it's not a lot of school attachment; just go to class, then go home. But I do think it's slowly changing.\n* they desperately need an Engineering department. Desperately.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nIt's a school with a lot of room to grow and potential, and obviously it could've been improved in certain areas, but  I'm really happy with my overall experience. I'm a transfer, and CSUDH was literally the only school I applied to due to distance and other factors. and yes! You can always transfer to LB, whose parking is up there with the DMV and the LAX traffic as some of the worst things about California. Cheers!",

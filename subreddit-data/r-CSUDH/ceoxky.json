            "comment": "I haven't taken an English class in two years, but before I took my GWAR I went to the \"prep class/orientation\" and it walks you though exactly what the test is about and what they are looking for. The people giving the short 2hour prep class are the same ones grading your test, they constantly remind all the students that the test is designed for an entry level student with very basic English skills to pass. In other words the test is not hard.\n\n You are given a short prompt: example - due to the rise of social media, how has interpersonal communication changed the way we as a society interact with one another. \n\nThen you would give 3 specific examples of 3 populations (teenagers, college students, adults in work environment).\n\nYou write a paragraph for each example and they time the test but everyone finishes with time to spare, use this time to proof read and make sure your answers to the prompt are actually answering the prompt. \n \nWorst case is you take it twice. Also, this test is only a requirement for CSU graduation and the grade will not appear on any transcripts or affect graduate school applications. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

If I remember, this is the only time you can register for the prep class. My prep class was on a Saturday morning 8-10am.",

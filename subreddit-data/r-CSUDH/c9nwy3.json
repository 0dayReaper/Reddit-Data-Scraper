    "postText": "Hi, my name is Karen, 22 years old, and I'm going to transfer to CSUDH this coming fall. Right now, me and 2 other people are searching for 2 bedroom apartment near campus. Since they both will be taking one room, I'll be taking the other room, and I need a roommate so I can afford it! We don't have a set apartment yet, but we are going to look and decide on one hopefully by the end of the month. I would estimate that renting price would be about $500 to $600 a month, depends on which apartment we settle with. If you need a place to stay and don't mind having a roommate, please message me for more details!",

There are far more people concentrating on those areas at CPP than CSUDH. Not that CSUDH doesn't have a good CS department, but if you're leaving the possibility of switching to an engineering degree, CPP is probably a better school.\n\nThat said, Cal Poly is considered part of the CSU system, and traditionally, people transferring from 2-year schools are given priority over people transferring from other institutions. However, there's nothing stopping you from applying to CPP and then transferring your credits if/when you get in. You're also going to have an issue with actually transferring your credits. CPP is on the quarter system while CSUDH is on the semester system.",

But from what I\u2019ve researched there\u2019s not much on it and looking at the film classes and curriculum it\u2019s not very hands on.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed the film program here focuses a lot on film history, screen writing, and producing. \n\nI\u2019m not even sure if they have actual film equipment to rent out. If you find out anything else let me know too lol",

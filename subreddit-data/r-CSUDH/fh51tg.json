    "postText": "I go to DH have a friend who also goes here that keeps telling me that he might have the virus. He came back recently from a trip to Japan and did not go through any type of quarantine or treatments. I have been trying to keep my precautions wear a mask, wash my hands, etc. I am scared every time I step out of my house to go to school because there was already a case in Long Beach/Fullerton. But this can be airborne and I believe that the school should switch to online classes until the issue is tamed or resolved . CSUN and many other universities have taken such measures and ours should too. Health and life is so important and we should take this seriously as other universities have already acted upon it switching to online classes for the rest of the semester .",

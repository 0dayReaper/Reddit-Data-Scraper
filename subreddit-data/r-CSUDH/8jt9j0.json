    "postText": "Any radiologic science majors at cal state Dominguez hills here? I saw they had a bachelors of science degree in this field and I'm interested in what the major is like here. Do you feel like the courses prepare you well to work after graduation? Is this degree marketable? What courses do you have to take and was it difficult to get in? Were there prereqs you could take at a CC before? Are the professors approachable and helpful? Sorry for all question, it just seems so unique! Also why is this one of the only cal states with a major as unique as this?? ",

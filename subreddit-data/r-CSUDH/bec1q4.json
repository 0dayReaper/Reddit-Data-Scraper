    "postText": "Hi, I'm just wondering if transferring to CSUDH is hard? Currently, I'm completing the transfer requirements for the Clinical Science major, but I don't think my GPA of 2.85 is enough? I've been working full-time at a clinical lab while completing the transfer courses, and it's been really tough for me to raise my GPA because of responsibilities. I'm just wondering will CSUDH accept my GPA?",

The clinical program is very competitive and your gpa will matter at the end. Classes are difficult to get into so be prepared to be at DH longer than expected. Plus once your done getting your bachelors you have to do a clinical rotation. Only 45 spots a year they factor in your science GPA, CSUDH GPA, and your overall. Many people don\u2019t get in. Just giving you a heads up because I didn\u2019t know this when I transferred and it\u2019s taken me about five years to finish when it should have only taken three.  Feel free to ask me any questions",

I heard that there's not enough professors to teach certain classes, so they reserve it for students closer to graduation. Did the clinical rotation aspect delay you more, or was it the limited classes? Thank you for your time replying",

You have a better chance at dominguez hills. \nI would say Loma Linda is the best option because it\u2019s a two year program but your gpa would have to be higher and it\u2019s competitive/expensive. \nAnd hospitals don\u2019t just offer internships you\u2019d have to go through an approved program and a lot of other programs only have four positions for the year.\n\nI wish I tried for Loma Linda but my gpa wasn\u2019t as high and it was expensive.",

But keep in mind if you try to apply to another CSU they will ask for your GPA at EVERY school you\u2019ve attended after HS. It\u2019s going to be harder to transfer from CSU to CSU, especially since you\u2019ve been disqualified. People who want to transfer CSU\u2019s get the last bone unless you do extremely well. Your best bet is to click on the link below and appeal. I appealed my admission decision (totally different but using as example) and I was reinstated. I just had to talk to an advisor and figure it out. \n\n\nCheck out this link for more info: https://www.csudh.edu/uac/academic-probation-disqualification/academic-disqualification-form/\n\nOh and have you taken any classes since you\u2019ve been disqualified at a community college that are transferable? How long has it been?\n\nBest of luck! I\u2019m rooting for you to get back in :). Cheers",

I would talk to admissions and records at the CSU you were disqualified from and ask them. If they say no, then you have to work your butt off to bring that GPA up. DH is getting stricter every year with their requirements, so I recommend to do extremely well at your CC.",

However I just saw CSULB\u2019s website for the renewal and it says 5 years must have passed by before you can do the renewal. So I\u2019m going to have to say no it doesn\u2019t seem possible. You\u2019re going to have to start over. Which is okay, take it as a learning curve. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re young. We all make mistakes and it\u2019s not the end of the world. I\u2019m not a smart person; I\u2019m 24 just barely finishing my undergrad. I\u2019ll be 26 when I graduate.\n\nMay I ask you what caused you to get disqualified? Were the classes too hard? Bad time management? What is your GPA right now? \n\nBut like I said, everyone makes mistakes. Learn from it and don\u2019t make the mistake again. \n\nIf you want, and I suggest it, you should talk to the admissions office at CSULB and ask them directly, because the website is a tad bit confusing. \n\nGood luck!",

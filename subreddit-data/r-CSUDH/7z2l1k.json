I know that CSULB is right down the street, but I'm keeping all options open right now.\n\n1) What is the quality of instruction?\n2) How up to date is the curriculum/equipment compared to industry standards? \n",

            "comment": "1. Quality of instruction from my experience ranges from 7/10 - 10/10 relative to other Universities/programs depending on instructor and track. I've taken DMA courses at OCC, CSU Fullerton, CalPoly Pomona, Platt, and UCI.\n\n2. It's been many years since I've graduated, but the curriculum was on par with industry standards. The equipment, I'd say, was \"fair\", or slightly behind the latest, but looking back, I think this was actually a plus. This will date me, but we were still using 2\" reel-to-reel analog then. :) Shortly after, they went all digital with Avid stations, consoles, DAWs, etc. I had several close friends who graduated from Full Sail. Although their equipment was over-the-top, the overall consensus was that it was a far second to actually working knowledge of concepts and theory.\n\nTo be frank, almost everything taught today is relatively easy to obtain in one form or another online/digitally. Anyone who is serious and self-motivated can tackle the material regardless of where you go. This field evolves quicker than most (probably second to I.T.)  and you'll need to keep current since what you've learned will begin to grow obsolete upon graduation. But, for me, the connections and experiences were the most valuable takeaways.\n\nGood luck.",

These are the answers I like to see because from what I understand, this industry is based mostly off connections \u2013I will definitely go check out the facilities and possibly talk to some instructors before making any kind of commitment. \n\nThanks again",

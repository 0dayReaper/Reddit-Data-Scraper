From students, to teachers, to buildings, to events. Any annual events you look forward to? Is there a trend that people do in between classes? Anything that stands out?  Any cool rooms or areas people hang out on or off campus? Things like that (if you were to look back on college, what would u remember being at csudh)",

            "comment": "Look, CSUDH is not a school that has the \"Hollywood movie\" campus life, if you live in the dorms there are more activiites done, like bbqs and sfuff but its a small community. Overall, lots of activities are meant for undergrads and they can be fun, back before everything went online there were alot of free food events and the food was GOOD food, so that was cool\n Other than that, CSUDH is a school where alot of us just go to get our work done and head home, on the other hand, if you make friends you can always hang out with them in the LSU, but like the other user said, its all online and so none of that is happening, pots of virtual events though which always include prizes and prizes are relatively easy to win, one thing though, usually the people participating and winners are csudh student employees.....I know because I had friends who worked for the school and they would tell me that usually they win since no one else enters the giveaways lol",

The fact that the majority of people are commuter, working, and/or post community college transfer student probably plays a lot into that. \n\nThere were some great campus events pre-covid, such as the social justice fair, homecoming, and the famous Powwow and D\u00eda de Muertos displays, but I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019ll be doing them with the pandemic",

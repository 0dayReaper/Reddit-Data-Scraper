    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nSome help and/or advice would be appreciated. I was accepted to dh (contingently) based on self reported info in the CSUapply app. Today I got a call saying I was revoked due to my gpa. Can anyone tell me why the fk would they accept me blindly and then take my money and not refund me any of it?\u2014 okay sorry that was just a vent. But my really question is what can I do? What should I say? Who should I speak to? I worked my ass off to get to where I am. Found a roommate and this happens. Any help is appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.",

I had a rough first 2 years which I failed a bunch of classes. And those were not transferable. Then after dealing with my hard times I changed major and started taking the classes I need to in which I passed all of them the first time with a C or higher. So yeah I\u2019m pretty sure I could\u2019ve gotten in. Dh is not a hard school to get into at all. But anyways thanks for the help",

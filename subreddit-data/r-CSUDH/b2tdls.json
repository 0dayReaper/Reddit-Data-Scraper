    "postText": "What can I do with this degree? I am interested in working with animals. I love animals so much and my dream/goal is to own a sanctuary or rescue. I want to be able to work hands on with animals while keeping them safe/protecting them, advocating for their lives, and studying their behavior. I would love to work for a sanctuary or just do my own wildlife research. Can I do that with the ecology and environmental bio degree, or does that lead to something completely different? What are you guys planning to do that are studying for this degree?",

An ecology degree would definitely give you the foundation needed to get you going in the right direction, but a majority of the work here would have to be done in the form of internships and extracurricular work. CSUDH has a majorly underrated biology program and it\u2019s faculty are really great. Would highly suggest going and mentioning your future goals and interests at each semester advising appointment. Best of luck!",

There\u2019s many things you can do with an ecology degree\n\n\nPark ranger\n\nParks manager\n\nPublic policy\n\nWater control\n\nObviously research\n\nAcademia\n\nTeaching (look into CSI3, they have a STEM support component as well).\n\nZoology\n\nVet\n\nRescue\n\n\n\nEtc. I\u2019d start looking at rescue groups that need volunteers. That\u2019ll get you some experience!",

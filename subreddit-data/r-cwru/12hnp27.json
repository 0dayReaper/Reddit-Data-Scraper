Case is great at creating negative interactions, and I have so few positive memories of my time there or after. \n\nMy case email has been my main email account since 2004 this is such an unbelievable hassle. Tons of accounts all over the internet use my Case oauth token, so I guess I have to lose almost 20 years of access to these things. It used to be a cap of a few GB which I would've found very tolerable. \n\nI already know if someone complains to Miro it's just going to be some stupid boiler plate reply which is a huge hassle to me, for Case to save a few bucks if anything.",

But they refuse to just directly address why they can't do the exact same thing as Cornell, for example.  We're all Case graduates and they think we're stupid.\n\nAt this point I'm probably going to write a very angry letter to Eric Kaler and then make some phone calls if I don't get a response.  I'd encourage you to do the same.  Also contact the alumni association.  They are ostensibly there to advocate for our welfare.",

For me it wasn\u2019t a big deal but I hated being kicked out of an apartment. There were 4 or 5 tenants that had been living there since the 1980s who were elderly and case kicked them out too. I complained adamantly to Snyder, who put me in touch with the guy who made the decision and he assured me they would be looked after. I doubted it. \n\nFunny enough, for months I\u2019d walk by my old apartment and it was empty. That was a 1300/Mo apartment that sat dormant for 3-4 months.",

Say, negotiating the ability to still access Google workspace or the like. Shopping around for another service to take on the mantle of the promise.\n\nCWRU is a *for profit* business.

I called 368-HELP they had no guidance, the representative typed up my question and sent it off someplace.

I started my second email migration attempt over a day ago and so far its still going, like 25K messages into the migration.  Seems to do about 700 emails an hour, so my email migration should take a week.\n\nOnce email migration completes I'll try moving my documents.  The rep I emailed with said they do have a plan B for document migration failures.\n\nMy own plan B for email would be fetching all of the email via IMAP.",

Whether he or someone higher up the chain made the decision, we don't know.\n\nI made a post last July regarding CWRU terminating what remains for the Adobe solutions contract. If you were/are an active user on this sub, you would surmise that the G-Suite is next. I am ashamed regarding CWRU's decisions, but CWRU is a business.\n\nAs an aside, other educational institutions have wrestled with Google's decision for the data limit. Case could purchase more data from Google, but the admin didn't.\n\nI started undergrad at Case when we had Case Mail ([mail.case.edu](https://mail.case.edu), anyone remember that?). As an alumni, I am happy that they preserved mail forwarding for us. I don't know regarding data limits for the current email forwarding for alumni, but Case Mail had around 100MB for total size ( please correct if I am wrong). I would like  Case ITS (now rebranded as \\[U\\]Tech)  clarify its limits for attachments.\n\nEdit: correction from u/DubDubz for Case mail size.",

CWRU *might* reach that number with all students, staff, and alumni since 2008, but I don't think so. Regardless, the pricing Google gave for extra space was astronomical.",

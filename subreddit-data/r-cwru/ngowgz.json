They see stats about instances of crime at case on places like college factual and they think Cleveland is a very dangerous place. Is it? If not, maybe provide some personal anecdotes that I can use to help convince them otherwise?\n\nThey are also very racist and they don\u2019t like that Cleveland is 49% African American... idk what to say to counter that.",

            "comment": "I mean, Cleveland usually makes it into the top 20 most dangerous cities in the US, but it really depends on where you go. In Uptown, crime will be less because there are patrol cars from both Cleveland police and CWRU police in the area, but like any city, there's still always a risk. My Case-owned apartment got burgled, and while they caught the guy who did it, it was still pretty traumatizing. Lucky for everyone else, that made me the bad part of that statistic and no one else I knew had anything like that happen to them.\n\nIt also depends on your gender. As a woman, I got a lot of unwanted attention, but luckily most of it was pretty harmless. Not as bad as it was when I was in San Francisco! The main thing your parents probably won't like is that there are typically a few beggars asking for \"bus money,\" and they are almost always Black. They tend to show up around Uptown because of UH and Case, but are ultimately harmless.\n\nI no longer live in Cleveland, but plan on visiting once I can, because I did genuinely love it. Cleveland has a lot of cool stuff, and while it isn't uniformly safe, if you know where to stay and where to avoid, you will seriously reduce risk. Case also has an app that you can set a timer on, and if you don't turn it off (as in get hurt or kidnapped before reaching your destination), Case police will be contacted and sent to your location. And always lock your doors, and don't leave things unattended! Which are pretty basic city life stuff.",

            "comment": "In &gt;90% of cases, the ppl who get mugged here are generally doing incredibly irresponsible things and (frankly) acting stupid. For example, all students get police alerts for each crime on campus, and some of the most memorable incidents include:\n1) A student let a random person on the street \"borrow\" their phone, and the guy subsequently ran off with it.\n2) A student opened their wallet right in front of a homeless man. He snatched it and ran.\n3) Perhaps the most common dumb move: Wandering off-campus, alone, past midnight. \n\nUniversity Circle is policed by 4 seperate police forces: Cleveland PD, University Circle PD, University Hospitals PD, and CWRU PD. It is honestly the safest place in Cleveland. If you exercise just a little bit of common sense, you\u2019ll be fine. Obviously, it\u2019s probably less safe than a school in the middle of no where like Cornell or Dartmouth. But if you\u2019d like to live in a metro area, CWRU is about as safe as it gets. \n\nThere are a lot people here who\u2019ve spent their entire pre-college lives sheltered at fancy private schools and/or gated communities, so they like to talk about Cleveland like it\u2019s Iraq. But truth be told, it\u2019s not materially less safe than any other major city in the United States. \n\nAs for the race thing, maybe try telling them that it\u2019s not the 1920s anymore and that they need to stop their backward-ass thinking. If you\u2019d like to go to any half-decent university, any half-decent graduate school, or work for any half decent employer, you are going to have to learn to work with diverse people from backgrounds different than your own.

We would regularly be getting security alerts, some of them serious and some hilarious (someone stole a dude's pizza while he was walking on campus with it).  I think there was a solid month where we got at least one security alert in a day. With that being said, you can avoid a lot of it if you're constantly aware of your surroundings, don't be on your phone while you're walking around, etc.  I've lived in other major cities so crime isn't foreign to me, but it did seem like Case and Cleveland had it worse than what I was used to.",

Compared to other cities of it's size the crime rates are generally lower in most instances. What really matters is whether campus is safe. Campus has alot of security and I would say it feels fairly safe, especially during the day.

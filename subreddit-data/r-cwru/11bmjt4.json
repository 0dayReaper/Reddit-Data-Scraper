    "postText": "I am a freshman choosing a summer stat class as a premed. I am looking to do as much research as possible, and eventually independent projects. I want to do stat this summer so I can apply it both in the lab I am at  and for premed requisites.\n\nI\u2019ve heard 312 also has R, and that because of it you mind as well take 312R. I hate comp sci/engineering/physics (not really but it\u2019s not my strong suit), so I would prefer the easier course. But I also want to make sure I\u2019m not losing out if I choose one over the other.\nWould appreciate advice",

Though take my experience with a grain of salt, I took the class back in 2018.\n\nI don't remember my prof's name, but I do know he is no longer with the university anymore.",

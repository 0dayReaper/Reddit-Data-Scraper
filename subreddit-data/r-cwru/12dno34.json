In the second semester take Calculus 2, ENGR 130, Physics (E&amp;M), and Strength of Materials. *Probably you can wiggle those around between semesters if necessary and take a SAGES course or two as well if you can.**\n\nSophomore year: Take Statics, EMAE 160, Calculus 3, and EMAE 250 in the first semester. In the second semester take Dynamics, Circuits, Modern Physics, Differential Equations, and Thermodynamics. *That second semester looks really full to me, but it has been a while since I graduated**\n\nJunior Year: Take Strength of Materials, Measurements Lab, Fluid Mechanics, and Engineering Analysis in the first semester. In the second semester take Aerostructures, Controls, Aero/Gas Dynamics, and Heat Transfer. *It starts getting harder to move classes between semesters at this point. If you are struggling to make a schedule work, be sure to talk to an Advisor or Navigator**\n\nSenior Year: Take Orbital Dynamics, Flight Dynamics, and Design of Fluid/Themal Elements in the first semester. In the second semester take Aerospace Design, Propulsion, Communications for Engineers, and a Senior Project. *Be sure to check your Breadth requirements in SIS so you graduate as expected!**",

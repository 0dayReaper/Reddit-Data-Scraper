    "postText": "Hi all! I'm interning at NASA over the summer, so I am looking for a place to live in Cleveland. Start and end dates are June 5 - August 11, so basically looking for a three month sublease.  \n\n\nI am hoping to find a 1-person studio or a private room in a shared apartment, but I am open to other options as well. I have also found a few Airbnb options, so pm if you are in a similar situation and looking for a place to live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little about me: I am a junior at UVA studying CS. I enjoy cooking, listening/playing music, and exploring places and meeting new people. I'm a guy, but open to living in a co-ed space!",

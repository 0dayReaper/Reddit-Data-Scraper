    "postText": "Will be attending Case and I am looking for a 1 bedroom under $1k with an in unit washer/dryer and parking. I feel like it is a big ask because a lot of the apartments that I have been seeing are at least $1300 but maybe someone here can point me into the right direction? I have a car so the apartment doesn't have to be super close to school.",

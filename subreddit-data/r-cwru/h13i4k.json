    "postText": "Hi folks, I did some research and created a simple [site](https://coda.io/@collegetuition/case-western-reserve-university-tuition) for visualizing college costs and stats at CWRU. After listening to the Numbers Geek podcast, I was curious about how tuition is being used, how much each student costs the university, and revenue generated per student. I ended up looking up admissions and enrollment data as well. Would love your thoughts!",

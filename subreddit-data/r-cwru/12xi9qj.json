Not familiar with IB and how that works so not sure how to ask that.\n\nTrying to get a feel for chances of admission.  TIA.",

It gives a profile of admitted students. \n\nThe key things are.\n\nHigher gpa is better\nHigher rigor relative to what your school offers is better (honors, AP, IB)\nHigher test scores are better \nCompelling thoughtful essay.\n\nIf your school offers honors and AP you need to take them within reason. \n\nThere\u2019s also a chance me Reddit. \n\nGood luck.",

I also take dp arabic (junior/senior year) since I go to an ib split school. Did not take the ap bio or lang exam, but will be taking 3 exams this year. Accepted into case for compsci w/ a 3.9(unweighted), no sat score\ud83d\udc4d\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s worth mentioning that I did take quite a few honors classes like physics, chem, english, history etc during 9th and 10th grade.",

My brother applied the year after me and had more ap classes and everything was just a little higher (We\u2019re both legacy too). I was accepted EA and he was waitlisted, likely because case was my top choice and I showed a ton of interest, he didn\u2019t do all that and ended up very happy at OSU",

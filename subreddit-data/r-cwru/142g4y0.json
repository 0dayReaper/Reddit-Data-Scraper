    "postText": "Been a few months since I looked, but is the status of this update still just \"lol get bent alumni\"? Really disappointed as we were very explicitly promised that we would have complete access to this email in perpetuity. I have sent the IT department multiple emails to the address in the announcement letter, and those have of course been ignored.\n\nBefore the regular crew of \"hey Case had no choice!\" folks show up, I have a few friends at/alum of institutions in the same boat that worked out a data cap (~5-10GB) that sounds like just would have cost the university a skosh more money, which sucks but is a lot better than just giving alums, particularly recent alums, a collective middle finger.\n\nI guess this turned into a venting thread, so apologies. Man, if you are a current student, don't take *any* commitment Case gives to you for when you are alumni to heart.",

Under the new policy, which takes effect at the end of June 2023, alumni will have six months to set up a forwarding email in order to still receive relevant emails. After six months, you will no longer have access to any part of your CWRU email.",

Certainly better than losing those emails.\n\nRegarding google drive migration, when I called 216-368-HELP they also had a secondary method to move files.  They created a shared drive shared with my [case.edu](https://case.edu) account and my new [gmail.com](https://gmail.com) account.  this allowed me to move my files from the [case.edu](https://case.edu) Google Drive, into the shared drive, then I could move them again to my new gmail account.\n\nThe crazy method I used to move emails is a tool called GYB (Got Your Back):\n\n[https://github.com/GAM-team/got-your-back](https://github.com/GAM-team/got-your-back)\n\nIt worked awesome, but don't recommend it unless you are a computer science type - its a python script that spins up some google cloud instances to use Gmail APIs to move your email.  The Thunderbird method is what I would advise almost everyone to do.\n\nI used this method because it preserved all my multiple labels without any duplicates.  I used the MS Windows version.  It took about an hour to backup 180K emails using 10GB of space, restoring the emails took 2 days.  But it uses an sqlite database to keep track of what messages it restored, so if something happens you can resume where you left off - something Google's own tool couldn't manage to do.  I did two restores - one of a throwaway gmail account as a test to learn how to use the tool.  Then a did a second restore to my long term personal gmail account.",

I agree, and this is part of the reason why the email is special. I have a slight aside, if you don't mind. Case ITS offers solely one wall ethernet jack in some dorms. They might open the other ethernet jack if a student creates a ticket. \n\nI know that CWRUnet fiber optics isn't special (and is quite outdated), and you obtain similar speeds when connected to CaseGuest.",

You were loaned a 155Mbps card from FORE Systems model PCA-200E (for PCs) and it used ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) not Ethernet as the layer 2 protocol (using OSI model).    This was super futuristic and a major selling point of CWRU - most people had experience the internet only over dialup at this point. The network cards were wildly expensive like $1500 each in 90's money, also ATM was complicated and so it eventually lost in the marketplace to Gigabit Ethernet.\n\nIf your computer was incapable of using ATM (for example, a laptop which wouldn't have a PCI card slot), then you received a Multimode Fiber to RJ45 or AUI transceiver and your faceplate was patched into 10Mbps ethernet, but the entire building was on a single Hub (not a switch) so it was terribly slow.  Since it was a hub, the entire building was a single ethernet collision domain - you did not want to be on Ethernet.\n\nSince nothing was encrypted on the Internet yet, if you were on Ethernet and since the network used hubs and not switches, you could put your Ethernet NIC into \"promiscuous mode\" and look at everyone else's data going through the network.",

If you want to wait a week or so, Apple is about to announce their 15\u201d MBA. \n\n\nFor reference, I have a MacBook Pro and it\u2019s been completely overkill even in my engineering major. You really don\u2019t need a Pro.",

If the 16gb version is cheaper, then get that instead. \n\n\nI have the i9 MBP and it\u2019s been fine. I\u2019d recommend trying to step up to an M1 if possible because the battery life is atrocious, it will not run more than 3 hours off battery alone.\n\n\nedit: if you want to run windows apps natively on your mac, then stick with the i9 because it has bootcamp.",

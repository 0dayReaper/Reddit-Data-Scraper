Cuz you won't like the houses on top of the hills of the SRV(Calton Community, I believe that's what they called) as well - no buses, and you have to WALK the ridiculous stairs for 5-10 minutes to get down to Fribley, or to the quad. And here are some chances that you may consider: ask if your friends got bad number for the lottery for STJ and triangle, and you can join them to form a 5-person or 6-person group for the SRV. I don't know if the lottery for the SRV is drawn yet, but by this you at least live with friends. Btw, my group aimed for SRV at the very beginning because there are kitchens in certain buildings. We got the last room down the hill that has a kitchen. So good luck!",

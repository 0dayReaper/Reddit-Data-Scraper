    "postText": "Hi I'm a little bit confused about the 1st year meal plans offered. Correct me if I'm wrong but 1 meal swipe counts for 1 meal right (either breakfast, lunch or dinner) so if I chose the '17 classic' meal plan doesn't that mean I would only have enough swipes for 5 days and 2 extra meals in one week assuming I eat 3 meals a day? What would I be expected to do on the weekends or the days I don't have any swipes left?",

            "comment": "Yes, 17 meals are not enough if you eat 3 meals a day. Most ppl don\u2019t actually eat 3 meals a day, which is why many have swipes left. If you are certain you will eat 3 or more meals a day, and don\u2019t mind eating the dining food multiple times, go for the unlimited one. Otherwise, you can always use case cash and real money if swipes aren\u2019t enough.",

I remember Friday lunch being the easiest to find. \n\nPlus, you will get bored of dining hall food. It might take till February, but it will hit. \n\nDon't over buy on the meal plan.

Secondly, at least in my experience, when no one is there to make sure you wake up early during the weekends, it is very often that you end up only eating 2 meals on the weekends. Obviously, no one knows you better than yourself, if you believe unlimited is the right way to go, then go for it (I, for one, like the flexibility the unlimited option gave me). If you still aren\u2019t sure, try going for the unlimited first, and decide if it\u2019s too much, and you can switch (You can switch every semester if I\u2019m not mistaken).",

Hard to find free stuff at 2 AM. \n\nThere are tons of events happening around campus and nearly always to attract people to the event there will be free food offered. \n\nI remember in particular Friday lunch being easy to find. \n\nThe other times you have both meal swipes and CaseCash to cover you.  \n\nRemember the actual meal count is 19 a week if you eat full meals. 3 a day on weekdays. 2 a day on weekends. The dining halls in my day had reduced hours on weekends. Opened I think 10:30 AM. \n\nA lot of people skip dining hall breakfast, which saves a bunch of swipes. You like me might go to breakfast, so you might use those swipes. \n\nLunch especially Friday lunch there is a talk of some type somewhere you can attend for free food. \n\nDinner can be some social event you attend. \n\nLate night gets hard to find places that takes swipes especially regular swipes. \n\nOn weekends, dinning hall bunch is fine especially Sundays. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never met anyone that wished they had more meal swipes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you do unlimited, you need to make sure to maximum those swipes.

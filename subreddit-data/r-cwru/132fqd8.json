    "postText": "Hey guys\n\nI just got accepted to Case as an out-of-state transfer student. I will be entering my sophomore year this fall, pursuing a BSE in Electrical Engineering. \n\nI'll be living on-campus, but I'm not familiar with the campus/residential halls, so I would appreciate any advice you guys can give me:)\n\nWhat is the housing situation like? Which dorms should I go for/avoid? Are all the good ones filled up or do I still have a chance at getting a decent dorm?\n\nAgain, I'd appreciate any information/advice, about housing or anything Case-related:)\n\nthanks guys",

            "comment": "Welcome to CWRU and Cleveland! Hope you enjoy yourself.\n\nThe housing lottery has already happened this year, so you probably won't have a ton of say in where you end up. You may just get randomly assigned somewhere. With that being said, you can see all the second year buildings [here](https://case.edu/housing/facilities/second-year-buildings), and to contextualize where they are, the campus map is [here](https://case.edu/pdc/sites/case.edu.pdc/files/2018-11/campus-map-1018.pdf). The buildings page contains a link to a google drive with student filmed housing tours, in case you want to see them more in person.\n\nMurray Hill and Carlton Road (F6 on the map) buildings are only 2nd year students, and they're 6 person suites. Every student gets their own room. Individual bedrooms are tiny, and there's a common room and bathroom shared by all 6 residents. These will be the closest to the STEM campus, and have a couple dining hall options near them. Murray Hill is at the bottom of a large hill, whereas Carlton Road is at the top of the hill, and you take a large staircase called the Elephant Stairs to get there. Murray Hill has (negligibly) larger bedrooms, is easier to access and is closer to the main dining hall and campus, whereas Carlton Road has larger suite common rooms, more building common space, better greenspace, and in my experience is a bit quieter and more private. Tippit and Staley House (both Murray Hill) have in suite kitchens, whereas the other 5 have 1 building kitchen and an in-suite microwave. Personally, I lived on Carlton Road my sophomore year and really liked it.\n\nTriangle Tower (E3/F3 on the map) houses 2nd year and upper-class (3+ year) students, and is basically a high-rise apartment building being used as college housing. I believe for 2nd year students, there are 1 or 2 bedroom options, and you get a roommate, so suites are 2 to 4 people (could be wrong, things change fast). Otherwise it's a standard apartment, with a kitchen, a living room, a bathroom and bedrooms. Triangle Tower 2 has a fitness room and a common room, whereas Tower 1 is just residential, and shops on the first floor. It's a bit farther away from dining halls and the engineering quad, but rooms are bigger, and it's closer to the Arts/Humanities/Business quad.\n\nStephanie Tubbs-Jones (E1 on the map) houses 2nd year and upper-class students, and is a modern dormitory. It is by far the newest building for 2nd year students, built in 2015. Rooms are definitely larger, has larger and more modern common spaces, and is generally speaking the nicest of the buildings available (though it also houses upper classmen, so it fills fast, and is more expensive). Suites are 1-4 people, and everyone gets their own bedroom. Every suite has a kitchen, and there is 1 bathroom for every 2 students, so depending on how many people you live with, that's how many bathrooms you'll have. It's on north campus, which houses undergrads of all years (though it is closer to first year housing). It's the farthest from the engineering quad (about 20-25 minute walk, though there is a shuttle system), but is fairly close to the north dining hall.\n\nIf you need accommodations regarding medical concerns or would like to live in a gender inclusive environment (targeted towards trans/non-binary students), contact the school, and they may be able to help you out (no guarantee with how late in the semester it is).\n\nIf you do get some choice in the matter, things to consider:\n\n1. I'd recommend either STJ or Murray Hill/Carlton Road, as it's just much closer to residential villages than Triangle Tower, so you'll be around more people and events, which may make it easier to meet new people.\n2. For Murray Hill, only go for a kitchen if you actually cook regularly. If you're just going to eat in the dining halls, I found the kitchens were generally a hassle, and grocery stores aren't that close anymore (if you're walking, driving you'll be fine).\n3. If you have mobility issues/hate stairs, Carlton Road is terrible. Personally, I loved it.\n4. STJ beds are doubles, whereas the rest are twin xl. Most upper class beds are doubles. Just keep that in mind when buying sheets.\n5. Murray Hill and Carlton Road accommodations are TINY compared to anything else on campus (outside first year dorms).\n\nAt the end of the day though, it's college. Where you live really doesn't matter that much in the grand scheme of things. Even if you hate where you live, it's just a bedroom, you don't have to use it for anything else (or that, even).\n\nSorry for the long rant, but hope you find it helpful. Reach out if you've got any lingering questions!",

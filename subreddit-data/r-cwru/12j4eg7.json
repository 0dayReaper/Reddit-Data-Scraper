You get assigned light manga/article/news reading (10 pages max) between classes, where you'd discuss with your peers in seminar style during class time about the history and development of manga. No cold call, no hw, no quiz, no nothing. The final is making a short manga of yourself or translating one.\n\nIt can be awkward if you have no exposue to the culture beforehand. But with limited exposure, I enjoyed it greatly. There might be classes with a totally indifferent instructor that has a lower absolute workload, but this is the kind of class I went to have a good time. Prof. Onitsuka is also sweet and enthusatic who even made manga herself.",

The new sun rays are sloped and compress horribly. Look at the logos page in the brand portal, they all have compression artifacts. \n\nI can believe focus groups told them to lighten the blue, but I don\u2019t think they should\u2019ve listed to focus groups. The ultra dark blue was a distinguishing feature for the University. Now we\u2019re just blue. It doesn\u2019t matter that you named Pantone 286U \u201cCWRU Blue\u201d, it\u2019s basic.",

It's a subtle change, but the old blue was, IIRC, a unique RGB combination not in most standard color libraries (I had to use the eyedropper tool on the logo to get some slides to match, once). I don't know if the new blue *is* just Standard HTML Dark Blue, but it certainly looks like it.",

Did they pay someone *money* for that?\n\nActually what it looks like is *generic*. Like the logo for a diploma mill or a fictional community college in a TV show. Losing the larger capital letters at the beginning of words makes it much more obvious that it's a single font and not letters that were actually *drawn* by someone; and the straight-on angle for the sunrise and loss of the white internal border simplifies the design and makes it more \"stock clipart of a sunset\" than a specific logo. All it needs is for the sun to be rising out of an open book or something. Finally, while I don't think anyone actually cares when the university was established, removing the date is another thing that makes it look lower effort and College-brand College.",

It is so weird and out of place, they should have just left off the entire 'university' word.\n\nEdit:  \nThe sun logo is definitely worst. The old one genuinely looked like the sun rising behind the planet in a very exploratory sense of being part of the world.\n\nThe new ones feels like something you find in a Jesus-y school \"HE IS RISEN\" or some nonsense.",

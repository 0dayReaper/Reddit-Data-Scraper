    "postText": "At the open house for accepted students, the CSDS presentation showed that there are about 600 CSDS majors and 80 CSDS minor students. With only 16 CSDS faculty, I assume that CSDS class sizes are huge. Is this correct, and if so, does this cause problems? Are the profs available to help students outside of class? Also, how competitive are the classes to get an A?",

            "comment": "Compared to some of the other class sizes at Case, CS classes tend to be on the larger side. The largest CS classes are the ones at the beginning of the major (Java, data structures, logic design) and are around 150-200 people. After that, the CS classes are anywhere from 30-80 people. I'll note that with Java and logic design in particular, the professors really do make an effort to learn people's names. My friend showed up to one Java office hour session and after that the prof knew her name for the rest of the semester. Between the professor office hours, TA office hours, supplemental instructors, free tutoring, and just asking for help from other people in the class, I've never had trouble getting help in a class.\n\nThe one issue I will point out is that it can be kind of hard to get into CS classes past freshman/sophomore year. Case recently started admitting larger class sizes and some of my underclassmen friends are having trouble getting into classes that used to be easier to get into. CS overcrowding seems to be a problem at a lot of universities though. You'll definitely be able to get into the CS classes you need before you graduate, but you might not be able to take them as early as you want.\n\nAs for your last question, I haven't taken a single class here where you need to compete with other students for an A. Your grade is based on your own merit. If you meant how hard is it to get an A, it depends on the professor and the class. In general if you put in the work, an A should be attainable.",

As an example, if you're interested in AI, the only \"Intro to AI\" class has 90 seats and they're immediately filled when registration opens. gl if you're not one of the lucky few\n\n\nUnfortunate that a uni trying to bolster its reputation in CS struggles to accommodate demand for such a crucial course. Especially in today's CS market where AI/ML is a necessity to be competitive.  \n\n\nSure, you can get the popular classes later on when you're a junior or senior, but learning some of these concepts early is important (especially for internships). Fortunately, CWRU is (supposedly) expanding their CS department.",

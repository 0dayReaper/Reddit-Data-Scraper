            "comment": "This is from my daughter who lived in Norton last year. She isn\u2019t on Reddit:\n\nActually the same thing happened to my roommate and I!! We were told juniper dorms were the best (both location-wise and because they had just been renovated), but were assigned a room in Norton (which is mistletoe) instead. Honestly the biggest con of any of the dorms is the lack of AC, which as the seasons change becomes much less of an issue (I would still recommend investing in fans and opening windows though). Personally I think Norton was actually in the best location for me of all the dorm options. It is right next to the dining hall on North Side and the Ugly Statue/The Den, so it\u2019s really easy to have access to both the food options on campus and to the rest of the school from there (plus it makes life easier for move-in/out). Otherwise I think the dorm facilities are pretty similar from dorm to dorm. Obviously the Juniper furniture is slightly different because of the renovation, but it\u2019s the same basic idea made of different materials. The biggest issue is the laundry rooms. For the majority of the year, Norton was one of the only dorms with all working machines\u2026 so students living in other dorm houses abused that and used our laundry room instead of theirs, both making it almost impossible to get your clothes cleaned if you weren\u2019t smart about the times, and eventually breaking one of our washers and two of our dryers in the process. Other than the stress of the laundry room, I think the dorm is great, so don\u2019t stress about losing juniper like I did, it\u2019s actually in a better location than a lot of their dorms. \n\nAs for making friends, most of my friends that I made were from my classes and activities (two of my really close friends live in my dorm because it\u2019s an easy conversation starter and they\u2019re easily available, but most of my friends were made on campus). I was unavailable to attend most of the events hosted by my RA because of the way my schedule worked, but I think had I had the chance to go to them I would\u2019ve made a lot more friends in my dorm, I heard they were fun. If you aren\u2019t a social gatherings person though, don\u2019t worry, there are plenty of ways to easily make friends regardless. Hope this helps!!",

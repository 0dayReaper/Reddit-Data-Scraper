    "postText": "I\u2019m almost out of my first year, and my GPA is sitting at a whopping 2.9. I doubt classes are going to become less rigorous and I feel like I study religiously just to be annihaliated on tests. I enjoy the material, but I feel so defeated when I look that 2.9. Is this a sign to drop-out or switch avenues?",

By the end of my time at case my overall GPA was above 3 but I\u2019d call out that my \u201cmajor gpa\u201d was in the high 3s. (TLDR I got much better grades in my EECS classes than like \u2026 Chem 111 lmao)\n\nBtw if I could go back in time I would tell younger me to not do the BS CompSci and just do BA or whatever instead. I don\u2019t think it did anything for me and just made me take harder classes and had less open electives. Totally not worth. I still vividly remember young me at the major deceleration booth specifying I wanted to do BS. Womp womp",

Never did figure out how to crack that nut.",

No one in the real world will ever ask or care about your gpa. \nThe exception would be if you are serious about grad school which in my opinion is a waste of your resources and loss of income. Sure, some HR wonk will write up a requirement for a \u2018PhD in Logistics\u2019 for a traffic manager position but the hiring manager will get a good laugh and hire you anyway. Especially if you hold a BS in Engineering from Case!",

            "comment": "No reason to switch or fret over a 2.9, average a 3.0 or above and pretty much no employer in the engineering field will care about the difference between 3.0 and 3.8 for your first job (after that, experience is the only thing people look at). Personally I thought that grading got easier as you started to focus on your specific major and it became more about understanding the content than getting a good grade. You can also strategies on which courses you take which semester to get the \"more lenient\" profs who care more about the understanding. Finally, studying too hard might also be a reason why you are having trouble. I found in a lot my meche classes that if I stressed too much about the exam that the natural understanding and enjoyment of the material got blocked out and I'd fail exams. I would recommend going to office hours in certain courses if tests are stressing you out, because its a great way to gain confidence and understanding. Good luck on finals!!",

            "comment": "3 sounds chill to me, depending on what grads program you want to take. I don't like Case's policy that you get 89 you get a B instead of a low A(that happend 3 times to me when I was within 1% to A and the professor wouldn't curve me up). But live with it and enjoy life. Also, there are tons of courses that you can take for free A's and count towards your general education requirement, like all the 101 languages, they are just straightfoward, $100 A's(cuz they want you to physically have the textbook). Also, if you have extra time in senior year, you can retake the classes and if you get a higher grade, you can place it on your transcript: even if the previous C in the first year will still appear on it, it won't count towards your GPA. If you are looking at Ivy Leagues for grads program, let's say, you might need a better GPA. But otherwise, GPA doesn't really matter that much.",

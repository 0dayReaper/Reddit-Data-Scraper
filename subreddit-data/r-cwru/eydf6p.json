Additionally, international students are largely ineligible for financial aid, thereby freeing up more aid resources for other students.\n\nAs a STEM student, I found it useful to have opportunities to work in a heavily international department. Even if the experience was frustrating in the moment it was pretty reflective of the workforce at the types companies I would end up working for",

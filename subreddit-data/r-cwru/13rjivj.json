Should I even send in my AP scores physics biology and chemistry (5 &amp; 4s), if I want to retake all these courses in Case? I am afraid of I send them, they would be marked as repeat on my transcript and negatively impacted my medical school application.",

Therefore If you are premed it might not make sense to test out of core courses in the track using AP. \n\nWrite your advisor to ask on this point as I don\u2019t think you automatically get credit and exempt unless you ask / apply. Read that somewhere.",

You will still have to take the core biology classes, and if you did well in AP chem, you can get out of chem105/111. I got out of 111 but still took 105. Physics I don\u2019t recall (sucked at it lolol), but if you\u2019re premed, you may as well retake all those classes anyways imo",

    "postText": "Just need one more to fill this out. Tried taking a film class this year but it turned out to be a lot of writing and reading, which I didn\u2019t expect, and don\u2019t want a repeat. I\u2019ve already taken the theater tech woodshop class (201 I think? highly recommend btw) so I can\u2019t do that. My main goals are something that doesn\u2019t have a lot of homework, and especially no essays or reading. I do enjoy art, my default choice right now is something baseline like Drawing 1 but there might be something more interesting available.\n\nThanks for any help!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019ll be joining CWRU, and I wanted to know about transport near and around campus. \n\n1) Is it possible to cycle around campus to get to and from your classes at Case? Are there bike paths, cycle parking, and is bike theft common?\n\n2) Do you need a car to travel off campus to nearby eateries and activities or are there public transport options? \n\n3) What is the safe ride system? \n\nThanks all!",

            "comment": "1. Yes, cycling is possible. Be wary that sometimes pedestrian traffic will be super busy and riding a bike will not be possible. Cycle parking is located outside a lot of major buildings, and I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen many bike paths on the road. Bike theft is going to happen, so use a good lock.\n\n2. A car is nice. You don\u2019t need one, as there are a lot eateries on campus. As for activities, most likely yes you need a car. \n\n3. Safe ride basically is a transport system offered by Case that operates from I believe 6 pm-2am(?) and basically you use an app, call a ride, and it picks you up and couple other students to your destination.",

A lot of the decent food comes from the non cafeteria places - plum market and the den (which take the regular meal swipe) and a couple other places spread out over campus that take a 'portable swipe' such as subway and fujisan. Get the unlimited meal plan if you can since you get 7 portable swipes with that. If you want to eat out there are several places on Euclid, most of which take case cash as well (150 bucks which is in your account every sem).",

If you have a lot of classes in the quad and live in Northside (where the freshman dorms are) they're a very good option.",

            "comment": "1. Yes, but this usually means cycling on streets or pedestrian paths, which as someone else pointed out can get quite busy at times. However, biking can often get you between classes wayyy faster than walking which makes it worth it imo. Bike parking is usually very easy to find, but a metal U-Lock is a must. You can get one for free from the school when you submit a bike registration online (there\u2019s a sticker you get to help identify if stolen)\n\n2. I would not say that a car is an absolute necessity to get to activities/eateries off-campus, however many people would find it more convenient. Public transit (RTA buses/trains) and rideshare (uber/lyft) can both get you pretty much anywhere in the city you\u2019d need to go. Also, the school automatically charges you $40/semester for a U-Pass (essentially a sticker that lets you go *anywhere* on the RTA system for free), so it doesn\u2019t hurt to take advantage of it\n\n3. Never used Safe Ride before. As far as I know it\u2019s sorta like uber but it only takes you across campus and only at night.",

I will say many pedestrians will be annoyed if you go on the quad on your bike.\n2. Car isnt needed unless you plan on groceries. could also just befriend an upper classmen with a car\n3. Safe ride is like evening uber for free, but with a big catch.... really long wait times. I'd recommend just using the busses unless you are in an unsafe area within the range of the safe ride",

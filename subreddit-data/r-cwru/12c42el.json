            "comment": "Biochemistry is one of the most popular premed majors at CWRU. Everyone chooses it because it aligns with pre-med requirements really well (kind of designed that way), and the knowledge investment is good if you want to go to medical school, since the first semester of medical school covers biochem heavily anyways.   \n\n\nCheck the CWRU major site for Biochemistry for the best course information, but you'll be taking the biochem classes with a ton of (if not mostly) premeds, so there should be good resources and you should be able to work with/study with other premeds. You also have the option between a BA and a BS and they just made the BS requirements smaller (no higher level calc, etc), so it's not that bad.   \n\n\nAs for how difficult things are, I've only audited a biochemistry class at CWRU (took some of the assessments though). It could be worse. The main upsides are the amount of resources/premeds at CWRU doing it with you, and the way the major aligns with premed requirements nicely. The Neuroscience BS does as well.",

            "comment": "Depends on how you assess pre-med : are you looking at it from the perspective of \"What will be good for me to do well on the MCAT and get a good GPA\" or \"What will set me up for post-undergrad / Med School\". Because for the former, here is the deal. Every pre med has to take a set of courses, regardless of the major. Those courses are more than substantial for you to cover everything you need to know content wise on the MCAT save for Psychology. Biochem can be a challenging major, and if you don't do well it can compromise your GPA, which is important for med school.  However if you do well, you can also demonstrate you can do well in high level science courses. It's a double edged sword. A biochem major is realistically practical only if you're considering a PhD tbh. \n\nMy recommendation is the following: Take it if you think you'll do well and actually enjoy it. Otherwise choose another major. Being a bio Chem pre-med isn't going to help your applications as much as you think, if it does help at all to begin with.",

When you're writing your med school app and you have to explain why you chose your major, you don't want to be caught saying \"it's because it's easy\".\n\nIf you plan to drop out of pre-med, don't start it to begin with. Pre-med is an endurance test to a high degree. \n\nIf you plan on graduating with a major like biochem but not pursuing pre med, then your only realistic option is grad school if you want to be employable .",

            "comment": "Biochem major here! They recently revamped the degree requirements to make it a lot more career focused towards graduate/professional schools. I'd recommend BA if you have another interest on the side, but BS is also great if you're more heavily invested in science/math. If you wanted a \"set it and forget it\" major for fulfilling premed requirements, biochem does it pretty well, but I would definitely prioritize majoring in something you're actually interested in. Feel free to pm me if you have questions about the major!",

(ex. bioengineering, etc.)\n\nEdit: are there active forums to talk with accepted students? so far I'm not seeing any on any platforms",

One of my friends majored in psychology and Spanish and just got into med school, so focus on doing a major that you enjoy and could see as an option for a career if you don\u2019t get into med school.",

I would say it is easier to fit all pre-med classes if you are doing an BA rather than a BS ... but even a BS you would take Physics, English, Calc, Chem anyway like if you were an Engineer. Some people do Biomedical Engineering. \n\nhttps://anthropology.case.edu/undergraduate-programs/majors-and-minors/medical-anthropology/",

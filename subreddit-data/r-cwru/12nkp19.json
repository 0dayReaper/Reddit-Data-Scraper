            "comment": "Case keeps a list of companies who have recently hired students for CO-OP. Here is the EE/CompE/CS list: [https://engineering.case.edu/coop/node/45/](https://engineering.case.edu/coop/node/45/). I'm not sure how up to date this is though. Off the top of my head, some companies that I hear come up a lot for CO-OP are Rockwell Automation, MIM Software, Lubrizol, and NASA.\n\nIn terms of how it affects studies for CS, it's not too disruptive. The only thing to consider is that there are some CS classes that are spring only or fall only, but which semester you take off isn't a huge issue compared to some other engineering majors. CO-OP does tend to delay your graduation by one semester, but I know some people that were able to graduate on time even with CO-OP. It's a really nice break from taking classes and I highly recommend it.",

In the preferred major column, look for computer science or a related term. The NASA Glenn Research Center is about a 30 minute drive from Case, so I know of a decent number of students who have worked there.",

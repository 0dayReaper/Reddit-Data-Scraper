    "postText": "Hey, I hope all these admissions questions aren't too annoying, but I recently got off the waitlist for both CWRU and UW-Madison for BME and am having trouble deciding which one to enroll in. One caveat is that I was accepted to CWRU for the spring semester, which is not too big of a deal, but definitely is an odd situation. Looking at rankings made it even more difficult: according to US News, CWRU is 13th in BME compared to UW's 21st. However, UW's engineering program is 13th and and CWRU's is 45th.  I am not aiming on pursuing premed and and interested in undergraduate research/co-ops, which both have ample opportunity for.\n\nFinances aren't a factor in my decision, nor is demographics. I did visit both colleges and did like Cleveland slightly more, but not very much. CWRU's campus was also more interesting and I am drawn by CWRU's smaller population and class sizes.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for other people's perspectives on this decision as well as some advice/info on spring admission and what drawbacks that could bring. Thanks y'all.",

(like professors care about you more)",

I got an undergrad at a public school and MS at CWRU, and the professors teaching technical classes at the public school cared WAY more about students (even with larger class sizes relative to MS classes). UW Madison has a phenomenal research hospital located on campus. I was part of medical studies as a child and LOVED going to the hospital because of the excellent research staff. Madison as a whole is a beautiful city, especially when compared to the dump that is Cleveland, double especially when comparing the downtown/campus area in Madison to the CWRU area in Cleveland.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOP, UW Madison is the only option.",

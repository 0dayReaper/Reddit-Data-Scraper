    "postText": "Various pros and cons for Case.\n\nMid size. Big enough to have lots of stuff and small enough you are not lost in everything.\n\nClasses sizes are reasonable. The largest lectures are not super huge. Still able to talk with instructor and any assistants easily. Some of the best instructors I had were the ones for large lectures. All the faculty I had at Case were always very accessible.\n\nSAGES is one the least bad ways of doing university wide gen ed. Note for each college there are additional breath requirements as well. For arts and sciences, it is really simple stuff like take 2 humanities and 2 social science classes for STEM majors. AP credit can cover some. Also need a culture  diversity class and it can double count up on some other requirement.  One of your humanities can be marked on cultural diversity list. No foreign language requirement. \n\nOther than nursing and music, students can switch colleges within the university at ease. One admit policy for whole university. Engineering, business, arts and sciences any student can take classes in and declare a major in. Declaring majors is easy. \n\nOne surprising good thing at Case is the administration. The one system, SIS, entered my courses in the wrong boxes and a dean reached out to me to fix it. For anyone that has to deal with bureaucracy, a someone like a dean reaching out to fix something is huge. I sat one on one with her and she fixed all the problems in the system. Way less painless that I thought the process was going to be. Other schools can be nightmares dealing with paperwork problems. \n\nDorms are funny at Case. The freshmen get the worse ones. 2nd year ain't much better. The upper classmen dorms are the nicest or you get an apartment locally or through the university.\n\nEspecially for dining halls that cook fresh everyday, I think Case has good food. Many schools do bump up the quality of food the day high schoolers visits. The bump up between those days and the typical day at Case was not that much. Others schools can be infamous for drop off of food quality on non-visit days.\n\nCase does have four seasons of weather. August is hot and there is no AC in dorms. The fall is lovely. Case is light on the snow amounts. The snow belt is just east of campus. Spring happens with a month left in the school  year.\n\nThe lots of gray cloudy days in late fall through early spring are good for studying weather.\n\nI do have to have bitch about one type of weather. Cold rain. When it is 40 F with rain maybe a mix in of a little snow and sleet, it just sucks.  Absolutely nothing enjoyable about that.\n\nThe season change and variety of weather as a Midwestern is just something I expect. I had a boss that worked in Hawaii for a while and he said that the nice weather all year around gets old. Change of seasons is underrated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLack of school spirit. D3 sports have very minimal attendance. This is not a sports school. \n\nWhile there are some traditions, they are not really baked into the core of the school. Some of them provide social events and fun things to do, but there is no \"proud spartan\" feel nor image. \n\n \n\nAt least while I was there, there was next to none political activities and minimally functioning political clubs. Think no more than 10 members each. Case is not some activist college. If you want that go somewhere else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilar on religious front. The religious groups are small. The biggest might be 100 people roughly with a much smaller core element. Some campus ministry happens but the space is shared. This is not a major operation like at some schools with its own building for different faith traditions. For Catholics like myself, there is a full time lay minister and the local Catholic parish, Holy Rosary, is walking distance in Little Italy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDating scene in my day was not something at least in my circles did not talk about much. There was a small hookup scene maybe a hundred people. Steady couples appeared rare. Most everyone appeared to be very single. My advise: ask each other out. Go on dates. College is a get place to try dating if you did not in high school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe overall stereotype for a Case student is school focused. Many of them disappear into labs and you don't see. I would guess the main social scene at Case was only 30% of the student body. For whatever reason, people don't show up to social things at Case. Social groups can be very siloed. You have to forge friend groups. \n\nTo encourage a social scene, there is free food all over the place. One of the skills of college is finding a free meal. At Case, Friday lunch is the easiest. For any other meal, you are doing good if you can find something other than Rascal House pizza or Jimmy Johns. \n\nJoin clubs and other groups that get money from the student activity fee. Students pay a lot into the fee pool and most don't get all the value out of it. All those groups have surprising large budgets and need ideas to spend on. So, every little group with a budget can afford to give out food. \n\nA big event at Case gets 500 people to show up and those are limited to headline events. A mega event would be 1000 people. Probably, the best attend event is the Spring Comedian. Severance Hall holds up to 2,000 and the place can be mostly full depending on the act. I saw John Oliver one year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase is not a party school. There are parties, but most of them are closed friend groups. Open parties tend to be rare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I have to lament anything, it is the generally apathy of the student body. Lots of STEM dorks that don't care about the bigger things in life. People at Case take the school thing seriously and take their research seriously. Not a lot of interest in arts nor politics nor religion. It can be really sad how much of drones people at Case can be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe neighbor of University Circle is OK. Many of the various cultural attractions of Cleveland are all right around Case with free entry for Case students. If you have a light afternoon, great time to go to a museum. University Circle and Case are a bubble in town. Very different that Cleveland overall and the surrounding area. For the most part, students stay in the bubble for better or worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould you attend Case? \n\nI cannot tell you. The best you can do is visit the place while school is in session. Take the tour and get a feel of the place. \n\nThe rule of thumb for Case is the bigger the aid package, the more the admission department wants you. Basically all domestic students are getting some merit aid. International students can be paying full price. Part of the reason costs are so high is to capture rich foreign dollars. \n\nThe big thing with selecting a college between the ones that admitted you is fit. Does it feel right. Right fit helps with getting students to finish school. If you enjoy college academically and socially, odds of finishing in my opinion go up. \n\nKeeping a social life actually helps with the grades. You need to get out of the dorms / apartments and go places and do things. \n\nCase for me ended up being the right school at the time for me. I fit in socially and academically just fine.",

Where do those tuition dollars go? Stop hiring more staff and pay faculty.",

Socially, if you\u2019re introverted, you can be totally antisocial. If you\u2019re extroverted, there are plenty of extroverted people and parties to go to. Professionally this school is great, the amount of alumni that work at top companies and are willing to help you out is great, I\u2019ve gotten a lot of help from just reaching out to alumni.",

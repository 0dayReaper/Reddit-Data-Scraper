    "postText": "During slow work days when I have little else to do, I\u2019ve taken to exploring the CWRU campus and (considering how Cleveland weather tends to be intermittently unpleasant in every season) contemplating how I would connect its different buildings to each other to eliminate the need to cross between them outdoors. So, I figured I might as well \u201cliveblog\u201d the project here. Maybe people will have suggestions, be inspired, or just find it interesting.\n\nMy interest in architecture and civil engineering is a hobbyist\u2019s, starting out in video game level design (my actual education is in robotics and computer science), and I realize nothing I propose is likely to ever be seriously picked up by the university. However,  I tried to be as realistic as possible with something that could actually be built for a modest institutional budget. In any event, it\u2019s been a fun excuse to explore different parts of the school and learn more about how it is all put together.\n\nThe basic \u201crules\u201d I am holding to are as follows:\n\n* *Every university building must be accessible from any other building on campus without setting foot outside.*\n   * \u201cInside\u201d includes enclosed, but unheated structures like \tparking garages. These won\u2019t get you rained on, and are typically somewhat cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter than the actual outdoors. However, I will prefer fully-climate-controlled additions if possible.\n   * Case maintains (or *somebody* maintains) a system of \tcommuter shuttles to connect several different sections of campus that are geographically relatively distant. It is acceptable to \tconnect buildings by shuttle instead of on foot, provided that the shuttle can be boarded from a parking garage or other enclosed space. Overhanging roofs may or may not be acceptable for this purpose- I have seen enough snow storms in my time here to know what areas will or will not be made impassible.\n   * A \u201cuniversity building\u201d is one that students and/or staff study and/or work in, and is operated by Case Western Reserve. Adelbert Hall, which contains offices but no lecture halls or labs, is a \tuniversity building; but One-to-One Fitness, a private fitness center that arranges memberships through Case and is located on campus, is not. However, connections might be made on a \tcase-by-case basis to non-university buildings nearby. Examples of such buildings include RTA bus/train stops, buildings like the aforementioned One-to-One that offer some kind of service to students, or buildings associated with University Hospitals or the Cleveland Clinic, which are or were collaborating with the university.\n* As much as possible, avoid disrupting the internal structure of a building. People should not have to move their labs, offices, or lecture halls to accommodate pedestrian traffic.\n* Try for handicapped accessibility- particularly avoiding stairs and \tmaking sure there is access to elevators. Case has a lot of different buildings constructed at a lot of different times and is not itself 100% compliant on this; I don\u2019t have to *fix* places where it is not, but my additions should be.\n* Consider aesthetics of the overall campus. Don\u2019t cut down all the trees to make room for elevated bridges, or put a parking garage in the middle of the quad. This means that the \u201cprettier\u201d I think \tan area is or the more populated it tends to be, the less likely it should be to have construction destroy it.\n* Avoid, if possible, cutting off outdoor routes to and between buildings. People should not *have* to use the interior paths in nice weather, and should not be walled off from external shortcuts that previously existed.\n* Try to keep large sections on the same vertical level- instead of having to constantly go up and down stairs/elevators to get through a series of buildings.\n\nMap of current plans / progress:\n\n**1) Main Quad: 9 / 28 Buildings Accessible**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ha79rkek5ou91.jpg?width=1056&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e1d2ea0b04f1b91b7739a1a485441b2ce5be5c63\n\n# 1A \u2013 Glennan / Horsburg Elevated Bridge\n\nLet\u2019s begin on Main Campus, starting with my desk in the Glennan Building and working outward.\n\nThis campus map is actually not 100% accurate, as while it displays some connections between buildings there are others that it omits- perhaps it is intended to represent what is accessible at *ground* level? There is an unmarked underground hallway between Crawford and Tomlinson, an elevated bridge between the third floors of KH Smith and AW Smith, and another elevated bridge between the first floor of Veale Center and the third(?) floor of Richey Mixon. So I\u2019ve filled them in.\n\nThis brings us to our first actual addition- among those students and staff on the south side of the Glennan Building who are lucky enough to *have* windows, the view for many is the flat brick wall of Horsburg Gymnasium (some of the signage refers to parts of it as an extension of Veale). There really is very little distance between them, and the space is currently occupied by this weird wooden staircase thing, so I don\u2019t have much problem constructing something over, under, or on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cc3f84t3lpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a9bd2c9475ea2d3d5c293a987fcfdb177ccf78ab\n\nGlennan is already connected to Olin and White through a series of multistory glass corridors (I\u2019d call them bridges but they go all the way to the ground), as well as semi-underground hallways (the ground level on the east side of these buildings is two stories higher than on the west, so floors 1 and 2 are belowground from the main quad and aboveground from MLK). All three buildings are connected this way on the 2nd floor and the 5th floor (Olin and White are connected on *every* floor between those, as well as on the 1st, but Glennan has no underground hallway on 1, and the bridges on 3 and 4 were turned into the lobby and a lecture hall respectively). So it would be great to have the connection to Horsburg be on one of those levels, and provide a straight shot through all three engineering buildings.\n\nMy first instinct would be to build a walkway through/along the hill on Glennan\u2019s 2nd floor. The staircase (or a better-looking staircase) down the hill to the MLK parking lot could then run overtop of it. This appears to be how the existing in-the-hillside corridors between Glennan, Olin, and White were constructed, and would require little (maybe even no) digging. However, the internal layouts of both buildings are not suitable for that. The 1st and 2nd floors of Glennan both have extensive lab space facing along the south wall, while the lower floors of Horsburg (I believe they are also numbered 1 and 2) are a labyrinth of weight and training rooms as well as mechanical spaces.\n\nI also considered a shared 3rd-floor hallway. On the Glennan side, it would open out into or through what is currently a student lounge, or create a second hallway passing completely through it- which would divide it from the administrative offices that currently share a wall with the lounge. That would involve cutting out a small electronics work area that does not seem to be used (there is a much larger electronics lab right next to it), but also either part of the office space or the student section would need to be shrunk for it to fit and I\u2019d prefer not to have to do that.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1j56h2bblpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2a8dc97e317d80dc706ff762ed364d070abeb0f2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngdjodz9lpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=766a4a5c9e4840a7c14b6ad331069b391319d064\n\nOn the ground floor of Horsburg, there\u2019s this nice \u201cAll American Hallway\u201d with student tables and a bunch of athletic awards the University would probably like to show off, accessible right from the main Veale student area, leading to\u2026 a swimming pool.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hids0krhlpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fa52ea309baf4fc462b1f0a839d6b0556b378113\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvg2ckrhlpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=380ae58c5844dc58ac846751436d58a102f00233\n\nSo this probably won\u2019t work.\n\nHowever, I think it\u2019d be possible to run an elevated walkway across the upper section of the two-story-high pool room; and either through the All-American Corridor and extending off from the observation deck, or going above the entire corridor (although that latter option might be a tight squeeze with the cardio room above it).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynlvp1xylpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=417b26c847dd17caa178922c5a4464b3f0ef1e65\n\nI have Big Plans for the upper levels of these three athletic buildings, so the upper section would come in handy later. If the space over the pool *has* to be open (for instance, if those vent ducts or the diving board would get in the way), it\u2019d also be possible to run the walkway along the *outside* of the wall, connecting to the Veale main lobby, or possibly transition from inside to outside of it at the two-story atrium. Similar designs are used at the Louis Stokes VA Center and the Cleveland Clinic. I am not sure if the wall could support that weight just cantilevered out (without doing something like running girders all the way across, which would defeat the purpose of leaving the upper area clear), but if not the walkway could extend supports down to the side. There is plenty of space where there is currently a lawn and a few scraggly trees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivz5pen3mpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ad1888f55754433f329e1e64b3d111c595df5239\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tryqen3mpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=122950b1d77d594c3a37ba97cd271c8669e56166\n\nOn the Glennan end, both the fourth and fifth floors are pretty densely packed with offices (and some labs and lecture halls) on the south side. *However*, they are intermixed with these little \u201cmud room\u201d areas, where the doors to two offices will face each other with a small space in the middle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0zgk7c9mpt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=885d6a296aa2d180bab8e8e7b3f3148387c7c0b2\n\nPeople usually just put some chairs and maybe a potted plant in there, so I think they\u2019re fair game for knocking out the exterior wall and putting in a doorway to an elevated bridge. The people in those offices might not particularly like their doors opening *right* onto a main pedestrian artery; I considered just moving the doors to face directly into the hall, but while the side walls of these rooms look like just wallboard the front has a bunch of building systems (water, electric, etc) running through and so would be difficult to poke holes in. So a small amount of moving might be required. The only other real issue is that the 4th floor of Glennan is a little bit higher than the roof level of Horsburg- and the 5th floor is *much* higher. I think a handicapped-accessible ramp could make it from a reasonable second-floor level in Horsburg to the 4th floor in Glennan in the space between the two buildings, but certainly not the 5th (where it could then connect to the Glennan-White-Olin set of bridges). It *might* be possible to do this with the bridge on the outside of the wall where it could climb up and *over* the pool building, but I cannot think of a design of this that would not look ugly and overly-artsy (and would make the thing much harder to support).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmd225xempt91.jpg?width=2076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=13f1a26dbb1013463412e6a4d4e89a10cc839d12\n\nOn a side note, there is also an elaborate RTA bus stop in the parking lot down here near Richey Mixon, and a *rail* stop not far from it. I plan to revisit those if I ever examine South Campus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1B - Veale/P53 Elevated Bridge\n\nThere is, ultimately, very little distance between the Veale field house and the parking garage next to it, so putting an elevated bridge between the two seems like an obvious addition. I don\u2019t know if it would even necessarily need supports other than the walls on either end:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcaz5rigffu91.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f8f610eae43840e376567fa79f96d718846c576\n\nThis is why I was so dedicated to finding a way to connect Glennan to the *second* level of Veale/Horsburg- I can imagine a walkway going from the second level of the parking garage, above and out of the way of the indoor track in Veale (making use of these big support girders)\u2026\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gksfgjhiffu91.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4a0bec2b31a1793d81f1d153014524702f048c94\n\nand up onto this balcony (the dedicatory plaque calls it a \u201ccaptain\u2019s bridge\u201d, a term I have not heard before in an architectural context).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrjhh3kjffu91.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=db90879e066402601d9d5ea68f3d2144860668b6\n\nThis leads through a small second-floor area of athletic department offices, right to where I had previously found a starting point for the 1A Horsburg-Glennan bridge- thus, pedestrians could go right from the parking garage, through the athletic complex, and into the biggest engineering buildings.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d consider of great aesthetic value in the space between Veale and the parking garage, so I suppose the elevated walkway and bridge could be replaced with a small ground structure connecting to the blue \u201cemergency exit\u201d doors down there. However, I don\u2019t think the people trying to use the indoor track for its intended purpose would enjoy having loads of engineering students tramping back and forth across it.\n\n# 1C - P53 Shuttle Stop\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gone to so much trouble to connect (eventually all) main campus buildings to the P-53 parking garage, I might as well make it easy to *get* to by having a commuter shuttle stop there. Currently, none of the shuttles seem to actually go *onto* campus; I am not sure *why*, so this could either be the most realistic and cost-effective, or most *un*realistic part of my plan depending on what the reason actually is. It might just be because most of the existing stops aren\u2019t really next to roadways that *lead* onto the quad.\n\nMy original plan was to put the shuttle stop all the way inside the parking garage up to the second floor, right next to the planned terminus of the Veale bridge. However, a modification of the curbs to add a stop in the little overhang area in the very front (possibly adding on some more cheap tubestock-and-plexiglas extension to the arch) would work just as well from a not-getting-wet perspective, while decreasing the shuttle\u2019s impact on within-garage traffic and making it more accessible to pedestrians *not* coming from the bridge.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmrtohapffu91.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=796cc94f296d3af822851cc4a9babdaa52574e3b\n\n# 1D \u2013 White/ Bingham Elevated Bridge\n\nThis extremely obvious path from White to Bingham that I go past nearly every day, was one of the things that first got me thinking about connecting campus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kxwxpcq26ou91.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5728a9adb3f72ee569d01a3bf8a90fada85d31af\n\nI think the best place to enclose it would be just underground, on White\u2019s second floor and Bingham\u2019s basement. There\u2019s a student area right there on the Bingham side, with an elevator and stairwell right nearby.\n\nMuch of the west-facing side of White is occupied on floors 1 and 2 by a big two-story metal foundry complex. So this would *seem* to be a nonstarter. *But*, a little ways further on, in the hallway between White and Olin, there\u2019s actually a section of preexisting underground construction extending out towards the west.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fd9jpjc6ou91.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dc8115905556831ca9712d017fea3def153e2e06\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hda6iqjc6ou91.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=535660607ce821f8019471a7daaa1eb1cb4a46b8\n\nThis area (it\u2019s referred to on signage as part of Olin) has been marked as \u201cfuture home of the Great Lakes Energy Institute\u201d for quite a while now, with no signs of renovation or the GLEI moving out of its current location on Olin 3rd floor. I am not quite sure how far out west it *goes*, but I\u2019d guess parallel with either the front of White or the front of Olin. That makes it just as good a starting place for a Bingham tunnel as any other portion of White or Olin. Most of the interior construction also appears to be just drywall, so it should be easy to move around.\n\nAn elevated bridge *could* also reach from the walkways connecting White-Olin or Glennan-White, to one of the upper floors of Bingham. The best place to connect it would probably be the same stairwell that is reachable through that exterior door on the ground level, as the landings are relatively wide. However, while there is some unused space on Bingham\u2019s upper floors, it\u2019s mostly labs and classrooms; and an elevated walkway would need to be longer than the tunnel and drop supports down to ground level.",

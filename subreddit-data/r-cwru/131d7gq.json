I got enough money from all that it isn\u2019t a determining factor and wanted to know what people think of the school, if they would pick it again, and if they have any insight into my decision that I haven\u2019t considered yet? Thanks!!",

But in summary, case is a great place to do premed due to the amount of research, volunteer, and leadership opportunity with a flexible schedule",

It will be as challenging as Stevens Institute of Technology\n\nCWRU literally has hospitals next door so it is easy to volunteer with out worrying about transport.\n\nCWRU has a medical school so knows what it takes to get into med school.\n\nCWRU has a more balanced Male/Female ratio (53/47 vs 71/29)\n\nBoth are in urban areas.\n\nDon't know where you live but you can fly to Cleveland and take a train to campus so it is fairly easy to get to.",

Like if you coudl do an honors thesis would you do one? If you could learn overseas would you take advantage of that?\n\n3) How close are hospitals and the like to volunteer at? How many other colleges have students that would also volunteer?  E.g., are all the harvard pre-meds also trying to get to Mass General as well?\n\n4) How convenient are both to where you live?\n\n5) What major are you thinking of?\n\n6) Northeastern has 3 times as many undergrads as CWRU... do you think that is goo or bad?\n\n7) How is housing? Case guarantees 2 years and most likely you could get 2 more. What about Northeaster?",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI got my case card photo approved today and I should be able to submit my housing application. I've got two questions:\n\n1. I am a citizen but have no driver's license, military license, or state ID. What do I do about the case card banking? I am a 17 year old turning 18 in the fall, so are my guardians supposed to fill that out for me?\n2. My photo was approved today so I should be able to apply four housing. Right now, only the card is on the checklist. Is this the wrong page?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4b47au18g5ya1.png?width=1530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=98aaa501f043663b4692789102b76199c2632dcd\n\nAny help appreciated, thank you.",

In general you should get a state id, you\u2019ll need a photo id with your age on it for more things than you think (for example, cough syrup if you get sick)",

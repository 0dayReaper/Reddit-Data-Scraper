Bothe are great schools for STEM. Apart from academics, what you will get are two totally different college experiences. Notre Dame is more of a social, party school than Case, but it\u2019s in a small town. Case gives you an urban, larger city atmosphere with tons of unique and exciting things to do and see around Cleveland. Academically, you can\u2019t go wrong, but consider what else you find important in a college experience! Feel free to DM me as well!",

Case is definitely still \u2018well-rounded\u2019 as we do have excellent humanities/arts department (and many of those will let you register courses even if you aren\u2019t a declared major/minor). You can also easily declare a humanities minor if you\u2019re interested. Overall, I think the EE department is also pretty strong, especially if you want to get into Bio-medical engineering. Feel free to PM me if you want more info.",

Don't stress, you literally can't go wrong... \n\nI graduated a while ago, but started as a bio major for 2 years, wasn't into it, switched, and graduated in 4 years with majors in finance and economics. Had a great experience. I was also not from the area and really surprised at the incredible amount of cool stuff to do both on and off campus. Love Cleveland am surprised at how many friends from undergrad moved back to the CLE. \n\nI think, traditionally, Case has had a very strong STEM background and graduate programs, which can make those not as familiar focus on that, but it's a very good school across just about every deptartment.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you've got some more questions.",

Specifically ECSE 371 if you are interested in analog electronics and systems. \n\nAssuming Larry is still teaching that course in 3-4 years he will whip you in to shape whether you like it or not.\n\nThe digital sides of EE is a bit less supported but that's uninteresting stuff anyways :)",

            "comment": "Both are solid options. It really comes down to how you fit within the school environment. Like most people echoed, Case is a lot smaller and laid back in terms of the social scene compared to Notre Dame. Case typically has smaller class sizes but Notre Dame will have a greater variety of classes in your major compared to Case. At Case it's going to be much easier for you to gain access to research, internships, and fieldwork given the emphasis on hands-on learning at this school compared to Notre Dame. But at Notre Dame there you would get stronger alumni connections compared to Case.\n\nIt's a stereotype that Case isn't well rounded. While the overall student and research vibe is much more stem oriented, some of the best professors and favorite classes I've had at this school are outside stem. I can say if you want to explore options outside of stem, there are solid options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can confidently say a CWRU education is worth it",

            "comment": "Case has a great BME program with a lot of resources. One thing to be cautious of with BME (in general not just at Case) is that it can be a bit harder to get jobs because it\u2019s kind of a jack of all trades major. You learn some mechE, some EE, some CS, etc. on top of the BME specific material. Makes you well rounded, but not as specialized as someone who just focused on one area. Some companies would rather take the straight up mechE, EE, CS majors over the BME major since they have more depth in their specific area. That\u2019s why a lot of BME students get masters degrees to stay competitive. And if you ever want to switch into a non-health related field, a more broad engineering major like EE might make it easier. With that said, I think it\u2019s still a really cool major and Case BME students still get jobs, so if you really like that major, I say go for it.",

            "comment": "\nGreat major, great curriculum, great research opportunities at Case for BME. Absolutely no complaints. Hit the ground running and try to get into a research lab within your first year by emailing professors. It isn't super difficult, and some will pay. You can have a few publications to show by the time you graduate. \n\n\nI echo what the other people said -- graduate degrees are usually recommended for BMEs. Fortunately, Case has the 4+1 Masters program (which I'm pretty sure you can make 3+1 if you overload on undergrad credits). If you build relevant research experience in one area, it can also mitigate the need for a graduate degree.\n\n\nI'd also recommend taking CSDS 132 and the required PHYS courses your first year -- it gets difficult to balance the workload from these courses once you start taking EBME 201 and 202 in your second year. Feel free to ask any other questions you may have :)",

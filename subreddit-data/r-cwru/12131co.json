Last semester I had a A, but it just randomly got so much more difficult this semester. I\u2019m really worried because my teacher doesn\u2019t give much opportunity to gain more points.",

Did you not practice those problems? Did you not read that section?\n\n2) Use any teacher office hours that might be available\n\n3) Form a study group \n\n4) get a tutor \n\n5) Watch videos on Khan Academy \n\n6) Do extra practice problems",

There\u2019s no way to say if that will affect you, but people have had their offers rescinded due to low grades.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a high school senior planning on majoring in physics and minoring in cs with the goal of pursuing astrophysics eventually. obviously case is great from a stem standpoint. however, i\u2019m also really into both english and music, and want to be able to explore those in some depth throughout college (not to the point of a minor but like more than one class of each yk). i was scrolling through the sample physics major schedule and it seems like it\u2019s just major requirements all the time, with an elective like one semester a year until you get to senior year. would i end up just doing stem stuff 24/7, or is there an opportunity to explore non major related subjects? \n\nless related to the title, but what are chorus opportunities like at case? how hard is it to get into the concert choir/a capella groups?",

I'm pretty sure it's still the same now for all the STEM majors. One elective my senior year convinced me that I should actually be going to law school instead of becoming an engineer. So I did that instead. It's worked out really well.",

            "comment": "There is a lot of opportunity to explore other subjects, as even though some of the STEM majors have a ton of requirements there are very few requirements outside of that. \n\nAs for choir stuff: I\u2019m currently in the concert choir and it\u2019s very easy to get into, auditions were super quick and low-pressure, the basic requirement is that u can sing on-key and sight read at least a tiny bit. The director\u2019s pretty great and we sing a lot of fun pieces. Additionally there are the Case Glee Club (low voices) and University Chorale (treble voices) that are non-auditioned ensembles that are pretty good too. As for student-run a-capella groups we\u2019ve got Case In Point (traditional pop-style a-capella group) and Dhamacapella (south-Asian-pop-fusion) that are both pretty high level, and they\u2019re both actually headed to ICCA semifinals in St. Louis this weekend. All of these music ensembles are very welcoming and easy to balance alongside other school stuff and clubs.",

They really want you to take what interests you.\n\nFor choirs, there are a lot of options. The music department has ensembles, but there are also a few other groups (Case Glee Club, Dhamakapella, Case in Point, and Solstice). They vary in selectivity, but definitely lots of opportunities.",

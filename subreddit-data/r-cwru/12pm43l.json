    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am HS senior trying to decide between UCSB (in-state), CWRU (got a huge scholarship that makes it cheaper than UW) and UW (OOS). I'm planning to pursue the premed track. How easy is it to get the courses I want (Gen Chem &amp; Gen Bio) in freshman year at CWRU? Is there grade deflation at CWRU? How are the professors for Gen Chem &amp; Gen Bio (heard that these are weeder classes)? Cost isn't a factor between these universities. I have visited UCSB and UW campuses and am visiting CWRU today. Loved both the campuses so far (UCSB &amp; UW). Appreciate any insights that you can give me.",

Generally Gen Bio and Gen Chem are weeder classes at all all universities if you\u2019re doing pre-med, but if you did both subjects in highschool you should be fine. Even more so if you did AP or the IB in these subjects. At CWRU grade deflation is not a concern, if anything there is grade inflation since there aren\u2019t +/- for letter grades.",

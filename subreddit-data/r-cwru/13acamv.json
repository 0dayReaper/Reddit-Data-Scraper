    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman and I was wondering what's the best way to get a good housing arrangement. I hope it's okay to ask questions and confirm a couple of things.\n\nThe housing form opens on June 1, right? From what I can tell, it seems like Juniper is the best house for me. I'd really prefer to be in a single room, hopefully in Juniper, but is this feasible? I hear there aren't that many singles and choosing a room can be competitive. What are my chances? Are there any tips and tricks to getting your preferred room choice? Is it better if I just say I want a single in any of the houses instead of going for Juniper?\n\nShould I prepare to have a roommate in advance in case I don't get a single? If so, is it too late for me to go roommate hunting? I'm not super well-versed in that kind of thing. I hear there are Facebook groups I should join or something like that. Are there other methods?\n\nThank you! Sorry for all the questions. I'm not sure if things like this have been asked already. I'd appreciate any advice I can get!",

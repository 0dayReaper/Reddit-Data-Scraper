    "postText": "Hello fellow case westerners. I'm likely matriculating at Case med next fall and am curious about how hooping is on campus and beyond. For context, I went to a D1 state school in Alabama, with awesome recreational facilities, then transferred to Emory, which as a D3 school had just enough (several indoor basketball courts). Their rec center hosted pretty much every club and D3 sport, so courts and other parts of the building were occupied somewhat frequently. I imagine that Case leans more towards Emory as far as what they offer, but I am still interested in knowing your experience as hoopers. Maybe we'll play 5vs5 this fall :)",

            "comment": "The indoor fieldhouse at Veale (main athletic center) has 4 courts. Usually open for pickup but sometimes reserved for other clubs (badminton, volleyball, etc). Pickup gets a good mix of undergrad and grad students.\n\nAdelbert gym is also open at odd hours.\n\nIM basketball is open to grad students and is fairly competitive.\n\nThere are also a few outdoor courts on and around campus, some are open to CWRU students only and some to the general public.",

Most med students live off-campus and don't participate in the intramural sports offered at Case undergraduate. The med school offers student orgs and clubs. You are welcome to participate in intramural sports at Veale Center or Adelbert gym. There are basketball courts at both facilities.\n\n I have not observed many med students involved in intramurals. Med school gets busy and involved. also, most med students purchase a membership to one-to-one fitness or have private gym memberships. The hours at Veale center aren't suitable on weekends.",

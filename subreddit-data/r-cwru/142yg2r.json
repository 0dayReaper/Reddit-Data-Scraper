            "comment": "Get to CLE on Thursday or Friday, 2/3 days before orientation (1 day before move-in) if you have the means to pay for a hotel room. Courtyard by Marriott on Cornell is convenient but gets booked early by CWRU community. There is a shuttle for Holiday Inn at Cleveland Clinic (and you can walk it too). Glidden House is right next to freshman dorms but $$$ and heavily booked. Google CWRU Travel to get booking discount codes and check the hotel for check-in policy for under 18s.\n\nGive yourself time to adjust for jet lag, if applicable. You want to be \"present\" during the orientation. If you come from Asia, it's much harder to adjust to Eastern Standard Time than the other way. \n\nThere are Case shopping shuttles to Target to get things for your dorm room. Or carpool an Uber/Lyft or hitch a ride with your roommate's parent (and if you ask, they won't mind picking things up for you during their shopping runs). \n\nOpen a bank account at the PNC Bank mobile van right behind Tinkham Veale so you have a local bank account. For initial cash, it's better to get USD from a local ATM instead of money exchanger, assuming you'll have an ATM/debit card that works on US ATM networks (MOST, PLUS, etc. If your foreign debit card is Visa or Master, then it will work). You'll get much better exchange rate from a local ATM even after including the ATM fees.",

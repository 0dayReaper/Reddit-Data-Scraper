            "comment": "Depends, are you using it strictly for note taking / homework? Then you\u2019d want a laptop that has decent specs(but not overkill), weighs a good amount so you can easily carry it from class to class, and a good battery life so you don\u2019t have to carry around a charger. If you\u2019re looking to also game on it, get a gaming laptop. It\u2019s really heavy and relatively expensive, so obviously only buy one if you\u2019re looking for a multipurpose gaming laptop. If it\u2019s the former, here are the ideal specs\n\n(Note taking and hw purposes only) :\nCPU: Intel i5 or Ryzen 5 (bit older gen chips but they\u2019ll serve you just fine (especially ryzen 5600x) \nGPU: ideally a laptop with a 1070 or above (I don\u2019t use ryzen gpu so I don\u2019t know much about that) \nRam: I personally prefer 32 GB, 16 is ok but for future proofing I\u2019d honestly look for a 32 GB if it\u2019s in your budget\nGood battery life and light weight. You\u2019re not going to achieve all of these criteria, so you\u2019ll have to sacrifice some things. HP and Dell make decent laptops for their price (usually $700) \n\nFor gaming and note taking / hw purposes:\nThe same things I\u2019ve said above still apply, just a few minor adjustments. You\u2019d want a better gpu than a 1070, honestly a lot of gaming laptops on the market have 30 series cards anyways so you might as well just go for those. MSI makes pretty good laptops, though they are expensive and heavy. You could also check Lenovo. \n\nIn the end though, it really doesn\u2019t matter that much because VS code works for mac and windows anyways. Just get a laptop that\u2019s good for its price and fits your needs. Read customer reviews and watch YouTube videos on those laptops. Good luck hunting.",

You just have to triple check that you followed all the tiny rules. For example, he bans the use of constants (besides stuff like 1 or 0), so everything needs to be a named value instead. It\u2019s easy to miss one and get marked down, my advice is to ctrl+F on every digit 2-9 once you\u2019re done coding. He\u2019s super responsive to email, almost obsessively quick to reply sometimes lmao.\n\nBut yeah I got like 97% in the class or something stupid lol. Tons of extra credit opportunities, the tests are so easy they basically don\u2019t exist (in my opinion). The lectures can be a tad stale, but he\u2019s a very interesting teacher so it\u2019s easier to pay attention than most other classes.",

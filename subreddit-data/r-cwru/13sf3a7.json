    "postText": "Im an incoming freshman and as an intl, im kinda kinda confused about this. \nI see everybody asking around for a roommate, am I recommended to find one too? Will the university group me with some random person if I dont choose one? Also, if I end up choosing a roommate, how can I inform the university that I want this person as my roommate? And what happens on the roommate selection on june 1st? \n\nOn the same topic, for a biosys major, which dorm would be best? I'd like a newer dorm and good facilities, near to the cafeteria maybe? \n\nThanks for any help and advice",

Once you fill in the first forms you can go in and request a roommate. Saw this in the portal.\n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal if you don\u2019t find someone. They will put you with someone if you don\u2019t. \n\nThere is an online video and descriptions that describes the housing options. They are not new but in varying states of having updates including furniture and none of freshman dorms have air condition. They are in sane general area. There are quad type and hall type and descriptions of this. Clarke is one people tend to complain more about. \n\nGood luck.",

But we just put each other\u2019s case ids in the roommate section on the housing portal. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say any dorm is better for any major. The freshman dorms are all in the same general area. If you get lucky, Triangle and STJ are apartments (full kitchen) and they sometimes put overflow freshman there, but it\u2019s not in northside residential village (freshman dorm area). Juniper is newer/bigger but a tiny bit farther from the others (closer to Mather quad). Cedar magnolia is older/dirtier but quad style and close to leutner (dining hall). Mistletoe is pretty nice and close to the exit for nrv (so closer to classes/main quad). Also pretty close to leutner. Clarke is old and very tall so it sucks if the elevator breaks, but a lot of people like the suite style.",

This is your best bet for quality of life, as the furniture, closet space, room space, are all better. \nHowever if you can\u2019t get any of these dorms, I\u2019d go with Mistletoe (Raymond, Sherman, Norton, Tyler) just for the location. These are the closest dorms to your classes (albeit not by much), Leutner and Den (dining), Starbucks, and Wade (packages, study area, etc).",

Then, the program will make suggestions for people who match up with you on the my housing portal. You can see these people when you click on the room selection tab at the top. You can message back and forth on the portal with people that sound good based on those questions and additional comments you can make about yourself on the application. You can then select to form a housing group. If you don\u2019t form a group, you can just ask the school to match you based on matching lifestyle criteria.",

I believe you can fill out a short survey in the housing app and it will show you people who are \u201cmatches.\u201d You can contact them, or you can select a room when room selection opens and have someone random. That is my understanding anyway. Or you could try to find a roommate through social media. I believe later this week housing selection opens",

I am not sure how you then find matches but my kid was able to figure it out. You can then contact each person that\u2019s a match.

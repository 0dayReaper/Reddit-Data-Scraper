I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s an academically challenging school and I\u2019m down for that. I\u2019m also not American and have no interest in the traditional college experience. I wanna go to a place focused on academics but where I can also meet like minded people who are chill and all. I like drinking and smoking but partying ain\u2019t my thing. I would really appreciate if anyone could help explain to me a bit what it\u2019s like. Thanks\n\nEdit: Also what are the RA opportunities for 2nd year onward?",

And you definitely don\u2019t need to join one to have a good time, although many people (like me) don\u2019t go in expecting to be involved in Greek life and then are. So keep an open mind.",

Any more info would be helpful. \n.\n.\nPS: I completed my BE in Electrical and electronics engineering in 2020 and worked as a backend developer for 2 years at a startup in India. I got admitted into a hybrid course at CWRU where I will be taking first semester till Jan 2024 from India and move to USA in Jan 2024. Will this mode effect in any way?\nMy main motive is to get some good education and find internships/job early on.\nThis program is costing me 45K for tution. What might be my living expenses in total for moderate living.",

It's been almost 4 weeks, and Case is one of my top choices, but I have a deadline go enroll somewhere else this month, so I was just wondering from your previous experiences how long does it usually take.",

I've talked with both admissions and financial aid people at CWRU and my experience is that they can't/won't answer questions at best and just give straight up wrong info at worst. If you haven't received a rejection, don't count yourself out.\n\nCase has been having issues with matriculating way too many students, which I take to mean that their projections about how many students will accept an offer of admission are lower than reality, leading to an unprecedented number of undergrads. I suspect they might wait for transfer decisions until they know how many students will be entering in the fall as freshman (and how many they lose to transfers for whatever year you're applying for).",

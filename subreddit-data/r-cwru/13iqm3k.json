    "postText": "Hi everyone! Like it says in the title, I\u2019m a female transfer student starting my sophomore year at case this fall. I don\u2019t know anyone here yet, so I\u2019m still looking for a roommate/group.\n\nI\u2019ll be living in second-year housing, and am an Electrical engineering major. I\u2019m not a smoker and would prefer to not having smoking roommates. Room would ideally be a chill social space most of the time but I\u2019m flexible. Im pretty neat/tidy and keep my stuff clean, and I keep to myself for the most part unless we vibe.\n\nInterests: I like listening to/talking about music (Taylor Swift, Bleachers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eminem, Miranda Lambert to name a few). I also like playing guitar (I play unplugged though so it won\u2019t be loud) and any other instrument I can get my hands on. Love fishing and being outdoors in general. Not currently a gym rat but would love to get more into working out.\n\nIf you\u2019re interesting in being roommates/in a group or even just friends, don\u2019t hesitate to PM me.\n\nThanks y\u2019all",

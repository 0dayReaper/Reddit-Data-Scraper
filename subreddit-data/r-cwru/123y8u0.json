    "postText": "I recently got accepted, and if I attended, I would be double majoring in International Studies and Theatre. From what I can tell, these majors are ranked fairly highly at CWRU, but the impression that I've gotten is that Case is primarily a STEM focused school. In addition, I heard that the course load was fairly rigorous as well.\n\nCan any students give me insight into the humanities experience at Case Western? It would help a lot.",

            "comment": "I know a couple IS people and from what I hear it is a pretty well rounded major, with history, polisci, economics, language, etc. Personally the only humanities course I've taken was a history course (science in western thought 1), which was a great class. I haven't heard anything about our theatre program though sorry. Although case is a primarily stem school we do have good humanities/social sci programs from what I hear.",

            "comment": "Not fully humanities, but I studied Econ and Sociology but I also took some math/cs for a minor. I think some of the benefits of humanities / social science relative to the stem programs is that you\u2019re gonna see relatively smaller classes that are more focused on discussion / seminar oriented. I personally really liked this bc I like being involved instead of sitting through a lecture. Also in my experience I found that the sociology profs here are fantastic. They are really flexible and open with their students. I felt I had more of a mutual peer to peer relationship with my soc profs than I did Econ and CS. Another upside to humanities here is that if you\u2019re getting a BA, you don\u2019t have to take many credits to graduate (I think around 90 for most programs). This gives you a lot of flexibility to pursue other interests, whether it be a double minor or a second major, it\u2019s very possible to do without overworking yourself.\n\nI think the main downside with humanities here (and maybe this is an issue with humanities at all schools) is that there is little professional help. It\u2019s not like the sociology department has a career center that\u2019s plugging you in to job/internship opportunities. Sometimes the profs will have some knowledge on what\u2019a available but most of the time you\u2019ll have to do that digging yourself. Furthermore, if you want to study humanities here, you should have a pretty good idea of what you want to do post-grad. If you come out of school with an I-R and theater degree that\u2019s great\u2014 but what do you want to do with it? That\u2019s a question that\u2019s often a little harder to answer and won\u2019t necessarily get easier during your 4 years here. Regardless the humanities are great! And I certainly can say I really enjoyed studying sociology here",

However, I\u2019ve heard from a bunch of people in the humanities that a lot of stem people, especially engineers and premeds, can be kind of condescending. Ive heard that they make other people feel like their major isn\u2019t as good an engineer\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily ill intentioned but it\u2019s definitely a thing. Being an engineer, I try to not be like that but I would never know if I rubbed off of someone the wrong way. Im sure this is true at many universities, but with Case being so stem heavy it probably shows a little more.",

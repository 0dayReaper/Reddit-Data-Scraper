So you get people majoring in the liberal arts, nursing, business, as well as engineering. Unlike some engineering schools, you get more of a male female balance.\n\nCase also has a  **Single Door admissions** policy\u2026once you are admitted you can major in whatever you want\u2026no applying to the engineering or business school or whatever\u2026so you can also easily change majors (obviously you need to meet the requirements)\n\nCase is in the **University Circle**, Home to world-renowned museums, prestigious universities, nationally recognized hospitals, Cleveland Orchestra, eclectic restaurants, beautiful parks, and cozy spaces.[https://www.universitycircle.org/ ](https://www.universitycircle.org/)\n\nCase is minutes from downtown **Cleveland** and you get a free RTA pass[https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/case-western-reserve-university/2080977-cleveland.html 1](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/case-western-reserve-university/2080977-cleveland.html)\n\nCase is known for  **Merit Scholarships**\n\n[http://money.com/money/5636111/best-colleges-for-merit-aid-2019 ](http://money.com/money/5636111/best-colleges-for-merit-aid-2019)\n\nCase is affiliated with the  **Cleveland Institute of Music and the Cleveland Institute of Art**. All art programs are considerably enhanced by close cooperation with and access to the facilities of cultural institutions located in University Circle, in particular The Cleveland Museum of Art, The Cleveland Institute of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland.The Department of Music at [CWRU](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/case-western-reserve-university/154) offers undergraduate students a wide range of opportunities for musical study and participation, many of which take advantage of our Joint Music Program with the Cleveland Institute of Music. [https://music.case.edu/prospective-undergraduate-students/general-information/](https://music.case.edu/prospective-undergraduate-students/general-information/)\n\nThere is no issue getting **housing**  on campus, or off.[https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/case-western-reserve-university/2081572-cwru-frequently-asked-questions.html#1 ](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/case-western-reserve-university/2081572-cwru-frequently-asked-questions.html#1)\n\nCase has the **think\\[box\\] Maker Space** \\*ThinkBox at Case is 50,000 square feet of space for engineers, business majors and patent attorneys to come together to innovate. I think this is unique, even [MIT](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/580) does not offer this cross section of resources in one place, the maker space, the business partners and the attorneys all for you to invent, prototype patent and launch a start up while an undergrad or grad student or MBA student at Case Western. Watch the students talk about it on this video:[http://thinkbox.case.edu ](http://thinkbox.case.edu/)\n\nCase will support you if you are more into the practical **Co-op** or more theoretical  **research**.

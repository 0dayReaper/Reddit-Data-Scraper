    "postText": "Hi, I am a high school senior who has recently been accepted off of the waitlist for CWRU and now has a few days to pick between committing to CWRU or Rutgers New Brunswick. I am from NJ so Rutgers would be instate for me with a tuition cost (with dorm) of 30k. For CWRU I received a 27k scholarship which brings my cost for tuition (and dorm) to around 60k. I am looking at doing premed at both these schools and eventually med school so I was wondering which would be more worth it.\n\nI have read many posts of others saying that for the money, CWRU is not that much better than Rutgers and that I should save money for med school. However, I find that the smaller class sizes of CWRU may give me more opportunities for volunteering and research. I don't mind the distance - I am simply concerned about the money and if CWRU will really impact my chances at getting into a med school.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is if I go to Rutgers, my parents may be able to help out with a lot of the tuition cost which I cannot say the same for CWRU. I have gotten many mixed responses from people and am really torn between the two schools (especially since almost all of my high school peers are going to Rutgers so it could be cool to start fresh in CWRU?).\n\nAny advice will be helpful and thanks for reading :)",

The opportunities for research here are unequivocally more accessible and higher quality than at Rutgers. Remember that research is not only available at CWRU \u2014 a lot of students research at Cleveland Clinic (#2 hospital in the world blah blah) and University Hospitals as well. Everyone I know has research with at least one of the three, and it\u2019s usually paid and/or can lead to your name on a paper. \n\n\nOpportunities for research at Case are *not* overstated. In fact, I think students criminally underuse our school\u2019s greatest strength by not participating in research. Especially for STEM.",

But the reality is, if you believe you can find these resources at Rutgers (research, clinical hours, premed environment, etc.) then saving a significant sum of money *is* worth it. Case undoubtedly makes it easier -- we have three hospitals within walking distance, solid research, and professors aren't afraid to take undergrads under their wing. \n\n\nThe reality is: these things aren't wholly unique to Case. I don't know much about Rutgers, but these resources *will* be available there as well, albeit harder to find. My advice is: don't base your decision too deeply on how you'll pay for medical school just yet -- **a lot** of premeds leave the track when they realize they have other passions. \n\n\nEnd of day, CWRU itself will not get you into medical school. If you're driven, you'll be able to get in from either university. Case may make it a bit easier, but the \"impact\" you mention will depend on your own effort. I'm sure you'll do equally well at both universities :) Make the choice that feels best for you, and feel free to ask questions if you have any.",

    "postText": "Why is Case disliked so much despite its great ranking? I have been curious on this for a long time but ignored it. Now that I have got an MSBA admit from Case Western Reserve University and awaiting admits from other two, I wanted to know this. Despite all three of them being in Ohio State, why is Case western hated so much and University of Cincinnati or Ohio State University is liked so much (relatively). I have read many posts on reddit for the dislike on Case and most of the replies include the reason that its in Ohio/Cleveland. But what I see, all three of them are from Ohio State. Please share some opinions on this. Thank you in advance",

I don\u2019t think its inaccurate to say that the majority of students like it here. \n\n\nVocal minorities will speak out, especially online. Given it\u2019s ranking, Case unfortunately gets a lot of the \u201ci-should-be-at-an-ivy\u201d crowd that talk about transferring in orientation week, never attempting to give the school a fair shot. Ironically, they\u2019re usually the students that end up doing the poorest academically when they realize the curriculum here isn\u2019t \u201cT50.\u201d\n\n\nMiserable students will stay miserable, unfortunately. I think you\u2019d be happy here if you had an open mind.",

Sorry to hear it seems you have come across folks who 'dislike' the University, but that certainly has not been my experience both as a student there, and now in my professional life.\n\nOSU and Cincinnati are very large public universities with &gt;40k students each, with a sizable majority of each being undergraduates, and large/well-known sports programs and huge alumni networks. The academic quality is good, though with so many students, you'll find a decent amount of variability.\n\nCWRU is a medium-sized private university with &lt;15k students, about half of them undergraduates and half of them graduate/professional students. The academic quality is high and some of the graduate/professional programs (and potential employers) that you have access to are really among the best in the country.\n\nPersonally, I loved being at Case Western and in Cleveland! The orchestra is one of the world's best, incredible museums, Cleveland Clinic just down the street, there's a beautiful lake and parks system, and Cleveland has a fascinating and rich history. I'm grateful to have met some of my closest friends there, in a nice academic environment with lots of resources that helped me launch to a great career so far. I finished undergrad &gt;10 years ago, and since then, there are so many new and exciting things in University Circle.",

There's some other common complaints (e.g. food, terrible dorms, etc.) but I've seen this same sentiment on nearly every college subreddit.

I think a lot of students at Case do like to hate joke about Case but if you sit down and talk seriously with them they do like Case. It's just a weird culture that people jump on. But also, I'm a student worker in the Office of Undergrad Studies here and ngl a lot of people transfer to ivy league or T20 schools in their first or second years, maybe cuz they were rejected from these schools. The ones who stay have better things to say about Case.",

But dental school is another story where the experience at every school is the same, and that's why people don't think Case is worth it. Most people apply to Case only caring to know whether they could get accepted, but attending was never the intention.\n\nCase seems to give good scholarships for college, and I got a decent offer from them when I applied to colleges. The scholarship made it only about 5k more expensive per year than my state school, although I still declined their offer. I applied to Case for college only because they sent me something in the mail saying the application fee is free, otherwise I never heard of Case before then. Nobody in my high school ever spoke of Case, but they hyped up schools like Northwestern and Notre Dame.",

I went to ohio public uni system (admittedly went to good private high school though and know peers who went to case) and believe private colleges are for the most part a rip-off unless you have major scholarship. \n\nMy first job out of college I was working with people who went to Case, OSU, John Carroll, Cleveland State\u2014the only thing that differentiated us was the amount of student debt held.",

It's costing me approx 72k per year(includes 14k living) and the course being 18 months long is not helping with the expected debt I'm gonna land. However I was curious and the thread gave so many new perspectives. Thanks for this insight. I'll keep this in mind for the final decision for sure.",

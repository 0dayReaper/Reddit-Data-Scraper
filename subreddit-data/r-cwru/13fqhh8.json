            "comment": "On campus it\u2019s pretty safe, the alerts are mostly off campus nearby but we also are located near East Cleveland which is known as the more dangerous part of the city. I definitely have never felt unsafe merely for being a woman while on campus. I would suggest being careful/taking a friend when going off campus though because the city can be dangerous and definitely think twice before going into the city at night. I am about to finish my first year and I\u2019ve only been harassed once at the bus station. But yeah I even feel pretty safe at night when I am on campus, I just stay vigilant because since we are also near UH there can be some interesting mfs. Usually the majority of the crimes are muggings I\u2019m pretty sure",

Hope you guys can get it overthrown (maybe via UGA?) asap. \n\nOur Ohio neighbors OSU and CSU don't have this rule; universities like NYU, UCLA, Yale \u2014 all located in States with much stricter weapon policy \u2014 don't have such a policy as well. Yet none of them had any issue. This is really putting liability concerns beyond students' well-being.",

Case has security guards walking around campus after it gets dark out. They also have a free ride share app called safe ride where you can be transported from one place on campus to another from 6 pm - 3 am. There\u2019s also a campus police building near the freshman dorms and it\u2019s common to see university circle/cuyahoga police on busy streets.",

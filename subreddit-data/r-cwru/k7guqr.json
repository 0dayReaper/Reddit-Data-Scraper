If they still keep up the same practices, they'll put you in an orientration group of about 10 and a larger social group of about 1/3 of your class. At least during your first year, those groups will meet regularly for drinks and such, and can tend to turn into ad hoc study groups.\n\nThere's always /r/lawschool, but don't take it too seriously, it tends to have a lot of negative nancies who are overly obsessed with school ranking (Aggressive defense of their life choices).",

If you meant the latter, you can start with this spreadsheet that they update every semester listing open positions: [source list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvPtaYDeavYkm1cwj9UOHXPArMjm66CO/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=107294869596237278490&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true). There are definitely open positions not on this list though. \n\nIf this doesn't work, you can try cold emailing professors whose research you're interested in. With cold emailing, you'll probably have to reach out to more than one person, but I know that cold emailing has worked for people. When emailing a professor for research, briefly introduce yourself (name, major, year) and why you're interested in their lab. Try to make your reason for wanting to join their lab not super general. To help with this, I would also skim some of their previous papers. You don't need to understand everything, but you should have a basic understanding of what kind of research they do. If they respond and are interested in you, they'll probably ask for a resume and a short 1 on 1 meeting with you. I was able to get my research position by attending a research fair in Thwing that I found out about in an email.\n\nIf you meant independent research, I\u2019m not too sure about that. I think some departments offer a course for independent research, but not sure on the specifics. I would ask your advisor about it.",

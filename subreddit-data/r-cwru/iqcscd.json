The changing of the branding by the university itself to just Case is what upset a lot of alumni from the Western Reserve schools and colleges. When I was studying you could still find the old \"fat man and surfboard\" logo in the odd spot, but I wasn't aware of the controversy around it until I heard about it from much older grads.",

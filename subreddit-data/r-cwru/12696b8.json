    "postText": "Hello,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no clue whether this is the right platform to do so, but I am looking for a last-minute 9-person group willing to have me with them for the lottery for something in the village. I am an engineering-physics major in my second year. I am quiet and out most of the time out of the room, and I would love to get to know a bunch of new people. I can introduce myself better if someone from that group would be willing to DM me. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers.",

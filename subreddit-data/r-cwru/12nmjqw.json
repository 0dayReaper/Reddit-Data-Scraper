    "postText": "Hey, I'm from NJ intending to major in CS. Highly considering Case as an option, but I want some more insight from some current Case students on the school. \n\n1. How's the workload in CS? Obviously it won't be easy but do you still have time to have a life outside of class and participate in clubs / research opportunities? \n2. How has everyone found Cases network for landing internships / jobs? I heard from a friend it is mostly Ohio based which could be rough for me since I'm from NJ. I got into Purdues cyber security major which has a more national network and RPI's CS program which is more east coast based, so I'm wondering if Case is the best school to set me up for the future. Any input on how career fairs / building your resume and network at case work would be greatly appreciated. \n3. Case is honestly the most expensive school I've been accepted to. The estimated cost they gave me comes out to around $50k, whereas Purdue is about $4k cheaper at $46K and RPI is only $44K. Are there any tips to make it more affordable? I hear in Ohio you can borrow your textbooks through OhioLink and on campus jobs are pretty feasible. \n4. What made you guys choose case? Was there anything specific that really motivated you to choose case instead of other schools?\n5. On the flip side, are there any red flags or problems with case that you would warn prospective students about?\n\nReally stressed about this whole process, so any advice, no matter how little, really helps. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Here's a couple of \"dirty little secrets\" about case, or, at least, things that the website won't tell you.\n\n1. There's basically no outward school spirit. On the contrary, people constantly make sarcastic jokes about CWRU or cleveland. Now, deep down, I think that most people really like it here(I certainly do, and I also make those jokes)... but if you're really into sports and school events and all that you might be a little disappointed. Personally I kind of like it... I enjoy the vibe of people constantly pretending to hate Case Western.\n2. There's a pretty big division between the party people and the nerds. If you're like me, where you're a nerd but want to dip your toes into the party scene every once in a while that doesn't really work so well... you just kind of have to wait for a friend of a friend to mention a party and show up only to realize that the reason why you heard about the party is that it's college-sponsored, so there's no alcohol. But personal anecdotes aside, you could make the mixed lifestyle work, you just have to put lots of effort into it. I personally like the division a little bit... it makes it a lot easier to find your people, and you don't really get judged if you're ever antisocial.\n\nI guess I've answered your last question first, so here's the others...\n\n1. the workload is a running joke at case, where people bite off more than they can chew and end up with a mental breakdown... it's been known to happen. I won't say it's easy, but my advice is to cast a wide net with extracurricular activites at first, and then really commit to the one you're most interested in and don't bother with the rest. But really, if you have your head screwed on straight and don't procrastinate, you'll be fine. Except for algorithms. That's a real bastard of a class(or so I'm told).\n2. This question really depends on your field. I've listened to lots of rants from BME students about how impossible it is to get an internship, while I on the other hand got 3 offers with basically no effort or prior experience(civil engineering=job security). I can't really speak to CS specifically.\n3. I'm not really knowledgable about the financial aid situation here at Case. ...it exists, I can tell you that much.\n4. for me personally it wasn't really a tough decision... my admission was during covid so I didn't have the SAT to help me get into schools. I don't know if I would've chosen case instead of other schools, but I'm happy that I ended up here. Reading back through the rest of this comment, I might come off as cynical or negative about the college, but I really do like it here... there's a lot that'll make you happy if you come here. I'm just trying to focus on the negatives because they don't often get discussed by the marketing(which was definitely my biggest frustration when I was filling out my applications).",

I kinda like that ambitious workload too it seems Case students are really driven to achieve their goals and change the world. I appreciate you covering the negatives, especially as an engineering student b/c I've heard your workload is miserable so you've def earned the right to complain. Thank you!",

They talked pretty highly about their co-ops, they mentioned a lot of jobs / internships could be done virtually through my major, and they spoke a lot on interdisciplinary research that can be done. I think the visit def made me enjoy case more but I'm still conflicted, what did you enojy most abt seeing it in person?",

            "comment": "1. The CS workload depends on what classes and how many classes you're taking. If you're taking all of the hard CS classes in the same semester, then you're not going to have a fun time. But it's definitely possible to take a balanced schedule, and then it's honestly pretty manageable. There will be some weeks where the workload feels like a lot, but overall I don't think it's too bad. In a given semester I'm involved in about 3-4 extracurriculars plus research, so there is definitely time outside of class. \n2. I would say your friend is right in that a lot of the internships / jobs are Ohio based, but it's certainly possible to land something not in Ohio. If you're curious about what companies CS students are going to, check out the CWRU first destination survey which shows starting salaries, companies, grad schools, etc. for the graduating classes. You can filter it by major: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cwru.office.of.institutional.research/viz/StudentOutcomes2022\\_2/PrimaryPlans](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cwru.office.of.institutional.research/viz/StudentOutcomes2022_2/PrimaryPlans). Things that helped me build my resume here were joining engineering competition-based clubs, getting involved in research, and landing a TA position. Case hires undergrad TAs, SIs, tutors, etc. even if you're an underclassmen which is nice.  \n3.  I don't want to speak too much on finances since this is very individual for each person. Go to a school that you can afford. I really like Case, but I wouldn't take on massive debt for it.\n4. I chose Case for the smaller size, great engineering program, and motivated student body. Everyone takes their education seriously, but it's not cut throat at all. It's extremely easy to get research here, and there are an abundance of CS-related research opportunities as well.\n5. Case recently started admitting larger class sizes, and it is getting harder to get into CS classes. My friends in the grade below me are struggling to get into classes that I was able to get into fairly easily last year (they have a larger class size than mine). I would say for CS class sign ups, it's hard to take the classes you want when you want to take them, but you'll get into them eventually.",

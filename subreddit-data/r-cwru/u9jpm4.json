    "postText": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nI have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/cwru) and I am really excited to share it with you.\n\nYou can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.\n\nLastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.\n\nEnjoy!!",

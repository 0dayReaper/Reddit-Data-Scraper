Because not only are surrounding areas blacker than most of the US, but they're also less wealthy and more likely to be in situations where they're driving with suspended/revoked licenses.\n\nThe stops are the most important data we need to see if any profiling's happening, but barring that, I'd like to see what percentage of Garfield Height's black drivers have a commuter path through University Circle and have suspended licenses and what percentage of white drivers have the same.  Additionally, police officers should be required to report why they pulled the person over if all they found was that the driver had a suspended license.\n\nUnfortunately, the race and racial disparity history of Cleveland (like most places) is not that great.",

Yes, the cops may be more likely to stop black drivers, but there a number of factors that play into whether a cop wants to stop someone.",

Interesting class and not too big of a workload, if I remember correctly I think we had 2 (short) final essays (like it was 1 assignment with 2 parts), a midterm exam, and weekly reading responses + peer reviews. Counts for global diversity, and I assume it would count for humanities as well. I took it as an elective for my environmental studies minor so if you're interested in that it counts for that as well.",

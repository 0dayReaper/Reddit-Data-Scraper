Measly particle wood kitchens, horrific bathrooms, and very dingy. Meanwhile, Juniper has new furniture, appliances, granite countertops, small kitchens with kitchen sinks on the residential floors (something CedarMag doesn\u2019t have), and all the Juniper buildings are connected so you can traverse multiple buildings without having to even go outside.",

If you haven\u2019t, I recommend looking at the floor plans for the buildings here: https://case.edu/housing/facilities/first-year-buildings The hall style floors have more of a connected design than the quads do in my opinion. You won\u2019t be on the first floor, btw. I\u2019d personally rank the communities (buildings, not people. good people can make any bad setting good) from best to worst as Juniper, Mistletoe, CedarMag, Clarke.",

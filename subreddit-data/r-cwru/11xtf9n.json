We have weekly discussion posts for the readings, videos, news responses, and drawings (like separate discussions for each). For the textbook readings we have corresponding quizzes. Also 2 presentations, 2 papers, 3 virtual labs, and a final project. Not super difficult material-wise though, but more work than previously expected.",

            "comment": "It is case by case. To my knowledge there are three common ways: REU, SOURCE, and hourly-rated RAship.\n\nReU is a NSF grant, around 6k+ a year per student, but obviously the prerequisite is your PI needs to have access of this grant and you need to be eligible for it. SOURCE is a Case thing, you basically submit a project application to get approved for funding ($3k-5k I believe). Last one go through the same channel as an undergraduate TA.\n\nI'd say the first and second ways are more likely to happen; since for the former your PI needs to spend the money anyway, yet for the latter it is school money. But it is relatively hard to convince a faculty to offer paid RAship for you, as there are a lot of undergraduate students willing to do research for free.",

I was under the impression that they are admin roles offered in library, IT, gym, etc; looks like I am misinformed.",

            "comment": "Depends on the lab/project and how much funding is available. PIs in higher-funded programs like BME will usually be more willing to pay undergrads. CS is another department that is fairly well-funded. You can always also look at CS-related research in BME. \n\n\n\nUndergrad pay rate scales from $11/hr (0-1 year of experience) to $13.90/hr (3-4 years of experience). This isn\u2019t a scale they have to abide by, but it is the min/max wage set by CWRU for undergraduate researchers. You will also be limited to a maximum of 20 hours a week, except for breaks when you can work 40/wk.",

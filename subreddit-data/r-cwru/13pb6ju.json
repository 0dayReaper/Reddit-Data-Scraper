    "postText": "Just wondering if there are any musicians/singers of the Class of 2027 on Reddit wanna room together. \n\nI am a Pre-Med freshman (Male, Asian, Jewish, he/they pronouns) who has also been working as a part-time music director/keyboardist in the DMV area. I play various genres of music, from classical music like Chopin to progressive metal like Dream Theater. \n\nMusical show tunes have been a large part of my music hobby too, I have been a rehearsal pianist for some small local theater companies and interned with the team of Wicked in the past few years. Singing with the cast during the rehearsals has always been a fun time. \n\nI especially enjoy jamming with folks in my dorm room throughout my high school years, and I would like to continue having fun with talented folks in my next four years at CWRU. So as I was going through the list of dorms, I thought having a suite of musicians jamming might be pretty fun, so that's why I'm here. \n\nI own three Nord keyboards (two Stage 3s and a Nord Grand) and a Roland AX-edge to deal with my gigs and events. I might choose to sell the Nord Grand depending on the room space I have upon arrival. \n\nBtw, I don't smoke and would like to keep tobacco out of the suite/room space. \n\nAdd my discord Lunatic#7284 if folks wanna talk about music or MCAT lolol",

If someone else who\u2019s not an alumnus has shared ownership with the folder then it will not be deleted (but you will lose access). If the folder is only shared with alumni, it will be deleted.\n\nShared Drives are different and owned by the University, they will not be deleted no matter what, but if only alumni have access it would go into purgatory.",

I want to do a project that will actually get somewhere. Does anyone have any advice on which professors have a history of publishing or opportunities around Case where I could learn a lot?",

It'd be pretty easy to find out who is aligned. \n\nThen maybe book meetings with those screened profs, \"ambush\" them in office hour, or reach out to their grad students.",

You will also be assigned a navigator who will help you through all of this. Last year the navigator was assigned after the May decision date (where students need to sign by). You are guaranteed housing and they will tell you when to sign up and walk you through the process so nothing to really worry about. CWRU handholds through the process so you won\u2019t miss anything. The road map will\nAppear in your portal.",

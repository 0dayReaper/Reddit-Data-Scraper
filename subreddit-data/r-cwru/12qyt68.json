I ended up deciding to do Master's elsewhere because I liked the program better, and Case isn't as good in this field (robotics). There aren't many robotics faculty or opportunities here, especially when compared to dedicated robotics masters programs",

ECSE 275 and 373 is good for getting an intro to how ROS works, but not really how to use it effectively/how to use it for projects and stuff. Robotics 1 is good for learning theory and stuff, but it's really math heavy (it's better if you know dynamics, lin alg, and matlab). Controls is helpful. Dynamics is helpful too but not necessary. ECSE 303 gives you an intro to raspberry pi stuff and can be helpful for the embedded side of robotics, but meh. If you wanna do more robotics stuff, you're gonna have to find it, since the robotics here isn't structured as well. Just take robotics related courses that interest you. If you actually wanna learn ROS and how to program robotics, join the robotics team (probably MATE for this) since they actually use it for their robot",

            "comment": "A Case CS student can land a MS somewhere else more prestige. Many of my peers went to Brown, CMU, Duke, Northwestern, UIUC, and Yale... which are generally perceived as more selective programs than Case's. However, some of the brightest peers I know decided to stay at Case for BS/MS for primarily three reasons:\n\n1. It is 0.5-1 year less than most standalone MS programs, thus more efficient in terms of time &amp; cost. So if your goal is to get the degree for career advancement, this is really hard to beat. \n2. If having research output is a major goal, the thesis MS option is very friendly as it drastically reduces your course load, plus you might already know your PI well. This offers a major competitive edge against doing research under a full course load with a professor you don't know if it is gonna vibe well.\n3. If you do the thesis MS, there's a well-known [financial hack](https://www.reddit.com/r/cwru/comments/tkf4st/comment/i1v0vlf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that can help keep the cost down even more.",

Also you can totally do a course-based MS at Case, if you don't know that maybe check the tracks again. People go elsewhere for a change of environment, better location, more course options, different education experience, etc.",

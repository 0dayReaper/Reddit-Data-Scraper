I know Greek life is big, but I\u2019m wondering how often stuff is going on. My other top choice is Northeastern, but Case is ranked higher for my intended major. Any advice would be great, thanks!!",

You could also visit for an admitted student event. \n\nYou can find what you need at case but it\u2019s not a party school. There is a social scene. There are a couple parties. The campus vibe is collaborative and nerdy in a good way. Cleveland and case may surprise you in a good way. Lots to do. It did us.\n\nDon\u2019t know the vibe at northeastern. Boston is great. \n\nBoth are good choices. \n\nGood luck.",

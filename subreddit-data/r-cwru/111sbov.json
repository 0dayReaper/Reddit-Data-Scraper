    "postText": "So Bio216 exam 1 scores were released and I did really poorly (did not pass) despite studying, memorizing, drawing diagrams, and attending class. I\u2019m really stressed because I was hoping this class could be a rebound from last semester but I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to go badly. I think I\u2019ve targeted some things I can do better to improve but I\u2019m quite sad and anxious. From anyone\u2019s experience, does it get better, how does the EC/HW impact your grade, and any study tips? Thanks",

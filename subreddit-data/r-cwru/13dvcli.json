I am trying to get my medical forms filled out, but I can't see what I need because I don't have a CWRU email yet.\n\nDoes it come out later this year? If anyone has the requirements, can you please leave it in the comments. Thanks &lt;3",

You can log in to the account by typing your CWRU network ID @case.edu\n\nYou'll be redirected to a page which will ask for your CWRU network ID and your passphrase.\n\nWhen you put those details in you'd log into your school email.\n\n(It's a Gmail account btw)",

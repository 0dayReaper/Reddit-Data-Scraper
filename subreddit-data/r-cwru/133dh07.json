She had a bit of a rough time with Neuroscience at Emory, and she found the classes/professor difficult. It\u2019s not like she struggles with science classes either, since she\u2019s made great grades in classes like orgo and biochem. \n\nPlus, CWRU and Ga Tech\u2019s lower attendance costs make these schools more appealing imo",

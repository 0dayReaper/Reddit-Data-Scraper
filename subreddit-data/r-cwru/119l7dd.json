    "postText": "Just admitted as a junior transfer into civil engineering from an LAC (no engineering, was physics major). I had a few questions about civil engineering at case.\n\n1. Is completing the degree in two years likely or will it require a semester or more?\n2. How are the career fairs and recruiting for civil majors? More specifically are there companies from the northeast (NYC metro and Boston) that come?\n\nWould really appreciate any insight.",

Since you were a physics major, I think you can transfer most of them, except for the engineering ones (of course, I could be completely wrong, it depends on what you've taken). \n\nThere's also SAGES (our writing seminar sequence), which you may or may not be able to transfer. This is probably going to be another 3 classes\n\nI'm guessing it'll take you between 2-3 years, depending on how rigorous you are and how many you credits/classes you can transfer over. If you have a list of courses that have been approved for transfer credit, it'll be much easier to figure out",

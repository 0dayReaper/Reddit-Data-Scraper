    "postText": "[Petition to make them change their minds](https://chng.it/9bCGXvBS)\n\nCase Western\u2019s administration is denying immunocompromised and otherwise disabled undergraduate students\u2019 requests for remote learning as an accommodation. Disability Resources is saying that if you are immunocompromised, then your condition is affected by the pandemic and therefore is no longer considered a disability, and that it is not a justifiable accommodation for any other disability. They also said that remote learning fundamentally alters the quality of the education, at the same time that they are fighting a lawsuit for refunds for Spring 2020 tuition by arguing that educational quality was not altered. When presented with a 2017 ruling by the Department of Education that remote learning was not an unreasonable accommodation, Disability Resources said \u201cit\u2019s not unjustifiable to ask. But we have to consider a lot of other things.\u201d Disability Resources is also ignoring input from professors about the feasibility of hybrid classes, telling professors they don\u2019t have the authority to grant remote attendance and then telling students that the office can\u2019t grant remote attendance because they need professors\u2019 permission. Professors are also reporting having their job security threatened by the administration when attempting to offer remote attendance. When the deans were contacted by department chairs, the deans refused to respond. When the deans were contacted by students, they said the decision isn\u2019t up to them it\u2019s up to disability resources. Who again said it wasn\u2019t up to them.\n\nThis is unethical and illegal, but any legal struggle is going to take months to resolve. And the provost is calling us all back to campus on Monday. Not only is this going to endanger the lives of at risk students, it\u2019s going to endanger the broader community because immunocompromised individuals can be more virulent carriers. Please take two minutes to sign this petition, and if you want, share it too.\n\nCase Western students have a right not to die. We have a right to receive an education. And we have a right not to be forced to choose between the two.",

They want the status-quo. They want a steady stream of incoming students and they want to retain faculty.\n\nPrivate institutions do what they want, and it's usually for money.

Since you seem too obtuse to understand how to use Google, I\u2019ll make it easier for you \u201cWhat does it actually mean to be immunocompromised? \nSimply put, it\u2019s when your immune system isn\u2019t working as well as it should to protect you from infection\u2014or that your immune system can\u2019t distinguish between normal and foreign cells. Seen through a COVID-19 lens, about 3% of the population in the United States is considered moderately-to-severely immunocompromised, making them more at risk for serious illness if they contract COVID-19, even after vaccination. This is because their immune systems don\u2019t mount a strong response to the vaccines. A March 2021 study showed only about 56% of immunocompromised people built sufficient levels of protection against COVID-19 after a second mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) dose.\u201d There ya go, did your homework for you\n\nEdit: That\u2019s straight from Yale\u2019s School of Medicine btw",

And we don't know if it will last well, cause 25+ weeks after the second shot the same VE is only 50-ish%.\n\nConsidered this VE will likely be lower for the immunocompromised population, and their symptom after getting infected is more severe.

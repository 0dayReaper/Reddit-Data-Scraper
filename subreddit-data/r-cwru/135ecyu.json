    "postText": "Hi I'm an incoming, low-income freshmen from India. I would really like to know which sim card companies offer the cheapest plans that give decent service as well to help me survive in college. What sim card companies do most students use if they're trying to save as much money as possible? Also can I use a US sim card in an Indian phone?",

The thing to worry about is LTE frequencies, although most modern phones have most frequencies these days. If you can tell me what phone you have, I can be more specific, but the long and short is *it will probably work fine*.",

Also, as I have seen others pointing out, CWRU is still known for being a midwestern engineering school, thus competing with schools like OSU, UMich, UIUC, and Purdue, all of which often have a better reputation/cheaper price (especially for in-state, who also happens to be the largest pool of applicants for CWRU)",

OSU was a lot cheaper if I were paying out of pocket, but the finaid they offered only offset a small portion of the cost. CWRU's finaid package was stellar, brought the annual net cost down to lower than OSU's.\n\nThere were other factors too, but that was a pretty big one.",

Case's undergraduate dorms are in a dilapidated state. The freshman dorms need air conditioning. When Western Reserve built its dorms, Cleveland was not as warm in the summertime. After climate changes and increases in energy use, Case needs to upgrade its dorms. When other local/regional univs. (JCU, for example) have the resources to add A/C, it is inexcusable Case does not. \n2. CWRU has low or little endowed chairs for its humanities. CWRU has a good reputation from its science and engineering programs, but the good rep (mostly) stems from the Case institute of technology and the WRU SOM. Case needs  more philanthropist to fund and structure its humanities. That is better said than done.\n3. Case undergrad's advising and career support services has decreased in quality over time. As CWRU increased its class size, the undergrad office should have increased in proportion. They did not. Many CWRU students in first year have complained regarding their Navigators. Case should hire more actual undergraduate advisors.\n4. Some of the science depts. have human resource and staffing problems. some professors have transitioned to other schools. In some depts., the amount of professors who will  adopt undergrads for research has decreased.",

Additionally, tuition is quite expensive, so if my children had a choice, I would prefer state schools over Case. In summary, Case isn't an Ivy League institution and doesn't hold much appeal in terms of name recognition. Many students return to their home countries, where people are generally unaware of Case. Education is very important, but name value also matters. Often, lesser-known small private schools provide better education because they hire younger professors who know how to deliver information to students more effectively.",

Business is poorly ranked and their CS program had a lot of people on campus speaking negatively about it being understaffed. It seems to have low name recognition compared to similar schools and was a notably dry campus.",

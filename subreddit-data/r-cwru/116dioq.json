However, I\u2019ve applied to both UH and the Clinic and ended turning down jobs for both. The issue is the don\u2019t cater to students very well, they\u2019re gonna want you to work holidays when we might be on break, and over the summer. So if that\u2019s something you\u2019re okay with then it\u2019s very easy to get a PCA job.",

You can balance your course load so you aren\u2019t taking all of the hard CS classes at the same time which helps a lot. All of my friends in CS have time for other clubs, research, etc. I don\u2019t know of any CS majors who have to study 24/7. Outside of classes, I have time for 2-3 music ensembles, research, and I used to TA on top of that too.",

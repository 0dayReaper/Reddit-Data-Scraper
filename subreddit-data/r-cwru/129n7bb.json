    "postText": "Hey all, I was recently admitted into cwru and university of minnesota twin cities, twin cities is overall not as highly ranked as cwru, however the business school rank is much higher. Cwru is also much more expensive. Is weatherhead really worth the extra money? Because after undergrad I want to go to NYC or Californi, and idk how good the networking is at weatherhead, or at carlson aswell. cwru is a stem school too and the business school is not really ranked that well compared to carlson. will companies care weather i graduate from cwru or carlson? im really confused on where to go rn and im just wondering if weatherhead has a good network, im reading online that there are only opportunities in cleveland, but does it expand past that? Thanks!",

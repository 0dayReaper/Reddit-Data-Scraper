            "comment": "Ok so I only went to one college (which I'm assuming you are using in the sense of the larger meaning of the word, not like the \"college of arts and sciences\" meaning of the word), but as a recent business major grad, hopefully I can help you out a little.\n\nBusiness major classes in general have a (fairly deserved) reputation around the cwru campus as being one of the easier majors.  If you are looking to only take the easiest possible courses, skate through, and find yourself in four years down the line with a business degree, you probably could.  This is true of business degrees at many other universities as well I'm sure.  But the better question I would ask you is why?  Why are you concerned with the ease with which you will pass, and not the content within that you will learn?  Taking easy classes (which I did my fair share of) is a great way for you to check out, not pay attention, and frankly, to come away from that class with credits and little else to show for it.  The best classes I took were without fail the ones that ended up challenging me, and I would challenge you to do the same, and think about why the classes being easy is a priority for you.\n\nI know this comes off as preachy and maybe a bit detached, but really consider why you want to go to cwru.  Because if the reason is easy classes, you may want to reconsider, there are plenty of other schools around the nation that have easy classes and a better social scene and are frankly just not in Cleveland, find someplace that makes you happy to be there, not someplace where you just want to get through the easiest classes they offer.  Anyways.  Sorry for the rambling answer.",

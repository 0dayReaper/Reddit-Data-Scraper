UNC looks to have a good program, and that would avert the constant inundation of /r/iamverysmart cringe from the university (not the students). If you want a challenge and actionable knowledge, go with UNC. I wish I could have given my former self this advice.",

I would say one word of advice is unless you really love research, pick something else for a major that has dual applicability. Cus a pure bio degree is pretty worthless without graduate school. And most of my peers who I went to my intro biology class with switched major.",

And the CS skills were pretty helpful when it came to getting into research labs and summer internships as usually, CS people don't go looking for biology-related projects and your usual biology majors don't have much or any CS skills to compete with you for those positions. However, I will not recommend this unless you are pretty good at math and a little bit passionate about CS.\n\nWhat I would recommend (Having gone through the application cycle and received numerous Acceptance later):\n\nIf you're deeply interested in Biological research and could potentially see yourself doing a PhD or MD/PhD in the future -&gt; go for a biology major.\n\nIf you don't see yourself doing research as a career in the future, but are confident that you are going into the med school path -&gt; go for a major that you are passionate about (it could be music, art, social science, etc) and just do the pre-med requirements (This could actually be a great X-factor down the line when you are being interviewed upon during medical school interview, but a word of advice don't do it to stand out do it because you are genuinely interested, as medical school interviewers can smell BS right away). And usually, when you're passionate about a subject, you do well in it so they can act as a great way for you to space out those hard pre-med courses if you're not confident in your ability to get As in multiple hard pre-med courses in a limited time frame.\n\nIf you're not confident that you are definitely going into pre-med, but you are confident in your ability to consistently get A's in your pre-med courses and you're not really passionate about anything else-&gt; go for a major with good job prospects (CS, Bio-engineering, Data Science, Math, stats, etc) so that in the off chance you don't feel like going med later down the road, you're not stuck with a useless degree.\n\nAll in all though, if you're thinking of applying to medical school GPA is very very important. So when selecting what major you want to do is very important to understand your own learning ability. You can always take gap years and as much time as you want to study for the MCAT, but to get an A in Biochemistry you only got 1 semester.",

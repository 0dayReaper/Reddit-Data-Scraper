    "postText": "I just recently got into Case! I didn\u2019t get my financial aid package since I had to do corrections but I am so worried I won\u2019t be able to afford it seeing how expensive it is. I got the University Scholarship with 36k annually and my EFC is 0 so my family is poor poor. I am also an Ohio resident so I get that aid as well but I will be staying on campus because it\u2019s a couple hours away from where I live. Do any of you guys have similar situation and what did Case cover? How much need based aid did they give you? What\u2019s the typical amount they offer for an EFC similar to that? I really want to go but I am a strong believer of not paying for undergrad education especially since I don\u2019t have any means to do so and hate the idea of taking out a large large loan. Thanks guys!\n\nedit: recently got my financial aid and they wanted me to pay around 10k per year which is a little too expensive for me. I decided even though it was my top school to commit to OSU instead because they are covering it fully for me plus offering me more money so I can do undergraduate debt free! Thank you all for helping!",

You can also set up payment plans so the 4k is spread over a few months. Or take out loans and you usually get more money in loans than u need",

Or take the loans \u2026 many of my friends took the loans, got jobs on campus and were able to pay them off and didn\u2019t need the loans again after the first year. It\u2019s manageable, the school encourages you to get food stamps, I would take them. I wish someone was this transparent when I came because I would\u2019ve been a lot less stressed about it, but lmk if you have more questions. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking into any other private university like CWRU, expect the bill to be the same\u2026",

From what I gathered on the website, it\u2019s in CedarMag (suite style housing) and they opened at least a floor for GIH last year (which means at least 36 people). They don\u2019t have many specifics on exactly how many people though. I believe that before they updated the website for this year, it even specified that all of it was in [Cutler House](https://case.edu/housing/facilities/first-year-buildings/cutler-house) if you\u2019d like to look at an example of the dorms. \n\nYou can read more about it here: https://case.edu/housing/first-year-student-gender-inclusive-housing",

In the regular housing, a suite is all girls or all boys bc you share a bathroom. \n\nI\u2019m not a part of the lgbt community nor did I apply for inclusive housing, so this what I gathered from my first year",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m currently deciding between TCNJ and CWRU. I do like both schools, but TCNJ is about 20k cheaper(31k vs 56k), closer to home, and I also got into the Bonner Scholars Program, which is pretty selective and offers some good opportunities. Additionally, TCNJ does have a smaller undergraduate population, so I can easily get a research opportunity and get good letters of recommendation.  The only downside to TCNJ is the very few hospitals near it. But, since I am going pre-med, I know how good CWRU is for my interests. I am mainly worried about the harder classes/GPA and the cost. It would be great if I could have another opinion on what college I should choose from somebody attending CWRU. Thanks in advance!",

No one can tell you what the right decision for you is. You can be a great pre-med student anywhere just work hard and hustle. Good luck.",

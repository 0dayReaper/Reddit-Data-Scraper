I know many people who are just BME/premed majors and a lot of them have chosen to do 5 years because it\u2019s a hard major to combine with anything else. Definitely talk to your advisor.",

I cannot even begin to imagine what double majoring with CS would look like.\n\nI think your best bet would be to major in bme and minor in cs. That\u2019s still difficult, but much more manageable. Or Vice versa (tho most bme courses have pre reqs you\u2019d have to take anyway).",

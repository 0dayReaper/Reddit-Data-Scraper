    "postText": "Have any of yall taken MATH 307 with Mark Meckes? I am with another professor this year and the experience was HORRIBLE so I did P/nP. I just want to know what's grade break-up and what's his exams like? Is it abstract with a whole ton of analysis and the question doesn't even contain a single number, or is it rather practical? I can do 201 to meet the requirements too, but there is a conflict in schedule. I'd rather not.",

If you do well on the homework you will do well on the exams. If you dm me I can see if I can find my old exams if you want, but mind you they are from like Fall 2018 or something.",

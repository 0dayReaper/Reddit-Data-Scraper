    "postText": "Hey everyone! I hope this is ok to post but I was wondering if there were any law students on here who could speak more to the health law program at Case. I got accepted as a Gerber Law-Medicine fellow and am considering visiting if i have time to take off work but I\u2019m trying to get some outside opinions. Also, if anyone can speak to whether Case has some alumni connections in Chicago that would be helpful too.\n\nThank you sm and I hope everyone\u2019s semesters are going well &lt;33",

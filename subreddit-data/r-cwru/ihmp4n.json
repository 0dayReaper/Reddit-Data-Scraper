    "postText": "The 2020 election will be one of the most important in history. Make sure you are registered to vote, and that your vote is counted! In Ohio, you must register by October 5th. You can register at https://olvr.ohiosos.gov/\n\nEarly in-person voting for Ohio starts on October 6th and ends on November 2nd. In most counties, you can vote early at your [county Board of Elections](https://www.ohiosos.gov/elections/elections-officials/county-boards-of-elections-directory/).  In Cleveland, that's 2925 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH.\n\nIf you want to vote in your home county, or just skip the lines at the polls, you can request a mail-in ballot via this link: https://www.ohiosos.gov/publications/#abr. Do so as soon as possible to make sure your ballot arrives and is sent back on time.  Send it to the county you're registered in! Your ballot must be postmarked by November 2nd, and received by November 13th. Send it back as soon as possible, or drop it off in person at your [county Board of Elections](https://www.ohiosos.gov/elections/elections-officials/county-boards-of-elections-directory/).  Again, in Cleveland that's that's 2925 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH, and the drop box is in the rear parking lot.  Other counties may also have a ballot drop box at another location; check their website for more information.  If you submit your mail ballot in person, you must do so by November 3rd.  \n\nIf you mail your ballot, you can track it [here](https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/voters/toolkit/ballot-tracking/).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!",

The position pays up to $275 depending on which exact responsibilities.",

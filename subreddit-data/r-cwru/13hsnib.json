    "postText": "I\u2019m hoping to take a few classes over the summer, with the first class starting tomorrow, May 15th. I was wondering if I could drop the course by at least the first day of classes if I realize the format of the course does not work with my schedule. There is no information on the Case website about the add/drop period during the summer semester and was wondering if anyone had any information on this.",

Bedridden for weeks, excruciating headaches, waves of nausea, the works. Still, an acquaintance tested positive and continued to party because he felt fine. Some people are idiots, but that doesn't mean you have to be. But, just because you don't know anyone that has had it, doesn't mean the risk isn't real.\n\nI have a lot of friends working at the different hospitals around campus and I can't even imagine the nightmare that they are going through each and every day. I'm worried about them especially. Cleveland is still a hot spot and everyone that willingly came back to campus has to do something to help those around them and themselves. I don't want my friends to die.",

The soda tasted flat and very watered down, so I called the company and told them their soda was crap and I wanted a refund... turns out I had lost my taste and smell, and I didn't get it back for about a week. For a couple months afterwards, I dealt with kidney problems. The people who gave it to me got tested for antibodies recently and have enough antibodies to donate plasma, so at least one good thing came out of it. I consider myself extremely lucky since I'm immune-compromised, and you really never know how your body is going to react to the virus.",

            "comment": "My grandparents who live in Miami Florida both got Covid recently from my cousin. He was careless and didnt wear a mask and hung out with a lot of people. My Abuelo has a pacemaker and dementia. So far he is okay, my Abuela has asthma and is okay right now as well. However, my aunt who had to take care of them got it and is far worse. Biggest takeaway from my family's experience with it so far. Covid effects every1 completely differently. Even if you are low risk you could get extremely bad and vise versa. My aunt is currently in the hospital because of it. Don't think that you or any1 close to you would be okay if they got. BE SAFE.",

Atleast the freshmen I have talked to have been respectful and fixed what they were doing and they've been getting better over the last few days !",

You get a ton of opportunities and generally, the atmosphere here is really collaborative and many people are more than happy to share their journey with you. Let me know if you have any specific questions",

I\u2019m just wondering if the opportunities presented at CWRU will be easier to seize just because it\u2019s a smaller student body that isn\u2019t as \u201ccompetitive\u201d (I\u2019m not the most outspoken person so I think it\u2019d be harder for me to do well in an environment with a mass of people who are very high-achieving)",

            "comment": "For CWRU is it PPSP that you are doing? If so, they conditionally guarantee you a spot in whatever health professions school you applied to. With the dental school, people think the main benefit is you can apply out, meaning when you get to the point where you are actually applying to dental school, you are free to also apply to other dental schools and if you are capable of getting into a better school, you can go there instead. Almost everybody in the dental PPSP applies out, most are successful in getting into their significantly cheaper state school or a big name school, and most only considered the CWRU dental school as a backup. It makes logical sense in that you were stellar enough to get PPSP, if you kept it up in college you would have no issue being an excellent candidate for top dental schools. It can be nice to have the safety net there, but it also means if you don't succeed in getting into other schools you're kinda stuck.",

    "postText": "I know 64% is higher than the nation average but... I know a lot of other schools that aren't as great for pre-med compared to case western yet have higher acceptances for pre meds to med school.\n\nCan anyone kind of explain this?? Is it because case western doesn't weed out students? Or is it because there are simply more pre med students? \n\nI know case western has a bunch of hospitals near by and case is basically known to be a pre med school... so, yeah, I don't know.",

            "comment": "That\u2019s phenomenal. Given overall acceptance rate is 40%, I would not overthink that case\u2019s is 24 percentage points higher even as you can name a few schools with higher rates. \n\nTo get into med school you need good grades and a good mcat score most importantly. But you need a compelling application and to pick schools carefully and apply to a lot of them. \n\nIf you are worried, you could pick a school with a higher rate, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re increasing your odds.",

Also, Notre Dame (for example) dissuades anyone who they don\u2019t think will be strong selection for med school to to grades or being international or whatever from declaring premed. There is a discussion in the ND thread right now.",

Other schools at times have higher bar for the letter, they explained. Students with more competitive grades and scores than the minimum have much higher acceptance than the 68% they quoted. \n\nMuch discussion about clinic hours and internships and such that can make motivated case students stand out",

At least CWRU isn't putting fake numbers out there. If the national acceptance rate is something like 39% and 64% of CWRU students get in then that means they are doing a great job imo",

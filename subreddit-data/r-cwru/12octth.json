    "postText": "Hi guys! I am a rising junior in CS and I really need STAT 312 next sem to take the classes in my track afterward. The competition is too competitive and I can only plead for help from you guys. I would be grateful forever if you could share the slot with me if you feel like you don't need the class right now. I would accept from any Prof., but Prof. Song would be the best... Thank you guys so much!",

I've basically given up at this point, but will still let you know if anything happens. \n\n\nI hope you're able to get a seat in the class somehow.",

I'm still waiting on other schools for RD, but I'm seriously considering case western as they gave me a pretty sizable scholarship.\n\nI also got accepted into the baker-nord scholars program, but I don't really know what it's about. I read the descriptions and everything and from what I gathered, it is not THAT useful...? How useful was it for you guys? Was it very time consuming? Do you get some sort of advantage, or is it just for a group of people to hang out?\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear more about it! &lt;3",

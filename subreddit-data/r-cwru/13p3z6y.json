    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman undergrad at CWRU and received a 30k per year merit scholarship when I was accepted EA. \n\nI currently have 5 solid A\u2019s, and 2 C\u2019s, one being a C+. Both C\u2019s are in AP courses. I don\u2019t see my grades changing after my finals(getting my C+ to a B- will be extremely hard). My gpa is around a 3.3 uw and 3.8 w right now. For reference, I was admitted with a ~3.6 uw.\nDo you think I\u2019ll be rescinded or have my scholarship revoked?",

If you are planning on doing engineering and the C\u2019s are in calculus, they might be worried. Your best bet would be to think about the C\u2019s and possibly consider emailing your admission counselor to explain what happened.",

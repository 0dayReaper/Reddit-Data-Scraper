    "postText": "I am considering staying in Euclid 3 next year but don't know if I want to stay the full 12 months of the lease. Does anyone have any experience/knowledge of how easy it is to sublease for the summer? Like will it be worth it (enough interest to be able to sublease) or do people staying here for the summer tend to go for on campus housing?\n\nI'd appreciate any responses as we need to decide by 9am tmrw",

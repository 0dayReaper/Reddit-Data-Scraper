            "comment": "Imo, the best way to describe the social life is that you have to go looking for it. It definitely exists and there are a few parties every weekend, plus a couple bars near by that upperclassmen will frequent.   \n\nThere isn\u2019t a lot of school spirit, so football games have mediocre attendance. \n\nIn my experience most of my social life has been based around clubs and people I meet in classes. There is a small hook up scene as well, but most people just date.",

The general consensus is it is not a party school but you'd find friends very easily as long as you don't hole yourself up.",

Greek Life seems to be fairly popular, but doesn\u2019t have a huge impact on the college like it does at some other schools. She also said that the football games are actually pretty well attended, despite being D3.",

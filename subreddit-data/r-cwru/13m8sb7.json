As a CS major the only Windows-only program I had to use was Origin and Verilog software, which you can use Case\u2019s remote desktop or Parallels to run. For most classes you\u2019ll be using VS Code or IntelliJ anyway.\n\nIt helps if you\u2019re already in the Apple ecosystem too. If else, I heard XPS 15 is alright.",

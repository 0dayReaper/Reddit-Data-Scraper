    "postText": "Hi,\n\n  Greetings. I checked the CWRU medical school class profile. On an average only around CWRU premeds get into CWRU medical school. But roughly 20 students get accepted through the PPSP program. That means, only 5 CWRU premeds get in through the regular program? Do I miss something? I contacted the CWRU premed staff, they are not forthcoming with the statistics. Can someone from CWRU medical school shed some light on this please? Thank you",

You can look at CWRU medical school's incoming class profile and see that only 2.5% of people who applied matriculated. If they did accept 10 case students outside of PPSP like you said, then I think that is pretty good. And as the other commenters said above, going somewhere for undergrad doesn't have anything do with your chances of getting into that institution's medical school.",

Many CWRU grads who enter med school don't fill the post-graduation survey. Thus, the school reports a low number of med school entrants.",

            "comment": "I liked the physics program. I went with a BA in pure physics. You\u2019ll spend ~2 years in larger classes before taking more specialized courses. Some Junior and Senior courses only happen once every 2 years (like Advanced laser physics) so you might need to plan ahead as a rising Junior. If you don\u2019t have very particular interests planning too far head isn\u2019t necessary though. \n\nThe labs are particularly great, especially Junior lab that puts pretty open-ended problems in front of you. Yes, almost everyone winds up doing them almost the same way, but you still have to do the fun part of figuring out *why* everyone does them that way. Or maybe you\u2019ll come up with a solution the professor\u2019s never seen before which makes doing the error analysis a lot more fun.\n\nJunior and senior year will stress your overall knowledge. Often requiring you to flex programming skills you learned in prior classes in order to solve weekly homework problems. Do your homework is my #1 recommendation for the whole Physics program. Some classes make homework optional, but that\u2019s just so you can royally screw it up without impacting your grade. Doing the homework and discussing what you got wrong with a TA or the professor is necessary for learning the material. \n\nIt\u2019s easy enough to find research opportunities which I obviously recommend. Though I wouldn\u2019t pass up an internship either. I wound up going into industry rather an academia after my internship.",

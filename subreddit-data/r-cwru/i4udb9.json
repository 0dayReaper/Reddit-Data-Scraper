I forgave this level of oversight at the very beginning with their ridiculously fast move out requirements but we are almost a half a year in at this point and it's like these decisions and being made by a legion of brain dead troglodytes.",

To give you a sense of the madness from the faculty perspective, literally 16 hours before this announcement, the administrative was still pressuring faculty to teach in person.  Then the 100 percent turnaround.  Anyone on the faculty with any common sense is planning to teach remotely.  They know that there is no predicting the behavior of the administration.  One day there will be an out-of-the-blue announcement like this one that says everything is fully remote and not to come to campus.  I am almost sure of it.  What happens to the students who signed a one-year lease to an apartment in university circle?  That person is now living in Cleveland and taking classes remotely at much higher expense.  If I were in a student's shoes, no way would I risk coming back.",

So many students are rapidly signing leases right now, as a senior I\u2019m hoping to remain in village housing and not have to pay for a lease. But if that goes under (which based on what everyone seems to be speculating it will) I\u2019ll probably end up signing a lease and commuting around to have some sort of college experience. But I totally agree, if I was a non senior or non freshman I would probably just stay home and save on the rent.",

Now, it's been an average of 1300 cases a day for the last week, following a prolonged dip in June. \n\nAs for long term conditions, it's rare, but possible. A 27 y/o baseball player got an inflamed heart from COVID, and that will probably affect his health in different ways down the line. Yes, the inflamed heart can be treated.

Regardless of what statistics I find suggesting otherwise, I will never change your mind.

If you\u2019d lost someone close to you from coronavirus, perhaps you\u2019d think differently. While I\u2019m upset CWRU waited so long, I\u2019m glad that they are finally taking action. Most students don\u2019t need to be on campus this semester point blank.  Those with extenuating circumstances should definitely be allowed to return, but pretending things are safe as can be in Cuyahoga County is moronic. Have a good day.",

The conversation among faculty both here and nationwide has been strongly in favor of all remote for the fall to keep people safer and to ensure that the semester is not disrupted like the spring. Our input has only been sought by executives here on pedagogical matters related to different modes of teaching, not on the overall plan. I think there has also been a lack of appreciation that any change to the plan creates complex problems for students, especially when done at the last minute.\n\nThat said, there is another side to the story, which is that even though CWRU has a decent endowment our ongoing operations are heavily dependent on tuition and housing revenue being stable. We can only offset declines by drawing down on the endowment or borrowing to a limited degree. Having housing half-occupied will create big financial issues. Faculty and professional staff have already taken a 10% pay cut and that\u2019s not going to be enough. More cuts are going to be needed. That\u2019s bad because universities are harder to rebuild than, say, private companies. Given that this is a temporary crisis there is are strong arguments that higher ed should get a federal bailout to maintain operations until the pandemic is over. But as we\u2019ve seen Congress can\u2019t even pass extended unemployment so people don\u2019t go hungry. The needle the administration is trying to thread is extremely difficult.",

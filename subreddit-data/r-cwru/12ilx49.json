    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a second year pre med major and was thinking about declaring a math minor. I just wanted to reassure myself that I need 17 credits for the minor, with 2 being at the 300 level and only 2 classes that can be shared with your major. Also, I just wanted to see if any of you had any recommendations for 300 level math courses that are interesting and aren\u2019t super difficult. I was thinking discrete and number theory, or even that mathematics or the brain once I take entering 131, but open to all options. Thanks",

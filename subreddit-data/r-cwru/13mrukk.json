Though I will caution against choosing a college based on \u2018t20 grad school placement\u2019 since a) grad school is still a long way down the road, and you might have a change of plan. Secondly, b) grad school app, from what I know, emphasizes a lot more about research experience and grades rather than school prestige. If you have any specific question, let me know and I can DM you.",

There are PLENTY of research spots available for undergrads. Everyone I know at Case who wants to do research is currently working in a lab. Almost all of my friends are involved in some sort of research on campus. In the lab I work in, the grad students have been great mentors for me while still giving me a lot of independence, so I feel like having grad students is actually a plus.",

Obviously there are good teachers, but the number of bad teachers is not healthy, which is rather frightening for a student like me who always seeks special care. I am afraid with what extent of patience and dedication will the professors teach me at Case Western. This huge care/attention from profs are available at liberal arts colleges and that's why I am sometimes attracted to them, even for CS. But if I get a hint that I would get similar care at Case Western, I am having far less hard time finally attending CWRU CS",

And who can be a better \"someone\" than a grad student who works on the exact topic every day of the week? Also, who will pay for the hardware if no grad student uses such infra to make such investment meaningful?\n\nThis is especially true in CS research. The rapidly growing nature makes most CS professors not work with code directly. Yet a vast majority of research code is hacky with limited docs. It will be hard without someone who already knows things to guide you.\n\nYes, you might have more exposure with your professor in a LAC setting, which is excellent for many things. **But generally, you don't need to meet with your professor for research that frequently.** If you don't have concrete updates, or if the roadblock you are facing is not something the professor will help with (e.g., code troubleshoots), it'd be time-wasting for both parties.",

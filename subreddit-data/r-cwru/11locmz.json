But I don't like philosophy anymore and I want to switch to nursing. Would it be possible for me to switch majors to nursing and still keep my scholarship...",

Depending on major you declared, your scholarship could be from the school tied to philosophy. Not sure how easily it can be switched to a different school. (My kid has one from Bolton school.

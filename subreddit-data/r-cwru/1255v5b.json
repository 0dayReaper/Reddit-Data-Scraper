    "postText": "After my acceptance to Case Western Reserve University I have heard things online and and in person about the environment (not solely because of the location in Cleveland, but the people there in general). If someone has attended CWRU and wants to input some of there background or experience that would be amazing. I genuinely want feedback about the school because it is one of the best ones I have currently gotten into, my dad is also strongly encouraging my enrollment here. \nIs the school fun? Could you develop a nice social life while also studying? (ik it\u2019s great academically). The weather? \nAnyone feel free to share your current situation as to how you feel about cwru I would love to see how you feel.\n\nEdit: Thought of more questions: How are the dorms at cwru in terms of safety, temp, room/dorm mates?\nAre there a lot of clubs to join for different interests and groups of people on campus?",

I still keep in contact with several of my freshman floor-mates (who are the main friends I had through the 4 years at case).\n\nCase isn\u2019t known as a party school but there\u2019s still plenty of parties to be found. Whether at frat houses or upper classman dorms or off campus houses \u2026 just plenty of opportunities.\n\nAnd if drinking isn\u2019t your preferred way of having fun, I know there were plenty of other activists like board game groups and other things.\n\nAnyways. I really enjoyed my time at Case and am so glad I went there. I think fun is what you make of it. Sometimes it took some effort to find parties. But they\u2019re out there.\n\nFor your freshman dorm I definitely recommend one that has common areas on each floor. Mine was Pierce. Storrs is another (mirrors pierce). Then in the first few weeks of the year HANG OUT IN THE COMMON AREA. Others will join. Easiest way to make friends. That\u2019s at least what I did and most of the friends I keep in contact with 10 years later are people that hung out in that common area in the first few weeks. Also it was nice the floors in my building were co-ed (both guys and girls).",

That being from guards games downtown, dinner in little Italy, Mitchell\u2019s runs, and all the little things in between! I would say it\u2019s extremely easy to have a social life with a friend group but if you\u2019re asking about a social life with party\u2019s it definitely takes time. That being said, if you\u2019re looking to party more than the average cwru student it takes connections and possibly being in Greek life. The thought of the weather scared me at first but it\u2019s truthfully only been bad for like a week at a time and then it\u2019s nice again. Case is a niche experience but I think anyone can have fun and strive academically and socially here! \n\nI have to add the link that is tagged is pretty true. Overall, academically it\u2019s hard, socially it can be a struggle but go Greek if you can!",

There are a lot of BME premeds here don\u2019t get me wrong, but BME is arguably one of the toughest majors here. GPA is very important for dental/med school applications and it is harder to get a high GPA in BME vs. some other majors. I know a BME premed who managed to get a 4.0 going into his senior year and he seemed to think it wasn\u2019t worth the extra difficulty and stress. With that said, the first year isn\u2019t too bad so you can definitely try it out to see how it goes. Sophomore year physiology is when it seems like it starts getting harder.",

People are super friendly, and there are always things to do. The college organizes a lot of things (spring comedian, concerts, etc) but you can also find more casual things to do with friends.\n\n\"The weather?\"\nNot great but comparable to other schools in cold places. Invest in good winter gear and you'll be fine.\n\n\"How are the dorms at cwru in terms of safety, temp, room/dorm mates?\"\nFreshman dorms are worse than upperclassmen housing, but still not that bad. And freshman are in a collective residential village with a dining hall and residential community events, which kind of makes up for the dorms themselves. Safety is not an issue; you have to swipe a keycard to get in. No AC, but honestly you don't need it after the first few weeks. Roommates are always hit or miss, but most people I know at least get along.\n\n\"Are there a lot of clubs to join for different interests and groups of people on campus?\"\nYes! So many clubs for literally any interest! And if there isn't a club, you can start one and get funding from the student government. Like I said, people are really friendly and are always open to new people joining!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

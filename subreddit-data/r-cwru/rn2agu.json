    "postText": "Anyone else annoyed at the new covid plans for spring? It\u2019s clear that even tho everything is gonna be virtual (only the first two weeks supposedly, which I mean we\u2019ve all heard that before) we are still gonna move in during the normal time frame.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point?? To me it just sounds like they don\u2019t want to lose out on any room and board money. And you already know that they are gonna have so many regulations about shared spaces, It\u2019s practically gonna be everyone just holed up in their rooms.",

            "comment": "Faculty member who just made a throwaway to comment on this -- not  to defend the administration but to provide some context.\n\nWhat the administration is telling us is that they expect a lot of positive tests right after people come back (due to the holidays, travel, mixing, omicron etc.) They think a lot of students are going to need to be in isolation right at the beginning of the semester, and excluding students from the first two weeks is going to really set them up for failure. So they're claiming this is about equity and student success.\n\nFrom a faculty perspective, this is all frustrating because it's a decent amount of work to turn an in person class into a remote class. I'm going to spend a good chunk of the break figuring out how to rejig things into a remote format, making videos etc. etc., when I want to be getting on with research and spending time with my family.",

The university has to choose the least bad option between these:  \n\n\nA) No changes from last semester, despite a huge nationwide spike in cases and the likelihood we would have to shut down like Cornell just did \\[1\\].  \n\n\nB) Move everything to all remote for the whole semester, even though it will disappoint students and jeopardize international student visas.  \n\n\nC) Try to find a middle ground.  \n\n\nThey chose C, which is probably what most of us would want them to do.  \n\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/12/14/1064197606/cornell-university-omicron-campus-shut-down-covid](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/12/14/1064197606/cornell-university-omicron-campus-shut-down-covid)",

With this plan, people will all be back at the same time, get tested, and isolate while the spike (hopefully) passes. If classes were in person like normal, it would be extremely difficult for both students and faculty to try to keep up with absences and illness. Not to mention that there probably would be a significant risk of spread if in-person classes were to begin right after everyone travels back to campus.\n\nWe know Case loves their money, but what college doesn\u2019t? Not everything is about money. I think this plan is a smart compromise to try to keep everyone safe when returning to campus, and to minimize disruptions from the inevitable spike in cases at the beginning of the semester.",

    "postText": "Hey CWRU students! I am an incoming freshman for the class of 27 and had a question about which AP exams are even worth studying for. I plan to major in mechanical engineering and have signed up for Calc AB, Bio, Micro, and Macro. I know AB would be worthwhile but I wasn\u2019t sure about the rest. Thanks for your help!",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t see the harm in taking all of the exams if you\u2019re up for it. Even if it doesn\u2019t go towards mechE specifically, it could help with the engineering breadth requirement. All engineering majors have to take 4 classes outside of the school of engineering. I was able to get all 4 classes out of the way with AP credit.\n\nEdit: you can read more about the engineering general education requirements here: [engineering gen eds](https://case.edu/ugstudies/students/transfer-students/transfer-and-dual-degree-student-registration-guide/case-school-engineering-general-education-requirements)",

Things will change slightly from that.\n\nMicro/Macro would likely count towards some breadth requirements.  Calc could get you out of some math credits. Not sure what bio would get you as a mech E student (i.e., it's a STEM class so...).",

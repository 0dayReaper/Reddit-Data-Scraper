    "postText": "https://observer.case.edu/what-your-tour-guides-dont-tell-you-about-case-western/\n\nJust read this post while internet surfing, got a bit scared. I've committed to case for fall 2023, and i was wondering if the workload is that bad, that you can't have a social life when trying to maintain good grades and working on campus? I'm not a party person btw, if it helps. \n\nHow bad is the workload of assignments and work? Are the professors helpful and proficient in their subject? I'm planning to do systems biology. \n\nThanks for any help!",

It is generally not that big of a deal, there are plenty of alternatives, and I can't imagine any of it being a deal breaker unless you want to compromise nothing \u2014 but even if that is the case, how many colleges out here have great food, 24/7 library, and no-fuss gen ed? Kinda hard to find even on a national scale. Plus, there are 1001 things that can be more impactful to your college life than any of those.\n\nI'd add that there are many great SAGES options if you ask around. It is a unique opportunity for your peers and professors to discuss and reflect on things outside major materials and meet people across departments. I'd say the department seminar is more of a time waste than anything (at least in CS, still with great instructors tho).\n\nThe social factor of Case is \"low\" as not many students actively seek public parties and events. I, for one, never went to any public party, but I had plenty of fun by inviting friends to cook in, drive out, play board games/club sports, build stuff, or just grab a coffee and chill. You can search \"social\" in this subreddit to get a feel.",

You're gonna be fine. The social scene is not great as others have said but take some time to get off campus and explore the city, Cleveland rules.",

I\u2019m a transfer student and personally I like Case\u2019s campus and course selections better, but many people I\u2019ve talked to have said RPI is way more well known in the Northeast. Where do most Case graduates for engineering work after graduation?",

            "comment": "Civil engineering graduate (2008) from the northeast (Upstate NY) here. Yes, what you have heard is correct. CWRU civil is a very small program, and there just isn't a lot of us out in the professional world compared to most other universities. So, the name recognition is not there outside of the local area. However, that would be the same for any small, private civil engineering program (Clarkson, RPI, WPI, Lehigh, Bucknell, CMU, ESF, etc.).\n\nMost graduates tend to stick around the \"local\" area (Ohio, Michigan, Western PA, etc.) for their first job. I wanted to move to the NE after college, so I went to a career fair at Cornell my senior year since most of CWRU's was mostly regional/local companies. No problem for me getting interviews/job and that was during a recession! After you get some experience, your school doesn't really matter and lots of my classmates now live all over.\n\nSince the industry is pretty 'hot', every company is in need of entry-level engineers. You shouldn't have any issues getting a job no matter where you go (as long as you have some experience and can speak intelligently). \n\nI loved my experience as a civil student at CWRU (I had my own key to Bingham lol) and the education has set me up well in my career. Let me know if you have any other questions about CWRU or civil engineering!",

There seems to be way more structural offerings at case than rpi, and case also has a construction management track which rpi does not. So are you saying other colleges let outside student attend career fairs, like if I were to work in nyc I could attend Columbia\u2019s?\n \n  Also is it true that many companies require you to get a masters in structural?",

                            "comment": "Yes. CWRU is definitely structural/geotechnical heavy. I don't know much about the construction management track but would recommend doing more technical electives to get the most out of your education (I mean scheduling, cost estimating, budgeting isn't exactly that difficult and learnt through experience, not a classroom). Most of my classmates did structural and started out in structural/transportation type firms but now do construction/project management. \n\nI don't know if it is allowed, but I just walked into the Cornell one - white man confidence! The employers loved it because it showed initiative! Just my experience so YMMV.\n\nI'm water resource engineer (dam safety specifically), so you might want to ask in the civil sub to get better answers for structural. If you want to do highly technical work, a masters would probably be beneficial and make you competitive to the top firms. Definitely not a requirement for most places though. Most of my classmates just got their bachelors - I got my masters while working full time.",

The CMs would take a theater class as an elective when I was there, lol! As a water resource engineer, I took a few electives outside the department for my technical electives. Definitely structural is the focus!",

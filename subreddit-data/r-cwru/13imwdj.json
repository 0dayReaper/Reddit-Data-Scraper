    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman for class of 2027. On the website for AP credits, it says \" If, after admission to CWRU, you complete a course for which you received credit/exemption on the basis of AP, IB or A-Level examinations, the credit/exemption for that course will be forfeited and will not count toward graduation requirements.\"\n\nSince I got into Case Western before I took my senior AP exams, does that mean that the exams I took senior year don't count for AP credit? I listed on my application last fall that I'd be taking these exams my senior year.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, tips on finding a freshman roommate? I have filled out the housing application but am still struggling to find a roommate through the website.",

    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019m trying to narrow my BS/MD program options and I\u2019m down to Pitt and Case. Does anyone have any useful advice or input on this choice? I\u2019m yet to visit either campus, but plan to do so by the end of April. Any comments on social life, the city, opportunities, and overall culture would be so helpful. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I graduated from Case. I loved my time there and is a \"effort in =effort out\" school. A lot of people there dog on the school because they are ivy league waitlists. Those people are miserable because they want to be miserable. If you work on making friends and building a social life, you'll have one. I was able to do many interesting activities and I have lifelong friends after my time at Case. The undergrad is smaller than Pitt, but that translated for me into ample research opportunities and excellent relationships with professors. There is also the #2 ranked hospital system within walking distance, as well as a top VA, community hospital (MetroHealth, which is similar to Grady in Atlanta). The med school matches with the best of them and the cost of living is extremely low compared to many cities across the US. Cleveland Clinic gives you access to funding and experiences that are not possible at many institutions, and the food scene in cleveland is vastly underrated. I would say tour both schools and pick what you like. If you're more into research or the minutiae of medicine, Case is the answer. I would put Pitt ahead though for Primary care or focus on service. \n\nSource: CWRU alum attending a T20 med school who didn't even get into Case Med.",

Some people do not thrive in a large undergraduate body, and your competition to stand out and get those opportunities is directly correlated with the size of the student body. I'm not saying at all that Pitt is a bad school, but not everyone succeeds everywhere. UPMC is a wonderful health system, but it is not Cleveland Clinic. I'm not at all dogging on Pitt Med, I applied and would have loved to go, it's just going to be what they're interested in /shrug",

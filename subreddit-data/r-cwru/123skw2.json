What companies offer internships?\n2. What are some on/off-campus jobs available?\n3. What's there to do over the weekend, like what activities are there?\n\nThanks in advance for answering them!",

            "comment": "Hi, I\u2019m more of a comp-sci/physics first year, so if there are others who are CE specific that would be great. For me, I think CWRU is pretty good, the support system is great with helpful professors and great TA and SI. In terms of what companies offer internship, my understanding is that it still very largely depend on yourself. We aren\u2019t located in the Bay Area or New York, so you\u2019re going to work hard to apply for these internships (though the hacker society generally does a great job in preparing and helping you). \n\nOn/off campus jobs are plentiful, and just take a stroll through the career fair and you should find some opportunities. \n\nFor weekends, I know several people who will party, though I\u2019m not familiar with them. You can also enjoy some time in the art museum or severance hall or just take a bus to downtown. Let me know if you want more information, and feel free to dm me",

            "comment": "I'm a civvie myself, but I'm talking with my computer engineering friend right now.\n\nSpecifically about computer engineering, he says that if you're dead set on computer engineering maybe don't go to case for it because the department is very small. The two biggest professors... well, one is stern and demeaning, and the other is senile.  My friend says to consider an electrical major with a computer minor or secondary major.\n\nHowever, related fields(EE and CS) have very good programs, and Case is excellent for engineering in general. \n\nFor your actual questions...\n\n1. Job prospects are great. Obviously the biggest factor is your field, but cleveland is growing and it needs skilled workers. If you're doing CS/programming, silicon valley is the way to go, but cleveland will definitely work for what you're thinking of.\n\n2. On campus jobs... lots of opportunities. Research positions, TAs, receptionists... I'm constantly getting emails about random minimum wage jobs that need filling.\n\n3. There's plenty of stuff to do in cleveland, but case students seldom do that stuff. It's kinda what you make it- you could get really into urban exploration, or pick up a hobby, or do lots of work for clubs like robotics or baja... or you could try to graduate a semester early and spend your weekends with mountains of homework. Though, honestly, depending on your work ethic and luck with professors you might end up doing that anyway.\n\nAlso, my other friend says that if you come here, you should try to get into juniper dorms your first semester, because they're the best freshman dorms by far.\n\nLike the other guy said, dm me with aby other questions.",

My advice to you(and I was in the same exact situation a couple of years ago) is to not think about your specific major too much yet. At the time I was applying, I was very anxious about not knowing what kind of engineering I wanted to do(or if I even wanted to do engineering). But then I discovered civil engineering, and it's not like a love at first sight thing; every I do work for a civil class, I get just a little bit more sure that I want to go into civil. You'll have plenty of time later to figure out exactly what kind of STEM is right for you, and the intro to engineering class does a great job of showing you the different subfields.\n\nGenerally they like to see you declare your major by the end of your third semester, so you've got plenty of time.\n\nOh, I never addressed support networks.... early on, your best support will come from your TAs and professors' office hours(I highly recommend office hours), but I also recommend chatting up some classmates early on and forming a group of people you can study with or ask about the homework.\n\nLater on, though, support strength really varies based on major. I'm personally really liking civil, because the professors are really involved and extremely knowledgable, and there's ton of recruiting and info events because the civil job market's so hot right now.\n\nIf you do decide to come to case, I'd be happy to give you a tour and all that.",

I hear it was so bad this semester that if you didn't show up early you might get stuck sitting in the aisle(it filled up strosacker, an auditorium with room for maybe 500-600 people). I didn't take that class, not because I did well on my AP test, but because I took the Calc 1 proficiency test once I got to case. Those are immensely helpful and surprisingly easy to pass, the main disadvantage being that nobody tells you about them. \n\nThis is a tangent, but no matter where you go, **keep a hawk eye out for proficiency and placement tests**. They're easier than AP tests(usually) and save you time and money. Don't do what I did and retake Mechanics to get a couple of concepts you missed- if you can pass the proficiency test, you can fill in the gaps with youtube.\n\nWhere was I? Oh, right, class sizes. My classes were much more reasonable early on, but still pretty packed... a few hundred students in each one. I'm just about to get out of that phase, but I predict it might be even more packed when you show up, because CWRU admin is trying to make the campus bigger, and they still haven't got the logistical infrastructure to split up the biggest classes.\n\nAs you know, later on classes get much smaller- I'm almost at that point in civil... my intro to civil engineering class maybe had 40 people in it. Most of the civil classes have anywhere from 10 to 30 people, depending on the professsor's reputation, mostly.\n\nOn your second question, what do you mean specifically by \"doubts\"? Like, trouble with the course material? Or, advice about majors and your general college plan?\n\nGeneral professor availability is pretty good... there's office hours and email, and office hours are generally a great way to get help or have conversations, as long as you can get over the hurdle of summoning the willpower to do it.\n\nI can't speak for other majors, but civil really has a great support network because the professors are always chilling out somewhere in the building where all your classes are, so you can casually strike up a conversation with them about anything, including asking for advice or help.",

It isn't much better than asking professors or TAs in terms of actually learning the material best, but it requires less motivation and effort, so you're more likely to get a lot of help that way.

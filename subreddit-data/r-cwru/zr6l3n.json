    "postText": "I am absolutely disappointed that CWRU decided not to share any more details/ a statement regarding the assault incident that happened on Friday. Further, I am incredibly heartbroken that the report made it seem as though no members of the CWRU community were involved when in fact they were staff members and a student. I understand this information may be a part of an ongoing investigation; however, there were details that could have been shared\u2014 hence the local news report detailing this incident. The fact that no statement has been sent to the community (specifically the student body as I\u2019m sure staff were informed) does not sit right with me. As students we deserve to know safety information that may be relevant to us regardless of the timing (as in, I understand finals is stressful and sharing this info could\u2019ve been disheartening).\n\nUnfortunately I feel like this is just another one of the time\u2019s CWRU will do anything to save their pride/ what little reputation they have left to avoid being put in the spotlight again for something they dropped the ball on.\n\nIf you are curious to know more information about Fridays incident I suggest you look up the details in the local cleveland news. My best wishes are with the families of the individuals who were victims of this assault.",

Yes, technically the housekeeper wasn't a resident of Triangle, but she was working inside. This disregards the students he also assaulted that went and left UH before the alert was sent (they're not at the hospital anymore, right?). Glad the FOX8 article is telling us what we should've learned from the DPS itself.\n\n\nBizarre that the school is trying so hard to cover it up. No one is sympathetic to the assaulter.",

There was no alert at the time of assault (they fail to alert us of many imminent threats) and they\u2019re yet to address the student body on this issue. I\u2019ve been slowly losing faith in this place",

Also disheartening that over the past few days I\u2019ve had to piece together what happened by word of mouth, not from any official case source (just saw the news post today). Wishing the victims a safe and healthy recovery.",

This would\u2019ve been a great time to issue a shelter in place/ lockdown notification to avoid the area.\n\nAdditionally, though this may feel like an isolated incident that doesn\u2019t need to be addressed, I\u2019m sure staff expects/deserves to be informed of how the university will do better at protecting them while they\u2019re doing their job. How the university will be addressing issues of drugs on campus. Improving safety in general + notifications/communication.\n\nI think the lack of communication altogether with this event seems a little off to many of us. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s CWRU or DPS\u2019 place to decide what is \u201crelevant\u201d information for us to know. It all needs to be reported and communicated so that we are aware and can make decisions for ourselves moving forward. And yes, I am aware of the criminal reporting logs on the DPS website, but major events like this deserve our attention.",

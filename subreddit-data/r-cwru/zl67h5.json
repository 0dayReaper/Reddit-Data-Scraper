            "comment": "Google Workspace for Education is $3 / student / year.  Case Western graduates about 5,000 new alumni every year.  Let's be generous and ignore that class sizes have grown substantially over the last few decades.  GMail was introduced in 2004 so 18 x 5000 = at most about 90,000 alumni currently using this, costing the university $270,000/yr or about as much as four students worth of tuition and fees.\n\nYou are all getting screwed over for a rounding error on the Case bookkeeping that, over the course of your lifetime, will amount to less than 0.1% of what you paid to attend.  It's the absolute worst kind of nickel-and-diming where it's going to cause a gigantic headache for thousands of people just to save the tech department a smidgeon of money.\n\nThe monetary value of the time wasted for thousands of high-earning Case alumni who will have to deal with this mess exceeds the amount of money Case will save by several orders of magnitude.  If they piss off enough alumni, then the monetary value of the donations lost will also dramatically exceed the amount of money Case saves.\n\nAnd the worst part is that plenty of us would probably be willing to pay $3 to keep these accounts active, but Case Western is too lazy to give us that option.",

(Yes, if Case ITS upgraded its data allotments, it would not have this issue.) \n\nI don't believe we are losing access to our case \\[dot\\] edu email accounts. Are we?",

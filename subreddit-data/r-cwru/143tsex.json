    "postText": "Pretty much, I was really terrified of doing my housing application and I didn't even want to check my CWRU application portal as I didn't ever turn in my photo and just procrastinated it until today when I just realized I was 2 days late for the \"deadline\" of June 5th. I just got my CaseOneCard photo approved but the housing application won't show me any links (i.e. \"Link to photo upload page\" on \"Apply to Housing\" tab with no link). I'm really worried, but to be honest, I realize that I reap what I sow and I'm even alright with a random roommate.",

I recieved a financial aid offer of 57k, which included a university scholarship of  $24,500 as well as a $32,340 CWRU grant.\n\nAre these awards subject to change going forward if I become a student at Case or does it remain the same? \n\nIt is possible for me to explain my financial situation to the Financial aid office and expect more financial aid from Case? What has y'alls experience been with Case giving you more aid?",

Case claims to meet 100% of demonstrated need, and if that changes year to year then so will the grant. Like all colleges, there is a disconnect between what you actually need and what they say you need. Additionally, if you are selected for donor scholarships / grants, they simply take away aid from the CWRU grant and add aid in the amount of the scholarship. \n\nBecause Case meets what they claim to be 100% of need, they won't give anymore than they initially allot.\n\nHope this helps.",

For outside scholarships, you're supposed to report them but technically you don't have to (against their rules but I doubt they'd actually find out / care). For scholarships like donor grants or anything that gets sent to case directly, they'll obviously find out. I believe they reduce loans first, but you can ask to maintain maximum loan amount possible.\n\nI'd direct these questions to financial aid themselves as they'll be able to give you a more precise answer.",

Although we got clearance a week before and tried our best to accommodate any requests we were given, we probably should have heeded more warning to make sure we weren't disrupting anything too important.\n\nIf anyone happens to have questions, feel free to ask em in this thread.",

It would have probably been a lot less intrusive if the music was outside like we intended to be honest.",

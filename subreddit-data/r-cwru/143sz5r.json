How has your experience been and have you experienced any racism? I'll only be here for the summer so I just wanted to know what I should expect. I am coming from California, so I do know Ohio is already less diverse than California.",

It's the most ethnically and racially diverse city in Ohio.  \n\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics\\_of\\_Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Cleveland)  \n\n\nEnjoy your summer!",

As others have mentioned the neighborhood demos have changed and you are less likely to run into that now than 15-20 years ago.",

Also, the university is made up of quite a few POC as well. Besides cwru students are very accepting anyway regardless of the fact that many of them are POC.",

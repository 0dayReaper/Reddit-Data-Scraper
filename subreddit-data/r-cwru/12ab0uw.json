Can't speak to specific econ major requirements, but Weatherhead offers a good variety of classes for all their programs. Also, their professional resources are incredible. Very easy to find internships, talk to alumni, resume/cover letter prep, etc. Huge focus on experiential learning (including in club settings), which I think is really valuable and sets CWRU students apart.",

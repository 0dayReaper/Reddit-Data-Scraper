    "postText": "Hello folks, I have received admission for MS CS program at Case Western Reserve University for this fall. Case western has great ranking and a good reputation in the research area, but how is the program really for MS?\n\nI haven\u2019t received any scholarship and the tuition itself will cost 65000$. I am in touch with a professor regarding a Research assistant\u2019s post, but it can\u2019t be confirmed and even if I get the post, I believe I won\u2019t be getting a tuition assistance, only monthly stipend. \n\nI have seen the course work and the courses are rigorous. I wanna know like is it worth it, since I also have an admit from University at Buffalo and there the fees is 40% less. The only con here is the class size(616 students just in CS program compared to 576 in whole school of engineering at case), 18 months course(12 credit\u2019s minimum instead of 9 at case) and huge crowd of Indian students(77% of MS students are Indian at UB). \n\nAny tips or insights will be appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "Rumor on the street is that CS has one of the worst stipend / tuition situations in all of the Case School of Engineering. As you wrote, your PI has a ton of power about how much / whether you get paid. I'd think twice about CS at Case. Other departments within CSE (ChemE, MatE, MechE) have more standardized stipend / tuition coverage, but CS and CivE students have had issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should definitely calculate opportunity cost, too. Paying $65k when you could be earning $65k+ is a huge cost. Think twice, again.",

Most MS students don't do internships; in the summer they do research full-time... assuming they are on the research track. If you do the courses track, you won't have the same interactions with a PI so it seems less likely they could help you.",

Cause if you are just doing it for the degree and courses, with similarly ranked programs, it makes sense to go to the 40% cheaper one. But if you are determined on research, then the \"match-ness\" with your PI will rule over almost everything (especially given MS programs are relatively short and you likely can't afford to rotate to another PI).",

Both research and job hunting are time-consuming tasks; it is rare to see students who do well in both, but it is really easy to get overwhelmed and subsequently fail in both.\n\nAlso, I won't claim I know every aspect of Case CS' job finding, but it sounds like misinformation that Case is able to \"help students get internships through their tie up companies.\" CMIIW.Yes, the tech industry in the greater Cleveland area is growing, and firms around here recognize Case's reputation, making it easier to land a local internship. However, there's no way to help that many students land internships, and there aren't that many firms \u2014 with a Case ID, you can go on handshake and check out the employee list of career fairs for a start.\n\nI talked about MSCS job landing in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cwru/comments/10avtvi/comment/j46wa1e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). It is more geared towards an international OP so I am not sure if you are one, but many properties of small firms may still apply.\n\nGiven Buffalo is likely cheaper than (Case tuition - Case research stipend) \u2014 which you don't know how much and are not sure if you'd get one at all \u2014 I think you should carefully research the pros/cons of two program offerings. LinkedIn Alumni can be a good indicator for job landing.",

Even if that's something Case can do (which I don't think so), many small firms don't sponsor h1b, so they have low incentives to hire international interns. I believe even Progressive \u2014 one of the bigger firms that show up at Case's career fair \u2014 doesn't sponsor interns.\n\nI don't know much about on-campus jobs like librarian and dining. But it is fairly common to see international students work as TAs. When I was TAing the rate was $13/hr, you are capped at 20 hrs/week but usually require less. So at most, you'd make \\~$1k a month; I won't say it is enough.",

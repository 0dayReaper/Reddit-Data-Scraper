    "postText": "I am currently a graduate student at CWRU in the College of Arts and Sciences that recently defended my PhD and overall had a very positive experience. I am still a graduate student and getting paid by the University till the end of August and have not yet received my diploma. However, on July 31, CWRU cancelled my health insurance in the middle of a pandemic, without any warning, a month before I am no longer a graduate student. I tried to get essential prescriptions filled in the first week of August, only to find out that I no longer had insurance. I asked the university to reinstate my insurance through the rest of the time I am a graduate student, but they would not, so I had to pay the full price for the prescriptions and just have to hope that I do not get sick before my next job starts in September. I thought people should be aware Case Western does this to its graduate students.\n\nNot only this, but graduate students\u2019 health insurance lapses every August until the graduate student is able to register for classes. Then, to pay for health insurance, the university borrows \\~ $1300 from it\u2019s students each semester and sometimes takes months to reimburse them. This is an amount which many graduate students do not have laying around as we are often living paycheck to paycheck, so many have to borrow money from family members or friends, which I have had to do several times and find quite humiliating. When I tried to ask the graduate student government why the university did this, they said to avoid paying certain taxes. I can\u2019t confirm this is true, but if it is, then the university is borrowing money from graduate students and putting graduate students\u2019 health at risk by allowing students' health insurance to lapse every August just to get a tax break. I have many friends at other universities and have been a graduate student at another university myself and have never heard of another university that does this to its students.",

            "comment": "Your insurance is tied to your class registration. Since summer courses only run until July 31st and the Fall classes start in August, it makes sense that your insurance is cut off on July 31st. Therefore, your status as a graduate student probably ended on July 31st because you're not registered to Fall 2020 classes. As for why you got paid, I would assume it's because the payrolls are on the last day of each month. Your stipend is spread out throughout the year instead of just Fall and Spring semesters (August-May), meaning that what you got paid for is for July, not August.\n\nAs for cutting insurance during middle of a pandemic, it's shitty but it seems more procedural that they wouldn't have to cover for someone that is no longer a student of the university. I understand it's frustrating, but I would expect this from any other universities.",

A PhD student is employed by the university for their research/teaching duties, so why should the insurance be tied to registration?  The period of employment doesn't necessarily overlap with the semester; thesis defenses can be scheduled for any time, and it isn't uncommon (at least in the sciences) to stay on well past the defense date to finish up work as a research assistant. And regardless of the current situation, an employee should be notified that their coverage will lapse on a certain date, and be given an opportunity to extend their benefits without subsidization through a transition period. I think this is actually mandated under the COBRA act?\n\nI've always found this policy where Case makes you front the money for the insurance kind of sketchy..",

I don't know how the the insurance works for the cases you mentioned above.\n\nHonestly, PhD students are in a weird limbo status between student and employee, and we get treated as whichever one is more favorable to the university at a time. I absolutely agree about the notification of the coverage. I don't know enough about the legal side on the COBRA act to have any comments, but it sounds very reasonable to get the opportunity to extend the benefits during the transition period.",

It seems that once you leave the student \"class\" under health insurance, your status changes and you cannot be insured under the same conditions. It is likely a term of the insurance, rather than a tax matter. (In this case specifically. Why Grad students in the USA are not treated as works \\*is\\* tax related, however.)  \n\n\nWe were able through working with our admin extend health insurance for recent grads (this year only!) until the end of August, if they have no other employment. Keep pushing the admin about it, seek other that have had the same experience, and see if there is someway they can otherwise include you.",

My health insurance ran out end of July and yet my next one from my grad school doesn't start until end of August. I ended up purchasing a private insurance from Blue cross for the month of August to at least have some coverage. I would recommend you look into that. You can start the plan and then cancel it once you your insurance kicks off.",

My department sends out reminders around the end of spring semester to register for summer term (the RSCH 750 \"class\" to maintain student status) and fall semester.\n\nAnd what's this about needing to front the money for insurance? My program handles it all behind the scenes with internal transfers and \"payroll deductions\" (as an accounting trick - it has no impact on my stipend), so it's clearly not a university-wide policy.\n\nIt sounds to me like a lot of you are from departments with incompetent administrative staff if they can't figure out how to pay the insurance internally or have you register before August. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

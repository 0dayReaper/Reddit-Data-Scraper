    "postText": "Hello! I was accepted in the cwru and I\u2019m curious about the workload for stem students. I\u2019m going to major in computer science so I\u2019m wondering how difficult it was for any stem majors out there. How would you guys divide your time spent at cwru? For example, you could say something 70% school related (class work etc( and 30% personal (hobbies, extracurriculars etc) ? I want to make sure I can still focus on other things I am passionate about while still being a stem major. \n\nThank you!",

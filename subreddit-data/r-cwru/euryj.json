This is a long shot but here goes.\n\nLast Spring you and and your two buddies were in your SUV stopped at the light  at Murray Hill and Adelbert. It was about three in the morning. You started and your buds started shouting homophobic slurs at my two friends and me. I'm the guy that bee lined to your open driver's seat window and jacked you twice in the face. I remember you being Indian if that narrows it down. I felt pretty cool afterward.\n\nJust wanted to see if you were on Reddit.",

One of my friends told me about this post and I couldn't resist replying and clearing things up. \nYou see I went through a bit of a bizarre phase in my life where I would shout stupid things at complete strangers when I was hammered... while driving. I still don't really know why I did these things, but let's just blame it on the alcohol... In any case I probably deserved that right hook.\nEven for me this one of the most ridiculous and funny stories I have from my time Case. ",

Funny how you want to call yourself the victim when you and your friends were shouting \"GYPSIES\" and borat slurs at us when we drove right by you. \nAnd, I personally want to tell you to meet at the same spot where that happened, so i can slap you in the face with a 3 foot long dildo and also jam it down your throat. I had purchased the 3 foot long dildo hoping that one day you would post on reddit. THAT DAY HATH FINALLY COMETH. So my friend, if your in the mood for a good dildo whacking to the face (I'm pretty sure you always are)  meet me at that same spot at sundown, i'm going to be carrying a beige guitar case on my back to conceal the dildo. The game is on. ",

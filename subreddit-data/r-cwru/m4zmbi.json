    "postText": "When constantino's closed down last year at the start of the pandemic, it left people on north side basically unable to get groceries unless they had a car (or knew someone with a car). Finally, after almost a year, Plum Market (of course owned by bon appetit) is here. \n\nI sort of figured it'd be a bit pricier, but I wasn't expecting it to be as bad it actually was. I went in once, walked around for maybe 5-10 minutes, and left without buying anything. It definitely is basically a Whole Foods, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But when it's some students' only means of getting groceries, that's a bit debilitating.\n\nI wish CWRU would have worked to bring on a more affordable grocery store, but Bon Appetit gonna Bon Appetit.",

And knowing that full we'll, CWRU decides to partner with something so outrageously priced. It's obviously gonna end up closing too but they still leased it to them.",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm an international student who got accepted to case, with 35k grant in financial aid (currently preparing to appeal for more aid). I'm planning to major in bio. \n\nTo be completely honest, I wasn't considering case and didnt show any demonstrated interest, so I was very surprised to see I got in. I can't visit the school, and a lot of opinions I saw online weren't very positive, hence I've been a little worried cause I'm unable to determine whether its the best choice for me. Its the best choice I have, so I'd be grateful if you could answer a few questions!\n\n1. How is the food? I'm a big foodie, so I wanted to know how good is the campus dining? Also, are there a lot of good cafes/restaurants nearby?\n2. Are the dorms relatively good? How do you manage winters and summers?\n3. Bringing to my next question...Why is case said to have bad weather? I live in a tropical country, so I'm pretty ignorant about cold winters.\n4. Are there fun things to do over the weekend in the city? Im not a party person, and I just like relaxing in a park, cute cafes, malls etc. I also like to hike. \n5. I know case is reputed for its strong (and hard) academics. For bio: is it fun? Are there a lot of experimental and study abroad opportunities? \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this long post!",

            "comment": "1. Dining hall food is not great, but there are some good places to eat on campus and the surrounding area. If you're feeling adventurous there are a lot of awesome places in downtown Cleveland.\n\n2. I didn't live in a Freshmen dorm because I was remote because of COVID, but Sophomore dorms are ok condition-wise. Most of the housing is ok-good, except for Clarke Tower. Just don't do Clarke. The freshmen and sophomore dorms do not have A/C so a box fan is heavily recommended. It can get pretty hot during the summer and early fall.\n\n3. Case is said to have bad weather because it's in Cleveland, which gets harsher winters than normal because of Lake Erie and cold winds coming from Canada. If you're coming from a tropical country it will be an adjustment, but it's really not that bad. It can get pretty cold in December-February, but as long as you wear layers you will be ok.\n\n4. You will hear a lot of conflicting answers on this, but I personally love Cleveland. It's not too big where it's intimidating, but there is still stuff to do in the city. If you like sports, Cleveland has a professional football, basketball, and baseball team. Cleveland is a sports city at heart. Other than that, Playhouse Square is super cool (that's where the theatre is), the Flats is awesome, and you also have West Side Market which is super cool to visit as well. Cleveland has all of the stuff that you mentioned as well, specifically the Metro Parks which I'd definitely check out. Case also has a reputation of not having a very good social scene, which is true if you are looking for big parties. There are parties, but they are a lot smaller and pretty tame compared to bigger schools.\n\n5. Case academic experiences vary from major to major, but overall I'd say it's a pretty rewarding experience. You'll get out of it what you put into it. There are a lot of research and study abroad opportunities, and I'd recommend reading more about that if that's something your interested in.",

And  paid internship opportunities for the summer? \nHow much, on average, does one earn via student employment? Would it be realistic to earn around 10k/ year via campus employment?\nMy fin aid package includes loans and employment, and it's still not affordable without taking out loans atm. I'm worried about debt. :'D",

Every semester Case does a virtual career fair and an in-person career fair where you can meet and talk with companies to network and get yourself an internship.\n\nIt would not be realistic to make 10K/year imo. Keep in mind you're taking classes in combination with working. Case also limits the amount of hours you can work a week to 20 if you have a campus job. Wage varies, but you can expect anywhere from $10-$15/hr.",

(We looked at several schools in Amherst including umass, Amherst, Trinity). \n\nUMass is probably cheaper for you. And it\u2019s only a few places below case western. Honestly if you want \u2018best\u2019 by ranking and factoring money and location\u2026 start with UMass. Solid place. \n\nThe other schools aren\u2019t bad either. Iowa is pretty white (not as diverse ethnicity/race in the state). Not familiar with umn but weather (snowy snowy. \ud83e\udd76 cold). \n\nGood luck.",

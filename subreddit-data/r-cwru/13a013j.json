The only problems I had were actually with the asthma and allergy clinic back home not actually sending the vials to them sometimes despite having everything signed to do so. But once they were there, the clinic did a great job. That was back in 2014-2018, though.",

This service has become increasingly specialized, and we believe that students are best served -- and can be most safely accommodated- by receiving these treatments through an allergist or specialty clinic.\"",

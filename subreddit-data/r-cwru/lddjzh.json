    "postText": "To the professors (and graduate students in teaching roles) of CWRU,\n\nI know I don't speak for the entire student body when I say this, but please for the love of all that is holy just please use Canvas. I know many of you don't like it, or think it doesn't make sense. I've had professors try to teach their classes out of Slack, out of Group Me, I even had a professor who tried to set up a Linux server we were expected to connect to regularly and check in order to get our assignments. (You know who you are.) Canvas exists for a reason, and it's an effective tool for consolidating all of our classes and things that need doing, be they discussion boards, homework, or quizzes, into one place. It's not the best system, I acknowledge this, but when it's used well, it makes everyone's lives substantially easier than having to go to some special site or server for every different class we're in. I get that switching to whatever third party system you're using makes *your* life easier, but for the rest of the students in your class, it just adds another layer of inconvenience for us. Pre covid this was already a major inconvenience, but now that all of our communication happens digitally, having everything in one place would just add one less thing we have to worry about and keep track of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, I cannot stress this enough. We're having a hard enough time as it is without having to check four different websites just to make sure our homework planners are accurate.",

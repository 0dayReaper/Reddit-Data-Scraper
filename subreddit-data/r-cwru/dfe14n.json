Parking garages; hospital buildings,etc\n\nThe places I frequented are gone as well: The Brick, Adeles, Dean's Diner, Case Main, Irv's Deli on Coventry.\n\nSpeaking with people somethings are the same:  Workload is oppressive, food service is horrible\n\nI came to Case as one of those guys who never cracked a book in High School; never studied; did homework at the last minute.  Made all A's. Had great SAT scores. \nArrived on campus to find a whole sea of people just like me, only smarter , hardercworking and used to the grind. Hit me like a ton of bricks. Took me a semester and a half to catch on. Eventually did very well academically. \nPartying hard helped me make it through. The drinking age in Ohio was 18 then if I recall correctly. That or the bars and clubs didn't care!  With all the people from New England at Case, I learned how easy it was to get a fake Connecticut Drivers liscence. The few times I got carded, I used that.",

Only ran into one person who I knew-didn't really even know him, nor he me, but we did recognize each other's names. He was EE; I was ChE. We're both retired now; both worked in Engineering all this time. I had six employers (most of them European) he had but two and one was an M&amp;A successor. \nMight be back for Homecoming again next year. Time will tell",

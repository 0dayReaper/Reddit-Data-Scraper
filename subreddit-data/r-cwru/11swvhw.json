You\u2019ll definitely need to put in the work for good grades and students spend lots of time studying. However, it is doable if you have a good work ethic and put in the proper time. Hard to just skate by though so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, reconsider your decision.",

            "comment": "I would say Case is on the upper end of spectrum with academic difficulty and rigor compared to other colleges around the country and the academics are at the level of an ivy league school. I went to a competitive STEM high school and found myself having to put in hours on Friday nights and weekends to prepare for exams (especially in my STEM classes). That being said I was a Biomedical Engineering major and it's considered the most difficult major at Case. I have been a TA for some introductory classes and professors evidently hold their students to a high caliber.\n\nIt's very much possible to earn a solid GPA, but you do have to put in the work to master the material and professors do not hand out A's at this school if you don't know the material enough to earn an A. In the STEM community Case is widely respected for it's graduates and naturally it has to maintain a high level of rigor and academic quality in it's students. \n\nWhat I enjoyed about the professors at Case is that I never found it that a professor was intentionally trying to make students do bad. While some classes have a curve, most professors at this school are okay with **all** their students walking away with an A as long as they have evidently mastered the material . As a result, collaboration among students is encouraged and most students work together. By all means the university does not engage in a cut throat environment as it is stereotyped by STEM heavy schools",

            "comment": "I think you\u2019ll do a lot of differences between classes you take and professors you choose, just like a lot of schools. As a social science student, I was terrified to get some of my required science credits based on the experiences of some friends studying hard sciences, but it really wasn\u2019t any different than any of my regular courses. However, difficulty to maintain a good GPA can vary wildly between programs based on the grading policies various departments adopt, regardless of how academically challenging you find the actual material. But even then, I had friends constantly studying or writing and friends that I swear never opened a book and did fine all in the same program. However, the support systems are pretty good. If you go to class and participate/pay attention, I\u2019ve encountered very few profs who aren\u2019t willing to help you outside of class. And even fewer of these professors seem \u201cout to get you\u201d or pride themselves on having \u201cthe most difficult class\u201d or some boloney like that.",

If you\u2019re a procrastinator or repeatedly don\u2019t go to class, assignments may seem impossible. There is no such thing as cruising through Case Western.",

            "comment": "Also a BS in bio here in my junior year, there are a lot of geneds in our track and a hell of a lot of chem, but it\u2019s manageable. It helps to get physics over with during the summer if you can. Other than that, it\u2019s really just managing your time, realizing it\u2019s usually impossible to truly spend the amount of time you need to on all classes, and avoiding hard classes. Few people are actively competing, but many think academics are their entire lives and hate themselves if they get a low B on an exam",

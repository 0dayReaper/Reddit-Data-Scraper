    "postText": " Hello!\n\nBeen trying to budget my costs, and I'm trying to find a realistic amount I can expect to make working at case western, working average hours via on-campus employment \\[My parents are paying the billable expenses, but they asked me to manage personal expenses by working\\]. \n\nThat said, if I live frugally enough, how much do you think will be my avg personal expense per year?\n\nAlso, how difficult is it to get paid internships from the 2nd year? I'm planning to major in systems biology.\n\nAnd if anybody could explain the CPT and OPT opportunities, I'd be grateful!\n\nI've been allotted a \"$2500 through campus employment\" on my financial aid package, and I'm trying to see if how viable it would be to earn more.",

You could potentially TA multiple courses or work a desk job plus TA. I think by the end I was earning $12/hour, but I am not sure if there is a difference between international students and not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is CWRU's link to their info: [https://case.edu/international/international-student-services/employment-training/f-1-student-employment-and-training](https://case.edu/international/international-student-services/employment-training/f-1-student-employment-and-training).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can also probably reach out to the student employment office: [stu-emp@case.edu](mailto:stu-emp@case.edu)  \n\n\nStudent Employment Handbook: https://case.edu/financialaid/sites/case.edu.financialaid/files/2021-10/FinancialAidStudentEmployment.pdf",

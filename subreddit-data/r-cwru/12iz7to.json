            "comment": "You can rent a storage unit with a couple of friends.\n\nExtra storage at Downtown is the least expensive option, but a lot of their units are harder to access. And they ask you to buy insurance, but you just can say you have it and they won't care.\n\nCompass at Shaker Heights is another good choice, I once rent a 10' x 15' unit with 6 friends and it took me \\~$500 in total. Including rental fees of uhaul and boxing materials and everything you can name, we spent \\~$800. Note that We are all international students so we have much more stuff than the locals do. Generally, you don't need such a big unit at all. If you are by yourself, maybe the smallest 5' x 3' is big enough already, those are \\~$60 per month.\n\nHere is a picture at Compass, I actually regret to rent this large a unit, we could have stack the boxes. But anyways, it's much cheaper than the dorm mover.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1zr4NH6GNjckUTHfZVUbB7I8Y9Gb1iGMb/view?usp=share\\_link",

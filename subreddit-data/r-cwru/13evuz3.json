    "postText": "Hi I'm a female computer Science Major. I'm Nigerian. I'm currently looking for a roommate.\n\nMy lifestyle preferences:\nSMOKING/NON-SMOKING HABITS\nObjects to a smoking roommate\n\nROOM ATMOSPHERE\nRoom is a relaxing social area: I would like people to hangout here sometimes. But not all the time. Privacy is important to me.\n\nBEDTIME\nGo to bed from 10pm to 2am. I don't really care when my roommate goes to bed. As long you aren't noisy when I'm asleep. \nAlthough I would prefer if lights are off when it's time to sleep, I'm fine either way.\n\nROOM CLEANLINESS\nRoom is lived-in and casual\nI'm slightly messy, but it's always limited to my corner of the room. I'm used to living with people since I've shared a room all my life.\n\nDorms in order of preference: Taplin, any other Juniper dorm, Raymond \n\nI have asthma, so I dislike scented candles and strong air fresheners. I don't mind light and weak fragrances if that's your thing. \n\nPartners/ significant others: I don't mind you having her/him/them over, just let me know in advance. I'd rather not walk in on something unsuspectingly. \n\nThanks. Nice to meet you all\u2764\ufe0f",

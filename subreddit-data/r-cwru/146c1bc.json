Most people I know had keurigs. Just be discrete with it and be sure to unplug it when you\u2019re done. \n\nCoffee makers need an automatic shut off\n\nThe school has all these rules to keep people safe. I wish I were kidding when we had a fire alarm at 4 am because someone tried to make Mac and cheese in the microwave with no water.",

    "postText": "Coming to Case this Fall and planning on majoring in Sociology. How is the department here? Not much information in the past. One from 8 years ago saying it was a great major especially in the medical field, but another from 4 years ago saying it was a very small department and not well known now. Any ideas?",

            "comment": "I was a sociology major at Case. I'm also about to start med school in a couple weeks. Happy to discuss!\n\nSociology is pretty big at Case, as the field is adjacent to both the social work element of the Mandel School for Applied Social Sciences and the quantitative element of all the statistical research on campus. Not many schools have either of those elements in as large an emphasis as Case does. I think the department's biggest strengths are in the Sociology of the Life Course/Gerontology and in medical sociology. But there's also tons of cool work on urban and global-scale inequality here, with professors of international renown for their observational work. That was my favorite side of the department. \n\nAt the same time, despite the magnitude of these resources, sociology always \"felt\" small. Case defines itself as a STEM school, and I think a natural camaraderie develops in departments outside those fields. We're all trying to survive in hostile territory \ud83d\ude00 I still keep in touch with multiple professors, and I loved how accessible the seminars felt.",

Med schools really don't care about your major.\n\nI found Case pre-med super supportive, and the classes/professors felt fair. Hard for me to rank the pre-med experience, as I've only ever attended two colleges, but my very uneducated understanding is that Case premeds' rates of admission to med school are around that top 20 range among national universities. The exceptional access to clinical opportunities at nearby hospitals really set Case apart to me--it was wonderful not having to cram my clinical hours into short breaks at home because, say, there wasn't a big hospital by my school.",

    "postText": "Hi I was recently accepted to CWRU. They offered me a really generous amount of gift aid because I am a very low income student (&lt;10k/y) so I was wondering if my financial status doesn't change over the 4 years, am I guaranteed to receive the same offer each time I reapply? I really need to know because the aid offered for my first year brings my COA down to the same amount my family makes per year so we'll just be barely getting by paying for the first year. If somehow the aid offered in the 2nd, 3rd Or 4th year decreases I don't want to run into any financial troubles. I really want to attend Case.",

            "comment": "Some scholarships are guaranteed for 4 years. You need to read the details of your award.  \nBut in general, Need-based financial aid is basically the same system for all 4 years. If you can graduate with modest loans that can be paid off within 10 years, you will be doing well.",

I seem to also remember hearing about students spilling out into the hallways while awaiting math tutoring (and then helping each other there).  Maybe a CWRU student can speak to how Case compares in these aspects.\n\nThe parenting community seemed supportive.  They lovingly refer to their students as \"Rosies\".  There's a local guy who fixes all the students' cars. I remember hearing that students don't bother to secure their laptops and other possessions because nothing gets stolen.  They drop everything in a pile before entering the dining hall. That's about all I recall!\n\nThe location is another major difference.",

It seems like somewhere you can constantly get LAC-style small classes, which IMO is one of the most important factors for undergrad learning. However, Case is pretty small and teaching-focused compared to a lot of \"strong STEM schools\" as well. Also, looks like Rose's CS profs are not doing much CS research (not saying this is the exclusive standard, but they are not even on csrankings), and Case's location should have more to explore/enjoy for being urban.",

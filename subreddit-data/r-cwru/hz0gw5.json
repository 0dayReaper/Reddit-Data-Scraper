I'm sure they'll keep this one locked down given COVID, but in '04 it was extremely difficult for students to get tickets. Think it was like Student Government and the rest of the tickets were given to local electeds and doled out by state and local political parties. That said, we got to be volunteers (ushers) for it via the Poll Sci Dept. It was really cool to be there, but of course now I get to look back on the time I watched Dick Cheney and John Edwards debate (both of who are objectively terrible people).  \n\n\nAll to say, again, I doubt students (or anyone) will be able to go and see it, but if they do let folks in, your best chance into the Hall would be to reach out to the PoliSci dept if you're in that major or taking classes.",

Gee I sure wonder why all those other schools decided not to host. I don\u2019t understand why the debate can\u2019t be held online. It honestly seems like something that could so easily be moved to an electronic platform.",

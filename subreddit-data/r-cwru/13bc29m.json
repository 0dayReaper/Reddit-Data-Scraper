    "postText": "Dear Redditors,\n\nAs a non-specialized grad student, I'm seeking advice on math and statistics classes for Fall 2023. Although I have the option to take any science class to fulfill my requirements, I prefer math and statistics because they are areas I'm more comfortable with.\n\nI'm looking for classes that will provide me with a solid foundation in mathematical and statistical concepts. Ideally, the classes would be offered at a graduate level.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or advice on what classes to take or what to look for when choosing math or statistics classes, please share your thoughts. I'm eager to learn and make the most of these required classes.\n\nThank you in advance for your help and guidance!",

            "comment": "There are many posts about Case CS \u2014 e.g., [\\#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cwru/comments/11v505q/cs_at_case/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [\\#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cwru/comments/ty5vpa/questions_by_a_prospective_student/), and [\\#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cwru/comments/11w4ji1/decision_guidance_for_cs_rpi_umd_or_case_western/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) are some good ones I have come across \u2014 and based on the repetitiveness of content, I feel like enough has been said in that department.\n\nRegarding Purdue vs. Case, my HS buddy went to Purdue for CS and we'd agree it is pretty much the typical small private school vs. large public school debate. Purdue has a much larger program with more profs, course options/sessions, and students. Yet Case is more focused with smaller class sizes, a stronger emphasis on teaching, closer prof-student relationships, and more flexibility on major-switching/double-major kinds of things. Both programs are considered to be rigorous, but Purdue is much higher ranked, and from what I can tell, it is more hardcore on some traditionally hardcore subjects (os, network, etc.). Both got lame career fairs.\n\nFor AI/ML, learning-wise both schools lay good fundamentals. But neither has broad course offerings on the new-new, and neither is considered particularly strong in AI. Still, Purdue has  stronger labs in terms of research output \u2014 that attract more competitive phd students, which can snowball into a more structured undergraduate research roadmap. Case is growing in its AI focus, got a great HPC, and you can potentially seek out external research opportunities (by yourself or via prof's connections). As someone who did ML research at Case, I'd go Case again for its intimacy, but I will definitely branch out to other schools for Summer research to get more hands-on advices and rec letters.\n\nThere's more to life than learning. Location-wise Case is considered better because it is urban, but West Lafayette/Lafayette is not the middle of a cornfield either. Meanwhile, Purdue hits a higher social score with its sports achievements and school spirit.",

            "comment": "Case offers a highly-regarded Computer Science program with numerous courses and research opportunities in AI and machine learning.  AI and machine learning is generally done with\nan interdisciplinary approach, so you\u2019ll have opportunities to collaborate with experts in related fields. CWRU has a strong commitment to experiential learning and is home to several research centers and institutes focused on AI and machine learning. Its location in Cleveland provides access to a growing tech industry and numerous internship and job opportunities in AI and machine learning.   \nCons: relatively high tuition. Some people don\u2019t like Cleveland, but I think it\u2019s a bias based on stereotype rather than reality.  \nI think Case is the better school.",

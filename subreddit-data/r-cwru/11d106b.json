    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m a student at John Carroll University and am very interested in the 3+3 program we have with CWRU Law School. The 3+3 program is essentially a dual admission program with CWRU Law where you graduate from JCU junior year and start at CWRU senior year for your first year of law.\n\nI came across a couple CWRU posts on Reddit and thought I would post this question! What is it actually like being a CWRU student (undergrad or graduate because I would technically be the same age as an older undergrad senior -22 ish)? What is CWRU Law School like? It is worth it? How easy is it to get involved on campus and what is your student body like? Do you think there is an disadvantages of going to law school a year early? \n\nI would gratefully accept any advice or thoughts from anyone on this platform! \ud83d\ude0a I have a few friends that attend CWRU but have grown distant with them and honestly don\u2019t feel too comfortable asking them this out of left field as I feel that they would brush me off. \n\nI haven\u2019t made any permanent decisions yet as I am only a second semester freshman but I am very focused and passionate about being a lawyer and my only other option would be Cleveland state and even though it is a great law school as well I would prefer CWRU. I feel like college is honestly a lot different experience then what my parents had lol.\n\nThank you! Have a nice day/night! :)",

What you should do is contact the admissions office and see if they'll connect you with them, since that would be the best person for you to talk to.",

I think you should ask yourself what \u2018worth it\u2019 means to accelerate and go a year early. Do you want to save tuition money? Work sooner? Pass the bar sooner? Go to case vs other law school.\n\nAs a \u201cgrown up\u201d, I look back wistful on those years in school as a gift. When I was younger I couldn\u2019t wait to be an independent adult. As an adult, I miss a simpler time when I didn\u2019t have as much responsibility. \n\nI have a friend who finished undergrad early and went to law school early (Elons first graduating class). She didn\u2019t miss a beat and was fine. Loved it. No regrets. \n\nFigure out what you would value about it and it might be worth it. Sounds like you have great choices.",

            "comment": "I think if law school is your short term goal, your decision should revolve around what kind of law schools can you get into without doing any kind of program (so basically your LSAT + GPA). Then you weight the schools you'd likely get into via standard admission against the benefits of saving a year of time &amp; spent less effort on LSAT. If you are a freshman, now might be the perfect time to grind out LSAT and gauge yourself.\n\nIs there any reason that CSU and Case are the only two options? Have to be local?",

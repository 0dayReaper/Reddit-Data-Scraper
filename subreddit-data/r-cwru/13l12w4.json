    "postText": "Recently, I was offered admission from Oberlin's waitlist for the Fall 23. Oberlin and Case having upper hands over each other for different factors are causing the confusion. The financial aid packages are very similar and so finance is not a deciding factor here.\n\nMy intended major is Computer Science. Although I have no plans for double major, my target has always been to get a well-rounded education (which I think I will get at both places). I plan to at least pursue a Master's on CS (not sure about PhD for now). Important to mention, I have no interest in Academia i.e. being a faculty. I have immense interest in working in managerial positions in tech giants. Looking forward to FANGS and such (Please mention which among Case and Oberlin has better industrial connections to the FANGS for my internship placement and job). I also want to settle in the USA (not sure if this point helps while giving advice)\n\nThe confusion rises because Oberlin has similarly strong CS faculty and for the better teaching, one on one relationship with professors, Oberlin has an upper hand. On the other hand, Case being a research university, seems to have more funding for research, for research topics  and \"maybe better\" overall research opportunities (top notch research for bioscience, really cannot say about CS, so looking forward to comments). For internship and career prospects in CS, I seriously cannot compare between Oberlin &amp; Case.\n\nBeing an international student, I cannot visit both campuses and try to catch the vibe. Please help me decide.",

            "comment": "Case is more of an urban school. I\u2019m a Case alum, btw, graduated in the 2010s. I was a humanities/social science major. I got a good, solid education and made some nice friends. Case also commands a good reputation for employment IF you stay in Ohio. Oberlin on the other hand is more liberal arts, more of that college-y feel, and like you said probably more 1:1 attention from professors. Also, Fwiw, oberlin is probably  a safer campus. \n\nI would argue that neither is really \u201cknown\u201d for computer science, with case maybe having an edge there since it is a technical and engineering-heavy school. I can\u2019t speak to fangs because idk what that is.\n\nhonestly, I see so many people spend so much time agonizing over a school (I did the same!) when quite frankly in the grand scheme of life it matters close to nothing. Pick something that has the \u201cmust haves\u201d on your list and that you could see yourself enjoying. At the end of the day, you can always change your major, change your school, try a different grad school, etc. it\u2019s about what you do with the experience and how you take advantage what the school offers.",

            "comment": "I'm a rising senior majoring in CS at Case. Don't know much about Oberlin, but I do know it's a liberal arts college while Case has more of a STEM vibe. At Case you can take classes in basically any department regardless of major, so if you want a well rounded education, you can still take classes outside of engineering.\n\nYou mentioned you plan on doing a masters in CS. Case has a 4+1 program where you can stay one extra year to do your masters. I know a ton of engineering students take advantage of this. And they basically let everyone into the 4+1 program.\n\nAs for FAANG, Oberlin and Case aren't target schools for that. But at Case there are still people who get internships and full time jobs at FAANG and other notable companies. Off the top of my head, I know Case students who have interned/worked at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Capital One, NASA, etc. Again, not a target school by any means, but you can still land a good CS job going to Case.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing where Case CS majors go to grad school or work after graduation, Case posts a first destination survey for all majors with this information here: [first destination survey](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cwru.office.of.institutional.research/viz/StudentOutcomes2022_2/PrimaryPlans).\n\nIf research is important to you, Case is an excellent option. Research is very accessible here and you can start doing research freshman year if you want. I do research in the BME department which involves training ML models to detect cancer. I know CS majors who have done research in AI, robotics, dark matter, 3D printing, video games for rehabilitation, etc.\n\nTo be honest, if you work hard you'll probably be successful at either school. I would definitely try and get an opinion from an Oberlin student as well. But I can say that I've really enjoyed my time as a CS major at Case. Best of luck with your decision!",

            "comment": "So you are an international student who wants to land a big tech job, and you are good with taking a MS degree. If this is your roadmap, honestly, I don't think your choice of undergraduate institution matters much. Because you really don't need much research experience for most SDE-type roles, yet your chances of landing your first job at big tech are mostly determined by whether you'd get the opportunity to do the interview and do it well. So outsides the few colleges who can ask big tech to offer on-campus interviews to their students, your (in this case, MS) school brand and resume are the main drive.\n\nThat being said, I understand that many CS students would like to have a lick of research because 1) It is fun and accomplishing; 2) With the recent progress of foundational models, we'd expect many ordinary software services to have a share of their AI recipe. Given AI/ML is a field that's changing drastically, you might need some field ownership to land solid product deployments. Research definitely helps you build such ownership; 3) It helps grad school applications (though LAC are often pretty good on this as well).\n\nIf this is your thinking, go Case. Oberlin has a tiny CS faculty pool with many of them not active in research. Also, if [this article](https://octet.oberlin.edu/?page_id=6335) is an up-to-date reflection of their computing power, then [Case's HPC](https://thedaily.case.edu/artificial-intelligence-supercomputer-to-accelerate-research-at-case-western-reserve-university/) blows it out of the water. Case is especially strong in bioinformatics due to its vicinity with CCF, and is having an increasing impact on hot fields like AI/ML with its excellent HPC and new faculty hires.",

            "comment": "CWRU seems to me to be an obvious better choice for engineering-related disciplines like computer science. Your CS degree from CWRU comes from the Case School of Engineering which is very well-regarded. Hell, the guy who invented Gmail [went here and gave the Commencement address back in 2012](https://thedaily.case.edu/gmail-creator-cwru-alum-paul-buchheit-to-deliver-his-own-message-at-commencement/).\n\nOberlin is a great school, but if you put two graduates in front of me for the jobs I'm usually hiring for (data science, analytics, software engineering) I'm going to probably select the CWRU person, simply because of the rigor of the CSE. Obviously I'm biased because I went here, but I just can't see selecting Oberlin over CWRU for engineering or sciences.\n\nWith that said...I went to CWRU fully intending to get an astronomy degree and then off to get a PhD, and I ended up with a degree in philosophy. Which is to say that sometimes plans change and it's hard to anticipate every outcome. So while CWRU is a really robust and solid engineering program, that doesn't make it 100% the best place to attend.\n\nIf you're really sure you'll major in comp sci and follow that path, then I think CWRU has advantages over Oberlin. But ultimately you should pick the place that feels best to you. Other commenters have explained the difference in cultures across the campuses, which I'd definitely keep in mind. And I'm definitely not a fan of how everyone getting a comp sci degree at CWRU has to take the full engineering core curriculum. But that's the price of getting your degree from the CSE, I suppose!",

There is a strong LGBT-current driving a majority of campus life. Nothing wrong with anyone's gender identity or preference, but the forceful mainstreaming of gender-identity acceptance could be too much for those, who, while agnostics or tolerant, do not necessarily want to be encouraged (almost to the point of peer-pressured) to declare their pronouns as part of their identity (she/he/they thing). If you are an open-minded person but don't want these things to be surrounding you a lot, it's not for you.",

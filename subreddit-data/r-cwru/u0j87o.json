    "postText": "Like I understand, Cleveland doesn't have as many things to do as [insert whatever metropolitan area you\u2019re from], but no one argued that it did. You did your research when you chose to come to school in *shudder* Cleveland.\n\n\nWhy does it feel like no one here even gives this school/city a chance? It's like we have anti-school spirit. I've talked to my friends attending other schools, and sure they shit on their unis occasionally, but not nearly to the extent we do. Students here are so happy to tell you how much they hate the place, it's almost their entire personality. But if you ask them, they struggle to say anything beyond a couple tired statements (nothing to do here, food sucks). \n\n\nIt's honestly kind of strange. I'm from a *very* metropolitan area relative to Cleveland and have found it fairly easy to adjust to this place. The school and the city have their issues, that is undeniable, but it's not bad by any means. The education is solid, research opportunities are plentiful, food is pretty good if you use swipes, and housing is comparable to universities we compete with. University Circle has a shit-ton of stuff to explore. And once you go outside of the bubble of U.C., there's so much more. I feel like so many people are locked in the headspace of hating the school/city, they won't even try to open up to what it has to offer. If you're a STEM student especially, Case/Cleveland has everything you need to succeed.\n\n\nI feel like part of it is because Case was a lot of people's \"target\" school when they failed to get into their reaches. I've talked to a lot of students here who feel like they made a compromise to attend this place. \"If X happened / didn't happen, I could've been at [T20] rn.\" \n\n\nIt's unfortunate. As someone who actually likes this place, the constant negativity in conversations/social media can get irritating. CWRU doesn't deserve all the bashing.",

I feel like all my friends are constantly hating on the school saying how they're embarrassed to be here or how they got waitlisted at xyz school. I was talking with a bunch of spring admits this semester, and all of them were saying how they were gonna try and transfer literally before classes had even started. Sure, Case isn't the best school in the world, but it's still a privilege to be here at all. Like if you hate the school so much, why did you choose to come here? Obviously there are people who dislike the school and transfer because it's not the right fit for them, and that's understandable. But I definitely agree that we have an anti-school spirit here overall.",

I feel like there are things to be justifiably critical of the school for such as never offering enough USNA courses and the whole housing fiasco earlier in the semester so I don't begrudge anyone for being critical of the uni.\n\nHowever, being critical is not the same as hating and bashing the school and I do often interact with people who hate it here because they feel they belong somewhere better and that attitude does get tiresome very, very quickly.\n\nI think it doesn't help that there is very little to actual be spirited about at CWRU. Sports aren't a big part of the culture and we have about 0 name recognition outside the region, so there really aren't ever any of the things that drive school spirit and positive conversation about the place that exist at other schools.",

Like do the general CS students know where did LeCun, Hinton, Bengio, or anyone of the CLRS graduate? At least I mostly don't.   \nI do know where most of them work right now, and that does help with name recognition. But unfortunately, we don't have that caliber of faculty at Case CS yet \u2014 though this is kind of the norm of top 40-ish non-public schools anyway.\n\n  \n*(Don't get me wrong, I love Case, and I think our CS program is pretty decent with many wonderful profs. Given the small student body, I think the education experience at Case is likely to be better than many comparable alternatives; yet many students take it for granted.)*",

Any kind of bridge over Euclid would be ridiculously out-of-place for the entire area and just a really bad eyesore. Beyond that, it would only ever be a temporary solution. The only way Euclid will stop being a wall that cuts through campus is if the city somehow gets the state to cut it down to 2 lanes from 4, with real protected bike lanes and a sheltered median like outside Thwing, as well as a reduced speed limit or one that's actually enforced to the current 25 mph. \n\nCleveland also seems to be pivoting towards better pedestrian/bike/public transportation infrastructure (there's now a big push to redevelop around the lake), and the whole University Circle corridor is super important to the city. So who knows, maybe in a pie in the sky future, the stretch of Euclid that runs through Case/Uptown will be [closed off and pedestrianized](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A13KNN/tram-passing-through-the-pedestrian-zone-in-frechen-near-cologne-nrw-germany-2A13KNN.jpg), but doubtful.",

Also the Euclid ave that we know today came way after Western Reserve/Case existed, so in that way it's Euclid that came along later and divided the area. \n\nRight now, Euclid is pretty much wasted space to anyone who's not in a car. Making Euclid far less of a barrier, where pedestrians have only like 3 kind of safe areas to cross, would unite the two sides of campus much more. I agree that the BRT and lane reduction was a  good change, but more needs to be done in the future. Theoretically, the state can reach an agreement with the government to reroute U.S. highways, but there's a moratorium and they would likely have to repay some of the funding they got back in the 50s/60s. A re-route and closing is definitely possible, especially with the [recent construction of the opportunity corridor.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Opportunity+Corridor+Rd,+Cleveland,+OH/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8830fb76eb53b9d5:0x2eb93d1deffbc668?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjHiu_X5Yz3AhXkdc0KHUxhB88Q8gF6BAhYEAE)\n\nThe larger problem is that a reduction/closing of Euclid is a drop in the bucket of Cleveland infrastructure problems, with multiple freeways in I-490, 71, and 77 cutting downtown off, and I-90/shoreway cutting the city off from the lake. It's also a drop in the ocean of the changes that need to be made to U.S. infrastructure, but any progress is good progress.",

With the dental school tuition does have a lot to do with it though, since dental school at anywhere is so busy it's not like undergrad where you have time to enjoy this and that outside of school, there's really no use in considering much else besides money.

So a lot of students just apply to Case casually without having much research &amp; mental commitments done.\n\nCase is a great school. It is kind of hard to find another university with small student size + strong STEM school image among Case's range. Many \"haters\" take it for granted.",

The issue will always be that most students don't take full advantage of the resources of living in a city because they don't go beyond the radius of Cleveland Clinic or Dave's in Cleveland Heights.",

Honestly I think the food of Cleveland is pretty decent, though access can be a bit tricky without a car.",

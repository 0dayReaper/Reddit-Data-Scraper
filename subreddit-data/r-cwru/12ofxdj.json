            "comment": "It depends on your expectation. I expect to go to college to save money for my post-grad life and to focus on studying. Case meets my expectation and actually is a bit more than that :))\r  \n\r  \nCase food was bad in my year, I got in during Covid time, so the food was terrible cuz they were understaffed. But the past two years have been good in terms of the cafeteria. They have good and bad food days, but bad days are not even that bad in my opinion.\r  \n\r  \nCleveland has more than what people imagine about a city in Ohio. I and my friends made the best out of it. And mind you, we are international students from Asia, and we have been having a blast time here. It's nicer to have a car though, cuz it gets cold in October and does not warm up until mid-March. But even then the RTA is easy to navigate and the stations are very close to campus, or you can even say that they are actually on campus.\r  \n\r  \nIdk if you're POC, I'm Asian so I can only talk about Asian food. The Asia town in Cleveland is amazing, but ngl I know non-Asians love our food as well. Besides that some of my black friends and Hispanic friends also treat me out for dinners to eat their food and the food is amazing. I never have to complain about food here. There are some nice food places in the city, you just have to have some good friends to hang out with because the city is not safe to go out alone at night at all. The city is boring post 7PM too, I bring that up cuz cities in Asia never sleep LOL\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of social life, Case has A LOT OF clubs, and when I say A LOT, I mean A LOT. Whatever club you're thinking about right now, we all have them. If you're interested, you can take a look at https://community.case.edu/club\\_signup to see what clubs and organizations there are at Case. All kinds of clubs, and they are very diverse, plus Greek life is great, too. You can also find all kinds of fraternities and sororities at Case like at other colleges. If you're a woman like me, Case has a bunch of clubs for women in STEM and I join in all of them. I make great great friends who are also in my classes and they are the best.\r  \n\r  \nI personally am not a party person, but I do have a few friends who party every single week, so I join them whenever I feel like too, or else I just stay home and do my thing. Housing at Case is actually nice, unlike what other people say, you just gotta make the best out of it. If you're already a messy person, you make your room a mess, don't blame Case for that. Or if you get to third year and later, you can rent house off campus, they're usually at an affordable price compared to big cities like NYC you know, gotta find some cool friends to room with so you can save money and stuff.\r  \n\r  \nCase is diverse in terms of race too. People from all different backgrounds. My friends group has people from everywhere, literally. Europe, Asia, Africa, American friends, Hispanic. I heard that there is colorism and racism, but personally I have not met them yet.\r  \n\r  \nEven in terms of mental health support, Case is great at it. We have TimelyCare where you can meet with licensed therapists to talk to and it's totally free. It helps me a lot, as an international student, I'm unable to afford off-campus therapy. TimelyCare does its job for me. e hours, engage in class, be responsible, and get an A. It's just that. My friends on the premed track do all the things I listed above and got an A throughout his 4 years. I can say that all of my professors in the past 3 years are very understanding and caring. The courseload is hard but you got peer tutors, TAs, SI sessions, and study groups, to name a few. The navigators and the deans are extremely helpful.\r  \n\r  \nEven in terms of mental health support, Case is great at it. We have TimelyCare where you can meet with licensed therapists to talk to and it's totally free. It helps me a lot, as an international student, I'm unable to afford the off-campus therapy. TimelyCare does its job for me. I pray and pray to not get sick because IDK how the healthcare system works, but that's just me personally. You can go to the doctor and then buy meds later at CVS, I get the medicine for free because I have Aetna insurance.\r  \n\r  \nBut then again, it also depends on what your expectation of going to college is like. My comment is so long omg",

Libraries here are not as aesthetic as the libraries at the Ivy League, cuz I've been to some of them and I can tell. The [law library](https://case.edu/law/our-school/library) tend to be quiet and there are few people that go there (fewer than the main one). The main [Kelvin Smith Library](https://case.edu/library/) of the whole campus is crowded sometimes but cool for studying with all technologies you need. The [Cleveland Health Sciences Library](https://case.edu/chslibrary/) actually looks SO cool and it's my personal favorite. A hidden gem fr fr",

The buildings on the main quad also has A LOT OF public study area, you can literally grab any empty classroom and sit in there. Sometimes I just stay in the classroom even after the teachers leave just to enjoy the whole room to myself and no one would ever say anything lol\n\nBut for me I study better in a private environment then I think study rooms are better for me. I usually grab like a few close friends to study with or just study in the study room alone. I feel like being in the bedroom for too long makes me lazy as heck and being in the actual study room really forces me to get the work done.",

Food isn\u2019t the greatest but it\u2019s not complete trash. They have really good meals every now and then. Housing isn\u2019t bad either they\u2019re in the process of updating dorms/building new ones. My main downside is the school is getting a little crowded because they haven\u2019t built the infrastructure to keep up w the increase in students. Hope this helps!",

Our friends know how to mix it up, like anything that can get repetitive. \n\nGood school and vibe \u2014 read on here but also various other platforms.",

It's better to go to Dave's, Marc's, or Constantino's, and then cook for yourself. If you need help with recipes or want to have a friend to cook with, feel free to hit me up!",

I'm the one who got caught up with Cipher.  A group above nations... even the US. And I was the parasite below, feeding off Zero's power. They came after you in Cyprus... then Afghanistan... Cipher... just keeps growing. Swallowing everything in it's path. Getting bigger and bigger... Who knows how big now? Boss.

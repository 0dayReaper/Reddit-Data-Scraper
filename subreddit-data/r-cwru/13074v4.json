    "postText": "Hello Case Western Reddit!\n\nI'm an accepted CWRU Economics &amp; probably also Data Science student, and I'm interesting in going, although I'm still on the fence- but I'd like your input to break the tie! Cost isn't a significant factor to me due to financial aid, but right now I'm really curious about the job/internship opportunities for \"non-traditional\" business, as well as the respect for accommodations on campus.\n\nI'm not especially interested in accounting, finance, and the other \"gray business\" stuff like that, because they aren't that dynamic and I'd feel stifled. How much does Case/Weatherhead railroad you into that sort of thing, either through connections or classes?\n\nI am really into high-tech business products/consumer products like medical equipment or renewables, hospitality management/nonprofit management, and entertainment business. Are there many opportunities for this at Case, maybe through internships or company connections (Besides the obvious medical scene)?\n\nFor reference, I'm hoping to do consulting, general management, product management, internal finances, or maybe marketing, depending on the company!\n\nAs far as accommodations, how much leeway do teachers have over students? Do teachers respect learning accommodations, particularly in the Weatherhead school/GEs? Do students respect them?\n\nIf you all have any insight into the above for Case, please do let me know!",

            "comment": "I don't have any insight about Weatherhead, but the School of Engineering has a variety of specializations (biomedical, electrical, materials science, data). They're pretty open minded in terms of letting students explore their interests.\n\nI'm in the MEng program for Data Science, and I haven't had any complaints. Any projects I've been assigned involve students choosing how they want to pursue the assignment. I don't think you'll feel pressured to pursue anything outside of your interests at Case.",

They seem very receptive to students who have innovative and creative interests. If you have any questions about the DSci program, lmk. Always willing to help and answer questions.",

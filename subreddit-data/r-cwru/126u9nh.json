    "postText": "What are some good places near campus to get a decently priced haircut (preferably near Little Italy/Northside area, but I'd also be open to taking a longer walk or short bus or train ride if necessary)?  I have very thick, wavy/curly Indian hair so hopefully someone who knows how to deal with that, but if not it's whatever tbh lol.\n\nAlso considering dying my hair so any advice for places nearby where I could get both done (or DIY tips tbh lol) for that could be helpful\n\nEdited to add: I'm a woman btw",

Debbie at Hair in Motion down the street from that is also a good choice but I'm not sure if she's still around. \n\nCuts at both places were somewhere between $20-$30 at both places iirc, and they both do hair dyes as well.",

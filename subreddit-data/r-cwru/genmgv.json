I would concede it's not for everyone as it is an incredibly studious school with more of a focus on academics than socializing, but if that is what you're looking for it's perfect. People here are awesome, there's lots of diversity and everyone finds long-lasting friends. The area is great, lots of parks, green space, great food, some nightlife. The CWRU name is well respected and people are always impressed by it. Long story short, if you want a great education, a fantastic area, and cool (nerdy) people, CWRU is heaven. If you have any questions DM me!",

Probably not.\n\nDon't get me wrong, CWRU is a fantastic institution, but I'm not sure it was the right fit for me personally.\n\nI had always planned to enter industry after graduating. I was disappointed by how few of the engineering professors had meaningful industry experience. I believe the result was that professors were unable (or were otherwise unwilling) to tie abstract concepts back into the real world, and it hindered their ability to prepare me to apply what they taught in an industry setting. \n\nAdditionally, while the engineering professors at CWRU are highly skilled and accomplished researchers, I found that in general they were not skilled as educators. (I did not experience this issue when taking courses in other departments.)\n\nTalking with other students during my co-op and internships, some of them did not encounter these problems at their own colleges. I think I would have been better off at a college that focused more on preparing students for entering the workforce and less on research.",

Financial aid made it the cheapest option for me. The location is awesome. Cleveland has so much fun stuff to do: museums, restaurants, bars, parks, festivals, etc, etc. Everyone lives on campus for the first two years and for the next two nearly everyone lives on or within walking distance of campus. \n\nThe negative comes in the social side which is extremely important for me. On one hand, people are generally friendly and all live near each other. But the school is extremely studious. People tend to be pretty obsessed with academics to an unhealthy extent which also goes to breed a competitive culture that makes people feel like they need to take 20 credits a semester to catch up. I just personally wish there was a much more social campus culture. Partying, hanging out, or just overall more relaxed would be preferred. It exists to an extent, I just personally would have preferred more of a social school.\n\nUltimately, take my opinion with a grain of salt. Consider it in regards to your own personality and what you want from a school. CWRU is a perfect match for some people, and not so much for other people. To each their own. I still think the positives outweigh the negatives and that socially, you can find your fun if you look for it and don't let the CWRU culture bring you down.",

So if you feel they are a good fit for you and it comes out to be not too much more expensive than your in state school, then go for it. However, for professional schools, it is rare for somebody to get scholarships. In dentistry, where the name of your school doesn't matter for getting a job, I would have easily pick any school that's cheaper if I had the option.",

I ended up switching to majors in the humanities and social sciences (Classics and cogsci) and am much happier. I probably wouldn\u2019t have applied if I\u2019d known I was going to end up doing humanities, but I\u2019m so glad that I did end up going here. The smaller departments aren\u2019t as well known, but there are some really wonderful professors who deeply care about their students. Also, there are a lot of incredible students here! CWRU is not really a party school, and while there is some of that, if you want that experience from college it probably isn\u2019t a great fit for you. But, that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other social outlets. I\u2019ve made a lot of good friends here. It\u2019s true that some people hate on Case and complain about it. And maybe it was the wrong fit for those people. But to a certain extent, I think you can choose to be miserable at any college (obviously depression and other mental illnesses are a different thing and it\u2019s way more complicated than \u201cchoosing\u201d in those cases). If you want to have fun and learn a lot, there are plenty of opportunities to be happy and thrive at CWRU. \n\nAlso, if you like arts and culture, CWRU is right by the art museum and Cleveland Orchestra, and one of my favorite parts of going here has been getting to take advantage of living next door to some of the best art and music in the nation.",

I\u2019ve graduated in may of last year, but at the time I was at case, I absolutely loved the classics program. I don\u2019t 100% know about caliber, but if it\u2019s anything, I recently got accepted into classics phd programs at u of illinois and bryn mawr, and I am certainly not the first case classics major to go on to grad school in the field. I think the strength of program also comes down to what you\u2019re interested in, as well as what you\u2019re willing to put into it. It may not have as many professors in its department as some liberal arts schools or state universities with strong classics programs, but the faculty there were supportive and willing to help tailor the program to its students. If a student wanted to do the bare minimum for a major or minor in the department, I don\u2019t know how much they would get out of it. However, if they take initiative and participate outside of classes (eg attend talks through the Baker Nord Center for the Humanities, Cleveland Archeological Society, and department itself, utilize the museums and libraries, etc) I think it\u2019s a wonderful program.",

I went to an arts and humanities focused high school, and while I was interested in bio (specifically I wanted to be a researcher in genetics career-wise), I didn\u2019t have the same level of preparation (like advanced science and math courses) as some of the other students. I think it\u2019s absolutely doable to be a stem major at CWRU without an intense stem high school preparation, but it takes a lot of work, natural aptitude, or both. \n\nThe huge lecture sizes and number of people in the major were also a downside for me- it was really difficult for me to make connections with the professors, and I discovered that I learn better in smaller, more seminar-style settings which just aren\u2019t possible in intro-level bio courses at CWRU. All of this isn\u2019t to say that those connections with professors are impossible to make, and I had friends who connected and found mentorship within the department. After my first semester, I signed up for a few courses in other departments and found them more rewarding and conducive to my learning style. I\u2019m still glad that I started in bio, because I was able to knock out all of the stem breadth credits I needed for my eventual social science and humanities majors within my first year. Furthermore, coming to terms with the fact that I wasn\u2019t the person I imagined I\u2019d be when I was 16 and letting those expectations go in favor of pursuing new directions was an invaluable experience. \n\nI hope that helps answer your question!",

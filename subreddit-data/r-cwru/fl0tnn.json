Colleges, [including Ivy-League schools, ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/10/18/record-number-colleges-drop-satact-admissions-requirement-amid-growing-disenchantment-with-standardized-tests/)are dropping testing requirements. Schools who are test-optional include the University of Chicago, Wake Forest University and Emerson.\n\nI guess five years is a long time to be out of the world of American college admissions, but I imagine taking these tests are \"optional\" in the same way starting your own club and getting a ton of volunteer hours are \"optional.\"\n\nEdit: formatting",

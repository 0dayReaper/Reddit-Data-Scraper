    "postText": "I\u2019m an upcoming freshman and I\u2019ll be on the pre-dental track\u2014planning on minoring in Bioethics and Medical Humanities as well as either a BS or BA major in biology. \n\nI\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have too much on my plate if I decide to do a BS rather than a BA (difference of 9 credit hours). The only reason why I might be leaning toward a BS is that there is a research requirement (it\u2019ll give me space and the opportunity to more easily get involved in research, which I was planning on doing anyways). \n\nMy question is, does a BS in biology give you much of an edge when attempting to scope out lab positions as a freshman? I, personally, have already been working at a research facility in my hometown for the past 2 years (my names been on a medical symposium abstract and I\u2019m a coauthor for a published review paper). Will my experience be enough to help me get a research opportunity as opposed to majoring on the BS track?",

After all, you\u2019ll be a freshman just starting the degree. Research is super accessible at Case regardless of major even as a freshman. There are plenty of research positions to go around. Most people don\u2019t have prior research experience before getting to Case, so I wouldn\u2019t stress about not being able to find a lab.",

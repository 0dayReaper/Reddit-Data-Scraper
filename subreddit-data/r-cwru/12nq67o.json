I just committed to Case, and I\u2019m trying to look for a roommate as well as just generally get connected to others in my year :) I checked the co2027 Instagram and saw the thing abt the Patio app, but I can\u2019t seem to download it on my phone at all, and the link is invalid. Does anyone have any other resources or social media platforms that could help? Thanks so much!",

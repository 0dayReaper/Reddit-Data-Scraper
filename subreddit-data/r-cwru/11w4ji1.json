    "postText": "Heading to admitted students for these 3 schools and hoping that the visits will help our son guide his decision. UMD has great CS and impressive published research by the professors as seen on: https://csrankings.org/\nResearching outcomes, salaries in CS seems to be higher for RPI at $92K (UMD $76K, Case $69K). Can\u2019t help but wonder if RPI is ultimately a better ROI for education despite all the impressive research coming out of UMD. Hoping to learn more about all 3 CS programs. Definitely taking many other things into effect - travel costs and methods to home, rural vs city, safety, class size, research and internship opportunities. Appreciate any info in helping him make the best choice.",

I don\u2019t think you can go wrong among choices. \n\nSalaries are a function of what\u2019s reported, sample size, and which cities the alumni go to. I don\u2019t think you should read too much into that alone but it\u2019s a data point to consider. \n\nUMD is a great state school. Honestly, lightest on the wallet counts for something even as an out of stater.",

But I'll throw in my two cents.\n\nI'm a third year CS major at Case and I've really enjoyed my time here. Case is a very academically focused school, but the environment is very collaborative and not cut-throat at all which is nice. Case is also very flexible with majors. Once you're admitted, you can switch to pretty much any major you want (exception is Nursing). This flexibility also makes it easy to double major. Off the top of my head, I know people double majoring in CS + Math, CS + MechE, CS + Neuroscience, CS + Music, and CS + Theatre all in 4 years.\n\nAs for research, Case has tons of it. It's extremely easy to get involved in research here even as a freshman. I know someone who stayed on campus over the summer doing full time research and was able to get published at the beginning of their sophomore year. \n\nAlso not sure how you're finding the CS salaries, but Case has each graduating class take a survey and it includes info on their salaries after graduating (you can filter it by major): [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cwru.office.of.institutional.research/viz/CWRU\\_FDS2020\\_DRAFT/PrimaryPlans](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cwru.office.of.institutional.research/viz/CWRU_FDS2020_DRAFT/PrimaryPlans). 41% of CS graduates between 2016-2021 reported a salary of 100k+ upon graduation.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any other questions about CS here or Case in general!",

            "comment": "UMD is a way stronger place for CS research than the other two. So if research is your son's main goal, just go UMD. There are way more profs at UMD with constant output on a wider selection of subfields, and there are way more labs that figured out how to routinely run research projects with undergraduate students. Your son is also more likely to get rec letters from profs of bigger caliber, which is the key for things like phd applications down the road.\n\nJob hunting-wise, UMD is a better feeder school for big tech (especially Google); this is determined by location and alumni network. Though most entry-level hiring has school quota, so a bigger student body implies more competition. I don't think the salary outcome is a meaningful indicator, as it has a lot more to do with location than education quality.\n\nCase's advantage to UMD is it is smaller, where you'd have a smaller class size and better prof-student interaction \u2014 so your son will likely learn better on topics that are taught in both places. If he ends up doing research at Case, the prof-student connection will likely be stronger. Case and RPI are similar in sizes and atmosphere, but I'd say Case got the upper hand in location.\n\n(You can read more about my opinion on Case CS [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cwru/comments/11v505q/comment/jcykbjo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).)",

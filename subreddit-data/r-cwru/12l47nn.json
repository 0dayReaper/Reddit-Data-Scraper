I took a lot of sociology/gender/religious studies courses too. It was nice because Case is such a big STEM school that the class sizes were usually quite small which led to good class discussions and time with the prof if you needed/wanted it. I did not stay in academia so I can't really comment on job prospects/etc but I loved the vast majority of my professors and classes I took in the social sciences.",

Like the previous person said, class sizes are always a pretty good size and we typically engage in discussion and/or do group projects sometimes. I've loved almost every professor with the exception of one lol but they're all pretty cool and our assignments/topics are always interesting to me",

Whether it\u2019s enough, that\u2019s a different discussion and something you\u2019ll want to contact financial aid about. There are also scholarships on their website that you have to apply for so be sure to check those out.\n\nI chose Case because I liked how collaborative it is, compared to other schools I looked at. Everyone wants the best for each other, which is a nice environment to surround yourself with. Yes, classes are difficult, but there are lots of resources to help you. Personally, I really like SI (supplemental instruction) sessions, which are like review sections run by students that have already taken the course. \n\nIf you are absolutely certain about doing mechanical engineering, try to declare as soon as you can. The navigators, in the nicest way, are useless. I found that I got more valuable information from my meche advisor than the navigator but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a case of general knowledge vs specific. \n\nIf you stay on top of your work, you\u2019ll have plenty of free time. There are frats and sororities and with that comes parties, but people don\u2019t care if you\u2019re in them or not or if you go to parties or not. I started going my second semester and as a not party person I had a good time.",

Would that be a problem? I don't really express it much.",

            "comment": "Not really answering your question, but I would not suggest joining a frat merely to save money. If you want to join, join. If not, there are other cheap living options. Unless the rules changed, you can live off campus after your 2nd year. This comes with a different set of responsibilities than on-campus housing, but a lot of people do it successfully and it's one step closer to the \"real world.\"  \n  \nI figured myself for a 4-year frat house guy, but after 2 years it wasn't really my thing so I moved off campus with some friends. I was there for the summers so 12-month leases were no issue, and I had campus jobs to pay rent/utilities. I'm so glad I had the opportunity because I learned a lot from the experience and felt like I was a step ahead when I graduated.",

You can table that for after you graduate because for now, you can enjoy the luxury of living in a relatively safe/clean environment on a college campus. You'll be paying a premium for that added peace of mind, but it's worth it if it allows you to complete your coursework to the best of your ability.  \n  \nAnd don't talk to parents about off campus. They only know what they see on the news or horror stories people tell. Ask fellow students who are currently living and experiencing off campus life. Talk to the ones who didn't get \"shot after 4 minutes,\" that is, and see what they pay per month.",

Find affordable housing. \n\nThere is a FB thread about roommates and sublets for case. And thread posts about cheaper housing. And one coop I saw on past thread. \n\nGender fluid and transitioning is a potential problem if you join a frat assuming or requiring a specific gender. Do your homework.\n\nMore importantly just look for cheaper housing and lobby for off campus in year 2 (if possible). Or find year 2 housing and dial back your meal plan. Next year a second year dorm is opening that is apartment style but it might not match timing wise.\n\nGood luck.",

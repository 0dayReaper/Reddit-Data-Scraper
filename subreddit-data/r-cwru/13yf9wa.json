    "postText": "Is anyone who is taking principles of ecology (BIOL 351) in the fall willing to swap for intro to global health (ANTH 359)? The classes are at the same time. I am an evolutionary biology major and need to take ecology.\n\nIf anyone is also willing to swap ecology lab I am also enrolled in EEPS119 (geology lab) which is at the same time as ecology lab.",

    "postText": "Hello! Im looking to see the courses that I can take at case that would transfer to GT. And had a few questions abt case, hoping some students can answer for me. \n\n1. I applied as a marketing major and got accepted does that mean I have to take classes for the marketing program requirement or can I explore other major options? \n\n2. Can I solely just take general classes for the first year, or am I required to take the courses for the program.\n\n3. Is it a difficult process transferring credit from case to another college?",

            "comment": "Surprised you applied to Case without looking at the open admission policy. On the common app you are required to pick a major, however that section is completely meaningless.  When you get to Case, you don't have a major for the first year, and you can go into whatever you'd like afterwards",

You could switch to Engineering if you wanted to, but you need to have been prepared mathematically, to really be successful in that",

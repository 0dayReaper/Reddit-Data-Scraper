    "postText": "I was hoping to hear from current CWRU students about things they loved and hated about attending CWRU. Anything from academics to research/internships to quality of life is something I'd like to know about. I don't live in Cleveland so it'd be interesting to hear about how people from outside the city think of it. It should also be noted that I'm a spring semester admit so it'll be a bit different for me.",

            "comment": "Here's some rapid fire stuff:\n\n\\-workload is famously pretty heavy\\[edit: for STEM, mostly. you didn't specify if you're in STEM\\]. If you're smart with professors and ask around, though, you can make it a lot easier.\n\n\\-the neighborhood's pretty posh, but walk for 20 minutes in the wrong direction at night and you'll be in trouble.\n\n\\-lots of clubs, lots of opportunities for resume filler.\n\n\\-support from professors depends on your department. For my major, it's great.\n\n\\-little to no school spirit among students.\n\n\\-everyone makes jokes about hating the college, but deep down they all love it.\n\n\\-freshman housing is pretty dicey, but every college has pretty shitty freshman dorms. Here, the main problem is no AC and decaying furniture.\n\n\\-upperclassman dorms are good, though. Relatively low housing prices compared to other city colleges.\n\n\\-pretty high tuition, although at this point you probably know what you're getting into.\n\n\\-campus is kinda weird... it's split into a stem quad and humanities quad, and if you're big into one you'll spend most of your time on only half the campus.\n\n\\-weather's pretty nice(at least so far for me). Winters are getting milder, and summers are getting worse.\n\n\\-internship opportunities definitely depend on your field, but Cleveland definitely isn't barren for jobs.\n\n\\-I'm from the bay area and think that cleveland is a refreshing change of pace.\n\nFeel free to ask any follow-ups or any other questions.",

It's kind of difficult to keep one foot in both worlds... you're generally either a party animal or a nerd. \n\nThere's plenty of parties, but it's hard to find them if you're not well connected. The ones you do hear about are university affiliated, so there's no alcohol and they're pretty packed.\n\nPretty easy to find your people by just joining clubs, though.",

One final thing \u2014 Your spring admit cohort relations are more important for navigating school because you share the same issues \u2014 maintain a dialogue w other spring admits even from other years and compare your experiences with normal matriculation so you can understand when the school is trying to take advantage of you because it does happen.",

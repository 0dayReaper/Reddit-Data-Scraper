Everyone is busy so if you have a little ambition and are able to put in the time, others will generally be glad have you take a shot at a good lab position or let you take the reins of a small club. Bigger opportunities might take a little more legwork or credentials of course. But overall I think everyone wants students to succeed if they show some commitment.\n\nStaff are another story. Employees are very defensive of their roles (even if  meager) and IMO the only way to move up is to be next in line when someone retires or otherwise vacates their spot. It doesn't matter if you'd do a better job, politics and inertia are big barriers.",

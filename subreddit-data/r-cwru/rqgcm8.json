I\u2019d sure feel safer walking around seeing them.\n\nI get how Cleveland is a city and crime is to be expected, but I do think that CWRU has the means to drop the crime rate with some increased measures.\n\nSurely some of our collective $50K+/year can go towards protecting students against local crime. With all these COVID restrictions, which have gotten to the point where it\u2019s almost too restrictive, you would assume CWRU would make student safety a priority.",

A lot more than what is reported. And even outside of Little Italy, I know two people, living in houses on campus, that had their home burglarized in the last couple of weeks.",

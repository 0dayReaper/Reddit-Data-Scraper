    "postText": "I am an incoming graduate student and I was wondering if federal student loans for grad school were just like undergrad where they go to the school bill first and then you have to wait until the school processes it? Idk if this is a universal experience but at my undergrad school - loan \"refunds\" were usually not dispersed until late August due to how the school processed them. I was just wondering if anyone knows if it's the same for graduate school? And if so, when you usually get the loans? Hopefully this is cleae enough :)",

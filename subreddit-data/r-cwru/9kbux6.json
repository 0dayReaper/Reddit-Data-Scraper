    "postText": "On the roof of Glennan behind the HAM radio station there is a circuit breaker box. If you flip the fourth breaker from the right it disables the RFID scanner in room 102 in White. If you go in there, there is a pentagram on the floor. At each point there is a picture of a different Case Western faculty member. Going clockwise, the pictures are of Babs, Chris Butler, the new engineering dean, Drew Meyer and Covault.  Super strange!",

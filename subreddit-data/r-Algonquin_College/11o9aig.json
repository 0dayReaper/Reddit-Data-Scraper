I probably won't use the pass much and would rather save the money too but I also get why a school in a city with limited parking would want to encourage people not to bring their cars, so bleh\n\n\nEdit, added link",

Its mandatory. tally: who uses it all the time, sometimes, and never?\n\nI didn't need to go to the doctor last year. Can I opt out of paying the portion of my income taxes going towards the CHT?\n\nI don't drive. Can I opt out of paying taxes that go to road repair and highway maintenance?\n\nYou'll come to realize as you move into adulthood that part of being in democratic society that you pay into things that you don't necessarily use for the public good. The UPass is one of those things. It works like insurance. It's cheaper because everyone is paying for it, even though not everyone derives the same benefit. The program is not viable for OCTranspo if everyone is able to opt out. Your lower-income classmates would be disproportionately impacted negtiatively because they don't have access to a vehicle like you do, raising some pretty major equity concerns. As someone who worked two jobs and couldn't afford a car when I was in school (thus, relying heavily on public transit and the discounted uPass), I play the tiniest violin for upper-middle class suburban students who have the resources to be able to drive.\n\nI'd remind anyone that complains about the uPass that the numbers of people who use it is quite high in every Canadian jurisdiction that has one and that the Algonquin Student's Associations had a 83% approval mandate for it when it was passed.\n\nEven going beyond your colleagues at school, the UPass program is a form of stable, reliable income to OC Transpo that low-income citizens of Ottawa benefit from even if you don't.",

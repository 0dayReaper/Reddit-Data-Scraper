    "postText": "Hey! So I applied to the RT program for fall 2022 and was waitlisted. What has me so confused over the waitlist is the fact my HPAT score was a 1133/1200 which is a 94%, I originally thought I had a 1106. I email the program coordinator about this and she told me that the only thing that determines admission is the HPAT score. I have been talking with a few people who got admitted and they had lower HPAT scores than me. The only difference is that I wrote my HPAT with accommodations due to my permanent disability (would not interfere with my ability to do the program).  i'm asking for help, for those who got into the program if u can message me and tell me ur score, higher or lower so I can better understand what went wrong and be able to compare scores.  I would greatly appreciate it!!!",

I have 90s in my high school grades, I have a nuclear engineering degree with a minor in business, I got 95% on the HPAT, and I have been a volunteer firefighter for 3 years and have saved several lives doing CPR. I've been wait listed. What else am I supposed to do to get in?",

            "comment": "HPAT tests are not a combined mark. It\u2019s a rumour that goes around. You are tested in each section and those individual scores determine your admission into the program. \n\nEx. A friend of mine and I applied to PN at the same time. I did better in the sciences than her and I got an admission and she didn\u2019t. \n\nThere could also be some other things like if you applied too late, there may have been not enough seats in the program etc. \n\nA wait list isn\u2019t a denial, so I would email and find your seating position. If you\u2019re in the top 15 you are probably going to get a spot by the end of the first week, that\u2019s usually how many people drop out by then. My only advise is apply again, if you\u2019re passionate about this program keep going it in you get in!",

And it is a combined mark! If you talk to Admissions they will give u a combined mark out of 1200 and that is how u are scored and ranked for admissions.",

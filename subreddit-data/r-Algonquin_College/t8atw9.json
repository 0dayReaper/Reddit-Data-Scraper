    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI will be graduating from my University soon, but I was looking to going to college afterwards to receive some hands-on experience (and I'm not satisfied with career option my current degree provides).\n\nI was interested in the social worker program, as I always wanted to work in a job that help people.\n\nI just wanted to listen to the experience of those who have taken the social service worker program (either normal and intensive), and how fast were you able to find the job after graduation and what are the specific fields you guys work in. \n\nThank You!",

Your second year placement is the full 2 semesters and can be a great way to get your foot in the door at a job you want. I did my student placement with Roberts/Smart and I have been there ever since. I was hired on before I even graduated. Same with a few friends of mine in the program. They were hired on by their second year placements. If you have any other questions just ask. I had a good experience overall and I would recommend it.",

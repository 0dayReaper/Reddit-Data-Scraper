            "comment": "I graduated from this program back in 2014 when it was previously known as the Interactive Multimedia Developer program. It certainly has a mixture of both technical and artistic courses, which allows you to discover where your strengths and weaknesses lie.\n\nBecause the program is so diverse in what they teach you from graphic design to web development to video production, photography, and motion graphics, it will allow you to figure out what you enjoy doing the most and what you know that you'll never want to touch again. Maybe you do have a very artistic side where you will enjoy the design courses more than writing JavaScript and SQL, or maybe you will become fond of working with After Effects. I always felt that the main goal of the program was to allow you to figure out what you want to do in the media production world because there are so many different types of opportunities out there in this industry.\n\nI also wouldn't stress too much over trying to get the highest marks in every course in the program because unless you're a one-trick pony where you're an amazing designer, developer, and motion graphics artist (kudos to you if you are), you will likely get higher marks in the courses where that's just where your strengths lie compared to some of the other courses where it may not just be of any interest to you or it's just something that you may not be strong in. I discovered during the program that I am terrible at working with vector art, but then I also learned that I enjoy solving problems with code, so to each their own.\n\nI hope this helps!",

There is a 12-week internship in the last semester of the program, so there is always the opportunity of landing a full-time gig straight out of school. Also, be on the lookout for the summer client projects that the program offers which will give you real-world experience that you can add to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and portfolio (can't complain about getting paid to learn!)\n\nI can honestly say that the web developer courses (including the optional ones that you can choose to take in the second year) did help build a foundation for me. The teachers were amazing and went out of their way to make sure that you were successful by the time that you graduated. If you show that you're serious and eager to learn, the teachers will take notice and will help you succeed during and after the program.",

                    "comment": "Hi, u/michael_nugent! Is it suggested or necessary that one should have basic background/foundation in Java, CSS, HTML, coding, programming &amp; using Adobe softwares before enrolling into this program (Interactive Media Design)? Because I don't have any knowledge of those things at all (because my professional background is teaching). That's why I feel quite hesitant to take this program but willing to learn. Are the basics/fundamentals for example in navigating and using Adobe Photoshop taught first by the teacher? Or do the teacher directly provide activities to students having in mind that students already know how to use Adobe Photoshop? I could not explain or express my thoughts clearly, but I hope my questions make sense. Your reply is highly appreciated. Thank you and regards.",

Good luck let me know if you have more questions :)!",

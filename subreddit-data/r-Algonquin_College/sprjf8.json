    "postText": "I graduated from Algonquins electrical technician program back in 2016 and I have been in the Field as a tech ever since. After that much time , I came to the conclusion that being a tech isn\u2019t for me. I wanted to go back to study something different. However, I can\u2019t sacrifice my job for a full time on campus course and I down want something passed 2 years. I wanted to jump back into a different industry and found Business Analysis Studies. \n\nIf anyone took this course can you please let me know if it was good and worth it in the long run as a career. \n\nAny advice from previous techs in the same situation would also be appreciated.",

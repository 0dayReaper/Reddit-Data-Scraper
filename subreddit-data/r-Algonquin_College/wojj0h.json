Online isn\u2019t the best way but Ottawa is really far bcz I live in KWC region. Hoping to connect with folks taking the same program online/on-campus (hopefully someone who\u2019s also picking up a 2nd career like me would be nice)",

Makes a huge difference in staying healthy, sane and retaining information.",

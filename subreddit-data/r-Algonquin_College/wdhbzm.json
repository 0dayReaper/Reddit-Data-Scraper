Immigration and customs were cleared in Toronto, make sure you have your acceptance letter, proof of funds and tuition payment receipt along with your introduction letter! I was missing one of them, so it was a little troublesome, but you will get your study permit from the office who is checking your documents!",

I don't know that they would let you enter the country with no return ticket and no visa in hand. But I am no expert.\n\nBased on this looks like Vancouver: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare-arrival.html",

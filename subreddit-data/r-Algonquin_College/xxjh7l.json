It is easy to get behind or miss assignments/tests if you aren\u2019t prepared. I\u2019d spend about 3-4 hours a day on average doing my school work. I don\u2019t do any  school work evenings or weekends. I try to treat it like my \u201cfull time job\u201d but It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting in my computer everyday from 9-4. The teachers suggest spending 3 hours a week on average per course. I also work 1-2 days a week. All of the assignments and tests are due on a specific date by a certain time. The tests are not proctored.",

I also worked 2 days a week. I found working about 5 hours a day for 5 days generally. Then bigger assignments would take up more time or certain classes need more module and homework/ studing time.",

Computer skills will significantly reduce time spent on the course overall.\n\nTests are typically assigned an amount of days or weeks to complete, and you do it on your schedule. Same for exam - typically 2 days long, and sometimes with timeslots.\n\nThe key to an online course like this is to understand what you HAVE to do, and to focus on it",

I have made it 3 semesters in, but I find the work to be rather tedious and frustrating, which is not something I want to deal with daily for work life. I know not all jobs will always be \"exciting\" but holy shit is programming actually so boring.  \n\n\nHas anybody here quite the program before, deciding it wasn't for them? I feel like I have been at that point since semester 2, but of course everyone tells me \"stick with it\". Now I am in a field I feel like I am forced to enter.",

I know so many people who regret not completing their degree/diploma.\n\nAlso you don't ever have to work in field if you don't want to. Any education is good education and there is transferable skills in all programs.\n\nFinish the program, move on to something you enjoy.",

I quit because I found it difficult, but never boring. Granted, if you tried to learn from the college that might be the problem, the quality of the program is poor. I came in with years of experience, and I can only imagine how lost people feel who don't have that experience. The one thing I'll say is that you may find coding boring, but depending on the alternatives... it is certainly less boring and more rewarding then ending up in retail or something like it.",

You will not get hired just because you have a diploma, you need the skill set too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are all basic Java questions and if you can't answer them you should just leave (imo). It has been a waste of time and money. Cut your losses and do something else you actually enjoy doing.\n\nCan you explain objects and classes in Java? Can you write a for loop? Can you write if statements? Do you know the logical operands? Do you know the data types available in Java?  Can you tell me the difference between a reference type and primitive type? Can you tell me the purpose of the constructor? Can you tell me the difference between method overloading and overriding? Can you tell me the \"4 pillars of OOP\"? Do you know the difference between an abstract class and interface?",

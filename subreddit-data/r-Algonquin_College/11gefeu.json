    "postText": "Hi I just gave my HPAT today. I am applying for RPN program for Winter 2024. I rushed through the science part. At the end of the test they show scores For me it was 259 263 and 38. I did not do well on the science part. I am not sure if this 38 includes physics. Would anyone know if these are good score to get into RPN?",

If it\u2019s together, you will pass. If the science is scored individually then im not sure. I did mine yesterday and it takes about a week for the office to get back to you. Hoping you get accepted! Let me know.",

I know I had 42?/60 on the sciences! \n\nThe program is alright but mediocre at best. Most programs in Canada are unfortunately. Workload a lot but is manageable once you get into it, profs can be tough. It\u2019s a hard program to get used to the workload of at first. Lots of classes. First year is heavy on group projects too. Clinicals are typically unfair, and generated by an AI system. They say it\u2019s \u201cbased off of your ranked list\u201d but most of the time randomly assigned. All first year is LTC, LTC rehab or geriatrics. Limited access to peds placements, only available in level 3 or 4, around 8-10students get placed in it only. Lots of communication issues with profs, staff and often things change last second. But at the end of the day, nursing is a good field, it\u2019s a tough field but it\u2019s great to work in. Getting through 2 years sets you up for a career so regardless of the school you attend, you just need to get through the 2 years! \n\nBest of luck!

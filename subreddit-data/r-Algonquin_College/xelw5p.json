    "postText": "Has anyone on here taken the online Bookkeeping course ACC2207? I just started it a few days ago and have some questions.\n\n1. Where should I start? Do I go with the study plan recommendations or the weekly quiz or both? If I should start with the study plan recommendations, should I work through all the recommended sections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. In the study plan recommendations, there are two commands. One is to practice and the other is to be quizzed. What's the difference between the two since they're both practice materials?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. When doing the practice quizzes, do I have multiple attempts at them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Do you have any advice on how to navigate through Pearson as it can be a bit difficult to navigate sometimes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried asking my teacher these question and she sent me an orientation email she's going to send out to everyone tomorrow. The email didn't answer any of my questions. She's also planning on doing a Zoom session, but it's next Thursday. Most online courses have their Zoom orientations a day or two after the course starts, not 9 days after the course begins. After that orientation session students who aren't working ahead like myself will have 4 days including a weekend to navigate through a confusing and arguably ass backwards site (Pearson), do practice materials and then do their first major assignment. Fuck me!",

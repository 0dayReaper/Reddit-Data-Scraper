You have 4 or 5 days a week of classes, depending on when your lab nights are, and I think it also depends on if you are able to get exemptions or not. \n\nClinical is full time placement. There is one month of clinical in the first year, then you go to clinical again starting in the second half of the second year. There is summer break in year 1, but there is no summer break in year 2. The year 2 clinical goes straight through the summer with only 1 month off in spring (when the first years come). Year 3 is all clinical.",

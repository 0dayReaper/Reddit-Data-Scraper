    "postText": "Hi everyone! So I'm an international student and I  just received an offer letter for the **Business Development and Sales** Sept 2023 intake, but I'll be deferring for the Jan 2024 intake. I'm currently in the process of choosing which schools to apply to.\n\nI have a question for alumni or students currently taking the program:\n\n* How is the program? Like the professors, classes, and the activities/assignements?\n* It was mentioned in the my LOA there is a work placement. How is your experience with this?\n* Is the program worth it in terms of the learnings and skills to equip you post-grad?\n\nI'll appreciate any response to the questions, thank you in advance.",

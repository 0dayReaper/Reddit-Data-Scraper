You\u2019ll be grinding constantly to build your business, especially with how saturated the market is for this industry. \n\nPlan on just getting employed by existing businesses? It really depends, smaller businesses don\u2019t have the funds or ability to hire full-time trainers/employees. So you\u2019ll find yourself with multiple jobs all over the city. If you plan on getting in to one of the bigger box gyms, then you\u2019ll have a better work/life balance but you won\u2019t be compensated for any above and beyond efforts. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough industry, but if you\u2019re passionate and dedicated; it will be lucrative.",

I have a degree in an unrelated field. The degree will get me a comfortable living, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s exactly what I want, ya know?",

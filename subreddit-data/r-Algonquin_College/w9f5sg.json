    "postText": "Hi, I will be a student of Biotechnology this September. From now on there has one month left. So I'd like to read some textbooks on Biotechnology. Could any Biotechnology student tell me any relevant book name for semester one? So I can borrow it or pay it to read in advance. Thanks!",

For biotechnology I think these are what you would need \n\nBIO1300(Cellular Biology): \n\nTextbook:Essential Biology with Physiology, 6th edition, Pearson\n\nOnline resource(s): Mastering Biology, www.masterbiology.com\n\nBTC1300(Biosafety):Mentions nothing besides online resources which would be provided by your professor\n\nBTC1305(Understanding Biotechnology): According to the syllabus for this course, it says to \u201cConsult with the professor prior to textbook purchase.\u201d\n\nCHE1302(General Chemistry): Syllabus states to \u201cCheck with your instructors before purchasing the textbook\u201d, however there are many resources online for general chemistry.\n\nSCI1000(Essential Laboratory Skills) there is no textbook but rather online video content and professor demonstrations \n\n\nI left out the lab components(BIO1301 and CHE1303) as they are labs that tie in with Cellular Biology(BIO1300) and General Chemistry(CHE1302).\n\nIf it\u2019s also relevant, I\u2019m entering the first semester of biotechnology in the fall",

But I do know that some of the assisting courses like dental anatomy (DEN4300) and dental radiography (DEN4453) are the same for both programs. \n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure, but I know some people in my class had taken the assisting program before doing hygiene and they were exempt from certain classes in semester 1. Your best bet would be to contact Angela Nuelle. She is the program coordinator and could probably tell you!",

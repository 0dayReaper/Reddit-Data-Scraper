    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI am interested in the echo program at Algonquin.  I previously did the cardiovascular technology program. But my grade for one cardiac anatomy course were just slightly below 70%. But most all my other grades are above 85%.\n\nIs there a way I can retake that one course before I apply for the echo program?\n\n I'm kinda worried I might not get in since the Echo programs requires two anatomy courses above 70%.\nI'll do whatever it takes.\n\nThanks for your help!",

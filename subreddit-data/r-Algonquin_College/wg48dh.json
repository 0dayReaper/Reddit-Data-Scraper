Curious what people think about this\u2026are there usually some books in those bundles that aren\u2019t actually required? Would you shop around secondhand for them instead?",

            "comment": "You need pretty much every textbook that is put as \"required\" in the DMS program, because even after you're done with the program you have to study for the Sonography Canada exams. Also, most people in DMS don't sell their textbooks because it's also a valuable tool you can use once you start working. With that said, can you make do with only some of the textbooks? Probably, (for example, Hagan-Ansert includes some OBGYN info that overlaps with the Kupinski OBGYN textbooks) but most people just buy every textbook. The Frank Netter anatomy textbook you may reference but it's not really necessary, it's just a nice textbook to have. You can find the PDF version of a couple required textbooks online I believe. You may also choose not to use the accompanying Hagan-Ansert workbook that goes with the textbook if you don't think you'll use it. It really is a case-by-base basis because it's not just about passing Algonquin College exams, it's also about preparing to be a competent sonographer and passing the credentialing exams. Get whatever you think will help you achieve that. Teachers will most likely tell you to buy all the required textbooks.",

The course load is heavy but not necessarily difficult depending on who you ask \n\nI was also nervous that the program would be too hard before I enrolled. Now that I\u2019m in it I am kind of tired but I wonder why I was so anxious about it being difficult. One step at a time I guess :)",

Each student selects their top 3 (it\u2019s 3 for me might be more for you) and they get matched accordingly\n\nLevel 1 and 2 placements for me were long term care and then rehab at the general hospital- it was 2 days a week :p \n\nIt will be explained in orientation but no you don\u2019t need to worry about getting your own placements. There is a PARAMED pass you need to get placement approved though. Look into the level 1 and 2 paramed placement pass requirements since many people need to get up to date on vaccines / get police checks/ CPR training\n\nAdded : feel free to PM me if you have any questions regarding the PN program - I also did the PSW program and I\u2019m working with an agency as a PSW at TOHs on the weekends/ time off",

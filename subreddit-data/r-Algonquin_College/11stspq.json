Furthermore, it seems that the government has overlooked the needs of students, and is instead focusing its efforts on receiving refugees and foreign workers. I personally completed a two-year (co-op) program in IT, yet I found myself working in construction, retail, and McDonald's. My experience illustrates that students do not appear to be a priority.  \nIt is important to recognize the valuable contributions that international students make to the Canadian economy and society. These students bring diversity, innovation, and skills that are essential for Canada's growth and prosperity. Therefore, it is crucial for the government and employers to support and invest in international students' success.  \n\n\nI hope it helps...",

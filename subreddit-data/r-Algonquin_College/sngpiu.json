    "postText": "Hi! I am in level 2 of Computer Programming at Algonquin College and I was pulled from the co-op stream because I received a low mark in one of my classes which I am currently retaking. I\u2019m worried about landing a job when I complete the program without the co-op experience. Can anyone tell me if it is worth continuing and what the job prospects look like for grads without that work experience? I appreciate all your help. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Having a co-op is certainly a help but not a requirement. I would not base my decision to continue or leave the program only on the fact that you will do a co-op or not but if you like and enjoy the program itself and you see yourself working in this field. You can do projects, contribute to open-source, volunteer, create a project for yourself or your family, freelancing, engage in the community and do networking and this will all help you get a job.\nThere are many people doing the program without co-op right? There are also the people that are part-time (myself included), online, etc. Getting a job will mostly depend on yourself and your skills and while co-op is a big help, it is not the only thing that helps.\nIf you have the skills and good attitude someone will give you that first opportunity and then the rest will be history. After a few years, the co-op you did won't even matter. Remember that many companies put a big focus on the person and the soft skills.",

Businesses get pretty big tax break for taking on co-ops.\n\nIf it was me I'd graduate computer programming and then do one of the one year programs that have co-op like cyber security.",

The monotony of scanning the same body part over and over doesn\u2019t bother me at all. It\u2019s also a slightly shorter program which is another plus. \n\n If the idea of more invasive procedures doesn\u2019t bother you, general sonographers can do a lot more than cardiovascular sonographers. They\u2019re the ones scanning babies and basically everything other than the heart and blood vessels. Because of a wider range of roles, there seems to be a lot more jobs for general sonographers than cardiovascular sonographers as well.\n\nEither way, you\u2019re heading into a great program that will set you up with a rewarding career in healthcare! Good luck with whatever you choose to do :)",

            "comment": "I'm currently in the DMS program. I also was accepted into both but I chose general over cardiac. I didn't really want to scan the same thing forever, and I've heard from my instructors now that it's easier to start with general and then specialize in cardiac later if you want (that's what a couple of them have done). \n\nCardiac has fewer classes and less lab time during the week. In DMS in school labs, we scan abdomen, female pelvis, thyroid, carotids, and lower extremity veins as the main assessments, with other activities thrown in. In clinical, OB and scrotum are added in to the competencies on top of the above-mentioned exams.\n\nBoth programs are good choices, I think it depends a lot on personal preference. If you have any specific questions about DMS, let me know!",

You can even look at youtube videos of people scanning in each field to get a feel for what scanning will be like. I can't speak for the cardiac instructors but the DMS instructors are all so amazing. They really know their stuff and only wish to see you succeed. But you have to be ready to go into the lab 4-5 times a week on top of all the studying you will be doing. It's a lot of work but it's completely worth it. It completely depends on what you want to do, but personally I'm a big advocate for DMS.",

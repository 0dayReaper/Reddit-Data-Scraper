            "comment": "Here are my tips\n\n   1. Before the start of your semester around 2-3 weeks, send email to your \"important courses\" professor, ask them to describe briefly what you're going to learn in that semester, and start learning them on youtube, Linkedin learning,... You'll get ahead between the rest for a bit, but it's extremely important.\n\n   2. In the first week of school, you won't learn anything because the professors just gonna talk about the course, the grading system, the assignments,... and all of them will include in the \"CSI\", which you can find on Brightspace in that week too. Then, make a semester plan for all the courses in 1 table based on those \"CSI\" . Such as week 1 , you gonna have quiz 1 and assignment 1 due for Course 1 or sth... \n\n\nAnd then every week, on Sunday which I usually do, visit the semester plan you made, go to the following week's section and look for what you have to finish in that following week, then transfer them into Google Calendar or any calendar you use, like Assignment 1 of Course 1 \u00ed due on Tuesday, Quiz 1 of course 2 is due on Friday... And then base on the week schedule you've made on the calendar, break down everyday's plan. Such as what you need to do on Monday or Tuesday, what you need to finish on Wednesday... This is super important in college based on what I've been through.\n\n   3. My third tip is to TAKE NOTE the lecture. What I usually do is, for example I'm in week 2 and I have a class of Computer Essentials on that day, I'm gonna review my week 1 note, then I take note the week 2 lecture slide, then I go to class to listen and understand more. Then on week 3 I'm gonna review my week 2 note, take note week 3 lecture slide and go to class and then over and over again. So that'll be 3 times you'll read the note and you'll understand or remember those more than those who don't take note. And remember to do it weekly. If you procrastinate and skip this routine 1 week,  you know the \"Domino effect\" right? 90% you won't be able to catch up with the pace you used to have and then things will be worse.\n\nThose are the tips base in my personal experience, you can also learn more general tips for college on Youtube too.",

Set reminders and do not procrastinate. Take a day break from anything school/work related every week to avoid burning out. Friends will come naturally jus talk to someone and before you know it you\u2019re buddies.",

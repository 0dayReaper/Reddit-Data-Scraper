    "postText": "Hi everyone, just wanted to get some insight into the competitiveness of the MRT/RT at Algonquin and how well I would generally need to perform on the AC-HPAT? I'm in my final year at Western for Kinesiology and I am holding a mid 80's average (83-86) and I also had a 90% average in high school for all university level courses. I've been out of high school in nearly 5 years now and my knowledge of high school level bio and chem are rocky so I'm feeling not too confident for the HPAT. Could someone let me know if my HPAT scores are going dramatically impact my chances of admission given what I've accomplished academically up until now?",

I was told that about 900 people apply for the MRT program each year, but there are only about 50 seats available in the program. \n\nHave you done the HPAT yet? There is a date you need to complete it by for equal consideration. If you don\u2019t complete it by then you will be considered after the 100s of others who had completed it in time.\n\n\nIt was years ago, but I got perfect on the math section, and got 90% and 95% on either science and reading comprehension. I forget which of those 2 scores went to which of those 2 sections. Back then there was also a 1 hour timed written essay. I think that this was removed from the HPAT, and good thing that it was as it was marked by a robot and some prompts were hard. I got 6/8 or 75% on it. \n\n\nI got accepted to the RT program immediately, but was waitlisted (#7) for the MRT program. I got in to the MRT program thanks to an agreement with another program that I had completed.",

I have been taking Chem and Phys prep courses for the last 5 months to update my high school grades ( I was at mid 70's in both and was afraid it wasnt good enough). I also don't want to forget any material that is important, as I learned some new concepts I was not exposed to back in high school . I got 268 in reading, 261 in arithmetic and 51/60 in the science portion. I was waitlisted for a few weeks and just got my acceptance a few days ago!\n\nI hope this helped you a bit. Message me if you have any questions! &lt;3",

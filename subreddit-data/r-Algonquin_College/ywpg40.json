    "postText": "Hi, I'm in 12th grade and I'm considering studying advanced diploma in biotech at Algonquin. Are there many jobs available with a diploma? \n\nI read that it would be more competitive to find a job with a diploma. In that case, if I continued with the 3rd year of the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science degree program at Royal Roads University, would there be more chances of me getting a job afterwards?  \n\nThank you in advance.",

            "comment": "Honestly, very little and what there is, is incredibly low pay. \n\nThe jobs are few and far between. Any position of note that I interviewed for had other applicants with masters or PhDs. \n\nI graduated from the program many years ago and everyone I know who cared about making more than 45k a year abandoned the industry. You will be at most, a lab tech making just above minimum wage. \n\nI did work some incredibly interesting and specialized jobs, but after years in the industry jumping around, turns out I have better pay, benefits and work/life balance working in an unrelated government job.",

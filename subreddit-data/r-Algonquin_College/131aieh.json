    "postText": "I started a college program in September of 2021. Class of April 2023. My semester ended yesterday. My program coordinator hasn\u2019t found me a placement for over a year. I\u2019m one of maybe 8 people in my program who didn\u2019t have a placement at all. I was supposed to start a placement in January 2023, for 11-13 weeks. I just got an email today, April 27, that they found me a placement virtually and I will need to work there for 6 weeks to graduate. The semester ended yesterday. I did virtual modules to get 100 hours towards my placement hours, and I\u2019m 20 weeks pregnant now and disabled. I also don\u2019t have stable internet to do a virtual placement. My OSAP funds ran out beginning of April. Can they force you to do this after the semester is already over? \nWhat do I do? I can\u2019t come back next January as I will have a newborn and have no childcare.",

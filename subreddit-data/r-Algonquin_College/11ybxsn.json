    "postText": "Hi everyone, im going to move to Ottawa this Sep for a Nursing program at Algonquin College. I am currently living in BC so im looking for places to rent online. I will move out in June and go back to my country for a summer vacation, then come back in Ottawa in Sep. I have some questions about this.\n    1) Can I just move all my stuffs in Ottawa first and move in later in Sep, bcs i dont want to bring everything back to my country and then bring them back here again:(\n    2) My budget is &lt;900/month, i am very open to share with another student.  Where should I look for rent and when should I start looking for it?\nThank you!!",

It will be cheaper than renting a place now until then if you don't plan to live there for now. \n\nAs for places to live, look around college square and up baseline towards Greenbank, Pinecrest, Lincoln Fields area, and Westboro. \n\nGood luck",

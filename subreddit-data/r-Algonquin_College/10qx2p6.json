I heard that we can use calculator for some of the questions so should I bring my calculator with me? Also..\nHow long is the test\nHow many questions \nDo they provide you with at least the molar mass?\nAnything I should look out for?",

The test is 3 hours, however you can book another session if you run out of time I finished mine in 2ish hours. There\u2019s 80 questions (20 reading, 20 math and 60 science). They do provide you with molar mass, just take your time with everything and don\u2019t rush! You\u2019ve prepared yourself as much as you can so just try your best. Good luck!!!",

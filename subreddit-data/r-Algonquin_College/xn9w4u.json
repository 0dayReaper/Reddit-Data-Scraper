This happens to all my devices. \n\nI cant even email my professors since I was logged out of my outlook and I need to log in again but my pw still won\u2019t work. \n\nPlease tell me im not the only one. I literally have an assignment due tonight and I need to upload it. Ugh. \n\nThanks",

Some of my friends who use brightspace have no trouble logging in though so it still kinda pisses me off why I cant. \nBut thanks again i thought my keyboards were going rogue on me \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

This is why you also can\u2019t access your email, email also uses your network credentials.",

How about other courses? How's the workload in general? Lots of group projects? Any advice?\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "welp in your last semester 2 courses are completely work on your own and don't have a class time ( 1 is building a software for a client and the other is to learn and new programming language of your choice) the gen ed elective classes are 100% free marks. Alot more group work involved this semester 3/5 of your classes will have a group component for at least 10% while other classes the entire class is group work so choose teammates wisely. Workload is pretty heavy but it is level 4 so it's kind of expected",

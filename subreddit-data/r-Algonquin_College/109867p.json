    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI'm looking for anyone currently enrolled in the Computer Programming program at AC either in year 1 or in year 2 that can post a screenshot of their current schedule.\n\nI'm enrolled for May 2023, but want to get an idea of how course scheduling ends up happening, as I have a flexible job that allows me to work half days/full day on a day's notice. I literally cannot afford to pay my rent and bills if I do not work at least a little bit during my full-time studies at AC, so I want to see if this is viable or if I should expect to basically end up homeless.\n\nYou can either DM me with a screenshot of your schedule or just post it up to imgur and share it here.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I actually wanted to get into CP but it was full. CET-CS seems to focus more on the engineering side while CP is more business oriented. For example CP does more with databases but CET-CS learns more languages.",

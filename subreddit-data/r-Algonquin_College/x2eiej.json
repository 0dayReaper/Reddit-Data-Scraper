You are allowed in those classes. \n\nWe have silent study areas in E building in the second floor beside the spiritual space. Keep in mind you will not be able to talk in those areas. \n\nI also would recommend the library because there are different levels of volume in the library. \n\nPlease please please mute when you are not taking and please communicate and participate in your classes!!",

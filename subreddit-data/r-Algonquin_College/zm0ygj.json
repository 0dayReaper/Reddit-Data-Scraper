    "postText": "Hey all, \n\nLooking for some advice. I'm trying to pivot out of my current career into tech, and was interested in both of these programs.\n\nI'm leaning a bit towards the MADA program as it seems like it would be a bit more focused and lower barrier to entry than learning Java/C+ or more computer-science type stuff. (I did a bit of self-learning with front-end web dev (The Odin Project)).\n\nHowever, most of my friends in tech or software eng have all told me that to pass interviews, I need to learn data structures and algorithms, which it doesn't seem like would be taught in much depth at all in the MADA program. \n\nIt looks like MADA could potentially get my foot in the door with a tech job in the most direct and potentially less painful route, but I'm concerned that it will also limit my options in terms of potential pathways to go as it seems like the breadth of Computer Programming would lay down a better overall foundation for career options.\n\nAny and all input about your experiences with the programs, experiences as a software engineer, etc. are welcome. Thank you!",

In my experience MAD&amp;D teaches very little theory, but that might not be super important for a lot of front end jobs.",

            "comment": "It depends what you want from the program. If you are good at learning languages on your own and want to get an easy foot in the door the MADD might be better. Personally I don't feel I'd learn hard languages like C++ on my own, and would rather a longer program with a better foundation, For that reason I chose CET. It seems that MADD also gives you a better foundation for creating your own application, learning mobile industry trends, so if you are looking to start a business or app from those skills I'd chose MADD.\n\nI think CP and CET will give you the best start to apply for a verity of jobs. MADD seems it will give you the best start to make your own app or be a contractor to make apps for companies.",

Ask someone who is hiring for the job you want which credential they'd prefer.",

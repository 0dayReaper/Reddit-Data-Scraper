International students are men and women that are already here! looking for an opportunity, educating themselves to contribute to their communities and this country, but they are not supported by the government.\n\nWhy Canada doesn't help the ones that pay 3 or 4 times the tuition fees in education institutions, pay rent, pay bills, gas, Hydro, and TAXES ??",

I am asking for the millions of international students around Canada who have invested all their savings and struggle for themselves and their families, to find no response from the government with a migration program that was said to be constant and it has been 3 years since its first and last application. So I invite you to be more receptive and go out and look at the world from the eyes of the thousands of migrant students.",

That\u2019s very interesting.\n\nWould you agree that every other group that comes here and doesn\u2019t like it should also not stay? Namely, groups who come here and change the \u201cCanadian ways\u201d to their own? Like Latinos with their dancing music, Chinese with their holidays, Indians with their festivals?\nWould you agree that the governments need take a similar approach? And then leave the Canadian workforce at a dead spot?\n\nJust fyi, the Canadian government offers a monthly allowance plus food and accommodation to immigrants from certain countries, who don\u2019t even have to look for a job because they get around 1k and don\u2019t have to worry about rent or food or even buss pass. Obviously they bring nothing to the table. Conversely, you have immigrants to come here to study SO THAT they can get a job and HELP INDUSTRIES in this country. They, and OP I think, are not asking really to become citizens, but at least not to pay 40k for a 2 year full time program that must be full time because otherwise you don\u2019t qualify as an international student, and you need 3 jobs to afford this tuition but don\u2019t have time because the program must be full time, and if you change to part time, you will lose your student permit and not be able to apply for the residence/citizenship later on. All of that so you get the crappy teachers (at least in my program).",

I just think its ridiculous when people come to a country and feel entitled to everything like I met an immigrant who was complaining that immigrants dont get the good jobs (which is true) but she was referring to not getting her own promotion.. well shes already earning 90k.. she was bitchinf about not getting a promotion to a 200k position and shes only been here 4 years. Meanwhile the streets are packed full of homeless citizens who have been abandoned  \n\nI have gotten death threats from immigrants before because I slept with a hijabi without being muslim or married and I thought that was funny and pretty un canadian behavior though but thats never stopped me",

Thats not how I see it. Canadian culture is kind of syncretic and everyone is usually a blend of their ancestral culture and canadian values. Canada actually absorbs immigrants way better than most countries despite preaching a culural mosaic",

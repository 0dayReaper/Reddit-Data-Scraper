I wanted to ask are there any pieces of software I should have on hand coming in to the program? E.g. a specific VM platform to get comfortable with, or a specific code editor?",

The server has links to a lot of useful websites, PDFs and video that others found helpful when completing this program. It also full of past and present students in the program and some of the program professors and the current coordinator of the program can also be found there too. \n\nIf you like to join, send me a private message and I will provide the link to the server. \n\nThanks \nLargeSmiles",

The networking course is a little hard to prep for as the program uses Cisco switches with their proprietary OS.",

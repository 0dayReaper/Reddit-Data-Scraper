Outside of that there are a bunch of different events happening throughout the day, you can check out the [AC Day 1 website](https://www.algonquincollege.com/orientation/) for further info and you'll find what you need). It's a great day to meet classmates and get familiar with campus. Lots of people around to help you answer any questions you might have!",

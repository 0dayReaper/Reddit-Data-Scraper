This is a problem as I can't access my email or platform to access my courses. Any suggestions? Or is anyone having a similar issue?\n\nAny help would be great!",

It\u2019s the same case for me the last time I checked, but I was only just recently accepted so the circumstances surrounding your userID might be different from mine.",

            "comment": "Hello, I am currently a 1st year practical nursing student at the Perth Algonquin College campus and would be happy to answer any questions you may have.  \n\nThe Perth campus is MUCH smaller than the Ottawa or Pembroke locations, but that has a huge benefit in that class sizes for lectures are approximately 24 students total and for lab classes they are limited to 12 students -they split us into 2 sections.  \n\nThis is honestly a huge plus (smaller campus/class sizes)-having been to the Ottawa campus some lectures could have upward of 120+ students and it can feel very overwhelming/easy to get lost in the crowd.  \n\nThe college staff are supremely supportive of students and bend over backwards to help those who need it.  I have yet to have a negative experience with faculty, any concerns are addressed promptly without delay.\n\nThe advice I would give to an aspiring future Perth Algonquin nursing student is to start you immunizations/vaccine paperwork for placement minimum 3-4 months before the program starts in January, as all vaccine/immunization paperwork needs to be done before placement (deadline approx Jan 30th).  For some of the immunizations it can take up to 3 months from start to finish as there needs to be a certain amount of time between shots/some are not compatible or will throw off blood screening results.\n\nThe good news is that the onsite nurse at algonquin is able to fill out your paperwork/give immunization shots which makes the process easier to navigate (as an international student there may be a cost for immunization shots, but they will fill out the paperwork for free).  \n\nAlso need a police check to enable you to work with vulnerable populations (elderly).\n\nFor the town of Perth there is no bus system or trains, but the college does offer a shuttle bus that picks up students and takes them to their respective placement (perth/Carleton place/almonte).  Rent is expensive in Perth, but thats true of most places in Ontario Canada :P\n\nThe program itself is very challenging, there are assignments/quiz's/readings and lab's weekly with several large tests/exams per course each semester.  But so long as you show up to class/do the work assigned and treat it like a job-you will succeed.  \n\nIf there is anything I didnt cover or that you would like more information on please let me know, I honestly love this course and dont regret attending algonquin Perth campus one bit.",

Until then these are just days off.\n\nWednesday - Nursing lab (either 9am-11am or 11am-1pm), Health-Care consumer lecture 2pm-4pm\n\nThursday - 11am-2pm Nursing theory lecture, 3pm-6pm Intro to Psychology lecture\n\nFriday - 9am-11am Communications lecture, 11:30am-2:30pm Anatomy &amp; Physiology lecture, 3pm-4pm Nursing theory lecture.  \n\nFor Friday they have all lectures online through zoom.\n\nMake sure to start you placement paperwork early, it will take some time to get everything in order!  It can take almost 3 months from start to finish.",

What are the typical hours for placement?  Is it normally a morning shift or afternoon/evening?\n\nFor the second placement, is it in labor and delivery or various units in the hospital?  I have looked at previous course outlines and figured the second placement was in L&amp;D and the third in med/surg. Thanks",

                    "comment": "7am - 3pm for my placement and I think thats fairly standard, your 1st/2nd placement will be at a retirement residence working with the elderly practicing your basic care skills.  \n\nPerforming psw duties 1st semester with some basic assessment/care plan, 2nd semester you continue psw duties but also incorporate assessment/documentation/more extensive plans of care and more the \"paperwork\" side of nursing.\n\n3rd/4th semester you will complete placement in a hospital setting to practice your developing skills.  \n\nAnd for your consolidation you get to choose your final placement - the other 4 are preselected (2 @ retirement residence/2 @ hospital).  Ideally you would target your consolidation at the place you hope to gain employment post graduation-but that is just my personal opinion.\n\nYou are able to specify the preferred location for placement -1st/2nd semester choices were perth/carleton place and almonte I believe.  I imagine that 3rd/4th semester will be similar -perth hospital/smiths falls hospital/Carleton place hospital etc.\n\nIf you want to reach out to the program coordinator here is her contact info:\n\nhttps://www.algonquincollege.com/perth/contact-card/stephanie-lee/\n\nBest of luck on your educational journey my friend!",

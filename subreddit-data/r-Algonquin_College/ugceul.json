    "postText": "Hi! \n\nDoes anybody know how many hours are required for placement 2 of the ECE program? I am currently working full time as director approved rece in a daycare and have many years of experience in childcare, so I was able to PLAR placement 1 but am wondering how many hours I need to complete in placement 2 (and 3, if you know). Also, are placement officers generally lenient about doing placement where you work, or at a different location of the same company, or should I just avoid telling them where I work? I absolutely cannot afford to stop working during placement and my centre is far too short staffed to manage without me for the duration, but my supervisor is on board for putting me in a different room for specific hours or swapping me with staff from another location for the duration of my placement. \n\nThanks!",

I'm kinda in the same boat...employed in the field, can't afford to take time off for full-time placements (single mom to two teens), but wanting to get my diploma.  I've mulled it over and over...the only thing stopping me is those darn placements.",

                    "comment": "Hey! This may be an old post but it\u2019s actually still pretty relevant for me as I only just completed my program in December 2022. I spoke to Algonquin and they weren\u2019t willing to budge on anything - they said I had to complete the full number of hours unpaid at a place I wasn\u2019t employed at. I honestly ended up working with my employer to fudge my placement - I worked as usual but did the assignments and my supervisor signed the papers. I was lucky to live far enough away from the school that my placement officer never made visits, only emailed my supervisor and had phone calls with me. For my final placement I was also lucky in that I work for a company with multiple locations, so for a month I worked at a different location and did the same thing. I understand that I falsified my placement but I don\u2019t feel bad about it - it felt like the only way I could continue paying my bills, and as someone who has worked in the field for 10 years I felt that it was ridiculous for me to have to complete placement in the first place.\n\nSome things I\u2019ve learned since that might help your income situation if your employer isn\u2019t willing to xommit fraud; apply for the \u2018ece grant\u2019 - google it, they give you a lump sum each semester to reimburse your tuition and some living costs. Also look into applying for OSAP - I was resistant to this because of the debt aspect, but looking back, the repayment of OSAP would have been more reasonable than straight missing out on income for the duration of placement. Also, ask your workplace about using up your sick/vacation time -  it may suck for the rest of the year, not being able to take days off, but it might help get you through this. Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019re DONE! You have a diploma and don\u2019t ever have to do it again. \n\nIt\u2019s hard, post secondary is meant for kids straight out of high school with the privilege of parents who are willing to pay there way - literally everyone else struggles, either by paying back debt over years, by pushing themselves to work and attend school at the same time, or by missing out on the opportunity to go to school altogether or until their later years. It\u2019s awful, I\u2019ve since become involved in advocating for paid placements and more equalized opportunities for education. Our education system is massively biased and unfair and needs to change.",

I was able to find one school that offered the ECE program tailored to suit working students (ex. classes between 10 and 2) but the classroom portion was only available as a hybrid option (online/in-person) with the campus being too far away.  \n\nI highly doubt my employer would be willing to fudge the paperwork.  I  wouldn't want to put them in that position.  I don't have sick/vacation time.  And in the end, if I chose to go to school, I would very likely lose my job and contacts (which is important to me to keep).",

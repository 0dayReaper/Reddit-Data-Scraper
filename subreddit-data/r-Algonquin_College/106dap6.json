I\u2019m in my last term and the osap dates mean nothing as they change if not confirm by the college that is why one person waits over a month and others get it quickly. Check with the registrars office\nFor example: my osap I applied in Nov for winter term my first check for osap was December 15 n it stated I will see a deposit Jan.6 to the 9\nMy second check was after new years Jan. 2 the date change to Jan.10-12\nMy third time checking osap was today and my new dates for osap is Jan 11-13 so dates again don\u2019t mean anything until campus confirms your registered",

Does it have any effect on the OSAP offer if I choose to input 60% course load over 100%, considering both are full-time?\n\nA bit about myself: I've been recently confirmed with my application to Algonquin College's Interactive Media Design program next spring term (May 2023).",

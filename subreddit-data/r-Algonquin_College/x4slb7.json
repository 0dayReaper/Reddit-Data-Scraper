Obviously we discourage people coming on holidays and emergency events but there are only a few set circumstances that we are going to tell you to leave.\n\nThat being said, if you are looking for your classes, please look with your eyes, and not with your hands. Some classes are secure rooms and aren\u2019t open for students outside class hours. If you find your class, note where it is, and go on to the next. Please do not attempt to gain access to the room if the door is closed as it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s a secure room.",

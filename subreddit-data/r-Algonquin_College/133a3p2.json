I know I passed them all, because I\u2019m in a program that has an evaluation and progression meeting and emails go out when you fail. I only received emails stating congratulations for passing first term. I\u2019m pretty pissed off that I\u2019ve been checking for days now and nothing. For the amount of money we pay to attend, is it asking too much to get our marks back in a timely manner? Like I get that they have many students, but I was never able to drag out my friggin deadlines like this wtf",

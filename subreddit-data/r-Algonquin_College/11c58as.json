    "postText": "I had a couple questions I hope they can all get answered:\n\nI graduated high school June 2022 and have taken calculus,  advanced functions, etc.\n\nI'm in a gap year right now but am planning to apply to the full time computer programming online program. \n\n1. Would I have to take any tests to get in, or would I be good since I've had good marks for advanced functions and calculus? \n\n2. Would above 90 be good to get in the program? Can anyone share what marks they got accepted into the program with?\n\n3. Can someone please explain the process of applying? How long did it take to get accepted after applying?\n\nI hope all my questions can get answered, thanks",

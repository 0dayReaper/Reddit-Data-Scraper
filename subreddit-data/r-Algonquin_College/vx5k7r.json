    "postText": "Hi, I'm a 2nd year student in university for aerospace engineering currently but I found I may overestimate my own ability and course difficulties. So, I'm looking for the college diplomas right now. \n\nAccording to college's course sequence, some programs usually have 8 courses or even 10 per semester. Because in university normally 5 courses per semester is the top, and 6 for those most excellent students who may need to sleep at library. And you may need a special permit from department to select 7 or more courses! So, can anyone explain how tough or stress about this or what's the study life in college?",

            "comment": "Don't make the mistake of assuming that College is \"easier\" than university. It tends to be more hands-on than theoretical, but that doesn't make it necessarily easier.\n\nDon't think about it in terms of number of courses per term, but rather number of hours.  When you do that, you'll find a college load to be quite similar to a university one.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m taking a 2yr diploma -6 courses per semester, 4 semesters. \n\nThings I wish I knew\u2026\n1) Because I started in January- my program takes no semester long breaks. Which has made working and studying harder. And burnout likely. \n2) Some classes are two hours long and others are three. The college is doing a new thing (new to me) where they teach hybrid classes meaning the class goes from 3 hours to 2 in person with 1 hour of independent work. Outside of typical HW / assignments etc. \n3) Might be program specific but compared to my friends at Uni, college (in my experience) has way more readings to do. This amplifies the time required to learn. \n\nHope this helps!",

    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m planning to move to Ottawa from Winnipeg to study at Algonquin College. I have a completed a previous degree already and I\u2019m in the midst of a crisis trying to figure out how I\u2019m going to ~afford~ to survive. I see that the college offers part time work to students but I was wondering what type of work is available and how hard is it to get a job on campus? I haven\u2019t paid my registration fee yet so I\u2019m limited to what I can see atm. Thanks!",

What would one recommend for a non-comp science background looking for a career change and already has a two year work ex? \n\n2. How easy are the programs with part time jobs? Is attendance compulsory? \n\n3. Which has better future prospects? CET\u2019s curriculum covers much more. Any graduates have an opinion on this?",

            "comment": "Prof here.\n\n1) Hard to tell.  Do you have a solid math background? Any kind of experience working with computers (Playing games does not count)? They both share the same level 1 and about 50% of their level 2.  So switching between them is possible, not always easy, but possible\n\n2-a)  Easy to have a part time job is not the word I would use. Again, this depends on your scholastic aptitude.  Many people come in thinking, I am good at school, no prob then get crushed.  Others just cruise through level 1 and 2 and then suffer, and others again, just cruise through to the end.  Both these programs are full time programs. Expect to be at the school 24+ hours per week and this is just for the classes.  This does not count gap time between classes where you could be sitting around 4+ hours.  You are also expected to do 2-3 hours of homework/study for each course per week.  At 5-6 courses, that is another 10-15 hours of study per week.  Weekends are pretty much the only time for a job.\n\n2-b) Attendance is compulsory for most profs. \n\n3) strangely enough the prospects are about the same.  They just prepare you for different industries.  CET tends to go more high-tech whereas CP tends to go more business/government, However this rule is not a set thing.  CET prepares you for more low level work, CP more business &amp; database.",

I have lots of friends who have gone through CET:CS, including one of my current employees.\n\nCET goes much more in-depth and covers a wide variety of different domains. If your goal is to get into programming and into the workforce in short order, my recommendation would be to go CP. If you'd like to do a deeper dive and potentially consider furthering your education by doing a Computer Science degree in the future, I'd suggest CET.\n\nCET is a harder overall as a program (46.51% vs 50.28% graduation rate), has a lower employment rate (75.49% vs 79.06%), and on a pay basis, is only slightly ahead ($42,000 vs $41857).  based on 2017-2018 statistics:[https://www.app.tcu.gov.on.ca/eng/labourmarket/employmentprofiles/compare.asp](https://www.app.tcu.gov.on.ca/eng/labourmarket/employmentprofiles/compare.asp)\n\nPart-time employment is possible - I was able to work 25 hours a week while in school but this requires very good time management on your part. Attendance is compulsory for the majority of professors and HIGHLY advised. If you need to miss a class or a lab, you may have the opportunity to make it up in another section but I'd avoid this where possible.\n\nI think that CET and CP really share similar outlooks for employment - CP would be the better choice if you want to be a code-monkey whereas CET might be better suited for an architect.",

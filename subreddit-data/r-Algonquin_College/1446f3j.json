    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a high school graduate.\n\nI saw that there are different 1 year programs who lead to a certificate. And I chose 2 that I am interested in.\n\n\\- As an International who graduated recently, Am I elligible to apply for a 1 year program?\n\n\\- If I finish the first program? Will I be able to apply for the second one easily (Without being sent back to my home country or somthing like that)?\n\n\\- Will I have a 1, 2 or 3 year Work Permit after  my graduation?",

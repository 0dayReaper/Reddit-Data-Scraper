So it has an on-campus, scheduled time and an online asynchronous time that doesn't have a set time.\n\n**Remote**: These are rarer but they came into prominence during the pandemic. It's an online course but it does have a set day/time that you would Zoom in with the rest of your class.\n\n\nIt ultimately sounds like your courses are hybrid so each course would have a scheduled, on-campus portion and an asynchronous portion. In terms of that July split, there's probably a different prof in the second half as that's common in the spring/summer semester.",

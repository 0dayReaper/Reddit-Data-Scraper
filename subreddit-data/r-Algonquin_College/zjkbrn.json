    "postText": "Hi guys. I got an offer for the 2023 Spring intake of the Computer Programming Co-op Option program. I got an offer for the 2023 Fall intake as well earlier.\n\nI am wondering if there is any drawback of the spring intake over the fall intake, such as fewer Co-op job opportunities, lack of financial aid / scholarships, worse professors. (I am an international student.)\n\nI would appreciate your insights. Thank you in advance !",

            "comment": "Co-op competition is a bit fiercer for summer co-op positions, due to conflict with other institutions also having co-op terms.\n\nSpring courses often have split profs(one does the first half, another does the second).\n\nRegardless, if you're going co-op stream, you do three terms of courses in a row (Fall, Winter, Spring or Spring, Fall, Winter).\n\nCampus is MUCH busier in the fall term. Parking spots are harder to get. Classes tend to have more students if it's the first term.\n\nThe average age of students starting in the Fall term seems to be lower, but that's anecdotal.\n\nFinding accommodation near campus is easier if you aren't competing with the Fall intake.\n\nRegardless, join the program discord if you have the chance. https://discord.gg/A93wGySN",

Which intake will have the summer co-op, spring or fall ? Is profs splitting an issue (if you have experienced this form of teaching) ?\n\nIf you were me, would you wait for the fall intake for its potential benefits when you can start it earlier in spring ?",

How was it?!** \n\n\u2014 Tell me about your long weekend!? What did you do? Did you get absolutely blacked out, hangout with some friends / family, or just \u201changout\u201d ? Let me know, down below if you wish - \n\n **Here\u2019s some tips for your College experience, whether you\u2019re a Freshman, or a returning student!** \n\n*(I swear I will try and make this exciting as possible)*\n\n#Numero Uno \n\n**Get to know people!!**\n\nSeriously. As another redditor just posted about this, saying \u201ctalk to people\u201d .. and making a rant post about it.. simply DO IT! :) It might make your nerves all anxious and all, but everyone else is just as nervous as you. So go out there, and literally just say \u201chey!\u201d or \u201chow\u2019s your day\u201d or literally, literally just anything. We\u2019re all human, and we need that social aspect in our life. \n\nCollege is 110% more amazing with friends. - heck, even Online works, if you\u2019re introverted... but push yourself out of that comfort zone, and you\u2019ll feel alive. Everyone\u2019s \u201cbored\u201d . Just talk !! \n\n*We\u2019re all introverted to some sense, and open up and become extroverted to those who we\u2019re comfortable with!*\n\n- If you\u2019re in Residence? You\u2019ll find so many new people. Write a sticky note on a door if youre so nervous! Go show up to those residence events, have some fun! \n\nMake lots of connections, and you wont regret it! \n\n#KAKS\n\nGoogle it, if you don\u2019t understand! \n\n**Get a Tutor or Counselor when you need one**\n\nLook it, not everyone is a genius, and can remember everything handed to them. If you need help, don\u2019t fret. You don\u2019t look \u201cdumb\u201d , \u201clame\u201d , whateverr you want to think... don\u2019t be shy to say you\u2019re not doing well. \n\nThis points back to Tip Numero Uno. \n\n**Talk.**\n\nPeople care about you, your classmates, and your professor. They want to see you do well !!! You\u2019re all a team. So if you need help? Get a tutor. Talk to a buddy in your class to help you, the teacher, or one assigned to you thru your **Colleges Student Success.**\n\nIf you\u2019re not feelin too hot, under the blue, and just want someone to talk to about things? Your student success will give you a student counselor to talk to. I can promise you that this will help you out tremendously, even if everything is okay - just say \u201cboo!\u201d and it will make their day. Everyone gets bored - just talk! :) \n\nHelp yourself out. Give yourself those grades you want. Talk to people - maybe a counselor! \n\n#THREEEE! \n\n**You need a calendar**\n\nLiterally. Trust me. \n\nYou\u2019ll have assignments thrown at you, left , right , and center. Dont just think \u201cI\u2019ll remember it\u201d .. **PLAN!!** your days, tests, assignments, etc., \n\nThat way, you won\u2019t get everything mixed up ... and wont be buggin the teacher saying \u201cwhen is this thing due again?\u201d \n\nDays go by a lot smoother knowing when you have something on the go the next day, or week. Makes you plan things easier. \n\n#FANTASTIC FOUR\n\n**What fantastic four movie is your favourite?**\n\n**Whats your favourite character from the movie?**\n\nSince we\u2019re talking about Fantastic Four, lets talk about \n\n**GROUP WORK and TEAMS!**\n\nAlso, kind of like Tobias \u201cFour\u201d Eaton, and Beatrice \u201cTris\u201d Prior... theres teamwork in that! \n\nYou all want to beat that \u201cbig boss\u201d at the end.. and defeat it with a massive score! \n\nThe best way to manage group work is to be a team player. Collaborate. Work together, and it\u2019ll be an easier path to victory instead of trying to make it a \u201ccompetition\u201d ... everyone wants a good mark - have clear Objectives, Roles, and make some rules, if it helps any. You can tie things in from other members from your portion, and vice versa. This creates \u201cflow\u201d ...\n\nNo one wants to listen through a boring powerpoint when everyone just reads the slides... so look up, get your other members to slip in a word or two of what you\u2019re saying - and it\u2019ll make it more enjoyable. \n\nThis way, you \u201cdefeat the boss\u201d , and get that beautifulll A+ . Which may be a \u201cHigh Score\u201d to you! \n\n#FAST 5\n\nYou like that I added in Fast and the Furious, eh? \n\nHopefully we all know Dom\u2019s 1970 Dodge Charger. If not, its pretty damn fast! \n\nSo let\u2019s relate this back at ya! \n\nYou definitely do not want to rush those assignments, tests, and get it all done super quickly. Even if is super duper simple... take your time, look through things, look for those keywords, and what they want you to do.. and do it to your best efforts...because your fast paced efforts? Probably are **not** your best... but we\u2019re all different, so who knows! Maybe this rule doesn\u2019t apply to you...\n\nBut take your time. Relax. Plan everything out. Work on it slowly, day by day a couple o days before the due date... just so you can review that assignment / study notes and make it all crystal clear. \n\n#SIX FLAGS\n\n**Try out new entertainment!**\n\nThis will bring back tip 1, 3, and 5. \n\nGo out and enjoy everything around your College campus, residence, and location you\u2019re living in. \n\nYou\u2019ll get to meet new people... but you\u2019ll definitely want to have some fun while at College. You\u2019ll learn **WAY MORE** about yourself while you\u2019re away in College. That\u2019s a fact! \n\nBut you cannot do this (I mean, literally be a rule breaker) if you don\u2019t have the free time needed when you plop everything into a calendar... and get it all done super fast just to try out new things. \n\nAllow yourself to have those well needed breaks, and enjoy the college experience! \n\n#SEVEN NATION ARMY\n\nCouldn\u2019t hold me back. \n\nDon\u2019t know the meaning behind the song? \n\nIt\u2019s about gossip, talking about eachother behind their backs.. atleast in my opinion, but also if you google it! He does mention it. \n\n**Stay away from Drama**\n\nLiterally, it\u2019s College. \n\nWe\u2019re all adults, and its a waste of time. Stay away from Drama as much as possible, if you can. \n\nIt\u2019s a negative space of energy, and it\u2019ll ruin your mood, and the other person\u2019s mood , and everyone who\u2019s involved. \n\nTry and stick with positive people, **meet new connections** , and live it up in a positive space. Nobody needs that negative energy, and bad friends.\n\nSo if you have someone in your life who is holding you back, away from your success and happiness? \n\nRip them away, and throw em out. \n\nYou\u2019ll be sad at first, but more alive than ever to find that negative person, gone.\n\n#Magic 8\n\nBonus. \n\n**Have fun!!**\n\nCollege goes by WAY too damn fast, you\u2019ll blink and it\u2019l be December. It just happens!! \n\nEnjoy your program / College while it lasts... because you\u2019ll miss it when its gone... does anyone else still miss High School? Because, same. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHope all of you do well in your program, and best wishes to you! \n\nGood luck! \n\nHave fun! \n\nStay safe\n\nTake care! \n\n- and hope you enjoyed these little tips! \n\n**If you have read all of this, tell me what program you\u2019re in! You\u2019ll be able to maybe meet new friends, who are in your program!**",

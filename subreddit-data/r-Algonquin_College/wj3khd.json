            "comment": "Hey OP, as an international student, you do not need to take the AC-HPAT exam, alternatively, you have to take a preparatory course, a one term long course called the Introduction to Canadian Health Studies. This course is mandatory for all international students enrolling in the practical nursing program at Algonquin and supposedly other medical programs. So if you are planning on enrolling in the fall intake, you'll take the ICHS course in September and you'll start your practical nursing program in January (winter intake).",

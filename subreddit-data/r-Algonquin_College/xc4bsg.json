    "postText": "I applied for the Interactive Media Design (Co-Op) program on 20th July 2022 through an Agency. At first they (Agency) told me it would take upto 2 weeks to get the offer letter, but now it's been nearly 8 weeks, They (Agency) keep saying it will take some more time every 2 weeks, Idk if anyone have to wait this much longer for an offer letter in this post-covid time or is this normal at this time ? \n\nAlso I didn't even got any Admission regarding mails from the college, I asked the agency what's the application status and they send me a screenshot of saying my application is under review. Did anyone else applying through agency get any confirmation mail from the college ?",

    "postText": "Hi im hoping someone can help. I recently signed up for an online bookkeeping course with langara but am having doubts on whether to proceed or switch to Algonquin. \nI notice that langara's modules on thr core bookkeeping concepts ( bookkeeping 1&amp; 2) only amount to a total of 39 hours. Thats 39 hours of zoom based face to face tuition with a lecturer. Algonquins course in bookkeeping teaches Financial accounting 1 &amp; 2 comprising a total of 120 hours. Although Algonquins course is just online material with no professor instruction, i don't understand how there can be such a disparity in teaching hours on the same subject. Is the Algonquin course much more in depth? I like the fact it also contains a maths for business course. Has anyone taken the bookkeeping course at Algonquin? Can you offer any insight?",

Also consider that teaching a bookkeeping software suite (for example, Quickbooks Online) could extend the courses' hours.",

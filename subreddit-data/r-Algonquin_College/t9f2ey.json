    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in lvl 1 of CST coop program and want to know what will happen if I\u2019m no longer eligible for coop. After lvl 3 there is two terms of coop. Will I just be off for 8 months or will I continue to level 4? If i am off for those 2 terms can I do my own student internship with the government (fswep) or with some private organization? I understand that I won\u2019t get the coop certificate but all that matters to me is the work experience.",

            "comment": "If you can keep your cumulative GPA above 2.7 (70%) after compleating level 2 and secure a Co-op position, Algonquin may let you continue with the Co-op even if your GPA slips below 2.7 after level 3.   If not, you can continue with level 4 of the CST program.  FSWEP can be difficult to secure on your own if you don't \"know someone\".\nMy son is just completing his second CST Co-op and will start level 4 in May.",

That\u2019s the thing that makes me nervous. That I won\u2019t be able to put any industry related experience or certifications on my resume plus the fact that I don\u2019t interview well. That\u2019s why I wanted to take some time off after lvl 2 and go for a certification but I was told that I\u2019ll be taken off the coop stream if I withdraw from the program. Keeping my gpa above 2.7 shouldn\u2019t be a problem.",

His resume only consisted of 10 months as a cleaner in a Gym, no industry experience.\nMy son also has Asbergers and is nervous and not great with people, but he is doing well at his service desk Co-op this term.\n\nIt seams to me there are more coop jobs than students.  My son actually missed the first round of coop applications last May but had multiple offers from the June application process.\nI hope this helps and good luck.",

    "postText": "I am moving to Ottawa as an international student and I secured my 12 month lease with Envie Student , Little Italy I. Quad private room so I will have 3 other random roommates. I chose Envie because it looked so well on the website and gave them a call, everything went smoothly and I signed it. I'll be attending Algonquin College so it's like a 30 minute bus ride. I was worried I couldn't find any good places to live and signed the first opportunity I found. But now I am having doubts and worries because I saw mostly negative reviews on Envie.\n\nI am open to any suggestions for my situation. Looking for condos, dorms like Envie. If I regret Envie, I could do a sublet and move somewhere else, preferably.",

Other than that there\u2019s scheduled cleaning, included wifi which can be unreliable sometimes, decent amenities, concierge, penthouse and a bunch of other stuff. I\u2019ve had multiple friends living there since 2016 and they generally liked it. Overall it\u2019s decent.",

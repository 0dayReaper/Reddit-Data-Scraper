Wondering if anyone here has taken CST2335 - Mobile Graphical Interface Programming - specifically the AC Online version - and whether there are any materials, textbooks, resources one would recommend to best prep for success in this course. I've heard mixed things on this one so if anyone has any impressions as well would be happy to hear them. \n\nCheers!",

So I can\u2019t fully answer the question, but I\u2019ll try to help a little\u2026\n\nWe used android studios as our IDE, so you could download and play around with that\u2026 otherwise it was mostly step by step instructions though brightspace and a few videos\u2026 primarily we used Java and some xml. From what I could tell, a lot of it is about learning how to use the software and how to link the Java and xml. I\u2019d compare it to web programming in semester 2\u2026 it\u2019s difficult and sometimes annoying, but easy enough to understand",

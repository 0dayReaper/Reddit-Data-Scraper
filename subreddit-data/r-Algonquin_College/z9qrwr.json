Who will be taking the test at the end of December, and was wondering if anyone who has recently taken the test, could give me some help on what they remember for the test or what they studied to help prepare for it.\n\nI have been studying for weeks and got the math, English, and chem down. But was wondering about the bio and physics side of it.\n\nCould you guys give me any advice?\nThank you so much",

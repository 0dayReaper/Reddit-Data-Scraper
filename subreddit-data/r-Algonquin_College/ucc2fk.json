I'm looking for some guidance before I start; what should I be expecting and how can I prepare in advance?\n\nA little background info on me, I'm a working architect with a Bachelor's degree and looking to enrich my knowledge in sustainable building.\n\nAnyone have a list of books I should have that aren't already on the college's web..etc, etc.\n\nAny advice will help, thank you :)",

When it's an animation week, all the design classes become animation. When it's design week, all the animation classes become design classes.\n\nWith hybrid, I believe only the first class of the week for animation/design is in person, then the rest online.\n\n...it's confusing for sure, and can take time to get used to. \n\nAlso, I'm in an discord sever for animation students starting this year if you want an invite! Just send me a message! (Not first year myself tho, I'm second year)",

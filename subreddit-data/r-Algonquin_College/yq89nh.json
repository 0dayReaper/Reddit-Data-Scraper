I took the fungus among us and loves it since it was fun and only needed about an hour dedication a week. I was looking into reading for recreation but wasn\u2019t sure if it was many books with many essays or just a few.",

There\u2019s also discussion board posts once in a while which are also extremely easy and then there\u2019s a personal diet plan and a personal exercise plan which are a bit bigger but they each take like an hour max to do",

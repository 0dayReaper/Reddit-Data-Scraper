The 1 tells you it is on the first floor. The room number is 144. There is a find your room map available on the website and there will be a lot of volunteers around campus the first week helping people find there way. If truly lost, go the the second floor and then go to your building. With minor exception, the 2nd floor connects all buildings.",

    "postText": "TLDR: does anyone know if the college\u2019s health services offer treatment on PCOS? And what is the price to buy birth control pills there? \n\nI am a current student known to have PCOS and was on birth control pills prescribed by doctors. I haven\u2019t been taking any pill for years since my condition improved, but it seems to have worsened recently.\n \nI would like to visit the college\u2019s Heath Services and receive treatment, but I am not sure if the consultation and treatment are going to be covered by insurance, given this is a \u201cknown condition\u201d at the time I got my insurance plan.\n \nIn case either of them is not covered, I would like to buy birth control pills directly from there so I would greatly appreciate if anyone could advise the approximate cost of the pills (was on Nordette previously).",

            "comment": "It's great that you're considering seeking help from your college's health services. They should be able to provide you with the necessary treatment, including an examination and advice on birth control pills that are specific to your condition. In terms of insurance, it's best to check with your provider directly to see if they cover pre-existing conditions. \nAs for the cost of birth control pills, it can vary depending on the brand and dosage prescribed. At your college's health services, the cost may be lower compared to purchasing them from an outside pharmacy. It would be best to inquire directly with their office. \nI hope this information has been helpful. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.",

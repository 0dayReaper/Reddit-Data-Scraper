    "postText": "I have PTSD and really bad anxiety. There's a two hour break between my classes right now and my PTSD was triggered on the LRT this morning. I just want a place where I can cry it out until my next class. I'm in one of the bathrooms right now but I'm too para oud about other people to stay here, and there's just too much noise.\n\nDoes anyone know about a place where I can hide for a bit? I just want to be somewhat isolated. I've been out of school for over a decade now and this all just feels very new to me. I don't know what to do.",

There is also a few \"Quiet spaces\" in support services (third floor of E building)... at least so I was led to believe by a student that had massive social anxiety and often would need an \"unload\" location.  If nothing else, support services can probably give you a hand with this.  [https://www.algonquincollege.com/studentsupportservices/mental-health/](https://www.algonquincollege.com/studentsupportservices/mental-health/)\n\nOther than that, B building often has empty classrooms and/or practically abandoned washrooms, especially on the 3rd floor.\n\nThere is also a staircase on in E that goes past the 3rd floor for room access.  It is possible to climb those stairs and hide at the top (at least last time I checked).",

(My 1 and 2 are the best hiding places)",

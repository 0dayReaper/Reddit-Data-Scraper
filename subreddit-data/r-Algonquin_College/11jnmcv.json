Be prepared to put the work in because the program is a full time commitment for real. I don't recommend working during one year programs. I literally put in 6 hours-12 hours a day in school 7 days a week. But maybe it's different for every program. As long as you know that going in I think you'll be capable of giving it your all in the program.",

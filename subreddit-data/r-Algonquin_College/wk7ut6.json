You get small tid bits of information most students don\u2019t know about like box office selling send tickets or free movie passes, so I don\u2019t think you should be basing the experience of others on an experience you should go and do. Many students don\u2019t attend and they are lost, in some cases you might even be able to meet your profs for one on one but I highly recommend attending",

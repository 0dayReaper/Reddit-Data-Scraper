    "postText": "Can any current students provide some insight on how placements are assigned? The program outline says 3rd year students will be placed in either Kingston/Belleville/Brockville, or in Ottawa/ Pembroke/Brockville. \n\nIs it easier to be placed outside of the Ottawa region? I am currently located in one of these regions and would prefer to come back to that region post-grad.",

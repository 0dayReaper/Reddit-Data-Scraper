            "comment": "Currently in my 3rd semester in Business Marketing. Here are some points I'd keep in mind:\n\n1. I started in the winter 2021. Something to keep in mind, the program accelerated us (winter section) to catch up with the students who started in fall. The winter sections had to take a full course load in the summer, which had its challenges.\n\n2. This program isn't a walk in the park. If you don't do the work you will fail. There is a TON of group work, if you get a tough team, it makes the courses exponentially more difficult. My class size probably dropped by 40-50% since the start.\n\n3. There is a paid co-op, but you have to find your own job/apply for opportunities.\n\n4. The profs are awesome and you can learn a ton from them. Many are still working in sales/marketing/market research and have lots of current real world experience and some also teach at Sprott/Telfer.\n\n5. I would highly recommend it if you want it, you get out of it what you put into it. Algonquin rocks.\n\nHope this helps!",

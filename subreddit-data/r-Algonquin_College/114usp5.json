Like, will there be no chance for me to take a semestral break if ever?\n\nI am eyeing on Computer Programming and Interactive Media Design. And I am also an international student if that matters.",

You end up in classes for 16 months straight so really think about if you can handle it, the burn out near the end hit me hard.\n\nThe only real bonus I can think of is you go into semester 3 a little fresher than the fall start people",

So regardless of your intake time, you will be doing 12 months straight school.\n\nNow in Computer Programming, if you qualify for co-op, you will then have 8 months of co-op and then a final term to wrap things up.  Otherwise, you are doing all 4 levels back to back to back.  The good news is, you are done in 16 months.  The bad news is, you are tired.",

AC day 1 is more fun in the fall As in winter AC day, one isn\u2019t as fun and there\u2019s not as many activities that are outside if you\u2019re an outdoor person. (My own opinion)",

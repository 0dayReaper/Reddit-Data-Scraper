    "postText": "Hi, guys. I have been thinking of doing the one year Human Resources Management certificate at Algonquin College. I was just wondering how rigorous would the program be for someone with little to none business background? I have a Bachelors of Science but I am planning to change my trajectory, and I have been super nervous about grasping concepts I am not familiar with",

I get paranoid with group work and am more adapted to independent work, but it\u2019s fine as long as they are cooperative and are willing to share the work fairly.",

For me we used to have 2-3 meeting per week for discussing the progress for the team project, it\u2019s better for you to start doing your work ASAP as there\u2019s a lot of content for some project. \nAlso make sure you keep all the record for meetings in the team log so that you can provide more evidence for non contributing members when you submitted your peer evaluation for each project",

I only have beginner\u2019s knowledge on grade 11 Accounting with balancing sheets and a few very basic concepts. But nothing beyond it like forecasting, budgeting, etc. Do you think this course will pose as a challenge without being familiar with accounting and finance beforehand?",

So no worry\u2026",

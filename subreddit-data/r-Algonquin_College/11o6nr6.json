    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI will be moving to Ottawa soon and I would like to upgrade my career. I am interested in working in the field of artificial intelligence; I have a Bsc in Mathematics but I have little programming experience and all of my jobs since graduating have been unrelated to my degree. Does anyone here have experience with the above program? Any idea what kind of co-ops are available and if they will lead to decent jobs upon graduating? Any input is appreciated. Thank you.",

            "comment": "I am in this program, it is the first year they have ever done it. I went in with a degree in an unrelated engineering program because I couldn't get a job after graduating. I didn't have very much programming experience beforehand. Most people in the program (90%) are international students who all have degrees or masters from their respective countries, although technically you can get in with a diploma.\n\nSince it's the first year, it's hard to know if my complaints about the program are just growing pains or the job market or what. Artificial Intelligence is still relatively new, most jobs you might be thinking of are in R&amp;D, this program will likely not help you get an R&amp;D job. They do not teach you the math behind anything (only very surface level), they teach you how to use prebuilt functions and when to use different techniques. Most exciting jobs in AI require a master's or Ph.D., this program may help you get into a master's program, but it definitely is not a replacement. As a result, even with my lack of programming experience, I find this program relatively easy compared to my engineering program.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the co-op pool through the school is shared with the people who do computer programming. I think there were maybe 4 actual AI jobs (there are around 20 people in the program, and those 4 jobs are not exclusive to us). A lot of the jobs are in data science, software development, and web development. Half of those were probably government jobs. The good news is you don't have to apply to jobs through the school, you can also apply to the co-op jobs posted on other job boards. I would say those are usually more exciting. You can monitor those for yourself before you apply to this program. I personally was a bit disappointed at what the school was offering but it is hard to know if it is due to it being a new program or the tech layoffs. The good news is that being a coop student makes you way more employable, so you should be able to find something. You probably could find a co-op job in cybersecurity with your math degree. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much for the detailed reply!\n\nI think you are correct about most jobs in AI requiring a masters or PhD. A friend of mine is a PhD candidate in an AI-adjacent field and has also shared his doubts about breaking in without grad school. It's great to have some insight into what this program specifically has to offer in that regard.\n\nIn my case it sounds like the main attraction of this program would be the co-op opportunities. Do you think they are worth the price of the program? I haven't had great luck applying to any job that involves programmming but I am taking some time off work soon to send out a huge wave of applications. Just trying to weigh as many options as possible.\n\nThanks again, all the best!",

If you are just looking at breaking into software development, you definitely can get a coop job doing that. If you want something with your math degree, might be harder (I'm not sure what math majors do though tbh).\n\nWhile I am not completely satisfied with the contents of the program, in my situation I think it probably was worth the price. I could not find a job after uni, and I used my status as a coop student to get two offers, one as an AI developer, and one for an electrical engineer. I don't think I could have gotten either without the status of being a co-op student. Algonquin also seems to have a good relationship with the government, if you want to work in the public sector, this will 100% get you that.\n\nIf you are just looking to get some software experience, this program will give you that. Pretty much every course is filled with coding in python, and while it's pretty easy to pick up, it's a lot of self teaching and I feel like I'm not learning the best practices. The good news is that there's a lot of projects to fill your resume with. Also, if software development is your focus and not specifically AI, I've heard Algonquin is starting a new graduate certificate in Cloud Computing, which is probably a more employable field.\n\nI haven't looked at it very much, but I know OttawaU (and probably Carleton) have some academic upgrading post grad stuff. I don't think they include co-op but that's another option to look at.",

Like I said, the coop through the school is shared with the computer programming course (and probably other similar programs) so any pay information you find on those more established programs will likely carry over. [OttawaU](https://www.uottawa.ca/current-students/career-experiential-learning/coop/coop-programs/hourly-salaries) and [Carleton](https://carleton.ca/employers/hire-co-op/i-hired-a-co-op-student/co-op-salary-survey/) post their pay as well, you'll be competing with them for a lot of jobs (although they often get better jobs because even though this is a postgraduate program, some companies only post to universities. This might just be because this program is new). Also note, the coop can only be 4 months, the school does not allow for longer ones for some reason. That means if you work for the government and make 21 $/hr, after 4 months you'll likely be hired on and be making 30 $/hr.",

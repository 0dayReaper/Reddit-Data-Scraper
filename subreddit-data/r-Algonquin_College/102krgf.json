    "postText": "I\u2019ll be starting PN in September.  I am interested in seeing if I can save a bit and buy used textbooks, but I was wondering how that works if there\u2019s an access code needed for the book for the extra online parts.  \n\nDo any of the classes require this access to the online component?\nI don\u2019t want to miss out on something (quizzes etc) and am an audio/visual learner.\n\nThanks!",

There\u2019s only a select few you actually need for a code that I don\u2019t have. (I graduated in June! Message me for the the link! It\u2019s a Google classroom w resources and textbooks etc!)",

    "postText": "So i was planning on going to uni but it didnt workout so i plan on going to Algonquin College for tech but idk if my grades are good enough. I plan on going for Computer Engineering Technology for 3 years. All my classes were uni level so idk how it transfers to college.\n\n My grades are 65 on MCR4U, 68 on ENG4U and a 93 on ICS4U. I plan on upping my english since its only midterm but math is final unless i take it again.\n\nOh and also is calculus and vectors necessary for this program?\n\nIs it possible for me to get in or nah",

            "comment": "Hi, correction to the above statement, sorry. \n\nYou have to loop at the program requirements and that will indicate if you are eligible to get into the program. The way the post-secondary system is set up will see High School University classes (anything ending with \"U\", if I recall correctly) is greater than College or Mixed  classes. \n\nThat means if the program requirements say you require English, Grade 12 (ENG4C or equivalent) but you have ENG4U, you still meet the requirement. \n\nWhen it comes to program requirements that say \"Mathematics, (Grade 12 MCT4C) or (Grade 11 MCR3U) or equivalent; or (Grade 12 MAP4C with a grade of 80% or higher) or Grade 11 MCF3M with a grade of 70% or higher)\" you have to read carefully and break it down:\nWhat you require is one of the following: \nGrade 12 MCT4C (College Level)\nGrade 11 MCR3U (University Level)\nGrade 12 MAP4C with a grade of 80% or higher (College Level but the type of math taught was not focused on what MCT offers, hence the grade requirement)\nGrade 11 MCF3M with a grade of 70% or higher (College/University Level) \n\nFYI:\nMCT classes look at advanced functions and more complex math equations leading to derivatives and Matrixes depending.\nMAP classes look at a basic(slightly) understanding of advanced functions geometry, trigonometry, and financial math.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you want me to clear anything up. Good luck! \n\np.s. look at the program page for the program availability, I think the program you want is waiting for the Fall. Also, no need to improve your ENG4U since the program is only asking for you to have completed the class and not received a certain mark.\nBut you should keep this in mind \"Should the number of qualified applicants exceed the number of available spaces, applicants will be selected on the basis of the proficiency in English and mathematics.\"",

            "comment": "You do take a calculus course in the program and you also you do numerical methods which has some calc 2 in it so I would say you do need calculus but I don't think it's required to take it in highschool. I had U courses and got in just fine they don't care if it's U or C. I know some people who had the same grades as you and still got in and they're doing fine.If you want to still go to uni I would suggest you do one year in this program and get good grades then just transfer to uni. Both UOttawa and carelton let you transfer to them from college without looking at your highschool grades from what I saw.\n\nI am currently in third year and I didn't know I could do that otherwise I would've done that after my first year because this program isn't really a Bach in engineering and not accredited by the engineering board so people will look down on you in the industry and treat you like you don't know what you're doing which is why I plan on going to uni after I graduate.\n\nSo spare yourself the waste of time do 1 year then go to uni if you think you're able to do good in uni.\n\nNOTE: This program is good if you need to get a job quick and get good pay like 70K or so but if you're looking to become an engineer then go for uni. Also if you don't have enough money for uni right now you could do this program which is less than a uni program and make some money through co-op then go to uni after.",

I live with my family in Ottawa but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll study from here it\u2019s very chaotic. \n\nHow do you pay for residence, is it like a monthly rent situation? Does OSAP cover it/part of it? Can I bring my cat?",

So, I kinda have no choice unless I rent a room before even looking at it. \ud83d\ude02\n\nIn your case I would stay with the family but college residence can be great as well(have lived at college residence in BC).\n\nPros: less travel, could focus more on studies(depends if you are disciplined), don't have to cook, easy for group studies etc.\n\nCons: expensive, food is ok, could take some time getting used to things (roommate, residence rules etc)\n\nIf I were you, I would see what I value more and make a decision according to that.\n\nGood luck \ud83e\udd1e",

I could either stay with family (don\u2019t really know them so I\u2019m not sure) and do my coop I\u2019m the UK or just do a remote coop at a canadian company while living abroad. \n\nThank you!

But you always have people around. \n\nPersonally I would compare rent and meal plan vs living on your own or with roommates, you can still visit people on res for the party vibes. But when I was paying res was much more expensive after calculating meal plan and costs all to share a small room and communal kitchen. I saved money by leaving res, not sure if its still the case but I would assume so",

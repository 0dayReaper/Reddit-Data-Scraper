    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI'm the guardian of a student at algonquin college. She seems to have failed level 1 of the program but her timetable for next sem is for level 2. I saw that the Passing GPA is 1.7 but she got lower than that. If she failed but her timetable says level 2 course does she go? I've contacted the academic department tonight and ill probably hear from them a few days later, but want to see any of your experiences with this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

Good luck to her! College is hard!",

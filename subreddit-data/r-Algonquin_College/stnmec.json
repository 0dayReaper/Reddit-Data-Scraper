I saw the Algonquin website say this:\n\n\"February 18: Acceptance offers to highly competitive programs are sent out. Accepted applicants will receive a letter through mail. Keep your contact details up to date on ASCIS to ensure you receive your offer in a timely manner.\"\n\nEventhough it says wait for a letter, I asked a professor if it would be updated on ASCIS and she said yes. Hope this helps.",

It\u2019s a freaking great program, but I think I\u2019m going to opt for taking it over 3.5 years instead of 2.5 years because I value sleep, exercise, volunteering,  and I want t to work once a week as well. (According to the program head, we can take up to 6 years to complete the program.)\n\nIf anyone has any questions, I may be able to answer based on my experiences from 1st semester.",

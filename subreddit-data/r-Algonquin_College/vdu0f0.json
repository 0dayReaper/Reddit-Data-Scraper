If you could explain that that would be amazing.\n\nAnd second question, can I order\nstuff to my dorm? Like from\nAmazon and personal packages\nthrough DHL and stuff?",

The meal plan is basically a couple thousand dollars that you can spend with your student card at all the campus restaurants and cafeterias. It is up to you to budget the money to last the duration of your stay. \n\nYes you can order things to residence. There is a mail room in the back lobby where each room has a small mail box. For larger packages, the front desk will call you or email you to pick it up at the desk.\n\n(Assuming you are talking about the Ottawa campus)\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions :)",

Super helpful for studying those portions. For the sciences, you're only given 25 questions for chem and bio, 10 for physics. Physics is going to be basic math formulas, so if you can set up and rearrange equations you'll be fine. I'm not 100% sure but I don't think you'll be given the formulas for physics. For bio you should feel comfortable with cells, the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the digestive system, and the immune system. I'm not sure about chemistry because we haven't been given any info on that one yet!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck :)",

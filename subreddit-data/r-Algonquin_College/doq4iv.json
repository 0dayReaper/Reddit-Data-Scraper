Oh.\n\nHow about we send you four or five envelopes a year addressed from the Alumni \"&amp; Friends\" Association with nothing but advertisements for Johnsons Insurance? \n\nI mean, it's just a planet. Who cares if we condone wasting resources.\n\nCome on Algonquin. Do better.  \n\nIs this all the alumni association does? This is the only correspondence I've received from the alumni insurance peddlers association since graduating.",

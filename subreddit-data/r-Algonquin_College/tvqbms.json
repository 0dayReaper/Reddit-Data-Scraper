    "postText": "Hello am looking for an rpn  student who has student residence on campus so I can have a place to rest in btn farther apart classes for example if you finish one class at 2pm and the next class is at 7pm...and return if they also want to get off campus for sometime they can come chill at my place too. I live in altavista. Let me know in the comments if this works for you. I prefer same programme please. (RPN)",

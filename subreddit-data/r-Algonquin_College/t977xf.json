    "postText": "Hi everyone. \n\nI have just been accepted to AC Online for Office Administration. Looking for advice on laptops. I currently have a chromebook and was told this won\u2019t be suitable (I expected as much). However the only information I can find for laptops on the website is telling me I need i7 500gb blah blah, aka a $1500 laptop. Has anyone used a reasonably priced laptop and had no trouble?? Surely not every student goes out and buys a $1500 laptop, that is the same price as my tuition!! \nPlease help.",

Any laptop with less than 1tb of storage you should try and pick up an external hard drive/ssd for extra room for docs/backups\n\nLG gram Ultra-Lightweight https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08T6M27JB/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_DVDY6WA4PR6PFJD9GHN5\n\nThis laptop is a bit lighter meaning something more portable if you end up on campus for classes/studying. One con is only 2 USB type A ports, meaning mouse + one other peripheral. Same as before, recommend picking up an external storage\n\nAsus 15.6\u201d FHD Laptop  https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08VBY72WP/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_N10Z6KTH1BGJC07QZVW4\n\nAsus is a recognizable brand, this isn't one of their top of the line laptops, but should get the job done. Common so easy to find replacement parts (like power adaptors if you happen to lose it)/repair\n\nAcer Swift 3 https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08YD1JLJF/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_MK8TV4YX38C6P9G24C1M\n\nAcer laptops are generally more budget friendly laptops, they work (most of the time). \n\n\nHope this helps, if not feel free to reply",

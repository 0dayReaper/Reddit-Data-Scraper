            "comment": "It actually depends on what program your in. If you\u2019re a first year and its your first ever post secondary program they will block you on a section. I believe in your second or third term you can make changes through acsis. \n\nYou can add, drop, or change your schedule as long as they don\u2019t overlap each other. Just be cautious in doing so as this can affect you\u2019re status from being full time to part time. And if you have OSAP funding or an international student this can mess you up. \n\nAlso, some courses are only offered in certain terms so you need to pay attention on your course schedules. My program before was in business and there were a lot of classes running so I had no issues changing my schedule. However, if your program is niche there could be only one section running each term.\n\nBe aware also that these is limited, depends if the program coordinator allows it. If your in a program that restricts changes, your have to go through your student specialist to help you out.\n\nGood luck!",

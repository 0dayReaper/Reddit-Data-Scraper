    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI'm considering future studies in construction engineering and was wondering if anybody on here knew how useful the technician and technologist programs might be for breaking into the job market.\n\nI'm a carpenter currently working towards my Red Seal, but I'm looking into possible ventures to ladder into after I complete it, as I know I don't want to spend the rest of my career just being a carpenter. I work primarily in the ICI sectors and other careers I have interests in are surveying, project management, site supervision, and inspection. Would I be able to get these jobs with the 2 or 3 year program, and do the job postings tend to be abundant?\n\nWould love to hear from anybody with experience in either of these programs!",

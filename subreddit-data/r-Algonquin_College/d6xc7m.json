    "postText": "Hey guys I was in E building today around 12pm and was approached by a guy with a pin. On the pin it states that he is deaf and that he makes these pins to make income and that it costs 2$ to keep the pin. What he does is he hands out the pins and then hangs around waiting to come pick them up again, he will stand next to you untill you say no or give him the money he wanted. I heard about this scam somewhere on r/Ottawa but only actually finally have seen it in the wild. Its my first time at Algonquin but I knew about this scam but I saw many other students actually fall for it. \n\nHeres a image of the pin  [https://imgur.com/a/M4R56ot](https://imgur.com/a/M4R56ot)",

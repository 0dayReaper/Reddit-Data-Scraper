The rest were theory based which applies your knowledge. In terms of studying focus on Newtons Laws, Circuits, waves and motion. I unfortunately don\u2019t remember actual questions as I was stressed beforehand and did a complete brain dump after I was done. The physics portion was not as bad I thought it would be (given I\u2019ve never done physics).",

    "postText": "Looking at taking the Computer Programming course, through the online route.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? I would love to do a Co-op but moving right not just is not in the cards. I've been debating between a local 2 year technical college, bootcamp, or something like this program. The Algonquin program seems like it is the most affordable option, and for some reason would look the best on a resume to myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground I am 30sM who already has a bachelor of commerce majoring in Finance. I will be coming from a property assessment background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe industry sounds horrible right now for entry level devs, but I am hoping in a year or twos time things will change. Anyone who has recently graduated or taken this program recently I would love your input. Also is the part time route an option for someone employed?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I finished this program earlier this year and did full-time, and if you can spend time in a co-op or an internship, I would highly recommend it, a lot of places ask for a bachelors but if you have work experience then you look like a good option still. There was one student in the unofficial discord that swapped from online to co-op, so there is a way to switch part way through the program.\n\nI had a fairly good experience going through the online version of the program. There was one problem instructor/facilitator, a gentleman by the name of Eugene who was no help at all. My other instructors/facilitators may have been frustrating at times but did seem to care about the lessons and what I was learning. The Database instructor/facilitator, Chris, is great.\n\nMy overall experience, the lessons seemed to cover concepts and teach you, and then the assignments seemed to fit what the lessons taught. There was a small hand full of times when it seemed like material needed for assignments was covered in later assignments but I wouldn't consider it a rampant problem. There is a lot of material that comes from external websites and YouTube, but if those do not click with your learning style then you kinda know what to google based on the keywords used in the articles or videos. Some classes just point you to the language or database documentation to learn how to use it, and that was frustrating because some documentation was meant more for reference and not education.\n\nAlso, online learning isn't for everyone, and that's okay. I would think about taking a free course to see if you are actually absorbing the lessons and can stick to the schedule you envisioned for yourself doing part-time.",

Also, one course already referenced concepts taught at a later module which was so confusing. It feels very cheap considering the material in some courses is literally copy pasted from blogs and the facilitator doesn't even try to break it down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said any masters of googling will be fine!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat was the most stressful course or assignment?",

            "comment": "I'm in term 3 of this program right now.\r  \n\r  \nIt's very much a teach yourself program after term 1. I've been using Google and YouTube to learn, NOT the course content.\r  \n\r  \nThe module content is usually a copy paste from a wikihow type of website article or from the textbook for that class. I feel like they are just a dump of information and concepts, not explained well at all and require you to google or find a YouTube video that ACTUALLY explains the information or concept. The content is usually all over the place too in terms of when information is introduced. For example: You'll be looking for information to complete the assignment related to that module only to realize that for some reason that information is covered 5 modules later or not at all.\r  \n\r  \nThe assignments are going to be VERY vague with their instructions. They will also require you to know some concepts that were NOT covered in any of the modules. The only solution to this is to pester your facilitators with emails asking for clarification and also Google. It's so easy to fall behind in this program because of this so try your best to start assignments early because you will need to email your facilitators for clarification and they might take a day or two to get back to you.\r  \n\r  \nSome of the facilitators are great. Others are going to be a pain when trying to get your questions answered and you'll need to send them follow up emails when they forget to answer your email.\r  \n\r  \nI'll say that for me, I'm not at all satisfied with the learning experience in this program. I feel like the program is centered around testing you rather than teaching you.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point I'm only here for the piece of paper you get after graduation and will likely take a Udemy course to fill in the gaps later.",

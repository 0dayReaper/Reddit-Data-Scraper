I'm thinking about switching to other program and wavering between selecting computer programming (coop seems to be selling factor however it might be quite challenging for international student) or going for MAD&amp;D (which received a lot of positive feedback on Reddit \uff09\nAny comments from current students or recent graduate would be helpful,  Thank you in advance!",

But I could demonstrate that Web development students find hard to land a co-op position, even for permenant residents. My friend is seeking now a non-paid position to meet college's graduation requirements. So maybe switcing a program may be beneficial to you. Good Luck! BTW, i choose a program under the same faculty: Computer system technician- Networking. How do you think of this program?",

Thanks for bringing up networking technician program as alternative option.  I didn't know much about this program, I suppose it mainly focus on network administration instead of coding?  Do u know any information regarding employment rate of this program? I think I might switch to a program that have better chance of landing a job in tech",

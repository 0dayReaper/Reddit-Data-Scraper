Can anyone give me some insight on how AC online is set up? \u201cWork at your own pace\u201d does this mean I won\u2019t have scheduled \u201conline\u201d classes to attend to? If so, how is the courses set up? I\u2019ve emailed and called my program coordinator but no reply yet. Thank you",

However, there will be a established dates and deadlines for your assignments and you will be expected to work at your own pace to ensure you completed the work by the due dates.",

    "postText": "Hi all! I am an international student from India. So I got an offer letter from Humber for the User Experience Design certificate program at North Campus Winter 23 intake) and I also got another offer letter from Algonquin college for Interdisciplinary Studies in Human-Centred Design (Fall intake 22). I am a bit confused between the two.\n\nI am more inclined towards Algonquin college but from what I have heard both the programs are more research inclined which I don't mind. I'm just having a hard time selecting between the two while not knowing much about the in-college experience. Anyone who has taken either of the two courses/colleges could share their experiences. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "One thing to consider is the cost of living in both areas. I'm pretty sure Toronto is more expensive than Ottawa, though Ottawa is still pricey. The nightlife is better in Toronto, I find Ottawa has more green spaces and more active (this is what brought me here). Ottawa is a city but has a small town feel to it at the same time. Unfortunately I have only done online schooling due to covid so I'm not sure how lectures are, but I have been on campus and really like the Algonquin one. Can't say much about the programs since I'm not in them, sorry. Hope this helped a bit",

Humber UX solely focuses on UX design and you'll learn anything you need to become a product/UX designer whereas Algonquin ISinHCI is likely to teach you the methods, workflows in design world (not only UX and more in-depth HCI things). You should choose based on your preferences only.   \n\n\nBy the way, how many days/months it took you to hear back the admission results from both of them?",

Missed out your reply, thank you for replying &lt;3\nI am planning to go for Humber &amp; then decide there if I need to do another course which will be Algonquin one.\n\nFor Humber it took them exactly 31 days and Algonquin replied after 3 months :(( which delayed my plans ahead that's why I'm going with Humber",

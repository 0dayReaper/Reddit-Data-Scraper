    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an online student, and they told me the tuition does not cover my health insurance, so I have to pay it if I want. \nThey have two options either go on campus, which I can't, and pay it there, or on the phone, so I give them my card number so they can take the money from it, which is so weird!  How I'm supposed to give my card bank number to someone, I don't know. \n\nDid anyone go through that?\nPlease help!",

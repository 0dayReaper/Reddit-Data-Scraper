    "postText": "I recently got accepted for both programs but am unsure which to take. I mainly want to do 3D modelling and get into texturing and such, however, I don't know which to take. I'm not entirely a fan of doing programming however I am proficient at it. but I do want to study in a creative field, hopefully get into the game industry. Specifically, specialize in 3D and the art side of things.\n\nI got accepted for the 1-year Foundation Animation and 3-year Game Dev program. Which one should I take?",

            "comment": "If it's the Game industry that you want to get in, Game Dev is probably your best bet. That being said, you will have to do a good amount of programming. Fortunately the program is set up so each semester starting in level 02, you pick an elective that's either creative or programming. The way it's set up now means that students who want to focus on more of the creative side, don't have to do as much programming and vice versa. \n\n\nThere is a major difference in the credentials though and thus, amount of time in the programs. Game Dev is an Advanced Diploma three-year diploma whereas Animation Foundation (assuming you mean Drawing Foundations for Animation and Illustration) is a one-year certificate program. \n\n\nI would suggest you talk to the Coordinators and explain what you want in the end. They would be the best people to help advise you.",

I won't find programming challenging but I'm just not a fan of it anymore (did a couple of years of game programming at a different college).  I'll try reaching out to the program coordinators then just to ask a few more questions.",

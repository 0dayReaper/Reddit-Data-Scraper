    "postText": "I will be starting the full time online Computer Programming program in a few weeks and was wondering how much the textbooks are actually used and/or if they are helpful. I did a year at UOttawa with a different program and found other than language workbooks, none of my courses really utilized the textbooks and it felt like a waste of money.\n\nHas anyone here taken this program and can give me some insight before I drop a few hundred dollars on these books?",

I'm going into my final term, and haven't purchased any other textbooks. \n\nMost of the other textbooks can be accessed for free through your Algonquin account anyway, via O'Reilly (I think).",

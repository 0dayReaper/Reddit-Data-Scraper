    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI will be starting my semester on the 13th as I\u2019m an online student, and I have no idea if I have to buy my book or if that comes with my tuition package for online students. \n\nAlso, in terms of exams, will I have the whole day to pick exam time or has a specific exam time like the campus learning? \n\nAny help, please?",

Check in your brightspace first, the teacher should have detailed instructions in 'Content'\n\nOther than that there is this link: \n\nhttps://www.bookstore.algonquincollege.com/getting-my-course-materials\n\nAlso side not for funding, make sure you log into you ACSIS and fill out a bursury application as it can help you make up the costs of books, essentially free money. You don't get it right away but it can help when it comes in.",

Usually the exam will be open to write for 2 weeks. Some facilitators will give you specific times and dates. Some courses will just have a final project for you to do instead of an exam. Either way, it's all online.",

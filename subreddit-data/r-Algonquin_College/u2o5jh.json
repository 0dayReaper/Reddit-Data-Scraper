If you hang around J316 you're bound to make buddies with other Game Dev students. Also if you want to meet people from other programs, I recommend you attend events at the AC Hub.\n\nAs far as BYOD, I would advise you to wait until classes start before buying anything. I bought a huge gaming laptop before starting the program and barely used it for the whole 3 years, maybe just when I did homework. The lab computers should be enough, and if anything get something to annotate in class (iPad or notepad, either works). \n\nOh, and a scientific calculator, nothing fancy just the regular Sharp or Casio, it really comes in handy. You'll be doing some math (in fact, everything in games is math, as you'll come to learn).",

Really appreciate it.\n\nI was hoping that as far as homework, my desktop could suffice (can run most modern games at low at the least, Halo Infinite being the first I straight up couldn't, so software should be fine?) but was definitely prepping to budget a beefy laptop.\n\nJ316, not sure what that is, however!",

J316 is the computer lab at the end of the hall. \n\nFor your home computer, as long as it can handle Unity and Unreal engine, you're fine. I will say though that you shouldn't expect to be doing a lot of gaming; you will be busy enough with programming and working on assignments, if you really want to excel in the program.\n\nIf you have other questions, let me know. I graduated from the program 3 years ago, so I can give you some insight if you need.",

I was on the AC Simulations Lab team in 2018, and we had our own private Discord server (set up by Dushan), separate from our class Discord.\n\nI think it's better for him to wait until he starts the program to join any of the official servers.",

I got a invite to an official one a few weeks before my first semester, and once we got in classes the student run server links started getting passed around.\n\nThere's one really big student server that has a lot of the profs on it too. I just asked the mods there if it's cool to invite future students I'll DM you a link if I don't get any objections.  \n\n\nEdit: oh and I'd hold off on the laptop purchasing. The Algonquin site makes it seem like a laptop is required but apparently our classrooms will have computers so it may not actually be the case. The other guy's calculator suggestion is a good call, the math class is being reworked but when I took it last year it was really old school, had to print out test sat home and scan them back into the computer to hand them in",

            "comment": "Prof for a different program, but I know students in CST.  Rule #1, stay away from Macs, especially the new M1/M2 macs.  You won't be able to run software you need for this class.\n\nEssentially you want:\n\n- i5 or i7 - Try for an H class processor and avoid G class processors.  11th or 12th gen if possible\n- 16GB of RAM\n- 500GB or 1TB SSD\n- Several USB 3.0 (or higher) ports.\n- 1080p display\n\nI strongly recommend the 1TB SSD drive.  Outside of these specs, the rest is minimal, but nice to haves such as:\n\n- HDMI port so you can hook up another display\n- actual ethernet jack otherwise you will be using a dongle at times",

You have to be careful with gaming laptops.  Heat management can be am issue.",

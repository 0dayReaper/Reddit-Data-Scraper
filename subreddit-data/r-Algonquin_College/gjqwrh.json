So, I was supposed to start the Computer programmer online diploma this spring but I decided to defer it to the fall start date due to personal issues. I would like to know what the experience has been like for those of you who started the program in May. What courses are they teaching you guys? And what are the chances of getting credits from previous college courses? Specifically for the Math course and the Technical writing course. \n\nStrata",

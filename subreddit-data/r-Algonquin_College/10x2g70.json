    "postText": "Hi, I applied to DMS and CMS but I\u2019m hoping to get into to DMS however not feeling very confident of my HPAT score as its 75.5% \nDoes anyone know if anyone from the previous years got in with anything under an 80% to competitive programs?\nI also had a 3.8 GPA in undergrad but feel like they dont take that into consideration.\nI\u2019m very nervous and anxious and waiting for offers to come out as I have put all my hopes for DMS. \nAlso can anyone who is already in the program give us a brief summary of how its going so far? Is it worth it in the long run?",

I also heard of students receiving \u201c you didn\u2019t get in\u201d emails right away if they didn\u2019t make the cut. So don\u2019t loose hope!",

It\u2019s a percentage of each category and it\u2019s based on rankings so there is no way to say that is your score.",

I thought with a bachelor of science I\u2019d be set, but it\u2019s a huge time commitment. I love it so much, but be prepared to be in class from 8am-8pm, coming in for weekends, and agreeing to do placement anywhere in Ontario.",

It's possible that 1 or 2 of them will take on 2 students. So I'd say 5 students for each semester get an Ottawa placement, so about 10 students overall between 3rd and 4th semester. Our class is about 24 people, so a bit less than half will get to stay in the city for 4 months.\n\nEven if you get Ottawa for one of the placements, it is a guarantee that the other placement will be elsewhere. There are some placements in southern Ontario, but keep in mind that the Toronto schools start to snag those spots up quicker than Algonquin can. Money talks, and Michener + private colleges will almost always get priority.\n\nBasically, do not expect to remain in Ottawa.",

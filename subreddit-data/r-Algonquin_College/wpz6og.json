Downstairs of Building C) During exam time it\u2019s best to book those rooms online bc they become filled very fast. U can also book classrooms if there is a larger group that would like to study. The doors are always open. I was there overnight once studying and there\u2019s always someone around (this was also pre panni but I\u2019m sure since most programs are back in person it will be the same and lots of people love to study at the college, very beautiful imo.",

Gym is open from 8-8 I believe and is only in X building.\n\nThings may reopen come September, but I don\u2019t have information on that.",

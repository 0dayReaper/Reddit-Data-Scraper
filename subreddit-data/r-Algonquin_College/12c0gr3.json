My program was from home for terms 1-3 and I already had a desktop at home. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t bother trying to use an Apple laptop for programming. Once they switched to their own chips from intel, mirroring windows became a lot more difficult. \n\nYes parallels exists, but it doesn\u2019t support all the software used. I would sell it and get a windows one.",

Second semester database will require windows or you will have some issues using oracle database with the new M1 architecture. \n\nSemester 3 networking the commands are not really transferable to Mac and a bit challenging finding the appropriate ones to pull subnet mask and configuration etc, and in java you will have issues with netbeans for an IDE so highly advisable to use windows.\nI was using a MacBook Pro M1 chip and had to end up purchasing a cheap windows device to complete most assignments in level 2 and level 3 even though I am running Parallels. The VM can only get you so far unfortunately.\n\nThis program is already challenging as it is, so don\u2019t make it more stressful for yourself like I did.",

Only things I straight up couldn\u2019t do was use some of the database programs in semester 2. \n\nThe stuff mentioned by others about networking commands are all doable you\u2019ll just have to figure it out yourself. If you\u2019re comfortable with Mac and its Unix based commands you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nOther than that, my M1 blows a lot of others processors out of the water. Especially when loading up the virtual device and running the apps on it for Mobile Programming.",

I want to hear about your thoughts on the Engineering degree offered at Algonquin and how it compares to an Engineering degree you can take at a university, and if it\u2019s worth taking for future jobs and co-op. I got accepted into CarletonU, but Algonquin is far cheaper and I wanna know if it\u2019s worth it. Thanks",

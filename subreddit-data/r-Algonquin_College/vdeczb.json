    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI'm a Carleton graduate seeking to do a program at Algonquin. I'm curious regarding their scheduling and course load. I have heard the work is a lot easier compared to Carleton. Therefore, I'd like to increase my course load. Is that something that's possible with Algonquin? Is a certain GPA required? Also, what is the limit and what are the due dates to do that? \n\nThanks!",

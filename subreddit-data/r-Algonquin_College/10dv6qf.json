    "postText": "Hey guys, i\u2019m a level 3 student at Algonquin. \n\nMy friend asked me to help him create a discord server dedicated for his new program as a level 1 student and I figured I could extend this to others that are interested. I have a nice server template to use as a starter if anyone wanted to create their very own. \n\nNot looking for any incentives, and i\u2019m willing to give the full ownership to whoever wants to bare that responsibility. \n\nI just figured that level 1 students deserve their very own community rather than mixed servers or overwhelming alumni servers for newcomers. Those are still good but my program benefited a lot from creating our very own. \n\nLet me know! \ud83d\udc4c",

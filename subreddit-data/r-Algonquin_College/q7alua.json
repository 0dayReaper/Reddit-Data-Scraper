    "postText": "Literally, our professor is doing nothing. She gave us a quiz last night. BUT, none of them was based on what we learnt or her content materials in Birghtspace.\n\nI spent the day studying for that 20 minutes quiz time. I watched her lectures' recordings, read slides, pdf files, assignment instructions, anything she posted on Brightspace. NOTHING was on that quiz. \n\nSince next week will be the midterm, I am very afraid of getting failure this course. I don't want to lose the Dean's Honour List. And next semester is coop term. If I fail this course, maybe I lose coop. \n\nI already emailed the professor and student success specialist. Any idea of an effective way to complain?\n\nThank you in advance.",

The SSW program at Algonquin is run by the worst most ridiculous person ever. \n\nMade me drop out and come back to take Programming so I\u2019m happy in a way. \n\nanyways, yea, point of the story is she made my time in the program so fucking hard for no reason. By the 3rd semester I was writing papers for people in class (in sick with papers what can I say). The two dudes I wrote papers for got A+s I shit you not and she gave me a D\n\nOne of my papers she said \u201cthere\u2019s no way you wrote it but I can\u2019t prove you plagiarized it so I\u2019m giving you a 51\u201d\n\nFuck I hate that bitch",

Class rep should set a 1-1meeting with the professor to voice students' concerns. If there is no change from the instructor, the issue can be escalated to the department chair. We had an experience with a subpar prof and this is the way that complaints get passed through the chain. The higher-ups won't even listen to your concern unless enough students voice their opinion.",

The prof used the excuse \"well it only took me 25min to complete\" (as if she didnt write the questions).the test results went unchanged and  the college promptly fired her (after completing the semester) as it was her only class and had 0 student satisfaction. Not to mention her making fun of ESL students accent while barely anyone could understand her accent, as well as her lecture being 100% W3schools.",

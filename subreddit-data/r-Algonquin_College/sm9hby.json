    "postText": "Hi! I am currently in my second semester of college, but I am in my first level of the program I'm in right now.\n\nAka, I did f21 and I am doing w22 right now. I am supposed to do s22, and then f22, looping back to w23. Then I will get a summer break and get to continue into f23 and graduating w24. \n\nSo pretty much I am supposed to go 5 semesters straight with only the 2ish weeks in between.  \n\nI am doing biotechnology advanced but I am feeling very worn out already as I have an anxiety disorder. I don't know if I am up to do another 3 semesters with out that summer break. \n\nAm I able to finish this semester (level one) and pick up the next level two intake in w23 instead? I am just feeling really worn out and can use the break. I mean who know, I might end up being okay and go through with the next 3 semester straight and then a break before yhe last two but I want to know my options as I am concerned with my mental health.\n\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "As other have said, if you need a break, take it. Mental health is crucial. I would just suggest you to talk to your Coordinator to get some guidance on what to do and to see what resources are available to help with both the break/return transition and for mental health. \n\nIt's still early but just so it's out there, March 18th is the last day to withdrawn without getting academic penalty for most programs.\n\nLastly, the College does have [Mental Health](https://www.algonquincollege.com/studentsupportservices/mental-health/) resources if you need them. Don't be afraid to reach out to them if you feel it necessary.",

Do meditation for your anxiety. Exercise. Get good sleep. Eat healthy. Return to school after a short break. Too long a break will be detrimental. Recharge. :)",

This has been a subject of many threads in this reddit ...\nprocrastination is the enemy!\n\nThe #1 issue is the volume of WORK compressed into a very short span of TIME (CP 2 years, CET 3 years). If you lose focus, it is extremely hard to recover. \n\nAlso, if you are in CO-OP, do everything in your power (!) to keep your GPA up so you stay in.\nCO-OP is the #1 advantage you will have when it comes to getting a job, many of my students\nget a job with their CO-OP employer ... and then can move around Ottawa or other cities",

You\u2019ll be working in groups for many of your courses, so it\u2019s key to find a group of people you can easily work with.",

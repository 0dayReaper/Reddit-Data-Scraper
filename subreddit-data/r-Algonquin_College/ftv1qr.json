    "postText": "We're *explicitly singled out* by the Trudeau Government to *not* apply for CERB benefits. From the [CERB website](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.htm):\n\n&gt; The Benefit is only available to individuals who stopped work as a result of reasons related to COVID-19. If you are looking for a job but haven\u2019t stopped working because of COVID-19, you are not eligible for the Benefit.   \n\n&gt;For example if you are a student who had a job last year and were planning on working this summer you do not qualify for the benefit.\n\nThat means if you had a co-op offer rescinded, you don't apply. If you're graduating, you don't apply.\n\nWe're being left behind by the Government. We're failing not just ourselves, but our peers, if we don't do everything in our power to make our voices heard. \n\nI implore all of you to contact your MP and let them know you won't forget being left behind in the greatest crisis we will likely face in our lifetimes.\n\nIf you live around Algonquin College, your MP is [Anita Vandenbeld](https://www.anitamp.ca/) (Ottawa West-Nepean). Otherwise, [use this site to find your MP](https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en). Contact them any way you can. They're obviously not doing face-to-face meetings anymore, but you can still call them or e-mail them. Let them know your situation. Let them know you need these benefits. Let them know that we're a generation of students who will not forget the actions of the government during these times.",

            "comment": "From my understanding agreements for nursing are 3.3 overall GPA but you need either the 3.3 or 3 OR the HPAT eligibility (over the minimum acceptance for the application section) to get in. You won\u2019t get in without them. If you finished Pre Health or whatever you should be okay on your HPAT. If not, I\u2019d take the semester off and study, you\u2019ll do fine! Best of luck \n- Nursing Grad",

Understand why it does what it does. \nWhen you get code on tests you should be able to tell what the expected output will be.\n\nThings like local variables, global variables, constructors.",

I'm the mean time you can go here: https://www.algonquincollege.com/slc/ for self help. They will direct you here but to particular areas. The college has a bunch of resources from Tutors to Time Management sessions/modules and to Counselling. You need to figure out what works best for you. \n\nAlso TALK TO YOUR PROFESSOR AND ASK QUESTIONS. I hope I was able to stress that comment above. \n\nAssuming anything is the same as not knowing. If you are not willing to put a month's pay down then you don't know the answer. Asking does not make you lose marks it only ensures you get every mark possible. Plus by asking you build a report with the professor and that will lead to more understanding when and if you need more time for example. Also it leads to them being more generous when it comes to marking not because they like but because they will realize where you were coming from  even though your answer is wrong. Part marks are a beautiful thing. \n\nI can go on and on but you have a whole department wanting you to graduate and be a star. If you don't believe me think of it from the college point of view. You succeeding means they trained you well. You moving up the ranks means \"Algonquin Graduates\" are amazing to employ. That leads to people either talking about Algonquin (advertising) and it ensures people come study at the college. Which means more money. The beautiful thing is the Professors and Support staff that want you to succeed don't care about the above. They care about you. It actually brings them joy to see the people they teach and help succeed. So, regardless the help you get is back by motivation. They can't write the test for you but they will sure help make sure you have the pen and paper to ace it. \n\nI really hope you get my point....ask for help, ask questions, and graduating is easier than you think.",

    "postText": "Hello everybody. I recently applied to the ADMH program and got a conditional offer (I still didn't finish my bachelor's fully). \n\nThe thing is, I don't see many postings about this program. Aside from students asking who else may be taking it. Or if I do, they seem outdated. \n\nSo, does anyone here have experience taking that program or know anybody who has? Was it actually worth their time? \n\nMaybe I should give some background, but I have a bachelors in psychology (BA Hons). I'm not really feeling research much, so I decided I wanted to do something regarding helping people with mental health issues. I was thinking of pursuing a MSW, but those programs require a minimum of 1000 hours of human service experience. So, I felt this degree was my next best bet to get started somewhere.\n\nThanks for reading my post :).",

            "comment": "As likely one of the only people to attend both:\n\nBI has more difficult labs, and the prof is very picky about what they want. Full lab report style, often trying to figure out what the requirements are or finding specific deliverables buried in the content.\n\nCOBOLs labs are almost entirely code or diagrams. You can adjust the code (that you should be writing in class) to fulfill the labs and midterm).\n\nBoth have quizzes that are straightforward if youve listened to the professor. COBOL you need to do the extra work in, BI you need to put in exactly the work the professor wants.\n\nIf you can get Jason for your COBOL lab prof, he's probably the best at showing you what to do.\n\nHesham the COBOL lecturer has a lot of content and can be difficult to understand. Sit close to the front to follow, don't get distracted.\n\nBI lecturer / lab prof Anu likes to call out people for being unprepared. Refresh your stats knowledge or you'll flounder.",

Actually it was one of the smoothest courses I took - well paced and the material had a fair bit of context. A bit of googling required for deeper dives but otherwise fine.",

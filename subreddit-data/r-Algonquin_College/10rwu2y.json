They asked that we make this decision before moving on to the next section of the exam eg. before starting the entire science section. You could never go back and revisit a question at any time. \n\nNot sure if that\u2019s helpful? Just my experience. Good luck!",

For example, if your OCAS number starts with \u201c16\u201d, you can only write the AC-HPAT\u2122 once for programs beginning in 2016 (or Jan. 2017).\n\n\nHope this helps, good luck on the testing-hope you do well!",

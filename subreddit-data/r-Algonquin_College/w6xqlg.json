I can guarantee that it will cause you no end of grief in this program.\n\nEssentially, what you need is:\n\n- i5 or i7 10th gen or newer.  Anything less will be laggy AF.\n- 16GB of RAM.  In level 2, you will be using VMWare, Oracle, MS-SQL Server.  Any one of these will be painful on 8GB.  However, you will have all 3 installed at the same time. I am not 100% but in one of the later level, you may be using Android Studio.  There is a reason that there are memes about it.  It makes your RAM go Brrrrrrrrrr.\n- 500GB HDD.  This is on the small side considering everything you need to install.  If you decide to cheap out here, you will likely need to get some additional storage.  The Crucial X6 or X8 (depends on the age and specs of the laptop) are excellent external solutions\n\nAlso, some of the software you will be using throughout the program are CPU and RAM hogs.",

You\u2019ll have to download emulators for the android course and they take up space as well as the level 4 virtual machine you\u2019ll install dockers on. Also as mentioned, go with a good cpu and decent RAM (at least 16GB) and don\u2019t worry about a GPU as there nothing dependent on it.",

If one could install these programs(VMWARE, Android studio, oracle,mysql/ms-sql) in Ubuntu, are they going to run into issues while attending the program. Or should they install windows on their XPS13 9310, 16GB RAM, 500GB ssd, i7. And Linux on their 500GB external SSD SanDisk extreme just to test things just in case there are some issues.\n\nAsking this because I will be attending the program in January. And thanks in advance \ud83d\ude0a",

The wireless network is weird AF and it's doors something screwy with its certificates.",

How is this fair? I'm drowning in work and feel so anxious about it I can't even look at LMS. Anyone else facing similar struggles?",

            "comment": "Hey! Honestly I have had the same issue. I couldn't keep up so I went down from 7 to 4 course. Made things alot better. I wasn't as stressed and didn't feel as burnt out. you can drop down to 60% course load or 40% if you are a student with permanent disability (this includes things such as learning disabilities, mental health conditions, physical disabilities, etc. Speak to CAL if you are uncertain if you qualify for 40%). \n\nI ended up going back to full time this semester in a new program. BIG MISTAKE. Not everyone will find its too much full time but most people I've talk to do. Don't feel bad at all. I'd say you're in the majority. Truth is, even tho I was \"getting through\" with a full load, it was and it isn't worth it. I wasn't absorbing what I was learning and I ended up hating school and my program. \n\n\nIf you think you might want to do this, you can talk to your academic advisor, your program coordinators, and/or CAL. \n\nTruth is college brings its own set of challenges even though it's treated as a lesser of university. Managing 6-8 courses that leave you with 5-8 assignments isn't fair, you are right. Sadly that's how it goes though. It's incredibly hard but if you want to well in your program and feel like you aren't overwhelmed, youit to your studies and your mental health to do what works best for you! \n\nI hope this helps, but feel free to dm for any questions or ask in the comments. \n\nI hope everything goes well and know you aren't alone in this!",

Different experiences, but while at uOttawa a normal full-time student was taking five, maybe four, and the go-getters and engineers were taking 6-7.\n\nSome courses have mandatory lab sections, discussion groups, etc. on top of lectures.\n\nIn all fairness, other people's highlights aren't fair to compare with your every day.\n\nIf you need help with anything school minded, we've got a bunch of resources to help you figure out what's best for you.",

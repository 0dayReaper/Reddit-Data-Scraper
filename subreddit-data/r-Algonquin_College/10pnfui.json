According to their information on competitive programs, they take a variety of criteria into consideration when determining who gets a seat in the program. A lot of people say it\u2019s only based on the HPAT score, but I think this is misinformation as they take over two weeks to rank applicants. If it was simply a matter of HPAT scores, the ranking process wouldn\u2019t take that long.",

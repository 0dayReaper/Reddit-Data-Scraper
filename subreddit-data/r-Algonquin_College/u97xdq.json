Mostly when you use that port as a direct network adapter for your VMs. I would hate coming into the lab early morning to find out that I forgot my adapter",

I highly recommend getting a device with windows os on it. You will need something with at least 16 GB of ram, at least 256 for storage(1TB would be Ideal) or have a large external drive works too. Plus a internet port with be key to have. \n\nAs well if you are also looking for more insight on the CST program. Especially with regard to how to survive this program textbook, device specification and additional help. There is an official discord server for the program filled to the brim with current students, alumni and helpful professors.\n\nIf you wish to join the Server, send me a message and I will provide the link.\n\nHope this answer your questions and shoot me a message if you have more. \n\nThanks \nLargeSmiles",

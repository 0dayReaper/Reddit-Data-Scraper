People are more likely to add their names to the petitions if you don't make ridiculous statements like this one.  Your professors are doing more than you know to accommodate you at this difficult time - trust me.  There is no rational reason to make an exam \"more difficult.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: the comment I was originally referring to has since been removed from the petition.  This is good.

Many of the students in my program area have \"reported\" professors only to be rebutted with excuses as \"that's not my problem\", \"you're just complaining\", \"you just want things easier\", and so on.  In the last 3 years students in my program area have had to deal with chronic absenteeism from professors, professors caught bragging about their high failure rates, professors that lash out irrationally when asked to have their grading conform to the Course Outline, professors that demean and humiliate students in front of the class.. and I could go on.\n\nSo please, spare us.  If we could \"report\" that professor, we would.  Petitions are a symptom of desperation, and we don't exactly have a lot of time to go through the College's ponderous complaints process.  It really burns my ass that I have to keep explaining to pedagogues that we are not children, we generally aren't interested in avoiding learning, and that we just want to make sure we don't get screwed over *yet again*.",

UOttawa allows students to choose to take the Satisfactory grade before exams are written, which in my opinion, is the fair way to do it.

If they aren't able to fulfill that obligation (even if it's completely out of their control, as it is) then they need to be willing to compromise on the standards in which the school grades their students. Algonquin is no different.\n\nAt this point all it does is save you from destroying your GPA, or getting put on academic probation should you fail.

If a student chooses not to opt-in for this, then they will receive a letter grade. The purpose of this is to aid the many students who like yourself, have a 4.0 but may be adversely affected by the current situations. Not everyone is fortunate, and many people have lost their source of income and/or have been afflicted with COVID-19 or their loved ones have.

This is not about privilege, and no one is trying to discredit or invalidate anyone's work. You are missing the point. This is OPTIONAL. If you want to keep the letter grade, you get to keep it along with your hard work. I prefer a letter grade as well, and yet I signed the petition. Why? Because what others receive grade-wise will not invalidate my efforts, because others receiving a pass/fail will not affect my grade. What it will do though is help many of students who are still struggling nonetheless, even with current academic accommodations (which I will say have been all over the place and not consistent. I sympathize with most professors nonetheless).",

I have mental illnesses that I've worked my ass off to manage properly and I've done it well enough to go through school so far with such high grades, but I can not deal with current conditions\n\nReaching out to the school for help has resulted in no action and just further stress. I've never had good experiences with the school's \"accessibility\" services. I don't want my current situation to leave its impact on my grades.\n\nOptional pass/fail won't hurt your GPA at all. Show some compassion to those of us who are having trouble.",

Have you spoken to your instructors individually, been open about what you're struggling with and told them exactly what you need? (Altered assignment expectations, longer deadlines?) Because that's what getting help looks like. It isn't saying, hey, this is fucked, change it. It's making a plan together that works for you. \n\nAlso the city has some awesome mental health resources you should tap into if you haven't already.",

I'm emailed teachers directly and I've been ignored. I've had very bad experiences with dealing with CAL to date. I've tried. I don't want to say that the professors don't care, because I know they're dealing with a lot, but I want to emphasize that what you're saying is easy is not working for me at all. I've been ignored and I don't have the spoons to keep trying to reach out.\n\nBut that's not the point. The point is that again, pass/fail is OPTIONAL and good for you that you are obviously doing well enough to still be able to focus on school. Good for you! But there's literally no reason to deny the help for everyone else who needs it",

If you start to level out and have the energy I would bring it to the program chair or ombudsman because being ignored in this time is inappropriate of them. \n\nAlso, the only reason I'm holding on to school stuff is because that's all I can control so I'm controlling it obsessively and compulsively. I just swung the opposite direction. Sleep for 13 hours, school for 10, cry for 1. Good healthy routine.",

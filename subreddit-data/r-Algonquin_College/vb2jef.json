    "postText": "Hey, I am planning on buying a new laptop for my start of college in September and am wondering what size I should go for. \n\nI will be enrolling in the computer engineering tech program. I have read the system requirements for the program and they only specify \u201c12 inch screen or larger\u201d I\u2019ve never even seen a 12 inch laptop screen lol. Anyways\u2026 I thought it would be more useful to ask the Algonquin student community. \n\nAlso if you have any other advice regarding buying a laptop for college I would love to hear it. :D",

If the laptop can fit in your bag, then size isn't an issue, if the laptop adds so much weight that it's uncomfortable to carry around, then you have a problem.\n\nThat being said, 14\" will be more than enough, maybe get a second monitor for your residence/home desk.",

    "postText": "i\u2019ve been super confused on acceptances and just general information there\u2019s NO INFORMATION being shared, i\u2019ve been trying to connect with people who have applied as well, so here\u2019s what I have learnt today, I hope this can help some people: \n\n*AND NO I HAVEN\u2019T RECEIVED AN ACCEPTANCE YET*\n\nalso if you know anymore information pls share :)!\n\n\n1) \nthere are only 58 people actually accepted into the program \n\n2)\nif you got the email that said acceptances are coming out march 1st, apparently that\u2019s changed. I know of 4 people who got acceptances today (February 17) and they were both deans list pre-health students (they got early acceptance). TURNS OUT ACCEPTANCES START TMR FEBRUARY 18TH\n\n3)\nmake sure your calculating your hpat score properly, to get your proper score each of your 4 categories is out of 300 (I KNOW ITS OUT OF 8, 300, 300, &amp; 60) the highest score you can get is 1200: (4 X 300 = 1200) \nstudents closest too 1200, get offers \n\n4)\njust because 1000 + people applied doesn\u2019t mean your competing with 1000 people that\u2019s just the number of people who APPLIED it may not be their first choice either, there\u2019s also a lot of people who didn\u2019t write the hpat or were missing requirements. so the number of people may be a lot smaller than you think (still a lot of ppl though) \n\n5)\nif you completed your hpat, application, and got all your requirements in on time you have a huge advantage to others you\u2019ll be considered first. \n\n6)\nif you took advanced pre-health check your first semester grades and see if you are over the GPA needed for algonquins agreement with competitive programs (for dental is 2.70 GPA MINIMUM) \n\n7)\nif you don\u2019t think you will be considered and don\u2019t wanna take dental assisting, APPLY TO CAMBRIAN (sudbury) AND CANADORE (north bay), they are SUPER easy to get into, it\u2019s not too late and it\u2019s a really good other option to consider if you\u2019re worried!!",

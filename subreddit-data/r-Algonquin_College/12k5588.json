While there is a balance between addictions and mental health, I honestly remember more about addictions than mental health but that could be because I work in the addictions field. Overall I do not regret it.",

As for job prospects, the company I want to work for has a job posting right now that if I had this certification I could get. It\u2019s an addictions counsellor at a treatment centre in northern BC (where I live). I\u2019m planning on eventually getting my masters in counselling but want to get some really good experience under my belt beforehand. \n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to get into mental health I seriously don\u2019t think it\u2019ll hurt to have it. I chose this program over Dalhousie because it has a practicum/placement.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; The prime minister also announced the federal government is doubling student grants for eligible students - up to $6,000 for full-time students and up to $3,600 for part-time students.\n\n&gt; &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re glad the government is turning its focus to helping students, but another complicated system is not what students need. Make the CERB universal so that no one gets left behind and so that students - and anyone else who needs help - can get $2,000 right away,&amp;quot; he tweeted.\n\n&gt; The Canadian Alliance of Student Associations and the Quebec Student Union said the package will bring &amp;quot;Significant relief&amp;quot; to students affected by the pandemic.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/g673kx/trudeau_to_announce_financial_aid_for_students/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~479886 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **student**^#1 **job**^#2 **government**^#3 **COVID-19**^#4 **Trudeau**^#5",

I wanted to get the word out there about our graduate student run Google Classroom filled with textbooks for the program, student made Quizlets, cheat sheets, notes, breakdowns, video skills and much more. This is open to all campus students but run by Ottawa specific students, but the owner did attempt Pembroke campus for PHS before!\n\nThere are currently two classrooms one for level 1/2 and another for levels 3/4/consolidation! If you\u2019re apart of the program or have confirmed admission and would like to join, feel free to PM me and I\u2019ll add you in.",

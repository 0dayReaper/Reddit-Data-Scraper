            "comment": "I just completed the program, however it's been updated with new courses since I joined years ago.\n\nThe workload is pretty straightforward for each course I took. I ran into some trouble with Bookkeeping, but the facilitator for that course can help you and walk you through things if need be. For the most part though, they'll ask you to do 1 - 2 things a week, maybe earlier if you choose to work ahead. My advice, work ahead just in case you run into any trouble and need extra time and help.\n\nAlso be advised that if there's still a course called Interpersonal Relations, the facilitator for that course may lack some serious interpersonal skills. I'm talking not responding to emails, being very vague and delivering half assed instructions and answers when she does email you back.\n\nI got out of each course with an A - A+ and I never really used the textbooks, though what works for me, may not work for you.\n\nDM me if you have any questions and good luck.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI really need your help. I got an offer to a program that starts in January 2023 at Algonquin, and I am supper ecstatic about it. But upon reading the email today, it stated the deadline to \"secure\" the offer of admission is in a few days, which is October 14. I feel like that is not enough time for me to decide where I want to go yet, and was hoping they would at least give me the courtesy to decide by November. I have applied for other programs at Algonquin too and kind of want to wait and see what I really wanna do.\n\nMy question is, if the offer isn't accepted by that date, will the offer expire and I can no longer be a part of the program? Or can I still accept it past the date? They are really rushing the decision lol.\n\nThank you so much!",

There are also different levels of certification, so make sure you sign up for the right one for your program! You can do them with red cross or St John's Ambulance ( I highly recommend red cross )",

They do not accept any kinds of \u201conline\u201d versions of CPR. I\u2019d email algonquin and check with them but I\u2019m pretty positive they don\u2019t accept that, the learning and practicing must be done in person.",

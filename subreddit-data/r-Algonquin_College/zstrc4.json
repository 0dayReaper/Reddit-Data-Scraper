If there are 100 seats in the program and 150 people score higher than you, then you will be placed as #51 on the waiting list. The first 100 get in, and the next 50 get the higher priority on the waitlist.\n\nIt really depends on how many people are applying (more people applying = more competition), and how many seats there are (fewer seats = more competition). It's hard to tell if a score is good enough to get in, as it depends on factors that are hard to predict.",

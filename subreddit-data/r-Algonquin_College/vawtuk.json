The prof doesn\u2019t expect much and it\u2019s good to raise your average mark.\n\nI\u2019d say though that some of your choices are much more interesting. Choose what interests you or think it could advance your future career, as this is the chance to do it.",

I figured it would be difficult though, since I got the impression that there was a creative writing assignment and that is not my forte. Is it mainly reading and analyzing? Because I'm totally down for that kind of work.\n\nEdit to add: thanks for taking the time to respond, btw! Much appreciated.",

If anyone has experience with any of these particular electives I would appreciate some insight into what can be expected (and whether or not I should be avoiding a particular course).\n\nThanks in advance!",

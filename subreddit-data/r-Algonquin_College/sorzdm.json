I am pretty sure acceptances come out after February (so march 1st) at least that's what was told to me via email from the school. I am VERY nervous if acceptances go out tmr. \n\nI have heard many mixed reviews as far as acceptances for Dental Hygiene, I am currently in advanced pre-health at Algonquin, and my GPA was only a little higher of the minimum for Algonquins \"agreement\" with the dental hygiene program. I didn't do as well as I thought I would on the AC-HPAT but I didn't fail.  \n\nBut I got an acceptance letter today for another school, but I really wanna stay at Algonquin. \n\nLet me know if you guys get in, I wish you all the best of luck and hope we all get in :)))",

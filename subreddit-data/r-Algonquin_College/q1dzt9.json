Some of these professors are an absolute joke (few are awesome) and the college seems to not like to take criticism at all. I feel like our course and professor ratings fall on deaf ears as well. \n\nHuge contrast from my first program in 2013 to now.",

            "comment": "Holy cow. I am also in 3rd semester of computer programming (online) and I have become completely disillusioned in the program. \n\nThe first two semesters were...fine. There was only one class that was a nightmare, Database Systems. A lot of the classes were a joke. My favorite example is one of my classmates submitting the rough draft of their final essay in technical writing and getting an A. I also completely phoned in my final essay and got perfect. The program is a complete fucking joke 60% of the time. I got the same mark as the poor bastards who actually took the essay seriously.\n\nAt this point, I thought the program wasn't as bad as I'd read. I could see myself recommending it to others despite being a joke sometimes.\n\nNOT ANYMORE. I don't recommend this program to ANYONE. They hide how shit this program is until the 3rd semester. \n\nThe OOP class isn't even trying to teach you. It's purely evaluation. The assignments are very vague and confusing. The teacher refuses to clarify anything. Because again, he's literally not trying to teach you how to do the assignments. The class has 4 textbooks, he will tell you to go read them. Everyone in your class who is new to programming will be as lost as you are. But there will be a handful of students who are already java professionals just there for the diploma, who will be condescending dicks about how they find it sooo easy and understandable. You'll have people recommending to you that you team up with other students who know what they're doing. In other words, your only chance at passing is having someone else piggy back you through the course. Fuck that, I'm not going to make some other poor fuck drag me through the course.\n\nThats one class! Mobile is just as bad! The labs are long, difficult and confusing. At least I can complete these labs, so it has that going for it. But the teacher doesn't give part marks. It's purely binary. If you didn't complete a section because of an error you documented, he doesn't give a fuck. 0 marks. He doesn't even pretend to give a shit. He says himself, there are too many students in the course for him to be able to spend time taking a second look at a lab. That's right, if you forget to submit something (which is easy to do, the submission rules are confusing if you've never used github) hes not going to look twice. You get a zero.\n\nDo you know how terrible it feels to spend 4 hours doing a lab, and getting a fucking D because you couldn't fix the errors you were getting? Some dickhead facilitator who clearly is just scanning your submission, checking off the rubric as fast as he can so he can finish his marking as soon as possible.",

I agree that database was kind of trash. \n\nI couldn\u2019t recommend it to anybody either at this point to be honest. \n\nOOP was great in first semester but second and third it\u2019s a joke. Yeaaahhh for mobile the labs are awful. Poor instructions and shit, way more complicated than they need to be.",

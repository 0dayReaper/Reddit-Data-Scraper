My advice is the moment you had your acceptance letter for your program you should have registered for Fswep as it goes per season. For example: if you wanted a position for January you application should have been submitted for September but sometimes the departments delay and you might be selected in January for a term meaning four months. I have experienced if you do good with the department they tend to keep renewing your contract.",

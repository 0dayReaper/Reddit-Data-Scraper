    "postText": "hey guys i\u2019m planning on applying to algonquin but i really don\u2019t know what to do in the future for a career, i\u2019ve been out of hs for almost a year and a half. I tried applying to dental hygiene but didn\u2019t do as good as i wanted to on the AC-HPAT exam in January 2021. I know I want to do something in the medical/dental field or maybe even government but that still earns a decent pay. How long is the waitlist for the programs and how does it work? i literally feel like i\u2019m running out of time and stressing myself out way too much about what to do, if you can give me any advice or information on some programs or your personal experiences with different programs i\u2019d really appreciate it a lot :)",

It's a well paying field with virtually a 100% chance of finding work immediately after graduation/registration. But if it's not something you actually want to do, the RMT program also has a (online) degree bridging arrangement with Thompson River University which allows you to get a bachelor of science in 1 year by transferring credits from Algonquin.",

But they prepare you very very well for what you'll encounter in practice, and in my professional life I've absolutely never felt like something I should have known wasn't taught. My number one tip would be to really really focus on learning the muscles. Mainly the attachments/origins/actions. It's really tedious, but you NEED to know them both in school and in practice. I used to sit for hours every day just memorizing the muscles. They will get drilled into you throughout the entire program, but if you neglect them you are screwed.\n\nAs an aside, there were definitely a few times in school where we felt learning X was overkill and useless because it's so obscure that we'd never actually see it in practice. I can tell you this ended up being 1000% false, because I definitely have ended up seeing clients with the exact conditions I would complain about in school. Post-polio syndrome is one that I complained about in school, and when I ended up with a client who walked through my clinic doors with that condition, I sent a mental apology back to the instructors at Algonquin College. The people running the program there know their stuff and do a fantastic job.",

This program gives you a better shot at getting into the competitive programs and you also learn about other fields as well. If you do well in pre health you can be exempted from your HPAT score. Also do not worry that you are a year and a half out of high school, you have your whole life to work!",

It only applies to the current semester.\nOften people will back out when the semester gets close. When they do people from the wait list are offered those empty spots.\nYou can still apply for the following semester start while being on a wait list for the current one (if the program has multiple intakes per year).\nThe Registrar's office might be able to tell you your position on the waitlist. That might help you decide what to do.",

I wouldn't want to do hospital nursing long term because they're overworked and stressed all the time but you can do public health nursing or even nursing in government positions (i.e. occupational health nurses etc.) which are basically office jobs and steady hours so its a lot of different paths you can go down. Other programs are so specific that once you're in it you don't have a lot of options if you've finished and don't like it.",

            "comment": "As someone who's been at Algonquin for a long time, I'd be more than happy to share my wisdom about my time served there.\n\nLike you I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life. I tried TV Broadcasting which was my dream program found it to be too stressful and overwhelming so I dropped out. Then I tried computer programming and dropped out of that because I wasn't happy there. Then I enrolled in the Office Admin Program because the courses are very straightforward and basic and it offers a massive career field. Every job area requires office workers in some form or another. There's also a health care Office Admin program if you're looking to peruse that area.\n\nNow I'm a part-time online student. I take 1 - 2 courses a semester because it takes some of the pressure off  and allows me more time to get things done. I'm not sure how the full-time on campus program differs from the online version, but I imagine it's not that different.\n\nAlgonquin's Online division has programs that are open monthly both full-time and part-time and they have a wide variety of program options.\n\nI'd also like to offer some advise. If you're someone who's anxious or can't handle high pressure situations like me, don't depend on Algonquin's counselling services for help. They're basically a glorified information desk. Seek outside help for mental health that's not connected to Algonquin. I also wouldn't put a lot of trust into the Profs. Each Prof is different. Some are good, some just don't give a shit and are looking to just get paid. Also expect disappointment or under delivery from Algonquin, that's been my experience. I'd also like to remind you that you are not only a student, but also a customer seeking services Algonquin College and the customer is always right\n\nI know it sounds like I'm describing Algonquin in a negative light, but when you've been here as long as I have, you tend to see things in a different light. I hope this helps you, good luck (and I seriously mean it) with you studies.",

But now my stage shows \"Cancelled\" yet when I click on Pay Fee - I can access it. \n\nSo - if I pay my application fees in this application - will my application be submitted? Or do I need to start a new application?   \n\n\nPlease Help. \n\n[Reference](https://preview.redd.it/zufzpxm4aui91.jpg?width=1469&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7c1af6a54ad03e8d77bd3d3b3f2a58e364e2e423)",

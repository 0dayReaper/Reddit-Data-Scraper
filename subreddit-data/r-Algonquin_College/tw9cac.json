    "postText": "HI, i will be starting pre health advanced diplomas and degrees in May 9th and had a few questions for those that have taken it/currently in it. Firstly, is it worth it? The whole reason of why i'm taking its so that I can bridge into RN right away, and ive read any threads that say its a waste of time or just highschool programs. What level of difficulty are the programs, and can you balance it with work (20-25h a week per say)? I would appreciate any help on this matter as many threads have got me anxious lol.",

            "comment": "I am graduating the program in a couple of weeks, I can't tell you if it's worth it or not because it really does depend. \n\nPeople usually take pre-health to get a spot in competitive programs mainly competitive programs at Algonquin. Algonquin has agreements with advanced students in the pre-health program (yes, only advanced student qualify) that some students can qualify for an articulation agreement. \n\nArticulation agreements range for different programs. For example, the RPN program this year had unlimited seats available for students who apply they just had to finish first semester with over a 2.70 GPA and second semester with a 3.0, whereas respiratory therapy there was only one seat saved. So it REALLY ranges in competitiveness between programs, for BScN with Uottawa its just a 65% in all classes advanced pre-health classes, which is fairly easy. However some other programs require completion of the AC-HPAT (this isn't the case for BSN) if you're on the waiting list for a competitive program the articulation agreement may save a seat for you depending on the number of seats available that year, you qualified for an agreement and if you have the highest GPA. \n\nI would say it is worth it, a lot of competitive programs value the fact students applying have received higher education before applying but it ranges, in my opinion I wanted experience in post secondary before I picked a program. Everyones experience is different so I can't call it easy or hard, I've seen amazing students fail in a matter of weeks just because they fell behind. I have 2 people in just one of my classes who are UoG and UoT alumni, international students, mature students and students right out of high-school so it really does range in intelligence, it's a big mix of people. \n\nI was working around 30 hours then cut back to 20, then to 10, then I had to stop working but again thats just my experience, I also know people who have continued to work 30 hours a week. I will say though my grades improved the moment I stopped working. \n\nAs far as pre-health being high-school level, different places have different curriculum, so some may have seen stuff from high school others haven't. This can also range if you took C or U level classes in high-school. \n\nIf you have any other questions let me know. Good luck and don't stress you will do fine!",

I believe people who have taken advanced pre-med do 9-25 points higher on average further on in their education than high school students.",

Pre Health is high school classes you\u2019re paying x10 the price for so the content is the same as high school just a little more in depth, for me it was a waste of time and not worth the money. \n\nI choose an alternative route to getting my BScN, I am graduating from the RPN program in 6 weeks and then finishing my BScN fully online within the next two years!",

Did you graduate from Pre health and then go into RPN? or just dropped out and reapplied? the whole reason of why I'm taking pre health is also because i didn't do very good in highschool so I couldn't just apply straight away into nursing or RPN",

                            "comment": "I almost fully completed PHS before applying to RPN. I ended up not graduating because I dropped a class in semester two. The BScN program is super competitive to bridge into the PHS, and I wasn\u2019t confident in my ability to meet the grades needed (3.3 minimum GPA two years ago, idk about now!) So i did RPN and am doing my BScN online! \n\nMy only suggestion, if you want to do it cheaper and not do a full year of school, check out ILC. ILC is an awesome online high school for anyone in Ontario to take High School credits, get a diploma or do academic upgrading. I took some to help with admissions as well. They\u2019re only $40 per class instead of $3000 for the whole program. Classes are fully online, work at your own pace. I really enjoyed them!",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm graduating pre-health this semester. I have been out of highschool for years so I got a lot out of the program. I started out working 7-16 hrs/week and had to cut down to 0-1 days/month to keep on top of school. Think of your program like a full-time job- you'll need to put 35+ hours in per week to do well.\n\nIf your high school grades are good and you only need a couple of the credits to get into uni, definitely look into ILC and St Nicholas adult high school. Last semester we were told that even if you finish the advanced stream, you need a GPA of like 3.6+ to get into BScN at uOttawa because it's very competitive.\n\nI had planned to finish Advanced, but switched to Standard because I wasn't sure if I could keep my GPA high enough to get into BScN. I've been accepted into RPN at Algonquin and plan to bridge into BScN.",

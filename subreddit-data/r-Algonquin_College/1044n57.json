    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am interested in applying to the Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees program that is offered at Algonquin College. \nI have attended CEGEP and University in the past, but I did not complete my degree at both institutions. \nWhen I was attending CEGEP, I completed the equivalency of grade 12 English and grade 11 Math. Which are the only pre-reps for this class. \nWith all of this being said, do I need to include all of my past transcripts or will the transcripts with the pre-reqs (highschool and CEGEP) suffice?",

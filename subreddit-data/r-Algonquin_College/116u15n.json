    "postText": "Hi!:) I\u2019m interested in applying for Algonquin\u2019s Animation program. I\u2019m seeing on the website that the portfolio to get in is mostly, if not all, done traditionally(pencil and paper). I was wondering if that is the most recent requirements or have they changed the requirements to mostly digital now? Additionally, I\u2019m wondering if the portfolio requirements change every year or stay the same?",

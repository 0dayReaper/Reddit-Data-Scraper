When I was going, there was quite a bit of us and it can be difficult to get that personal help if you need it. At least in my experience.\n\nBetween clinical placements, labs, classes etc. All being delivered in difference ways, it can be easy to become overwhelmed.\n\nAs for employment, you won't have an issue. Nurses are still in high need.",

Placement issues, unfairness in placement \u201crandomization.\u201d Profs and clinical instructors don\u2019t get information until last second. \n\nClasses are difficult and program is a lot but good worth it. They\u2019ve gotten better with getting help and a lot of us older students have made it our mission to make it easier for students. (Ex one girl runs a full Google classroom with resources and textbooks and notes for students, others volunteer as tutors etc!)\n\nNo issues finding a job. They\u2019re pumping nurses out like wild.",

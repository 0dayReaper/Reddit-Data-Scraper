Maybe we can put something in the sidebar explaining that the W means Woodroffe campus and the second letter is the actual building? I remember wondering the same thing when I got my first timetable and apparently it hasn't been made any clearer since then.",

If those campuses had the same naming system, the \"A\" buildings would have to be \"PemA\" and \"PerA\" respectively. There must be a better way...",

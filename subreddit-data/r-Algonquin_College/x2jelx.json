    "postText": "Hello, I'm going on campus starting Sept and bussing is about a an hour and a half bus ride so I'm thinking of buying a parking pass either in red or green lot but the price difference is holding me back from making a decision even though red lot is closer to buildings. For those who have or have had a parking pass in either lot, what are your experiences, which one is worth the money and when do the lots usually fill up? Thanks in advance :)",

            "comment": "I would recommend going with the cheaper option, lot 9 I believe. You will be walking all over regardless so take the walking factor out of the equation, unless you are unable to walk those distances. During winter you can stay indoors all the way down to lot 9 and then take a short walk to your car.\n\nIf you get lot 8 you will be a closer parking spot and walk less, that's it. If you think the price difference is worth the luxury of a shorter walk then go to lot 8.  \n\nI hope I helped your decision making. Goodluck!",

I've had to drive around for 10-15 minutes just to find a spot.  I've also had to give up and park in Lot 12 instead (super far away) because I didn't want to be late for class.",

They decreased the size of the red lot recently to build the new ARC building so I'm sure red fills up too.  \n\nThis is my first year buying red parking and I am hoping to not have to drive around like I used to for green.. we will see!  At least after the driving around I'll be closer and won't have to walk 5 minutes just to get out of the parking lot XD",

There is a parking lot behind the bus station that sells monthly parking passes for about $100 per month. But it can be a bit of a walk depending on where your classes are.",

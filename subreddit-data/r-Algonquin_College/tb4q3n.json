    "postText": "Hey there! I have an Available room at The Revalie Ottawa in Brookfield Road (very close to Billings Bridge centre) at the price of 1349$ per month! (Available until August 2022 and contract renewable). The current market price of the apartment is actually higher (1700 $) so you are getting a great discount! All amenities included in the rent together with bills. Big gym, studying places, and cannabis/smoking friendly spots. It\u2019s a single bedroom apartment with big kitchen and personal large bathroom. The apartment comes fully furnished for the sleeping area, the kitchen zone, and the bathroom. THE PRICE IS OPEN TO NEGOTIATIONS.\n\nThe apartment is covid free and enforces very good covid protocols as indicated by the Government of Ontario. Perfect location as it\u2019s 1 min aways from the bus stop and very close to Carleton University, University of Ottawa, and Algonquin College (both by walk and bus rides).\n\nIn addition to that, it super close to the Billings Center Shopping Mall (one bus ride!). I have also the link for looking at the room setup if you want. Here is the link: amenities: [https://revalieottawa.ca](https://revalieottawa.ca/) PS: the apartment is available from May 2022 to August 2022 and available for renewal.",

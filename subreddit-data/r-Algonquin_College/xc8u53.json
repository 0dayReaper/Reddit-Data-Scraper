    "postText": "Hey I will be starting college in January CP and teaching myself web dev on the side \n\nWas wondering what frontend frameworks does the college teach and what are job opportunities for each in Ottawa. \n\nI will be moving from BC, I just want to prepare myself for the job market frontend/ backend/Fullstack etc. I looked for jobs for React / Angular and React seems to be winning. \n\nI just wanted to hear what you guys have to say about that. Thanks and have a great day \ud83d\ude42",

Currently we teach React. We dropped Angular about 5 years ago. React much more popular in Ottawa.\n\nDon't know if either are currently taught in other programs.",

Currently, we haven't touched any frontend frameworks since we're backend heavy (C#/PHP). This might change in our 4th semester though in one of our courses.\n\nLike you I'm also learning React to supplement my frontend skills (we learned the basics of JavaScript in our first semester). Hope this give you an idea, not too sure if CP or CET teaches frontend libraries/frameworks as well.",

But it never hurts to learn even the basics of frameworks just to understand the overall web dev ecosystem. And it will help solidify topics when taught in college.\n\nI think CP is almost all backend focused with emphasis on java, databases, etc which I don't mind. I like the frontend layer because it helps me visualize what code is doing and assists with overall learning process. Hopefully by the end of the program it will make me a kickass Fullstack developer lol\n\nThanks for the reply and good luck with your studies :)",

I don't think it will be taught in this program, but I'm not too sure. I opted to teach myself full-stack web-development during this 8-month coop period and it's going rather well. The online material I learn from uses React as a front-end framework, here's the link if you're interested (it's completely free):\n\n[https://fullstackopen.com/en/](https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents)\n\nI think in fourth year there is the opportunity to teach ourselves with CST8333 \"Programming Language Research Project\".\n\nIf you're interested in more resources to learn programming, this could be helpful: \n\n[https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)",

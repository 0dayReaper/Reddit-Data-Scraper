    "postText": "Hi!\n\nWe are a group of third-year Graphic Design students at Algonquin College. We have been tasked by the City of Ottawa with creating better signage and road markings to help reduce dooring. We are looking for people who drive or bike. You don\u2019t have to be living in Ottawa to help us with our research, as information from other areas will help us gain further insight.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to our study, please fill out this Google Form: [https://forms.gle/Nxp7DnkyHevcDhCS8](https://forms.gle/Nxp7DnkyHevcDhCS8)\n\nThanks for your help!",

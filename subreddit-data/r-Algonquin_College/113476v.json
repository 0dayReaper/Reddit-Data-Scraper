Most programs that ladder into a Comp Sci is a 3 year advanced diploma and the schools are Windsoru, Trent, Guelph and MacMaster Software Eng B Tech.  I think trent will give you 50% credit into Comp Sci proper. \n\nIT is a lot about certs- don't know if you need the bachelor.  I'm a perspective mature students for the spring.  I've worked in IT at a VAR and MSP in sales and want to go hands on now to move into consulting or technical sales.",

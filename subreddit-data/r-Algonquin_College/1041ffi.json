    "postText": "  Hi, I'm Don (The Anti-Chef) Welbourne, A You Tube content creator and O.D.S.P. recipient. And this is my channel on you tube. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJaejVmFseKqc773EeWj41w\n\nMy channel was started to help people on meagre or no budget for food to inspire them to stretch their food bank fare and cook like a Chef. 34,000 + in our community use food banks every month and usually there is maybe one or two obvious meals in what you get the rest most people scratch their heads and wonder what to do with. I've seen friends who use the food bank have nothing but P.B. on crackers 2 days after they've gone to the food bank because they don't know what to do with the food they got. So I created:\n\n\"Don's Empty Kitchen, the poor man's bounty\" How Too \"Cook like a Chef!\" on a fixed income or low budget... Take that food bank bag that may have one or two meals at best and turn it into 5-7 days worth of belly filling, spirit lifting food for your family (or just for yourself) that you can be proud of. Just because you're poor doesn't mean you don't have value. I'm going to try and inspire you to cook well for those you love! it will boost everyone\u2019s ego to sit down at the end of the day to a beautiful, tasty meal. And no one stretches a meal better then me! so let's cook!\n\nAnd here's where I need your help, Share this post, help me find a few strong healthy volunteers to pick up food bank fare and deliver it to my apt. (as I am a disabled shut-in) but I'm also a culinary trained passionate home cook. I'm not looking for food just for myself, I have more important motives... I'm offering to go through your food bank order with you (on or off camera) make a meal plan with you, and even cook it for you! I just need to film it while I'm doing it. why not have a cordon Bleu (almost graduate) work for you for free! I get content for my channel and you get to either learn or just have chef inspired meals for you and your family. Just get me the food and I'll do the rest!\n\nFor those of you who have read this and wish to donate money or food of your own, Thank you!.. but no thank you. Give it to the food banks! I do ok on my meagre $545.00 a month and I pride myself on that. Just share this post that's how you can help. Thanks for reading I really appreciate it. \n\nCheck out my channel and subscribe please.\n\nThank you\n\nDon (The Anti-Chef) Welbourne.",

            "comment": "Any reason why you chose CP over CET? From what I read on this sub, getting a Co-op is easier with CET. Especially if one is a non-tech person. Also, I am joining in fall 2023. DM me if you are searching for an accommodation near the college. I am moving in April but will start studying in Sep.",

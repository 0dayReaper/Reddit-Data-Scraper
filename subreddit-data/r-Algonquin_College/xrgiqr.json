It\u2019s either going to be work(probably telecommunications) or more school. There are plenty of options though. Some people do this to become an electrician, some people move onto engineering. Some of the professors were in the program and moved onto become engineers like Travis, Keith, etc. Some people become technologists like Stephanie. The professors have a little more experience with pathways because they\u2019ve seen it all happen. Especially the older professors like Gary, Frank, Michel, etc. They might be in a better position to handle that question. If you want to become an electrician, I would speak with Peter V. because he was an electrician for a very long time.",

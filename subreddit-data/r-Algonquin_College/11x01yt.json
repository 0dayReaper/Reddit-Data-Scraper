I didn\u2019t pay attention in high school and want to improve my grades and worth ethic. Any advice, and how did it help you for your programs?",

Between the knowledge you gain and work ethics you have to build it\u2019s a great program to start with",

I do have two kids though so that\u2019s kind of like a job \ud83d\ude02 if you have good time management skills, you may be able to, but it\u2019s recommended that you don\u2019t work through it.",

I was in the same boat, didn\u2019t pay much attention in high school and needed to improve my marks to get into nursing. I\u2019m currently in nursing at uottawa and without pre health that wouldn\u2019t be the case. The workload can be a lot but depending on what classes took in high school it\u2019s very repetitive",

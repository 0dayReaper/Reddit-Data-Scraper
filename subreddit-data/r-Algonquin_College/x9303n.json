Some days may have large gaps in the schedule or may have very late days.  For example, one of my classes runs 19:00-21:00.\n\nI have seen students that work through it.  Often, working on weekends and the odd week day.  It is doable, but be aware that your schedule is going to be very random.  If you are familiar with the concepts and have some computing background, you may have an easier time of it.",

So their day started at 8:00 and they got home by 20:00 if they were lucky and there was no issue with the busses.",

    "postText": "Hi there. I am a 1st semester student in computer programming (co op) and I am pretty sure I'm going to fail intro to computer programming CST8116.\n\n I know I should be talking to the prof about all this but I was just wondering if anyone had an idea of the implications of this and what my options might be for retaking it and the progression of the program for me. \n\nI don't know If I'm going to be able to just retake this course or if I will have to restart the program entirely, I don't expect to fail any other course. Any input would be helpful to ease my anxiety about it.\n\nThanks.",

Truly it isn\u2019t. \nYou can retake the course you failed and do the other two courses you are eligible for. \nThe beauty of this program is that it has year round in takes. You can catch up the three other courses over the summer. \n\nAre you part of the discord?",

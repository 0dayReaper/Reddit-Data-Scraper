The campus is lovely, it's just one pretty new building basically in a park right on the Ottawa River. The town is small and sleepy, doesn't seem like there's a lot going on. I wouldn't expect to get much of the full college experience there, but if you like small towns and a more quiet and chill experience it might work for you.",

    "postText": "1. How competitive is the program? Is it easy to get into the online computer programming with decent marks? Or do you need a really high average?\n\n2. If I'm doing full time online, what if the fastest I can complete the program in? Is it possible to finish it quicker or take longer as you like? What is the average time it takes to complete the program?\n\n3. For those who completed the program without coop, how hard was it to find a job afterwards? If I may ask, what job did you land and how is the salary?\n\n4. How much is the tuition? For the full time online? I was told it is free if you are making under a certain amount of money annually? Is that true?\n\n\nI know I asked some dumb questions lol, but I would be grateful if they are answered. Thank you",

Beyond the usual fall, winter, and spring terms. I think courses are offered every two months (not 100% sure). Technically could finish the program in a year and a half if you really go pedal to the metal. The courses are about 450-550 each. \n\nIf you wanna chat to ppl currently in the program or who\u2019ve graduated come join our discord server: https://discord.gg/w6vhBhkr.",

            "comment": "I think it is probably easy to get in because it is one of the few programs that starts 6x a year (every two months). So this, combined with the fact that it is a-sync, means they can handle a lot of capacity imo. You do need to pass a math test if you don't have the math pre-req. It's not hard, although you might want to brush up on your pre-calc and pre-algebra at khan academy just in case.   \n\n\nThe fastest you can complete the program is 16 months. Each semester takes about 3.25 to 3.5 months, and you can immediately start another semester at the 4 month period.  \n\n\nI'm just in second year so cannot comment on finding a job.   \n\n\nTuitition is 1500 a semester. There are some fees for books as well, although you can get most of the textbooks for free online (libgen.is) . OSAP will pay that for virtually anyone imo (unless you are high income). Not only that, if you are low income, they will probably give u decent living expenses.",

Also, how would the application process go? I could just apply any time and start at one of the 6x it starts? Thanks for the reply",

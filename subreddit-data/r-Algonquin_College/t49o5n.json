    "postText": "I got accepted into dental hygiene, MRT and respiratory therapy for the fall 2022. Im having a hard time picking between MRT and dental hygiene. I did as much research as i could and an leaning towards dental hygiene, but at the same time, based off of what hygienists themselves have told me, the job can become mundane and is very repetitive, yet the salary is pretty high. I\u2019ve heard that MRT is pretty saturated right now. If anyone is working as a MRT or dental hygienist:\n1)do you enjoy your job? \n2)was it easy to find a job? \n3)is the salary good\n4) are you planning on studying something else\n5) how long have you been working in the field?\n\nor if anyone has had to pick between MRT and dental,  what did you pick and what would you recommend?",

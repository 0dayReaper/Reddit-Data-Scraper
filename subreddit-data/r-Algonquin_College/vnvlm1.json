    "postText": "Hello! My wonderful Trans daughter is going back to college. She has been accepted into two programs and can't decide. Part of the worry is job stability, difficulty of course load, and acceptance. She is hoping to find a program that will be accepting and welcoming as a trans women. Her last program was in a male dominated program it seemed and she wasn't out at the time.  She feels like both programs are wonderful choices. But with this being her second program she's hoping it will allow her some job stability. I've heard photography is very competitive in Ottawa and jobs aren't abundant. But I could he wrong . Would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions on either program ! Thank you",

Both tend to have very diverse student groups (I teach at the college) and both programs are well-managed. \n\nPhotography probably a little harder to get a job, so more freelance work may be required after graduation.\n\nThere's always a need for horticulturalists / landscaping in this area.",

Get a stabler job with the city (benefits, pension etc) and then set up a small business from her home/apartment and have a flex income.",

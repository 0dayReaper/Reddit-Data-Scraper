    "postText": "Hi everyone, my name is Tyler &amp; I am a student at Algonquin College\n\nSome colleagues and I are working on our final project for our mobile application development program. Our application is about making it easier for homeowners to claim **retrofits**.\n\nSo if you are a **homeowner** and live in **Ontario** could you kindly please fill out the survey below? It's not long and will help us out more than you know.\n\nYour name is optional, and any answers or data you submit will only be used in the context of assisting us in making design decisions for our app.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n[https://forms.gle/RuAKiJTCfG3idQsa9](https://forms.gle/RuAKiJTCfG3idQsa9)",

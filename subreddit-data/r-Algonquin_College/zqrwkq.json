First year doesn't deviate too much from those scheduled times. Second year may have a funnier schedule because that's when everyone will be in hospitals and those times are a bit more sporadic, but your instructor will let you know on your first day.",

NEVER go by the ACSIS schedule for your clinical hours. It will always be HSPnet and your clinical instructors. \n\nYour clinical hours will change each semester and so will the days!",

Either that or they don\u2019t want anyone to drop out before paying for the second semester. \n\nSecond semester gets a little more difficult and much more focussed on useful material and concepts. \n\nSecond year continues to build on the foundations from the first year. Sometimes it felt like a lot between all the different classes, but everything kind of starts to blend together near the end and you realize how these different concepts interact with each other for real world applications. \n\nTechnologist (if you choose to do the extra year) is the biggest jump in difficulty by far. The year is mostly focussed on your \u201cthird year project\u201d, a good/bad group can make or break your year and the math course is one of the hardest you\u2019ll take at Algonquin. \n\nThe majority of the professors/instructors (assuming most of them are still there) are fantastic and always willing to help as much as they can so long as you make the effort to go to class/complete your work.",

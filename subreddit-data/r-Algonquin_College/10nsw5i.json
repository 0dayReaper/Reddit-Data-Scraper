I finished it in about 2 hrs. \n\nNo passing criteria per say (although I have hear they email you immediately if you don\u2019t surpass the cut off score. I don\u2019t know what that would be though). Your score and what would get you into the program is dependent on how well everyone else has done who is also applying to your program.",

Thankyou for the information ! i m curious to know about what were the  type of questions from science subjects and from arithmetic and reading.\n\nalso did they ask chemistry in deep like solubility, equations etc. please do reply my questions. i am nervous. Also i did higher studies in 2011. so completely forgot everything and i have to start from scratch.",

Clearly you seem to not have achieved that goal and that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t come here to say that the goal is not worth it. To me my hard work and studying as aggressive as I did and making deans list every term is what I wanted for myself",

For example: Nipissing is partnering with Algonquin they have a base requirement of 2.7, now if you look at University of Ottawa the GPA requirement is 3.2 and Carlton is 3.6",

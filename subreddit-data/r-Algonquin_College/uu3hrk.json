Open to post-secondary students only. Course classroom subject to change. \r  \n\r  \nTo sign-up for the mailing list so that you're notified about these and future courses: https://forms.gle/DQ2sy8mLjNwARWzP6\r  \n\r  \nIf you are a Canadian University Shooting Federation (CUSF) member, you will be given a grant of $75.00 ($50 PAL &amp; $25 RPAL.

Once you've taken it, passed the written and practical exam, you will then wait a few weeks to receive some test paperwork. Once you have that, you can send it in with your application to the RCMP. Then they sit on the application for a minimum of 28 days before opening it.  \nIf you also want your RPAL you will need to take the CRFSC course as well. The most common courses being offered right now are the combined course. It's usually 2-3 days long and will allow you to apply for your PAL and RPAL at the same time.",

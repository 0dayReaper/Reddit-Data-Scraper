    "postText": "Hello, I am a computer programming student level 3 at Algonquin college. I was kicked off co-op cause, I failed Math my first semester. However, I managed to find my own 8-month co-op position. My job is in jeopardy because I need to get a letter from my college stating I am registered as a full-time student. I went to my program coordinator and he told me, he cannot give me the letter because I am not coming back to school for summer and fall. That is because I have co-op (which I found on my own), I will however return to school in Winter 2024 for my final semester. Did anyone have this issue before? Any advice..? I don't want to lose my co-op term with my employer.",

I don't know if that'll work and I don't know if that's legal just a shower thought I had. (I don't encourage this and I am not liable lol)",

With co-op, they usually hire you through the co-op office. With internship, it goes through you directly. It is technically the same as both usually require the student to be enrolled full-time. \n\nI'm in the on-line version of the program (no co-op) and I also found an internship for the summer and that's how I provided my future employer with the info.\n\nEdit: grammar stuff!",

I am currently interviewing for part time and full time positions, that are offering to send me to complete the program after 8 months of working with them.\nThe reason the employer is asking for proof for registration is so that they can claim your pay through a government subsidiary program (ie tax write off).\n\nIn all honesty you don\u2019t need a co-op position with the program we are taking, there is so much demand it is insane. Either look for the full time, part time, fswep employment opportunities or just complete the program since you are \u201cout of co-op  cycle\u201d you will get snagged for jobs immediately.\n\n*edit I am also in level 3 Computer programming, going to level 4 in May.",

So for example if you start in September 2023, you will start second semester in January 2024, and third semester May 2024 and your first co-op term will be September 2024 to December 2024 then your second co-op term will be January 2025  until April 2025, then you complete your last semester from May 2025- August 2025.\nLet me know if you have any more questions or concerns.",

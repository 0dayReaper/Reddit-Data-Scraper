    "postText": "I\u2019m starting the CST - Networking program in Sept. and have been trying to change my timetable through ACSIS &gt; Courses &gt; Drop/Add/Transfer. When I try to make any changes I end up at a page saying \u201cThere are no approved course sections available that you may drop. Please see your department.\u201d \n\nWill I need to call to make changes or can I expect this to open up in the next week?\n\nThanks!",

I can guarantee that if you are starting level 1, you are locked into your schedule. \n\nThey do not allow students to change their timetables and or schedules until level 2.\n\nHow do I know?  My daughter is entering level 3 of CST this fall.  She went through the same song and dance while trying to fix her schedule to be able to keep her part time job.",

Even after the withdraw date when people dropped out last semester he wouldn\u2019t let me switch for \u201creasons\u201d. \n\nContact your coordinator, maybe you\u2019ll have better luck with yours. But don\u2019t get your hopes up to high. It\u2019s disappointing, I know.",

    "postText": "So I'm taking a Bookkeeping course in September that requires a textbook with an access code included in it. To save money and space (I live in a small apartment),  I'm going to go with a digital rental of the book.\n\nHow does that whole thing work? Once I order it, will I instantly be sent an email with information on how to access my textbook digitally and what about the access code I'll need for my code? Does that get sent to me too? \n\nI'm just looking for anyone who's used digital rentals of textbooks before to tell me how the whole process works. Please let me know.",

If you have a class that incorporates the textbook in the course load (I.e. quizzes, assignments etc), you will receive the access code from your facilitator. I would recommend waiting to order anything until you start the courses as the facilitator may offer a cheaper way to buy the digital textbook/ tell you exactly what's needed.",

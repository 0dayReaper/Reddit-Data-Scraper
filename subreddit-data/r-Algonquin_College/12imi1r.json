    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for an ideal location to study / work on assignments with a major focus on computer use. Ideally a room / lab where I can plug-in external monitors to my laptop for programming assignments. Even better would be a space with privacy however it\u2019s more important to me to have access to external monitors than privacy. \n\nI\u2019ve been attending Algonquin College for a few years but I have yet to find an ideal location like this. \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated. \n\nThanks!",

Also I haven't see any kinda 2 screen set up so even if you end up getting your docking station with you you'll only end up with 2 monitors (counting the laptop monitor with it). But yeah no 2 screen setup really just one screen as far as I know.",

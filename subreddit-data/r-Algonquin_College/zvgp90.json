    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm a 20 y/o interested in the field of animation(currently a 3rd year studying something else). I've never taken an art class before so I know that I can't get into any animation programs (since they require a portfolio). Instead, I'm looking into art fundamentals programs and was wondering if someone could give their take on Algonquin's drawing foundations program. My goal is to learn the basics and get into a good animation program. I live in Ottawa so it would be more convenient to go to Algonquin, although I've heard that Sheridan's program might be better. Any suggestions/thoughts are appreciated :) Also willing to provide more details, please help!",

            "comment": "I have a good friend (from highschool) who went into the animation program at Algonquin. He currently works at Mercury Film Works (who are contracted to work on Disney/Pixar, Netflix, and more high profile properties). He was seriously into drawing, starting in high school/before, and built a portfolio to get into the animation program at Algonquin. He was focused on constant practice and made impressive improvements while we took art classes together in highschool.\n\nWhat he has told me about the animation program was that it was incredibly demanding and that he could never do it if he was not heavily interested with drawing/animation and constantly improving at it. During this period he was practicing everyday for hours, required for meeting the high expectations of the program. I remember going over to his place and he was working on a massive backgrounds, drawing and developing characters - literally hundreds of drafts and iterations.\n\nAt Mercury, he describes it as incredibly demanding. Often with extremely tight deadlines and high requirements for consistent high quality, it's no joke. He said it is a great company to work for though, with a positive work environment and good pay.\n\nIf you want to become an animator, it sounds like you need to throw yourself into it. It takes thousands of hours of practice, study, and learning. \n\nHe absolutely loves it, and it is definitely possible, but has a high skill/practice requirement. More important than school, it was the hours spent at home developing yourself which he said was the real key to his long term success.",

            "comment": "I know quite a bit about the CYC program. The course load is heavy but very manageable. In year one you take all on-campus courses; six per term. If you start in January, you will do level 2 in May and then jump straight into level 3 in Sept so be mindful that you will not have a break longer than 2 weeks between terms until May 2024. \nIn years 2 and 3 you are only on campus 2 days a week as the other 3 days you are in placement at an agency. \nThe atmosphere is positive, with a lot of community building within classes. It is a very experiential program. \nFeel free to ask if you have more specific questions.",

    "postText": "Hi, guys\n\nDid you guys receive titled \" You've applied to a ranked program\" email?  \nI applied for 3 different programs and I only receive the email for 2 programs.\n\nI feel like I was supposed to receive 3 emails for 3 each program, and I received 2 emails for the same program and the last one is for another program.\n\nI haven't receive this email for the program I really want to get in.\n\nAnd I am so worried.\n\nWhen I contact the register office, they just told me that they received my three applications.\n\nI checked my application status on my ACSIS account and ontariocolleges website.\n\nand I could see all of my applications there.\n\nI was wondering whether I should be concern about it or it is not a big deal.\n\nI really really want to get into the program (that I haven't received any update email from the college) so I am quite nervous.\n\nAny advise would be appreciate.\n\nThank you!!\n\n####",

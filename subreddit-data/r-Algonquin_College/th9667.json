Especially if we are returning to campus. Expect classes everyday usually 8am to 5pm with breaks in between but classes have and can go until 10pm, and two days per week you will be doing placement. It\u2019s every week, hours depend on the facility. For me it was Monday and Tuesday, 7am to 4pm by the time we did post conference. Some places  do evenings, it just depends on the place you get. \n\nI found it super hard to work during this program and I was online. I would be optimistic with your work and let them know this is a full time commitment and you won\u2019t be working much!",

    "postText": "Hi there, I\u2019m an international student and I\u2019m applying for Algonquin. I took Udemy tutorials before and I\u2019m building websites with Vue.js, hoping to become a web developer.  Now I\u2019m considering programs like CP, Web Development and MAD&amp;D. I know from former posts that MAD&amp;D is more up-to-date than WD, but I also heard that Co-op experience is essential for international students, it will be more challenging to land on a job after graduation without local working experience and PR. I really don't know how to choose between the programs TAT What\u2019s your advice and how\u2019s the employment rate of international students in MAD&amp;A?\nTHANK U!!!!!",

Coordinator of MAD&amp;D here. \n\nEmployment stats for the last two years have been - over 50% of our graduating class had employment before finishing classes in the final level. over 75% within a month of finishing the final level. I don't have exact numbers for the international students but roughly half our class was international for each group.",

I would like to know the current employment rate for the most recent graduating class. Could you please provide me with this information? Thank you.",

I don't know what has happened with every student who just finished.\nHowever, based on my communications with them, I can tell you that at least 60% are already employed in industry.",

You gain work experience in your final semester with your capstone project where you build an app for a real-world client. \n\nIf you apply yourself and succeed in your courses, you should have no problem finding a job after graduation.",

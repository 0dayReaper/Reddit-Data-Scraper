I don't have the reddit chat feature.

Being someone who was &lt;30 and knowing COBOL was a huge advantage for areas that still maintain legacy systems. Banks, credit card companies, and some airports still use COBOL so I found it useful. That being said it may make more sense to just check out Tutorialspoint or use your Lynda.com subscription and learn COBOL on your own and then learn C. It depends on how good you are at self directed research. That and if Mel \"Captain COBOL\" is still teaching.",

My employer was impressed with the work I did in a group for my final semester for the university of Ottawa and the study groups I was part of. So in short the coop experience and the collaboration.

Sorry If these questions are a bit naive currently doing A levels and will be applying to unis / colleges for the Winter 2020 session \n\n1. I still haven't made my mind up to do a degree from a university or a college either way I would want to do computer science with co-op . What would you recommend ? As a student with a diploma did you find your self lacking applying to other jobs ? Will I have a disadvantage studying at a college ( as in less expertise / underqualified ) \n\n2. By 2 year + coop do you mean a totaly of 3 years or were those coop terms included in you study \n\n3. For an Undergrad would your recommend \nA. Computer science / computer engineering\nB.  Computer Programming\n\nOnce again , would appreciate the advice and if you have anything in mind other then these question be sure to let me know \ud83d\ude0a",

Unfortunately I am not familiar with university provided education for computers. I'd think that would have a higher ceiling given the degree that which you are learning the theory. I'm earning a comfortable amount at my job and the government is the biggest employer here. I never found a lack of job opportunities after college.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n2. I did two years of school and one year of coop. But one of those coop terms was during the summer. So really five semesters of school then two semesters of coop the. One semester school.\n\n  \n\n\n3. I feel like your guidance counselor would be a better person to contact or even going to the registrar's office and ask them to direct you to the right person. I went computer programming and landed myself a job. That's what I wanted to do. I don't know how future proof my job is. That is something you'll have to compare the curriculums for and research the trends going on where you wish to apply. Government is slower to adapt so current trends are fine. You can also check out to see what Blackberry is doing with automated cars and the other industries out there around the NCR. I am also personally worried about my career due to the rise of machine learning. I think that might be something you'll want to look into.\n\n  \n\n\nI don't have anything at the moment to add but I'll look over the question tomorrow when I am on lunch to see what I can add that might be helpful.",

But that gets thrown out the window if Quantum Computing becomes a contender. In which case you are faced against machine learning backed up by quantum computing.",

One of the main reasons for this is that I hear that the CET course can get you directly into a CS-02 position while the computer programmers start at CS-01. So I guess my question would be, do you know anyone that took the computer programmer course that ended up getting a CS-02 role directly after graduation?

The issue with not going through coop is that you fall in that junior programmer with 13 years experience trap. With coop you get an in and since they has you for several months they want to keep you. \n\nWhat my boss said after a few months of being hired was \"we take college students, not for what they know, but because we know that they can learn\". That and you get interviews through a much smaller pool. Whenever you get an interview and they ask questions always ask \"based upon what I have demonstrated what is one skill I ought to work on between now and when I am hopefully hired that I should brush up on\". They love that. \n\nThe problem with having web programing as your took kit is that, while yes it is good to have, but so many companies just use drag and drop tools. Why create a website when you can just use square space or put shit together using the tools on Amazon? My friend went with web programming and eventually she got burnt out because of all the automated tools that the preferred. That and with web programming it is really stressful because it's an iterative process and customers never know what they want or how difficult it is to code for. \n\nFrom what I've been hearing, a major thing to focus on is cloud programming and mobile programming.",

When is the best cohort to join in September or in January?\nAlso, I am a permanent resident, any idea if gov coops prefer Canadian citizens over PRs. I mean do they highlight in the job application preference for Canadian citizens?\nThanks a lot :)",

I'm starting this program in Sept. and my primary concern is that I want nothing to do with gvmt jobs and working for the public sector, but it seems like the program sort of sets you up to work with gvmt. Are there even many companies in private sector to apply to for co-op? I don't want to pigeonhole myself into gvmt.",

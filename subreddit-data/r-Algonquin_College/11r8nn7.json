We are studying the hydration habits of people working in the trades. It would help us out a lot if anyone would be able to fill out our survey. To qualify, you need to be currently working in the trades, and be between the ages of 19 and 35. \n\nThe link to the survey is: [https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/AC-MKT2307HydrationSurvey](https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/AC-MKT2307HydrationSurvey) \n\nThanks to anyone who can fill it out!",

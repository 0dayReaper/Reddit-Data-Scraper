    "postText": "From what I can see (looking at Algonquin's web site) they have no such thing.\n\nI work full-time for the federal government (not in IT).\n\nI have taken several IT certifications and am definitely capable of doing the work for many of the IT jobs posted with the federal government BUT I.T. positions with the feds require a 2-year IT diploma (somewhat of a rubber stamp).\n\nDoes Algonquin have a 2-year diploma that can be completed online?\n\nOf course the answer is \"look at their web site\"...I did this but maybe I missed it.\n\nAnyone know of a 2-year diploma that I can take online? Ideally from a Canadian university/College.\n\nThanks.",

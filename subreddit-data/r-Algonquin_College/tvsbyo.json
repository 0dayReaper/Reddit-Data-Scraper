    "postText": "Hi I'm about to start a job at algonquin. most of the nearby housing options I have been able to find are for students, which is not what I'm looking for, so I was wondering if anyone had some advice about general areas of ottawa that are only one bus away from the college, preferably like less than 20 min, so I can direct my apartment search?  right now I live in centretown and it's a crazy commute. Like is there a direct bus from westboro maybe?\n\nor even if someone knows what busses go to the college I can check the route on google maps to see where some convenient apartments might be lol.  TIA!",

It can be very packed at times and may pass by if full during peak times (pre-covid at least)\n\nBaseline Station is right at the college so any route that stops there will work (74, 75, 87, 111 are all relatively \"frequent\" busses, 82 &amp; 86 are less so but still work).\n\nPlease double check my numbers, as I could be wrong. Best of luck.",

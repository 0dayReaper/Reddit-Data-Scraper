However, if you get through the course you\u2019re almost guaranteed a job. Ottawa is in an animation hub and studios are desperate for fresh blood.",

Not going to pretend it wasn\u2019t challenging. \n\nThe classes are pretty long, and you have to learn and hone your drawing skills in a reasonably short amount of time, since the program is 3 instead of 4 years. I definitely spent late nights or entire nights, working in the classroom, but there are often other students there to keep you company and bond with.\n\nThe teachers can sometimes be a little brutally honest about your work, so you have to learn to take feedback well. \n\nAnd finally, it\u2019s a lot of work but if you put in the time, you will succeed. The program has a pretty high dropout rate (at least it did when I was there) but if you keep at it, it\u2019s a really good program and you learn a lot, some studios look to the program\u2019s third year students for new hires. I came in as a pretty low level artist compared to my fellow students but I was able to keep up (sometimes just barely) and I\u2019m now working at an animation studio in Ottawa.\n\nIdk hopefully that helps? Let me know if you have any other questions.",

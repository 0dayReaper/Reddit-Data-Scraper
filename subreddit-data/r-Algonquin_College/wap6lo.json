    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m contemplating a change of careers via the Administrative Assistant course with a PT online delivery.\n\nHas anyone done this or a similar PT program remotely? What is it like?\n\nI\u2019m told it\u2019s asynchronous and everything on your own time- including tests- and that each course would take 3-5 hours of work per week. Is this accurate?\n\nI\u2019ve got 2 undergrads from a decade ago, so I\u2019m not foreign to higher education, but tech isn\u2019t something I\u2019m *super* proficient in (passable, yes).\n\nThanks for your time!",

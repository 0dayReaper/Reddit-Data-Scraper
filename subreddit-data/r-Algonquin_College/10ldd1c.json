Some of them are more useful than others, so I got some hard copies (pt management is useful - more for studying during clinical for the CAMRT exam) and just used the digital ones for the ones that I would occasionally read (ex: the digital radiography PACS stuff) since the slides provided in class are really good. You can reach out if you have questions too :)",

    "postText": "Right now I am pretty set on taking medical radiation technology. However there are some other programs that I am curious about (practical nursing, BscN, sonography, cardiovascular tech, respiratory therapist, etc). I work at the ottawa hospital and I've spoken to a number of healthcare professionals about their work. \n\nJust wondering if anyone here has any advice?",

I wouldn\u2019t recommend the program if you are not a hands-on, lab-focused person. The program is a little disorganized and unforgiving. That being said, some students are doing great, although no one breezes through it. But if you like the 12 hour shifts, high stress, dynamic and challenging environment, I would recommend it.",

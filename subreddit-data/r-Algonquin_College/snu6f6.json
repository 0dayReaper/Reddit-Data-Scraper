The program also mentions a coop portion, what are the job prospects like for coop and the job opportunities after graduation?",

            "comment": "A shit show in short. \n\nThe co-op and a chance to get a government placement are the ultimate goals of this program. I share this sentiment with a lot of the students. I was lucky to get the placement that I wanted but I think there were less than 10 cybersecurity co-op jobs in the first round of co-op job search. \n\nI think the first couple of years for this program would be rough. I wasn't impressed so far by the quality of  teaching nor the materials, most of the lectures, labs and assignments weren't ready nor fleshed out.\n\nIt's a very demanding program and if you want to do well then you have to spend most of your time studying, crypto labs take 10-15 hours each.\n\nI don't advice you to take this program if you don't have experience in IT or a bit in security.\n\nIf you want to prep then do a couple of COMPTIA certs first.\n\n\nDM me your questions.",

There are guys with me in the program that had little IT experience and they are having a hard time.\n\nIf you are willing to spend time and learn then it's do-able.",

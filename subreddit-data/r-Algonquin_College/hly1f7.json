Algonquin's delivery costs won't suddenly be going way, way down so that they can drop tuition by 25%.  Even if it was, don't you think it would be hard to lower tuition when enrolment has declined? They are having to cancel entire programs this year because not enough people have enrolled to make them viable.",

                    "comment": "So programs are being cancelled so less costs for providing materials, teachers, time for schedule matters from other staff etc. It would be difficult but im also sure a lot of students will drop out due to their inability to pay tuition (which has extra fees of up to 1000 dollars to 2000 just take your tuition price and lower it from the fees you paid. Mine was \\~1500). The college has 21059 students all paying an avg of 2900. They are making  61071100  dollars a SEMESTER not a year. a 25% decrease is  45803325. On top of this they receive aid from the government that is not included in the number above. On top of both of that they also have the majority of their costs for things other than paying salaries included within each students fees as previously mentioned. So realistically taking my 1500 fees you can say that  31588500 is being covered just from student fees (this is an avg using my fees so the number isn't exact.) the college makes millions or even billions of dollars and receives government funding as well. Now the point of a petition is not to strong-arm them into giving us 25% lower tuition (ive made a post below on a different comment) its a tool for negotiation and its not probable that we will receive that I agree but its a starting point.",

Perhaps if you could get past thinking about yourself you might be able to imagine some reasons why it is a bad idea for the college to blow their wad now giving you lower tuition with all of the economic uncertainty and potentially declining enrolement. Argue all you want about quality of education but at the end of the day you are getting the same piece of paper and the same jobs.",

Ive just done some quick math to prove a point ive even stated in the post its my fees im doing numbers with. If you took the time to look at the treasury you'd see their projections. Which have gone up from last year along with some fees but the growth is larger. If you took time to look at your own resources you'd see.  uncertainty is among all of us. A college can rebound from potential losses because students will never stop trying to attend its a major college within Ottawa. The students who cant provide money cant rebound from this. This is all under the speculation that we DO receive a 25% reduction which as ive stated is unlikely. Were here to make a point and have a conversation about it with the college and that is the number weve decided on to start that conversation. At the end of the day some students wont be able to get that piece of paper.",

Some students have only been marginally effected by the pandemic situation and still want adequate education. When the professors' collective agreement gets renegotiated some students don't want their professors needing to get second jobs to support themselves. And it's always going to be salaries that get cut when things get tough for a public institution such as Algonquin.",

I just thought that was a silly point as OSAP does change when tuition costs are decreased or increased. It would be the same, just influenced from the petition. Also OSAP is mostly loans so if tuition is less, the loan would be less; you're spending less money, while also receiving some \"free money.\"",

Its to inform the college that the students believe the tuition price is too high for the quality of learning. How they choose to address it or if they choose to address it at all is besides the point of the petition. Its to be heard not to strong-arm them into changing it.  If the college does lower tuition we have made student quality of life better. Osap can be addressed but if you drop 2k and osap doesn't give u 2k extra it doesn't really change anything for you. So, the change is net neutral you have no reason to complain. Staff have a set salary of \\~6600 for full-time it is in affect October 1st 2020 so they will not be affected by tuition prices being lowered (most likely) its on their website ([https://www.algonquincollege.com/hr/academic/salary-schedule-for-full-time-academics/](https://www.algonquincollege.com/hr/academic/salary-schedule-for-full-time-academics/)). If they don't then at least we know they have heard us. We cannot go to the college so the services they are providing does not affect us. Our quality of learning WILL go down (depending on your program) and there will even be mandatory fees not covered or included in your tuition (again depending on you program). Why would we not speak about this important topic to them. Even if they do change it it doesn't even have to be 25% its just a tool to start a conversation on the topic.",

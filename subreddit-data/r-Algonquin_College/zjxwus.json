For example, if we look at the [Interactive Media Design](https://www.algonquincollege.com/mediaanddesign/program/interactive-media-design/#courses) program, it shows the co-op semester running between Levels 3 and 4 whereas if you were in the [Bachelor of Digital Marketing Communications](https://www.algonquincollege.com/mediaanddesign/program/bachelor-of-digital-marketing-communication/#courses), it has three co-ops that run between Levels 4/5, 5/6 and 6/7.",

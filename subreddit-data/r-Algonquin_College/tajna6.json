Can anyone please help me to know on what should I focus on? I know about the study guide on their website, but any detail will help me. Thank you guys!",

The questions were practically identical on the hpat in terms of structure, numbers were different obviously. https://accuplacer.collegeboard.org/accuplacer/pdf/next-generation-sample-questions-arithmetic.pdf\nAnd https://td-practice.accuplacer.org/#/resumePracticeTestSession ( create an account for this). Make sure to know long division , decimals and percent calculations without a calculator.\n\nFor the science portion I would look up online tests for each unit and made sure what I was going over covered the Ontario Curriculum document that they provide. For example I would search SBI3C unit 1 test Or SCH4C organic chemistry test. Quizlets helped too. When I finished studying for the science portion i would search up general quizzes online of what I wanted to cover. I would type things like \"mitosis and meiosis quiz\", \"nervous system quiz\"  etc. The science portion is the most difficult part but just make sure you\u2019re leaving time to study for it because it\u2019s a lot! Dm me if you have any additional questions.",

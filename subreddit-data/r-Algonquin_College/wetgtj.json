    "postText": "So on the residence website I\u2019ve been looking for people to potentially room with but all my high percent matches are all wrong. I\u2019m not a sporty or outdoorsy person in the slightest yet that\u2019s the kind of people I\u2019ve been recommended to. I prefer to spend most of my time inside, although I like going out from time to time. I also like to watch YouTube and cartoons like She-ra and Dragon prince. I am also a member of the LGBTQ+ community as I identify as Pansexual. I\u2019m hoping that this reaches out to some people who have similar interests. My user is EmmaB780.",

Im not too concerned with the english - reading/ writing portion and math but have no idea what to study and how to prepare for the science portion - bio, chem- physics. Anyone have any recommendations/ suggestions/ advice on how to prepare or what topics to cover? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank  you! :)",

The sections are graded differently (so it\u2019s not one score you get at the end of the exam. You get a score on each section.) physics is worth 16% of the science grade, and as little as it seems, that 16% can be make or break for people wanting into really competitive programs.",

If it was below a 3.0 but higher than the 2.70 minimum it meant you just had to \"pass\" the HPAT, but again it LARGELY varies from program to program and HPAT scores, some are super difficult and have higher GPA considerations. \n\nyou're definitely correct when you say it doesn't prepare you for the content on the HPAT, the whole point of pre-health is to get good enough grades to make it past the HPAT and the cut off's of your program. it really ranges from program to program though, like this year your GPA had to be above a 2.70 in pre-health to not write the HPAT for the RPN program.",

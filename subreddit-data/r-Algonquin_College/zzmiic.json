Networking ties into this\n\nYou learn some scripting and data asking - programming jobs\n\nWindows Linux and cloud - system administration \n\nPc hardware and trouble shooting - IT related jobs. Although you may need to do all of the stuff above in an IT related job.",

I've seen you reply to a few posts on this so I thought I'd reach out.\n\nDo you have any idea if the CP&amp;A 3 year program is worth taking over the 2 year CP with co-op? \n\nI'm conflicted between these two programs and can't decide. Obviously there's a cost difference. I was originally thinking AC's mobile app dev &amp; design, but the third year of the CP&amp;A program seems like a condensed version of mobile, plus business intelligence. \n\nAny thoughts?",

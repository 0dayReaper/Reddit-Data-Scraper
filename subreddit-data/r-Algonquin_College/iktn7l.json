    "postText": "Hey guys, I am in the paramedic program and thankfully just completed my F Class License yesterday (thank god because I was getting pretty tired of dealing with DriveTest amiright?). I did my test at Walkley in Ottawa and the instructor, John, was tough but fair. He really wanted me to pass along some advice to other students who will be doing their road test. So I told him I would post and carry along his advice! \n\n1. When you do the In Cab test make sure you test the wipers and heater/defroster on low/medium/high. \n\n2. When he provides you with a section to check for the exterior test, he recommended that you start by reading off the minor and major defects from the schedule 2 first, THEN doing the demonstration, and finally reading the minor and major defects again. This way you know what you\u2019re looking for right off the bat. \n\n3. Make sure you know the anatomy of the vehicle!! He told me stories about students he\u2019s had come to do their F test, and they\u2019re not able to tell him where the spring leaf is, or the U bolt, or where the exhaust system is. If he asks you to show him something or tell him where something is and your answer is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d then it will probably be an automatic fail. \n\n4. Also if you\u2019re checking the exhaust system follow all the steps to check it as described in the MTO handbook, but also something he told me that I forgot to do was to check and make sure that the muffler was intact, not hanging loose from the vehicle and functioning properly so don\u2019t forget to do that. \n\n5. On his schedule 2 (that they use to test you) one of the sections says wheels, rims and bearings, and I didn\u2019t have that on my schedule 2. I thought that he meant wheels, hubs and fasteners (which is a section on the schedule 2 I had) so I did my best to check that section. He scolded me for that because he didn\u2019t ask about hubs or fastener. Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is demonstrate the procedure and talk about ONLY WHAT HE ASKS. If he doesn\u2019t ask about hub or fasteners don\u2019t do them. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask the instructors questions or to clarify as well. If he does ask you to check the wheels one thing I forgot to do was look behind/inside the wheel. Do check it\u2019s exterior quality but also look around inside it. \n\n6. He also asked me if there\u2019s lots of videos online about doing the F test. I told him there was 2 maybe 3 but none that really show the exterior test being done. Something useful he told me was to search for videos of the DZ or Z license test because it\u2019ll be very similar and help you learn the anatomy of the vehicle for the F.\n\nFinally something he said was to just take your time, ask questions, and don\u2019t rush! If you have any other questions please ask!!",

                    "comment": "Both times he got out of the vehicle naturally before I backed up, and during my first test (I failed it the first time) I kind of jokingly asked him \u201care you going to spot me?\u201d Because that\u2019s why I thought he was getting out. He kind of shrugged and said \u201cI can\u2019t really do that\u201d. I guess he\u2019s not supposed to help you, you need to really do it by yourself. So it didn\u2019t seem like a question he was expecting. The second time I did the test I didn\u2019t even ask him. He\u2019s just going to get out of the car to watch you and score you on how you do the backing up.",

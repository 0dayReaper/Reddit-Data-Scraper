But I got a \u201cloan\u201d through their loan partner Fairstone and I got a full year to pay it off without interest fees so I just saved up every month for it rather than dropping 1200 all at once. So there\u2019s that option too. Just ask about their loan program with Fairstone if financing is something you would need. It worked for me! \ud83d\ude0a",

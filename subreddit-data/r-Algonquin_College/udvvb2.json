    "postText": "Hey folks,\n\nI'm looking to enroll into the Architectural Technician course, and since I do not have Grade 11/Grade 12 Mathematics (only Grade 10), I'm looking to take the eligibility program MAP4C/MCF3M for admissions.\n\n1stly, can I take the test externally from TVO ILC/Blythe, or do I have to sit for it under Algonquin's jurisdiction?\n\n2ndly, will my Grade 10 Mathematics be enough as a pre-requisite for MCF3M, or do I have to take the official pre-requisite MFM2P to qualify?\n\nAny insight would be appreciated. Thank you!",

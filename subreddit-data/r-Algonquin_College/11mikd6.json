    "postText": "So for some context:\n\nCurrently attending Western university but I don't like my program and have had some personal issues come up leading me to fail quite a few courses. I decided to change programs and found Algonquin college.\n\nGraduated HS with 92 average\nWent to college for 1 year and graduated with honours.\n\nSo my previous grades are good but how do you guys think my university grades will affect my application? Do I still have a decent chance of getting in? \n\nLooking at computer programming 2 or 3 year options.\n\nAny input/insight would be helpful. Thanks.",

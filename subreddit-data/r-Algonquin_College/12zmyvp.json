    "postText": "Hi\nI have few questions about the Residence Advisor role. I hope someone in this sub is working as an RA.\n1. How many hours will we get per week to work if we are selected for an RA?\n2. Do we get a free meal plan? \n\nIf someone is working as an RA currently, can you please shoot me a Direct Message. Thank You.",

The hours usually don\u2019t go higher than 20 hours a week. There are also different kinds of shifts that\u2019ll have different hours. \n\n2. No, you don\u2019t get a free meal plan. though you do have access to the RA kitchen where there are some snacks you have access to \n\nHope this helps",

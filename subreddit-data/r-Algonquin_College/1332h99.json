I did try calling but the receptionist claimed to \u201c never heard about that\u201d although it\u2019s stated on their website under the Pre-Health program description.",

Links below:\n\nAsking the RO:\nwww.algonquincollege.com/ro/contact-us/ \nthen scroll down to \"Submit a help ticket\"\n\nAsking the SSS:\nwww.algonquincollege.com/academic-success/student-success-specialists \n\np.s. be sure to include your Student Number to ensure clarity and avoid back and forth trying to locate your file. If you can't find it check ACSIS and be sure to have your full name. \n\nGood luck",

This doesn\u2019t mean you get accepted, it means the program gives you the necessary prerequisites to apply.\n\nI think you may be referring to the articulation agreement that pre health has with dental hygiene.  It gives you a chance of getting into the program if you don\u2019t make it with your HPAT score and you e been waitlisted. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s only for current students coming out of pre-health but I could be wrong about that! Basically, if you get waitlisted and you have a high enough GPA you can get one of the saved seats they have for pre health students.\n\nThe only program that gets in automatically is practical nursing, with a final GPA of 3.0",

That\u2019s what I\u2019m confused about. But I think you are right and only applies to students that took pre health the previous year.",

            "comment": "2 spots of dental hygiene program is reserved only for pre-health students.\n\nDeciding factor for acceptance is ac-hpat test score, but your grade would be considered compared to other pre-health students who applied for dental hygiene program.\n\nI believe it is true that pre-health students can get into dental hygiene program way easier than other people. But you still have to take ac-hpat test and need better score than your friends in pre-health.\n\nYou cannot get accepted right away into dental hygiene even though you recently took pre-health program. ac-hapt still matters :(\n\nHowever, for practical nursing\n\nIt is guarantee that you can get into the program  as long as your average grade for pre-health is at least C or above.\n\nNot sure how articulation agreement worked back in 2017, but this is how it works now.",

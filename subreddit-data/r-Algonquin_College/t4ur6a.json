This isn't too bad, it just means a slightly longer rendering time. This is especially apparent in 4k content. If you do end up using AI for noise removal/enlargement then it'll be a lot slower. \n\nIf you have the 16gb of ram version, it should be fine. You may want to purchase an external SSD/HDD for file storage, or just grab one for backing up files.\n\nFor graphics output, since no specific GPU is named by Algonquin, Harmony software recommends a GTX 1060, minimum GTX 560. The M1 chip is nowhere close to a 1060, but is MUCH better than the minimum.\n\nTL;DR your laptop should be fine, recommended to pick up external storage but not required. It won't be the fastest computer to do the work on, but it should get the job done.\n\nFeel free to PM me any questions/comments/concerns you have",

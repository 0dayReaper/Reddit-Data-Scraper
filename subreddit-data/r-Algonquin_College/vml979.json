            "comment": "Windows work just fine. If you have a decent windows laptop and you are not familiar with Mac, I would not recommend you buy a Macbook.\nI uses Windows. Toonboom, Photoshop and Maya, they run smoothly on Windows. All of the assignments we get, they always have a Window and a Mac version. Heck, half of the profs use windows, the computers they use on campus to teach us run Windows.\nThe only concern is when u handing your assignments. It needs to be able to be opened on Mac, so .mp4 to .mov, .png to .jpeg. The assignment pdf should always tell you what types of file you need.",

It is in the sweet spot of comfortable to draw and portable enough to carry inside your backpack. In design class, you will be dealing with a lot of small details. I think having a bigger screen will make things more bearable. \n\nHope this helps.",

Not in Animation but in Game Dev it said we need to have a laptop with pretty beefy specs, ended up mentioning it to my coordinator and he said all the classrooms will have computers so a laptop isn't really required. Could be similar for you.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. For students already attending Algonquin, are all extra services included in the total tuition price (gym, counselling, etc)? I noticed the breakdown of tuition and the additional charges.. is it possible to opt out of any of these additonal services ?? (technology fee etc.) Are all of these helpful/necessary? \n\nAlso, how busy does the gym get? Is it hard to get a spot on the machines?",

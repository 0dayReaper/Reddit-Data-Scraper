    "postText": "Greeting, \n\nI wanted to have some information on that specific math class for computer science and or web development please. Would someone have a previous course outline. I am curious is this class is equivalent to a pre-calculus class? or a level before that? What are the subjects that are pre requisite to understand that class etc. I did  an equivalent of Grade 11 MCF3M long time ago.",

            "comment": "I did MAT8001C for computer programming. It\u2019s not bad. The course is split up into modules, I don\u2019t remember how many but you spend 2-3 weeks on each one depending how difficult it is, then the class takes a test on it, and you need to get 65% minimum on the test to pass the module. You need to pass all the modules to pass the course. You get 3 tries per test, but the other two are booked on your own time if you need them.\n\nThe modules are; computer number systems, algebra basics, trigonometry, factoring and solving equations, graphing, vectors, systems of linear equations.",

If ever you still have part of the course outline it would be helpful for me. Feel free to DM. Can I know what math class you did as a pre requise prior to this? was it a grade 11 and or grade 12 ontario class? and did you do it fresh out of highschool or maths or after long hiatus?",

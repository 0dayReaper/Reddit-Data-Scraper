    "postText": "hi everyone \n\nI just accepted the offer of admission of Computer system technician- Networking few minutes ago.\n\nI'm here to seek any suggestion or advice of how to take advantage of the summer to be prepared for the major. The biggest insecurity comes from the fact I have zero understanding of this computer system or the networking stuff.\n\nSo I'm wondering is there any books or videos you guys recommend? \n\nBy the way, what sorts of professional pathways I could take based on the program I choose? Any certificates you think it's important to have for to be fully marketable for the labor market?? \n\nThanks, also I welcome any connections, so feel free to comment below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Get a decent laptop (and by decent I mean anything that\u2019s not a chromebook lol and probably 16gb RAM or more) because you\u2019ll probably have to download and run a lot of programs at once. \n\nBut honestly don\u2019t stress too much over it, you\u2019ll be fine :) don\u2019t be afraid to ask your profs for help. they\u2019re there to help you!",

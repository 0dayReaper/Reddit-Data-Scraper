    "postText": "Just recently took the AC-HPAT and was struggling to find good info on this test online in terms of scoring and the sciences before I took it, so for future people frantically searching the web this is for you:\n\nThe essay is easy, read the level 8 practice essay and just copy structure and how many examples etc. I easily got 100% on it\n\nThe reading portion made me read it over and over again in confusion but I got most of it correct. Just make sure you take your time, a lot of the readings are on very complicated wordy passages like edgar allen poe type shit and it asks you to pick a choice as to what you think certain sentences are implying and etc, its pretty annoying. Ended up with a 96% on this portion\n\nThe math portion is easy but as they say, the more questions you get correct the harder the next question will be. Sometimes they asked me math questions so out of left field that I had never seen in my life. One was like \u201cn 2 decimals to the right of x which is a positive value and p is 1 decimal left of x. P+n is how many times te value of x?\u201d And I legit scrunched up my face and my brain just fried and I guessed a value and moved on lmao. Still got 93% on that portion\n\nNow the science portion is what fucked me up. Listen here yall, I already have bachelors in biology. I thought I had this but nooo honey. First off the lack of practice questions for the science portion is terrible. The only hint they give you is a whole ass course curriculum pdf on their website and I tell you I spent weeks studying that shit. Theres SO MUCH stuff to cover in case they might ask about it, meanwhile theres 25 bio 25 chem and 10 physics questions and the bio portion was easy first of all. The chemistry portion asks a looot about moles, molarity, calculating ph, determining what molecules are more polar or more acidic or more basic. And heres the worst part, they dont give you a periodic table. I was lucky I remembered the molar mass of hydrogen and carbon off the top of my head. So you get no periodic table or calculator for these portions which really caught me off guard. The physics portion is just a loooooot of calculations, they do give you the formulas though so you dont have to memorize those however you dont get a calculator on that portion either. So its just hours and hours of sitting on your ass doing long calculations that wouldnt take as long in the real world because calculators are a thing. I ended up with 42/60 for the science portion\n\nThe grading is:\n\nEssay is out of 8\n\nReading is out of 300\n\nArithmetic is out of 300\n\nScience is out of 60\n\nGoodluck yall. Im not sure if I will get in to the program but my grades on this test averaged out to a 90% so I hope I get in.",

            "comment": "I took the HPAT in February and this is super accurate. For the program I was applying for I didn\u2019t need physics, therefore I had never taken a course in my life and had to teach myself prior to the test via YouTube. I agree with everything but just a few things to add:\n\n- A lot of the math questions involve fractions and long division- math you may not have seen since elementary school that you may need to revise.\n- For the sciences, focus on the key components of a unit. Don\u2019t stress about the names of scientists and what their theory was or anything like that. I spent wayyy too much time trying to study minor tidbits of information that weren\u2019t even on the test.\n-The reading comprehension practice questions are identical to the format you\u2019ll see on your actual test, same with the practice math questions.",

Doesnt knowing the 3 laws and their impact matter more?? But no it literally gave me newtons law about how for every action theres an equal and opposite reaction and it told me to pick if it was the first, second or third of his laws. This question seriously pissed me off because who cares about the order??? How does that enlighten me in any way??? I know his laws I just didnt memorise \u201cohh hurr durr this is the first second and third one\u201d so sometimes they have stupid questions like that \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f mind if I ask what grade you got and if you got into your program? Im trying to get into practical nursing",

Your information is pretty accurate though. \n\nI would warn you, the cut off for the HPAT was in May for highly competitive programs like Practical Nursing. I made that mistake when I applied for Winter 2020 Practical Nursing.",

            "comment": "Took the HPAT in January and this is super accurate I'm going into practical nursing in the fall. Just a insider info, if your course you are applying to doesn't have a physics requirement they take those questions out when considering you for your program. Yes, you still have to answer the physics questions and it gets added in your total science mark for the test but the coordinators for your program don't look at those as they are not required. So try and not stress too much about the physics when looking to take the test. \n\nThe marking guide that is posted is pretty much accurate but for me when I did my average I thought I had about a 75% but when talking with the program coordinator I was one of the highest scored people who had applied and my mark was actually probably around a 90%. They have a whole chart of how they mark it and it's quite complicated.",

After research on the acceptance proccess the school said: \"Ranking is based on the average of grade(s) submitted for the required subject(s) and/or the results of other published admission assessments. If a required final grade is outstanding when this program is ranked, the minimum acceptable grade score in the published requirements will be used.\". Would this mean that if I did badly on this test, it could potentially prevent me from getting into the pre-service? Based off that statement, it seems like a yes. It just doesn't seem right because people could've applied to the test with a worse average who didn't take the test and then it won't be applied to their acceptance. Just wondering if anyone has any potential insight, would appreciate it greatly.",

I don't see it as part of the reading study guide,  I really wish they would give you questions and answers that you will see in the chemistry biology and physics portion  other than what they provide in that course overview PDF.  I've just been studying the basic concepts for each subject, and I hope that's going to be enough.",

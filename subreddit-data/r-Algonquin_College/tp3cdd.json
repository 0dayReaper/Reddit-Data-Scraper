    "postText": "I am an International student who applied to Algonquin , Centennial , Humber and Sheridan for an Electrical Engineering program starting this September 2022. I have been accepted to all 4 and would like to know which one is best to go to. \n\nMy list preference so far from first to last :\n1. Algonquin \n2. Sheridan \n3. Centennial \n4. Humber \n\nFor Algonquin I have heard a lot about how great over there is from past students but with Sheridan they undeniably have the best  engineering specific facilities with state of the art ABB, CNC equipment and Magna partnerships. Can anyone from the colleges share their experiences and maybe give me your opinions on which to choose ? \n \nThanks!",

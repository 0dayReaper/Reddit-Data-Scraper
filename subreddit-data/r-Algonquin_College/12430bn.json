    "postText": "I wanted to start in fall 2023 in the aircraft maintenance engineering program, and if I don't like it head over to another school for an Apprenticeship in motorcycle maintenance. I thought the aircraft course would be a good starting place to see if I, for one like working on planes, and also like working in a shop. Is this a good idea? Any help would be awesome.",

            "comment": "im in the AME program and its amazing with lots if knowledge but i want you to keep in mind that its a serious program thats monitored by transport canada which means hours and averages are very important requirements due to the nature if the program/trade. miss too many hours it dont hand things in and youre set to restart that whole class. youre gunna be fixing airplanes with hundreds of people on them if that doesnt sit tight in your conscious that you may have dint something wrong and could crash the plane then its not the course for you. its not a play around and findout typa program. with motorcycles or cars the mechanic makes a mistake you can park on the toad side and call for assistance. if an AME makes a mistake theres no parking the plane on the next cloud you might kill 300+ people depending on the plane. that being said. its an AMAZING program thats in very high demand and super fun to learn something new literally every class with people straight out if the industry!",

They don\u2019t have nearly enough hands on way to much theory, I learned more in 2 months at my job then 2 years at that school on how to actually do maintenance practices. The instructors are cool people (Mark Ward) but talking to my buddies who went to other colleges it\u2019s embarrassing what they had compared to us.",

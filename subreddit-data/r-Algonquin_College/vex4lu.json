    "postText": "Hi \nI am planning to apply for animation course at Algonquin College.\nFrom what I have gathered the course seems work and assignment heavy. \n\nSince I'll be moving to Ottawa I'll have to manage my own expenses by doing a job.\nWhat I wanted to know is if the course is too hectic and can a student juggle a part time job and college simultaneously?\n\nAlso I read that the college asks you to buy art supplies and take printouts for assignments so  what other art supplies/books would be required for the course and what would be the approximate expenditure for supplies and assignments?\n\nIf anyone knows anything about it or have friends who did the course plz leave a comment.\n\nThanxxx",

I'm planning on waiting it out and just budgeting like crazy for a little bit as I see what the course load is like. as for supplies, we should be getting an email or something about supplies/textbooks in mid to late august about what we need specifically. we will be using toonboom harmony on macOS though, if that helps.",

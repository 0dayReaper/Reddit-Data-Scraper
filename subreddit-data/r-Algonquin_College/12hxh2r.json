    "postText": "Hey yall,\n\nI'm currently in the process of deciding if i\u2019ll be attending AC or Fanshawe for Medical Radiation.  I was wondering if I could have a little insight into both the program at AC and the residences, as I am required to move out (I live in Vaughan, 4.5 hours away)\n\nThank you! Any and all responses are greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I graduated a few years ago from the Algonquin MRT program! It's a great program but definitely competitive and high workload, the year I got in we had 900+ people apply and only 54 got accepted. Second and third semesters you'll be taking 10+ courses depending on electives, plus labs on top of that so it's a grind. The clinical placement is 12 months unpaid and you could be placed at an out of town hospital. It's really a lot of work but Algonquin prepares you really well for the actual job and for the national exam. There's tons of job opportunities once you graduate and I absolutely love my job now so it's worth all the hard work! \nI didn't stay on res so I can't comment on that. Good luck!",

I actually took two years off after highschool to work and travel a bit, then I did 1 year of university before deciding it wasn't what I wanted to do. I then applied to Algonquin so I still got into the MRT program based on my highschool grades but it was just a few years later :)",

I know for Fanshawe it\u2019s biology, chemistry,  physics, math and English with minimum of 70%. I didn\u2019t take physics in high school but I did do pre-health sciences certificate.",

They\u2019re both great programs, the pass rate for both programs with the CAMRT exam is 80%+ which is great, not all schools consistently have such a high pass rate. \n\nI do believe Algonquin has classes specifically catered to CT, whereas Fanshawe it\u2019s integrated into other classes. CT makes up a big enough portion of our licensing exam and if I\u2019m being honest it\u2019s not the easiest material so I appreciated that they were their own classes. \n\nClinical placements no matter where you go to school will be on a lottery, which means you can kinda be moved anywhere.",

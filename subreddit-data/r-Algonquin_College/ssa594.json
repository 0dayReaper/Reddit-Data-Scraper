I imagine that the program is even better now since it was relatively new when I took it a few years ago. Congrats on getting in!\ud83d\ude01",

When I did it, the first semester was the least hands on and more course heavy (the courses weren\u2019t too hard, more entry-level). It definitely got more fun for the rest of the semesters with labs and placements. I\u2019d say as long as you have an interest in the fields of PT/OT, you\u2019ll do great!",

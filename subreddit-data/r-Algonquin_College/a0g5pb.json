If you read your history and other posts it honestly sounds like your just bitter at Carleton because you aren't doing as well as you'd like to be doing. \n\nHaving done both my self the education I received at Carleton is far superior. PF at Algonquin was incredibly easy at times. 4.0 without attending a class. Just my two cents. ",

Also I failed LAWS 1000 because my prof was an unnecessary hardass and demanded every single thing be handed in; if you miss just one assignment, no matter how small, you fail right there.  Which isn't fair at all imo.  I had PMC documentation and everything and it meant nothing to them.  Failed because I missed one 15% paper and nothing else.  Horseshit imo.",

Yet you think it's fine if you just outright miss an assignment and feel you shouldn't fail? No offense but if you hate Carleton and the university system so much maybe you should just leave rather than continuosly shit talking and complaining on Reddit. ",

I did get a ton of transfer credits for the Bachelor of Barista program aka Psychology which was nice but...the classes were awful. Boring AF...so many students...little to no support...I did ask for help...no one seemed to care and they absolutely shat on my 4.0 college education. They tried to push me into another degree I didn\u2019t want. I left and said why am I paying THOUSANDS of dollars for this???? It was miserable. Personally, I knew pretty quickly I made a mistake but felt proud for at least trying. \n\nOnce I left,  not a single person from Carleton asked why. Like everything else, they are a business. Now I owe osap money for my short lived university career, but it\u2019s better than thousands upon thousands owed and being miserable. \n\nAlgonquin isn\u2019t always perfect, but the hands on experience counts for a lot more in my experiences. \n\nA degree isn\u2019t a guarantee for anything. And I\u2019ll be damned if I spend thousands on a degree just to end up at Starbucks anyways...degrees aren\u2019t what they used to be unless maybe you\u2019re in stem and then maybe I can see the argument. \n\n",

Although the class content is fantastic, I am having a tough time with 80% of my professors due to a lack of structure, organization, and passion. Out of 5 of my classes, I still have not received a single mark for 4 of them on Brightspace. This means I am not getting any feedback for any of the assignments so far.  It's almost December and I don't even know how I am doing mark wise which is an issue for most students in this program. On the other hand, my SO was in the XRay Tech program and her classes were structured well and she got feedback of how well she was doing on a bi-weekly basis (most likely because she requires it especially in the medical field).  I've graduated with a BComm degree from Guelph and had a much better time there than I am currently at Algonquin College.  Please do your research as much as you can before you decide to enroll in a program as I do not wish upon what I am feeling this past year to anyone.",

That\u2019s kind of tough if you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re passing your courses. I\u2019m doing business Admin and it\u2019s actually well structured. Just a couple of hits and misses with the professors. I use rate my professor sometimes to pick a course with a good teachers. It\u2019s not really reliable but it gives me a good idea on common problem students have with them.",

BUSI 3008 (Intermediate Managerial Accounting) is pretty similar to what was taught in the Managerial Accounting classes at Algonquin and BUSI 3007 (Auditing) is pretty much the exact same as well, minus using CaseWare. You have to take some first and second-year courses as well which is a little annoying (Psychology, Sociology, Linear Algebra, Managerial Economics, Entrepreneurship, Statistics II, and Organizational Behaviour). I find I am not getting as much useful information at Carleton U as I was at Algonquin, but it will be worth it for the degree in the end anyway. What I have gotten from my time at Carleton U is how to use databases (which you will too in BUSI4609 (Strategic Management)) and more knowledge on interpreting how to implement effective management control systems in BUSI 4008 (Advanced Management Accounting and Control). The difficulty of the coursework is really not very different from Algonquin either. Also, group work is just as bad, if not worse at Carleton U. I thought group members might be better and potentially more reliable at university but that is not the case.    ",

None of my appeals for new transfer credit get approved, none of my appeals for course overrides get approved and some of my legitimate accomodations from PMC have been thrown out by profs; I had no problem with the services at Algonquin.",

Algonquin was better in that it was miles cheaper for basically the same education and we had e-texts included in our tuition with the option to get discounted hard copy textbooks instead if we so desired.  It was also much easier for me to access mental health services etc at Algonquin and to get accommodations for deferrals, courses, etcetera.",

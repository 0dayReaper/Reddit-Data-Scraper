The charging stations can be found outside ACCE (CA Building)* and P Building with two spots at each building.\n\nYou may only park in front of the charging station while your car is charging. Monthly and annual permit holders can use the station at no charge for a maximum of 2 hours. If you do not have a permit, please use pay and display payment or Honk Mobile for a maximum of 2 hours.\u201d",

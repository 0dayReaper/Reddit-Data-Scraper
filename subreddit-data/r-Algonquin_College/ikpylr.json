    "postText": "*The goal: How to retain/comprehend more with less time spent (divided in 2 parts- concept learning &amp; memorization)*\n\n# Concept Learning\n\n***Learn by teaching*** *ie. rubber duck debugging, the Feynman technique*\n\n* Attempt to convey it clearly to someone else. Write down or verbally describe \\[to a friend- real or imagined, a wall, a teddy bear\\] the concept in the simplest terms possible.\n* Scrutinize it; make notes on the things you haven\u2019t covered, can\u2019t explain clearly, the \u2018how\u2019s and \u2018why\u2019s coming up you can\u2019t answer, etc.\n* Repeat until your explanation and conveyance is thorough and comes easily.\n\n***Practice information retrieval*** *This is a general skill that applies to both memorizing and concepts, but it\u2019s key for recall during tests and highly recommended by universities especially for exams, etc.*\n\n* Put the learning materials away. After \\[at least\\] an hour - write down/draw diagrams of everything you can think of on blank paper. (Take this opportunity to fill in gaps in your info.) Another way to practice information retrieval is by creating mini practice tests about what you learned the week before and swapping with classmates.\n* Do this once a week in various capacities to exercise the skill of recall, which is as important as memorizing the info itself.\n\n***Turn the abstract into concrete***\n\n* We remember things better when we take them from being abstract vocabulary and ideas and attach them to a concrete example.\n* Both the definition and the scenario are comprehensible, but one is generally more easy to visualize.  \nEg. \u2018Perpetual inventory system\u2019   \n*When described as a scenario:* \u201cWhen you buy something on Amazon, the warehouse computer automatically shows there\u2019s 1 less item to sell, and 1 more item to restock.\u201d *When described by definition:* \u201cA method of accounting for inventory that records the sale or purchase of inventory immediately through the use of computerized point-of-sale systems software.\u201d NOTE: You do want to be sure you memorize the formal definitions, too, but this helps for learning concepts more easily.\n\n***Prior to class: make outlines and understand objectives***\n\n* Determine the core learning objectives by familiarizing yourself with the chapter and the discussion questions before the lesson. *(Studies show students who read about the material before going to class retained more of the information they learned and were able to apply it better.)*\n* Highlight headlines and identify key concepts + areas you struggle with prior to class.\n\n***Ask the right questions when practicing these techniques***\n\n* First, read the discussion questions, understand the objectives.\n* Then when studying, write notes to compare and contrast, analyze, clarify, so that you\u2019re actively engaging with the material, ex:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does this happen and that doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the importance of\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the connection between?\u201d\n\n# Memorizing Techniques\n\n***Spaced repetition*** *whether via \\*Brainscape, flashcards, written notes, etc.*\n\n* Break your information into concise pieces\n* Review for less than 25 mins, going over harder material more often.\n* Review again **after an interval** of 20-60 mins, then use the forgetting curve to review again after an interval of 24 hours, then after 72 hours have passed, then a week, then 2 weeks, a month, etc. so things become rote by the time you need them (ie. midterms and final exams).\n\n*\\*Brainscape is a free website that allows you to build decks of flashcards. It then shows you what to review day-by-day based on your personal recall strengths/challenges and the overall human forgetting curve.*\n\n***Common mnemonics***\n\n* Create an acronym, or borrow one: \u201cDear King Philippe Came Over For Good Soup\u201d &gt; Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species is one used in biology.\n* Can be applied to rhyming and musical (like a commercial jingle) mnemonics. \n\n***Memory palace***\n\n* Have your grocery list, a paragraph, a set of flash cards, etc. in front of you.\n* Think of a place you\u2019re familiar with- a room, a house, a town, etc.\n* Plan out a route, thinking about each feature.\n* Take one or two items at a time; a sentence or sentence fragment if it\u2019s a literary article, parts of an equation if it\u2019s math, etc. and place them along your route.\n* Pair each item with an object, exaggerate it, interact with it- make it humorous, make it memorable. (Eg. if you\u2019re memorizing parts of an equation like &gt; \u201c2(x+3)=(4x-1)/2+7\u201d and the first image is of your front door- picture yourself solving the first part of the equation to enter the door, if you have a mirror to your left- picture it as blurry until you solve the next step, and so on.)\n\n***Miscellaneous***\n\n* When memorizing a specific set of information for an exam- try writing everything out you\u2019ll need to know in pencil and then erasing it as it becomes comfortably committed to memory/understood.\n* Check your concentration, esp with dense information, by stopping after every page to restate the main idea and sub points to yourself in your own words.\n* Keep a piece of scrap paper to your side- if something unrelated to study pops into your head, write it down and deal with it during an interval.\n* Pair your notes with images or diagrams so you have two points of reference for recall- think intently about how the image pertains to the information, reverse the process, then make your own doodle/diagram of the information.",

Every evening, I'd rewrite all my notes, a little more clearly/legibly. then I would highlight all the relevant points. Then I would make a list of the highlighted points on a separate study sheet. then I would make a mnemonic with the first words. and memorize that. and before finals, I'd just use the study notes.",

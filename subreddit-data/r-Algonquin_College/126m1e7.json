I ended up really sick with COVID and fell behind for a few weeks. They accommodated my assignments being handed in late. I\u2019m all caught up now. My profs and CAL have been very supportive in all of this. I faced horrible discrimination back in the mid 90s at Cambrian College and even overheard my prof speaking to another prof that she wanted me gone. She made my life absolutely miserable. Despite my good grades she refused to allow me to do my placement. I never returned to school for that reason until my current job no longer became feasible again due to a disability. I was nervous and reluctant to identify as a disabled student once again. I can truly say that I have received the best possible support as a disabled student at Algonquin College.",

Which is why I asked for literally any details of what is going on. \n\nAnd I'm not sure why you brought up trades. I'm not in the trades program. And at what point did I blame any victim?

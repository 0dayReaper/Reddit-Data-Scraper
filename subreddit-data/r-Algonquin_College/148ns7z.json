    "postText": "I applied to this program for the September 12th start. I was under the impression that this was supposed to be a year long, 2-term program. However I was just trying to apply for OSAP and the only option I can find with my start date is for a single term. Looking at the ACSIS website it states the term start and end dates as: 12-Sep-2023 to 19-Dec-2023. So...  \n\n\nQuestion #1 Do I need to apply for OSAP for both term 1 and then again later on for term 2?   \n\n\nQuestion #2 Am I mistaken about there being 2 terms???   \nOn the AC Online webside it states there are 7 level 1 classes and then 7 level 2 classes for this program. That is why I am under the assumption that level 1 is term 1 and level 2 would be term 2. Like, no way are they squeezing 14 classes into one single term, right?   \n\n\nQuestion #2 Has anybody recieved their welcome letters yet? After I paid my $500 fee last month I recieved an e-mail saying \"Congrats you've been confirmed, after your registration has been processed you will recieve a welcome letter containing all the information you need to get started.\"  \n\n\nThere's still 2 more months left until classes start so maybe I'm just being impatient and they are waiting until it's closer to the start of the semester to send out info. But I really hate feeling like I'm left in the dark.",

Since your program is two levels, you would submit now for the fall and again for the winter semester closer to.\n\nFrankly, I got my welcome package in the mail like a month before I started? It was very delayed. \n\nEach semester/level is 14 weeks. If ACSIS says you'll have 7 courses in the first level and in the second level, it means you'll have 7 courses from September to December, then 7 from January to April.",

Yes when I was applying to OSAP it stated my course was only 14 weeks and that's what made me so confused. \ud83d\ude43 \n\nMy ACSIS hasn't been updated with any more information yet but your reply has put me at ease for the meantime lol.\n\nDid your welcome letter tell you what books you'll need to order? Or should that pop up on ACSIS eventually as well?",

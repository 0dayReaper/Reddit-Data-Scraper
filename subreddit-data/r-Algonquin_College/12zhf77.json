I still don't have any concrete answers for this one since the guidelines don't necessarily explain what to do except contact your Program Administrator. \n\nI'd like to get some help in here or insights since I'm an international student too. \n\n\nThanks!",

As an intl student, you are fine as long as you don't need to renew your permit any time soon, and it's just one course you failed. If you can retake it in the summer, that would be great. That way, you don't need an extra semester for just one course.",

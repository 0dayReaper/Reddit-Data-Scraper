Looking around it seems like I don\u2019t have good chances to get a room if I\u2019m not below 50 on the waitlist. I\u2019m looking for someone who might have a room for me, or want share a rental with me, or be able to give me some advice on getting a room near the college. Thanks for any help you can give.",

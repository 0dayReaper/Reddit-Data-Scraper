    "postText": "Hi!  Am wondering...when you apply for the Animation program, does your portfolio need to be ready at that time?  For example, if I apply now (October), and I correct that I have until Feb 21 to submit my portfolio?  Is there a chance to find out acceptance prior to the portfolio being submitted (with the condition of it passing)?  Thanks!",

If you misread or decide not to do what is written then you are basically making it easy for the Coordinators to disqualify you. \n\nThe only reason I bring this up is because in the document it does answer your question:\n\"\nYou MUST apply to the program through the Ontario Colleges website by Feb. 1, 2023 in order to meet the equal consideration deadline. You will be notified if you have met the academic requirements, and then asked to submit a portfolio. You MUST submit your portfolio by the February 21, 2023 portfolio deadline if you wish to secure a spot in the program. After the February 21, 2023 portfolio deadline, we will continue to accept portfolios until the program is full.\n\"\nThe Fall semester intake gets filled up quickly and does tend to fill up quickly.",

I think what I was confused about was, can you get a conditional acceptance if you apply early before portfolio is submitted?  It appears that it is just notification that you met requirements and are able to actually continue application process with the portfolio.  Thanks again.",

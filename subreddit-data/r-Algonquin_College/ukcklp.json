Do we have to finish the program in exactly two years? By that i mean, if I have a slower progress, may I only take a couple of the courses? \n2. Is it possible to have a part-time job while taking the program? Or it will be hard to make my ends meet. :-(\n\nThank you!\n(Btw, what's the ratio for men and women in this program?)",

Would assume if you have access to reddit you'd have access to discord.  \n\n\nSecond, 1 You can do a reduced course load yes.  \n\n\n2 You can though depends on the job, location and timeframe.  \n\n\n3, generally more men than women, would say maybe for every 5 men there are 3 or 4 women. My classes were pretty well split",

I have to use VPN on my phone to get the access to Reddit and thought discord would be the same but it didn\u2019t work that way. Maybe because I don\u2019t have the discord app? The App Store doesn\u2019t have the app in my country.\n\nSounds like you are a current student in this program, may I ask which level you are at and how do you feel about this program?",

In person and online are very different, I prefer the commute of online but the atmosphere of in person.\n\nIt is important to get yourself a good study group, so don't be shy and talk to people about arranging one. A great resource would be the official discord of which I am a part of. We have some professors in there as well as more alumni and current students there who can help if you have questions. So would def suggest getting the app once you are over here.\n\nAs for the currentness of the program, it is a little old but generally thats because that's what the businesses use. They do try to update what they can though.\n\n\n\nAlso, I say the comment on job opportunities, I as well got a job right out of school due to this program so mileage will vary on that front",

However by doing this you will be unable to qualify for Co-op aspect of the program. \n\nYes I know for sure that it\u2019s possible to have a part time job and do this program at the same time. It may be challenging at time but it completely doable. \n\nWith regards to the ratio of men to women in the program. I\u2019m not sure. Sorry.",

I definitely need the co-op to get me started.\nI saw a CST related post on Reddit yesterday, the op said this program is outdated and it will hardly get someone a job, especially with limited jobs in the industry. Any thoughts on this post?\nTbh, I was so panic after seeing this post coz I\u2019m in my 30s and I do need to find a nice job to keep my life going.",

This \u201cout of date\u201d program, I say that this person has their opinion and I have my own. \n\nWith that being said. This program was recently updated and a lot of the core classes have been updated/changed. Furthermore you are now able to branch out into three separate job sector after completing the four levels of CST. They are Cloud Dev-op, Cloud Security and Data Management with focus on Azure AD.  Which is pretty cool. Plus the ability to do co-op alone is worth it. In today day and age, education mean nothing. It experience that everyone wants and plus if you are lucky you can get hired by your placement straight out of college or even during it. Like I did. \n\nSo no I don\u2019t think this program is a waste of time. However it is quite challenging at times. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a bird program where you can pass from doing nothing.  You need to apply yourself and it not worth you trying to go above and beyond the scope of the assignment either. In this industry, it all customers focus. Meaning if you are hire/told to do x, you do x and nothing more. Otherwise, you can risk everything and be fired. \n\nI hope this answer your questions and let me know if you have any more. Either here or shoot me a private message. I am always happy to answer them as best as I can.",

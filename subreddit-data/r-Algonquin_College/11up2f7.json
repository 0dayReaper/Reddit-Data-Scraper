    "postText": "I\u2019m applying to the pre health sciences pathway to advanced diplomas and degrees next year with the goal of getting into medical radiation technology after. I\u2019d love to hear the experiences of anyone who took the program. I\u2019m also curious about what average you had when you applied, if the program is competitive, if the content similar to high school, and if there are a certain amount of seats set aside specifically for pre health students in competitive programs. \nSince mrt is so competitive I\u2019m also going to apply to other schools (Fanshawe, Cambrian, confederation college) I\u2019ve heard that algonquins pre health grading system is recognized differently at other schools and there\u2019s a potential for your average to be lowered. Is that true and does anyone have any experience with that?",

The program is hard, it\u2019s a very heavy workload and they compare it to being halfway between high school and the competitive health science programs.\n\nI would recommend it if you haven\u2019t done the science courses in a while or aren\u2019t overly strong in them. You learn a ton. But this year, second semester specifically, felt very disorganized so be prepared to have strong time management! It\u2019s a great prep year if you want to get into MRT.",

Technically they designed prison buildings, but it was two years after they designed B building. \n\nThey designed some buildings for the Royal Ottawa which may have been controlled areas for exceptional mental health issues. \n\nThey designed CFB Cornwallis, which would have many characteristics of a prison as a restricted military base.\n\nThey designed a lot of public schools, churches, and government buildings which are basically the same thing as a prison. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Burgess#Burgess,_McLean_and_MacPhadyen_(1958-1967)\n\nMoney pls, they did design prison buildings.

You'd walk from the store, straight through the 4-way hall intersection, past the gym and through the doors at the end of the hall.  Take the stairs to the second floor, then immediately turn right and go through the set of big red doors.  Following that hallway will lead you to the pedestrian bridge across Woodroffe!\n\nI'm slightly ashamed to say that it took me till my second year to discover this, but it's super helpful.",

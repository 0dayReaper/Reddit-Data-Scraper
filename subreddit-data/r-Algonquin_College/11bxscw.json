We'll be filing an appeal to the Election Review Board with the help of a candidate.\n\nHere's a tweet thread about it:\n\n[https://twitter.com/HorizonAlgonClg/status/1629607431482294279](https://twitter.com/HorizonAlgonClg/status/1629607431482294279)",

Claiming this election undermines democracy is basically saying that all elections across Canada are rigged.\n\nSecondly, calling out the times? For real? The campaign period was 2 weeks long, which doesn't give a lot of time to cover each of the candidates without just copying what is on each candidate's messages that were sent out multiple times. Not to mention they're students as well, who have 6 other courses to work on, along with multiple stories they're already working on. Saying they're a mockery for not covering a quick election and questioning their integrity because they didn't have time to cover the election is flat out embarassing.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the winner is very dedicated to making a difference at the college, from representing their class and residence. They were also the only one to put up posters, and one of two candidates to make a video. Sucks that they didn't respond to your message, but I doubt this will make people work with you and your club in the future since you're just harassing the winner at this point.",

Rigging implies a malicious attempt to subvert democracy. So far, I haven't seen concrete evidence to suggest the College did this deliberately.\n\nThe Algonquin Times has shown a capability to cover College elections in the past as demonstrated here: [https://algonquintimes.com/news/new-representatives-to-join-board-of-governors-this-fall/](https://algonquintimes.com/news/new-representatives-to-join-board-of-governors-this-fall/)\n\nWhile I agree the election is so short that it makes it difficult to cover individual candidates, that doesn't mean they can't do a quick piece covering the election process and telling people where to vote, or announcing the winner once the election is over, neither of which they did.\n\nI hope Brandon does well as Student Governor, and that we can work together in the future. That's why I've intentionally not placed the blame on them in our posts. This isn't Brandon's fault. If our attempts at electoral reform and transparency are taken as harassment, then I promise you, that's not the intention behind this and I apologize.",

It isn't going to be posted immediately after the election since they find out the results at the same time as everyone else in the community. Journalism students had reading week off too. Also, the article you linked is about the winners in 2021, not the campaign process.\n\nAlso, you have attacked Brandon in your posts. Comments are posts too. You clearly said \"a majority of voters were in favour of progressive candidates, over 50%, and yet this didn't translate to an elected progressive.\" even though people have clarified they're a progressive candidate. \n\nYour endorsement didn't win, oh well. There's always next year. However, all you're doing is making it harder for your endorsement to win next election with posts like these, as well as putting your own name in a bad light.",

You're more than welcome to petition for ranked voting for next year, but undermining this year's election as a whole and the Algonquin Times is not a good look.",

I've been with the college for quite some time and historically the candidate who wins these elections is the one who advertises the most and can directly convince people to vote because voter turn out is always borderline nonexistent. From what I saw the candidate who won (who happens to be a progressive member of the queer community and a respected RA according to my friend in the Algonquin Times) was the only one with posters.\n\nFurthermore, what has the horizon club actually accomplished rather than try and sit into staff only meetings and wave your petitions around? While I agree that ranked voting would be beneficial in the future y'all have no idea how to operate as successful progressive political activists and are a disgrace to the actual Horizon Ottawa organization. \n\nYou're just mad your guy Peter lost. Go take a shower you always look greasy as hell \ud83e\udd2a",

Also does it really count as a loss if a majority of voters didn't want the declared winner to be their Student Governor, and voted for progressive candidates instead? We're not appealing the result of the election, but you can damn well bet we're gonna try and make sure something this undemocratic never happens again, and that the evidence is publicly available.\n\nEDIT: While I haven't personally verified it, people here have informed me that the winner was a progressive. We reached out to all candidates, but when people don't get back to us, and never list concrete policies, mistakes happen. My apologies for that.",

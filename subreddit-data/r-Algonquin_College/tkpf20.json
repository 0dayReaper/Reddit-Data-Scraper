Try with all your power to do homework and assignments AS SOON as they drop. \n\nGet help when you need it. Be quick with emails and with bugging your professors and lab instructors for help.\n\nBreak down assignments and give yourself deadlines to complete them. If you\u2019re stuck in one part, ask a friend or ask a prof ASAP. If you\u2019re still stuck, do as much as you can and forget the rest of the assignment. Don\u2019t spend hours and days stuck on a problem and miss doing work for your other classes.\n\nReach out and make friends from day one. Most of your help will come from fellow students.\n\nTransfer all your class deadlines from Brightspace to Outlook. Check your calendar often. Check your email every day.",

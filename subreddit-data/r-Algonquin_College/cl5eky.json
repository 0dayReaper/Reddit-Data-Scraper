That gives both the prof and students the time needed to get to their next class... and the next set of profs/students coming in the time to get set up.  It can be a bit tight if you're going from let's say... H to B but it can be done :p\n\n\nAlso changes are only possible if there is space available in the class you want to transfer into.  In popular programs often there is no space for movement because every section is maxed.",

Kind of bummed about this schedule, because it's really limiting if I ever want to leave Ottawa for a couple of days. \n\nAt least it's only a one year program.",

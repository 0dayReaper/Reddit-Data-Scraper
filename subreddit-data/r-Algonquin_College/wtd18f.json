    "postText": "Hey there! Is anyone else taking the Web Development &amp; Internet Applications online program this fall (2022)? I'm 28F and was hoping to meet some of you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nIt would be awesome to maybe start a group or a discord or something to keep in touch during the year. This isn't my first online program so I know how isolating it can feel.\n\nLooking forward to meeting you!\ud83d\ude01",

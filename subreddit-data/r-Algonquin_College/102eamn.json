Are there more options that are not mentioned? I am interested in programming more than sales and customer service representative.\n\n[co-op job titles](https://preview.redd.it/9dsuanqa7v9a1.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=da6261223bbe3ede0ee95d9b5a132a33ccc365d1)",

If you are wanting to be a programmer I would look for intern + { software or web developer/programmer, software engineer, front-end/backend/full stack software/web developer/programmer  }. Lots of different search terms. The search terms they provided don't really make sense to me for your program but I might be missing something.",

None of the job titles you listed sound like they will give you anything like what you're looking for, and in my opinion will actually prove to be a hinderance. Having a good co-op job that's relevant to the field and type of job you want is massively invaluable and can help get you there a lot faster, since having relevant experience under your belt will make you look a lot more attractive to prospective employers.",

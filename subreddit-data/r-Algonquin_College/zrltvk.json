Just fyi you\u2019ll only get a calculator for a few questions (I only got it for 3) so know how to multiply and divide by hand. \n\nFor chemistry know how to balance an equation, the types of reactions, oxidation/reduction, concentration, and calculating the number of atoms given the number of moles, electronegativity, pH\n\nFor bio know mitosis, meiosis, veins vs arteries, chambers of the heart, recessive vs dominant genes, punnet squares, sex-linked disorders\n\nFor physics know newtons laws, force, calculating speed of waves, torque, series circuits, velocity\n\nThat\u2019s about all I can remember! If you have any more questions feel free to ask me!",

I pretty much just took notes from all of these resources. I only studied 5 days for the test but I've done it before a few years ago and just finished the MRT program, so I already knew a lot of the information.",

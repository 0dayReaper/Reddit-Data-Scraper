    "postText": "Quick question, and I'll keep it brief. Whilst commiserating with an individual at my work about needing a change of career path, he highly suggested the CST program at Algonquin. \n\nLooking into it, it appears I need a number of highschool math credits to apply. I did not take math in gr.12, and as I am a 33yr old geezer, the gr.11 course needed for the gr.12 course is not even the same one we got when I was in school IIRC.\n\nI'm just curious if I do in fact need these to apply and be accepted, and if so whether anyone has any recommendations on where to take the courses from? Looking around online taking these courses appear to cost about $600 each?",

I think you could do it. \n\n\nIt\u2019s a two part exam, one covering arithmetics &amp; the other covering algebra.  They give us study guides / practice tests to study, which is what I used.

Using the Algonquin app, it says the total tuition for this program is going to end up being $8500. When talking to someone else, the seemed to feel this was conservative. They also said in the co-op version you get paid for the co-op so a lot of it pays itself.",

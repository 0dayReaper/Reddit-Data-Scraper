We'll be going through them together and planning meals and we're finally going to have this channel working the way I want it too. To show you a basket, plan meals do shows exicuting those meal plans and finally safety and storage of said meals. Woot I'm so excited the first basket shows up Feb 1st. \n\nhuge thanks to \n\nGrace \ud83d\udcf7 \n\nof the Lowertown Community House\n\n613-789-3930\n\n[https://crcbv.ca/programs-and-services/parents-babies-and-children/community-house](https://crcbv.ca/programs-and-services/parents-babies-and-children/community-house)",

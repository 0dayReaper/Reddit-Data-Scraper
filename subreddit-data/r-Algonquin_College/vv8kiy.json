There were some tech issues so we only just got access to mylab a few days ago. I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s better organized as I have no prior experience. So far, I\u2019m not a big fan of Pearson/Mylab. But maybe that\u2019s just because I don\u2019t like feeling like I don\u2019t 100% know what I\u2019m doing.",

What's fee credit in student account balance?\n2. How do I get my college email id ?\n3. What's bright space and am i supposed to create a login myself ?\n4. I got a network password but not a username... What exactly is that for ? \n\n\nThanks in advance for helping",

Fee credit normally means there is a credit meaning they owe you money.\n2. Your college email and password is in acsis on the top left hand side is a menu it will have network or email access\n3. Brightspace is the website used by the college the log in is your Algonquin email address and the network password in acsis you obtained \n4 the user name is your Algonquin email address",

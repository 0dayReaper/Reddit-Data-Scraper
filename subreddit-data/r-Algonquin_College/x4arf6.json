When you are there you will find Course Content Information or Course Section Information or named something else. Regardless it will have a layout of what to expect. \n\nThe layout will be broken down week by week. It will have information like what is due and when it is due. This will include projects, quizzes, midterms, and exams. I am sure I missed another form of assessment but you get the point. \n\nI actually recommend looking at all those documents and put that information on your personal calendar. This will help you avoid missing any assessment.\n\nGoodluck!",

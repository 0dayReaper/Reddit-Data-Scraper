Currently, I am using ***a 14\" Macbook Pro with an M1 Pro processor*** which I just bought 3 months ago, but the ***CPU only has 8 cores****, and* ***GPU has only 14 cores***. Both of them are lower than the minimum requirement which is a 10-core CPU and a 16-core GPU. Do I need to buy a new one or it is still acceptable? Thanks.",

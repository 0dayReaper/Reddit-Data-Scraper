What are the chances to be selected in either of the program? Am I too late? All of my documents would reach Ontario colleges by April. Though, I already applied for everything my mid Feb.",

You may have some chance of getting in through. If you haven\u2019t received an email saying you\u2019re waitlisted, check the portal. If you are waitlisted, you can call or email the registrar office to see your position on the waitlist",

An I missing something? \n\nThe program isn\u2019t competitive and intake is still available and not waitlisted for domestic students. I am a PR and waiting for my documents to reach Ontario colleges. Would I get an ACSIS account and credentials once they receive my documents and select me?",

Once you applied, they sent you an email from Algonquin saying \u201cwe received your application\u201d on that email is a student number. Scroll down and it\u2019ll say \u201ctrack application\u201d it\u2019ll take you to ACSIS which is Algonquin\u2019s portal. It\u2019ll tell you to make an account with your student number, all that good stuff. You can then track your application from there. You should\u2019ve gotten the email about 2 or 3 days after you applied depending on the day",

I have little experience in coding, outside of a few months coding online in my spare time, but I really enjoy it and am eager to learn. \n\nAnd although I'm in my mid 30s and wanting to get going on a second career, I also don't want to short change myself at school if the 3 year program is the \"superior\" program. \n\nJust looking for some advice/input from past grads, current students, and others who have gone down this rabbit hole. \n\nWhat are the main differences between these programs, in practical everyday terms, and is one superior to the other? Both have co-op. CP is 2 years, CET is 3.",

            "comment": "This is one of the most commonly questions asked in this subreddit, it seems.  Search for \"CET\" and you'll find some answers.  In short:\n\nBoth will teach you object-oriented programming and database stuff, and general foundational knowledge for your career.  CP focuses more on expanding that object-oriented programming, system design, design patterns, and more database exposure.  CET focuses more on lower level programming (C/C++/Assembly), compiler design, and some entry-level electrical engineering stuff.\n\nBoth programs are very much a \"you get out of it what you put into it\" operation: they're both a scratching of the surface of what you would do in the real world and relies on you to do a lot of your own research.  CET will give you more bang for your buck on the computer science level, and CP will get you programming for pay more quickly.\n\nTake co-op, the job experience is practically worth the entire thing.",

I've definitely read everything I can find in this sub, as well as Algonquin's Graduate Employment Report.\n\nThe thing that originally drew me to programming is that I have a love for creating and problem solving. They're in my nature. \n\nI'm curious what the real world application difference is between programming and com science. I've read a lot of vague generalizations, but not a practical, simple explanation of the difference/employment application and that's part of the reason I'm having a difficult time deciding.",

I've read a lot of vague generalizations, but not a practical, simple explanation of the difference and that's part of the reason I'm having a difficult time deciding.\n\nIt's hard to give you a good, clear answer because the disciplines of computer science and software engineering have become so intermarried.  Both of these programs ultimately want you to understand the gestalt of programming, that the language you're working in doesn't matter because you think and reason algorithmically, and can then translate that algorithm into whatever magic incantations the platform you're working on demands.  But you can't really get that unless you have a natural talent for it, or you write a fuckton of code.\n\nA lot of people in this field have strong opinions, so I'll give mine:  A focus on the concepts of computer science will help you think more like a computer, and that makes it easier to work closer to the metal.  If you like the idea of working on operating systems, drivers, integrated development like arduinos and robots and stuff like that, computer science helps with that and the CET program is basically a sampler platter for that sort of thing.  The high end of computer science which you will not get out of Algonquin alone leads to stuff like machine learning / AI, highly performant systems (fintech, DB design), compiler design, encryption / blockchain.. but if you are interested in that stuff and opt for the CP program which focuses more on how to architect your programs.. you can still grow into that understanding, because all that stuff is as much an engineering problem as it is a scientific problem.\n\nIf you have the time to do it AND you can deal with not being spoon-fed, CET is the better choice IMHO.  Ambitious software dev demands a lifestyle of learning, so you will only brush against many concepts you might want to explore once you graduate.  Also the CET program has you write a LOT of code, it can be quite overwhelming for some, but it is great practice.  If getting into the job market sooner is more important to you, then take CP - you are not losing out on anything in CET you can't pick up yourself later, if you have the drive to do it.",

I took a look at your post history real quickly to see if I could figure out where you're coming from career-wise, and see that you're looking to transition into government work.  CP program is more than enough to get hired into the IT stream, and if you get a government co-op and get stuff done while you're there it's a breeze to find an IT-01 bridge (unless you graduate during a freeze or some other nonsense lol)\n\nFWIW:  I was self-taught with 11 years in the field when I went to the Gonk to get my diploma so I could work for the feds, started in CET and transitioned to CP in level 3 to finish sooner.\n\nGood luck!",

Well, Graduated A+, C.N.E., M.C.P., M.C.S.E. and there's one more batch of letters after my name and I can't remember what the hell it is.. the calls and job offers were coming in like mad. Me and my Fellow graduate Mike Sladdin were up for the same job Systems Engineer for Netscape they offered three weeks training in Hawaii a bunggalow and car in silicon valley and a sallery to start at $98,000.00 per year. It came down to he was single I was married with kids so he got the job and I went with Compaq setting up there help desk call centers all over Canada and the U.S. at only $96,000.00 a year and no house or car but I got to travel all over canada and the U.S. business class all the way nice hotels good food. Some of the best stories of my life come from the 5 years I was there. Till one day I came home from Texas after a 3 month contract to find an eviction notice on the door of the house I thought I had paid for, and my wife and kids gone.  \nAfter a mad week of searching I finnally found them. Tracey and my three kids were living in a shelter for abused women and I was looked on like a monster even though I never did anything wrong, but I did understand when she finnally admitted to partying and gambleing all our money away and the lies she had to tell to get our kids in a safe place to live. Well the next few months were the begining of the end for me, my family  was falling apart my kids hardly knew who I was, my work suffered so much I was demoted to third level help desk. and I finnally snapped and ended up in the R.O.H. for a few months. With my severance pay from Compaq I got tracey and our kids a nice apt. got a devorce and opened \"Mad Hatter's Tattoos\" in Vanier. and for the next 15 years of my life I was happy, poor, starving most days but happy. Now my eyes are going and I live vicariously through my kids, My son Scott is a Tech like us he's the network engineer at C.M.H.A. (Canadian Mental Health Association) here in Ottawa my Daughter Robyn is in her last year of law school and works for ExCoppers (So,.. If you get a ticket... ) and my baby Kayla who hardly knew me at all is studying to be an accountant and talks to me everyday, we have breakfast together over messanger and I finnally get to be a Dad. Now I just do a little YouTube channel inspiering poor people how to cook well with what they got. \"Don's Empty Kitchen\" on YouTube.   \n I know i probably didn't help with your question but i hope i helped you to see that, what you do in life is not who you are, Canadians have a hard time making that distinction.. it's who you are that makes you a man, my son, not what you do.   \nAnyway thanks for listening to an old man, sorry for the spelling :)   \nDon (The Anti-Chef) Welbourne",

            "comment": "I am having the same problem as yours, my choices are CET-CS, CP and WebDev and MobileDev programs. And finally I decided to choose CET-CS, the 3 years engineer program. Right now i am a new immigrant still waiting my PR, then maybe go to college. I am 40 years old and I have more than 10 years experience at Enterprise IT service industry.\n\nI think the answers are different for each person base on their background and future plan.\n\nJan 16, 2023 Algonquin College had an Explore AC online event for computing related programs topic. There are lots of people were interesting in the same question as yours. The professor's answer, I remember, was: CP will focus on programming, then CET will focus on engineering.\n\nMy understanding about the diff between programming and engineering is like, programming will teach you how to use a specific tool to build a wall, but engineering will tell you how to start to design and build a house, by the best way, the most efficient way, and also there are some practice about the tools, and methods, more than what you learn from programming.\n\nCET-CS has some unique course: Calculus, Data Structures, Processor Architecture, C/C++/Java language, Compilers ... more than CP can teach you, and you will have chance to become a real engineer, I am not saying that CP students can absolutely not.\n\nThat is an imagination with a perfect result, as I know, even for those CS or EE university 4 years degree guys, not all of them, can totally learn to understand well and to use everything. There are lots of people would like to chose start from entry level, for example, from build a wall, different people has different way to learn..Or someone just want to find a job. \n\nAbout jobs, AC has some statics about graduates, CET and CP graduates seems have the same starting salary, but I am wondering how the salary data would be after 5 years or 10 years.\n\nI have a job description comes from Nokia Software Developer Co-op/Intern position. BTW, I have heard that Nokia will hire lots of co-op students from AC. It seems like it's an Enterprise IT service backend software automation test system developer job position.\n\n&gt;**Education Recommendations:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Currently a candidate for Bachelor\u2019s degree or diploma in Computer Science, Computer Systems Engineering or related field with an accredited school in Canada.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**What you will learn and contribute to:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Participating in an Agile team responsible for the specification, design, development and testing of the product.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Working with senior developers to put in place the automated procedures  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Writing and executing unit tests  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fixing defects  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**What is Nokia looking for You have:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Strong ability to learn new concepts and technology  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Working knowledge of Java and Javascript and unit tests automation tools (Junit, Jest)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Knowledge in Docker, OpenStack, Kubernetes, Helm, Containerized Applications, Microservices  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**It would be nice if you also had:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Good understanding of object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Excellent interpersonal/team skills\n\nIt is only one of them, there are a lot, with different requirements.\n\nBoth CP and CET can not cover all the requirements but CET will cover more. And you need to learn the rest part by yourself, if you would like to do a job like that.\n\nOr maybe you're interested in internet services or a government position, such as Shopify, CRA or somewhere else, I'm sure those have different requirements.\n\nYes, it is difficult to make the choice, maybe nobody can give you a total solution for you, except yourself, base on where you come from, where are you now and where are you going to. It's great to have a chance to discuss about this topic.\n\nGood luck.",

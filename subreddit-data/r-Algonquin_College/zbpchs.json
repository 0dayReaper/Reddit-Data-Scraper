I'm sitting here in a JAVA course where the module content is literally a single paragraph of text - watching hours of youtube and LinkedinLearning videos. How is this acceptable?",

I had expected some recorded lectures, but there's nothing of the sort. \n\nThe quality of facilitators varies a lot, too. Some really want to help you succeed and give you help and valuable feedback, and some appear to have only taken the job for a little extra cash. I have one facilitator who has not responded to a single discussion post on Brightspace and who does not offer any feedback on assignments, just a grade.\n\nMake sure to complete the course feedback!",

However, I am not able to get the refund as the university doesn't reply my mail back. Can anyone tell me whom should I talk to get the refund?\n\n*Thank you so much for your time!!!*",

Although, your program fee is refundable - I am pretty you did not pay your program fee yet because it is deferred until the class starts. Usually, if you look at your ACIS and go to \u201cbalance account\u201d \nyou will see a message: \u201c Your Refund Date for this program is (date here)\u201d and you can request your program fee refund.",

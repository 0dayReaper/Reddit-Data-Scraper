Even after asking if they're waiting for the group and they reply \"No\" they see nothing wrong with hogging the table.\n\nPlease, if you're one person, take one of the MANY single spots with power that are open. There are always plenty available, you don't need a whole room or 6 person table to yourself.\n",

I tended to prefer to study in quite, so I might not be as welcoming to a small group of students intending to do group work (especially when all the study areas in the current and nearby buildings are crowded), but I did my best not to have a \"do not apporch\" attitude / aura when I was studying.\n\nA single person hogging all the outlets and wired internet ports on a multi-person table is just rude and insensitive.  As is using-up most of the table space (unless needed due to working with large blueprints, making a presentation poster, etc.). ",

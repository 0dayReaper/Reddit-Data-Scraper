    "postText": "Hi everyone. \nI'm interested in starting a podcast or even YouTube channel or videos and basically have been trying to figure out how or where at Algonquin, as a student, I could record or produce/rent or use microphones/studio to record or make a podcast.  \n\nAny idea where I would start?\n\nAlso any interest in co-hosting?  \n\nI am an older Canadian male interested in starting a podcast(40). I'm in Business Program.  No particular subject; but I think looking as Canadian content, be it movies books or music or something more specific like Canadian Horror ect.  Maybe having a younger co-host to highlight the contrasts in younger/older oponions.  I don't know, but this post is the seeds of starting up something hopefully. \n\nCheers and I hope all your second semesters are going great!",

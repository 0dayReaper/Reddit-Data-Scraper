The program page mentions Work Integrated Learning- Field Projects, but I'm unsure if it's coop?\n- Is there any break in between the program? I'm interested in applying for Jan Intake. So does the program end in December or would end in August (8 months)?\n\nThank you )",

It has the \"Client Projects\" course where you'll work with real-world clients but it will still be in a classroom setting.\n\n\n**Is there any break in between the program? I'm interested in applying for Jan Intake. So does the program end in December or would end in August (8 months)?**\n&gt; There is a break of a few weeks between April and May but that's it. There's no standard semester long break like most other programs. So if you start in January, you graduate in August.",

What if I join another course in Sep which will end in April. Will I be eligible for 3 year work permit then or would both of the courses be treated as '8 month program'? \nThank you )",

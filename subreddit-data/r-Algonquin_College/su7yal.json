    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m just wondering if anyone took either of these programs with young children. I\u2019m not looking to apply until 2023 (I\u2019m still in school working on my undergraduate degree). I already know the programs are intense. I\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019s even  possible with a young child (my daughter will be almost 3 and I will have childcare arranged). Any thoughts or experiences welcome.",

It's a very busy program but it seems to be manageable for them so far. It's possible that labs will be in either the evening or morning and there are weekend labs as well, just so you know!",

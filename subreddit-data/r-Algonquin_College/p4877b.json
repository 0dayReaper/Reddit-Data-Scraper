    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello, this is Allen.   \nSome people might have heard of me from LinkedIn about my college story. \n\nI graduated Computer Programmer with co-op at Algonquin College in 2019 and wrote my journey on Medium. It consists of 6 stories based on the semesters - 4 study &amp; 2 co-op. You can get some idea of what you are going to learn and what it's like working as a co-op student. \n\nSemester 1/4 - [https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-1-6-e98f3d6e1caf](https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-1-6-e98f3d6e1caf)\n\nSemester 2/4 - [https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-2-6-23ee6bb4a038](https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-2-6-23ee6bb4a038)\n\nSemester 3/4 - [https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-3-6-eca730f24c3e](https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-3-6-eca730f24c3e)\n\nCo-op 1/2 - [https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-4-6-co-op-slide-b8237a211944](https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-4-6-co-op-slide-b8237a211944)\n\nCo-op 2/2 - [https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-5-6-co-op-nokia-7488a8f4e7c0](https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-5-6-co-op-nokia-7488a8f4e7c0)\n\nSemester 4/4 - [https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-6-6-last-semester-graduation-39d1c0f71a6](https://gooallen.medium.com/how-to-get-an-it-job-in-canada-college-stories-6-6-last-semester-graduation-39d1c0f71a6)\n\nI am currently working at one of automotive companies as a Software Test Engineer.

            "comment": "Thought I would put my 2 cents in the program too with similar experience:\n\nI finished EE at Uottawa before taking CP with no programming skills and no co-op. I almost hated EE at Uottawa cause the profs and teaching quality we got were absolutely garbage (You will never know how bad it is unless you were in it). But at least I finished it and I was stranded finding a job and some of you might know EE is the kinda program that looks amazing on paper but when it comes to finding a job it's almost as useless as an art degree in the current tech industry, but it was damn close enough to the truth, aka porgramming\n\nI was choosing between keep going for a master degree in some sort of engineering that I can get into or CP at Algonquin. The latter one definitely is a \"weird\" path to go for. No amazing looking paper creditential. But I knew what I was lacking, I knew what I needed: work experience, co-op. So I chose CP with one goal and one goal only, make good use of the co-op title I can get with CP. \n\nSo the story turned out good, CP is a great addition to my resume. I studied hard, harder than what I have back in university and it paid off. I got a co-op software engineer position at Ciena and got a full time offer before co-op even ended. \n\nWhile one of my classmates back in UOttawa with the same situation went for \"System science\" master's degree when I told him that you should seriously consider not wasting another 2 years studying useless crap just for a better looking piece of paper, he is still unemployed till today. Lesson is, sometimes you just gotta drop your ego and realized where you are at. It's not about what you have it's about what you know.\n\nPeople with similar experience like me, and desperate looking for a job, CP is great. Teaching quality wise, I have basically 0 complaint but that's just me suffered from Uottawa EE already.",

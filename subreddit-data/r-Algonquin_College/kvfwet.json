We both picked Gen1001 Ethics, and we are the only 2 in the class list. Has this ever happened to anyone? Also does anyone know what the minimum number of students is for a course to run? Thanks.",

There are still a lot of students needing to register for their gen-eds so it's always anticipated that this number will go up. If it does get to the point where there aren't enough students, your section will likely be combined with another section of the same course. \n\nFor your other question, there is a minimum number of students that have to be registered for a course but there are a number of factors that determines this number so it varies from course to course.",

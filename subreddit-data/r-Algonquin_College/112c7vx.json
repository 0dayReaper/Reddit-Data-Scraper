    "postText": "I'm currently in a bachelor program and am supposed to go on a coop term this summer but have not managed to secure a position. Most jobs are already filled by now and I'm really nervous. If I cant find a job by the end of this term, will I be removed from the coop program because I will have 2 more coop terms after this? Will my study schedule be the same or I'll have to study this summer instead and switch coop to fall term?\n\nHas this happened to anyone?",

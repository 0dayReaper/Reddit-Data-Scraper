I\u2019m looking for jobs and I\u2019m disgusted by the requirements for level entry jobs. 2 -5 years experience then anything to do with accounting they want certifications so I pretty much wasted 25k to become a secretary with all my skills did I mention I was a honour student as well.",

Maybe you are starting off with a job unrelated to your field right now, but you never know how these stepping stones can leverage you into something more related to what you wanted initially. I have heard many wonderful stories where people are gradually led to their dream job after some extra hard work. Welcome these baby steps with open arms and cherish them because they may open doors in the future. Stay hopeful, OP! Maybe you can gain new transferable skills from this job that come handy for a job that is more related to what you studied for in the future. It\u2019s all about wordplay on your resume to demonstrate your skills at the end of the day.",

I\u2019m graduating from a Business Administration core accounting major, and I have been applying for any job in the accounting field, but no one has replied. I sooo regretted wasting 3 years in the third program and money. I wish I have done something with trades instead of this nonsense. I would have been hired faster! I'm speechless",

I had a very similar experience when I finished school and moved to Ottawa in 2020 (I understand the job market is vastly different today). After about a year of applying to jobs, I landed a job that \"required\" 3-5 years of experience. After sticking around at that job for a year and a half, I now work in a position that \"required\" 5-10 years of experience. Just keep applying. You'll start getting interviews for some of the positions that you never expected to hear back from.",

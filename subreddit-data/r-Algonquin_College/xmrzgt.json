            "comment": "In the program currently, second semester, in co-op search term now. \n\nIf you have the experience and knowledge to write your PMP right now, go for it. Many of us in the program are working towards the goal of earning the education experience required for CAPM and then the PMP. With co-op the aim is to get your foot in the door with local companies/gov\u2019t. \n\nAdditionally, the co-op dept stated that if you receive a job offer while studying they recommend going for that rather than staying in co-op. One of my classmates was able to network and secure a job (about 4 weeks ago) and has since left the program to pursue that full time opportunity. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m getting at is: if you\u2019re able to certify, do that and start job hunting, if not/you want the in-class learning experience, then take the PMGC program. \n\nFeel free to DM me and I can answer some more questions if you like.",

You\u2019ll probably be eligible by the end of your first semester. \n\nIt\u2019ll then be a few years until you\u2019re PMP eligible (5 years PM work experience is required). \n\nEither way I personally find it a rewarding program. My class is a really diverse group of people with so many differing education/work/age/life experiences so you get to make good connections with many people who will ultimately be PMs but in different fields.",

I\u2019m personally on a LOA from my job so I have plenty of time to do my work. Classmates who have jobs are making it work, they just have to dedicate more of their downtime to completing class work. \n\nIt comes down to your time management/prioritization style. If you avoid procrastination you\u2019ll be ahead of the game already.\n\nIt\u2019s very team focused work (which is par for the field of PM) so you\u2019ll be collaborating with team members often to complete different deliverables. If you do have a job that will introduce some complexities in your team meetings/scheduling but I\u2019ve been on a team with three other folks working concurrently and we were quite successful.",

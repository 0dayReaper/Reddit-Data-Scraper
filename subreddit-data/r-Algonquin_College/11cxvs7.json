(due date I believe is May or June?)\n\nHowever, I haven't received any update from a college (It's been 3 weeks) and I got another offer for the program I already declined a few days after I accepted the program.\n\nWhen I checked the school website, and ontariocollege website,\n\nIt seemed that status has been updated.\n\nIs there anything I have to do after I selected program though the ontariocollege website?",

            "comment": "I don't think so. I was confused as well so I sent out some emails and in response I was told that my acceptance is \"final\" and that I'll just need to pay the $500 fee before June something to secure my seat (full tuition deposit isn't due until 2 weeks after the 1st semester starts, as far as I understand).\n\nHonestly though so far communication from this college is really lacking. I'm still left with more questions than answers.  \n\nGood luck to us both!",

If you're less than patient, try calling the registrar's office. At the very least, they can confirm when the deposit is due.\n\nCongratulations!!!",

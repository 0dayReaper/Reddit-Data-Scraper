    "postText": "Am I alone on this? \n\nI graduated from high school 3 years ago now. And to be honest, in those three years, I've been distancing myself from people I knew in high school.  I feel like my relationships from high school are more toxic than they are beneficial at this point. \n\nI started college in the fall but hanged programs for the winter semester and I was hoping for an experience where I'd get to meet new people with who I actually have things in common. I was hoping this would be an opportunity and experience to meet people and friends and it just isn't happening with everything being online. And with my best friend and my family moving away, I've been really lonely. And I just wanna know if I'm the only person kind of feeling like that?\n\nAny advice on how to connect with more people? I feel really isolated and have been feeling more socially anxious as this has been going on.\n\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your advice.  It was very helpful and I did start to connect to some of my classmates. However, I ended up leaving the program because it really wasn't for me. I plan on going back to school next fall and taking some time to figure out what I want and just working too. I'm going to make a better effort to be friends with my coworkers.",

I know it isn\u2019t the same as meeting people in person, but someone had started a discord for our online program and I have definitely made connections through that. Take your program seriously, work hard, and make study groups or engage with people by helping/working together. I\u2019m in my 30s and thought I hadn\u2019t enjoyed chatting online since the MSN days, but I really enjoyed being in the discord group, especially considering I had assumed studying online would be a lonely experience. Having a common goal really helped break the ice.",

I think the advice of turning on your camera is very good and honestly hang in there... Probably the latter courses in your program will focus more on group assignments and those are a pretty good opportunity to make friends... Making friends online is tough for you and for everyone... But hey kudos to you for speaking about it.",

Most of us are doing recruitment right now, so it\u2019s the perfect time to come out to some low pressure events, meet some people, and get a feel for Greek Life. Even if you ultimately decide joining isn\u2019t for you, you\u2019ll still get to meet some awesome people and get out of your comfort zone a little! \n\nYou\u2019re free to message me about it, I\u2019m happy to point you in the direction of any organization, or connect you with a member or two \u263a\ufe0f",

Pick one that interests you,  put a little time in and at least you'll know that the rest of the people involved in that charity at least share some of your interests.  It really helped expand my social circle in a time when it's just been pushed to the side",

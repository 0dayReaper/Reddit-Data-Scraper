You showed up whenever and just walked around to each of the tables, where a representative would tell you a little about their program and the requirements to get in.\n\nI can't remember if there was any kind of tour or not. If there is, they'll likely just be showing off the classrooms for the trade programs (not what I was interested in/ended up taking), as everything else is just, you know, classrooms.\n\nYou're completely free to walk around the college on your own; it's open to the public seven days a week, and students are always there studying on the weekend.\n\nEdit: typos",

                    "comment": "The above is still correct. If you are interested in a program that requires particular labs I would recommend reaching out to the Coordinator to set up a time to walk around with you. Programs like Film and Media Production, Broadcast Radio, Computer Programming, etc. Only because without the proper access you may be able to see inside the lab through the window but you can't see much. \n\nA tour with the coordinator will allow you to see the full lab in detail. But the best part is the coordinator will talk to you about what you should know about the program, how it runs and what to actually expect not just what is written on the website. \n\nAsk away even after you leave the open house. They want to make sure you join a program you like and you will succeed.\nGoodLuck",

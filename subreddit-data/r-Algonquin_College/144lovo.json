I was fortunate enough to get a room right away, but my friend was number 180 and didn\u2019t get a room until the end of the first semester, and at that point she already had an apartment and what not. \n\nI would look into off campus housing. Facebook has a group for housing for students at Algonquin and everyone posts looking for roommates often!",

    "postText": "Hey all, as the title suggests I have a couple of questions about the sonography programs at Algonquin college as I'm planning on applying in the coming months. I am a senior Biology undergrad student at Trent university and I will be graduating this coming summer. I will have an honors bachelor's in Biology once I'm done and realistically my average will be around 75-80. I am wondering if my undergrad or grades will give me a decent shot at admission into the program with no medical background, as well as how competitive the program is. I will be taking CPR courses this summer as well and am extremely interested primarily in the cardiac stream of sonography. Any insight would be much appreciated!",

            "comment": "Application into any program is based on first apply first get in, not the same ring to it. Your background does not get taken into consideration when you are applying to any program unless the background is a program requirement. \n\nWhen you go to the Program Website under \"Availability\" you will see when the program starts, it's status (open, wait listed, closed), and if the program is competitive. \n\nAny program that is labeled as competitive means that a lot of people apply for it. So what Colleges, all of them, do is they place that marker on it and give students two options. You either apply before the \"Equal Consideration Deadline\", Feb 11, 2023 or you apply after. If you apply before you will have an equal chance as the next person that applies, that's where first come first serve comes into play. Apply after that date the school will have the right to pick from the group of students that meet the program requirements that have applied. \n\nI hope that helps. Also keep in mind Fall 2023 application opened on October 1, 2022. You can apply while not having all the requirements and still get accepted. This acceptance will be a condition acceptance. \n\nGoodLuck",

            "comment": "The DMS program is pretty competitive. They get hundreds of applications and accept 20-30 students each year. It's widely based on the ac hpat scores though so it's worth applying to for sure. I'm in DMS and it's a good program. One thing I wanted to say was you don't need the CPR for the application. You actually won't need it until you start clinicals if you do get in, so I wouldn't necessarily worry about getting that done because it will need to be repeated again before clinical. It has to be updated every year",

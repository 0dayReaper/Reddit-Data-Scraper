    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am considering applying for one of these two paralegal programs at Algonquin and I would appreciate it if you help me with these questions.\n\nhttps://algonquinacademy.com/programs/law/paralegal\n\nhttps://www.algonquincollege.com/business/program/paralegal-graduate-certificate/#courses\n\n1. Does it matter if I get a diploma or a certificate \u2014 in terms of employment / getting a license?\n2. What is the typical schedule of these programs? When do the classes usually start? How often are students expected to be on campus?\n3. Can you share anything about the quality of either of these programs / your experience after graduating / difficulty level / any other aspects?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hey I took the paralegal program at Algonquin College a few years ago. One thing to point out is that Algonquin College and Algonquin Career Academy ARE NOT AFFILIATED TO EACH OTHER. These are 2 different institutions and one is an actual college and the other is in a strip mall beside a Value Village. \n\nTo answer your questions:\n1. Both programs seem to be accredited by the Law Society of Ontario so it probably doesn't matter too much but you would probably have a better learning experience at the College.\n2. When I took the program, it was full-time studies with classes at different times throughout the day (classes can start as early as 8am and go as late as 10pm I think). Might be different after COVID so you likely want to email the coordinator to find out more.\n3. The program at the College was fine. The professors are actual lawyers or paralegals and they coordinate your field placement for you. You may have difficulty finding a job as a paralegal afterwards but the job I have now with the federal government draws a lot of knowledge from my paralegal studies.\n\nI hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Take Law Clerk Diploma, then Paralegal as the Graduate Certificate. Search this sub as others have shared the course load and intensity. Don't forget, Licensed Paralegals must qualify through the law society. Education + license exam + O&amp;E insurance + Yearly License.",

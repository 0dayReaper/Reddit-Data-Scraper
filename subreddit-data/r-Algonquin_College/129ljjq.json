    "postText": "Hi all,\nI\u2019ll be a student of Office Administration (online) program this summer and I want to hear your experience in buying textbooks and arranging school schedule around work.\nI\u2019m working full-time and being paid only little bit above minimum wage range so I wonder is there any way that you can do to save money on buying textbooks? Are they mandatory for all classes? \n\nI also would love to know how many days a week that classes will take place, do they do evening classes? I work office job on weekdays and I really want to keep at least one to two days a week, if not I\u2019ll struggle to get by (my OSAP will be just enough for school and rent).\nAny input is appreciated!",

            "comment": "The online program doesn't have scheduled class times, you're given access to lessons in Brightspace and each class provides project deadlines for the whole semester at once; you work at your own pace.\n\nAside from one class (I think it was interpersonal relations?) there was very limited group work. Other than depending on quality discussion posts to participate in the regular discussions. If everyone posted last minute it limited when you could complete your designated # of replies. I also personally didn't touch the textbook for that class, as there was no exam and the lessons in Brightspace contained enough info to get by each week. But I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.\n\nSome of the other textbooks are 100% necessary though, because they come with codes to access digital content. For level 1 that might just be Document Production, but it's been long enough I'd have to double check exactly which classes were part of which level.",

                            "comment": "During level 2 I actually never even opened my Word Processing textbook. It was too similar to Document Production to be necessary, and I still got an A. If you're familiar with Microsoft Word at all you won't need it. I googled my way through obstacles lol. \n\nHowever for Document Production I and II you get participation marks for completing the lesson modules between exams. (Mostly touch typing/ WPM tests at first, then Microsoft Word document editing modules). Those textbooks come with the Cengage digital access codes and you will 100% need them. I preferred the physical textbook, but there are ebook options too. I got the physical book for level one and ebook for level 2. \n\nI'm just rambling now lol. It's been almost a year now and I've forgotten a lot, but if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.",

I applied in first of February, after I pay around $100+ and have them accepted my transcript they sent me a confirmation via email within a week (I paid $500 only when I withdrew which hurt I should\u2019ve known lol). As long as you have an offer confirmation you\u2019re good. My letter came in around mid Feb. They\u2019re usually slow due to high volumes of emails so I\u2019d suggest u to give them a call. When I called in the morning it usually works. If not just send them an email around June. For OSAP application you can ask their Financial Aid team they will help you either via email or fone (I was panicked so I reached out to them a lot). But its actually still early for your program, you usually can sort things out around two months before the start date. For textbooks you can also check on reddit (I remember someone from the school commented about it before)",

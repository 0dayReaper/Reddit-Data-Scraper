    "postText": "So I got into Strategic Global Business Management course at Algonquin(international student), and noticed that the offer letter mentions about unpaid work as noted below-\n program has an unpaid work requirement (field or work placement). Please note that this is NOT a co-op program.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea details about the same? I\u2019m confused as they mention that it is not a co-op program.",

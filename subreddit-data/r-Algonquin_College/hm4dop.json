    "postText": "I will try to keep the story short and precise:\nI am in level 2 computer programmer and our prof is the infamous Dave Houtman if anybody knows this name. This guy is known for his strict policies on code plagiarism. He expects you to quote things that you got off the Internet. So I did for a recent lab assignment. For anyone that knows Java, I quoted \"Math.sqrt()\" off google purely cause I don't know the syntax and he never mentioned or taught in class. The searching took me 5 sec to glance through the syntax and nothing really complicated here. Later on in the assignment feedback section he literally wrote: Suggestion: \"quit using geek for geeks and start using your brain\", does this sounds right to you? To me it sounds like I am a no-brainer and should stop googling things that he didn't teach (which makes 0 sense) I have been through University education and I know how unfair a prof can be but this is the first time personally encountering some unprofessional behavior like this. It's not cause he hurt my ego or something, it's cause as a teacher you shouldn't say that for the first place to your students especially when it comes to me following my honesty and cited things properly. But instead, you used it to to mock me? Anyways, I already wrote a complaint letter to both acedemic advisors and program chair with screenshot proofs. Does anyone know some other departments I can write to as well? I am not gonna let this go easily because I have plenty time to deal with this.\n\nedit: Academic chair acknowledged this, I encourage everyone that was treated badly by this prof to speak out. I am now waiting for a resolve and we will see what school will do.",

Some people think that making things short and try to optimize everything is smart but no, In some situation, you have to break things down to make it easier for other people to read and easier to maintain.\n\nHe was not technically right, also it is insulting and unprofessional. I don't think you did anything wrong with searching the solution, it's a Library that you haven't learn; you have already cited everything. I'm working as a developer and to be honest, I couldn't even remember all of the syntax, libaries, etc. and going through geek for geeks, w3school, etc. everyday at work is normal.

Verbally, fine, I might say something back directly to remind them but here cause covid, he left his words by typing which is even worse. Typing all these words definitely worth the effort for him.",

He laughed at my code and said this a kid could write even though it was working. He deleted all my files and said to write it again if I wish to get points. He is the worst. Now I have only one day to write the whole code again. I spend days writing it before. Please anyone who has the class right now help me with the assignment otherwise he will fail me. I just want to scootch through his class.",

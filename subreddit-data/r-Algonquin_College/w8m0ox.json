    "postText": "Hi guys, I am a returning student to Algonquin, it's been a couple years since my last program and I was wondering about access to my school email. I had assumed that the email I had used in previous years would still be the one I use now but when I try to reset the password it says the email does not exist.\n\nThe network account info section of ACSIS shows the email I've used in previous years but it still doesn't seem to work. Who would I contact about this?",

            "comment": "Prof here.  Trying to juggle work and school can be rough.  Colleges expect you to prioritize them over almost all other commitments.  When you are trying to pay rent, food, gatcha addiction,etc. it may seem that the school does not care... and it does and doesn't.  The expectation is that you attend all classes as schedule and work the rest of your life around that.  This is not always an easy thing to do.  Now to actually answer you question, kind of.\n\nIt depends on the prof.  Some profs do not record their lectures and often there are things said that aren't written down that will show up on tests/assignments.  Other profs record their lectures and post them promptly so you are at least able to watch the lectures on your own time.\n\nWe can use the Zoom reports to \"take attendance\".  It tells us who connected and for how long (info for all of those reading this comment who do the good old connect, wait 5 minutes and bail thing so that they \"attended\" class).\n\nThe big question will be whether or not your profs will tolerate that behavior.  If you don't attend lectures/labs and you submit decent/above average work the suspicion of cheating starts to spike and you will likely be put under scrutiny.  I have had a few students who were MIA for most of the term and submitted above average work.  It was a major PITA b/c I had to investigate each one and try to figure out if they were doing the work themselves or doing the Discord special where they grabbed all of the comments about a particular assessment and built it from that.\n\nMy only real advice is to reach out to each prof and ask what they feel about it.",

            "comment": "One of the profs refuses to record any of his lectures and he also runs a one question \u2018quiz\u2019 at the beginning of the class to ensure all the students are present.\nHe refused to record his lectures to accommodate international students that were still in their home country and had to be awake at 3:00 am to be present . We believe the real reason to his refusal to record was that he\u2019s such a terrible prof that he didn\u2019t want proof out there. Other profs have no issues recording. \nGiven that many students are \u2018mature\u2019 with families, it makes it hard if the lectures are not recorded.  Not to mention, that it helps review things that were not clear during the lecture.",

I participate to all the classes but half my classmates don't and they can still get pretty good marks. I don't want a bunch of clowns with a diploma where they learned nothing except how to do well on all the open book quizzes etc.  A whole 2 year program paying in person prices but getting a correspondence education.",

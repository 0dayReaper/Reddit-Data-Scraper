    "postText": "I\u2019ve gotten into the illustration program for winter 2023, and they haven\u2019t posted the time tables yet (I think I saw the date for that is in a couple weeks) but I was wondering a couple things:\n1. Do they typically schedule courses on the same day as much as possible? I\u2019ll be commuting to campus and am hoping I won\u2019t have to go every single day of the week \n2. Are any courses online? My program is in person but I know some schools are hosting larger classes online and smaller ones in person, so I\u2019m wondering if Algonquin is doing something similar",

I hated my original schedule for fall asked fellow students what they were getting and switched sections so my schedule changed a lot and so did my profs. But for 5 classes, I\u2019m still commuting to campus 4 days a week, though the times are improved. \n\nStay vigilant and inquire as much as possible!",

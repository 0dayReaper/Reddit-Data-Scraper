    "postText": "But seriously, I'm curious about the job opportunities after Algonquin animation. I've heard good things about the program, but do the students get ahead after it? Do some of them go on to work at big studios like Disney, Pixar or Titmouse? Are there any recognizable alumni?\n\nI know Sheridan provides those opportunities but it's extremely difficult to fund as an international student. Is Algonquin a good option in that regard?",

            "comment": "tl;dr Yes but you need to put in the work to make your portfolio look good, network, etc.\n\nBut if you're an international student, good luck because most animation houses need you to be a citizen/permanent resident of the province they operate in.\n\nHilda has a lot of alumni working on it. And an alumni turned prof IIRC.",

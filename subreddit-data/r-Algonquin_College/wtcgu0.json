You will be given lots of useful information regarding your program and how best to get ready for the semester. They will answer any questions you have about the program as well, questions regarding; co-op, textbooks, and other smaller details. \n\nOn top of that AC Day 1 is like a fair. There will be food and some fun activities usually hosted by the Student Association. \n\nGoodluck!",

From that I would recommend going to it and staying a bit after or coming a bit before for the activities. The most important item you need to be present for is the orientation. Past that you would be there for enjoyment so you can leave any time you feel comfortable to leave.",

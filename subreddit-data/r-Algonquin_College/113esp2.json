            "comment": "Hey there , I am a cardiovascular tech student . The program is definitely a bit challenging at first but it is rewarding . As for schedules, level 1 students usually have to attend classes 5 days a week and it\u2019s 1-2  classes a day with one lab class (mine was on Thursday ) . Level 2 students will be divided into groups and have thier labs at separate days so the schedule differ from one student to another . However classes are somewhat long in level 2 . Let me know if u have anymore questions",

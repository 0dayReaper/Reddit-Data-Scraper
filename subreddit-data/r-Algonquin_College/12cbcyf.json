    "postText": "Hi everyone, My name is Himanshu Sharma and I am taking admission in Algonquin College for Computer Programing diploma (Fall Intake). My question is, I want to send my fee through Flywire but for some reason I cant send it in one transaction. So can I send my fee in two payments? My total fee is $17,900, so can I send it with one transaction of 10k and second transaction of 7.9k? Please reply if you're sure about it. Thank you.",

    "postText": "Is anyone interested in being a subject in a documentary style assignment that me and the other TV Broadcasting students have been assigned? We are required to film a story about current Algonquin students who have been affected by the pandemic and have had to make changes to their everyday life. \n\nIt will involve a group of us TV students coming to you with a bunch of film equipment and telling your story through videos and interviews. \n\nPosting on here because it\u2019s hard to bump into people in other programs while we\u2019re doing online learning.\n\nMessage me on here if you\u2019re interested in helping out. Thanks in advance.",

    "postText": "I am looking for someone to take over my lease until December, or for a sublet short term!- You would take over my last month's rent deposit if you choose to takeover my lease and get December free! The room is on the second floor of the building, it comes with a bed and mattress with protector, desk, wall mounted tv, closet, dresser, and nightstand. The unit is renovated and has AC. The kitchen is also newly renovated and includes a dishwasher and various appliances, including an air fryer and food processor. If you commute, the bus stop is immediately outside the building and will take you to Algonquin campus in 14 minutes. If you drive, parking is available but they will assign you a parking spot. Roommates are all female students and really nice and quiet! Pet Friendly! I am leaving Ottawa to pursue a different program. Please contact me at cindysecond2@gmail.com if you're interested or would like to see the unit! The room will be available start of April.\nhttps://youtu.be/daUE42KDoSU",

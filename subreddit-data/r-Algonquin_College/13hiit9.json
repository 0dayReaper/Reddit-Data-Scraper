    "postText": "I've been trying to look for rent online because I am joining the college in fall 2023, but everything online is a scam or expensive.\n\nFrom what I know most student graduating this year in this fall term are expected to leave the college in October so I guess that will give an opportunity for futures arrivant to do in person visits.\n\nSo should I look for rent in advance or till I come to ottawa?\n\nIf it's the second option what do you suggest for a short term renting option?\n\nI want to have some informations about rentals in Ottawa and any suggestion I can need in the future.\n\nI want to know also a reasonable range of price in nepean area, how to proceed with them, \n\nWe are 3 old friends who will be reunited in there is it possible if we could rent just a 2 bedroom house as it will be a cheaper option for us?\n\nThak you for your time.",

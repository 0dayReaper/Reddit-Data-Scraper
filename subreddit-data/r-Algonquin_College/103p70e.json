    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to make my decision for what college I\u2019ll attend in the fall. I\u2019m deciding between the general business program at Fanshawe and Algonquin. I have a few questions about Algonquin I haven\u2019t been able to find much about on the thread: \n\nWhat is the general business program like?\n\nWas it easy to meet people there?\n\nWas there opportunities for study groups &amp; after hours from professors?\n\nWas there any night life at the college?\n\nThank you",

            "comment": "I graduated from a similar school of study in the advertising and marketing program a few years ago and took some of the general business courses along the way. I found meeting people was incredibly easy at all levels of Algonquin :) everyone is really chill and as long as you\u2019re just yourself people gravitate to that immediately! Group work is also a key part of the program as most classes consist of smaller group assignments throughout the semester leading up to one large final assignment or presentation in place of an exam. Profs are amazing too! They really care so much about the students and they get to know you as much as you know them, and classes are relatively small (40-50 people), so it\u2019s inevitable they\u2019ll learn your name, learning goals, career goals, etc. and help you work to achieve them. Night life however can be hit or miss, if you plan on staying in residence you\u2019ll find that area of the city is more campus and strip mall focused, whereas downtown (about 15 minute buseide) is where a stronger night life can be found. If you have anymore questions, please DM me! I loved my time on campus and am happy to help if I can",

I\u2019m completing a dual diploma so my second major is Accounting. I will agree that the profs do care and listen to you and your goals and they help you reach them. Student life is pretty amazing as we are all returned to campus I think all of us are looking to connect with others. If you want hit me up",

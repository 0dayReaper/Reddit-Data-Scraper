    "postText": "I am in international student enrolling into Algonquin College for Spring 2022. \nI've always loved Physics mainly but also enjoyed the IT(Information Technology) classes during my highschool years. I have good grades in both the subjects. However I have no prior programming experience except some basic in Html and Qbasics(which I have also loved learning)\nAfter debating and researching, I have applied for an Advanced diploma in the Mechanical Engineering Technology program and picked Computer Engineering Technology as my second choice. \nAfter some more research, I've now learnt that the job prospect (especially as an international) is very low for Mechanical in comparison to Computer Engineering\n1) I would like to know from graduates of the programs if this is true?\n2) And if so would recommend switching to CET? (I'd have to let the College knoe asap as the CET program seats are more limited)\n3) Any advice for a new student as a current or graduate of these programs - I'd very grateful!!",

    "postText": "I'm aware of the basic requirements (i.e., GPA above 3.6, no final grade lower than a C, etc.). But I was looking at my program summary this morning on ACSIS and noticed that it's listing a failing grade from the time I dropped out after the deadline for avoiding academic penalty, in 2009, as part of the summary for the program I just completed. The course I failed in 2009 is Communications I, and it's listed as an \"Equivalency\" for Communications I in my current summary. Even though I just redid/completed the course and passed.\n\nIt's even affecting my GPA, as for this program my term GPS were both above 3.8 but my \"cumulative GPA\" is listed as 3.64.\n\nWill this F from 13 years ago, when I was 19 and forced to drop out because of unfortunate circumstances, actually prevent me from qualifying for Dean's List?",

Though I'm certain even if I stayed in my old program, I'd qualify for DHL in the following semesters as well.\nYou're good to go",

I was just super nervous when I saw that my \"cumulative GPA\" was lower than my actual term GPA for both terms in my program, along with my failed course listed as an equivalency for the same course I just took. I'm probably overthinking it haha.",

To qualify for the Dean\u2019s Honours List, a student must meet all of the following criteria:  \n3.1 be registered in an Ontario College Credential or bachelor\u2019s degree program;   \n3.2 complete the equivalent of a full-time term course load; \n3.3   earn a grade point average (GPA) for the term between 3.60 and 4.00 with no grade    below C minus (C -);   \n3.4 have no outstanding encumbrance to the College; and.  \n3.5 have not been sanctioned for academic or non-academic conduct (refer to policies AA18 Academic Discipline and Dishonesty, AA20 Plagiarism and SA07 Student Conduct).  \n\n4. Students who have an accommodation approved by the Centre for Accessible Learning and may not be completing a full-time term load are eligible to appear on the Dean\u2019s Honours List. The students are to contact their Academic Administrator for the eligibility criteria, pre-approved by the Dean, to qualify to appear on the Dean\u2019s Honours List.    \n\n5. Should a student have an Incomplete (I) course at the end of the term, he or she will not receive recognition as a member of the Dean\u2019s Honours List until the course is completed and the final term GPA is determined to be within the qualifying range.  \n\n6. A personal letter of commendation is mailed to the students qualifying for the Dean\u2019s Honours List upon completion of the academic term. Where Dean\u2019s Honours List are publicized, students must advise the Dean should they not wish their name to be included.",

Took a look at my transcript and it showed a 2.6  GPA with a note about academic probation and \"please see your academic advisor\" which had me worried. Didn't stop me from landing on the Dean's List, qualifying for co op, and graduating with honours.\n\nDon't stress the past, you'll be fine.",

I was way too overwhelmed to withdraw properly, dealing with a roommate issue and suddenly needing to pay double the rent I had been paying up to that point meant finding a second job. I passed only one course because I skipped a bunch of exams.\n\nMy GPA was 0.5 haha. I'm honestly surprised I didn't have a note about academic probation, maybe it's because I came back for a different program, the only course the two programs had in common was Communications.",

It was there before I returned to college, probably leftover from the term where I had four Fs. I think it probably disappeared once my grades for first semester game in when I returned. I never did end up speaking to my academic advisor or anything.\n\nI don't even have a good excuse for bailing on college the first time. I was already feeling unmotivated and skipping classes, and then I started seeing someone who was going through a hard time. I invested all my time into providing emotional support and trying to solve her problems and used it as an excuse to avoid dealing with my own shit. Good times.",

I understand you would have your reason. I simply would think about the reason behind why being on that list is important enough to cause you grief in trying to get it again. \n\nAt the end of the day it's your time, effort, and mental health at risk. Good luck regardless of what you choose.",

I can tell you that seeing Dean's list on a resume will not push you to get hired. Overseas sure but not here. \n\nExperience is not easy to get at the start. You have to slowly grow it, like a plant growing, it will take time and patience. \n\nBest of luck! \n\nP.s. talk to your professors they are teaching at Algonquin not because of teaching background but content specific background. Meaning they have or had experience in the industry and will be able to give you the best advice to succeed in that industry. Never know they might be the reason you get a job in your field.",

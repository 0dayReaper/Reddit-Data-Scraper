Setting multiple reminders for various steps of assignments, ie first draft, revision, etc... Is more helpful than relying on brightspace's \"this is due tomorrow\" reminder",

This typically results in a slightly longer break between semesters.\n\nOn-campus students who were studying remotely due to the pandemic or who are taking online gen ed electives *will* have a midterm break.\n\nHope that helps!",

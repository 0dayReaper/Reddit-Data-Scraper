I\u2019m an Alberta resident so I would need to do the program online and I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else here has done this. I\u2019m not exactly a fan of online class but if you gotta do it you gotta do it. Anyone care to share their experience with this?",

Make sure that\u2019s something you are comfortable with and able to do. By self teaching I mean you will have to go out of your way to find additional resources to learn the content. I don\u2019t really find the information given to us in lectures to be enough, personally. The classes in the first semester are very easy (to me at least) except for the database one since I\u2019m not \u201cgetting it\u201d yet. The workload so far is very manageable but I\u2019ve heard it only gets worst. Overall I am really enjoying it. And it\u2019s worth noting as a dev you will always kinda have to \u201cself teach\u201d and learn new things so it\u2019s good to get used to it. I don\u2019t necessarily see that as a negative when I think about my experience in the program. \n\nSince I\u2019m new I don\u2019t have too much to share, but those are my observations so far \ud83d\ude0a",

You need to be motivated to do the work yourself. It definitely gets challenging too. But I survived! And if I can do it, you can too! Definitely take advantage of other resources and learning materials online. Meet other classmates and have people you can speak with if you\u2019re struggling. The school has tutors that you can use if you\u2019re struggling, which I recommend. The program discord is good to meet people, I made some friends there.\n\nAs far as work, I am still job hunting currently, but feel confident I will find something soon! Depending on where you\u2019re located there are some better work opportunities available. If you have any questions, reach out to ask, I don\u2019t mind at all.",

I would say that the job and company I'm with are amazing so far and I feel very lucky.\n\nI want to iterate, it did take me a year to find a job. Lots of applications, a few rounds of interviews, but I was able to find one. So stick it out! Try not to get discouraged, keep putting yourself out there, and just do the best you can! I feel so lucky to be working now, getting paid to learn, with flexible hours, all while working from home. You can do it if you keep trying! It takes an average of 9-12 months to find a job in this field.",

It is perfect for me as I work full time and I wanted a program to put a structure to my study.\n\nAs mentioned already, it is mostly a self taught program so the material is already there and you're expected to go through it so you won't have lectures with an instructor. If like me you prefer to study and review everything on your own and make your own schedule then do it.\n\nSo far I am satisfied with the program.",

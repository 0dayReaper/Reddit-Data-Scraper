I was wondering whether anyone had a decent study guide or any information on the exam because there\u2019s barely any study material available despite being a pretty hefty test. \n\nThanks!",

It seems like everyone has totally different experiences. Some people say to focus of knowing the first few elements of the periodic table. Some say formulas are provided\u2014others say they\u2019re not. Some say to focus on stoichiometry\u2014others say they mostly got balancing equations and pH questions! I would really love to pm someone who has written the exam recently. Is anyone free to chat?",

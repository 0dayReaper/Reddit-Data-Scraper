I remember people in my classes literally looking at profs with a \"wtf?!\" face at the mere mention of \"see you Monday\" \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI always figured it was because it isn't a Stat holiday. Not only that, but most college programs I know of are done by end of April for the year anyway.",

Easter Monday is a federal holiday so private businesses have the option of recognizing it as a stat or not, and only federal workers are mandated the day off (and also those who have unions that negotiated the stat).  In my union agreement there is a clause that our employer must recognize all provincial, federal, and minimal holidays, so my employer has to close for Easter Monday.  Likely Algonquin did not negotiate that clause for their employees, but other schools did.",

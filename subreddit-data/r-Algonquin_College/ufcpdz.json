    "postText": "Old computer that won\u2019t stay on without being plugged in. Other than that it works great, though. Can\u2019t afford an upgrade so looks like I\u2019ll have to rely on plugging it in in classes. I start my second semester next week and am running out of options so can anyone tell me how the classrooms are in terms of having space to charge computers?",

            "comment": "Depends on the classroom. Most have standard table desk. Long enough that you can lay your head on the table with an arm out and only having your hand dangle. So I\u2019ll say 3 feet of space by however long the table is? \n\nCharging will be the issue since not all desks have a wall plug close. I would recommend going to your classes before the semester starts and looking at them. Some are left unlocked. If not, find a similar one on that floor. They repeat the class layout and just rotate it",

I\u2019m planning on getting to campus a couple hours before my classes start on monday to get the lay of the land since I\u2019ve never been down there, so I\u2019ll make a mental note to try and check out some classrooms. Thankfully it looks like I\u2019ll be able to manage with my tablet for 2/3 days I have in person classes, so at least I only have to figure out things for mondays",

I'm not sure how crowded the campus will be next semester assuming everything is in-person.  But if you're ever spending time working on your laptop before / after class I found the quiet room in the library to be a reliable spot to charge my laptop and work in silence.  There was always at least a few seats available pre-covid, so you should always be able to find an outlet and seat there.",

Most of UOttawas classes still don\u2019t have plugs in the classroom so you have to charge before you come to campus because there\u2019s literally no where to plug into",

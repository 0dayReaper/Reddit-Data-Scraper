If you need clarifications you email the professor.  Usually they reply quite fast.\nIn some courses you can\u2019t go too fast because the assignments/quizzes become only available at certain time so no point to go too fast. Other professors just post 2-3 weeks of work so can\u2019t go too fast. Also you can\u2019t go too slow because of deadlines.",

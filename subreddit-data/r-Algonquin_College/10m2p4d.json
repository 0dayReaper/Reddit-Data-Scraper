    "postText": "Hello!\n\nSo I (24F)applied for pre-health advanced pathway, pre-health regular, and paramedic for September 2023. Obviously my main goal would be to get into paramedic, but applied for the other 2 as backups.\n\nI wrote the HPAT last week and I\u2019m expecting to hear back from the medic program in February. \n\n2 days ago I got accepted into both pre health programs and i have a couple questions. \n\n-What is the difference between the 2? I know only 1-2 classes are different but is one better than the other?\n\n- is one better specifically for a highly competitive program? (Nursing, medic etc.)\n\n- I also haven\u2019t retained that much from high school, but I have worked in the medical field, so I\u2019m not sure if pre health will be worth it before starting the medic program. \n\nAny advice is appreciated",

Advanced has the option for physics which some of the programs require. \n\nPre Health Standard is the same except one or two  classes (when I did it) just doesn\u2019t give you admission to those programs, and no physics.",

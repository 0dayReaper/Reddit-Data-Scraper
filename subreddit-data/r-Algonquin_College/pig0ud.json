    "postText": "Hey everyone!! \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think how fast the summer went!! ... and how we\u2019re already a couple days in September already! It\u2019s wild how the school year starts in 2 days... (for those in-school programs) and a week after for Online... \n\nIt\u2019ll go by faster than you know it, so try and enjoy it while it lasts!! \n\n\u2014 Read it all, or read whatever you want to! I hope this eases your nerves! \n\n#For those newcomers\n\nYou\u2019ll kill it, and I know you\u2019ll do well. My best advice would be to start on your assignments the moment they come up... you\u2019ll feel a lot better knowing its done early, and you\u2019ll be less stressed.. giving you that extra time to look over things before that due date. \n\nAlso, **ask advice when you do not know!!** - whether that be to your classmates, or professor.. everyone wants to do well, and you\u2019re all a team. \nMaybe someone else in your class doesn\u2019t know how to do (x) either... and needs help with it... or maybe **ALL** of your class needs a refresher on how to do (x) ... you can be a \u201clifesaver\u201d .. but it does not hurt by asking for help when you need it ..\n\nHelp each other out when you can! \n\nSidenote -This is the obvious thing, but \n\n- Meet a lot of people, and try new things! \n\n*The school year is a lot more fun, and less boring with new people - to talk to, or hangout with!*\n\n**If you\u2019re in Residence** , show up to those \u201cactivities\u201d at the res, or just talk to literally whoever that walks by you / in the elevator , whatever.. you might find some amazing people by doing so. I\u2019d love to go back to my years in residence , they were a ton of fun! And I wish the same for you. \n\n**If you\u2019re debating dropping the program?** \n\nWeigh the pros and the cons. Is it something that can be fixed? Is it just a certain course you don\u2019t like? or is it more than that? \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend talking to a Student Counselor who can put you on the right track, and maybe find some similar programs like the one you chose. \u2014 or one that benefits your wants/needs/interests more. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with changing programs, and its **NOT** \u201cwasting money\u201d as you tried something you thought you\u2019d like... but didnt.. trial, and error, and you still walk away with knowledge in that area. Still a ton of memories, and -maybe- friends you\u2019ve met in the program, and others. \u2014- Maybe later on it will interest you and be able to catch back at it, at a later date. \n\n\u2014- I don\u2019t mean to scare newcomers - but if you aren\u2019t doing so \u201chot\u201d , not getting those grades you want? **Tell your professor** ... they want to help you succeed, like mentioned above... and below (if you decide to read further!) \n\nSee if there are things you can do to recover those marks, and grades. If not? They may push back your program a semester/year to makeup for the lost course... - and thats for you to decide if wish to cope with it, and push through... or go another route. \n\n**Not meaning to scare newcomers, as I hope you picked something you enjoy, and can see yourself doing for the long route..**\n\n- but you can always return later on for another program, whether you pass, or f... ...Nothing wrong with learning more knowledge !! It will help you further down the road. - and I can promise you that. \n\n#Returning students\n\nYou\u2019ve been killin\u2019 it already. Keep going! All your hard work will be paid off!! \n\nHelp out those newcomers if you wish by talking, or helping study - but you\u2019ll feel good knowing you\u2019re doing a good thing for someone who might be super stressed out, not know anything, etc., \n\n- Because remember, those newcomers might be feeling how you felt. \n\nYou\u2019ll get that paper before you know it! and it\u2019ll be worth every second! \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n#Overall\n\nThe school years go by super fast.. as does time. How are we 4 months near a New Year? I have 0 idea... my brain is still trying to comprehend 2020, lol! \n\nEnjoy it. Make memories. Meet new people - virtually or in person ... and just get out of that comfort zone if you can. \n\nAll the best in the new school year. You\u2019ll do well - take deep breaths... relax... and all will be okay! \n\nWe all want to do well, and we will! - together! \n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nHave a great rest of your long weekend! \n\nTake care\n\nStay safe!\n\nGood luck!",

I didn\u2019t do so well in school when I was young and that experience haunts me. Let\u2019s see how it goes this time!",

Can\u2019t change that stuff! Look forwards at the new perspective, and what you want the future to look like... just have a planned \u201cgoal\u201d ... but take life day by day - you\u2019ll feel at ease! \n\nI hope it goes well for you, and you do better than you ever expected!\n\nBest of luck!",

Cliques, nothing to do, very little activities on campus, no where to study. So freaking busy because it was so small. Mental health care at the campus was low, high wait times. \n\nOttawa is busy, but there is always something to do. An event, an activity. Lots of services for help with much more open spaces. The cliques were mostly within programs not in general which was nice. Lots of friends to meet. Campus is gorgeous, library is amazing, student centre is great place to study. Lots of food options. I lived in residence at Ottawa campus and it was great, although loud and always smelling like weed, it\u2019s nice to have your own room and bathroom and never need to worry about food or rent since you pay it only 2 time a year. \n\nPlus the PN program at Ottawa is 100+ students compared to 20-50 at smaller campuses. Ottawa has more clinical placement opportunities from what I remember too!",

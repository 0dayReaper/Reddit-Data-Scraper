Timmies is closed rn, and there's a sign saying the court itself is closed too :o (I guess it will open back up at the start of the term).\n\nAlso went over to look at the old Ron Port Athletic Facility. There is a perfectly good mini-gym on the South side of A-building... just locked up!\n\nThe Thunder Dome is now called Algonquin College Student Association Sports Field.. doesn't exactly roll off the tongue...\n\nI am starting this fall, the history of this campus is just fascinating to me.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm in Business Accounting in my second last semester, and I have been applying for government jobs through FSWEP since the second year of starting my program, but none of the employers picked up my application.  \n\nCan anyone tell me how to get a job in the government without experience in the field? Is anyone working with the gov and had to go through that?\n\nNote: I don't speak French",

            "comment": "Learn French....that is key. Your chances of getting a position are severely reduced for English only positions. Then if you do happen to get a job you will be hampered for career progression.\n\nFSWEP has over 10000 students in the inventory, so it is not easy getting a student position.\n\nCoop is the better way to get a govt.   Student position, but not an option in your case since you are at the end of your studies.\n\nContinue to apply on gcjobs for all job postings you meet the criteria for....it takes a long time.\n\nIf you want to work in the FI stream ( finance, accounting) you will need a Degree to move up higher than FI01",

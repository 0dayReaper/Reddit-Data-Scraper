    "postText": "I've seen people ask questions about how long it takes for competitive programs to get back about offers, and most say around feb 18. But for the animation program, the portfolio submission deadline is feb 22nd and they say it'll be ranked by march 1dt. It still says my application is in process on ACSIS, no wait list or offer.\nSo where do you find rankings?\nAny other Animation applicants that got their results back yet?",

Those were the answers: (note that the deadline for them was late March, not late February like us).\n\n\"hey! I'm not sure exactly, but we knew a couple of weeks after the portfolio submission deadline. Good luck!\"\n\n\"I sent mine jan 21st and got acceptance feb 1st, if that also helps?? Tho i think that might have been around the earlest they get back to peeps\u2026 so that might skew things\"\n\n\"I had to wait 3 months\"- this person probably got waitlisted, and accepted after a while, or sent their portfolio very early on\n\n\"Yeah, I believe we got results the last few weeks of April\"\n\nSo, a couple of weeks after the portfolio deadline. I sent mine in February 4th, and got accepted in February 8th, but it was faster than most students, from what you can gather in those replies.",

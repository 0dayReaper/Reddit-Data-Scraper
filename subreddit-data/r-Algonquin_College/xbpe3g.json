    "postText": "Welcome to a new school year, one thing I like more than the smell of new textbooks is saving money. \n\nFor anyone new, FYI Loblaws usually offers 10% back in points on Tuesdays  , but if for whatever you are in the east end on McCarther ave... That can be in cash! \n\nBonus: while out there check out Green Fresh supermarket across the street for even more interesting ethnic options and 5% off for being a student!!!\n\nHere is an article worth reading with more discounts around the city. \nhttps://www.narcity.com/ottawa/23-student-discounts-must-take-advantage-ottawa\n\nOther Reddit communities worth checking out IMO\n\nr/shopcanada\nr/greatcanadianreferral",

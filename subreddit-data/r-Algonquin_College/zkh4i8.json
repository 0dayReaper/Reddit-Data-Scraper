            "comment": "Depending on their selecting criteria. If they select us based on when we apply for the program (chronologically), then your chance is high, because they just changed the availability of spring 2023 for international students from open to waitlisted around Nov 30.\n\nI got a seat for fall 2023 as well and then applied for the spring 2023 intake. I saw the availability was open when I made my request on Nov 25, but it changed to waitlisted when I checked it a few days later and I got put on the waitlist just like you. They said the waitlist for spring has yet to be officially generated and suggested me to check back in in a few weeks.",

So i got really lucky.\n\nAnd then i asked if about spring term and got on the wait list.\n\nMy advice is that you yet all ur documents ready, and the school can either give u a seat in next semester or u get a refund .",

Faculty can't ask for more money, even if they wanted to.\n\nKnow this, too: a strike will ultimately end with something called binding interest arbitration, where a mediator takes proposals from both sides to create the final new collective agreement.  The faculty union is trying to avoid this strike by agreeing to this arbitration already (months ago, actually).  It's the college presidents that are refusing to do it and are thus wasting everyone's time by prolonging the inevitable.\n\nEmail Claude Brule and tell him to smarten up.",

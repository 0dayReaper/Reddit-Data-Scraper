    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m in Business admi(core) major in HR. I\u2019m facing real difficulties with group assignments and lots of writing which I didn\u2019t expect would be that much. \nI\u2019m so stressed and anxious since this semester started because I can\u2019t handle the pressure of group assignments as sometimes I do most of the work! \n\nI\u2019m thinking of switching to something doesn\u2019t require writing like Accounting or Finance maybe. But I have not idea what the process of  the switching. \n\nDo the HR courses I\u2019m taking will be counted in any of accounting or finance majors?  \n\nPlease if someone went through that or know someone was in my case Dm or comment below.",

I know the stress all you can do is complain to the profs and director of the program",

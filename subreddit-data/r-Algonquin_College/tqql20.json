Just look at the list of GED courses for your program and pick an old course that relates to it. It takes a few weeks to process, but you'll get an exemption applied to your transcript automatically.",

Should I try anyways? Are they lenient? For example, one course Algonquin lists is Positive Psychology... do you think that I can submit Abnormal Psychology as an exemption?",

Just wondering your thoughts, I really liked the school, and if you recommend these programs.  \n\nIf you are in it, is there any takeaways you can give me? or how the classes are?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I\u2019m taking the business administration core with a major in general business my goal is to go to Carlton university to get a bachelors of commerce with a focus on information systems or accounting. I love my program I feel like I\u2019m learning and the stuff you learn seems to be as current as it can be. Certain things though I wish would be a stand alone option is learning SAP there is an option but it\u2019s for ppl who major in supply.",

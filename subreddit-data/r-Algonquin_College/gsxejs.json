No theory courses will be offered in-person.\n\nIf things continue to improve in Ottawa, the plan is to have in-person labs offered on campus. These labs would be much smaller than usual, in order to respect physical distancing guidelines, and students and staff will be trained in using PPE as necessary.\n\nIt will not be \"back to normal\" at Algonquin in fall, but this is far better than it could have been.\n\nAdditional information here:  [https://www.algonquincollege.com/coronavirus/faq-students-new/](https://www.algonquincollege.com/coronavirus/faq-students-new/)",

If you are still enrolled, you should still have access to the starter kit you receive in Pre-an, I just imagine you have to order it? I\u2019m not sure. I imagine an information session is in order. Rich is a super nice guy and hard worker, I\u2019m sure there will be more information soon.",

It could defintley happen :) keep your hopes up! Just call in April and see where you are on the waitlist!",

It\u2019s an 18 month program so it will finish in half the time, but the program is twice the work. I wouldn\u2019t count on being admitted from a wait list. Dental hygiene is ridiculously competitive, and I wouldn\u2019t  rely on being admitted from the wait list, that\u2019s like betting your career on hope. Apply to other programs in your area, and if later Algonquin sends you an invitation, can can accept it or not. But if it\u2019s really what you want to do, you should shop around different schools until you secure a spot at at least 1 institution.",

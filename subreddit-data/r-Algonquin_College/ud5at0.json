    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI am interested in attending Algonquin, their fall (September) programs specifically. Is it too late for me to apply right now? If so, can I apply for the Winter (January) programs? I'm asking this because their programs are still available for application, but say \"waitlisted\"? How can I be waitlisted if I didn't even apply yet?",

They get many more applicants than there are spots, so there is immediately a wait list and for some programs that wait list is very long.\n\nFor you that means if you applied now it would be extremely unlikely for you to move off the wait list for Fall, in all honesty I would wait to apply for the 23-24 application cycle next year.  \\*Edit\\*  If there is a different equal consideration date for Winter and it has not passed yet then you could still apply.",

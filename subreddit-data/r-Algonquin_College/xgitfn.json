Does anyone the difference? \n\nIf anyone can help me figure out what best learning tool for this class would be much appreciated.",

            "comment": "Taxation Textbook will have slight changes with each addition so you might not need the newest addition but confirm with your professor. Making an ass out of myself I'm assuming each year there is a new addition , for two years. That means any taxation laws that were added 3-6 years ago will not appear in the textbook making it incorrect. So...ask your professor.\n\nTaxation is math and memorization which usually means the best way to study is through practicing multiple questions over and over. You will eventually find your own way to make things make sense. You can also look for a tutor here: https://algonquincollege.libguides.com/slc/peer-tutoring \n\nTutoring is beneficial because that person will provide you with the same information but in a different way that might click for you. If you don't want a tutor you can look for online videos from YouTube, LinkedIn Learning, etc. \n\nGood luck,\nHope this helps!!",

    "postText": "Hi everybody,\n\nI am starting RPN in the fall and would like to ask some questions beforehand. Do any previous RPN students have any advice on the workload? how heavy is it? do you find it relatively hard? \n\nhow many hours a week can you work while going to school? \n\nwhat did your schedule for classes look like? late night classes or mostly mornings? \n\nalso, how big are the classes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you guys for your help!",

            "comment": "Graduated in June 2022!\n\nWorkload is tough. There\u2019s a lot of assignments, classes and group projects. There\u2019s a lot of studying, chapters and stuff to do. My advice is skim read, utilize our Google classroom for new RPN students (if you don\u2019t have the link dm me!) skim read your text books don\u2019t read the full thing. \n\nLevel 1/2/3 are the heavy ones. Level 4 and consolidation are hard too but you\u2019ve adjusted by then. \n\nI personally couldn\u2019t work, the schedule was too heavy. You could probably make it work. It depends on the person!\n\nAll semesters I had classes from 8am to 8pm usually. Big breaks between or no breaks at all. Mondays is usually lab, Wednesday / Tuesdays is usually clinical (full days or full evenings. 7-8 hours.) \n\nDepends on the campus. Ottawa campus, the large lectures were the full class size (100-120 people sometimes) smaller classes were 20-30. Lab classes were typically 10-15. Clinical is 4-8 people. \n\nFeel free to dm me with any other questions!",

    "postText": "Good afternoon, everyone. I got accepted to game development, and I'm just wondering what software we will be using unity or unreal engine in the course. Also if anyone has taken the course what will I need to get my self ready do I need my own laptop if so what are the specs I need or should I use parsec to connect my PC to a regular laptop. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nThank you, and have a great weekend.",

They have 100s of computers with hardware from 2014, and I'm not sure if they're going to teach the stuff that 2019 hardware has, but the point is they probably still have hardware for you to use.\n\nthey use unity for the most part, but unreal will pop up a couple times. If you're self-taught at gamedev and programming, perhaps all you really need is a shaders/computer graphics course. That was all I needed from the program, personally.\n\nNever decline an opportunity to play quake, you will regret it.\n\nIf you've never made games before, nothing is stopping you from getting game maker or unity and following a tutorial. That will help, and it will show you a taste of how much math and art is involved. Generally, if you understand the amount of math and art you'll be doing, you'll do fine.\n\nI also recommend you learn the signs and symptoms of sociopaths because one of them will be teaching you. Everyone else on the staff is awesome and knowledgeable though",

    "postText": "I've been researching the computer programming program and I was wondering if any current attendants/ graduates could answer some questions\n\n1. Would you personally recommend to join during the fall semester or the winter semester? I ask because the fall semester is currently waitlisted and I doubt it will open up by the time school starts.\n2. What was your experience in trying to find coops/ employment after you graduated? Is having the 2 year diploma enough to find a job? I ask because wouldn't employers favor people who did the three-year program or have a university degree in CS ( or something related)\n3. How hard did you find the program? By this I mean is it something that would be out be out of this world for someone with very little/ no programming experience or would it be manageable as long as you put your head to the grindstone.\n4. What recommendations do you have for someone who was considering the program?\n\nThank you for reading my questions, and I hope some people will be able to answer.",

            "comment": "1. I joined during the winter semester and found that my peers were a lot older than me and were very serious about their schooling. This may have been because there weren\u2019t many students coming fresh out of high school.\n\n2. Found a co-op in government after my 3rd semester. In my opinion, the two-year program doesn\u2019t prepare you for acquiring a job in the private sector, so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for prepare to learn about data structures on your own time.\n\n3. I had a lot of experience so I found most of it achievable, however the program caught up to my prior ability partly through the second semester. Definitely doable if you put the time in and treat it like a job.\n\n4. Study everything yourself. Don\u2019t wait for teachers to teach things properly, because they never will, and you\u2019ll notice that your peers spend a lot of their time complaining. Work hard, this program is only 2 years long and if you\u2019re looking for a job soon after you can get in and out quickly without the crushed soul and brain fog that comes from spending 4 years at a university. The industry is all about your ability to learn new things, and this program is your chance to pick up that skill.",

And yes, I took the COBOL course but my department doesn\u2019t use COBOL at all as far as I\u2019m aware so it probably would\u2019ve been more helpful if I took the Business Intelligence course instead. That may vary depending on department and role.\n\nEdit: More info, the co-op job search goes by in rounds so I had to revise my resume since I didn\u2019t get anything the first round. Keep our resume very concise and straight-cut so it actually gets through HR. The interview is your opportunity to show your personality.",

I also made a little project that took like 10 minutes and put it on github, then mentioned my resume and linked my github in my resume. They brought it up in my interview so I think it was a good call, it turned out to be a nice talking point about my interests outside of school even if it was embellished a bit",

Although I can\u2019t speak for what it\u2019s like after graduating/finding a job etc. \n\nI can tell you what my experience so far with the program. I came into the program with little to no experience with Computer Programming. I have a background in healthcare and when COVID started, I decided it was time for a change. I applied when the program was waitlisted, and unfortunately I didn\u2019t secure a spot. So I re-applied again for Fall 2021 and successfully got in. \n\nThe program is challenging. Specially if you have no prior experience to CP, but it\u2019s definitely doable if you put in the work. \n\nI find that second term was easier than the first, since I had some knowledge of the materials being taught. With my first term, I struggled with most of my classes since everything was new to me! I think the class I struggled the most was Math! \n\nI recommend signing up for free programming classes online. I find that codecademy helped a lot. And I watched tons of youtube videos about programming concepts.",

I started in the summer term and honestly it doesn\u2019t really matter when you start, you\u2019ll typically have fuller classes with high schoolers in fall but after midterms people slowly stop showing up to class. \n\n2. Depending on your networking skills and other projects you\u2019ve done. To really stand out to recruiters I highly suggest doing you\u2019re own side projects so that your resume stands out. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019ve been in school for 2 or 3 years it\u2019s the experiences you gained and that\u2019s why going into the coop stream is so important. I only got into the private sector because a friends dad took a big risk with hiring me for my first coop but when it came time to apply for my second and third coop terms I had people requesting me. \n\n3. I started off CET not knowing how to code but after a month you\u2019ll understand a lot more. I did have a bunch of breakdowns but I feel like any stem course will do that to y\u2019a. Also GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND!!!\n\n4. Don\u2019t plagiarize, keep networking and when it comes time to look for a job/coop it\u2019s really important to know what you\u2019re doing but you also need to have a good personality\n\nFeel free to pm me if you have any more questions",

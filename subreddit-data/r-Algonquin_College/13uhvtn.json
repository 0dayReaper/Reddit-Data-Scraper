    "postText": "Hi! From what I\u2019ve gathered, practical nursing students are divided into different groups that have different placements, schedules and lab times. One of my friends is also going into the PN program and we want to carpool. I was wondering if it\u2019s possible to contact AC and ask if we can be placed in the same group? \nIf this is possible, does anyone know who to contact? \nTIA!",

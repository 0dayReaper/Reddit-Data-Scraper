    "postText": "I am going to have my PR this year and my plan is go to Algonquin college for my re-education.\n\nI found that there are lots of program about computer science and software engineering, I am interested in all of them:\n\n* Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science (CET-CS, Advanced Technology, 3 years)\n* Computer Programming and Analysis (CPA, Advanced Technology, 3 years)\n* Computer Programming (CP, Advanced Technology, 2 years)\n* Web Development and Internet Applications (WebDev, Advanced Technology, 2 years)\n* Mobile Application Design and Development (MADD, Arts and Design, 2 years)\n\nAnd lots of question about how to make the choice, that is also my question.\n\nAs a senior IT operation engineer with more than 10 years experience outside Canada, I have no software program experience before, and I want to have some software skill, after my study and research, I want to apply the CET-CS program as my new career start.\n\nHere is my reason:\n\nBase on the course setting, I think CET-CS has more value that can make me go deep and further in this industry. CET-CS has some unique course: Calculus, Data Structures, Processor Architecture, C/C++/Java language, Compilers ... \n\nSome people will say that some courses in this program is too old. Yes, it is well known that the knowledge iteration of this industry is very fast. I would say it is only the superficial phenomena. The unique contents of CET-CS are timeless, classic, at least not outdated yet. If I really want to have a lifetime career, that 's it.\n\nCET-CS is not perfect, as I know, to cover modern industry needs, something like DevOps, Cloud topics should be covered, then maybe AI, blockchain ... there are always too much things to learn.\n\nBUT, there is no absolutely correct choice for everybody.\n\nIf you just want to find a way into the industry, if you are not sure yet that you are ready. If you don't want to quit by those hard, difficult to understand contents. If you want to follow interests first, like interesting learning process. If you have not enough time or enough money, Then chose those 2 years program. We always have chance to study, at everyone's own pace.\n\nI heard that CP will the most likely let you get an offer from GOV.\n\nAnd I notice that MADD courses are new and interesting, and they also have a super coordinator Professor Steve to try to explain everything here for every potential student. I wish I could have chance to finish CET-CS and MADD the same time.\n\nI have no idea about CPA, it seems like it's a new program start from 2023.\n\nI am not sure I am making a good choice, just want to share with you here.",

I will try to make it simple.\n\nI can hardly find a job in my country and Canada, because I was a Linux/Unix system admin and Oracle database admin. It was a quite popular job before Cloud Computing, maybe 10 - 20 years ago, If you are familiar one or two product, like HPUX, IBM AIX, Oracle database, you can find a salary good job. But no more today, Maybe those jobs still can be found on the market, just several, but there is no future. It is an example of the rapid change in the IT industry. \n\nBefore, we can manually finish system admin tasks, but now a days, almost all the position need to do the coding, programming. \n\nI was tired of all about this. In the past several years, I once wanted to leave the tech position, had some chance, but non of those good enough.\n\nNow, I want to come back again, It's still a good industry. I used to do well, should be able to continue doing well, but not 100% sure.\n\nWe'll see.",

From my impression, Linux Syadmin and DBA are one of the high demanded positions in Canada, I guess it is not the case anymore? Maybe not in Ontario from your experience here?  And yes I do agree more and more positions requires scripting, automation and shifts to more DevOps side. In fact I'm studying CST program in Algonquin as an international student, your post makes me wondering what the future perspectives for me will be here.",

The more the job simpler and easier, the higher risk that it could be layoff or be abandoned by the industrial revolution.\n\nWe used to build a software platform on several commercial hardware systems to solve business needs, and such solutions were very expensive. And those IT service jobs are simple.\n\nAfter Cloud era, the commercial value is transferred from the expensive and closed ecosystem to those open and cheaper solutions, and the commercial value began to shift from hardware to software. The original relatively single system management technology was replaced by open technology and more complex software definition. If the original system administrator wants to continue to develop in this industry, he needs to keep up with the pace, IaaS, DevOps, Container, software-defined storage, software-defined network, and AI.\n\nCST maybe a little diff with my industry, what I am talking here is Enterprise IT service. As I know, if you are going to do the Windows desktop support, it won't be so challenge as I had before. \n\nHope it helps.",

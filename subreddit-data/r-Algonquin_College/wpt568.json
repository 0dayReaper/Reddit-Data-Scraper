What do I need to do to survive?\n\nAnd what do you recommend courses before starting the program?\n\nHow to join the community of students or alums groups?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for answering, and have a perfect day.",

If you have free time before the semester, you can optionally:\n\n1. Watch some java tutorials\n\n2. Play around with java\n\nWhen school starts, you would have already wrapped your head around the basics and general structure of coding and concepts may be easier to understand in lectures.\n\nIf you **don't** understand something in class, jot down the topic and just watch a quick YouTube video after class and it would likely help bring everything together.",

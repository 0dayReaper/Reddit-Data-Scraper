Some of the classmates I saw get jobs in field also had a university degree in computer science.\n\nThe program itself is pretty difficult. If you can already code decently, it'll be easier. But semester 3 in particular requires a ridiculous amount of work. You cannot coast through it. I found college engineering easier, honestly. If you know nothing about coding, they will teach you the very basics. And then throw you to the wolves.\n\nYou will deal with a lot of bullshit. The facilitators aren't professors, they are just there to answer emails and occasionally grade assignments. You are only a name/number on a screen. It's very easy for them to phone it in. The facilitator in our networking class didn't grade any assignments until after the course had ended. No one knew how well they were doing in the course going into the final exam. I don't think she answered any emails. We found out she had done this in past semesters as well. There were many times stuff like this happened, and your only recourse is a student survey. \n You will deal with bullshit in the assignments. Broken rubrics, tasks, questions, tests, etc. I received a zero once because the rubric was missing the requirement the facilitator was grading. He said tough luck. Sometimes there is nothing you can do but take the L. I could go on like this for a long time.\n\nMost of the facilitators were wonderful though. I'm not the kind of person to blame the teacher when they don't get the result they want. But even with that mindset, I still came away pretty bitter.",

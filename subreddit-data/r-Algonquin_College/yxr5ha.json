    "postText": "Hey guys, I just received an offer of Interactive Media Design (IMD). I do have a few questions and not sure if you can answer?\n\n1. even though I chose a co-op version, it is not guarantee to be provided a co-op opportunity. Just waana know is it very difficult to locate a co-op during the class? What elements are critical for me to achieve a co-op?\n\n2. Touchwood if I am not able to get a co-op eventually, will it affect my graduation? Is it possible for me to shift to the non-coop version if that is the case?\n\nThanks in advance and I am looking forward to your reply.",

I suggest you make a portfolio and a professional LinkedIn and attach it to your resume. You\u2019ll have a \u201cget ready coop\u201d class to help with writing cover letters and resumes what to do and not to do. As a good cover letter is great \n\n2. If you don\u2019t get one you will graduate a semester early they will switch you over if you ask your coordinators to do that as well as before the deadline date for the semester.",

I saw on another post that some people struggle with the programming courses / stats and it can bring your overall GPA down which I know is needed to be eligible for co-op when the time comes.",

Depending if you good in Website Development aka coding and design. The program is more coding based then design FYI. I went into this program with no knowledge of coding, but I got a hang of it. I don\u2019t suggest you go to the program if you don\u2019t know anything about coding though.",

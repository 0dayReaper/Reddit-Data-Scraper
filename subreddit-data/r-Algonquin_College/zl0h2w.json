Has anyone got accepted in to hygiene after being waitlisted? I was wondering if anyone has gone through the pre-health program and what was your average that got you accepted into the DH program. Also is there any advantage with applying to the DH at algonquin after prehealth and do international students take any placement test? What has been your experience with the prehealth program?",

Its getting competitive every year, so luckily I was able to enroll in the Winter 2023 without HPAT for dental assisting. According to me its better to get both certifications due to increasing competition.",

Some courses look unavailable because they are changing them. After I enrolled in Office Admin Executive last August, the program changed. It now has courses listed that are different from when I began, and don't seem to be available yet, but I can still carry on with the older version of the program, but have to look the courses up individually to register from the main online course list.  \n \n\nHere's the link for your missing one: https://www.algonquincollege.com/online/courses/document-production-ii/  \n\n\nHope that makes sense.",

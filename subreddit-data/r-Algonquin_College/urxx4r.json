            "comment": "Hey! I lived there three years ago and it was good. \n\nI was on the second in a corner unit so that may effect part of my comments but!\n\n1. Soundproof, to your neighbours yes, concrete wall between rooms. To your roommate no. The vents sound tends to follow if they\u2019re blaring music but overall it was good. \n\n2. The size of the rooms vary but are all large. My room was fairly large, and if you want pictures I can send you some! Each room comes with a double bed, very long desk, three drawer dresser and a closet build into the wall. With all of that I still had room to dance around and spread out. Each room has a huge window too so lots of natural light. \n\n3. I was brand new to Ottawa and had never lived in a big city alone before so residence was a great thing for me. With it being so close to campus I was able to go back to my room between classes with my friends, pre covid of course. The location was convient since there\u2019s so many food, work and outing options around the school. The meal card was great, you could use it anywhere on campus. I used it at Starbucks a lot and the food is really good. My parents liked the meal card so they didn\u2019t need to worry I wasn\u2019t eating or starving because I had no money. I still bought a few groceries occasionally, maybe like $25-50 a week on stuff that they didn\u2019t have on campus. The bus system is right there and you can go anywhere so that was also a plus. \n\nMy only downsides were that it was occasionally loud during halloween or random parties or assholes would pull the fire alarm at 3am (on a Friday or Sat night always too, and I\u2019d be drunk with no pants on passed out in bed.) Roommate fights do suck but everyone has them. Mine and I fought on and off all year but 3 years later and we still talk and are friends!\n\nIn general I loved Res. No worries about paying bills, food is always available, lots of resources and security. It was a great experience and i loved it! The price is worth it!",

            "comment": "live there 3 years ago and was sent home from covid, \n\nres is extremely expensive and not worth it, if you get a place in res you have to buy a mandatory meal plan on top of res fees (I think the minimum plan is an additional $1400 its so unnecessarily expensive for 8 months and really overrated) \n\nbeing sent home bc of covid was an absolute shit show, as soon as they canceled classes I left but had to come back and move all my stuff out, they made everyone move out of ONE DOOR, imagine over 100+ people trying to move their shit out of one fire escape door. This one RA his name was bryce was so inept and daft majority of other RA's are as-well, not to mention RA's sleeping with 1st years.... \n\nbut before covid hit i really didn't enjoy it, guest visiting was so strict you had to sign in your guest before 12 am (which is fair) you had to flash your ID card when walking in after 12am (they set up a little desk) to be fair I can understand the safety precautions but it was stupid. Not just RA's were creepy but front desk staff asking for your number. I never felt unsafe though just thought the res was run like a circus.  \n\nI knew ppl who lived in res for 2021 (peak covid) and it was 80 X worse, absolutely no guests, you could only stay in your room (no dorm parties), overall very controlling like a prison, limited hours to get food. \n\nI don't know what its like now but I never did any dorm parties, its not like uni thats all I have to say.",

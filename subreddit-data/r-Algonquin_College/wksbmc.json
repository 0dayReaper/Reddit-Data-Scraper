There\u2019s a lot of events, games,music, tours I believe etc etc. You are free to go home after ur Orientation tho (but also I went to my first AC day 1 in 2018 so things could\u2019ve completely changed haha)",

After that it's just a series of social and learning-based events that you can pick and choose depending on what seems appealing!\n\nIf you want you can also use that time to find some of your classrooms so you're not lost on campus when you have in-person classes.",

If you end up finding a special someone who lives in res, get signed in, don\u2019t drink in the halls, and try not to cause any disruptions. Be respectful to those around you and if someone is being disruptive, aggressive, or generally rude, you can report them to any staff you meet. \n\nSecurity is going to have their hands full all day so please limit complaints to those of a serious nature. (I.e. physical altercation, drunk and disorderly, etc.)\n\nWe just want you to feel welcomed and for you to have a good time! Don\u2019t be afraid to ask any staff questions if you have them!",

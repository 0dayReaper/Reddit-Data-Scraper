    "postText": "Hey there! \n\nI applied to Algonquin to take a post-graduate certificate in project management. I am hoping to work towards a certification in project management and I was wondering if anyone has taken this program before? What are your thoughts on it? Is it worth it? \n\nAlso: is a co-op beneficial to do in a one year program? How is the co-op office at Algonquin?\n\nThank you in advance!",

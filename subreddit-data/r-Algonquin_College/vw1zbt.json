    "postText": "I've applied to the Computer Systems Networking and was wondering \n\n1. Is there anything I can do to ensure that I do well in the program?\n2. How hard is it to find employment, like does the government hire people from this program like they do from Computer Programming\n3. Are there any courses you recommend online so that you do well in this course?\n4. What technology do you recommend to do well in this course?\n5. How hard was it to find a CO-OP placement?\n\nThank  you for  reading, and have a good day.",

            "comment": "Hey There, I am a Graduate of the program, let me see if I can answer some of your questions, \n\nWell to answer first question, study often, form a group of friends to ask questions to.  GOOGLE is your friend, use it. Finally use the resources offer to you by your peers, like for instance. If you like, I can offer you the discord link to the Official discord Program Server, which is full of past, present and future student, like yourself. It is also filled with links to PDF, website and some of the program profs have joined too. It a great resource to have. If want an invite just send me a private message. I will happily share it. \n\nWith regards to finding employment after the program, well it depends, most of the time, graduates will end up being hired by their past co-op placement. Or some will just apply to a government job and get hire, other will apply to the private sector. \n\nWith regards to your third question, I\u2019m assuming you are referring to classes you could take before the program, well I would look into Linux and basic Linux commands. Maybe dip your toes into some YouTube video on Subnetting would probably help too. However if you join the discord, there are a ton of notes that you can read ahead of time. If you wish. \n\nTo answer your forth question, if you want to do well and not cause yourself pain. Do not attempt this program with a MacBook. This program is based around Windows OS and the labs are made to be done on them. So having a windows laptop, with preferably 16gb of Ram, 256gb or 500gb storage and at least a 4 or 6 core cpu. Will allow you to succeed. Plus whatever the other specs they tell you, internet jack, USB ports, etc\u2026\n\nFinally to answer your last question, with regards to co-op. It depends, for some it very easy and for other like me it was a bit of a challenge. I had a hard time because i was applying to jobs that many other applied for too and I was just unlucky.  Eventually I got one though. \n\nHowever I will say this now, when you do reach this part and start applying to placement yourself, don\u2019t just apply to the government and ignore what other call the \u201cbottom feeder jobs\u201d(The lvl 1 Helpdesk or call Center job). Many forgot that no matter how beneath you think this job is. It still a job that pays. In our job field, there no such thing as a shit job. In order to make it anywhere you need to get your foot in the door. Many forgot that and think you will land an extremely high paying job right out the gate after graduation. It very rare for that to happen. \n\nHopefully this answered your questions, Anyways as a reminder, just send me a message if you want the link to the discord, or if you have further questions. I will try to answer them as best as I can.",

All of my friends have gotten good employment after following the program. Do coop if you can, it has immense value in terms of getting your foot in the door for a gov job, at the very least. Co-op placements were super easy to find. Employers love Algonquin students as the practical work they do is oftentimes more suited for the workplace than say, a university thory-heavy class.",

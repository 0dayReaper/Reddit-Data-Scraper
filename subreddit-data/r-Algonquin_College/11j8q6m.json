I read that it will be done through Accuplacer and I saw all of the requirements, but what is the setup like? Will I have someone watching me through Zoom the entire time? Will I need to screen share? How long will I have to take the test?",

The Examity proctor requested to see 360 view in the beginning and after that they just need to make sure you don\u2019t leave your seat or anything like that. The exam is through accuplacer as well. I just did mine about a month ago and it consisted of 20 English (reading passages and comprehension), 20 arithmetic questions and 50 science questions split into 25 bio, 25 Chem and 10 physics. Hope that helps. Good luck !",

Also, do they allow scrap pieces of paper and a calculator? I\u2019d also like to know what resources you used and how long you studied before you took the test :)",

                            "comment": "The math ones were pretty straightforward - lots of fractions and percents etc. The English comprehension stuff can be tricky at times but just make sure you read and re-read the questions and pick the question that fits best - not just one that is \u2018technically\u2019 correct. The science portion is definitely a lot harder to study for and if you know you cell biology (mitosis/meiosis and organelles and their functions), basic systems (circulatory etc.) and punnet squares that should get your through the vast majority of bio. Chem is some valence bond theory, redox reactions (with charges) and being able to identify different types of reactions. I heard also that there was some organic Chem but I didn\u2019t see any on my test. For physics make sure you know newtons laws and electromagnetism and you\u2019ll be relatively fine. I don\u2019t know your background so I can\u2019t say how much time you might need to study since I spent 4 years in uni studying Biochem is was definitely easier than it would be for others. They also only allow a calculator on specific questions (and they are few and far between) and blank pieces of paper are allowed - bring like 5, you won\u2019t need more than that.\n\nThat\u2019s about all I can remember",

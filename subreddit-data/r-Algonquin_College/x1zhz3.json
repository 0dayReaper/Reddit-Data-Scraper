If everything checks out then I would recommend contacting IT Support at 5555@algonquincollege.com\n\nIn short your email is set up the moment you are registered in classes.",

From my end here, it says the following: \n\n\"AC Online courses are not scheduled in your ACSIS timetable.  \nCourses become available through the Learning Management System (LMS) on the start date, and you will work at your own pace to meet the assessment requirements and deadlines within the LMS.\"",

I assumed this at the start but in ACSIS go under \"Network Account Info\" and look their for it. \n\nUnfortunately, AC Online does things differently so if you can't find it I would recommend contacting IT support to avoid lots of inquiries because they would be able to give you the best and most accurate answer regardless online or not.",

I'm not from Ottawa and this is my first time moving, pretty far too. So if anyone knows anything about the program or anything to not about residence or the campus, please let me know.\n\nAnother quick question, is a bus pass included with fees?",

I was just enquiring about those electives and if one can take both ( I am very interested in both ) but it seems super intense, so it isn't smart. \n\nAbout the bus pass, I have seen some YouTube videos which said that it's covered in the fee. So, hopefully \ud83e\udd1e",

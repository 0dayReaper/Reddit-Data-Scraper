I struggled to work during the program and I was fully online. With you guys going back on campus most likely, I would say be optimistic with yourself and expect to not have much time. Nursing school is a beast.",

My biggest tips are listen to the lectures, take notes in whatever way works for you to learn the best. Use other things to study with!! Quizlets, flash cards, diagrams, drawings etc. \n\nI\u2019m both and neither at the same time. I have ADHD so every day is different! \n\nI never read the chapters in full. Too many pages. All i do is skim read and go over bolder topics or important notes.",

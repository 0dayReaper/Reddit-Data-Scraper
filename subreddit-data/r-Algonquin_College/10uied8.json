Upon graduating and passing the board exam, you\u2019ll be making 70k a year roughly.  I think the program itself is very well designed for the students, the only question is are you willing to grind.",

You can check the program website to know the high school requirements. If I not mistaken, need physics, chemistry and biology in High school. The AC-HPAT is the most determined factor, if you ranked top 5% of the program applicants, you\u2019ll get in, so doesn\u2019t really matter what your high school average is, as long as you get into the top 5% in AC-HPAT. And to be honest, you are competing not only students from Ottawa, but all over Canada and even International students. I wish you good luck.",

As the other commenter said, its got a heavy workload, but if you work hard and manage your time well it won\u2019t be an issue. Also for clinical placement, its not paid and its full time hours, so be prepared to work for free for an entire year. Not sure what your living situation is like, but I couldn\u2019t afford to live on my own anymore. Its excellent for the experience but it is long and exhausting. You\u2019ll have a bit of a say in where you\u2019d like to go for placement, but ultimately they decide for you with a lottery. It could be anywhere from in the city to far out of town, so be prepared to travel long distance if you need to. Best of luck!",

Otherwise there's a better chance at a paid co-op/apprenticeship/residency.\n\nSorry.",

It is very intensive during the didactic portion (have between 8-12 classes per semester) and the clinical practicum is 1 year long, unpaid. The clinical site is completely random, so you have to be prepared to potentially move temporarily to another city. Overall, it was a good program and I had three job offers before graduating so it's a great time to be in this career path! Good luck :)",

Then from there, they choose randomly. So let's say the most popular chosen site has only 3 spots for students, and 10 students chose it, they'll randomly choose 3 out of the 10 people, then the other 7 people are put into draws for their next site. I hope that makes sense lol\n\nI don't have a picture or my schedule unfortunately. I know that they've changed what classes are in each semester, so the schedule would look different from when I was in the program. If you have a degree or, you might be able to put a credit towards getting out of a couple of the classes (depending on what you took previously).",

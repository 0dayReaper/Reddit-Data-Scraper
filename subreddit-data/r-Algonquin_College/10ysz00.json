The college gets grants from the government for domestic students that covers most of the costs.  International students have to pay the full cost.\n\nI hope this tidbit is helpful",

And if you get through the program, you were basically guaranteed a job in the industry. At the time there was a huge focus on traditional work, which was what made the program stand out from others. Anim and layouts (backgrounds) were done on paper, but I heard that since covid, they've switched to digital mediums and no longer do the traditional 'on paper' method.\nThe industry doesnt use paper anyway though so that has a lot of pros to it and Im sure students are more comfortable using the computer programs at graduation than they were back when I graduated.\n\nIt varies by teacher. Some are really kind hearted and very talented and pleasant. Some are... terrible. They're amazing at animation and have a lot of stuff to teach you, but they're mean and insult your work.  I wont name any for obvious reasons, but typically I find that most teachers are good and alright, but you end up with 1 every year that will be the nightmare teacher. The program struggles to keep their teachers, since most are part time and it just doesnt pay them very well to stick around, so a lot of rotation happens. There are a few full time teachers that have been there for ages though. \n\nAs for job opperunities, the college works with the surrounding studios in Ottawa (of which there are 3 big ones, and a couple of minor ones) to help each student get hired. At the end of the year they hold (or at least used to, not sure if they still do since covid) a grad show, wherw studios around Canada would come and see the students work, as well as hunt for new hires. Most students would leave the grad shows with a few job oppertunities. Again, idk if they do the physical show anymore. I got hired at my show and still currently work at the same studio, as are a lot of my peers.",

I had one teacher in my first year pull me aside and tell me to completely drop out because \"I wasn't good enough\" and \"clearly couldn't do the program\". At the grad show, he apologized to me and shook my hand, to which I just coldly thanked him and walked away lol",

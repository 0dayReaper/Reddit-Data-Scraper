Calling upon Redditors of Algonquin to pitch in and give a clear picture of how the residence really is, it\u2019s pros and cons, whether it\u2019s worth it or should I go for off campus housing ?\n\nFTR: I am an international student so going to visit the campus is not an option atm \n\nTIA !",

            "comment": "Nice place. Rooms are big and the space is great. I loved the convenience of being right next to campus and being able to nap or go home between classes. Security is great, comforted my parents knowing we were safe and there was people to help at all times. My room was across from a stairway going down that was right beside a kitchen, so that was nice but not all of them are that close. Food in the residence cafe is pretty good. Walls (atleast for me) are cement blocks between suites and that knocked out a lot of the noise. Always have social events going on or free food, if you\u2019re into social stuff. I personally never went. The amenities like the study rooms and game room, movie theatre are nice but I never used them, only the study rooms. Never had any issues with the wifi, it was always good. \n\nOnly having to remember to pay rent 2 times a year, unless you get OSAP and it was automatic, was a huge plus. Not paying for utilities or wifi, or hydro. \n\nI enjoyed living there but there are some downsides, as always. \n\n1. Weed smell. Constantly. No matter where you go. \n2. Fridays and Saturday nights it gets loud and busy. Drunk college kids are a nightmare when studying for midterms. \n3. Being right near campus and having the convince to just leave did cause me to slack in some of my classes and choose not to go just because. Or getting up with barely any time to run to class. \n4. Roommate stuff. It\u2019s bound to happen. Everyone has an issue with their roommate at-least once. My roommate and I were on and off the full year and it\u2019s tough to life through BUT we are still friends now, 4 years later. \n\nOverall, if you\u2019re new to the city (I was, moved from a smaller town) and don\u2019t want to deal with the bus system or walking far, Residence is a huge plus and a great option for students.",

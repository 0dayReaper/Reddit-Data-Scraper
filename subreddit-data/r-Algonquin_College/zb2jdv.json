    "postText": "So I know this question gets asked here a lot but none really align with the context I have. I'm currently finishing up my undergraduate in finance and intend to enrol into one of the above upon graduation. My primary concern is regarding no coop vs coop for the two programs. Being that I am 22M, I am eager to begin my professional career and am leaning towards the web dev program exclusively for this reason. At face value, it seems that MDD seems more logical in the modern landscape but 2 years with no paid work experience or internships feels like a stretch for me. Are internship opportunities possible for MDD? Are there any more factors I should consider prior to enrolling ? Any advice helps TIA",

If you want to work with modern web technologies, there's no better program at Algonquin.  \n\n\nPrevious graduating classes typically have &gt;50% job placement rates BEFORE graduation, so the lack of co-op shouldn't be a concern.",

My focus has been general so forgive me review but I can provide some insights\nOn campus: when it comes to group work it\u2019s more discipline as the profs tend to give you class time and you know your classmates. \nSome ppl say that campus has a stronger work load expectations. My first term was campus and I tend to agree with this statement.\nOnline: the workload is less, and group work is a shit show. My program stated in September 19 before Covid so I had one opportunity for campus and the rest of my college life has been online. I do return for my final term in January as I have been doing co op the last two terms and I\u2019m choosing to be online. Hope this helps",

    "postText": "News broke today that the comp eng students will do their finals on-campus even though the rest of the semester will be delivered remotely. Seems fucking bananas to me.\n\nIs this happening in any other program? If it's happening to you too, did your program coordinator explain the rational behind the decision? Really struggling to wrap my head around why the computer engineering students will be required to do paper exams man.",

Recently finished the course overall, but they have been trying to crack down on rampant cheating that was already pretty bad pre-pandemic.\n\nHopefully students are able to get into the country for the exams. I know in my final semester many students opted to stay in their home country rather than come to Canada for the term.",

The reasoning we were told on a Brightspace for this was that it was to \"preserve the academic integrity and accuracy of our assessments.\"\n\nI'm not sure if they offered it for computer engineering but they offered us the option to opt out if we applied and got our exception permitted.  Though opting out did mean that we would need to be proctored, which personally I don't mind.  I'd give more info about what the application form looks like but they haven't posted it yet.  Should be up by the end of this week if I remember correctly.",

Alleles patent squares, proteins then physics newton's laws. Honestly those calculations were simple and straightforward if you know all the 3. Chemistry acids and bases, chemical reactions etc. I thought I knew chemistry but the way they set it made it difficult for me to answer. Maths not so complicated if you know the basics. You can practice for math and English on that testing thing accu something. Science you can't. Goodluck",

You could still for the month after and likely get the requirements but you are pushing it and should reach out to the coordinator ASAP.\n\nThis post is extremely unclear as your coop is a job and no-one can tell you if you should work when out of coop and just in school. That depends your budget and lifestyle.",

Typically it will be 4 months, I signed one for 8 months. After that, you will be back to school for the last semester.\n\nPart-time is ok when you study. I knew someone works a full-time position. you can have a try if you believe what you will learn is no big deal.",

If you have a car you can consider living in Gatineau especially if you have any french language skills since you will save between %20-30. \n\nIf you don't have a car or want to live close to the college then consider rooming with someone else in the Deerfield area as you can get a house with some friends in that budget. I would avoid renting from someone who owns a home since they tend to be really bad close to Algonquin.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a steady straight A student, when I ask for help it is to get a better understanding so I ask for a detailed explanation from my professors. This one prof has the nerve to tell me I need a tutor because she has apparently went beyond her means as a professor, which she has not. I have asked two professional accountants if i misunderstood and they have told me no that I have a clear understanding of the accounting principles. It\u2019s the lack of from this professor. As a student we aren\u2019t allowed to state the prof is not doing their job in teaching us but found her comments and suggestions absolute rude and insulting.",

I still managed to pull an A- in her class but ~7 months out I doubt I could remember a lot of what I \"learned\". Thankfully I wasn't actually trying to get into accounting, I just needed the course for the Office Admin certificate.",

The program is so short that it\u2019s not worth letting this take up to much space in your brain. Get all you can from your profs and get out of there without spending time with drama and ruckus. Remember - the dept chairs really do read those course evaluations from the students! Good luck!",

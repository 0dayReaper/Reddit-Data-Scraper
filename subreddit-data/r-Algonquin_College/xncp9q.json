    "postText": "So... it has been 3 weeks since I started the CET program here at Algonquin and I'm already having second thoughts. Although the program is going well so far, I noticed that there are many more students in the CP program. Looking at this report  [2017-2018-Graduate-Employment-Report.pdf (algonquincollege.com)](https://www.algonquincollege.com/employment/files/2020/03/2017-2018-Graduate-Employment-Report.pdf), it seems that the program's outcomes are similar, although I've heard the difficulty differs noticeably. The CP program sounds to be the easier one but also has a higher average reported salary.   \n\n\nSo my question is, would it be a bad idea to switch? But also I know what comes easy... goes easy. I would love it if someone could explain to me the focuses of each program and expected work environments.   \n\n\nAlso if I were to switch, would I have to start from level 1? or would I start in level 2? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance :)",

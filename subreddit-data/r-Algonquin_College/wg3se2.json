How was it? Also, it offers unpaid coop. Is this something that the college help us find or we're to find it on our own? \n\nThank you. :)",

Personally I enjoyed it and got a lot out of the program. \n\nAs far as the coop goes, the college helps you find that. At the end of the first semester you \u2018apply\u2019 for certain roles, and are sorted into teams of 3, sometimes 4 people. You\u2019re assigned a project with a real client. In the end you\u2019re left having created something that will be put to use by a real world client and you can put in your portfolio. The clients are never for profit organizations.",

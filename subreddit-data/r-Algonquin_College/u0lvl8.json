    "postText": "So I am starting the game Dev program in the fall (2022) and I cannot find any current information on device requirements. I have a powerful desktop computer at home but not a decent laptop. I'm wondering if I need to go out and buy a laptop? Will my desktop be sufficient for the program? I was planning to take notes and such in class on my tablet, but it's not powerful enough to complete assignments (the plan was to use the desktop but now I'm unsure?)\n\nAny info on this would be super helpful! \n\nAlso, what does the usual schedule look like? I'm trying to figure out what a typical week will look like so I can let my employer know \ud83d\ude02",

The computer labs are more than enough, and something for taking notes. \n\nAs far as your home desktop, it should be capable to run Unity or Unreal Engine, Visual Studio, and depending on your stream choice, 3DS Max and the Adobe stuff (Photoshop, Illustrator, Substance Painter). Don\u2019t worry about licenses for these programs, most of them have a student license you can use, just make sure not to activate these licenses before you\u2019re told to, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to use them when you really need them.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t expect to be doing lots of gaming in your free time if you want to excel in class, and strongly suggest you brush up on your math if you\u2019re not that good, specially trigonometry and matrix calculations (you\u2019ll relearn it, but it\u2019s good to have the foundation). Get a decent calculator too, nothing expensive.",

If you put in the effort, learn and take everything in, you could land in a decent job.\n\nI work for a Vancouver mobile gaming company as a technical artist. It's a great job, good pay with lots of perks. Ottawa doesn't have a big game dev industry as much as the big cities (Montreal, Toronto, Quebec City, etc), so you should consider moving if you really want to get in the industry. There's also remote WFH positions lately, but if you want real experience, being in the studio is the best way to get it.\n\nAlso, there's software that is an industry standard that wasn't in the program, such as Maya, Zbrush and Houdini, but if you know the foundations, it's easy to learn them on your own.",

Most courses are 3 hours a class once a week, exceptions being Programming Fundamentals which is 2 3hour classes and Math which is 2 90min classes (or was for me anyway, but they are doing some work on the Math class I hear). Oh and there's a Design Thinking class that doesn't have a class, it just releases content and assignments every week online and you do it on your own time (assignments do have due dates though).   \nSo all together its something like 18hours a week in class, a few more maybe for Design Thinking. The program is pretty heavy on homework and you'll have group meetings for Game Design. **I'm not great with estimates but I'd say total workload might be around 25-35 hours a week, depending on the week and how you do your homework.**  \n\n\noh if you were wondering about times, they can be all over the place there's really no way to predict until you get your schedule. You could have 2 classes back to back, or one at 8am and the next at 6pm.",

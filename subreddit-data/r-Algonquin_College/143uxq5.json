Ottawa is also filled with various \"clubs\" (off campus) for anything you can imagine (both City-run and private). There are heaps of opportunities. The summer on campus is a little bit slower than the fall and winter semesters, but the Algonquin College Students' Association website has lots of good information, as well as an events calendar for keeping up to date on the fun things going on around campus.",

Another thing Algonquin has is a lot of activities and clubs that you can join. And if you like bowling, golfing or rock climbing, we have a bouldering wall, a golfing simulator, and a six Lane, 10 Pin Bowling Alley. As well as if you like museums we have a ton of museums that you can go for free on Thursday in tonight\u2019s from like 5 to 8 PM. my favourite is either the nature museum or science and technology museum.",

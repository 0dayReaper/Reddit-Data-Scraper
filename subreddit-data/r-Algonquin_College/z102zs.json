    "postText": "Hi friends,\n\nI'm starting my 2-year law clerk study at AC in January 2023. I was wondering how the field placement in level 4 works. Are students responsible for finding their placement? (Like an ordinary job hunting (dropping off resumes, attending interviews)?) OR: Is the school going to provide a list of law firms/institutions with openings, and the students can apply and interview for the openings?\n\nIn addition, are there any groups (social media, forum, etc.) that AC law clerk students can join for networking? Currently I only found the used textbook Facebook page created by other member (thank you for doing this!), but I guess it's not really purposed for networking.\n\nFinally, if you're also entering the same program, feel free to DM me. Would love to meet people in the program prior to start.\n\nThank you!!",

I just tend to worry about things when I don't know anything yet :P\r  \nThank you so much! Will definitely reach out if there are more questions. \r  \nGood luck with your studies!",

    "postText": "I'm starting in September and I'm not sure of the workload. I have a very capable/ gaming PC at home that is able to handle the workload but I'm wondering if I should invest in a laptop as well.\n\nDid you guys find you were doing projects at school or more at home? \nIf I invest in a computer should it be to the recommended specs (from the Algonquin site: 16gb ram, i5 or equivalent processor) or can I save some money and do more of the larger workload at home?\n\nThanks in advance for any help and advice!",

            "comment": "Prof here, and I am teaching one of the level 1 course sections this fall. Since both CP and CET essentially have an identical level 1, I can speak for either programs.\n\nThey are BYOD (bring your own device) programs which means you are required to have a laptop.  I guarantee that there are in person demos for some of the material in both the programming and database classes.  Besides, what are you going to do during your 2 hour lab periods of which you have at least 4 per week? Especially with the profs that require mandatory lab attendance.\n\nNow to address the hardware.  There will be those who say that the required specs are overkill, but they are there for a reason. Having underpowered equipment can be a detriment to learning as performance heavy tasks will run significantly slower.  I know that Costco has some decent machines for around $1000-$1200.  Check out the sales in the other stores and maybe you can get a good deal since it's back to school season.  You might be tempted to cheap out and get a $750-$850 laptop, but there is a reason why they are that cheap.\n\nHowever, here is the short version of what you will need:\n\n- Windows laptop. **Don't get a Mac.** The new macs are not compatible with much of the software you will need.\n- i7 is recommended. However and to be frank, an 11th gen or newer i5 will do you just fine.\n- 16 GB of RAM. This is one of the more contentious item. Lots of former students will say that 8GB is good enough. I always recommend 16GB b/c Windows barely runs on 8GB.\n- 1TB SSD preferably an nvme drive. Speed is king\n- You don't need the dedicated GPU unless you are planning on gaming on this machine. All of the 11th gen+ Intel processors have built in Xe graphics.\n- 1080p display . I don't think you can even get lower res anymore.\n- Wifi (duh). Most of the classrooms do not have ethernet hookups\n\nOne of my kids is going through the CST program (which has the same hardware requirements) at this point in time and she has a 8th gen i5 and it is able to do the job, but it struggles a little. They are making up for it by having upgraded the RAM. They threw in a 16GB stick in the spare SODIMM slot and is now rocking 24GB of RAM. Also the hard drive got an upgrade and it just so happened that the laptop had a 2.5\" drive bay available so that got stuffed too. Grand total of the upgrades? about $300. Not bad for a 4 year old laptop.",

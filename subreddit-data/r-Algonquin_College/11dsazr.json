There are 6 semester programs that take 3 years too. It can vary from program to program. What program specifically are you taking?",

I started in Sept 2020 and had 3 back to back semesters until August 2021. Then the Fall term of 2021 was my break term. Then I went back for another full year (3 more semesters) from January-December 2022. :)",

Instead of a summer break, you get a fall break. People who start September 2023 will be graduating December 2025.\n\nThe website also has the contact information for the program coordinator and the clinical coordinator. If you need to ask questions about the program it would be best to ask the program coordinator Angela Nuelle. Her contact info is provided on the website. \n\nI also noticed under admission requirements it says \"Accepted applicants must complete ParaMed Requirements\" I recommend asking when they expect you to finish these requirements; they must be completed before clinicals. Based on the [program outline](https://www.algonquincollege.com/programdocs/1927X01FWO.pdf), I am guessing that they would want it done before January 2025. That seems to be when the first clinical starts (unless the class of 2025's program overview is different from the class of 2024's).",

There are ways to 'fast track' and some (most) three year courses would be three two semester blocks with two summers in between. \n\nOf course with fast tracking, exemptions, summer school and more online class availability it's really a question of your program, what's offered when and such.

A lot of us who graduated learned from sources other than the schools program.\n\nFor networking the Cisco material is top notch, stick with that, you cannot find better.\n\nFor Linux, Python and Windows the courses were pretty horrible, here are much better alternatives that teach the EXACT same thing we covered in class.\n\nLinux:\n\nCompTIA Linux+ XK0-004, 2nd Edition\n\n[https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/comptia-linux-xk0-004/9780135896860/](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/comptia-linux-xk0-004/9780135896860/)\n\nLinux Fundamentals, 2nd Edition\n\n[https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/linux-fundamentals-2nd/9780137929313/](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/linux-fundamentals-2nd/9780137929313/)\n\nPython + Databases this course taught us 5x more than the schools program. Its the worlds best free Python course. We even have new employees at work take it as part of their training.\n\n[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)",

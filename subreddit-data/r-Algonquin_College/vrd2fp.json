    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm going into the AMS program this year and I'm just wondering if anyone can talk a little bit about the program. I've seen an older thread in here about it but I want to know as much as possible before the fall semester!\n\nI'm also wondering if there's any materials or resources that I should check out ahead of time since I'm basically just hanging in Ottawa until the fall semester starts. Also, do we know if AMS needs to choose a GenEd? \n\nBasically please use this thread to rant/discuss/advise about the ASM program! And if you're in the same boat as me feel free to hmu! I'm new to Ottawa and kinda lost about everything haha\n\nThanks in advance people :D",

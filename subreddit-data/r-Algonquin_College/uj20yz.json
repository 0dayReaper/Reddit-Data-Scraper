    "postText": "So I purchased a textbook for a Spreadsheet Applications course, but then at the last minute, the college decided to change the required textbook. So then I had to spend more money to get the new textbook. They told me I can't exchange my old textbook for my new one nor can they do a buyback since the campus bookstore no longer has the policy.\n\nAfter basically being conned out of $100 by this college which I have loathed since before I joined it, I want to ask **is there a place either online or in Ottawa that takes used textbooks for money?**",

I'm going to hold on to it until next week just to make sure it really isn't required for the course, then I'll try to sell it. \n\nI'd say I'm surprised that Algonquin pulled this little bait &amp; switch and conned me out of $100, but this is the type of crap they pull. They create a problem and you can make it disappear if you give them more money.",

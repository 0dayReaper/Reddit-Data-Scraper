    "postText": "Hey folks, I've been looking into a career change and I was hoping someone could enlighten me on the Web Dev and MADD programs. They both look interesting but which one would be more employable in the long run? I've been told that its very difficult to get a job without co-op and I'm not seeing a co-op option for MADD. \n\nAlso I might be misinterpreting some of the course descriptions, does MADD require a lot of drawing and artistic capabilities? I can arrange UI and webpage elements in an aesthetically pleasing manner but I can't draw worth a damn. \n\nHow are the profs in the 2 programs? I was in CST many years ago and I had some awful professors who either obviously gave no shits about teaching or who were just not capable of teaching at all due to language barriers. I've heard that all the technology courses have their fair share of terrible profs and I vaguely remember years ago people complaining specifically about the professors and course content of Web Dev. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Ultimately the program seeks to make you a well rounded full-stack developer within the mobile context.\n\nIf you want to work with a modern stack of web technologies, there is no better program at Algonquin. The level of instruction is very high and many MAD&amp;D grads find full-time employment before even graduating.",

Sure it\u2019s intense, but you will learn everything you need to know about web design/development plus mobile applications.\n\nI\u2019m currently in that program, and the professor are amazing. They will help you succeed, and learn a lot.",

            "comment": "Currently in the computer programming course and there are a lot of similarities in this stream with your concerns.\nFirst the myth of not getting a job without co-op is just that a myth. Other factors come into play as more and more employers are looking for personality as well as the skill. As more things move to web base and application base, you will be very much in demand. Make no mistake the apply ratio is 100 applications to receive 18 interviews in tech is accurate and networking will increase those odds.\n\nAs for the profs, you are very much correct. There are some good ones and some bad ones. I am frustrated with how my early semesters went because of that issue. So it has not gotten much better and still currently the program needs to be updated for the material.\n\nWith either one of them you can\u2019t go wrong, so hopefully this information will help in your career pivot, but will present challenges no matter which one you choose.\nHope this helps!",

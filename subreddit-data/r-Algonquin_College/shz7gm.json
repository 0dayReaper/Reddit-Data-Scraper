You can read about the program and course overviews for Interactive Media Design [here](https://www.algonquincollege.com/mediaanddesign/program/interactive-media-design/).  You can also read the course outlines which go in depth into what the course will cover and include [here](https://algonquin.ecoursemap.com/CourseOutlineViewer/CreateSessionAlgonquin.aspx).\n3. There's [Computer Engineering](https://www.algonquincollege.com/sat/program/computer-engineering-technology-computing-science/), [Web Development and Internet Applications](https://www.algonquincollege.com/sat/program/internet-applications-web-development/) (formerly Internet Applications and Web Development), and [Mobile Application Design and Development](https://www.algonquincollege.com/mediaanddesign/program/mobile-application-design-and-development/) that come to mind.  If you have any questions about the Web Dev program I'd be happy to try and answer them since I'm in my final semester for it.\n4. If you mean motivation wise I'm not too sure.  If you're talking about academic restrictions I would recommend talking to the Admissions Office.",

I do meet the minimum requirements for the program, but I'm nervous about my math knowledge. Any suggestions on what I should do to prepare?",

My favorite resource would be [Ms Havrot's ](https://youtube.com/@mshavrotscanadianuniversit6234). This should have good explanation and questions for the first level math and second level calculus. Hope this helps!",

There\u2019s algebra basics, computer numbering (adding and subtracting binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers and Boolean logic), factoring polynomials, trigonometry, graphing polynomials and trig functions, vectors, and systems of linear equations. If you\u2019re curious you can look up those subjects. The second semester is calculus.",

    "postText": "Hello! I am thinking of applying to the cabinet and furniture making certificate program. I am having trouble finding information online. I would like to know things about the program. \n\n1. Is the program running for new applicants in 2023.  If so would I be able to join in September or is there a specific term to join in. \n\n2. What are the classes like? Is there a lot of history and theory work or is it mainly hands on experience? \n\n3. Would you recommend the co-op program and how long are the work terms? \n\n\nIf anyone has faculty contacts too it would be appreciated. I know there is a q and a scheduled for today, but sadly I have to work and cannot attend.",

We do traditional joinery, architectural millwork, log cabins, timber frames, stick frames, roofing and finishing. We learn how to make windows, doors, stairs. Feel free to send DM. Theres also Rosewood  in Perth for fine furniture afaik (alternative to AC). But it's pricey.",

    "postText": "So i recently just failed my Electrical Principles I Exam which means I failed the class. But next semester I have a Electrical Principles II. Since I failed the level 1 course, do I have to take it the following semester? and for the other courses I passed, do i just move forward with it while retaking the level 1 class?",

            "comment": "You won't be able to take any course that has Electrical Principles I as a pre requisit. It looks like you're in the Electrical Engineering Technogy program. If that's the case, the only courses that you will be able to take are DAT8921 - Introduction to Programming and PHY8201 - Environmental Impact of Technology. Your best bet would be to talk to your coordinator and figure out a plan going forward.",

I am currently living in residence and wondering if I should stay next year or move into an apartment. I\u2019m not sure of the course load that 2nd year has and so I don\u2019t know if I could manage a job. I have no savings and my residence was paid mostly by OSAP and then some help from my parents. Could I have some \u27282nd year wisdom\u2728?",

            "comment": "Hello! Animation Alumni here. 2nd year was by far the most brutal year... however my year was also the first year Covid hit and I know the program has since changed as a result. In my 2nd year we did all our animation traditional with pencil and paper. I've heard it has since switched over to digital, and I'm not sure how that changes the course load.\n\nI don't know anyone who was ever able to work and keep up with the program. It's very intense and eats up all your free time. \n\nIf you're not a member already, I'd totally recommend checking out OATS (Ottawa Animators Talking Socially) which has both students and industry professionals, and might be able to help answer some of your questions. Lots of students and alumni who were probably in your position. The website is [https://www.ottawaanimators.com/](https://www.ottawaanimators.com/) and there is a discord server as well (you might have to contact them to get an invite).",

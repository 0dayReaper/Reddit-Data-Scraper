    "postText": "I don\u2019t go to Algonquin, but I am trying to get one of the hoodies as a gift for a friend. I\u2019m having trouble finding the entrance to the store(Connections?^(I think)) on google maps. I\u2019m assuming going through the Student Commons? Also where would I park for free, paying for such a short visit seems silly. I don\u2019t mind walking from the College Square lot, if that\u2019s the only option, TIA!\n\nEdit: Got the item I was looking for! Thanks to everyone who had suggestions. Your campus is pretty great I love the walking bridges between buildings over roads and the Student Commons building was pretty nice too.",

            "comment": "Yes, you can access Connections through the Student Commons building.  It's at the intersection of buildings E, D, and H.  Just go in the main entrance of the Student Commons (Building E) and go straight.\n\nThere is not much in the way of free, legal parking near the college. You can park at College Square but you run the risk of being ticketed if you are spotted leaving the parking lot (they monitor the paths to the college).  You can also try the Baseline Station Park and Ride if you get there after 11.  It fills up quickly, though.",

It's $4 an hour I believe.\n\nYou can definitely take a chance on college square.  I recommend parking over by the Loblaws garden centre and then ducking into Loblaws for a few minutes so that anyone watching doesn't see you go directly from your car to the college.  Same if you want to try Home Depot.  Don't make it easy for them and you should be fine.",

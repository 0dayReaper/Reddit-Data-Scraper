    "postText": "Hello everyone, so as the title says, I was wondering about transferring from Carleton over to Algonquin. I'm studying English, but I haven't been enjoying it as it's a lot more of the technical/historical/read-between-the-lines type of English and I'm a much more creative person. I've actually been finding a lot of the assignments very difficult, and I've dropped courses multiple times, prolonging my time there and being miserable all the while. I know there's a creative writing program with a certificate attached at Algonquin, and as this is a kind of on-a-whim thought, I haven't looked too hard at what else is offered. I'm going to keep looking into it, but in the mean time, any advice/words of wisdom?",

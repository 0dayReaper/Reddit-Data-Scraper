            "comment": "Hey everyone. I'm currently a level 3 MADD student (in semester 3 of 4) and just wanted to give an honest testimonial of my experience so far.\n\n* **Zero coding experience:** Although I had some prior coding experience, a lot of my classmates didn't, and most did very well. Everything and anything you need to know to get started as a developer will be taught and explained to you. Not everything will be taught in the class, but you are supplied with an endless amount of resources and guided on how to use them. The best guidance comes from going to class. The classes are very interactive, will guide you directly to an A+, and teach you how to use any other resource to quickly and effectively learn what you need or want. By the end of the 1st semester, you'll be able to build any good-looking and functional single-page application connected to the internet and use APIs. You'll be impressed by how far you've come in just 3.5 months. \n* **How intense is the program?** It's pretty darn intense! Not as intense as a BootCamp, but pretty close. You will learn a lot. You will feel overwhelmed from time to time. But you are never alone. There's lots of help available. The professors are very nice, flexible, and will do anything they can to help you understand. But you must speak out and ask; don't be shy. I've learned so much by asking seemingly stupid questions and listening to other people's questions. In your first year, you will also have 2nd-year students that you can reach out to and you will also have 2 hours per week with one of them in small groups to go over anything you'd like. These upper-level students are called program assistances (PAs) and are paid to be there for you. We use Slack to communicate so you can ask questions 24/7 and you will usually get a prompt response from a prof, a PA, or a classmate.\n   * Time management is key. Not missing classes is extremely important. They help you so much to stay on top of everything. You'll quickly notice that missing just 1 or 2 classes will add stress and make assignments seem much harder than they really are. \n   * Avoid having a job or anything thing else that eats up a good chunk of your time if you can. I promise you it's worth it. Immerse yourself in the program and you will have no issues getting a well-paying job when it's over.\n* **Jobs:** Every time I do a job search, I always find way more postings than I can read. Out of the ones I do read, I feel very qualified for more than half of them. Try searching Jr. developer on LinkedIn or Glassdoor. You'll be happily surprised. I got my first job right after completing my first year. It was a referral from one of my professors. I was hired as a Python developer on a machine learning project. No, MADD does not cover Python or machine learning, but it taught me how to read documentation quickly and effectively to work with any language or technology. Within 2 or 3 weeks, I was up and running in my new job. I was the only dev on my team that was comfortable using git and github which really gave me a leg up in the company. All thanks to everything I learn in MADD.\n* **Up-to-date:** It is incredible how up-to-date MADD is. Steve lied a little when he said they update the material every year. They actually update it constantly. On more than one occasion, profs have changed upcoming assignments in the middle of the semester because something better and newer became available. Our textbooks are basically just blogs that are updated almost daily. The effort that is put into keeping the program up to date is unprecedented. This was the biggest selling point for me. This industry is moving so fast, it seems that no one really cares what you know, they care more about what are you able to learn and how fast can you learn it. See my job experience above.\n* **Connected:** I feel very well connected just by being a student of this program and eventually alumni of it. It's the best way to get jobs and they're usually better jobs than the ones you find through traditional sources. You will become connected to so many people in the industry and you'll hear about the latest and greatest things that are happening and you'll hear about jobs looking to be filled almost every day. This is probably the most valuable takeaway from the program.\n* **Would I call myself a full-stack dev?** Definitely! This is a very well-rounded program. My full-stack also includes design skills, which is a very rare thing in this industry. Although my preference is in backend and some frontend, I feel comfortable taking on a role in UX/UI, frontend, backend, or even something else, such as machine learning.\n* **Would I call myself a mobile dev?** Definitely! Everything we learn and build has a responsive and mobile-first approach. We do cover iOS and Android native dev, along with other technologies such as Cordova, React Native, and PWAs. These are my favorites because they allow you to write an app once, and then deploy it on multiple platforms. It's great!\n\nHope this info is helpful to someone. Let me know if you have any questions I can answer from a student's point of view.",

            "comment": "Hello Professor Steve, I am a graduate at Carleton University in Philosophy and I am very passionate in solving problems through a logic based application. Luckily, I stumbled upon programming (basic HTML, CSS, Javascript) during my many days spent at home due to the pandemic and I find it very exciting and rewarding to do as you can immediately see the results of your work as you progress through your codes. I am very interested in Front End development and UX design as I would like to solve client/customer user interface problems to facilitate access and use of web apps, mobile apps and websites. Though, from the research I've been able to do (which may be misguided in my humble opinion) I find that becoming a Full Stack developer offers you wider range of skills and therefore, exposure to more job opportunities with a company/start up or as a free lancer. \n\nThis research lead me first to believe that I should apply at algonquin College for the Web Development and Internet applications Certificate with a Co-op. Though, as I do more research regarding students who have completed the program the most reoccurring theme I find is that the material is either very basic or outdated and the teachers aren't as resourceful as they ought to be considering the Web Development field is rapidly changing and evolving. The Co op exposure seems to be the selling factor for entering the program for past, current and future students. \n\nNow, I've had a look at your program in as much details as I could along with one of your past students reviews on it and the questions you've answered on this thread. This leads me to my inquiries; How does your program compensate for its lack of a Co op, is it \" The Real Life Project/Applied Project\" ? Second, could you elaborate on how you keep the program up to date in this rapidly growing field ? Third, does your program offer a thorough foundation for Full Stack developer with an obvious emphasis on Front End and Design web applications. Lastly, do you offer career services specific to the program that would help and guide students in landing a job ?\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read and answer this long painstaking comment. Your answers will greatly help me in figuring out which program I will apply to for a start date this coming fall 2021.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for your questions.\nI have taught in the Internet Application Web Development program as well as the Interactive Media Design program and the MAD&amp;D program, so I have a unique perspective on this.\n\nI would not characterize the graduates from IAWD or IMD as full stack developers. IMD gets the fundamentals of web design but it is almost entirely client side. IAWD focuses heavily on the back end and, as you mentioned, older technologies. \n\nMAD&amp;D aims to make students into Fullstack developers and mobile application developers who also have good design skills. IAWD does very little with the UI and design.\n\nWe get students who transfer to MAD&amp;D from both the other programs. The ones from IMD are looking for something more in depth. The ones from IAWD say the same things as you mentioned. We have never had a student leave us and go to IAWD. We have had a few who found MAD&amp;D too hard who went to IMD.\n\nIn my opinion, co-op is for students who need more training to get a job. Far too often tech coops, that students have to find themselves, get students to do basic repetitive work.\nOur Applied project course gets students to work with live clients and experience the whole project lifecycle on real world projects.\n\nThe way we keep up to date is by constantly updating the curriculum. I spend half my time doing research, learning new languages and frameworks and talking to friends in industry. We update our courses every year. It is the only way to keep our program relevant. \n\nThe College has a career services office that helps students with job searches. However, the majority of our graduates have no problem finding work. Our program is fast-paced and very intensive, so the graduates are in high demand. If you make it through the 4 semesters, you will be industry ready.\n\nAs an example, this year we have 35 graduates. Last week was the final week of school. At that point 12 of them already had jobs.",

They tend to get hired very quickly and don't go on to do a CS degree afterwards. \n\nI've had a number of companies tell me, after holding rounds of interviews, that our students are much better prepared to work than any of the CS graduates that they interviewed.",

Currently I am focused only on the MAD&amp;D program. \nThe difference between them is that IMD has a broader focus. It is more of a generalist program. It moves at a slower pace and does introductions to more topics.\nMAD&amp;D is a faster paced more intensive program that is very focused on fullstack web design and development and mobile design and development. It goes deeper into the topics and is more challenging because of that.\nThe employment statistics for MAD&amp;D are much better. Making our graduates ready to walk into an industry job at the end is our primary focus.",

            "comment": "Hello professor I appreciate you setting up this thread as it has answered a lot of outstanding questions. To give some context about myself, I am graduating from my Finance undergrad this upcoming April. Certain circumstances have led me to become extremely passionate about the tech space with a primary focus on becoming a full stack dev. I have been accepted to the WDIA program and am now having some doubts as people have mentioned the program is somewhat outdated. My selling point is essentially the co op experience as I do see it as valuable and have had friends in the WDIA program enjoy their co op experience. My main question is, what's MADD's stance on interning outside of school? Is it common for students to seek employment during time off ?",

If students focus on their course work and the technology, then by the end of the first year, they are employable as web designers and developers.\nWe definitely have students who work full time and part-time during the summer break, using the skills they learned in the first year.\n\nWe intentionally did not add co-op to our program because our students don't need it.\nIn the final semester, they have an applied client project building a real world solution for a live client. We find that this process teaches and prepares for employment much more than a co-op does.",

The reason why I chose this program is that I'm really interested in front-end development and IAWD seems to meet my expection for that.  However I do have a second thought on this after reviewing a lot of comments regarding IAWD.  \nI would be greatly appreciated if you can answer my questions as follow : \n1.  How many international students are in MAD&amp;D program and how is employment rate for international graduate students on average each year? (compared to IAWD that offerd coop)\n2.  Is there anyway to transfer to MAD&amp;D in the beginning of first semester? \n\nBest regards\n\nXia Sun",

The last two graduating groups had about 25% employed before classes ended and that was over 50% within a couple weeks of finishing class.\nOur employment stats are as good or better than many programs that have coop.\nThere is no transferring directly from any program into MAD&amp;D. You will be starting in level 1 because we are very specialized and because of the rapid pace of our courses.",

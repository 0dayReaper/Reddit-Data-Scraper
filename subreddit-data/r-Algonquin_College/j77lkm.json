    "postText": "I just wanted to share some information regarding Honorlock, an anti-cheating software, and wanted to mention some of the things that Algonquin College isn't telling you about when it comes to their solution to monitoring online exams. I don't exactly know what programs will use Honourlock for testing since they didn't really tell me when I inquired, but I'm pretty sure it thankfully doesn't include every program. Even profs don't seem to know much at this point, but I could still see the college trying to pull a fast one and have people find out last minute. It wouldn't hurt to try and inquire to the following email: [foicoordinator@algonquincollege.com](mailto:foicoordinator@algonquincollege.com)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer and therefore anything posted below with legal reference is not intended as legal advice. If you need legal clarification, then I would suggest contacting a lawyer and welcome legal clarification in the comments. The goal of this post is to provide information about the proctoring service that Algonquin College would almost definitely not include in their information provided to students.  It is also to provide as much information as possible to the student can form their own opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlgonquin College might be telling you that they respect your privacy and that there's nothing to worry about, but there's a lot of conflicting reports that have been published about this software which has often been referred to as a spyware tool. They'll tell you their side of the coin because they made that decision to go with that software. It's always a good idea to look at different perspectives and a perspective that isn't motivated to reinforce their decision as to why they chose this route. I've included a link on the next line that addresses those concerns.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/seanlawson/2020/04/24/are-schools-forcing-students-to-install-spyware-that-invades-their-privacy-as-a-result-of-the-coronavirus-lockdown/#a7c0d19638d8](https://www.forbes.com/sites/seanlawson/2020/04/24/are-schools-forcing-students-to-install-spyware-that-invades-their-privacy-as-a-result-of-the-coronavirus-lockdown/#a7c0d19638d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first major concern is obviously privacy. I'm sure Honorlock takes security very seriously and have good systems in place to make the software as secure as possible. Reality is that doesn't guarantee security and people have the right to be wary. I've posted a link at the bottom of the page of an article written about the Ashley Madison data breach. That company thought they had really good security. My point is that this company collects a lot of information about each student and stores it for a period of time they describe as \" as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected\". Some of the information collected, which is for the duration of when it is being used, includes: video from your webcam, the student's screen, microphones, your search history (I assume only limited to that time period) and information taken from any secondary devices. In the privacy policy they also mention that they may collect operating system information, carrier information, location information, network type, IP addresses, URL's with date and times, amount of time spent on pages, cookies and \"any other related device information\". Other personal information may include first and last name, email address, LMS user ID, \"all Authentication Data (including personal information contained on a Student\u2019s photo ID, such as driver\u2019s license number, home address, date of birth, and other information)\".[https://honorlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Honorlock\\_App\\_Privacy\\_Policy\\_032020.pdf](https://honorlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Honorlock_App_Privacy_Policy_032020.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondary device monitoring is also something that the college probably didn't tell you about. On the terms and conditions (link below) there is a whole section that talks about \"Secondary Device Detection\". The company claims that they don't monitor network activity, but they are still able to detect multiple devices on the same network. They do this apparently with a 3rd party company \"Inspectlet\" \"and \"other third party service providers\". The reddit link below talks a lot about that. I've also blocked off a section talking about \"Inspectlet\" and their terms and conditions.[https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/fwxx2x/is\\_anyone\\_else\\_super\\_suspicious\\_about\\_honorlock/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/fwxx2x/is_anyone_else_super_suspicious_about_honorlock/)\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn relation to Honorlock I don't know how \"Inspectlet\" or other third party service providers use the information collected, but I've included the inspectlet terms of service below the paragraph. While Algonquin claims that Honorlock doesn't sell your personal information, their 3rd party service provider states conditions in their terms of services where they do. I don't know what it means, but under section 3 of the terms and services, this is what stands out.\n\n&gt;3. Information Sharing and Disclosure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Inspectlet does not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about You with other persons or entities, except with Your permission, as described above, or under the following circumstances:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**(a) Customers.** We may provide to our customers who are using the Services the names, e-mail addresses, and usage data of visitors to the customer\u2019s website(s) from which such Personal Information was obtained. The customers may use such Personal Information only in accordance with this Privacy Policy and their own privacy policy or terms of use governing the website from which the data was obtained\n\nThere's also a section closer to the top that says the following:\n\n&gt;\"If You reside outside the United States, You understand that Your Personal Information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing personal information may be less stringent than in Your country. \"[https://www.inspectlet.com/terms-of-service](https://www.inspectlet.com/terms-of-service)\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnother thing that stood out for me was Honorlock's terms and conditions (link below this paragraph). One of the sections I find troubling is the \"class action waiver\" part that waives your right to participate to a class action lawsuit if anything were to happen. I don't know enough about the law to know if it applies to all jurisdictions or not. If yes, this essentially puts you, an individual, up against a company with resources to deal with these kinds of situations. Below is the link to the terms of services. A lot of what I used in this post comes from that pdf document created by them. From a legal standpoint, I don't know if this means Algonquin would assume responsibility since they are essentially the ones waiving our rights.[https://static.honorlock.com/legal/Honorlock\\_Terms\\_of\\_Service\\_Students\\_GDPR.pdf](https://static.honorlock.com/legal/Honorlock_Terms_of_Service_Students_GDPR.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is the FAQ link from Algonquin College focused to teachers, but there is also a link to the student version. While it's good information to have from the school's perspective, you'll also notice the wording is slightly different at the beginning of each answer. For example, for the question \"Am I being watched the whole time?\" the prof's version of the answer starts with \"Yes and no\" vs the student's version \" According to Honorlock, the answer is \"Yes and no\". Despite what I posted above, this is still valuable information to read up on. Keep in mind that it is from their perspective and their point of view.[https://www.algonquincollege.com/lts/proctoring/faq/](https://www.algonquincollege.com/lts/proctoring/faq/)\n\nThe goal of this post is to make people aware that Algonquin College may not be giving you the full story when they try and downplay the concerns surrounding this new tool. I wanted to provide as many sources as possible that explain Honorlock from a perspective other than theirs and the school's. I've provided additional links below. Some describe specific situations that happened, while others are just general information. It's up to every student to make up their own mind and if enough students have concerns with this information then it is up to a collective student body to raise those concerns. It is worth mentioning that other schools have reversed their decision to use Honorlock because of student voices.\n\nIf students raise concerns about this software and Algonquin College decides to continue pursuing this route then it might be worth making a post on how to protect ourselves from Honorlock. There are ways to minimize what information that can be taken, starting with a VM. VPN's apparently won't work though. Regardless, it's always a good idea to find ways to protect your personal information.\n\nOther links:[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/)\n\n[https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/09/honorlock-at-uw-madison-presents-privacy-concerns-perpetuates-harmful-learning-environment](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/09/honorlock-at-uw-madison-presents-privacy-concerns-perpetuates-harmful-learning-environment)\n\nAshely Madison Data Breach Links[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericbasu/2015/10/26/cybersecurity-lessons-learned-from-the-ashley-madison-hack/#1bacc0444c82](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericbasu/2015/10/26/cybersecurity-lessons-learned-from-the-ashley-madison-hack/#1bacc0444c82)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley\\_Madison\\_data\\_breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach)",

My concern is hundreds of students graduating who haven't been honestly studying and doing the work and have \\*no idea\\* what they're doing and just have a diploma or degree in name only. Even in in-person there were a ton of people whispering and passing tests to their friends. The profs didn't seem to care or notice. I just got out of a Zoom class where we could all hear someone's friend whispering them the answers and it was going unaddressed.  \n\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest concern isn't security of some random search info- it's academic integrity in the education system.",

There are other things going on as well - personally my biggest priority when interviewing someone is assessing whether a person can think, ask good questions, understand responses/hints, and generally how they collaborate. \n\nSomeone who's been passing notes and copying off their buddies' exams will fall flat in an interview held by anyone with a basic level of confidence. Those people will go on to call their alma mater \"garbage\" who \"didn't teach them anything\" and \"didn't help them get a job.\"",

I have had so many exams before COVID where people are clearly cheating and they didn't seem to do anything about it. You would be writing your exam and you would hear talking around you and all that would ever happen would be warnings. The school even has a 3 strike policy in which you need to be caught cheating 3 times before they kick you out.   \n\n\nI don't see how they really cared all that much about cheating before hand so I don't see why they chose to go with the most intrusive method to try and prevent online cheating. As mentioned, there are other ways to achieve the same results.",

I also feel like Algonquin College is purposefully selecting what Honorlock information they tell students...which lacks integrity.\n\nIn the case of other Universities using it, some schools have abandoned the idea to use this kind of software and have come up with alternatives.",

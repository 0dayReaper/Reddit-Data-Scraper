My classes ranged from 7 am and then i\u2019d have classes later on the day, day from 11am to 1pm then you might have the afternoon off, i do remember some classes starting at 5pm and staying till 9:00pm but it varies, i\u2019d wait till august to see what your schedular is like and then try and go work around the hours. i\u2019ll see if i have an old pic of my timetable and send it to you!!",

You\u2019ll have to allocate a lot of time learning outside of class. It seems pretty easy at the start but gets more difficult. If you can manage your time wisely, do the readings, and quite honestly just keep up you should be fine!",

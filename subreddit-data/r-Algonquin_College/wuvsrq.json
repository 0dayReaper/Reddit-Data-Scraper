Often depends the class and specific teacher.  \n\nMost hard copies don\u2019t include a e book, but you can often find the electronic versions for free if you look hard enough or can get them from the library as a rental.",

Last semester i had two, one i had to download a specific program to read the damn thing and it didn't have any accessibility features to make the font bigger or change the font (dyslexic with poor vision), the other used a website that was fine for 80% of the semester but the last three weeks the site was unusable because of how many other students were trying to use it at once to study. \n\nI much prefer physical textbooks, i am able to use my blue overlay sheet (highly recommend for those with dyslexia), i can use a quecard to make sure that my eyes don't skim lines, i can make notes on the page and use sticky notes for my thoughts. plus they are big and heavy and make me feel like im doing the author a solid for buying a physical manifestation of their hard work.",

Often the E-version of the textbook is required for evaluations.\n\nSome courses with eBooks the publisher will have an option to purchase an additional hard copy (either a \"real\" textbook or a looseleaf or less \"pretty\" version) for a fee of 20-30 dollars.  It's a good option if the eBook is only a one year \"rental\" and you like the book and want to keep it longer.",

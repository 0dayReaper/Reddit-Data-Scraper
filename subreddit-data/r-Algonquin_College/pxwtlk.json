    "postText": "Algonquins letter grades will be rounded down by some colleges. My A+ (92%) average is seen as an 85% to Cambrian. My goal was MRT which at Cambrian has an 86.25% cutoff so it\u2019s impossible to get accepted no matter my grade. \n\n\nEdit: the point I\u2019m trying to get across is that if you\u2019re not sure exactly where or what you want to take after the pre-health program, look into the pre-health programs at other Ontario colleges with numeric grading systems to keep all your doors open. If you\u2019re dead set on going to Algonquin afterwards, AC pre-health is still a fantastic program.",

            "comment": "They've been pretty clear since week 2/3 that a lot of colleges don't recognize the pre-health program as a substitute for prerequisites.  AC has arrangements with some colleges (st lawrence, Queen's, uottawa) but schools outside of their agreements are a crapshoot.  Even uOttawa and Queen's have a very low acceptance rate for pre-health students.  It might've changed from when you took the program but they have been very blunt and upfront about this.",

The issue is not that my classes don\u2019t count as prerequisites for the advanced diploma programs I\u2019m applying to, It\u2019s that the grading system Algonquin used is not consistent with other colleges. \n\nIt\u2019s just something I didn\u2019t imagine would ever be an issue.",

Bortolussi is teaching Careers and she's been brutally honest about our prospects, which stems from past students blaming the program when they aren't accepted into other college/uni programs.  \n\nIf you had planned to apply to a different school, it would behoove you to talk to *their* admissions dept. first instead of assuming that you were set up to fail.  I believe that was also addressed during a zoom q&amp;a.  It could be stated more clearly before you apply, but the website does state \"meeting the eligibility requirements for a number of *Algonquin College* programs\" and there's a disclaimer that it does not guarantee acceptance into any health sciences programs.\n\nI'm sorry it didn't work out for you but \"*they made it seem like\"* sounds like you made an assumption without checking into it.",

You may be putting too much blame on Algonquin while the other schools are the ones who didn\u2019t accept the grading system. Several other schools use the same system or similar with -/+ including Centennial, La Cit\u00e9, St Lawrence, Seneca etc. I think you ended up with a crappy deal because of the schools you applied too. It\u2019s unfortunate that it happened but a negative post doesn\u2019t help the situation, esp when the facts are on the website, PHS is designed for Algonquin and select universities programs. \n\nThey are required to tell you to apply to other programs too. And no prof would ever tell you specifically to apply just to Algonquin because that isn\u2019t correct. Competitive programs mean a lot less spots for people. If you did well in Pre Health you shouldn\u2019t have any issues getting into any program if your choice. They\u2019re \u201cinterchangeable\u201d to an extent. Each college creates it for their own programs with the expectation that they\u2019ll get students from this program!",

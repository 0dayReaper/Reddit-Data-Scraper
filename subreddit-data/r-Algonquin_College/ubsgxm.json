This is an older post as it says \"We will not be able to advise students about new hardware until the 14\u2033 or 16\u2033 MacBook Pros with the M1X chip are released\".  On the site its still showing \" 2021/2022 Academic Year\" https://www.algonquincollege.com/mediaanddesign/program/mobile-application-design-and-development/#fees\\_expenses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI start the program this fall but updates for fall aren't out and it's not easy to get a laptop that loaded on short notice",

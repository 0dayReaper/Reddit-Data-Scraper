Are mature students able to apply for residence? And if so how does the matching process work for roommates?",

The roommate process was really easy, you fill out a little questionnaire about yourself and then about two months before move in they open up the selection. The school will give you suggestions of who they think will be compatible based on your questionnaire. They give you the option to message with people before you select who you room with. If you have any other questions or want some clarification you can message me :)",

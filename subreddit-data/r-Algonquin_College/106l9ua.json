Most nursing groups have a FB page or an Instagram page (that\u2019s what our section has had!)\n\nIf you\u2019re interested; not related to a discord but a few of us graduated students run a Google classroom for nursing students with resources, textbooks, videos, notes, PowerPoints and more. It was aimed at the RPN program but useful for the RN program as well. If you\u2019re interested in joining, shoot me a message!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nIm an accounting student and I chapter review assignments on Connect. \n\nIt says that I have only one attempt for review assignments. \n\nDoes it mean I can\u2019t go back and go over my answers again once I\u2019m done the assignments? \n\nI can see the wrong answer when I answers the questions but doesn\u2019t stick with my mind until I go over them again but it seems it goes to the next question and I can\u2019t go back again to the previous question I did. \n\nAny help?",

And Ankit doesn't mark if your calculations are necessary 'right' as long as you know what to add ( and some spots where you would do 30% cca, etc)\n\nI just googled profile software. It just made it easier to recognize all the different forms. Since some have multiple  different variations",

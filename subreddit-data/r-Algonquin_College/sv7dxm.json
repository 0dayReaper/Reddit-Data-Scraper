So as long as you follow along and do your labs as soon as they're assigned to ask professors questions you should do alright.  \n\nWith that being said, I would recommend looking at the [course outlines](https://www.algonquincollege.com/plar/courseoutlines/) for each course in the program.  That'll give you a better understanding of what you need to study in advance.",

    "postText": "I got accepted into the paralegal post grad program for Fall 2023 and have accepted the offer. Other than the email saying I got in, I haven\u2019t heard anything from Algonquin\u2014 which is quite the opposite of when I got in my undergrad program. Is this bc I haven\u2019t paid my tuition deposit yet? Or is it just because it\u2019s too early in the year? \n\nTIA!",

Marcia Green (the program coordinator) will reach out to your class with all the necessary details.\n\nI\u2019m in lvl 2 of this program so if you have any questions feel free to dm me!",

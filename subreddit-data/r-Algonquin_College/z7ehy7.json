Will he find trouble finding a job without it ? - Thanks a lot",

Most people I know who didn't take co-op ended up going to uni or staying at Algonquin for another degree in the same field mostly to do co-op because they have none.",

            "comment": "In case anyone is coming to this thread later with the same question, I will give my experience as a graduate from the non-coop online program. I read the same talk about how important coop is, and I just wasn't in a position to take the in-person classes, so I went non-coop.\n\nI graduated with a nearly perfect GPA. I live in Ottawa, the so called \"hotspot\". The diploma has been completely useless. I've been looking for a job for months. There is zero, and I mean zero, demand for inexperienced programmers. The people who are telling you that programming is \"in demand\", actually mean that experienced programming is in demand. And that's just for in-person jobs! Remote jobs are 10x harder to land. If you're hoping to work remotely, genuinely give that up right now. The recruiters I've talked to have all made it very clear that remote work is so competitive right now that you will never get it as an intro position.\n\nUnderstand that you will need to put a ton of work into your professional portfolio to be able to get a job. My portfolio is just okay, it's nothing amazing. I have a nice big project and then a handful of smaller ones; not good enough. I found the program to be already quite hard, as most of my classmates did who were new to programming. I wasn't really able to work on the portfolio on top of what I was doing in school. I was too busy doing 4 person group projects solo because they'd give me groupmates who lived on the other side of the world who also don't speak English (literally).",

    "postText": "I've been so exhausted as of late. Only sleeping 3 hours a night and I crashed this afternoon and woke up at 9pm. I had a scheduled exam for 6:30\n\nI should mention, the exam is worth only 10 percent and my final grade is already a B-\n\nI'm not going to beg for a makeup unless I absolutely have to, I can live with my grade as it is but I want to be sure I won't fail because of this. I emailed my professor of of course, but I'm not expecting to hear back from them until tomorrow. I mostly just want reassurance in the meantime because I'm the type of person that can't stop stressing over these things.",

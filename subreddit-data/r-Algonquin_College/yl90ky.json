The only transcript they take into account is High School. Reason being is 95% of the time the requirements are based on High School marks. \n\nYou are able to get all A's in College and go into a pathway into University only if the High School requirements are met. Your College mark only matters if the University asks for them.....Even then they don't care if you have an F, as long as you have retaken the course and passed it. \n\nF is just a grading letter that affects you moving forward in that particular school and program. This also goes for A's it does not matter to anyone except you. Passing is passing regardless of the mark. Courses have different passing requirements, that's why I DIDN'T say 50% is passing regardless. \n\nAs well, the Academic Penalty date is November 11 for Algonquin College. If you withdraw before you get a W on your transcript instead of an F. Talk to your SSS regarding withdrawing from the Program and Academic Advisor/Program Coordinator regarding dropping courses \n\nI hope this helps clarify everything and put you at ease. You set the bar for yourself. Passing is Passing\n\nGoodluck",

I wanted to know if it was possible to transfer from Algonquin to the computer engineering degree at the University of Ottawa. I have not completed a one-year programme. And it says on this page, \"If you have less than one year of college, you may be admitted based on your high school grades.\" which the marks are high 80's.  I don't care if my Algonquin credits transfer or not; I just want to start a new computer science programme. I have a high school diploma (Class of 2022), and my grade point average in college preparatory classes was 3.9. My ambition is to attend the University of Ottawa, therefore I was just curious whether it was feasible.",

High marks are great but sometimes people work their ass' off to get those high marks and GPA but in reality it doesn't help. So, in short my suggestion is to look at the requirements. \n\nThere are no secret/hidden requirements. Even when programs are allowed to pick and choose which student they want they will tell you. TO BE CLEAR: the only situation that would happen is if both of the following are true: (Colleges Only)\n\nThe program is labeled as \"\"Highly Competitive\" \nYou applied AFTER the equal consideration date\n\n\"Some programs offered by Ontario colleges are considered highly competitive, which means that there are more qualified applicants for the program than there are seats available for the fall start date.\"\n\n\nGoodluck! I wish you the best.",

The best option would be to drop the course and retake it. If you withdraw, you'll get a W on your transcript which won't affect your GPA. Either way, if you drop the course or fail, you'll have to retake the course to pass your program. Better to do it with the least amount of overall \"damage\".",

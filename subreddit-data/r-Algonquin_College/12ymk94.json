            "comment": "Hi there! As someone who recently graduated, I want to share some advice/tips that helped me throughout my experience in this program:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Go easy on yourself and allow yourself to grow**: You are new to the field, and mistakes are inevitable. It's important not to get lost in the need to 'know everything' at once. There will be areas where you will excel in and others where you won't. Be patient with yourself. You have time to find your niche.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Don't hesitate to ask for help**: This was something I struggled with in the program. However, when I finally began reaching out to classmates and professors more, I felt more at ease with my work and progress. Learning design and development can be overwhelming, but you have an amazing support system of classmates and professors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Work on your portfolio:** Start on your portfolio! This is where you'll be able to really personalize your work and showcase your skills. Create your portfolio so that it reflects your personality/aspirations and highlights where you do well the most in terms of dev/design tools.\n\n  \nI am really happy I took this program and pushed myself to learn new skills and pursue my passion in design and development. \n\nYou've already accomplished so much by being in this program. Don't be discouraged by the difficulties you may face; they are all part of a learning experience. And don't allow self-doubt to hold you back in building this rewarding and fun career!",

The program is intensive but you have access to some of those most helpful and supportive staff at Algonquin, so use that to your advantage and ask questions. \n\n- In my experience, the program cultivates a mature learning group. For example, this year\u2019s graduating class\u2019s average age was about 28-29. So if you\u2019re a mature student looking to re-skill, I think it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be surrounded by like-minded individuals.\n\n- The program is on the smaller side (number of students) so you really get to know one another and your teachers. As someone with previous post-secondary experience, I can say that the relationships I made during this program are much stronger than the ones I made in my other program.",

            "comment": "Graduate of the Mobile Application Design &amp; Development program here as well. I've chatted in DMs with several people about the program, so please feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions. Here are a few of my thoughts:\n\n* The program largely focuses on full stack web development using JavaScript, with some additional courses on programming fundamentals, UI/UX design and native mobile development.\n* The biggest advantage of the program is learning from a constantly updated modern curriculum, taught by incredible instructors that deeply care about the quality of the education students receive.\n* If you're interested in learning and using modern technologies like React, React Native, Flutter, .NET MAUI, Swift UI, etc. there is no other program at the college (to my knowledge) that teaches these topics in depth like MAD&amp;D.\n* As other commenters noted, the curriculum is intense and (IMO) is the equivalent of a full-time job throughout the entire two years. That being said, there are ample opportunities to receive assistance if you are struggling at any point throughout the program.\n* When you graduate, you'll have the tools and skills to learn how to build virtually anything you can dream up. This was my original goal when entering the program two years ago and today I feel ready to tackle any development challenge that comes my way.\n\nIn summary, if you are interested in learning web + mobile development and want to focus on modern techniques and standards in a condensed amount of time, there's likely no better accredited program in Ottawa. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I recently completed the two-year MAD&amp;D program at Algonquin College. As an international student, choosing the right program that will help increase my chances of getting a permanent residency is a tough decision. But I know that selecting a program related to tech should be a top choice and among the tech programs in Algonquin, I was drawn to MAD&amp;D the most because of its design and development aspects.\n\nA design subject taught me UI design principles that work best on mobile devices. There is also the UX side of design where I learned the process of understanding the user\u2019s needs, creating prototypes, testing my designs and getting feedback to ensure that I am satisfying the needs of my users. In my opinion, the design aspect of MAD&amp;D is the differentiating factor that will help graduates stand out from regular programmers. An added bonus is that graduates can be employed as UI/ UX designers or web designers. \n\nThe programming subjects are without a doubt challenging, especially for someone new to learning how to code. I learned programming languages like JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin and C#, but the program is heavy on front-end JavaScript and its frameworks. I did learn back-end development in one of the semesters. Despite the challenges, nothing beats the satisfaction of developing an application that works. It is pure bliss. \n\nOur batch seemed to bond well in our last year despite learning remotely in the first year. We had the chance to collaborate as a team and work on a client project. This enabled us to experience a bit of a real-world scenario of working on a project before we are released into the wild. \n\nSo if you are passionate about programming and you want to supplement your skills with design to be a better developer, then MAD&amp;D will give you this perfect combo. It will greatly help if you build a habit of reading documentation, watching tutorials, asking questions and practicing what you learned. All the best! \n\nCheers!",

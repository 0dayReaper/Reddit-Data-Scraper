    "postText": "I am going to be graduating this month and have found it wildly difficult to find any job that does not require at least 2 years of experience. I am not a coop student which obviously may set me back a little in pay grade, yet anything I find that doesn't require experience is minimum wage or extremely close to it. Does anyone have recommendations/tips to finding a good paying job that doesnt require 2 years minimum experience? I have been feeling stuck and lost and am losing hope of finding a job within a year of graduating I almost feel like this education was a whole waste of time and money if im only to be getting minimum wage regardless.",

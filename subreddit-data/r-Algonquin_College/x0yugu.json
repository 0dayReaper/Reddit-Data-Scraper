The only reason I would think it necessary is for certified programs connected to professional associations (nursing, aircraft maintenance, etc.)  Even then, the fact that you graduated means you met the required hours for professional certification.\n\nTry the program coordinator.  A name should be listed on the program's web page.",

Saying that please keep in mind your overall mark is what is kept all the cumulative marks that add up to your final grade are not needed after grades are posted. \n\nIf there is a specific reason you need the marks please mention it when and if you talk to the Program Coordinators. That added information will shine a light on the question.",

(I have a Mac currently, I'm hoping not to have to buy a PC...)\n\nthanks!",

In my experience, I never really read the books for most of the courses except for English Fundamentals, Spreadsheet Applications and Bookkeeping (God forbid).\n\nThat's another thing too, the bookkeeping course is just the worst. It's totally mismanaged and disorganized and the teacher as very poor people skills. She doesn't read emails properly and basically told me that  1 out of every 50 students pass her course. The teacher is Barb Wright. If she's still there, I'd make clear to her that your paying for this education and therefore she works for you.\n\nThe teacher for the Interpersonal Skills course also has poor interpersonal skills ironically.",

I just reviewed the grades data for the Bookkeeping course (ACC2207) from the last two years , and can tell you that the vast majority of students pass the course, with a very significant percentage of them finishing in the \"A\" range. :)",

The school's designed to make people anxious among other things and considering her lack of people skills, yeah maybe that's her way of motivating people.\n\nAlso LizHagemeyer\\_AC, when a student provides a feedback survey on a course, the facilitator and course materials does someone actually read that or does it just go into a blackhole that no ever looks at? Just curious because Jane Wright is still there and hasn't seemed to have improved her interpersonal skills after I along with a few others provided feedback on her delivery.",

She never replied the one time I emailed her about an F that got posted for an assignment that wasn't due for another month. The mark was removed from Brightspace, but she never actually replied.\n\nEdit: Also in Level 1 the textbooks for Business Math, Computer Presentation Applications, and Document Production were necessary. Two of them came with necessary access codes and the other came with the workbook that outlined instructions for every assignment. But Administrative Procedures and Interpersonal Relations textbooks barely got cracked open after the first week and I still finished those courses with an A+ and A respectively. Easy peasy.",

I'm in the process of deciding now, and have to select one soon. I don't want to accidentally pick a course with a heavy work load lol.",

            "comment": "Based on the current textbooks required for this program, you're looking at somewhere around $1400 for the whole Office Administration - General program if you purchase them all new (physical copies) from the college bookstore. If you opt for the digital textbook rentals through the college bookstore it would be closer to $950ish. These numbers do not include the cost of the books for the Office Administration - Executive program, and also do not include the cost for any textbooks for the elective course.\n\nYou can look up the cost of textbooks for individual courses here: [https://www.bookstore.algonquincollege.com/main-nav/books/search-by-course](https://www.bookstore.algonquincollege.com/main-nav/books/search-by-course). Keep in mind that you are welcome to acquire the textbooks through other means (ie. not the college bookstore) if you prefer, but you will need to make sure that the books include the accompanying digital access codes if applicable.\n\nThe Office Administration programs are BYOD (\"Bring Your Own Device\") programs, which means the program has certain requirements for the device you are using. Unfortunately, Office Administration is listed as a \"No Macs\" program. You can see the requirements listed here: [https://www.algonquincollege.com/byod/programs/#o](https://www.algonquincollege.com/byod/programs/#o). Some students get by using Macs, but they may need to rely on software that will allow them to run Windows, which is not always reliable. As another poster already said, there won't necessarily be exceptions or supports available for students using Mac computers if using a PC (or at least Windows) is listed as a program requirement.\n\nI am a Student Success Specialist for AC Online, so I have encountered students in this position (ie. they already own a Mac and want to avoid purchasing a PC) quite frequently. If finances are tight and you are not in a position to purchase a PC unless absolutely necessary, my advice is generally to go ahead and use the Mac for now... but with the understanding that you may reach a point where the Mac will not work, so you would need to be prepared to quickly go out and acquire a suitable PC if that happens.\n\nI hope this helps!",

Currently employed at that same place with the title of addiction counsellor. Also returned to Algonquin and am doing the addiction and mental health graduate certificate about to graduate that. I am considering various other options part-time because why not.",

Did placement at the ottawa carleton detention centre which was interesting but I realized it was not the career for me.  \n\n2nd placement was in a foster care home working as a child and youth worker which I enjoyed and jobbed out (got hired during placement).  Stayed working as a child and youth worker for 3+ years/short stint as a foster parent before I pursued other opportunities that paid better.\n\nYou wont get rich but the work is rewarding.",

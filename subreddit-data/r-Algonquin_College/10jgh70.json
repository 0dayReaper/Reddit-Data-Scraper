My coordinator said failure to maintain the GPA of 1.7 will result in academic sanctions for the subsequent semester, such as reduced course load or to change into part-time. I guess she wanted me to reduce the courses so I can take my time to study.",

Utilize the support services available to you through The Library and Student Learning Centre, the jump from studying in high school to college can be challenging for many but unlike high school, you need to take the first step to get additional help. You got this!",

Do the readings and take notes. Work on assignments well before they are due and if you get a bad mark, talk about it with the prof",

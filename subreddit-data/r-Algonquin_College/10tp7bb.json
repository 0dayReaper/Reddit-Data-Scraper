    "postText": "Hello everyone. Hope everyone is doing well.\n\nAs i am going to take AC-HPAT test tomorrow. just little bit confused and frustrate about the physics and chemistry. being medical student from past 6 years, i am quite good in biology portion. But, it seems physics and chemistry is damn crazy. anyway just a quick question. considering my last day of preparation, what you guys will recommend topics from chemistry and physics? so i can quickly review them. what is the imp topics which tested in exam?\n\nThanks !!",

I took my time and finished in less than 2.5 hours.\n\nI admittedly didn\u2019t do great on science so I probably can\u2019t even tell you too much of what to study. I\u2019d be familiar with all the basic physics calculations (force, velocity, torque, wavelengths). I\u2019m bad at chemistry so no idea. Definitely some questions of nomenclature, calculating atoms from moles, etc. \n\nI searched comments in the subreddit for HPat and found it all helpful. I\u2019m 10 years out of my undergrad science degree and got 38/60 with a heavy dose of educated guessing \ud83d\ude2c I was pretty stressed but found I was as best prepared as I could be. You\u2019re probably as ready as you can be.",

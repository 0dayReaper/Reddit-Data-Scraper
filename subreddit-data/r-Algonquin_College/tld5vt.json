Cost a ton to move for no reason (other than my new roommates are friends and not in school) and took me months to find a new job.   \n\n\nAre you switching becuase you dont live in Ottawa and need to take another online program?  \n\n\nAs for applications you might be able to talk to your program coordinator about moving to another one, they can often get you switched internally so you dont have to pay for the application service again.",

Take that food bank bag that may have one or two meals at best and turn it into 5-7 days worth of belly filling, spirit lifting food for your family or just for yourself that you can be proud of. Just because you're poor doesn't mean you don't have value. I'm going to try and inspire you to cook well for those you love it will boost everyone\u2019s ego to sit down at the end of the day to a beautiful, tasty meal. And no one stretches a dollar better then me! so let's cook!\"\n\nwhat I need are regular food bank baskets delivered (because I am disabled and a home body in the winter) I'm not only asking for myself but the \"Chef prepared\" food can be passed on. I just need authentic food bank baskets to show how to meal plan and prepare. Some I'll keep but most can go back out to the community. so if I can get a Ottawa On. native to join me in my channel to bring me food and take prepared meals back out to the community I think we could help a lot of people.  \nPlease contact me if you're intrested [d\\_welbourne@live.com](mailto:d_welbourne@live.com)",

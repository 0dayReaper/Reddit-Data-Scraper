You\u2019ll get an invite once you apply.\n\nThe challenge comes from the application for next years program. You\u2019ll most like need a minimum grade for biology,\u201d (most health programs are 65% I believe) and you\u2019re ranked almost solely on your HPAT score, with grades coming second.\n\nGood luck!",

I believe systemic racism exists, but the severity of its effects and ability to be remedied is certainly up for debate.  The statistics are not one sided, despite both sides claiming so. Serious people of color agree with her (Loury, McWhorter, Fryer, Elder, Carol Swain, Woodson, etc.). \n\nI can see cowards at state schools turning their backs, but shame on Earlham for not sticking up for discourse.\n\nhttps://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2020/07/10/rcs-board-member-and-husband-apologize-podcasts-racism-discussion/5412522002/",

With current politics being so hyper-polarizing right now, Earlham College had to make a swift decision. I do believe everyone should be open to there own opinion but the rise in \"Cancel\" culture has gone viral. I do believe it was an out of spite decision of getting rid of RadioTroy right away. Earlham wasn't the school to sever ties with RadioTroy also Richmond District, Centerville, and others. If this were to happen outside of such a polarizing election, it could have ended different but with an immediate apology.   \n\n\nI'm happy to talk about this further!",

It doesn\u2019t matter what you \u201cremember\u201d, it\u2019s a new era, we believe in the values of equality and radio Troy wasn\u2019t upholding them to the standard at which we envisioned.

Tell that to the people that are dying because of all of it. This isn't a case of Earlham \"not sticking up for discourse\" but of Earlham standing behind students who don't want to have a bigot calling their sporting events.",

Consider that according to FBI crime statistics over 50% of murders in the US, year in and year out, are committed by 6.5% of the population. Guess which 6.5%? Consider that 95% of crimes committed with a gun in NYC, where I live and work, are committed by two groups. Guess which two groups? Consider that 6.5% of the population murder over half the policemen killed each year. Guess which group? These are not opinions. These are verifiable facts. Check it out yourself. Guess which 6.5% murders over 5K of their own group each year? If you were a cop, would you be apprehensive when you encountered one of the 6.5%? Wake up, cupcake.",

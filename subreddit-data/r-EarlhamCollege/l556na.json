She's one of my favorite people in the world, and I'm sure can get you in contact with the right people (the aid department was never particularly helpful to me). Hopefully some former international students can chime in and help you out, too. When I went my parents weren't really able to help at all. I will say it is a pricy school, but their endowment is pretty big iirc. There are also scholarships specific to international students. Hope that helps a tiny bit? Good luck!",

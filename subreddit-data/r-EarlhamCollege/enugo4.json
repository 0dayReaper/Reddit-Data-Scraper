            "comment": "Hey! I'm a junior here at Earlham College, and I'm a student that identifies as a minority ( I hope that still conceals my identity to an extent). Please, not these are all of my opinions. The atmosphere is excellent, I like how my peers can force change through administration and the friendless of the campus. A couple of weeks ago, we were invited to have a chat about the student housing situation, which allowed for both sides to be heard. Also, it's a friendly campus, and people are always saying hello to anyone and everyone. That's one thing that drew me here to the campus. \n\nMost students aren't Quakers. I believe it's about less than 10% of the student population are Quakers. But the school does base a lot of there policies over Quaker beliefs. I'm personally Christian and don't have any backlash. It's very open-minded here.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. Love talking about Earlham, Sports, and Fintech",

Not judging, it is just the case.\n\nWould it bother you that Earlham spends about half as much per student as other liberal arts colleges? Former Bard College and Harvey Mudd Presidents have pointed this out.\n\nAre you certain to go to graduate or professional school? Earlham does not have a professionally staffed career office. I personally have never gone on a job interview where the interviewer has ever heard of Earlham. I work in Manhatten. Things may be different in Indianapolis. Would this bother you?\n\nEarlham has been losing money for a decade. Probably won't go out of business as Earlham had an endowment of $0.5 billion before it went in the red annually. Endowment size reflects the fact that Earlham has short changed ($0.50 on the dollar) students for years. Does this bother you?\n\nEarlham's marketing propaganda borders on consumer fraud. If Earlham says Mary or John graduated and now hold jobs at XYZ Corp., think Mary or John's grandfather owns XYZ Corporation. Would this bother you?\n\nRichmond Indiana is a cultural wasteland. Do you care about this?\n\nEarlham's faculty has been in decline for decades. Earlham has exhausted their reputation.\n\nEarlham loves to use transfer labor onto students under the ruse of \"community.\" This particularly offends me. Students pay 40K per year to provide uncompensated labor under some notion of \"community.\" Again, would you be happy in a commune?",

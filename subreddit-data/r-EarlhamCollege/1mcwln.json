            "comment": "Not sure if you meant to post this to the Earlham-wide thread, but it looks like mutations can cause proteins to be inserted into a membrane in an improper orientation:\n\n\"A striking demonstration of the importance of the flanking charge in determining membrane orientation is provided by neuraminidase, an enzyme in the surface coat of influenza virus that has an N-cytosol-C-luminal orientation similar to the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Three arginine residues are located just N-terminal to the internal signal-anchor sequence in neuraminidase. **Mutation of these three positively charged residues to glutamate residues causes neuraminidase to acquire the reverse orientation: N-luminal- C-cytosol.**\"\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21731/\n\nThis is for neuraminidase, but I assume a similar mutation could occur in a transport protein as well.

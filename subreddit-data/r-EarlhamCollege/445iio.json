    "postText": "This protesting is such bullshit guys! I completely understand wanting a more racially diverse staff but do you realize that 30% of the staff and proffesors are going to lose their jobs that they have worked INCREDIBLY hard for to make room for these demands? Think about how any of you would feel if you were released from your job because the company you work for is not racially diverse enough. Whether either of you are black, white, oriental, hispanic, indian or whatever. THATS racism! Its people like those that started these protests that keep racism alive and well. If your proffesors are seemingly racist, report them! Dont get 20 other GREAT proffesors fired because of your ignorance! Just saying!",

No, the demands of the students are for the college to ensure that the staff and proffesors are at least 30% people of color. I find THAT to be racist.. ",

I'm not entirely sure that I can do that with CSS.  I'm gonna open up an ideas/thoughts/feedback thread for these kinds of suggestions soon, as mainly I've been just changing things the way I like them (see Yay/Boos)  :-)\n\nEDIT:  Figured out how to change the alien to a different logo... just need to make the logo, which is the harder part.",

Do you think you could resize it down some... it is a ridiculously large logo as is.  :-)  If you want to add reddit as well [here is the template](http://static.reddit.com/reddit.com.header.png)\n\nI tried resizing it at work with just Preview... but that seems to add a black background to it .  Thanks!",

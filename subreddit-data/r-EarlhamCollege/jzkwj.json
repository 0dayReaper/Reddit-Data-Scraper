    "postText": "Hey Earlham Redditors!  With our newly founded Cyber Heart, we should add flair beside our usernames, because Earlham is all about the fucking flair!\n\nAdd what you'd like your personal flair to say to this post and I'll work on getting it added.  If it is taking more than a few days, just PM me as I've probably overlooked it.  I think it'd be nice for us to all have class years as well, to have an idea of the range of years we're dealing with, but if you don't want it, that's cool.\n\nIn the future I'll update as I remember and learn new coding, which I know very little about to begin with, but hopefully I'll be able to add a little more exciting colors and such.  I'm also not opposed to changing users' flair as many times as they want, but be patient.  You should probably PM me to have an already set flair changed.",

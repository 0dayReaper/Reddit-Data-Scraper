That means he was active duty when he helped steal the documents and took them to Mara-Lago, and was retired and receiving benefits when he lied to the FBI. Wouldn't this mean he is also subject to the UCMJ and a court-martial? If so, it doesn't matter if he flips or not, he's fucked. In fact, flipping could hurt him even more as he'd have no defense.",

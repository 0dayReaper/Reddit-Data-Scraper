Every single activity you've ever done that you've enjoyed has caused a release of dopamine in your brain.  Laughing at a joke.  Playing with your cat.  If you had fun, it caused dopamine.  \n\nThese things aren't addictive though, because the definition of addiction is something that you find difficult to stop doing *that causes you harm,* like how sugar gives you diabetes, or gambling makes you lose all your money.  Not simply any activity that is associated with increased levels of dopamine in the brain.",

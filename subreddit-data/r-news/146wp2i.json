If Russia cannot present the Ukrainian counter offensive as victorious for themselves, Putin will be under pressure to blame someone. Prigozhen is setting the narrative that Shoigu is entirely responsible. He does not antagonize Putin, which indicates to me, he still sees the overall government as staying. But his path is ousting the Shoigu wing of government. \n\nMeanwhile Shoigu is under pressure to explain Russia's failure and the Wagner Group and the Bakhmut battlefront is likely meant to set up Wagner for blame. \n\nI don't believe he wants to take over, I think they are just playing musical chairs on a sinking ship.",

Most people feel as if Putin surrounds himself with not very liked and well under qualified people so he can proactively avoid someone making an attempt to take any of his power. If that\u2019s the case, Putin would definitely not let Prigozhen take the job. Plus I do think it being a \u201cprivate\u201d group lets it be more brutal tbh",

But, mercenary forces were indeed common and thus had no inherent loyalty besides money.\n\nAlso of note, Machiavelli was from Florence, its own tiny Kingdom. This was before a unified Italy as it was a bunch of City states, so his perspective was very much centered around those times. It's quite a fascinating point of history.",

Do voters expect the President and the President alone to ensure that when they go to the DMV they don't have to pay a bribe to get anything done? That when they go to Court to sue the DMV the judge isn't also holding out his hand? No.\n\nUS and many Western institutions work because the society works. It works well and like clockwork with little corruption and dysfunction, and little appreciation for why it does. But no voter goes through their daily life engaging with institutions and places praise on the President for keeping it that way. They just expect it. They can't imagine anything else.\n\nRussians view their institutions and government through a reverse mirror image. They're politically nihilistic. They see dysfunction and corruption in the very fabric of society, it's expected, it's like air. It's never worked and, to them, never will because they know society at large is broken. Some people (Navalny) are pointing fingers at Putin, but most people aren't so idealistic. \n\nThey're poor, they're tired, and many beaten down from a life having to navigate the mess. When like is hard and unfair, many understandably just keep their heads down, focus on their family, focus on what they can control, and ignore/writeoff the entire political realm.\n\nThe Russians who aren't poor and aren't beaten down by contrast, don't number enough to meaningfully change the system, and also by definition benefit from it. They don't want it to change.\n\nThen, add a heavy dose of propaganda, national shame for the loss of previous legacy, and pride for former greatness, and you have a populace with an inferiority complex heavily susceptance to propaganda.",

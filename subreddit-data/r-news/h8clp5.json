The person then takes it to his editor (presumably) and it gets approved as a narrative, and then it goes out.\n\nThere is no other descriptor for this other than malicious propagation of misinformation, or information presented with intent to mislead.",

It's all about the headlines and what \"you\" think they mean. The whole BLM thing being completely misunderstood by some who then get bunched in with the ALM fucks and not even noticing why this is so damn wrong. Or the same with the Defund the Police thing. They just hear it, interpret it as getting rid of any law and order alltogether and go on the barricades (or twitter). \n\nAnd then you have people on the other side being tired of having to explain it or simply expecting that everyone arguing against it is doing so in bad faith. Maybe they then leave a pissed off comment and suddenly someone who would actually be in support of reducing police spending and putting it into social services, is getting pushed into the right wing. \n\nI wish there was just some kind of reckoning where everyone had to come together to face a common enemy, then learning that they aren't actually all that different and that there was simply a small number of truly evil bigoted fucks who create chaos.

Back in the day my dad was super worked up about some horrible photoshop of a picture of bin laden hanging in Obama's office or something. It was quite literally one of the worst photoshops I have ever seen and he was convinced it was real.",

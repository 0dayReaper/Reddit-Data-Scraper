This is an almost cartoonishly racist person, who unequivocally believes his white skin and ancestry puts him above black people, and he UNDERSTANDS, very clearly, that his position as a police officer puts him in a position to exercise those beliefs. He UNDERSTANDS the protests are about taking away his ability to do those things free of consequence, and he simply wants to fight back, so that he can keep doing... well, what he said he'd do. \n\nSo basically his racist beliefs are as batshit as all racist beliefs are, but he has a scarily reasonable understanding of using the institutional position he is given to exercise, feed into and perpetuate his racism and institutional racism at large. He knows very well what he has to do so that he can get to bring, and then keep on bringing his \"vision\" into the world, and that is protecting his most precious tool (his position as an officer) to fulfill his agenda.\n\nThere's a clarity of goal, plan and execution there that is... terrifying. \n\nThese are domestic terrorists infiltrated within american institutions and paid for with taxpayer money.",

There is no reason to ask for a fake \"race\" on an official document.\n\nThe whole patriotic indoctrination needs to come under question as well. You are witnessing the result of decades of US propaganda. Contrary to public opinion most of those racists didn't choose to be racist. They were manipulated with highly effective [propaganda techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_techniques#Specific_techniques). They are basically brain washed. Not all Germans suddenly decided they want to kill Jews. They were manipulated as well.\n\nedit: I watched A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood before. The US society needs more Fred Rogers.",

They literally stumbled upon this. Meaning the shit they try to hide is probably much worse.\n\nAlso, Wilmington has a black police Chief now that the officers reference here. And they discuss other black officers. \n\nNever forget, Wilmington, my hometown and the town I sit in today, is home to the only successful coup of an elected American government in 1898 by armed white insurrectionists: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_insurrection_of_1898",

At one point, Moore said at first that not all black people were bad, Piner replied \"most of them are\", and then Moore responded by saying \"90 percent of em.\" When Piner talked about going out and killing black people during a race war, Moore said he wouldn't do that. And when Piner continued talking about murdering another black person, Moore responded with \"you're crazy.\" \n\nWhile it's obvious that Moore is definitely racist, he seemed to gauge how racist he was going to sound by playing off the racist as fuck remarks of Piner. But even when Piner went all-out with his racism by excitedly talking about wanting to murder black people, even Moore couldn't agree with him. That's how fucking insanely racist Piner is, his rhetoric was way too fucked up even for his fellow racist coworker. And to seal the deal about Piner's insane bullshit, he didn't deny saying any of that shit, and tried to blame his behavior on the stress of the current political climate...\n\nJust the same excuses that all of those white people who have called the cops on black people minding their own business. If you claim that you only said racist shit because you were stressed or fearful, then you're actually just straight up racist.",

The mayor and police chief are saying \u201cdon\u2019t paint all the hundreds of other officers with the same brush\u201d... but this was heard on a RANDOM accidental recording. What are the odds it would record the only three racist cops on the force? And there are other officers who these guys hate for showing restraint - it\u2019s nice to hear that - but their silence is complicity.",

Your behaviour with a rifle in a combat zone in the Marines or Army is taken much more seriously than being able to brandish a firearm and shoot unarmed civilians on the streets of the US.",

They did not deny saying any of the things heard on the video. **Each officer pointed to the stress of today\u2019s climate in law enforcement as a reason for their \u2018venting,'**\u201d according to the investigation. \n\nHuh.  I've worked in a fair range of industries, and I've had some stressful jobs.  A couple of them were far higher on the \"most dangerous jobs\" list than police officers.  Once I was overseeing a seasonal agricultural operation that demanded 100+ hours a week of coordinating dozens of workers during particularly inclement weather, and after several weeks of it I thought I was going to go insane from the pressure and non-stop stress.  I once worked security at a rough place in town and had to intervene in some physical altercations more than once, one which involved a broken bottle that sent a guy to the hospital and another to jail with an attempted murder charge, and I was up until 4 AM talking to police, and then cleaning up blood.\n\nNot once did I go into a tirade about securing assault weapons to engage in the mass murder a specific ethnic group in a fantasy civil war.  Not even close.  I think the worse I did was neglect to walk my dog after a shift because I was just too exhausted to stay awake.\n\nThis dude isn't stressed out, he's a racist, psychopathic terrorist.  Glad he's fired, but disturbed that he'll still be out there, still thirsting for blood.  Left wondering how many other cops like this there are who haven't been accidentally outed from a recording their superior officer stumbled upon and actually had the conscience to do something about.",

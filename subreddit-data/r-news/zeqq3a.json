To meet our requirements to be considered news, a definitive outcome needs to have been reached. Political posturing, such as a politician making a remark about a certain event or policy, are not allowed. Political procedure, such as a bill being introduced in a legislative body for review, are not allowed. A piece of legislation being signed into law, or the results of an election being finalized both are definitive outcomes and would be allowed per our rules.\n\nThis is for submissions only.\n\nSo you all can stop reporting this submission now.

They voted for the name, which is exactly what the GOP was hoping for. The GOP was just expecting more than 3%. Thankfully, more people are starting to pay attention and vote in their interest rather than for a name or party. That's the only way the people can regain some power from the wealthy/corporate America. Regular people don't have the money to buy their politicians, but luckily, there are a lot more regular people, so we just need to vote for the politicians in line with our best interest. Unfortunately, that's not always a very clear choice.",

My street is interesting, all the old farts are conservatives who lived there when the houses were $150k, but as they retire to Florida, they sell their house for $500k to progressives from CA/MI/the northeast. We\u2019ve got a ton of corporations down here who need smart people. My neighbors are 2 UX designers, on the other side one is a P&amp;G chemical scientist, the one behind us is an aeronautical engineer who makes jet engines for GE. Smart people who tend to vote with their brain, not Christ or emotion. \n\nLong story short, Ohio has a better political future than, say, Florida (which attracts every old fart who gets as conservative as possible before kicking the bucket).",

I didn\u2019t want to talk about that too much either, because I was disappointed by voter tabulation. I think it\u2019s disgraceful what happened. We were like a third-world country on election night with the closing down of the centers and all of the things that happened late in the evening, and he was furious at it, and many people are furious. You don\u2019t know how angry this country is \u2014 and people were furious. But he was \u2014 he was somebody, at the same time, you know, he thinks about the past, but he projects out to the future. That was Rush. I mean, he wants to learn from the past and get things fixed, but he was \u2014 he was somebody that really felt that was a very important victory for us. We should have \u2013 we should have had it, that we did have it, but he was somebody that felt that was a very important election, and I did too. I mean, I did too. You see what\u2019s happening now.\n\n----\n\n&gt;FAULKNER: You know, I \u2014 I\u2019m curious, Mr. President, what did you talk about with Rush Limbaugh, if you had the opportunity before he was too ill to do so, about what might be next for you? He seemed \u2014 and I know because I\u2019ve talked with him \u2014 he is a man of vision.\n\n&gt;PRESIDENT TRUMP: Right.\n\n&gt;FAULKNER: But, he also \u2014\n\n&gt;PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes.\n\n&gt;FAULKNER: \u2014 likes the art of what is coming next that you can\u2019t predict.\n\n&gt;PRESIDENT TRUMP: True. Right.\n\n&gt;FAULKNER: But, did you talk about that?\n\n&gt;PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, he was truly a man of the future. He loved this country so much. He loved the people of this country so much. He was so happy with what we did, we rebuilt the military \u2014 you know, all things that he \u2014 that he liked. We cut taxes, that we cut regulations, which maybe is even more important than the tax cuts, frankly. That\u2019s why we built that foundation that can propel us, if it\u2019s not messed up. But Rush was just somebody that \u2014 he loved talking about the country and the future. He was very much a future person. And he was very proud of the country. He was very disappointed by certain things that happened in the country and that, you know, just have been happening in the country \u2014 very, very disappointed.",

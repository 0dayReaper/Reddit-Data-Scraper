I can honestly say that Watergate influenced my thinking about politics and politicians profoundly; more than any of the three actual impeachments have done or will do. Lots of people asking what it was like back then: it was surreal, a President hiring burglars to break into the opposing party's HQ? Shit like that wasn't supposed to happen in this country. It was a shock to most everyone I knew. For myself, a year away from being of voting age, it was a huge awakening, I never, ever went back to trusting my government again; and that colored my view of politics forever. Also for me, Trump wasn't really a shock - many many experts predicted something similar would happen, even before he took office; many of us regular folks always feared him having power (I'm so thankful no military crises arose while he had the final Nuclear launch say) as well.\n\nBut the last 4 years has been way, way worse than Watergate. I never actually feared that my government would go totally off the rails back then. Now we have congress members aiding and abetting Nazis and White Supremacists. Federal Legislators endorsing fucking *Nazis?* Promoting violence towards the free press and protesters - and now against anyone who opposes their power? Watergate was weak sauce compared to the last 4 years. Please, if you take anything away from recent events: remember to vote, encourage your family and friends to vote, and never take for granted that the better person or candidate or party has enough support without you.",

Constitutionally they will have to vote on the impeachment. Trump will be a private citizen 24 hours after the senates recess has ended.\n\nThey can proceed and complete the trial even after Trump has left  office, the main goal would be to prevent him from ever holding office again. They won't be able to remove him before inaguration day.\n\nAnother edit on the consequences of an impeachment:\n\n According to the [wikipedia page on impeachment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States) a conviction will not strip Trump of secret service protection but will prevent him from receiving his presidential pension.\n\nThe senate must also vote with a majority vote( senate praxis is usually a  2/3 majority) on barring him from holding office again.",

They can also vote to strip his post-presidency benefits and to bar him from running for or holding future public office, which will be relevant if he is somehow not behind bars by the next election in 2024.",

It's also the only major website still devoted to independence from corporate control. Sure there will always be some problems, but to me Wikipedia a beacon of what people back in the early 90s wanted the internet to be like.\n\n(Edit: grammar fix)",

I have never had any regrets even with the slight downgrade.\n\nThere was that awkward period where we had to play nice with being called anti-american pushover snowflake pieces of shit though and I had a lot of self-loathing during that time.

            "comment": "Imagine being Donald Trump.\n\nYou inherited a fortune from your nasty Daddy, who was always mean to you and called you useless, stupid and incompetent, but you\u2019re out of your depth, don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and within a few years you\u2019re bankrupt again. You make a mental note to find out what incompetent means but you were only allowed to have Twitter and Pornhub installed and searching for incompetent on there brings back some really weird results. \n\nThen a bunch of Russian mobsters offer to bank roll you as long as you help them get their money out of Russia and into US dollars. The money is rolling in and then you find out that you\u2019re being investigated by the FBI.\n\nYou start to realize you\u2019re totally fucked and then someone says to you jokingly, \u201cwell if you were president of the United States they can\u2019t touch you. Lol\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s a good idea you think and the Russians seem to like the idea and since they still have the only copy of that P tape they bought of Ghislane Maxwell... shudder. Then unbelievably, you actually win and become the 45th President of the United States. But you\u2019re still a clueless idiot.\n\nEveryone around you realizes this and they come to the decision that the best course of action is to keep out of the way of the adults, and playing golf as often as possible. To make your feel like you have something important to do, where they think you can\u2019t get into trouble, they let you use the Twitter account, because hey, it\u2019s 140 characters. How much trouble can he get himself into?\n\nThen it snowballs. You keep posting any old crazy shit. You literally say what you want and the crazier you write, the more likes it gets. It becomes additive. Let\u2019s go crazier. More likes. This Twitter shit is better than golf. Ooh, and everyone that is nasty to you you fire. It\u2019s just like The Apprentice. Great show. Fantastic show. You were great. Like a dog. Ferocious.\n\nThen some white cop kills a black man and it incites protests across the country and black voters register in record numbers. Corona virus hits like a perfect storm and your narcissistic pride won\u2019t let you wear a mask or take precautions and your huge echo chamber makes you feel like it\u2019s best to pretend covid-19 is a hoax. You realize to late you\u2019ve fucked up and you can\u2019t hold back the wave of dissent rolling across the country, just as the election looms. You need your second term. That FBI file is still waiting for you.\n\nYou lose the election. It\u2019s close. You start getting desperate. You call in favors. You go all out offensive which just leads to embarrassing phone calls being taped and released. Your own party starts to desert you like rats leaving the sinking ship. Your own VP hates you and everything you now stand for.\n\nThat Twitter echo chamber has convinced you that there is an army of militia men armed to the teeth and willing to make sure you get your second term. Nothing to lose now. Except most of the people that turn up aren\u2019t armed militia. They are just sheep. Your sheep, and they have no one to actually lead them. Your planned coup fails. A tinpot backwater Central American country can organize a better coup than yours. Pity you didn\u2019t have the CIA helping you. They have a wealth of experience in organizing coups.\n\nBefore you know it you\u2019ve incited sedition, nearly caused a coup d\u2019etat and you\u2019re facing your second impeachment.\n\nAnd you\u2019re a one term president and that hurts because it seems that nobody really likes you any more, even old faithful Fox News. At least Alex Jones will lick your flabby orange chocolate starfish.\n\nAnd you\u2019re facing more FBI issues than you started with when you tried to avoid the initial problem in the first place. And you\u2019re bankrupt and the people you owe money to have a tendency to serve polonium tea. What a wild ride.\n\nNow you\u2019re going to be impeached. Twice. You\u2019re great. No other president has ever managed that. Winner winner chicken dinner. \n\nAnd they\u2019ve kicked you off Twitter. You start to feel the urge to tweet. You need that dopamine hit, but every time you pick up your gold plated iPhone you are reminded that that rich asshole Dorsey kicked you off Twitter and he has a bigger Gulfstream jet than you. Dickhead. You start to twitch and tremble. You\u2019re having a breakdown. \n\nYou start to plan a new party. A great party. You\u2019ll call it Trumplicans. Those Republicans are dead. You\u2019ll show them. What a legacy you\u2019ll have. You don\u2019t need the money from those corporations. Your Trumplicunts will fund you with their stimulus checks. Those dumbwits haven\u2019t even realized you\u2019ve managed to pull of the most expensive socialist public tax-funded program ever in the history of the United States. \n\nYou hate the world. Where\u2019s that nuclear football again? Do I turn the key to the left or the right? I wasn\u2019t listening when they went over that bit because I was thinking about something angry to fit into 140 characters. Damn it. Now where\u2019s your daughter? You need a cuddle.\n\nEdit. Thanks for the awards and the upvotes folks. I had a lot of fun writing this.\n\nA moment of seriousness to end this all. \n\n&gt; To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. \n\nTheodore Roosevelt",

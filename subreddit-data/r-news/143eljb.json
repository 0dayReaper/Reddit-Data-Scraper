The article says this: \n\n&gt;While death records are not categorised by occupation or place of work, it is likely many workers who have died were employed on these World Cup infrastructure projects, says Nick McGeehan, a director at FairSquare Projects, an advocacy group specialising in labour rights in the Gulf. \u201cA very significant proportion of the migrant workers who have died since 2011 were only in the country because Qatar won the right to host the World Cup,\u201d he said\n\nWe do not know how many died building the stadiums. Is it a significant proprtion of the total? Maybe, but even the CEO quoted doesnt say that a significant proportion were working on stadiums, simply that they were only in the country because Qatar won the right.\n\nFor some context the UK has about 30 construction death a year. \n\nI'm not a massive fan of the middle east monarchies, but I do not think this is good reporting.",

So why give up now? It's hard, sure, but by doing nothing we're only making it worse. Here's something you can do: push for the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/get-loud-take-action/energy-innovation-act/). It's high time for its re-introduction. This is a crucial step for our planet's health. So, let's dive in, folks. Let's make a difference while we still can!",

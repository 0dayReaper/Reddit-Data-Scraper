My money is on that he goes radio silent until after midnight when he goes on another late night, adderall fueled twitter rampage.\n\nEdit: yo, \"every 5 minutes\" was hyperbole meant to be shorthand sarcasm, not literal. \n\nBut on a more serious note, to those wondering why I would care. He's still the President right now, and he is *constantly* attacking democracy, threatening to dismantle parts of the government, and still causing as much damage as he can. In addition, his supporters are rioting and attacking people across the country and there is a runoff election beginning that can influence control of the senate. This isn't \"finished\" in the sense that it means people can stop paying attention, responding with action, and speaking up where appropriate. (just don't literally refresh every 5 minutes over something and make sure to do things mentally or physically to stay healthy).",

This was more than a decade ago. At the time I was a student, a constituent, and I worked for the university.\n\nI set up his mic and everything. He was very pleasant before the meeting. Smiley and as smarmy as you might expect.\n\nSo things are going fine with his town hall, and I told my boss that I was going to ask a question.\n\nI explained what it was like to be a student paying tuition that seemed to be skyrocketing, and I asked him what he felt could be done to address this before it became even more of a problem. (\"I'm working a full time job and it doesn't touch all of my expenses... Etc\")\n\nHe gave me a sour face then told a story about how when he was in law school he worked the whole summer to pay for his tuition!\n\nHis assistant returned the mic and he gave me the stink eye one last time before he left.\n\nDude's a shit bird. I got similarly patronizing responses when I mailed him and Jeff sessions about net neutrality.\n\nEdit 2: now that I'm thinking about it, it could have been less than a decade.

Really looking forward to that one. \n\nLove how Trump scammed all these dummies out of $200,000,000+ and only spent $8 mil on Election fraud. Got all these losers thinking an affidavit from a trump supporter claiming the Election was unfair and blurry video of people doing non illegal things was somehow Election fraud. Trump literally convinced these idiots millions of dead people voted and that people were voting multiple times on mail in ballots. I mean you can't expect more from republicans but still. Either way, one biden is president I'm just going to ignore all the trump supporters. I'm sure they'll be doing the same old \"right wing terrorism\" thing they've been doing and making America worse but at least I won't see their stupid views trending online anymore.",

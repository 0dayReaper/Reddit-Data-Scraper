I guess I have to thank my parents that the extremism and bigotry ultimately pushed me away from that rabbit hole, but wonder what might have been if they had sunk their hooks into me on a day I was feeling especially lonely, unwanted, and desperate for a community.\n\nI should do some research on how to do outreach and deprogramming for some of these kids. There are powerful cultural forces at play here (weaponizing sexually frustrated young men has been the foundation of almost every war of aggression, especially the holy ones) and we probably all need to pitch in if we want to work against that. A lot easier for a Steve Bannon type to leverage this for evil than it is for someone else to try and deescalate these communities for good.",

So when I looked for help as a male victim of sexual assault from a female attacker, the overwhelming amount of support I found online came from people and places with right wing leanings that I did not agree with in the slightest.  Of course, the devil's bargain that was tacitly made was that if I took their support that it would be hooked into an anti-feminist right wing narrative that \"incels\" gobble up, so I never fully took it and refused interviews with right wing media\n\nUnfortunately, the other side of the coin hasn't been nearly as forthcoming with support, and in fact there have been many instances where interactions go a long way to prove the right wing narrative that feminists are hostile to men.  The answer to incel culture has been frankly middling at best, and instead of people coming together to create a more equal and supportive world, people (especially online) are far more invested in the \"us vs. them\" mentality that encapsulates discourse on almost every subject these days.  This even creeps into the harassment I have faced by students after I filed formal complaints against my university and my attacker, as many of those students began to harass me because they believe that I am some kind of anti-feminist evil no good bad guy who \"made it all up\" or \"deserved it\" somehow.  So as it stands, anti-incel movements are largely self defeating and do as much to drive mentally ill and susceptible men towards such communities rather than helping them pull away.  I got lucky and found one of the few rape crisis centers that would talk to men at all (and there are some very institutional reasons why many do not that is beyond any individual control), found supportive people who believed me, listened to me, find community again and helped me keep fighting and get back on my feet, but that is not the case for the vast majority of men who are knocked down.\n\nThe reasons for this are multi-faceted and complex.  I don't have time to go into it in nearly as much detail as I would like, and frankly I could (and probably should) write a book about this and my experiences trying to find positive support, but my main point is to drive home that **there are very few positive communities for men, we don't do enough to de-stigmatize therapy and provide resources, and most of all we re-enforce toxic masculinity every time we turn men away from sharing their experiences in earnest, failing to listen, and pass the buck back to men for fighting against a rigged game we all play a part in**.",

That reeks of privilege.\n\nThe Toronto van attacker lived in a stable home in an affluent area with both parents holding high-paying white collar positions, and was even almost done with a college degree. \n\nIf the biggest \"problem\" in your life is your inability to get laid and you're able to spend every waking hour ranting about it on the internet, you're probably in a position of relative privilege, compared to people who actually struggle with paying bills among other adult responsibilities.",

That right in the hands of patriots is ~~the only thing protecting us from tyranny~~ a part of the long legal process which led to land slowly being transferred from the control of corporations with royal charters to what would eventually be the country of Canada!!\n\n***\n\nFrankly, I think that second amendment -- the fact that Canada gained land and self-determination from Britain due to a long, boring, mutually-agreed legislative process -- is *at least* as important to Canadian identity as the USA's second amendment is to American identity.",

Sun tried opening a television channel here but it failed. However TV isn't where these folk are getting radicalized. It's online media thats doing it which have no scrutiny regarding whose funding it. Shit like daily wire, and Prager U, and general Facebook misinformation that's fueling stuff here. When the freedumb blockade organizers were in court they unironically argued they have \"First amendment rights\" (that's how they phrased it) in a Canadian court. These people just parrot shit they read or hear without giving a bit of thought of what it means and whether or not it applies to them. \n\nIt's clear they consume way too much American based \"news\" media. None of their political beliefs derive from a pure Canadian context instead it's all based on memes from American political culture bleeding through the internet.",

And if the people slinging the insults are teens themselves, I can tell you right now they're more than likely to be virgins (and hypocrites). There are countless dumb insults being slung around online (think of all the N-words and \"your mom\" crap in literally every online multiplayer game) and yet that hasn't led to entire demographics going on vengeful murder sprees.\n\nFurthermore, there's a difference between laughing at someone simply for being a virgin, and laughing at someone for being a shitty person (that causes them to remain a virgin). Every person on this planet who has lost their virginity was a virgin at one point. Were they feeling attacked in the past?\n\nI'm a 30+ male virgin, never even been on a date before, and no one in the real world has questioned me about it. It has absolutely zero impact on my ability to make friends at school, at work, etc of any gender.\n\nBlaming the issue on \"virgin shaming\" sounds like such a cop-out.\n\nI would also encourage anyone feeling \"attacked\" to read this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/hb4l7u/comment/fv8vgwy](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/hb4l7u/comment/fv8vgwy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

I know the simple answer is to just ban communities that promote/encourage terrorism. But be honest, are laws that get passed to address this really going to get to the root of the problem, or will they be wielded as a blunt weapon to effectively silence any group that the current party in power doesn't like under the guise of terrorism? What happens if Trump (or someone worse) gets reelected and suddenly trans communities are \"promoting terrorism\" because by the Republican party's definition they are trying to sexually abuse minors? What if a law is implemented to ban all Islamic communities from U.S. hosted websites (which is a lot of them) for similar reasons? You may be American (I'm not) but realistically U.S. politics has a significant impact on the entire world, and I have very little faith in American politicians to not pass egregious laws that severely limit free speech in the name of protecting public interests.\n\nI think most rational people can agree that terrorism is bad, whether it's right-wing, left-wing, or anywhere else on the spectrum. The problem is just that you definitely move into very grey world when you start developing laws and tools that target communities based on shared beliefs and open up a lot of opportunities for bad faith actors to use those tools and laws to hurt people.",

If you go to a lot of women's spaces you find women there who complain that most spaces are for men so they had to make their own spaces, complain about having to police their tone, words, body language ect so that men's egos don't get hurt, bare more emotional burdens in MxF relationships, stories of rape and SA and express frustration with negative interactions with some of the gendered expectations with the men in their lives and all I hear on these threads is nobody ever cares about men's pain. Nobody deserves loneliness and a lot of male spaces get hikacked by hatted, but it\u2019s sooooo hard to empathize with incels, and it gets old hearing nobody tries to help men. I've tried a lot in my past and tbh men need to hear from men.",

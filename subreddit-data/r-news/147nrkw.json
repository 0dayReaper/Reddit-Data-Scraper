Wouldn't knowingly continuing to do business(as a bank) with someone who is engaging in criminal activities be a crime in itself?\n\nI'm not really trying to start a huge debate but I have beliefs that when you're rich you can get away with crimes. That's a LOT of money and basically says \"yea we did it\" without legally saying they did it. If I hide fidel Castro's drug money in my closet ill probably be going to jail. Do not get sued, do not keep details private, straight to jail.\n\nSo all im saying is if they knowingly illegally helped epstein keep his illegal money flowing, then someone should be in jail. Having $200,000,000 dollars to pay out to temper everyone's anger is a luxury we can't all afford.\n\nIf im wrong about the specifics of this case then just ignore this. Im speaking generally and it does seem to me that there is some criminal activity somewhere in between the $200,000,000 that won't see the light of day because the victims are on their way to the bank. Hopefully at least they bank somewhere other than chase",

However the bank did not know exactly what he was doing (in so far as we know) or know for *sure* that he was doing anything illegal at all. They just knew that his pattern of financial activity was suspicious and if they had ended things right then when enough red flags were raised that would probably have been the end of it. \n\nBut he was a very big client with a very big account that brought them lots of money so they dragged their feet on closing it, and to some extent that is a judgement call. The law, AS FAR AS I KNOW I AM NOT A LAWYER, lays out certain guidelines and requires banks to have some certain monitoring and reporting standards to spot likely illegal activity and imposes some liability on them for facilitating it in instances where the bank really *should* have been suspicious and turned them away. But it doesn't spell out *exactly* what the line is or when it would be deemed to have been crossed. \n\nThis is because banking is wildly complex and there are so many scenarios and so many people banking. A bar tender at a Vegas hotel with 10k cash at the end of the night at randomish intervals could be a drug dealer or totally legit, it'd be an exercise in futility to try to come up with completely hard and fast rules. So the law says banks have to do due diligence and use good judgement but leaves a fair bit to their discretion. \n\nThe feds aren't completely stupid though so the banks are liable if they get it wrong beyond what they reasonably should have, of course determining what is reasonable is a headache. The penalty in all but the most egregious cases is still only financial though and still just falls on the bank.\n\nAs to why this is, it is because the government does not actually want banks to be *too* cautious. They want capital to flow fairly easily and people to use banks and trust them and be able to get money quickly without an overly high barrier, so they don't make bankers criminally liable for the actions of clients except in extreme cases and they limit penalties. They don't *want* bankers to be afraid to lend to or do business with anyone who isn't completely squeaky clean and they would be if there were more criminal penalties for client activity. It's an economic policy choice.",

Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s properties in France were and are *still* shrouded in secrecy and by some accounts was arranging for young girls to be brought to his prison visiting area when he was on \u201csuicide watch\u201d \u2014 in all likelihood one of those pimp-coordinators bringing them over was also a trained hitman (or hitwoman) and might\u2019ve offed Epstein to prevent any sort of unexpected leak of \u201cdirt\u201d gathered over many decades if and when he decided to talk\u2014he was the type of guy that would definitely talk if he could fan-dangle some sort of deal where he had protection and possibly given a false identity like those that rat out major players in the mafia, mobs, organized criminal networks et al. \n\nAnother thing that keeps getting buried is why this settlement in the US even happened \u2014 Deutsche Bank loaned millions to Jeffrey Epstein and billions to Donald J. Trump:\n\n\n&gt;The settlement announcement comes one month after [Deutsche Bank](https://www.pymnts.com/legal/2022/deutsche-bank-headquarters-raided-by-german-authorities-in-money-laundering-probe/), where Epstein became a client after he was forced out by JPMorgan in 2013, settled with Epstein victims for $75 million. JPMorgan\u2019s litigation with the U.S. Virgin Islands is ongoing.\n\n&gt;Monday\u2019s settlement stems from claims filed last year by an unnamed woman, using the pseudonym Jane Doe, that the bank knowingly benefited from and facilitated Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking operation. The woman, who alleges she was raped and trafficked, sued on behalf of a \u201clarge number\u201d of other victims of that operation.\n\nDirect link to the linked article in the OP: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/jeffrey-epstein-lawsuit-deutsche-bank-will-pay-75-million-to-victims.html\n\nThe following links a lot of this together and one can see a pattern start to emerge from the ether:\n\n&gt;DBTCA loaned Donald Trump a significant portion of the $2.5 billion total lent to him by Deutsche Bank. The breach report provided by Broeksmit is a inside look into DBTCA\u2019s complete financials around the time DBTCA issued several of its largest loans to Trump. In 2012, DBTCA approved a $125 million loan to purchase the Trump Doral Resort in Florida. Also in 2012, Trump took out an additional loan on his Chicago property, and in 2015, yet another DBTCA loan, this one worth $170 million, allowed Trump to purchase a 60-year lease to the Old Post Office Building in Washington, D.C.\n\n&gt;The subsidiary also had a relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the pedophile and sex trafficker who died under suspicious circumstances after his arrest in July, 2019. That relationship began in 2013, the same year Broeksmit was presented with the DBTCA breach report which documented massive liabilities to Russia.\n\n&gt;Gazprombank publicly admits that DBTCA is their correspondent bank in America, though the full nature of the relationship between the two banks remains murky. Based on the breach report and the correspondent banking network, it appears that DBTCA was the bank of choice for the Russian government bank for both cash management and correspondent banking.\n\nSource: [Russian Government Bank Deposited $500 Million into Deutsche Bank Subsidiary as it Lent to Trump](https://forensicnews.net/russian-government-bank-deposited-500-million-into-deutsche-bank-subsidiary-as-it-lent-to-trump/) ([Forensic News](https://forensicnews.net/), January 2020)\n\nPretty confident that the Jane Doe referred to in the OP linked article is also the one that is named in the [legal documents filed ~~filed~~ in the suit](https://www.scribd.com/document/463829562/Trump-Epstein-Pedophilia-Suit) that named both Jeffrey Epstein and Donald J. Trump as well (Case 1:16-cv-04642; Filed 06/20/16 in the US District Court, Southern District of New York).",

They legit passed business deals and everything else because at the time the law was correct the t\u2019s and i\u2019s were crossed and dotted. Business dealings don\u2019t usually have a face. It\u2019s an employee following protocol for something the person who holds the account wants. I would assume with his account they would have maybe three people who also have other clients they oversee. Are they now suppose to scrutinize every request for a loan for a private plane when your client has $$$$$$? The answer is no. It is a sure fire way to recoup your costs if a loss should occur and is just smart business. What Epstein did with said plane is by no means the fault of the company. I highly don\u2019t they suspected a man of his presentation to be a hideous beast.",

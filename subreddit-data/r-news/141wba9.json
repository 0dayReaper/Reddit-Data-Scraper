Before then we basically only had public schools. Now every other school is a joke, skimming profits of public funds and more often than not inflating grades so parents pick them. And yes, we also have schools run by extremists of different religions. It works just as bad as you think it can. Dont do it. Schools and healthcare should be nationalized across the world and not run for-profit.",

That inevitably set up inequalities for people receiving similar state funded assistance.",

It wasn\u2019t all abuse and horror, although I\u2019m 100% certain it was for some in some areas.     For me and my non religious friends it was like politely sitting through a time share presentation to get free show tickets that we couldn\u2019t otherwise afford. \n\nSomewhere along the line, the government started subsidizing, then fully funding these institutions and programs.  \n\nThat\u2019s when religion should not be a part of the services anymore.  But there isn\u2019t some hard cutover.  There isn\u2019t / wasn\u2019t always an agnostic option ready to step up and do the same work.   \n\nSo now big churches are collecting money from the government as a sub contractor for services like education and healthcare, they are also still taking money from members that used to fund those programs locally and they avoiding taxes while purchasing and stockpiling community assets like property and investment funds.  Greedy.   Some churches are still doing good, but what looks like a generous effort is actually a pretty weak one relative to what they are drawing in.\n\nWhen churches are drawing in millions of dollars in tithing and donations and investments and not rolling that directly back into their immediate community they are no longer not for profit or charitable organizations and should be paying taxes.",

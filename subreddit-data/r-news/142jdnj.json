This is actually not as bad as what Binance got hit with.\n\nIt's rather specific:\n\n&gt;In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.\n\n&gt;The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.\n\nMeaning the biggest ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum are not at issue.\n\n&gt;In the staking rewards program, which has about 3.5 million customers, Coinbase pools crypto assets and uses them to support activity on the blockchain network, in exchange for \"rewards\" it provides customers after taking a commission for itself.\n\nThey were also benefitting from staking and taking commissions from that, which were also unregistered assets.",

The SEC has already decided it they fail the Howey Test because there's no reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\n\nWhere is your evidence this is the SEC's official stance?\n\n&gt;If the SEC is ramping up its regulation and enforcement actions on crypto exchanges, they absolutely would include the two biggest cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities if they could.\n\nThe SEC goes where there is the most obvious wrongdoing being reported by specific victims.\n\nThey're not going to \"prosecute\" bitcoin or eth.  That's not how it works, but they will go after this case-by-case.  \n\nThe thing is, what makes bitcoin or eth a security isn't \"their nature.\"  It's the operators that promote them.  And very rarely are the risks of \"investing\" in btc or eth made clear.  (That's securities fraud right there - but it is enforced on a case-by-case basis).\n\nEDIT: /u/ScipioAfricanvs blocked me so I couldn't reply so I'll reply here:\n\n&gt; You\u2019re quite off base with how the SEC decides enforcement actions - and I say this as a securities lawyer. If the chair(s) have publicly said for years they don\u2019t believe bitcoin is a security, there\u2019s essentially a 0% chance there will ever be an action taken against exchanges who deal with bitcoin.\n\nBut there's already been action.  Coinbase and Binance deal with Bitcoin.  So you are clearly wrong.\n\nIt's important here to note that \"bitcoin\" itself is just a technology.  So we need to differentiate between \"taking action against bitcoin\" and \"taking action against selling an unregistered security.\"\n\nIf you're a lawyer, you should understand that distinction.  I'm talking about the latter, not the former - so don't conflate the two.\n\nBitcoin itself, is a technology.  What makes it a security isn't its inherent design, *but how it is markets and promoted and sold to people*.   And in many cases, when you look at the context in which BTC is marketed by many people, including exchanges, it does pass the Howey Test.\n\nThe only way you can skirt around this is by conflating the technology with the operation of selling/promoting the tokens.\n\nFor example, postal coupons are not \"securities\", but Charles Ponzi's **operation** that used them as an investment vehicle made them into \"securities\", as part of an illegal, fraudulent scheme.\n\nPlease recognize the distinction.",

These companies are not 100% necessary, but people use them for convenience and often end up leaving their funds with them, which are ripe for abuse.",

Accounts are just numbers with no details attached, but with enough specialist investigative effort you can generally trace the history through to an exchange or known wallet and make some assumptions from there. Still that's not easy for most people to trace.\n\n&gt; and transaction validation gets increasingly more expensive as time marches on\n\nI don't believe that's accurate. The POW difficulty for new block production self adjusts to keep a near constant rate of production, and this is a function of existing hashpower in the mining pool, not based on the number of transactions before it. Block validation itself is a fairly simple task and makes use of a hash of previous block plus the current set of transactions,  which is easy to verify and shouldn't increase with the number of blocks before it.",

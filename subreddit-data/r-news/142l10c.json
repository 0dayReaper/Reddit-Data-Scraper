There has been a reality with climate and ecosystem science -- we continue to learn we know *nothing* about our planet.\n\nEvery 2-3 years we seem to find some new facet to our global ecosystem that we learn plays a huge role in regulating greenhouse gases or weather in general. Then climate scientists have to factor this new finding in and it shrinks the window more and more on \"Time Till We Are *Really* Fucked.\"\n\nJust some things that come to mind: the realization of how important tropic rain forests are, impact of permafrost melt, impact of changing ocean salinity levels, impacts of CO2 on ocean acidity, impacts of ocean temperatures, polar ice impacts on heating, impacts of polar/glacial melts on the speed of melting. And the list goes on.\n\nSome of these discoveries only nudge the estimates a little, others a lot, but its cumulative (and in some cases maybe multiplicative).",

So climate change doesn't really matter, and all good believers are gonna get raptured anyway.  So there's no point in trying to do anything about it, and anyone who wants to do so obviously has some nefarious ulterior motive.\n\nPeople actually believe this.

It is fine to still produce shit (from an emissions standpoint) as long as the energy being used to produce it is not adding CO2 from outside the system like currently is being done with fossil fuels. It would not take a rebuilding of society to accomplish this. We could fairly easily move to renewable and nuclear for energy. We can also switch over to electric vehicles without killing growth. You know how we know? Other countries are already doing it. And these are not small, rich countries either. Even countries that we consider to be large oil producers like Russia, Mexico, and Brazil get more of their energy from renewables than the US does. Renewables, even factoring in energy storage, typically cost less than using fossil fuels. The US is near the bottom in the OECD when it comes to renewable energy. It is a similar story with EVs.\n\nWill switching to both of those completely fix the problem? Nope. Like you said, even if we stopped emitting now, it would take decades for the CO2 to decrease enough to not be disastrous. We would still have to take more CO2 out of the system. That means reforestation and carbon capture to help speed up the recovery process.\n\nJust saying \"stop consuming\" is not very helpful since people are not going to voluntarily do that. With the right legislation, we can minimize the pain. And again, we can do it while not having to decrease energy use as long as we switch to something that is not emitting billions of tons of CO2.",

If we need more carbon-free power, we need to build more power generation. Even if the decision is made to avoid nuclear power, we can build solar, wind, tidal, hydro, geothermal, etc. etc. etc. That power generation doesn't exist already because no one wants to pay for it.  And from one perspective that's logical, because that's going to be spending money that won't see a positive rate of return.  But from another perspective, the world is going to burn if we don't collectively step up, so it's absolutely positive rate of return over the long term.",

Current projections show a single BOE cascading  to many more, with a longer duration, causing massive disruption to the Jet Stream.\n\n*Once BOEs persist for many months and the Arctic warms up considerably, the jet stream will lose its energy due to a lessening of the temperature difference between the Arctic region and the tropical region. At that point, storms that form in the mid-latitudes will be stuck in place or drift very slowly, having little or no jet stream steering currents to move them along. This will cause them to drop excessive rainfall on areas in which they occur, causing so much rain that crops cannot be sustained.*\n\n*In other places, long-lasting heat waves and droughts will occur since the lack of jet stream steering currents will keep rain-free heat domes in place. This would obviously be devastating for humans that rely upon steady sources of food and water since crops cannot grow during extended heat waves and droughts. Essentially, a catastrophic reoccurring BOE in the Arctic Ocean would end life as we know it. Human civilization has been built on the ability to grow crops reliably and get them to people who live away from farms for sustenance and survival.*\n\nhttps://soapboxie.com/social-issues/What-Is-a-Blue-Ocean-Event-and-How-Will-It-Impact-Global-Climate",

Well they\u2019re correct. \n\nBut how?  Why does the climate change?  \n\nIt\u2019s not magic. \n\nThe climate changes because the Earth\u2019s orbit varies - it isn\u2019t a perfect oval. No planet\u2019s orbit is perfect. \n\nThe tiny bit of change in our orbit means we get slightly more warmth from the sun during one phase and slightly less during the other. Just a tiny amount. \n\nThe variation in orbit is called the Milankovitch Cycle. \n\nDoes having a little more or less sun cause ice ages and warm spells?  Not on its own.\n\nBut when the Earth\u2019s atmosphere warms just a smidge, the oceans warm up. And as they warm they release carbon dioxide.  When they cool down, they absorb carbon dioxide. \n\nIt\u2019s just the nature of gases - they\u2019re absorbed into cool water and released when water warms up. Think about a pot of boiling water releasing bubbles.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) traps heat. So as the CO2 level in the air rises, the atmospheric temperature increases.  Which causes more CO2 to be released by the oceans.  Which raises the temperature some more. \n\nIt\u2019s a positive feedback loop.  \n\nWhen our orbit is in the cooler phase the temperature falls and the CO2 level slowly goes back down.  Cooling off takes longer than warming up. \n\nDuring ice ages, the CO2 level was 180 parts per million (ppm) and during warm spells, the CO2 has been 280 ppm.\nIt\u2019s been a  consistent system for 800,000 years. Heats up, cools very slowly. 180-280 ppm, back and forth. \n\nThe problem is\u2026for 150 years we\u2019ve been digging up fossil fuels and burning them, adding CO2 to the atmosphere. Gigatons of CO2. Every year. \n\nSo the CO2 level in the atmosphere is now over 400ppm.  Change is happening. And it\u2019s causing more changes. \n\nAs the permafrost in Siberia thaws, gigatons of methane gas are being released. Methane traps 30 times more heat than CO2. \n\nOnce-frozen Siberia has been burning, which releases more CO2. \n\nMelting glaciers and lack of snow accumulation mean the Earth loses reflectivity and absorbs more heat. Which causes more melting. \n\n\n(Preaching to the choir, here, but if you know someone who\u2019s educable, feel free to share)",

I threw up a little bit in my mouth.  The stuff of nightmares.\n\nEDIT: Repeating my exercise, I get that the accumulated energy represented by that 1 degree C in the top 100 meters of ocean is about 42,000,000 tera-Watt-hours (TWh).  That's accumulated over about 200 years of industrialization, and the greenhouse effect resulting from burning fossil fuels.\n\nA big hurricane might release 100 TWh over its lifetime.",

But the list of headlines they provided is indisputable.  The point I was trying to make by posting this list is - predictions have often been incorrect.  And headlines like the one OP provided, along with the accompanying article, do not provide a balanced perspective to climate change.  I do not deny that climate is changing.  But according to historical estimates, sea levels have been hundreds of meters higher than they are now - without human intervention.  In my view, we're lucky to be alive during a time when we can enjoy places like the Florida Keys and Hawaii.  But with or without human intervention, humans should be planning to move away from those locations at some point anyway.  Could be 30 years.  Could be 3,000 years (or more).  But near-global flooding will likely happen again if history is a guide.",

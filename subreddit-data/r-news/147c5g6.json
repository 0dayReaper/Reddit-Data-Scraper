That's why I have a job. \n\nSounds like the tagline for a show I'd want to watch.\n\nEDIT: I was thinking more along the lines of a show about someone who cleans the mess after the killings. ChatGPT helped me cook this up:\n\nIn the gritty world of Dublin's criminal underbelly, Colin Farrell takes the lead as Liam Doyle, a skilled cleaner for an Irish crime syndicate. When Liam stumbles upon a sinister plot that puts his life at risk, he must race against time to protect himself and unravel the truth before it's too late.\n\nAs Liam dives deeper into the shadows, he uncovers a web of deceit and corruption, where loyalty is tested and betrayals lurk around every corner. With each step he takes, the line between good and evil blurs, pushing him to the edge of his abilities and forcing him to confront his own demons.\n\nBrendan Gleeson co-stars as Sean O'Malley, Liam's conflicted mentor. Sean's unwavering loyalty to the syndicate is tested as he grapples with his concern for Liam's safety. Together, they navigate the treacherous terrain of Dublin's crime world, facing off against formidable foes and uncovering shocking revelations along the way.\n\nIn this action-packed suspense drama, Liam Doyle must rely on his instincts, resourcefulness, and the adrenaline rush of survival to stay one step ahead of those who seek to bring him down. With the stakes higher than ever, Liam's fight for redemption and justice will take him to the darkest corners of Dublin's underworld, where he must confront the truth, confront his own past, and confront the ruthless forces determined to bring him to his knees.",

The use of a grill does not automatically make something a barbecue. \n\nIt does barbecue a disservice to equate it to grilling. Grilling usually just gives you the char flavor, which can be overwhelming and kind-of one-note. Barbecue takes time, and involves a much more through and complex infusion of flavor from the marinade/basting sauces and the smokiness of a low and extended cook time.",

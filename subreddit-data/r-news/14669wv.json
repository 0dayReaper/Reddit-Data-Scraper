I post this a lot but I think it's very valuable for people to see how far back it goes, how long it's been growing, and how deeply rooted it is in modern culture:\n\n&gt; \u201cTo see the Hell\u2019s Angels as caretakers of the old \u2018individualist\u2019 tradition \u2018that made this country great\u2019 is only a painless way to get around seeing them for what they really are,\u201d Thompson writes in that book, calling them \u201cthe first wave of a future that nothing in our history has prepared us to cope with. The Angels are prototypes. Their lack of education has not only rendered them completely useless in a highly technical economy, but it has also given them the leisure to cultivate a powerful resentment\u2026 and to translate it into a destructive cult which the mass media insists on portraying as a sort of isolated oddity\u201d destined for extinction.",

He turned a car head first into a wall at 170+mph last year (A fan favorite driver, at that, also the driver notorious for dropping the N word). And he drives a Toyota (which is a taboo in the sport because it's not a \"Murica car.\")\n\nBut yeah, a large amount of the boos are because he is black, which is sad. There is a better example of this inherent racism with a driver by the name of Rajah Caruth in the Truck Series that is a virtual  nobody currently. No on the track issues. Super nice kid, but yeah tons of boos cause, you guessed it, he's black.",

Even though in both cases it's people boycotting because they don't like what a company did, they've convinced themselves that they are different and better. They can't name a single company that Liberals have forced out of business though.\n\nIt's also ridiculous because Right-wingers \"cancel\" people/companies for being inclusive or supporting civil rights, while people on the Left \"cancel\" people/companies when they spread hatred and ignorance. Right-wingers think the people spreading hatred and ignorance are the good guys, while the people supporting inclusion and fighting against things like police brutality are the bad guys.",

She literally said Hitler was right about something and then directly quoted Hitler. It doesn\u2019t matter that the direct quote isn\u2019t specifically anti Semitic. Quoting Hitler after saying \u201cHitler was right\u201d is vile. Period. It\u2019s not like a terribly original sentiment that you\u2019d have to look to Hitler for. There\u2019s a reason to quote Hitler and it isn\u2019t because he\u2019s the visionary who figured out that the children are the future.\n\nSecond edit: wow people are still arguing with me that it\u2019s okay to say Hitler was right. How about \u201cwhoever has the children has the future\u201d IS a creepy evil quote. It expresses ownership and manipulation rather than care and concern. Wasn\u2019t she criticizing her belief that leftists are manipulating youth through public education? So that WAS the context. Hitler\u2019s solution was the Hitler youth. The quote IN context speaks to nefarious aims and beliefs.\n\nPeople defending this BS I see you. You\u2019re not concerned about misrepresentation of context. This isn\u2019t even a dog whistle anymore it\u2019s a cattle call.",

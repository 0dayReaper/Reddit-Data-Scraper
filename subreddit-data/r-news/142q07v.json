Was at the counter when suddenly one clerk said to another \"there's the car!\" He motions to a car pulling up to the building and parking. In one swoop he yanks down the bullet proof partition and latches it. I'm on the other side like \"WTF let me in!\" He apologizes that he can't let me in too. I haul ass out the door to my car and watch as an elderly lady gets out of the car they were scared of. Fuck those guys. It's been 20 years but still, fuck those guys.",

His actions, directly put these people in danger. That\u2019s at the very least sufficient to CHARGE someone of manslaughter. The same way locking people in a building that ends up brining down after or during the locking up took place, would be considered manslaughter. \n\nIt\u2019ll be up to them to defend themselves and be found guilty or not. \n\nAll that aside, that\u2019s different than the implication you are making. Talking about the police and their duty to protect, versus people shitting on this clerk and his duty to protect. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a duty to protect anyone, but people weren\u2019t asking him to do that, unlocking the door isn\u2019t protecting anyone, it\u2019s just also NOT hindering them from protecting themselves.",

It\u2019s that he knowingly trapped bystanders in his store with someone he knew was a violent, irrational robber; just to keep the robber from running off with a few random items.\n\nNo one\u2019s saying it was his job to protect them, but it also wasn\u2019t his job to trap them in harm\u2019s way. Despite the threats in advance to shoot the three customers he\u2019d trapped in with the robber, he didn\u2019t unlock the door until said robber had gotten around to shooting the last person. Now two people have been hospitalized with the third person dead.\n\nNot saying that makes the clerk guilty of actual murder, or that fear didn\u2019t understandably effect his logic process, if it did. It\u2019s the shooter being charged with murder and attempted murder; the clerk is facing possible charges of involuntary manslaughter, meaning that while he didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm, his actions may have contributed to the death of another person.\n\nI feel sorry for that clerk and the customers; they had a very shitty day that probably felt like it all unraveled too quickly.",

They know some people charged with murder turn out to be innocent, but they're willing to sacrifice the lives of those innocent people to punish the guilty.\n\nWelfare is another example. They're willing to allow children to starve because they don't want those who don't actually deserve welfare to recieve their ill gotten gains.\n\nAnd so these people died because in their head that was a small price to pay to keep an armed robber from getting away with less than $4 worth of merchandise.",

The clerk was supposed to read the killer's mind to know he would kill, unlike the string of crazies that a late-night gas station gets regularly. I assume the clerk gets death threats ten times a night which is why he is in a glassed-off safe room.",

Sealing innocent bystanders in with someone you can reasonably conclude will cause them bodily harm is more along the lines of involuntary manslaughter, possibly negligent homicide, or even accessory to murder if you have a hellbent DA. Goading the killer typically makes your case even worse for you.",

When it comes to manslaughter, the circumstances and the outcome matter quite a bit. It's legal to lightly shove your friend's shoulder while joking around. It's not legal to shove your friend while they're standing next to a cliff. \n\nUsually, involuntary manslaughter is defined as recklessly engaging in behavior that a reasonable person would've realized would lead to death or serious bodily harm. Most reasonable people would've known it's not safe to continue taunting a man who's already threatened to shoot the hostages.",

Because locking people in isn\u2019t a threat to others, it\u2019s not like there was poison gas in the store. But not opening the door and letting them all go after the psychopath threatened to shoot people definitely fits reckless disregard for human life and potentially the third.  I still kind of have problems with blaming the person who didn\u2019t pull the trigger on people, but for $3.80? Come on man.  At very least I hope the victims are able to get financial compensation in civil court against whatever asshole made the policy that the employee was following.",

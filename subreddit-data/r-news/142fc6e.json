The medical industry in this country is a sham and is indeed extortion, thanks in large part to corps like you. Cutting into your massive profits to help the people you *claim* to care about isn\u2019t.",

I used to work in that field, and I can tell you the manufacturing cost is ~$100-200/gram while the retail price is ~$57,000/gram. Is there a lot of R&amp;D to pay off? Sure, but the first year or two's sales paid that off easily (and all the failures it took to get there).\n\nThe typical added survival is gonna vary wildly between diseases and patients, but expect +1.5 years for a PD1 inhibitor and a \"typical\" application for the low low price of ~$150,000 per year (which the government paid the foundational research for).\n\nMerck spends billions more on marketing than it does R&amp;D. Marketing that is illegal almost everywhere outside the US (I think New Zealand allows it?).",

In the US, it might cost $50 for that fill and the insurance company is on the hook for $950.\n\nWho profits? Pharma.\n\nSure there's terrible health plans, but if the US wants to easily clean up their problem, constrain Pharma like just about every other country does,  make it law that all healthcare needs to be non-profit, and stop allowing mega mergers acquisitions in Healthcare (and elsewhere too).

It's stupider than I thought. Merck claims its right to free speech will be violated because it will be forced to \"agree\" to what the government considers a \"fair\" price, and that this means Merck is being forced by the government to say the price is fair. But nothing in the lawsuit, as far as I see, suggests that Merck would be gagged from telling the public that it hates the deal and that it doesn't really like the price. In that case, just because Merck agrees to a price that the *government* defines as \"fair\" sure doesn't sound like *Merck* is being forced to say anything.\n\nBut I don't claim to be a First Amendment scholar.",

In the extremely corrupt country it was the opposite: private distributors got ridiculously low prices (while selling to the end user at the same price as the other country) and the public system bought at full price. \n\nGotta add that in both countries the product prices were much, much lower than in the US btw.",

Even if sold at ~$1000/gram as a low-cost product (less than the price in China) that's nearly $1 billion in profits every year. The entire project would be paid off in just 2 years of sales, including the clinical trials, loans, etc.\n\nJust about any cash-strapped state would be desperate to have a new plant like that and would happily cut the red tape re: zoning and licensing, as it would mean $100+ million/year in wages to 300+ employees.\n\nThe biggest pharma companies won't do this because it would eat into each other's (and their own) profits.",

Every buyer of everything has the right to negotiate the price.\n\nWhat they should be worried about is when Medicare is allowed to negotiate prices on ALL drugs.  We're only talking a handful now.\n\nIMHO the starting point for the negotiation should be the lowest price a given drug is sold for anywhere in the world.  Medicare should not pay a penny more than that.  It is not the function of the American public to subsidize drug prices overseas when we can barely afford the drugs here.",

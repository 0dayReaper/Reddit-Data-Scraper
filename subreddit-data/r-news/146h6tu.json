They're targeting kids and need to be stopped.\n\nSo denial, \"no true Scotsman\", minimizing and then victim blaming.  They simply will not accept that they are on the side of homophobia and people dangerous/insane enough to act out their depraved genocidal fantasies.  They pretend like these extremists don't exist in their camp, which allows them to go about feeling good and righteous about their cause without a care in the world about what it will ultimately lead to.\n\nThey are *enablers*.  Either willingly or negligently complicit. In the end, they're equally as bad as they have the same conclusions.  \n\nHow do we combat this? Shame doesn't work, they're immune.  Logic doesn't work, they're delusional.  Appealing for empathy doesn't work, they have none.  Jail doesn't work, it stokes their persecution complex and makes them more extreme.  What do we do?",

We don't want to live like that, but we appreciate you want to and we don't want to stop you....even though it's THIS, and all your weird differences in your factions that is responsible for most wars and most of the current atrocities we hear from around the world.

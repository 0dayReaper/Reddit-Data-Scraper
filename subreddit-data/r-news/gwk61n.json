That's what's stopping me. \n\nI LOVE seeing the protests all over the nation; all 50 states had some form of protest against police brutality and the injustice/racism the Black community faces. But I'm extremely worried that with all these mass gatherings, Covid-19 will make a resurgence. \n\nI debated whether going in person was worth risking my health, and the health of other protesters. The coronavirus killed more than 100,000 people in under 3 months. And its Black communities that are disproportionately affected by this public health crisis. Personally, I opted to stay home and support Black Lives Matter in other ways: donations, petitions, social media and discussions with my family and friends. \n\nOf course, if you do end up attending a protest in person, I WILL support your 1st amendment right. And I will drive by to honk for justice.",

Yet he is popular and took part just as others did. So he was an easily identified target. \n \nIt makes a headline showing consequences of rioting. People who don like Jake now side with police against him and other rioters. Especially because his name makes the news much more popular than some rando no one knows. Dude was used to make an example. Potentially scaring people from rioting knowing if they get caught they can be tracked down and charged. With mobs rioting its hard for police to deal and charge law breakers, but if you can id them and proove it you can charge them after the fact. There's a reason when you watch footage of antifa and other groups you hear people yelling not to record it and such, because it's video evidence against them.\n\nNot speaking to his character, if you just treat him as an average Joe who attends the protest you wouldn't necessarily be happy he's in legal trouble, but because people think negatively of him he's perfect to make an example of with more support than a rando and the media coverage to push an agenda.",

Logan has actually done the right thing for once regarding the protests and murder of George Floyd...and then there is Jake,  maybe not physically looting himself, but just by him being there with his cameras it is going to influence those around him to do things to try to impress him and his millions of children viewers watching. He can't control what those around him do, but in the videos I've seen he doesn't even try to stop it,  and then accepts a bottle of alcohol that's clearly just stolen from the PF Chang's moments earlier.",

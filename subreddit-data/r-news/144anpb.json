            "comment": "&gt;\tSome MPs criticised the proposal, saying it would open the path for same-sex partners to have children. However, Daniel\u0117 argued that two women living together currently have the opportunity to have children by using artificial insemination services abroad, and such families do exist.\n\nThis is why it failed. They don\u2019t want gay people having kids in their country. They don\u2019t care if they go somewhere else to do it, but they want to make it hard for them to have kids. That\u2019s how much they hate gay people: they will keep children from even being conceived.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that [children in a same sex household do as well as, or better, than a straight couple](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2023/03/06/kids-raised-by-same-sex-parents-fare-same-as-or-better-than-kids-of-straight-couples-research-finds/amp/) to them.",

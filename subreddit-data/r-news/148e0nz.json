It held up well for a while in state, but it was still a southern state seeing voters change from conservative Dems to republicans. Clinton is the only Dem to win in a presidential since Carter. He won in 92 and 96, but probably would have been extremely close in 92 if Ross Perot didn\u2019t run. Gore lost by 8% and Kerry lost by 14%. Mary Landrieu held the senate seat until 2015z\n\nKatrina definitely had a big impact though. New Orleans went from around 1M to roughly 700K population. Nola votes like 80% or more Dem so that was a massive loss in voters, though at the presidential level Dems have lost by around 300K-400K. The biggest impact imo, though, is that Louisiana would have been well poised to shift blue like VA/AZ/GA over the last decade had Katrina not decimated the population and scare people from moving there.",

And this is exactly what I'm complaining about when I say \"positive spin.\"\n\nThis is not a situation where someone finds a way to escape execution and live happily ever after. This is a person being told, explicitly, \"cut your dick off and live as a woman or we will kill you.\" In *no way* is that even a remotely positive, silver-lining, good-thing-in-a-bad situation scenario.

And it is. But it's reasonable to assume that experience is roughly analogous to the experience of trans people going though puberty in a direction they don't wish to; with some obvious provisos, but in terms of severity and harm, these things are similarly bad if they happen to a person.\n\nThe problem is that the rate of transition regret is less than that of knee surgery, and even less if people are allowed hormones pre puberty. So by the argument of pure harm reduction, we should be in theory offering transition to everyone who asks, just more and more people, and can carry on doing so aggressively until that rate of regret reaches 50%!\n\nObviously medically making an intervention is not the same as not making one, and there are other factors involved, but no rational person should really at this point be arguing for anything but a rapid emergency expansion of trans healthcare.\n\n...unless everyone's operating on one fucking horrible assumption; when a cis person, child, feels something bad, it's worse than if a trans person, child, feels something bad.",

Affirmative care is \u201can approach to health care delivery in which organizations, programs, and providers recognize, validate, and support the identity stated or expressed by the individuals served.\u201d So basically what you initially thought. \n\nFor prepubescent minors affirmative care mostly just means not denying their identity or attempting conversion therapy, instead using their preferred name/pronouns/etc. With pubescent minors it means helping them explore whether other non-medical or medical forms of transition (hormone blockers, hormone replacement therapy when they are older teens, maybe surgery once they are no longer minors) could be helpful for them specifically. This happens when the patient raises concerns about dysphoria with specific parts of their body or expresses interest in hormones and such. If a patient asks what options are out there for people who feel like them they might be provided a list of medications/procedures, but are made aware that these are just the possibilities and not a checklist that must be completed to be a \u201creal\u201d [insert gender]. \n\nConservatives often portray affirmative care as a doctor forcing procedures on the patient, where literally all it means is not fighting the patient over their identify and being a source of information when they ask questions about specific things or express specific discomforts/distress.",

And most are paid for, at least in part, by health insurance. Even Medicare and Medicaid pay for elective surgery.\n\n&gt;The catch is that most health plans will only pay for an elective surgery that\u2019s medically necessary, and your health insurer\u2019s opinion of what\u2019s medically necessary may differ from your surgeon\u2019s opinion.\n\nElective and medically necessary are different, it seems. I imagine you're confusing the two, which is understandable.\n\n&gt;Elective surgery is a surgical procedure you may choose (elect) to have or choose not to have. Some elective surgeries are medically necessary; some are not. But the defining characteristic of an elective procedure is that if you don't have it done, you will not immediately die or suffer grave consequences",

Literally the only reason Sisolak got elected was due to people knee jerk reacting and line voting \"D\" because of Trump. The state voted for Biden, and still rejected Sisolak, the only incumbent governor to lose re-election. \n\nThe state elected a republican governor following both years that it voted for Obama. The state doesn't adhere to Republican/Democrat preconceptions. Clark county / Las Vegas makes up most of the state and is full of gun loving, social progressives, financial conservatives and retirees.\n\nHonestly Trump is probably the worst thing to happen to the state in decades, because his abrasive personality, moronic haters and supporters drove a bunch of unqualified morons into office and fucked up local politics for a solid 4-6 years. There were moronic Democrats that got elected solely on their \"anti-trump\" agenda which had no bearing on local politics, and moronic Republicans who basically pushed out our normal moderate Republicans.

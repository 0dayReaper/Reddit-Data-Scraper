It was changed to encourage people to seek treatment as knowing you were at risk and it could be felony if you knew led to people not seeking diagnosis and treatment. It was also changed to make it easier to show intent due to sociopathic assholes like the person in the article - who we should note is not in California...\n\nFortunately treatments now are good enough to drive viral load to zero in people infected so it's no longer a death sentence (though given America's medical system I suppose insurance could drop people if pharma decides to spike the price). That's good news for the victims of this predator, but he absolutely deserves punishment for sexual assault and knowingly infecting his victims.",

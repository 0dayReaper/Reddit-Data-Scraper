To your point though the basic idea would be like if the roles of President and cabinet secretaries could only be chosen from people who are current members of Congress (and they'd have to stay in Congress while also serving doing their job in the administration).\n\nGovernments with that kind of arrangement can sometimes cause odd political situations too, occasionally countries will suddenly lose a Prime Minister with great public support simply because the PM happens to lose a small local election for their original seat in parliament. It would be like the U.S. President getting instantly kicked out of office because they happen to be from southern kansas and some people in Wichita happened to be in a bad mood that day.",

I do know for sure that the MP for your Borough being made the speaker of the house is the worst thing you could want as he remains the MP for your Borough but does not get the ability to represent your wants/needs. For example if the government puts forwards a plan for my Borough to have a new prison built here, no matter how much the residence hate the idea if their MP is the speaker he can not represent their thoughts and feelings. The speaker of the House is an important role as anyone that has seen the youtube videos on the way the house of commons debates.",

The party with the most MPs wins, and the leader of that party becomes PM. If the leader steps down, they stop being PM, but they carry on as an MP. This is what happened to Boris after one scandal too many.\n\nUntil yesterday, Boris was still an MP, but after the result of an enquiry into his behaviour as PM, he was facing sanctions that would have triggered a by-election in his constituency (an election in between general elections). There's a good chance he would have lost this by-election, so he has decided to get ahead of this by quitting as an MP so that he can try to control the narrative.",

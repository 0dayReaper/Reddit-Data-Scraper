He goes through each day in fear, trying to stay in his cell as much as possible, coming out only for showers and family phone calls,\u201d his lawyers said.\n\nOh no, how awful. Maybe now he feels an iota of what he did to others for decades. Get fucked, old man. However they\u2019re treating you in prison is better than you deserve.",

Many.   I have no sympathy whatsoever for him.  He used his position to prey on a whole parade of innocent patients.",

I know we\u2019ve seen that portrayed on the TV and Movies, but to endure it in real life is criminal. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02",

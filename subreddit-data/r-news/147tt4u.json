Moving here from Texas, where you can just access the beach for free and walk in any direction, as far as you like, it was jarring. \n\n**All beaches in this country should be public property. We were born in this country and we have a right to be able to enjoy it.**\n\nRich people trying to take beaches for themselves is something that really burns me.",

Cops can and historically have sided with the homeowner during trespass calls.  The only legally protected way is to boat in, swim/paddle over from another beach with access (usually not feasible), or fight them in court. \n\nSo there\u2019s essentially no consequence for the homeowner until either the government or a private organization (such as Surfrider, who won the case for Martin\u2019s beach) steps in and sues.  Homeowners can continue to prevent access, and law enforcement will support them if anyone actually tries to protest it. \n\nWhat would **REALLY** make a difference in the fight would be to legally protect non-destructive trespassing for beach access if it is intentionally blocked.  This allows access for all, and incentivizes homeowners to create a direct access path to avoid people trampling through their yard.",

It's possible to privately own tidelands and other areas extending far out into the saltwater, including the beach. The reason is the state wanted to lure transcontinental railroads at the time of statehood, and they thought that if the railroads could privately own waterfront property, they would be more likely to build ports and railroads across the state and bring prosperity. And that it would give businesses a competitive advantage over those in Oregon and California. But unfortunately it means that there is some private ownership of beaches and tidelands in the state as a result.",

So you have landowners trying to enforce private boundaries using things like buoys and floating fences. \n\nThat\u2019s before you get to the craziness of water rights west of the Rockies.",

For years, the property owner had a trail for the public to reach the falls.  Recently, the trail has been closed, gated, a camera mounted, and no trespassing signs put up.  Being that it's a mountainous region, that trail is the only realistic way to get from the road to the waterfall, so it is now effectively a private waterfall.  \n\nAlso, there are many areas, large and small, of public land that are inaccessible to the public because they're surrounded by private land, effectively making it private land unless you've got permission to cross private land or if you have a helicopter.\n\nMy issue is that when public land isn't accessible to the public, it effectively becomes private land on which the people who obstruct access aren't paying taxes.  Truth is, I don't want them to be able to own the public land in any capacity because I have a big problem with one person, who may not even live there, having the authority to decide on a whim that this vast swath of land that nobody lives on is off limits to everyone else.  I want it to be a legal requirement that landowners who's property borders public land to allow simple crossing to the public land if there isn't already access to it.  It could be as simple as allowing people to walk from the road along the edge of the property line to get to where the land is public.  Otherwise, like I said, it's just untaxed private land.",

ROFL get fucked, poors - your several hundred dollar fine is just an Enjoyment Tax, and meaningless to ME, says super wealthy assbags.  \n\nThe article OP linked says one property owner was fined $600,000 - after DECADES of blocking beach access.  There are are currently  property listings in Malibu between $22,000,000 to $75,000,000  - do you really think a $600k penalty is going to deter these people?  And that's for DECADES of flagrantly violating code.  You're talking about people buying $50,000 handbags, $150,000 wristwatches and $2,000,000 hypercars, and frequently the Malibu house is just their fourth home.",

The problem is that the rail industry has lobbied to erode government oversight to the point where they have almost no workers and no power. Now that the public is aware of how bad things have gotten, the private companies have no choice but to allow these inspections.\n\nUltimately, this entire debacle is another example of how capitalism is not about free markets. Capitalism is about privatizing profits and socializing costs. Infrastructure should not be a private industry since it is critical to the nation\u2019s survival.",

If you were riding away from your house, it was just a major annoyance because it cut your trip short.\n\nIf the train stopped after you had gone through though it really sucked because it majorly blocked your route home. On a snowmobile it wasn't too bad because you had a motor obviously and you'd just have to ditch ride for the couple like detour on the country roads.  On a bike it was really dangerous however. With all the backtracking and all that to get around it, it was an extra 5 miles minimum and it put you either on gravel roads or rural county roads with minimal shoulders and traffic flying by at 55mph. \n\nThe county just said \"well, we can't prevent it.\" And the railroad basically said \"don't ride that trail then. Not our problem\". It was so fucking ridiculous that a State bike trail could randomly be blocked with zero warning via a train company and your only options as a teenager were to take a large unsafe detour, call for someone to hopefully come and get you and your bike or (as most of us did), climb between the cars and cross the train which isn't exactly safe either.",

I'm not saying necessarily it was 100% intentional but it's benefits to the biden admin when it comes to managing the backlash from this particular disaster are undeniable.\n\nIt's Obvious to anybody it's always better late than never when it comes to any form of safety regulations, however given the level of devastation plus the information the DoT was already aware from the labour negotiations that happened prior about how these Rail companies are managed, I would argue this was already completely preventable and youre ignoring the timeline of events. If the president and more importantly imo the Secretary of Transportation, which I need to emphasize oversees the Land Transportation Office as head of the Dept. of Transportation was proactive about railway safety they would have listened to the safety concerns the railway workers had during the labour negotiations and put hard pressure on the CEOs of these rail companies to address them as well as encourage the house to put forward bills or update safety regulations based on those testimonies.\n\nInstead they caved to corporate pressure and forced the rail workers back to work and also prevented them from striking. They turned their backs on the railway workers safety concerns and then the inevitable disaster at East Palestine happened. \n\nIt would have been one thing if safety bills were put on the table in response to the railway labour dispute and there was push back from neolib democrats and the republican opposition in the house and Senate prior, but they didn't even bother to reach that step and the admin sided with the rail CEOs instead and ignored the explicit safety concerns related to the shrinking number of staff and the overworking of the remaining staff the unions had brought up during negotiations. \n\nThe Biden admin had their shot to be proactive about it before East Palestine happened and they fucking blew it. Therefore I believe my criticism of this particular instance is perfectly valid. The canary in the coal mine was clearly dead in 100% plain sight of everyone who mattered but the explicit choice was made to ignore it, and then the inevitable happened. Then people with similar takes like yours have the audacity to say being reactive to this already preventable disaster should be commended and imply that I'm the one being obtuse for pointing out they could easily been proactive with the information already laid out to them before the catastrophe happened.",

The long trains create numerous safety issues already mentioned, but another one is it encourages more drivers to rush at railroad crossings or even going around gates. It's not just the extended train length, but the additional time long trains take when slowing down / making way for a passing train.\n\nWhile cars and typical pickup trucks are generally no match against a train, dump trucks are another story often leading to derailment causing serious injury and death. Many dump truck operators are paid by number of loads. On an aside, many police seemingly give them a pass when doing speed enforcement. Off on a tangent, but point is that excessively long trains lead to safety issues beyond just the train itself.\n\nIdeally, all train crossings should be grade separated. Realistically that's not financially possible, but they certainly could improve more crossings. Read some articles about the Feds giving out grants to do just that. However, most improvements involve lights and gates versus full separation. So, in the meantime, next best way to address long trains is limiting number of cars and tonnage.",

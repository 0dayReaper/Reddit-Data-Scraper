The first half of the article made it sound like that, but the second half clarified he argued with another person at first arrival who realized it was inappropriate to argue at that time and separated themselves from the situation. Then the owner began to argue with the pastor and pushed him, the pastor pushed back causing the owner to fall. At that time the family began confronting the owner for disrespecting them and he immediately pulled his gun and opened fire. Killing one and injuring a second person seemingly unrelated to the dispute between companies.\n\nEdit: or the owner fell when confronted I guess, but he was on the ground and started blasting.  \nAlso, he shot two people, but only killed one.

Followed by a several years long campaign of trying to forcibly confiscate the remaining hundreds of millions of guns across the width of a continent. There\u2019s half a billion guns in America, and people can still make more after a ban.\n\nThe vast majority of gun deaths in America are suicides. The root cause is dismal mental health.\n\nFurther, homicides are most frequently gang related.\n\nInvesting in healthcare, and investing in neglected communities would do more for gun violence than any gun ban could ever.",

The original purpose of the 2A was not a need for self-defense or a method to overthrow a tyrannical government. It was in response to the founders not wanting to have a standing army but to still have a system to put down rebellions (e.g. the Shays' rebellion). Thus they imagined the \"well-regulated militia\" for such a purpose.\n\nThis current re-imagining of the 2A and subsequent new gun culture is a shift that began only about half a century ago. Prior to that, American society understood carrying weapons around all of the time and using them all of the time was bonkers, and the kind of thing only criminals and villains would do.",

It doesn't require amending to fix the problem, and amending the constitution is *far* more difficult than any of the other ways to correct it.",

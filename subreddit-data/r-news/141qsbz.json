A small Indian woman and her husband got followed into a store by a guy who was probably 6\u20194\u201d and 200lbs. I also went into the store because I was probably as mad as the road rager was and he had no idea. I found the couple and told them I saw what happened and that I would walk through the store with them. They were terrified, justly, because they had no idea why that guy was acting like that. So as we walk I see the guy through the isle and he was walking towards us at a quick pace. I stepped between them as he came into the isle and I probably had a crazy look on my face because I was literally ready to throw fists at any moment and I must have been too much wild card for him because he never said a word and just left the store. I was literally seething so I followed him out and took a picture of his license plate and called the police and gave them the description and the plate. Point being the couple basically had a guy pick them to rage on for no reason at all and I suspect he would have absolutely assaulted one or both of then, again for no reason at all. I was behind them on a motorcycle slowly driving through a parking lot. They had the right of way, no pedestrian traffic, and no stop sign. So as they pass another line of cars the guy comes flying down the isle and essentially tries to cut them off but since the couple were already passed where he could even cut them off he just went nuts. Absolutely no reason at all",

I'm an IOS dev, and it's been known that over time the batteries deteriorate and newer updates slow the processer down to draw out the battery life.\n\nI suppose Apples logic is better battery &gt; better performance with the added benefit of alow performance being blamed on last years tech which leads to higher sales. It's not _exactly_ disengenuos but I understand why it would leave a bad impression on people since downgrading is impossible without jailbreaking",

If you're skeptical and have not heard of the OnePlus simply look up reviews on YouTube, several tech channels have placed the OnePlus 5T in their top 10 phones of 2017 and for good reason.",

Switched to android and have been kicking myself for putting up with apple for so long with that phone.\n\n\nEdit: I booted the phone up to check on it and it still does most of that without its sim card. It's still synced to my accounts so it immediately alerted me to upcoming appointments. I also forgot I left music I paid for on this thing!

A new $500+ device every year?  Companies expect, encourage or even try to force you to update.  Between things like this, OEMs stopping support on devices and not shipping patches, etc it's all set up to sell you a brand new thing every year.",

But this a lose lose situation and people always bring this up. The problem is every phone has a different feature set. So you're always \"encouraging\" a manufacturer to leave something out. No phone has 100% of all the features out there. So for instance, I wanted a phone with a head phone jack. I bought the S8. I'd also love to have stock android. People will tell me \"if you wanted your S8 to behave like stock android, you should have bought a Pixel\" If I would have bought a Pixel... you guessed it I would have been encouraging manufacturers to take out the head phone jack. Now I'm left encouraging manufacturers to be slow with their updates...",

The processors in those devices wanted to hit faster speeds, but their batteries couldn't handle it, **prompting some phones to simply switch themselves off**.\n\nI don't buy it. If this were true, it would happen to all smart phones on the market. If it's a problem that is inherent to Apple products, then Apple products are inherently inferior. \n\nBesides, I've had iPhones and iPads where I deliberately avoided OS updates, and never suffered such problems, even after they were seven or eight years old. What ultimately caused them to shut off unexpectedly was me dropping them by accident. ",

When a company goes bankrupt I thought there was a pecking order on what gets paid off first. And if you were owed money there's a good chance you're not getting anything out of that company. Hell, a National Co-op filed for creditor protection and we all lost our accumulated shares in the company (Canada).\n\nThis is why I thought the DTCC upped their collateral requirement, to make sure they weren't on the hook when Melvin shat the bed and couldn't actually make the payment on their end. But if they've only lost 50% then to me that means they had another 50% that they could have liquidated to cover their shorts, so they weren't quite at the point of going bust. So why did DTCC up collateral?! \n\nI mean, I know nothing. I went from watching The Big Short several times over the years and not understanding anything, to FINALLY getting most of in last night because everything I've watched and read in the last week.",

Worldwide, the last time this happened was the [Volkswagen Squeeze of 2008](https://www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26), in which Porsche fought for control of the company.

Even though he was supposed to have won big during the crash of 1929, he blew everything by 1934 and filed for bankruptcy. He struggled on for another 6 years before finally committing suicide.",

It already is, really, but if the funds plant even the slightest idea in peoples' minds that this was all orchestrated by a far right extremist group or whatever other tricks they might have up their sleeves then we will never see the short squeeze and this will all be for nothing but the financial benefit of a few hundred people. \n\nIts imperative that everyone knows what this is, what its about, where it could lead, how we can get there, and that the people who are at risk here will literally do anything to come out on top, including risking prison time. Again, they've already done that. They have connections and resources that dwarf the power of the individual investors, but if the individual investors hold and ignore the propaganda that's all it will take to trigger the squeeze. $69,420 lets go.",

And the short sellers gamestop bubble burst hard.\n\nThat's why what this risk the short sellers took deserves the most attention.. they put a lot of risk on themselves, their investors, and quite potentially other unwitting market players.

They've gotten where they are by fucking everyone and up to this point no one thought they had the collective power to do anything about it. Turns out, WSB got pretty big last year. Not to mention, you've got a shit ton of bored, pissed off young people with no jobs and no prospects for vertical movement that are waiting for months for congress to trickle a little droplet of capital their direction. Saving feels pointless and the idea that you can work hard and become wealthy is dead, so the general sentiment is \"fuck it.\" You either wake up tomorrow with 3 years salary in your brokerage account or you lose the money you weren't gonna get rich with anyway. If you end up taking down some elitist shitheads in the process, even better.\n\nObligatory this is not investment advice, just an observation.",

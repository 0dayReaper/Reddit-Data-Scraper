Then he finds out Bob Lee is doing ketamine and sex with his sister so he acts like it's all good, offers to give him a ride to his hotel and shanks him in the nice part of town.

Even if you ignore the context (contradictory statements, the fact that police referred to him as both a potential suspect *and* victim, prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to make the charges stick, etc...) this happened 18 years ago. Even if he was convicted back in 05 he likely would've been out at this point. \n\nThe simple battery charge is even stupider, the **maximum** sentence is only 6 months and/or a fine.

He rarely speaks and has been weirding out his friends and housemates because when he's really high he  won't respond to people in the room. Catatonic. Then he finds out Bob Lee is doing ketamine and sex with his sister so he acts like it's all good, offers to give him a ride to his hotel and shanks him in the nice part of town. Leaves him on the sidewalk to die. The motive here is drugs drugs drugs and ego. Hope they lock dude up , he will prob like prison with all the drugs and shanks they have inside",

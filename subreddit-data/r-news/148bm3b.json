The security guy was telling me it\u2019s about 2-3 times a month that somebody gets shot in that area. \n\nWalked from the arena to our hotel after the game and debated going back. It was pretty wild out. You probably couldn\u2019t distinguish the gunfire from the fireworks drowned in car horns.",

The girl reportedly said the Uzi was \"too much\" for her after she fired the weapon and was unable to control the muzzle rise, causing the barrel to be directed at Vacca. Vacca is believed to have died from a single shot to the head.\n\n\nYeah no shit it was too hard for her to control, she headshot the employee.",

Your medical malpractice system was struggling with some crazy high payouts.  And pain and suffering payouts can be biased/unfair - sympathetic victim with a good lawyer and rich target gets more.  Economic losses are still a bit unfair (rich have better access to the expensive medical treatment in the first place, plus they\u2019ll get more for lost work income) but they\u2019re at least based on some specific numbers.\n\nCompletely separate to all that, it sounds like the victim\u2019s compensation fund should be much higher.  If it\u2019s covering medical bills, $50k goes nowhere.   (We have something similar in Australia but it\u2019s only for things that wouldn\u2019t already be provided free.   I knew someone who got assaulted on a bus and got $10k to help buy a car because they had PTSD and couldn\u2019t use public transport any more.)",

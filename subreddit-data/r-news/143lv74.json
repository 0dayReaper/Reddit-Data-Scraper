The impound yard might just as well have had a line just for Hyundai owners, as there were 5 there besides ourselves. It boggles my mind that not only Hyundai but the insurance co. never reached out to inform us that there was an increased risk of theft.",

The argument is generally along the lines that selling something without \"industry standard\" safety features that are expected by a reasonable consumer is essentially selling a defective product, and a known dangerous one at that. For example, peloton's treadmill lacking a guard while virtually every other treadmill made in the last god knows how many years have one because injuries are a known issue, especially with children and pets. Its just an \"extra\" part that wasn't in the design, but was considered a defect.\n\nSelling a car that's unique in how easy it is to steal is definitely a public safety issue, and its not as though they advertise the lack of an otherwise ubiquitous immobilizer. Seems to me they've got a leg to stand on, if a pretty grey one.",

They're often stolen, driven at high speed, ignoring red lights, and generally unsafely to say the least. I've seen that happen 3 times myself. Luckily they all crashed into parked cars and the driver even got out and walked away. No one was hurt in those cases, but that's not always the case.\n\nIt's not their *fault*, but police chases are an inevitable result of the increased theft. Agree with police chases or not (I don't ~95% of the time), that's still a foreseeable outcome. It's not really any different than people getting killed in a reckless joyride.\n\nAlso I don't mean to argue who should come out ahead in the lawsuit, I don't know enough of the details for that. I'm just rambling on about what the precedence for a negligence lawsuit would be, to the best of my knowledge.",

Then, in 2009, they released [preliminary findings](http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811115.PDF) that across all situations, *including those in which turn signals don\u2019t matter*, vehicles with amber rear turn signals are **5.3% less likely to be hit** from behind than otherwise-identical vehicles with red ones.  \nThat means amber turn signals were seen as being *more* effective at avoiding crashes than the center third brake light (CHMSL) mandated in 1986 (with a 4.3% crash avoidance).",

There's so many cars that are affected by this that you could probably drive around your city/neighborhood for about ten minutes and find at least one car waiting to be stolen. (Assuming you're in the US.) [This article has more specifics,](https://www.thedrive.com/news/these-hyundai-and-kia-models-are-blacklisted-by-state-farm-insurance-over-thefts) but here's the gist:\n&gt;According to the list received by WWL-TV, the affected Hyundai and Kia models are as follows:\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Hyundai Accent (all body styles)\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Hyundai Elantra (two-door and four-door)\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Hyundai Kona\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Hyundai Santa Fe\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Hyundai Tucson\n\n&gt;2015-2018 Hyundai Veloster\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Kia Forte\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Kia Optima\n\n&gt;2015-2016 Kia Optima Hybrid\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Kia Rio (all body styles)\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Kia Sedona\n\n&gt;2015-2016 Kia Sorento\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Kia Soul\n\n&gt;2015-2021 Kia Sportage\n\nState Farm is literally refusing to insure these vehicles for that reason.",

It doesn't include Sonatas, which is what I had before it was stolen exactly the way TikTok says to in February. It happened four days after I submitted my final car payment. I'm bitter about it and I want to get the word out. If you have a 2015-2021 Hyundai, get rid of it ASAP! They're coming for your car too!",

It\u2019s not the manufacturers fault tho, it\u2019s tiktok. Make sure to also disregard the fact that the guides on how to easily steal these cars (that were built in a way that makes them easy to steal) are plastered all over YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook as well.\n\nCrazy how y\u2019all try to frame this as a tiktok issue, as opposed to a Kia/Hyundai failure, considering older cars and newer cares with different makes are doing just fine.",

Despite that, only recently has one of the Korean brands broken onto that list and it's the Kia Rio of all things.\n\nHyundai and Kia should be held accountable for their ridiculous decision to omit immobilizers but I find it rich that cities is suing. They're terrible at responding to anything other than violent crime and in lower income neighborhoods there's this general sense that they're dismissive about theft.",

I infer NOTHING ELSE. I bring up NOTHING ELSE. I refute you saying that they will refuse to insure those vehicles and you somehow try and change the subject to something else.",

What I suggested they MIGHT do appears to be what they are actually currently doing in New York, to some degree.  I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re unable to make your argument without being a douchebag.  It certainly makes people less likely to be agreeable.

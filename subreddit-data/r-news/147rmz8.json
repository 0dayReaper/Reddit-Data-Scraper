My own dashcam showed me come to a full stop, cop claimed I \"blew right through\" the sign.\n\nShowed the dashcam video to the city prosecutor. \"We're continuing with the case.\" Great. $200 ticket.\n\nDemanded a jury trial (you can do this in Georgia, but not all states let you.) Case bound over to State Court and dismissed long before any trial.\n\nThe kicker? I had to pay a $25 fee for the court to \"record\" the dismissal. Bastards, all of them.",

Here\u2019s how it goes, you sue the municipality pay a 40 dollar filing fee. They draw the case out for months and before trial agree to pay back the 15 dollars. Or let the judgement go through and don\u2019t appeal it. It\u2019ll never go any higher never go to the Supreme Court because they\u2019ll just make it very expensive and handle it on a one on one case. So is a civil rights org going to spend their resources fighting for 15 dollars, or fighting for people who are being charged with domestic terrorism for protesting. Money is a zero sum game.",

Maybe the lawyers would get their fees as part of the deal, but the amount they can collect is effectively limited. And it takes a lot of resources that are better spent on other cases.\n\nHonestly your best bet is if a lawyer gets one of these, and decides to fight it out of spite and looks for class representation.",

Qualified immunity is a cheap patch, made up by judges, who are not held responsible for their results. Some expert judicial council should be figuring that out. Too bad we have an 18th-century model of governance.\n\nI do think to some extent the courts really do just trust cops more than the average person. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to give cops immunity because they\u2019re generally trying their best to do the right thing.\u201d Another bit of logic they\u2019d never apply to anyone else.",

That's true for leadership, but the average guy is simply un-prepared to diagnose the lies he's being told by said leadership.\n\nWhich was kind of my point, education leads people to more progressive thought.  \n\nBut people also react badly to being called dumb or evil making them that much harder to win over with reason.  Instead of inspiring them to be better educated they just think the people with education are elitist assholes with no common sense.\n\nIt's a tough line to walk, especially when they get reactionary &amp; say fucked up things that deserve to be slapped down.",

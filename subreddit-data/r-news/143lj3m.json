He hasn't been in it for at least a season or two because of his involvement. Hard to imagine being someone whose image is dependent on not doing dumb shit and then going to do dumb shit. Even if you're really fired up about your convictions, you should probably do it from home.\n\nBut they haven't really done anything with it. Jimmy Jr. is still around and his brothers but Pesto is hardly even referenced. I think they should just straight up recast him. They've recast side characters before and I honestly don't think anyone would care.",

With the exception of some rare and fleeting moments, Frank never had the character depth to be anything more than a punchline, or the butt of joke. \n\nAlthough I do still enjoy the earlier seasons, I feel as though later seasons had a much better opportunity to tell actually meaningful and dramatic stories. The extra depth offered by properly complex and realistic characters elevated the show to far greater heights than it ever could have, should it have been continued to be weighed down by characters like Frank and Trapper. \n\nPerhaps I'm just biased by my memories, but I have the general impression that the earlier seasons were by in large much more simplistic and juvenile on average. Even though I had first been rather surprised by each sudden replacement, I found the new characters to be a flat improvement over those that left.\n\nIn the end, I was quite happy with the introduction of Charles and BJ over Frank and Trapper respectively. However, although Colonel Potter was great, I will always miss and pity Henry Blake. As sad as it was, that reveal was a truly iconic moment in American television.",

And it was from the top down:\n\nOn November 9, 2020, just six days after he lost the 2020 Presidential election, Trump fired Mark Esper and named Chris Miller the Acting Secretary of Defense.\n\nOn Jan 4th, 2021, just 2 days before the attack, that same Acting Secretary of Defense, Chris Miller, [released a detailed memo requiring his \u201cpersonal authorization\u201d for DC National Guard to deploy, to employ weapons, riot control agents &amp; other tactics at Jan. 6](https://twitter.com/lukebroadwater/status/1354836817925832705)\n\nMiller's Memo SPECIFICALLY STATED:\n\n*DCNG may not be \"issued weapons, ammunition, bayonets, batons, or ballistic protection equipment such as helmets and body armor\" ... so they can't have any weapons or armor, which they might need in case of a riot.\n\n*DCNG would not be allowed to \"interact physically with protestors, except when necessary in self-defense or defense with others\" ... so they would not be allowed to in ANY WAY prevent the insurrectionists from, say, storming the Capitol.\n\n*DCNG would not be allowed to \"employ any riot control agents\" ... so they'd get no pepper spray or water cannons or shields or rubber bullets.\n\n*DCNG would not be allowed \"to share equipment with law enforcement agencies\" ... so DCNG, which had armor and riot control agents it couldn't use, couldn't give any of that to DC police or Capitol Police or Maryland's National Guard.\n\n*DCNG couldn't \"use Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets\" or \"conduct ISR or Incident, Awareness, and Assessment activities\" ... so they couldn't try to find out what was going on beyond what they could immediately see.\n\n*DCNG couldn't \"employ helicopters or any other air assets\" ... so, again, they couldn't get eyes above the city to see what was happening, or to move troops people rapidly around.\n\n*DCNG couldn't \"conduct searches, seizures, arrests, or other similar direct law enforcement activity\" Military forces usually can't do law enforcement, but Miller's telling them they can't even detain insurrectionist terrorists. Have to just let them do what they do.\n\n*DCNG can't \"seek support from any non-DCNG National Guard units\" ... so they couldn't ask Maryland or Virginia National Guard (which didn't have these restrictions) to help them.\n\nSo let's be clear:\n\nActing Secretary of Defense Miller put out a memo on Jan 4 - ORDERING THE DC NATIONAL GUARD TO DO NOTHING on Jan 6, and denied them ANY possibility of being able to respond to Trump's upcoming insurrection.\n\nThis was after the FBI and other intelligence agencies informed Miller about multiple right-wing terrorist organizations planning to riot in DC on Jan 6.\n\nStill shocking it's not a bigger story.",

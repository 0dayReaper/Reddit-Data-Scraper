I'd just call collect and say \"Come get me\" and hang up.  Worked like a charm.\n\nAnother mostly forgotten thing, when I was in college you had to get prepaid calling cards to call home.  Sometimes when they were on sale you could make long distance calls cheaper than any other carrier.  We had one system built in at the college that billed your account but it was cheaper to get calling cards at walmart or gas stations.",

Do you have any idea how many \"Mickey Mouse\" write-ins there are, *every single year*? For the past few years, \"Harambe\" write-ins have had a substantial presence as well. My brother told me he wrote-in his dog's name in 2016. \n\nThe average voter is stupid *as fuck*. I mean really, really, really, **really** stupid. There are thousands upon thousands of people whose exact thought process would be, \"haha wouldn't it be funny if Kanye was President? Yeah I'll vote for him ha ha ha\"",

Even if you can show them the evidence that sex ed and contraceptives are the best method to prevent abortions. They'd rather people have back alley abortions as long as they get to punish the desperate people who do that.\n\nSame with poverty and mental health, they are fine with spending tons of money to incarcerate and abuse the poor and mentally ill, but the second you suggest using public funds for treatment and jobs programs they are furious.\n\nAlso with capital punishment, many people will acknowledge that we kill innocent people due to flaws in the legal system, but they're ok with those deaths if the really bad people die too.\n\nSame with \"the war on terror\", we'll happily spend trillions and ultimately create more terrorists and that's fine with this group of people but if you dare to suggest we should provide aid to help stabilize those countries, or accept refugees caused by our actions they'll become apoplectic and call you all kinds of names.\n\nI don't know how we are ever going to change that mindset.",

I'm not blaming his behavior on bipolar disorder, but if he does have it as he's said in the past, I really hope he gets help. That's my issue here. I would rather him normalize getting help, especially as a black man given the taboo nature it can have amongst blacks.

Jesus is King.\u201d\n\n&gt;West rebuffed various attempts to clarify who was driving his ballot access or strategy and whether it\u2019s being coordinated by or with Republican-affiliated officials. He does, however, appear to have a continuing relationship with the Trump White House. West says that he\u2019s \u201cdesigning a school within the next month\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m meeting with Betsy DeVos about the post-Covid curriculum.\u201d (The Secretary of Education\u2019s press office hadn\u2019t responded to a request for comment by the time we published.)\n\u201cI like Kanye very much,\u201d President Trump told reporters at the White House yesterday. \u201cNo, I have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot. We'll have to see what happens.\u201d\n\n&gt;West\u2019s intentions have come under increased scrutiny this week, following reports by CNN, New York, the New York Times and others, about efforts by GOP political operatives to get him onto several ballots, including states like Wisconsin that could be pivotal in deciding the next president. West has been a vocal Trump supporter, including visiting the president in the Oval Office. Texts from West to me earlier this summer repeatedly ended with the sign-off \u201cTrump 2020,\u201d and a fist raised high. West\u2019s recent actions have also drawn public focus, given his bipolar disorder\u2014and many, including his wife, Kim Kardashian-West, have expressed concern about his mental health.\n\n&gt;West did not respond when asked whether he feels he\u2019s being used. When I pointed out to West that the slapdash operation to get him on the ballot, which includes one operative previously arrested for voter fraud and multiple West \u201celectors\u201d from the same address, didn\u2019t feel like a Kanye West production, West replied that it was a \u201cGod production.\u201d\n\n&gt;In a wide-ranging interview with Forbes last month about his political aspirations, West, who has never voted before, laid out a platform for his \u201cBirthday Party\u201d that included a pro-life plank that alleged that Planned Parenthood was placed in cities by white supremacists, a management style patterned on the fictional country of Wakanda in Black Panther and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. In that interview, West also claimed that he was dumping Trump. \u201cI am taking the red hat off, with this interview.\u201d His reason: \u201cIt looks like one big mess to me. I don\u2019t like that I caught wind that he hid in the bunker.\u201d\n\n&gt;However, he was reticent to criticize Trump besides that. \u201cTrump is the closest president we\u2019ve had in years to allowing God to still be part of the conversation,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt;And West was eager to criticize Biden, and expressed comfort with the idea of doing damage to the former vice president\u2019s White House chances. \u201cI\u2019m not denying it; I just told you.\u201d",

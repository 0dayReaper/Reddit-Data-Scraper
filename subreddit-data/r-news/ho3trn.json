He is a narcissist too so failure or giving up is never an option\n2. He wants to prove he is equal to or better than other presidents (Specifically Clinton and Obama).  Being a \"one-term loser\" is not something he will willing be.\n3. He is the center of attention as President.  He knows this so this feeds into the narcissim.\n\nWhile first families don't have to pay rent or utilities at the White House, they are responsible for personal costs that can multiply.  Meals ate at the White House or the presidential Camp David retreat are billed, dry cleaning, food bills for private parties and hourly wages for waiters and cleanup crews at private parties.   You know those teams who win College or Pro-level championships?  That is considered a 'private party' and the President is billed for the food and wages.  Put's the 'fast food party' into perspective.Most presidents end up broke by the time they leave the White House (though they write books and give paid speeches/appearances to offset those bills when they leave office.\n\nAll that said, Trump figured out that being President is profitable for him.\n\nYou know why he does all those trips to his own clubs nearly every weekend...he charges the government for all the equipment rental, lodging and meals.  Both because of a \"f u\" for being billed ..and because he learned he could make money from the Government.  It's free money and you know that when he leaves office, he has a full-time Secret Service detail which he will charge the government for lodging at Mar-a-largo.\n\nThink about this, he was sworn into office on January 20th, 2017.  Trump's first visit to Mar-a-Lago as president of the United States was the weekend of February 3\u20136, 2017, just a few days after he got his first bill from the Government for the Inauguration parties and first weeks of living in the White House. Puts his trips into perspective as well doesn't it?",

The office demands someone with basic competency, basic decency, basic work ethic, and basic allegiance to the United States above self.  Every day this man gets up, lounges around watching Fox News and going on Twitter tirades full of blatant lies, while waving away briefings and his other basic job responsibilities.

Many people need to take the bus to get to their polling center, but the bus driver needs to vote, too.\n\nMore polling centers should be the first step. In 15 elections (including locals and runoffs) in California, I\u2019ve only had to wait in line for more than 5 minutes ONCE. That\u2019s how it should be for everyone.\n\nEarly voting and vote-by-mail voting (which is extra important in the middle of a pandemic) solve the problem. If we do that, I don\u2019t have any problem also making Election Day a holiday.",

            "comment": "*Edited to better reflect the Mazars decision*\n\nSummary:\n\n - *Both* cases were decided 7-2 with opinions that nominally go against Trump's interests. [Vance](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-635_o7jq.pdf) - which concludes that records must go to the New York State Prosecutor, and [Mazars](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-715_febh.pdf) - which strongly implies Congress has a right to some records, but that the breadth of their requests requires further separation of powers consideration.\n \n - Still, **Trump has emphatically won for the purposes of the 2020 election**. Both cases are remanded to lower courts, nothing will happen before the election.\n \n - The writing appears to be on the wall. Ultimately, everything requested is going to prosecutors in New York, and Congress will get some or all of what it requests eventually.\n \nWhether he is President or not, the next few years are likely to be very uncomfortable for Donald Trump.\n\nWhen records do go to investigators and Congress next year, Trump will face scrutiny of at least (1) potential corrupt business partnerships and money-laundering (particularly with Russia) (2) evidence of Tax Evasion (3) evidence of his shockingly poor record as a businessman (of no legal consequence, but likely to be personally embarassing).\n\nHere is a summary of what we know so far.\n\n---\n\n***Corrupt business partners, cash flow, and potential money-laundering for Russians via Deutsche Bank***\n\nWe know that some of Trump Org's most lucrative business in the years leading up to the election was partnering his brand to facially corrupt building projects deals with Russian oligarchs in former Soviet States, most notably in [Georgia](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/trumps-business-of-corruption) and [Azerbaijan](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal). There are deals that likely violate the [Foreign Corrupt Practices Act](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act) that Trump has been [determined to weaken](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/31/trump-fcpa/) since taking office, but which would be exceedingly difficult to prosecute, since he is just a licensor.\n\nMore tantalizing are the mysterious assets he actually claims to own and operate himself. We still have no coherent explanation for Trump Org's massive [all-cash spending spree](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-the-king-of-debt-trump-borrowed-to-build-his-empire-then-he-began-spending-hundreds-of-millions-in-cash/2018/05/05/28fe54b4-44c4-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html) on golf courses, peaking [during the period (2010-2014)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6l2z-MCzL1xKW0TLSsNHKq00Mvw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4FWHKFSQYMI6RBOBSMTMIUIQGM.jpg) that precisely aligns with Deutsche Bank's heaviest period [of Russian money laundering](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/17/deutsche-bank-faces-action-over-20bn-russian-money-laundering-scheme), when Eric Trump contemporaneously explained to golf writer that all of [their financing was coming from Russia](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/eric-trump-russia-investment-golf-course). \n\n&gt;\u201cSo when I got in the cart with Eric,\u201d Dodson says, \u201cas we were setting off, I said, \u2018Eric, who\u2019s funding? I know no banks\u2014because of the recession, the Great Recession\u2014have touched a golf course. You know, no one\u2019s funding any kind of golf construction. It\u2019s dead in the water the last four or five years.\u2019 And this is what he said. He said, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t rely on American banks. **We have all the funding we need out of Russia**.\u2019 I said, \u2018Really?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, yeah. We\u2019ve got some guys that really, really love golf, and they\u2019re really invested in our programs. We just go there all the time.\u2019 \n\nDeutsche records may also shed light on their apparent freakout regarding Trump and Russia right around the election. Shortly before election day, Trump was predictably having a hard time with the aforementioned golf courses (which were [objectively awful](https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/where-did-donald-trump-get-200-million-dollars-to-buy-his-money-losing-scottish-golf-club) investments that continue to [lose money](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-scotland-golf-courses-inflating-value_n_5d5c1ccce4b05f62fbd5f559)) and needed a bailout. This is when Deutsche Bank appears to have finally realized the gravity of the situation, and [denied his loan request](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/business/trump-deutsche-bank.html), even though it was to just be an extension of loans for his (at the time, profitable) Doral property. Then when he actually won and Russia's election assistance was revealed, Deutsche [raced to unload  a considerable $600 million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-in-late-2016-raced-to-shed-loan-it-made-to-russian-bank-vtb-11549147289) loan to VTB ([the originally planned financier for Trump Tower Moscow](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/29/events-that-lead-trumps-abandoned-moscow-deal-michael-cohens-latest-plea-agreement/?utm_term=.f3cd69a4f320)). The loan had no documented purpose in DB's records, and was structured to allow VTB to deploy the cash however it wished.\n\n***Tax Evasion***\n\nFrom [Trump Org Tax returns from 70s to the 90s](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html), we learned that virtually all of Trump's wealth was simply given to him directly by his father. $400 million of transferred wealth through a massive tax evasion scheme, bailing Trump out of one failure after another until he was well into his 50s.\n\n***Embarassing Business Record***\n\nIn summaries of his personal Tax returns [from the late 80s and early 90s](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html), we learned that Donald **Trump was likely the single greatest loser of money among all taxpayers** in the entire United States in that time period.",

That leads to him making calls, such as in the transgender discrimination case, that some people call \"liberal\" while it's really just a strict reading of the law. Basically, his thinking in that case is basically \"because the law specifies 'sex', substitute any number of people of different sexes in the scenario, and if it would have a different result by changing the actors' sexes, then there is illegal discrimination.\" That's a 100% strict reading of the law as it was written and passed by Congress. Is it a \"liberal\" opinion? No. It is a quite conservative opinion in that it's based on a strict reading of the laws. But it does fit a more liberal worldview of how our country should be in terms of its result.",

They sat there and waited while kids were shot one by one.  They finally charged in once they had about 20 officers in heavy gear.  Even the shooter was like \"wtf, why are there no cops here!?\".  \n\nThe Parkland shooting was almost amusing, in a way.  After he shot up the school, Nikolas Cruz just dropped his gear on the floor and left the building.  Then he went down to McDonalds and had some food.  There he met the brother of one of the students he shot.  They sat down and had a chat.",

Your safety, security and protection in the US are 100% up to you. (Warren v. District of Columbia, Castle Rock v. Gonzales, Lozito v. New York City, DeShaney v. Winnebago County) \r  \n\r  \nIn Lozito v. New York for instance. A police officer walked up on Lozito being actively stabbed and instead of helping went and hid. The lawsuit was dismissed because they argued successfully the police have no \"special duty to protect\" Lozito or anyone else.\r  \n\r  \nThe situation was also highlighted perfectly in Uvalde. The cops have no legal obligation to protect children from being shot but have the authority to stop parents from trying to save their kids. In my opinion those two things are mutually exclusive and must be sorted out before an argument can be made that a blanket ban is the best course  \n\n\nIt is also indicated in the Special Relationship Doctrine. The SRP is a legal principle that makes the state liable for the harm inflicted on the individual by a third party provided that the state has assumed control over the individual which is sufficient to trigger an affirmative duty to provide protection to that individual. This shows that the governments default position is to NOT provide a duty to protect individuals UNLESS they take you into custody. If you are NOT in custody you are owed no protections from the government.",

When you don't even have the body armor police officers have?\n\nSecond, if you decide not to risk your life, people will be blaming you for hiding when you had a gun and will smear you for it. And the police will point the finger at you to protect their own.\n\nThird, if someone accidentally gets shot by you, you don't have the same sort of protection as police officers to back you.",

I have a lot more for the Parkland cop (cop, singular) than for the whole squad that cowered outside the doors at Uvalde at least.  One cop alone, with no backup, could wind up throwing his life away if he goes in there like an action hero.\n\nPerhaps he should have done it anyway, He probably had a duty to do so, but you can at least make an argument against trying to solo an active gunman when you're on the scene alone. \n\n In a 1v1 fight in a building that's literally made of transition points, anything can happen.  Schools are full of points where an ambush isn't only possible but easy.  No one, not even a police officer, actually wants to get shot if he can help it and there's a very distinct possibility that if he'd gone in alone, all he would have accomplished is adding 1 cop to the casualty list.\n\nNow in Uvalde when you had the whole squad there in riot gear, and they still didn't breach, that was cowardly.  Perhaps Parkland was too, but it's a lot less clear-cut than people are making it out to be.",

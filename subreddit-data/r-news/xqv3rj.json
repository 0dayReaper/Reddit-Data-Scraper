Trump pumps it upp, gets the rubes.  One of the Republican grifting PACs comes in and buys the thing for 500% over value - a couple billion.  The original investors make bank and bow out.  \n\nThe problem is that Truth Social is viscous urea.  Some grifter PAC might buy it for 500% of the value but the value right now is used toilet water.  So there would definitely be SEC eyeballs on any ludicrous transaction.\n\nIn other words, these social australopithecines grifted themselves.",

She's a Nazi: like barely a fucking shade away from open neo-nazism, and doesn't believe in the right to privacy for anyone else.\n\nCivility and mutual expectations of rights are a non-agression pact, not a straightjacket. You need not be compelled to respect the rights or privacy of those who actively infringe on your own, even as you simultaneously hold those values dearly with others that share your convictions.  If we agree that war is bad, and a single nation breaks that implicit agreement, you can and should use the same level of force in response.  If not they will conquer all the surrounding nations and get rid of this \"meek\" notion.  If we agree kidnapping is bad and a kidnapper kidnaps people, we typically kidnap the kidnapper and put them in jail so they don't do that anymore.  If we agree that free speech is a good idea, and someone uses that free speech to call for less free speach, we can and should shout them down aggressively.  And if someone uses guns to do violence and murder, we can and should shoot them if necessary.\n\nShe is a fascist, we should treat her like one.  So far we know she doesn't respect anyone's right to privacy, we shouldn't respect hers.  She doesn't respect the truth, fucking lie about her flagrantly for all I care, call her a baby murderer serial killer if you feel like it.  Don't get trapped by an unreasonable expectation of civility here, if you think she probably beat the shit out of this man or verbally abused him or whatever else, which I do, I would actively encourage you to shout it to the rooftops with all the conviction of a conspirarcy theorist.  \n\nAnyway that's my hot take for the day. Guess I burned through that within 13 minutes lol",

I think it's pretty telling that I'd literally never heard of this guy until I read the article. MTG appears on some dumbass headline every other hour, it seems, but I've never seen her husband included. He seems to shun the limelight. \n\nTBH, even if he absolutely agrees with her batshittery, I bet he's just done being on the merry-go-round with this. She also might literally never be home, so it's pretty much like being divorced, anyway. The politicians who seem to be closer with their spouses appear publicly together.",

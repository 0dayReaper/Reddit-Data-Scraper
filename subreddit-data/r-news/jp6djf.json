And by the time you get the call they already have a missile lock on you. There are things like flight plans that have to be submitted after all.

Small two-seater planes often do not file flight plans if they don't intend to go far.\n\n\nThe readiness alert level is also going to be pretty low. You're going to have pilots not in flight suits/near their planes with the planes cold and sitting in their hangars. \n\nThe country that maintains the highest readiness level at all times is Israel. With them some pilots are in their flight suits next to their planes in a hangar.\n\nA one mile no fly zone is basically nothing. The only usefulness is so that they can arrest you once you land after entering it.",

There are no pilots whose job it is to sit in a jet on an airfield burning gas all day holding 24/7 alert 5 status. There are no fighter aircraft locking up aircraft flying towards restricted airspace. Restricted airspace exists all over the place - prisons are restricted airspace, many power plants are restricted airspace, military practice areas... etc etc etc. \n\nNORAD callout for domestic incidents are incredibly rare. The most widely known one was the SEATAC incident of 2018 where a Q400 was stolen by a worker. People in the local area reported hearing sonic booms from the Air National Guard F-15s being scrambled and doing a supersonic intercept. Even then, the authority to assign weapons to a target is probably held no more than one step from the president. There are so many considerations. What if you're wrong? What about collateral damage?",

            "comment": "New restricted \"national defense airspace\" has been put in place over Democratic nominee Joe Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration posted the Temporary Flight Restriction on Wednesday, the day after the general election. An FAA notice to pilots available online shows the one mile radius no-fly zone is now active until next Wednesday morning.\n\nThe FAA says airspace has also been temporarily restricted over the nearby Chase Center, where the stage is set for a possible Biden victory speech \u2013 should he ultimately win the presidential election.\u00a0\n\n*Flight restrictions of this kind are standard security protocol for a major party\u2019s nominee for president. A sitting President typically gets a 30-mile ring of roving restricted airspace for any travel away from the nation\u2019s capital.*\n\nMore US Secret Service agents have also been sent to Wilmington, Delaware, in anticipation of a potential Joe Biden presidential win, CNN has learned.\u00a0\n\nThe extra Secret Service agents were sent to Delaware on Thursday, two sources said, with one law enforcement source telling CNN, \u201cThis was anticipated.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEdit: If you go to the link of the post, When I had copied it from CNN live feed, this part was not there,\n\n[Here is the proof](https://web.archive.org/web/20201106151624/https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-biden-election-results-11-06-20/h_8cd2333f39a78ee9080a753e0433035a)\n\nI sincerely apologies :(\n\nI have added the **newly edited** paragraph above in *italic*",

They needed someone to protect VIPs that was neutral and close by. The treasury building was right down the street and they already had well trained gunfighters and such since they were in charge of protecting money shipments and doing investigation for counterfeits. So they were also assigned to protecting politicians since literally down the street and with good people and the rest is history.",

You just...shut your party leaning off for the day, because something bigger than party matters, if you even had one to begin with. The accuracy, the security, and making sure everyone with the right to vote gets to vote does? That is everything. Without that, a victory would be hollow and false, and a loss would be bitter and poisoned. So long as it's clean and honest, you almost don't care which candidate wins on the day.\n\nAlso, you get to see lots of neighbors n'at, which is nice, and oftentimes there's a ballot initiative or two that matters the world to you and has jack-all to do with the politicians.\n\nA state constitutional amendment I care very much about passed in my precinct my first election as a poll worker. I am so very, very happy about it, and it was such an honor to check people in and watch over the lines as that good change got voted in. 86% of voters supported it, so it wasn't exactly controversial, but it was important to me and it meant a very great deal to several of the voters I saw personally, so when I saw the results and was able to connect faces in my memory with that joyful news, even though it seems like such a little thing...I had something to rejoice over that very night. I was so tired, my throat was sore like I'd been greeting people all day, 'cause I had and all, and my clothes reeked of the disinfectant we used for the stations and the booths. The shower I took and the dinner I ate that night, very little has felt as justifiedly luxurious and grand. I highly recommend signing up as a poll worker.\n\nThat, and you get to see what people put down for write-ins on the final tape count. That was fun.",

You underestimate the Secret Service or just don't really understand what it's like to an actual bodyguard and having to stay *en guarde* the entire time that, you know, you're guarding someone like the President. A country club's *exclusive membership* isn't going to stop someone wanting to kill the President.",

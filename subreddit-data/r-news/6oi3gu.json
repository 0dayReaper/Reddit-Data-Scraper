            "comment": "Learning about this really hit me in the gut. \n\nI'm 30 years old now and I got into Linkin Park when I was just a freshman back in highschool in 2000. I had a very rough childhood because I have a scar that disfigures part of my face, I was teased for much of my life and I was always the 'odd' kid. Highschool made it all worse and I didn't have anyone to really...fall back on. I came from a poor family, my mom was a drug addict, my dad fell back into alcoholism when my nanny (his mother) died. I didn't have very many friends. All I had were my books. I was really struggling and I had a few acquiescence I had made with some goth and punk kids. \n\n\nWell, one day, one of them I'd say I was friends with came to me and gave me this beat up discman. It was blue and silver and covered in stickers. They also gave me a burned copy of Hybrid Theory and told me \"you should really listen to this\". I did and like...I just remember having this intense, tingling feeling rush through me. For as much as people make fun of linkin park's lyrics these days, to someone in that mind state it really...speaks to them. \n\n\nAs I listened to the songs I realized everything they sung about was what I was going through and that meant there were people out there who did understand. They understood, they made it through and now here they are, singing about it. That revelation stopped me from ending my life.\n\n\nOne of their songs asks \"What am I leaving when i'm done here?\". I wish more than anything I would have been able to tell Chester and the rest of the band that atleast ONE thing, of many, they left was a young girl who found a way to fight through their depression and keep going forward.\n\nEdit: Oh wow, I didn't expect this comment to get the attention it did. What a surprising thing to come home to. Thank you so very much to everyone who has liked this, commented on this, and to the wonderful user who gave me my first ever reddit gold. The messages I've received for having shared this bit of my past have truly been uplifting and I am so glad there are so many great people supporting each other here. \n\nEdit2: I'm truly beyond words. Thank you so much for the great things you've said. I'm trying to respond to everyone who has commented or messaged me but that's a bit of a larger task than I can manage at the moment. You are all so very wonderful for showing how much you care and supporting your fellow fans. ",

There's very few other bands I've found that in, and sadly I stopped listening to LP after our tastes diverged. But those two or three albums will stick with me my entire life. They helped me with so much, and in some ways made me feel whole when I was just a broken, lost kid. ",

Bought meteora the day it came out and binged on it so hard. As time passed I started listening to other types of genres, eventually stopped following them but occasionally checked out their new stuff. Chester was the first person's voice who I could relate to, I always thought I had to have a super masculine singing voice, but when I heard him and how great he sounded in In the end, I started to realise I didn't need to force myself to try to sing in a deeper key just to conform. I've always wanted to eventually see them at a concert, they were the first band I avidly followed, but now I won't get that chance. \n\n\nRip, one of the most unique voices that has touched untold millions around the world.",

I guess in a way we grew up with them, even though we don't know them personally, they in some way, shape or form helped molded our life.

I'm still not sure I managed to do it completely under my own willpower, and I'd like to think that even if I'm down on myself, Someone upstairs is still looking out for me.",

I started singing the lyrics to myself and decided to wait until the song was done to cut myself. \n\nAt that moment, halfway through the song my dad knocked on the door. He never came to my cottage (in my parents' backyard). He came in and asked me if something was bothering me and that I should talk to them. He didn't know what I was about to do. So we sat and listened to the album as I talked to him.\n\nRIP Chester, and thanks for everything you meant to me.  ",

            "comment": "I was a 14 year old boy from Pakistan when I first listened to Hybrid Theory on cassette. I couldn't understand half of what they were saying, I couldn't understand any of the feelings they were trying to express. \"In the end\" was catchy as hell and so I persisted with the album. I would try to sing along and sing aloud, I would try to scream like Chester, I would try to rap like Mike. I'm now a 30 year old who lives in Atlanta, GA. I'm fluent in English only because I tried to impersonate Chester. His music is what I used as a springboard into American culture. This one hurts. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Whoa. I don't Reddit frequently so coming back to gold and all this love was unexpected. Thank you all for sharing your stories, this just goes to show that the human experience is so similar throughout. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven though it's coming very late, I'd like take this edit as an opportunity to showcase the struggles of keeping up with Linkin Park as a fan from the third world. My 56k dial-up internet was so bad that I had to download 96 kbps versions of MP3s because any larger file just wouldn't finish downloading. When I first found Kazaa, I would see all these \"New Linkin Park\" songs and after hours of downloading, it'd turn out to be Adema or Taproot or something. I fell for it over and over again. Back then you had to pay for internet by the hour, so imagine how thrilled my older sisters were when they found out that I used all of our internet hours trying to download the music video for 'In The End.' Thankfully it was the real deal and not one of those DBZ fan clips.",

I did a fucking class presentation in middle school on why the song structure of \"Breaking the Habit\" was unlike any other song ever made. LP was, and has remained a huge part of my life and the key factor in that is Chester's unbelievably good voice. A voice that was far and above better than anything in alt-rock/ metal at the time. I truly feel devastated, like I've lost part of my childhood. His poor family :(. Rest in peace man. You and Mike Shinoda changed the game forever.\n\n\nEdit: widened age range from 24-28 to 20-34. I in no way intended to upset anyone haha. My reason for picking that age range is because that is the one where Linkin Park could have literally been the first real music you were exposed to, as was the case for me :) \n\n\nEdit 2: Before one more person grills me about \"Breaking the Habit\" and schools me on standard song structure, I would like to point out that I was 11 years old at the time and had not been versed in such things. You missed my point entirely. The point was that I was such a huge fan that I was convinced no better music existed. I no longer feel that it is the most unique song ever made. I didn't know what I was talking about then because I was a small child, but what I knew was that I loved the band and that they had a significant impact on my music growth and development.

Hybrid Theory was the album that got me through my loneliness while I was homeschooled. I was the kid that always wore LP shirts and had LP posters plastered all over my wall. I shamelessly loved that band, and still do. Meteora was what got me through my parents divorce and kept me company during the fighting and screaming I heard down the hall when I was in middle school. \n\nLinkin Park had this beautiful ability to touch your soul in a way that when you walked around outside you would be in disbelief that the not everyone felt the fullness that you felt. \n\nSomewhere I Belong helped me stop cutting myself and made me feel like I wasn't alone. Linkin Park helped me and many others feel less alone and it kills me to think that's how Chester felt at the very end. I will be forever grateful. \n\nRIP Chester. ",

I was suicidal, I had a noose made, goodbye notes written; ready to go.  Around the same time, Linkin Park's 'A Thousand Suns' came out, featuring songs like 'Waiting For The End' and 'The Catalyst' that really spoke to me.  The inner booklet [described how the album was a study of human emotion, and how 'change is born in our most harrowing moments'](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YJM766qf5ps/TN68YEQwZ7I/AAAAAAAAMRM/8mE_31RQNI0/s1600/Booklet-2.jpg), and for the first time in a long time my perspective on my situation began to change.  It helped, not all the way, but it helped.  It made me reconsider what I was about to do, and for that, I am forever in debt to Linkin Park.  \n\nRIP Chester, thank you for the part you played in getting me through my darkest days.",

Just alittle bit of the \"you are not alone\", and \" it's okay to be frustrated\". (Most people around me have ridiculously smooth life And I indulged in guilt for being dissatisfied with life.)\nLinkin Park to me is almost a religion. My love to them is beyond just \"their music is good\". It is very spiritual. \n\nIt hurts so much to know the same music couldn't save the one who created it.... \n\nEdit: edit: I know these people very personally, grew up with them for 12 years, and back then they were only 10-15, and barely anyone had real-life issues back then. they all live in really happy, complete, upper-middle class families, with no other social circles since their life is so sheltered.\nHad to point that out after people was upset about me \"assuming others life\"... Which I totally understand as I always came out as the most cheerful girl people know, with rich parents and good grades, until people hear about my parental abuse and multiple cases of rape.",

I was only to have christian friends. I was to win at everything. A loss, to them, was only possible if I did not have faith in god and was therefore a wicked child who didn't try hard enough. If god could part the red sea, surely I could become the national champion in six different things at once. I became the state chess, debate and science fair champion, made it to all state in violin, and one tier below the professional orchestra at NEC. They didn't even go to my state debate champion awards ceremony. I remember standing alone outside waiting to be picked up while the second and even fifth place winners walked out with their happy parents. I cried, and when my father took me home he beat me for crying. I got straight As, I got a perfect score on the PSAT and a 2360 on the SAT. I took every single AP class at once and even took all of Harvard's undergraduate curriculum for biology while still in high school. It didn't matter. Nothing was ever good enough for them. Success wasn't to be rewarded. It was expected. The only time my father ever told me he was proud of me was when I got into caltech, which was immediately followed by his profound disappointment that I did not get into Harvard. I was only allowed to listen to classical music and was not allowed to hang out with other kids except christian kids and only on special occasions during christian potlucks. We only wore khaki pants and polo shirts, with the pants pulled up very high so we didn't look like \"gangsters with saggy jeans\". Dating was forbidden, and any sexual confusion was just ignored and treated like a mysterious evil curse. \n\nBecause my grandfather was both a pastor and military policeman with old ROC values, my father was just as strict and frugal. We had descended from the \"Dragon\" family line of generals stretching far back into history. We were to assemble at attention in a line instantly when called within 10 seconds or be beaten. No heat on the coldest nights and no air conditioning on the hottest days. Showers should only take 1 minute. We were not allowed to have food preferences. All food had been graciously provided by god, they said. He would buy clothes too big for us meant to last ten years. No TV. No celebrations on sinful american holidays. We were to forgo earthly needs, because \"man did not live on bread alone.\" Often, dinner consisted of a $1 hot dog wrapped in a kraft cheese single with one piece of white bread and a slice of lettuce. We ate rice gruel often. To this day I have a preference for super cheap food, like eating plain rice with just soy sauce and sesame oil. Because he didn't believe in women's rights or birth control, my mother kept having children. I had 4 other siblings. This made us very poor. Sometimes all we had to eat were saltines and condiments that we took from the free section of wendy's. We lived in a barn infested with bugs and were the poorest kids in town. I remember one time I asked my mother if we could give a friend a ride two blocks down and she screamed at me and then broke down in tears, saying we were running out of gas for the month and that my dad had to get to work. When things finally did get better, my dad said he would buy us an xbox if we could beat him in chess. When we beat him, he said instead that we had to win a tournament. When we finally got the console, he made us play The Bible Game on it, banned most violent games, and play DDR to exercise but only on songs that he approved of.\n\nBecause god had let the Israelites wander for 40 years as punishment until every person older than 18 died, my parents took that to mean that children weren't considered humans yet who could really make judgements they could be held accountable for. They basically thought we had no human rights of our own. My family made Tiger Mom look like Barney.\n\nBecause I had almost died when I was two months old to pneumonia, my parents had declared me a sacrifice to god, a Nazirite, if I were to survive. \"You are a priest forever, in the name of Melchizedek\", they told me. My life was not my own, because I had already died and this new life belonged to god. They named me Long Zhan in Chinese, meaning Dragon Warrior, and Genesis in english. I was to wear the armor of god and wage holy war against Satan. Ironically it basically meant my names were Genesis and Revelation, since revelation is often known as the dragon war. Which meant they named me Alpha and Omega, or god.\n\nOne day I stumbled upon a book in my father's study, where he kept his books from college. I read Nietzche's Beyond Good And Evil, thinking it was a christian book. When I finished reading it, everything changed. The things he said made too much sense for me to ignore.\n\nTHERE IS NO GOD kept flashing in my mind. I couldn't ignore it. I tried to force myself to believe in god and become christian again but it didn't work. I tried praying, but god wasn't there.\n\nI hid my new beliefs. I knew what would happen if my parents, who often told me that a wicked child should be stoned to death, found out. They often said they would rather kill me with their bare hands than raise an atheist.\n\nIt came to a head one day in middle school when I couldn't deal with a meaningless life anymore. I snuck away during worship and hid under a staircase, repeating to myself in shock \"what's the point?\"\n\nMy friend Katherine found me there. She understood. She was also dealing with hidden depression. We sat in our misery for hours. Before that moment, it seemed everyone was in paradise. That they were the dancing figures on the walls in Plato's cave that I was once a part of. It seemed all of them faced forward and that somehow I had looked backwards and found the void of nothingness behind their paradise that nobody else saw. But when I asked her what we could do, she didn't know how to answer either. We were blind leading the blind.\n\nToday I know this feeling isn't rare and that I wasn't alone. But because I was so isolated by christian rules, I didn't know of anything else in the world. I didn't know that the somber \"why bother\" of nihilism could be interpreted as the adventurous \"why not?\" I was an echo chamber of my own dark thoughts, with no-one to guide me. The only wise people were philosophers I read after Nietzche like Kant, and they were all dead. They couldn't talk to me. It was a long time before I would ever discover Nagel and Camus or the freedom of absurdism. Everyone I knew was christian. We had spent years shunning non-christians and the world outside my bubble was classified under a ubiquitous fog of war.\n\nWhen my father found me under the stairs he yelled at me for embarrassing him in the church and beat me when I got home. Slowly, they began to suspect that I was no longer christian. I remember making armor out of cardboard and wood in secret to protect against my father's blows. I remember making a runaway kit.  I remember running for my life up into the attic to keep my mother from killing me with a kitchen knife and calling the police while holding the door shut with my feet as she clawed at it. I remember fighting my father with a chair and cooking pot when he came for me with a metal bat.\n\nA friend of mine sent me the song Numb. I know that song saved me. It finally told me that someone else out there had dealt with this and come out with this beautiful song. It told me that the veneer of constant serenity of christianity I had forgotten I had even put up was a farce, that sometimes it was okay to be upset and mad and to punch a wall and let out all of these feelings instead of letting them eat me up. That it was preferable to feel anything, even bad things, instead of nothing, because then I valued the good more. The sonorific screams cut through my numbness.\n\nI remember sneaking up at 5am at night to play Morrowind to deal with stress while listening to Meteora on my cd player in secret and all the candy bars I had to sell at school to buy new batteries. I remember how when I entered portal temples Easier To Run would somehow always play as the sun rose outside my window, like it was telling me someday I would be free. To this day that song still pops up in my mind unbidden every time the sun rises. I listened to that CD player until it stopped spinning. I remember how I danced to Faint and went wild so I wouldn't be ignored anymore, how I longed for Somewhere I Belong and my heart soared when the ghostly echo of \"heal\" sounded. I remember being inspired to draw gothic art of monsters by Papercut, and how my mother poured oil on it and threw it in the trash. Years later when my sister took art lessons, I snuck something I drew to her teacher. He told me I had more talent than my sister did, said it to my mother's face. And my sister won the congressional national competition and her art is hanging in capitol hill. He made my sister use my other art pieces as the basis for her next few pieces, that I had given to my friend Annette in a folder so that it wouldn't be found in my house.\n\nToday, I'm a scientist and a breakdancer with zero signs of depression. I pushed through despite my parents not supporting my desire to be a biologist because they didn't believe in evolution, or thinking that breakdancing was just something that homeless black gangsters did while rolling around dirty floors. I taught myself bioinformatics in the kitchen, did research by hand that others did on computers or in the lab. I learned to do dangerous moves on concrete. Linkin Park saved my life. I have never cared for celebrity news before but somehow I am genuinely sad at Chester's passing because this man who saved me had no one to save him and I feel almost guilty.",

            "comment": "I met Linkin Park in early 2001, when their tour came to my town. My local radio station had a meet-&amp;-greet at a Blockbuster Music and barely anyone had heard of them. The rock station in town was **not** liked at all, in fact shut down in 2002 for being \"too vulgar\" playing heavy metal music, and not many people listened to it at all. \n\nAnyway, all of 10 people showed up to the meet-&amp;-greet at the record store. I remember seeing a young guy with green hair come out of an SUV and we didn't even know what Linkin Park looked like really. No one clapped, no one really noticed until they went in and sat down. They had their CD, Hybrid Theory up for sale for $4.99 and they would sign it for free. Didn't want to buy it, but the radio station gave me a license plate for them to sign.\n\nI got to talk to Chester at the event a little bit, and he seemed like a really nice guy and was SUPER excited to have even 10 people show up for him. He shook all of our hands and him and Mike Shinoda were really gracious guys - the whole band was really. They were still SUPER new and being on a nationwide tour with P.O.D. was just a lot for them to process. I'll never forget meeting them, I still remember it fondly 16 years later. I've always been a fan, I even bought their songs for Rock Band 3 and bought the keyboard that goes with so I could play the Pro Keys for it, which was somewhat like actually playing the song. \n\nRIP Chester.",

            "comment": "This is...really sad.  This post is kind of a mess because I was trying to find information about this show while I wrote it and I kept going back and adding information.  Sorry about that.\n\nSo, I met these guys right before the release of Hybrid Theory.  They were an opening act...\n\n...I can't think of who the headliner was though...Found it!  Looks like I was there to see Twiztid and Kottonmouth Kings - no wonder I couldn't really remember that part of the show.  I was going though a juggalo phase, think of that what you will.  Oh yeah, ReHab was there and at that time they were this corny rap group who actually had strippers that toured with them.  Same songs, but they sounded completely different.\n\nRight - they were opening that tour (I don't think anyone was there to see them, in fact) at a little club in Winston Salem, NC:  Ziggy's.  It's closed now but they used to have some amazing shows.  I saw acts from Hank Williams III to Deftones to Weezer to ICP there, it was a really kind of \"close\" space - just about anywhere you were, it felt like you could reach out and touch the people on stage.\n\n...or at least get fully doused in Faygo\n\nAnyway, their show - this would have been around mid-to-late 1999 (found it!  Looking through setlist.fm - it was September 18th, 2000) was just amazing, partly because of the venue but largely because of their performance.\n\nThere couldn't have been more than a couple of dozen people in the place for their show, but it was probably one of the tightest live performances I've *ever* seen - and I've helped run sound for acts like MDC, Jucifer, Skeleton Witch, and plenty of others - not to mention the shows I've attended as an audience member.\n\nThe guitar player wore headphones.  I've never seen anyone else do that.  The \"DJ\" didn't just do the record-scratching that it seemed all other rap-rock-metal-alternative-Bizkit-bands did around then.  He was live-sampling and mixing the levels of the other members on stage.  The synergy between them was on another level.  The live sound was pretty much album-quality, but it was right *there*...\n\nI told them as much after the show.  They were humble, gracious, and extremely nice.  I told them straight up:  You guys are going to be selling out arenas before too much longer.  I'm paraphrasing here, but Chester said something like \"that would be amazing, but I don't really think so.  We've been doing this kind of thing for a while now and we just love going around and playing for people who are into the music.\"  It seemed like they weren't thinking \"what does the radio want, how can we sell a hundred million records?\" - they were more like \"this is what we sound like when we do what we love, enjoy it with us.\n\nChester and Mike signed two demo tapes for me.  I've still got them.  Besides tshirts, posters, and other random merch that I've been given by bands who I've booked or done stage work for, I don't really have any other \"memorabilia\" - just those two tapes.  I stopped paying attention to them well over a decade ago.  I just wasn't into the sound anymore, to be honest - tastes change.  I still think the first record is brilliant, and the second record is pretty great too - those songs will always remind me of my early years in the Marines.  Someone was almost always blasting one of those CDs during field day.\n\nI mopped so many floors to those tracks.\n\nI wish he hadn't gone so soon.  He was full of music, and poetry.  Maybe it was a bit on-the-nose, a bit too much angst...too much anger, resentment, and other vague but passionate feelings towards an undefined \"you.\"  Some might say that's simplistic, formulaic - but it allows for the listener to place themselves in the narrative of the song, and recognize the things that they're feeling - and know by extension that they're not alone.  As an angsty young guy with too many hormones and too little life experience, it was very therapeutic sometimes to just turn the volume up and scream along.  I know I'm not alone in this either - I've seen you doing the same thing when I drive by you in traffic, don't try to deny it.\n\nIt's just a shame that the man who wrote those words couldn't find the same solace in them that they conveyed to so many others.\n\nI could close this out with almost any couple of lines from one of their songs, but I don't want to pick just one.  So go hit up YouTube, dig deep into your mp3 library, or even dust off an old CD and play a song or two for yourself...and enjoy the music.  That's what he told me was most important, and I think that's the kind of farewell he would have wanted.",

            "comment": "What's sad is Chester was lashing out at fans a couple months ago, because fans hated their new album for being over produced pop. He was angry at being called a sell out and was confrontational. He seemed genuinely angry and was lashing out constantly. A redditor below said that in recent shows, fans would throw bottles at them when they played their new singles.\n\nThen his best friend Chris Cornell dies, and it's his birthday today. I wonder if it was all too much for him. Since he took his life the same way Chris did, and on his birthday.\n\nAs someone that did not like their new album, I feel fuckin awful. I know I wasn't an asshole about it, and I have a right to be critical. But as someone that grew up with their music (Hybrid theory and Meteora were huge in middle school) - I can't help but feel awful.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI apologize if I opened up a debate about criticism. This is a touchy subject given Chester just died. But to be clear, I'm only talking about myself on a personal level in my post.\n\nI didn't mean to make others feel guilty for not liking an album. It's perfectly okay to not like art and to even be critical of it. I think we all know the difference between being critical - and being an asshole. Attacking him and yelling he's a sell out on twitter - because he made music you didn't like - that is not valid criticism. That is malicious. That isn't the same as not liking an album, and being critical.\n\nI'm sorry if I pushed this conversation into another direction. I've been crying non stop, and I can't help but feel a lot of emotions. I personally feel guilt - but it's not rational. It's just a personal thing I'm feeling. I didn't mean for others to feel that.\n\nI also wanted to say that, we fans (regardless if you hated some of their work) - should be supporting each other and not taking out our emotions on each other. At the end of the day, we all loved a piece of who they are. We all loved what Chester could create. It doesn't matter if we all don't love the same things.\n\n*hugs*\n\nI love you guys \n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\n",

I was living in podunk East Texas, didn't fit in, and had caught one of their songs on the satellite music channel...I played that album constantly - until Reanimation came out, and I played that instead. Within a couple of years, I had mostly moved away from that sound, but I've never lost an appreciation for LP. They play music that's easy to identify with and I love that they didn't stick to their original sound. I always felt a gratitude to them (Chester and Mike), for saying the things I felt. Thanks for your help, Chester, and for your voice. Rest in peace.",

Still...it's cathartic to write it.\n\nI'm a 51 year old woman, mother of 2 grown kids. 5 years of recovery, after 10 years of active alcohol and opiate addiction, which I am so far surviving. Music has always played a huge role in my life, but never more than when I was first in recovery. I listened to Linkin Park SO MUCH early on, because both the words and Chester's expression of them totally represented all the anger, confusion, conflict, hopelessness AND hope that I felt. Faint, Numb, Somewhere I Belong, Breaking the Habit, Crawling, Runaway...Oh, man. Knowing that he had his own battle with addiction is one of the things that made him so authentic. I will be forever grateful for the role he played/plays in my recovery. I wish him peace as he begins this next chapter of his journey. \n\nNamaste, brother.",

I listened to their music for hours on hours. I have each on of their tracks. Even the demos. Linkin Park helped me get through some rough times. I remember feeling so connected with Crawling, One Step Closer etc. For two straight years I listened to only Linkin Park. Yes it was kiddish, but it helped me through so much. I cant believe that I am crying. \n\nLP got me into music. The guitar I use is a PRS, because Brad used it. \n\nWhat really made LP different? I am going to say Chester. He poured his heart into singing. The guy has been thorough so much. Every single lyric he sang had some sort of angst, and he conveyed it so well.\n\nHas anyone heard of 'Breaking the Habit\"? Chester couldnt sing that song for a year after it was released because it was so personal. \n\nHe was my Idol. I never got too see LP live, but I will be youtubing every concert I can find.\n\nRIP Chester. You helped me, and so many of us get through the tough times, and we hope you are in a better place.",

They were playing a commercial for it on TV with clips of One Step Closer's music video. It was one of the first times I was really introduced to nu-metal that I liked and I remember being so excited about the album coming out. I bought it day one and listened to it over and over again. That blossomed into my adoration of all different genres of metal, which got me into playing musical instruments. Playing music gave me a greater respect for the talent that goes into ALL genres of music and really broadened my horizon for what I listen to. I don't know if that would have all happened without Linkin Park. Yet another sad day for music. My thoughts go out to his family.",

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom *Its* invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about the people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window, i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling 'Don't!' and 'Hang on!', can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\n\n-Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace",

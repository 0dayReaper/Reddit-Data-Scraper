And they know that the payments they set up will be feasible, but not affordable. It essentially gives the person a choice, pay for the car or drive the car. You can't really do both.

Placing a jumper on the motherboard to prevent booting to a crack disk and not placing tamper tape on the tower (at the very least) isn't terribly secure. \n\nNot to mention most admins gave their admin credentials to the comm guys so they could close their tickets for them.\n\nSource: I was one of those comm Marines caught in the middle, doing NMCIs job and getting yelled at by senior leaders used to having immediate support.",

There would have to be numerous safeguards, programs, and other measures to accomplish said rehabilitation. One would not be released unless those were satisfied. Therefore anyone continually deemed to be a threat to others would also continually be deemed in need of rehabilitation. Even if it is true that some are indeed beyond help it doesn\u2019t hurt us as a society to say \u201cwe choose not to give up on them regardless\u201d, as that process ideally also keeps them segregated from those they would otherwise harm.\n\nThe real kicker is that there will always be those who are able to expertly game such a system to satisfy whatever requirements for release exist",

It was a new car, and it was during my late twenties when I was trying to buy my first house. I kept getting impossibly low figures when I would seek a pre approval, even from other financial institutions. Like $120,000 in the mid 2010\u2019s. I lived and worked in a city where that is not enough.\n\nI gave up for years, as this mistake did not actually show on any credit report I would get. It didn\u2019t make sense. I eventually got angry enough to have it investigated. Once the second non-existent new vehicle was removed, still with a similar income, I was suddenly approved for $350,000. That was in 2020.\n\nFor years I thought I couldn\u2019t afford to buy a house in my home city, then when I realized NCFU had fucked my credit up and I COULD afford it that whole time, it was too late. The home prices had soared. They very directly cost me the chance to buy a house in my hometown when I had the opportunity.\n\nFuck NFCU, fuck this guy.",

Not only are there obvious safety benefits, but replacing at-grade junctions is one of the barriers to allowing higher speeds for trains since no crossings are permitted for 125mph trains",

They officially announced the underpass 20 years ago, and it took about 2 years of construction to do it. The overpass was finished about 8 years ago. Meanwhile, they've closed about 3 crossings between the downtown crossing to a mile and a half south east of there. Now , a two mile train can easily stop for hours and not need to be broken to prevent blocking tracks. Basically, the railroad uses those stretches as train parking lots. Likewise, between the downtown area there are two underpasses that have been there for generations. You have to go to the very northern point of the railyard before you see another crossing, but that's not the city's problem:those crossings are in another county.",

In a sense, they're not really very different from any other intersection, arguably safer if we're talking ones equipped with protection devices. Not like you have some big gate that closes to stop people from trying to run red lights at a normal intersection.\n\nJust like other intersections, some have circumstances where they're particularly dangerous or disruptive due to angles/sight lines, speeds, volume, etc and those are the ones that need alteration or elimination.\n\n-------\n\nBridges are expensive to build and expensive to maintain. It doesn't really make a lot of financial or safety sense to just go grade separate *every* rail crossing in the country. Money's not infinite and from just about every angle there would be better uses of that money if you had it available to spend on rail or on infrastructure in general. We certainly underfund infrastructure here, but even in the best funded places on the planet they probably wouldn't think that's a good use of funding.\n\n(to be clear, there are probably plenty more that *should* be eliminated than are just covered by these grants).",

The current project has 5 grade separated bridges. The cheapest of the 5 currently sits at $52.7 million using our current cost estimates. This is an extreme example, but it doesn\u2019t get all that much better. There\u2019s multiple reasons for the cost:\n\n1) You can\u2019t impact their (UPRR) operations so you actually have to build a temporary bridge parallel to the one you\u2019re reconstructing that will be torn down once the main bridge is reconstructed. So you have two build two bridges to replace one. This is called a shoofly bridge.\n\n2) Trains are heavy as fuck and require absolutely MASSIVE steel girders (7\u2019 - 10\u2019 tall, 200\u2019 - 300\u2019 length) to cross a freeway span without having to put a bridge substructure element in the middle of a lane. Steel is expensive as shit and you need specialized equipment to move those things.\n\n3) UPRR is absolutely the worst entity to work with. Ever. They have all the leverage in every negotiating situation and they know it. They own all the property and they don\u2019t give a shit about public safety like a DOT does. They will squeeze every last dime to get way more than they should and will gladly hold a project hostage to get what they want.\n\n4) Just want to reiterate that UPRR are a bunch of fucking ghouls and I fucking hate them with the fire of a thousand suns. They have made my life a living nightmare and I\u2019m on the verge of leaving our industry completely once this is completed.",

To eliminate a crossing the cars and the train need to go elsewhere/new bridging has to be engineered, designed, certified, built, road has to be repaved track has to be relain etc. and everyone involved has to eat. The locomotives themselves are worth millions a piece. At a dozens the price of each crossing elimination is well under $50M each, maybe well under 20. Depends on if we mean 2 dozen, 3 dozen, or several dozen.",

They just closed off  multiple crossings, and now neighborhoods are cut off from the rest of the city, with only 1-2 exits over the tracks.  Guess where they just announced they're having to do a major redo of an intersection - that's right, the main exit intersection.  They did move a switching yard out of the middle of the city, and built a bridge over the tracks so people on the east side of the city can get to the hospital without making a 10 mile detour -  but it took them about 15 years from the start of the bridge project to the end.",

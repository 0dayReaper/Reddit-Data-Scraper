[This is from 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eTzV7HvKHU) - note the first ten seconds.\n\nWhether the viewer sees the countdown depends on how quickly station master control switches to the network feed.

This is a plot twist I expected for so long, that I kind of stopped expecting it, so I actually am surprised it happened today, although I shouldn't be.  \n\n\nEdit: This got so many upvotes so fast. To reply to you tinfoil hat wearers. The timing does appear a little convenient. This is gonna cancel/postpone the debates, or make it so they are done over skype. However, I don't think Trump would fake a virus he will barely acknowledge exists. That move is too desperate. He isn't gonna play up the virus he failed to manage, a month before an election. Also, This is gonna cancel some of his key rallies. No president is gonna give up their ability to throw rallies for several weeks in October. I think he's really got it.",

Immediately, critical resources will be diverted to mitigate any outbreak at the most senior levels of government.\n\n\n&gt;Second, crisis mitigation will likely include quarantines. This means that key WH staff will not be able to fully perform their jobs, access classified servers, and more. We won't have a fully functioning team on the field.\n\n\n&gt; Trump's irresponsibility has put himself, his family, his staff, the functioning of our government, and millions of Americans at unnecessary risk.",

That makes it look like there aren't that many mass shootings, after all if four or more people are shot but all survive that mass shooting would not be tracked on the Mother Jones list. Heck, why not just make the definition of mass shootings as when more than ten people die no matter how many are shot? Moving the goalposts to that number would dramatically reduce the number of mass shootings in America. Mass **shootings**, hmmm, what does that phrase mean anyway?\n\nNo, you're just trying to downplay the violence in this country, violence primarily fueled by incredibly easy access to guns, particularly guns with large capacity clips, err, \"magazines\" as  you would no doubt correct me to, even though you'd still be wrong because it's actually \"detachable box magazine\". A Garand M-1 has a magazine, but it's not detachable, and is reloaded using clips.

After that you can request them to remove all personal data that is not critical and THEY MUST COMPLY. they also must give you all the data they have collected on you and the reason they collect it if you request it.\n\nCheers. I think the US has a similar data privacy law coming so for my fellow Americans, keep fighting for this kind of thing.\n\nEdit: as others pointed out, it is the 25th. Sorry for that. ",

                                    "comment": "So from my understanding, the precise methods are not yet known, as right now most companies operating in the EU are frantically preparing for when the GDPR arrives. The GDPR outlines what they have to provide, so I'd imagine the \"Who do we contact?, etc.\" will be the companies themselves (and if they don't comply, the authorities).\n\nI've found this website: UK Information Comissioner's Office. It explains the GDPR from a business standpoint (because it won't only affect the tech giants, but many (most?) EU companies). But here is the relevant section about [\"Individual rights\"](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/). Some highlights by me:\n\n**TLDR** (Too Long, Didn't Read):\n\n1. The right to be informed\n\n2. The right of access\n\n3. The right to rectification\n\n4. The right to erasure\n\n5. The right to restrict processing\n\n6. The right to data portability\n\n7. The right to object\n\n8. Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TSDU** (Too Short, Don't Understand):\n\n**1. Right to be informed**:\n\nYou have the right to know: the purpose of the collection of your personal data (*lawful basis*), retention periods and who will it be shared with. This must be provided *at the time* [so not later] they collect the personal data from you. If the company obtains personal data from *other sources*, it must provide you with privacy information within a reasonable period of time (max: 1 month). The info provided must be in plain language and easily accessible. \n\n---\n\n**2. Right of access**:\n\nThe purpose of this right is so you are \"aware of and can verify the lawfulness of the [company's data] processing [of you]\".\n\nYou have the right to obtain confirmation that your data is being processed, to obtain access to your personal data, to obtain other supplementary information (Article 15). The information must be provided to you *free of charge* (unless it's very excessive). The information have to be provided within a month.\n\nIn order to access your info, your identity must be verified by the company first using \"reasonable means\".\n\n---\n\n**3. Right to rectification**:\n\nYou are entitled to have personal data rectified if it is *inaccurate* or *incomplete.* The information have to be provided within a month. The company has to reply within a month (2, if it is a complex request).\n\n---\n\n**4. Right to erasure**:\n\nKnown as \"the right to be forgotten\". It is the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal data where *there is no compelling reason for its continued processing*. This means if: your personal data is no longer necessary for what it was originally collected, if you withdraw consent, etc.\n\nThe company can refuse erasure, to: exercise the right of freedom of expression; comply with legal obligations; public interest; scientific/historical/statistical purposes. \n\nChildren receive extra priority/protection \"*especially on social networking sites and internet forums*\", as \"a child may not have been fully aware of the risks involved in the processing at the time of consent\".\n\n---\n\n**5. Right to restrict processing**:\n\nYou have a right to block processing of personal data. When processing is restricted, the company can store the data, but not further process it.\n\n---\n\n**6. Right to data portability**:\n\nIt's the right to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. This enables consumers to take advantage of applications and services which can use this data to find them a better deal.\n\nThe company must provide the personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form. The information must be provided free of charge. Company must respond within a month. \n\n---\n\n**7. Right to object**:\n\nYou have the right to object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics (unless it's in the public interest). \n\nYou must be informed of this right to object \"at the point of first communication\". The company must stop processing personal data for direct marketing purposes as soon as it receives an objection.\n\n---\n\n**8. Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling**:\n\nCompanies must give you information about the automated processing, introduce simple ways for you *to request human intervention or challenge a decision*.\n\nThey must send you a link to their privacy statement when they have obtained your personal data indirectly. They have to tell who provides them with your personal data and your rights to objection. \n\n---\n\nThat's it in a nutshell. I recommend reading the full texts on the website and checking out the other categories. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBonus meme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_-KoBiBG0",

Anyway you could do that before under the current data protection guidelines.\n\nWhat is *more* useful, is you can do it for free, *and* you can ask what they hold on you that is not deleted.\nThink it is pushing the boundaries of \"business critical\"? Take them to court.\n\nIncidentally, for all people reading OC's comment - remember to exercise these rights as much and as far and as wide as possible. Getting spam mail for credit cards you don't need? Right to be forgotten request. A political party somehow got your details? Subject access request. Being spammed by a company? Well they better get their finger out, or the ICO will be crawling up their arse and slapping them with a 4% global turnover fine.\n\nGod this is going to be *fun*.",

That is info available to reddit and, unless you\u2019ve been actively sowing disinformation there(ie. Upvoting things you don\u2019t like, downvoting things you do like etc), it provides reddit with accurate info of your political, religious, societal etc beliefs. Your upvote/downvote history has info on your likes, dislikes, pet peeves, what movies you like, what kinds of sports appeal to you, what you find funny and unfunny, what you\u2019re not bothered by and what you\u2019re sensitive about, maybe your fetishes and sexual preferences... all sorted and organized by themed categories(subreddits).\n\nIf you use this site a lot, it\u2019d seriously create a terrifyingly accurate snapshot of your personality and thoughts. I don\u2019t think the tech to properly process this info exists yet, but reddit has the potential to be just as terrifying, if not even more so, in its data-gathering capabilities than other social networks.",

Credit history and personal data for commercial use is literally fantasy now as each individual's data is so compromised that its like using a dirty sock you found in the hospital dumpster as a condom then claiming its safe sex.  Later, another man gives that sock to a dog to chew on then throws it out only for another woman to find it and put it on her fist to anally fist her best friend.  At some point, Reebok or Nike finds this sock after many iterations and tries to repackage it into a bundle of other similar socks and calls it \"Personal Use\" socks.  ",

It really freaked me out.\n\nI've known people with violent exes who would literally be a danger to *everyone* if the guy got it in his head to show up at the bar we were at. Even if *you* aren't worried about posting everything for everyone to see, it's not cool to make all of your acquaintances vulnerable too. (I tried making this argument to her, but she insisted she didn't know anyone like that. She just assumed everyone else wanted to be online and would tell her otherwise.)\n\nShe was the kind of person Facebook loves because she'd tag people in photos and make references to other people all the time so she's one of those vectors who helps them gather info on non-users.",

Cool - but it only takes a few of your real life friends to not know or forget about how you're sticking it to the man and congratulating it on your actual birthday, or calling into question facebook saying it's your birthday, for an algorithm to see what's going on there and quietly keep what it thinks is your actual birthday and age on file but keeps displaying what you tried to tell it, because why not leave you in the illusion that facebook tinks you're really a 96 year old.\n\nNow if you wanted to make a mostly fake account - still with all the precautions to keep it separate from your real account - go ahead.. but unless you're really dedicated to effectively live two lives, that fake account is mostly just going to get ignored by facebook.\n\nYou're right, people think that just supplying some fake data is enough to poison the well, while in reality it's barely throwing a couple of leaves in that are easily scooped out.",

However I liked seeing all the random memory pictures from like 2007 that were still up, the posts I made back then on the other hand... not as much.  So I downloaded all the pictures onto my hard drive the other day in the move to delete my profile, will Facebook even delete it though?  Ive seen friends delete theirs only to come back in several months and see their pages basically completely reactivated.  If I want to hard remove everything I have uploaded onto their site how do I start?",

Its more of a Breach of Trust with Facebook, but the data was obtained legally through apps that people signed into, explicitly stating their information can be used, as well as through obvious methods like Surveys.

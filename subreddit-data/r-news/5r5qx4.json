Google, Microsoft, Starbucks, Ford, etc are all saying they disapprove. \n\nWe have Congress speaking out.\n\nEven fucking Republicans are speaking out against this bullshit. Trump will be the force that unites us. He will unwittingly make America Great Again by making us hyper active to #resist this. Our government can be much more if we make it so. I believe we can make it so. We have the will power and majority to make it so. We cannot lose. We cannot.\n\nTake a break when you need to. Take as long as you need. Then come back and renew your interest or at the very least donate to help those that will continue to #resist. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold stranger! I'm putting my money where my mouth is and donated to the ACLU.

Do you think the Attorney General has the responsibility to say no to the President if he asks for something that\u2019s improper? A lot of people have defended the [Loretta] Lynch nomination, for example, by saying, \u201cWell [Obama] appoints somebody who\u2019s going to execute his views. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d But if the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General say no?**\n\n**YATES: Senator, I believe the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution, and to give their independent legal advice to the president.**",

According to McCain / Graham's joint statement, they did not.\n\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/republicans-trump-muslim-ban\n\n&gt;Senators John McCain and Linsdey Graham, came under fire from the president\u2019s Twitter account on Saturday. \u201cIt is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d the senators said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nCNN also reported on this.\n\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban/index.html\n\n&gt;Before the President issued the order, the White House did not seek the legal guidance of the Office of Legal Counsel, the Justice Department office that interprets the law for the executive branch, according to a source familiar with the process.",

It's full on tinfoil but makes sense in my opinion:\n\nThe GOP didn't really have an electable candidate, but what they could do was exchange their support for a VP selection that represents everything they stand for and put him beside someone with a real chance. \n\nOnce he's elected they can just sit back and let him bury himself. If he doesn't misstep legally they can use their majority to declare him unfit for duty, and Pence takes over. Or they can simply pressure him to step down, allowing him to keep his pride but ending in the same result. \n\nAt that point we'd have a far right evangelical in office with a republican majority. The people (the majority of whom *didn't* elect Trump) are appeased, after all they have been calling for him to be impeached. But they don't realize they just got the greater of the two evils: a professional politician with capital to spend on the Hill and the backing of the religious right. \n\nIt's a perfect play if it's true. Pence has kept to the shadows this entire time, no one is talking about him. Most people I've talked to can't tell me the first thing about him. He's just Trumps VP. \n\nI hope it's not true.",

I'd rate they are presently doing a better job than Twitter or Facebook but only barely and with no signs of sustainability.\n\nUltimately the killer financing app that the internet really needs would be some way for as many users as possible to contribute funds with minimal financial friction (both user-convenience friction and per-transaction-fee friction) to help finance the publishing systems that said users access. I had high hopes that Flattr might approximate this for example, but I never saw that go anywhere. And Patreon appears to have cranked up the friction so much that $1/mo subscriptions get completely fee-captured so that creators don't see a dime of that.\n\nUltimately it still feels like something that grass roots group-negotiation might be able to have a hand in. Kind of like labor unions, but for journalism (et al) consumption. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Perhaps similarly for monetizing content creation.\n\nBut, corporate sponsorships of every stripe including referral links create the classic \"influencer\" conflict of interest that new content created (and shepherded via moderation) will optimize toward third party corporate profit and away from the needs of the reading and interacting public.\n\nFrom propagandizing substandard products and unhealthy practices (again, measured against the rubric of what the public might choose if *all* information were available including that which the promoter would prefer you not know) to diverting honest inquiries and discussions into product suggestions or \"rival\" product debates.\n\nIt may not be impossible *in principle* (and more often than not in a vacuum) for corporate sponsorship to fund a public platform w/o distorting it, but it does not scale against cut-throat global economic forces.\n\nWhat's in a healthy balance today will go out of balance tomorrow when new sponsors arrive, or after change in ownership of the platform, or the current sponsors, or greater success in the capitalist market by more toxic competitors to the current sponsors.\n\nWhile advertising, referrals, and corporate sponsorships in general do involve the platform consumers financing the platform themselves, I think that the fact that they do so through the proxy of \"buying products\" is what leads to toxic outcomes.\n\nThe products the platform actually needs to be able to \"sell\" are the direct services that the platform makes available to the public: content, discussion, journalism, etc.\n\nUnfortunately the price-per-subscriber-per-platform is too low to account for easily, so I'd like to see something more like where a user pays one clearinghouse (ideally owned by users in aggregate as a non-profit) to pay many platforms on their behalf. Then the price per-user-*to-many-platforms* would be high enough to be more manageable through the global payment network (less per-transaction fees and user inconvenience) and not only could platforms and creators get payment from centralized clearinghouses instead of millions of individuals, but group negotiation could ensure that the end user's needs get properly recognized as well.",

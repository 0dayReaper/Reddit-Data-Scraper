Three apartment buildings were blown up killing hundreds, but soon after a fourth bomb was discovered by a block's residents, the bomb squad verified the explosive was chemically identical to the other three explosions, and residents and the police were congratulated for foiling an attempt... **Until 3 days later**, when the people who planted the bomb were discovered and arrested and **found out to be Russian secret service agents**, after which all talk about the foiled attempt became a sudden discussion about \"the successful training exercise\". There were no explosives in the basement, *just bags of flour... (that field-tested positive for military grade explosive)*\n\nThere's so much evidence tying Putin to the attack, you can drive straight line to him from the FSB agents that planted it, but in Russia it's forbidden to discuss and the people who lived in the apartment building refuse to talk about it in fear that \"they might actually blow us up next time.\"",

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early. Putin was elected president and his first act was to guarantee Yeltsin immunity from prosecution.\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings)",

Everyone in power is transactional in their dealings (\"I can do this for you, but what can you do for me?\"). The current power structure is similar to that of a crime organization, where the head guy has a bunch of yes men around him to back them up, and they're enriched by the head guy because of this. But they have to keep being yes men because if they aren't, he could take everything they have in an instant. The police are aused like hit squads, and they even use false flag tactics and messaging that mirrors organized crime almost to a T.",

Separatists trying to until a major faction \"defected\" to Russia in the 2nd Chechen war.\n\nIt's what happened in Georgia after it declared independence from the USSR. Russia backed separatists until they \"justified\" invasion in 2008 and now two \"breakaway\" regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are only recognized as independent countries by Russia and its allies.\n\n\nAnd we all know about Donbass, Luhansk, Crimea and Ukraine.",

This works because people generally keep their money in banks and maintain some balance.  Since not everyone needs all their money at the same time, the bank just needs to keep enough on hand to satisfy day to day business.  Also, since the bank actually gets value out of holding regular deposits, banking is relatively cheap (generally free for retail banking).\n\nIf you eliminate fractional reserve banking, banks can only lend secured deposits, that is deposits that can't be withdrawn until the term is up, like CDs   That leads to a drastic drop in liquidity.  The only way for banks to lend money is to lock up the money in a security that prevents withdrawal.  That would greatly increase the cost of lending.  Basically really high interest rates.  Additionally, banks get no value out of holding liquid deposits for retail customers, so the general consumer would have to pay for banking.",

That's about 400 years of average Russian salary.\n\nI know a general or whatever probably makes a lot more. But a million dollars is a lot, especially now.\n\nEdit: Seems like a Russian military officer was making about 50k USD before the war. So that's about 72 years pay for them now.",

Many fell into disrepair by the 1980's and 1990's, but with increasing salaries with the 2000s increase in oil prices, many have been able to refurbish their apartments, build homes out in the country, live relatively nice middle-class lives.   My family has multiple apartments that they've lived in for decades and one that they purchased following the USSR collapse and I feel safe and comfortable when I visit them.   Hot water, electricity, gas, all reliable.  We also have dachas out in the country and my uncle has slowly but surely built a REALLY nice house on his property, it looks like it's worth a ton of money but he just spent a lot of time and effort to gradually build it up over 30 years and it's a great place to visit.\n\nThis is just my experience as an \u00e9migr\u00e9 to the USA and I understand many other Russians aren't as fortunate as my family and live in what are essentially hovels that haven't been improved since the 1970's.  Different people live differently.   From my perspective, though, I've always loved visiting Russia: it was always a glimpse into what my life may have been like if I stayed.   I know my uncles and aunts worked very hard for what they've earned, it wasn't given to them, they had to grind away for years through some very turbulent times, this week/past few years included.",

I'll be trying to call them a little more often; I usually call them once a month or every other month and I am definitely going to step it up now.   I should've stepped it up a long while ago.   Last time I visited was 2018.   Fucking CoViD is \"nearly over\" and then this happens.   I would have loved to visit sometime soon &amp; now I will have to wait quite a long while.",

The idea that the oligarchs are the secret power in Russia is an out of date concept that dates from the Yeltsin years, as well as the Western perspective that money grants power.  Putin cowed them with a campaign of seizures, prosecutions and outright murder, based on his assertion that power derives from the willingness and ability to use force.  These days, it's the military and security chiefs that form Putin's constituency.  The oligarchs aren't a worry for him, it's his subordinate and allied warlords.  If people start rioting in the streets and he can't get a police or army unit to crack their skulls, that's when he'll be in trouble.  A gangster soccer team owner isn't going to make him lose sleep.",

Ruble to USD dropped to .028 in 2009, .014 in 2015 (Crimea invasion), and .0094 today.  While the sanctions are great Putin has been angering governments and financial institutions around the world since at least 2014.  The graph over time clearly indicates Putin's leadership has done nothing but hurt the Russian economy.  It makes me wonder if these sanctions really matter that much to the regime since it's happened before and they adapt. (Note while the graph fluctuates the Ruble exchange rate has never even come close to returning to the pre 2008 value of .035).",

Imagine if this happens and it starts a whole trend of untraceable decentralized crypto bounties on all sorts of public figures. Every politician and CEO would have crowdsourced bounties. Countries would secretly contribute to bounties of the heads of state of their rival countries. You'd also end up with professional bounty hunters who travel the world taking out high profile targets\n\nSoon ordinary people will start using it too. People would put a small bounty on their ex after a breakup. You may secretly contribute $5 to someone's bounty after they're rude to you. If you're a minority in a racist white town all your racist neighbors upset about you moving in will secretly drive your bounty up. Anytime a \"Karen\" goes viral on social media their bounty increases by a million\n\nOfficially, these bounties will be illegal and there will be a lot of public opposition to them. In private, plenty of people will secretly use them, even those that are vocal for their abolishment",

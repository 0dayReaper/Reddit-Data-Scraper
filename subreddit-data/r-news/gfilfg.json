Back in the heyday of lynching - up to the 1910s - people took photos, faces all visible, to celebrate lynchings. They didn't try to hide. We know what went on because they were proud of it.\n\nThis is the era where Ida B Wells operated, after friends of hers were lynched, and her printing press was attacked and vandalised. Her crusade got a lot of attention.\n\nEven with all that evidence, Congress failed to pass anti-lynching legislation for decades.\n\nFoe the modern day, I remember Rodney King. Everyone was saying, this wasn't unusual, it was just unusual it was caught on tape.\n\nAnd now there's hard evidence. But this era of ignorance, of not knowing what happened, its brief. We kidded ourselves into thinking it was in the past.\n\n(Of course, by \"we\" I mean white people. Black people always knew.)",

One of the guys that chased after the kid. \n\nWhich kind of makes me think that he's just pretending to be dense, saying \"I released it to exonerate us! It shows that what we did was justified.\" When in reality hes just trying to get himself clear of this whole thing. Because from the start, the headlines were \"Three men chased and attacked AA\", but in the video we see Guy 3 wasnt actually there until the other 2 had murdered him. So maybe he's trying to get his name clear by releasing the video. Even I, when I first started hearing about this, was like \"All 3 need to have the book thrown at them regardless who pulled the trigger\", but when you see the video... regardless of the fact he's still a piece of shit who intended to participate in it, he didnt actually get there until after the murder. So if it is true he released it, the only thing that makes sense is he's basically flipping on his buddies to get public pressure off him, and playing stupid by saying he released it because he thought it exonerated them. Because nobody with functioning eyeballs and a brain looks at that video and says \"Yep. Totally justified. Those 2 were clearly the victims here\"",

Unsolved murder and \"random\" is how the authorities put it.  We believe he was targeted (he was a dark skinned Latino who was in college, no criminal record) and they basically just ran him off the road and riddled his car with bullets. Cold case. No closure. \n\nI wouldn't be shocked if this isn't the first time either of these guys have murdered a black or brown person.",

Improvement takes work, but people here have been putting in the work. \n\nIt was clear to me that the GBI knew what was up the minute I read their first press release, which pointedly noted that the Glynn County PD wasn't asking them to investigate the actual crime, but instead how the tape leaked. That's old-school cop shade.\n\nThere are racists who will weigh in here, of course. The line they're taking is that Arbery must have been doing something wrong, because he has a criminal history, or mental illness, and had the temerity to be in a white neighborhood (unescorted, no less), far from home. \n\nSet aside, for a moment, the absurdity of challenging someone with a shotgun because of a superficial resemblance to a black guy they claim had been on camera burglarizing a home. One would have to believe that Arbery was returning to the same neighborhood far from his own home to commit even more crimes there instead of simply going somewhere else. The suggestion is calcified stupidity. \n\n\"But he looked like the guy!\" How? \"Well ... he's black!\"\n\nThis case has the potential to definitively end citizens arrest as a justification for violence. I'm eagerly awaiting how that plays out.",

But what about that jaywalking ticket he got in 2009 and that one Facebook photo probably out there somewhere of him with an alleged person who may have taken drugs once. \n\nThat tooootally makes murder all okay and stuff.\n\nEdit to add: instead of replying to all the clowns out there claiming self defense (just like George Zimmerman). It's not self defense if you CHOSE to put yourself in that situation. They are literally standing on the back of a truck and next to an open driver side door. They could drive away. That would be acting in self defense. \n\nSo even if you were going to try and use that bullshit excuse, it's still meaningless. They CHOSE to go hunting for him. They CHOSE to confront him. And they CHOSE not to leave once it escalated. \n\nThe case against the self defense case is simple. \"Could you have walked/driven away?\" \"Yes\". Case closed. \n\nYou don't get to go hunting for people you think committed a crime. You don't get to be judge, jury and executioner. That makes you a murderer. These guys chose to be murderers.\n\nEdit to add again:\n\n[Here is a link to the stand your ground (self defense) law in Georgia](https://codes.findlaw.com/ga/title-16-crimes-and-offenses/ga-code-sect-16-3-21.html)\n\nHere are some notable points on why that just simply isn't the case at all here:\n\n&gt;(b)\u2002A person is not justified in using force under the circumstances specified in subsection (a) of this Code section if he:\n\n&gt;-(1)\u2002Initially provokes the use of force against himself with the intent to use such force as an excuse to inflict bodily harm upon the assailant;\n\n&gt;-(3)\u2002Was the aggressor or was engaged in a combat by agreement unless he withdraws from the encounter and effectively communicates to such other person his intent to do so and the other, notwithstanding, continues or threatens to continue the use of unlawful force.\n\n&gt;(d)\u2002In a prosecution for murder or manslaughter, if a defendant raises as a defense a justification provided by subsection (a) of this Code section, the defendant, in order to establish the defendant's reasonable belief that the use of force or deadly force was immediately necessary, may be permitted to offer:\n\n&gt;-(1)\u2002Relevant evidence that the defendant had been the victim of acts of family violence or child abuse committed by the deceased, as such acts are described in\u00a0Code Sections 19-13-1 and\u00a019-15-1, respectively; and\n\n&gt;-(2)\u2002Relevant expert testimony regarding the condition of the mind of the defendant at the time of the offense, including those relevant facts and circumstances relating to the family violence or child abuse that are the bases of the expert's opinion.\n\nAs you can see. Literally none of that applies to this case. It also flat out explicitly states why it can't be used in certain circumstances. Almost all of which unsurprisingly apply here. There was no family acts of violence or child abuse here. They were the aggressor.",

They could have safely stayed were they were, or driven away, instead of chasing him down and cornering him, assaulting him by brandishing a weapon. \n\nMaybe they did fear for their life already. It's still not self defense (and sure as shit wouldn't be a rational fear). They initiated aggression, so it is their victim who has the right to defend himself.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m adding the analysis of Georgia law by a Georgia Lawyer friend of mine who handles a lot of these types of cases.\n\nFeel free to share this to help show how the law was designed to work in cases of shooting unarmed people. \n\nA black man (Arbery) was shot in broad daylight while jogging in his own neighborhood.  The 911 calls have the operator asking the shooter what Arbery was doing that was of criminal concern. They didn't give any answer for that, they said, 'He's a black man running down our road.\u201d  The DA later determined that the men were conducting an armed citizens arrest of a black man who fit the description of a man that committed robberies at some unspecified time and place in the past.  \n\nNo charges filed.  \n\nThe murder of Ahmaud Arbery raises questions of self defense and mutual combat in Georgia and whether the DA properly exercised discretion in not charging the men making a \u201ccitizens arrest.\u201d  Fortunately, the Supreme Court of Georgia has already resolved this for us and the men should be charged with murder.  Here\u2019s why:\n\nTo lawfully use deadly force, an individual must reasonably believe \u201cthat such force is \nnecessary to prevent death or great bodily injury to himself or herself or a third person or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-3-21(a). If a party knowingly uses deadly force on an unarmed individual, they are not entitled to a justification defense:\n\n\u201cYet, the record shows that Milton moved toward Brunson only because Brunson had threatened Milton with a revolver. Both eyewitnesses testified that Milton grabbed the arm of the hand holding the gun and pointed it away from anyone. No witness testified that Milton had a gun, and police found no other weapon, shell casings, or bullet holes at the crime scene. The fact that Milton was a large man is insufficient to support a finding that Brunson had a reasonable belief that he had to shoot Milton to avoid death or great bodily injury to himself. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that the evidence did not warrant the giving of a self-defense charge.\u201d  Brunson v. State, 293 Ga. 226, 227\u201328, 744 S.E.2d 695, 697 (2013). \n\nAs stated by the Georgia Supreme Court and the Georgia Court of Appeals, \u201c[m]utual combat usually arises when both parties are armed with deadly weapons and mutually agree or intend to fight with them.\u201d Martin v. State, 258 Ga. 300, 301, 368 S.E.2d 515, 516 (1988).  It has been repeatedly held that the defense of mutual combat does not apply to a fist fight, or a scuffle:\n\nMutual combat does not mean a mere fist fight or scuffle. \u201cThere was no evidence that they mutually agreed or intended to fight with deadly weapons. The requested charge [of mutual combat] was not warranted by the evidence and the trial court did not err in refusing to give it.\u201d Martin, 258 Ga. at 301; see also Stewart v. State, 257 Ga. 211, 213, 356 S.E.2d 515, 516\u201317 (1987); Stewart v. State, 257 Ga. 211, 213, 356 S.E.2d 515, 516\u201317 (1987) (\u201cThe evidence in this case did not warrant a charge on mutual combat, as there was no evidence that the victim was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the fight\u2026.\u201d); Andrews v. State, 254 Ga. 498, 499, 330 S.E.2d 873, 875 (1985) (\u201cThere is no evidence that the victim in this case was armed with a deadly weapon nor that the victim agreed to fight.\u201c)",

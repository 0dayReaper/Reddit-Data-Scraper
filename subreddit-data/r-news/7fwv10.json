Bob Mercer has certainly embraced the view that radiation could be good for human health - low level radiation.\n\n&gt;Among other things, Mercer said the United States went in the wrong direction after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and also insisted the only remaining racists in the United States were African-Americans\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/05/26/530181660/robert-mercer-is-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with-in-finance-and-conservative-politic\n\nSteve Bannon on getting \"rootless white males\" \"radicalized\":\n\n&gt;the power of what he called \u201crootless white males\u201d who spend all their time online.\n\n&gt;And five years later when Bannon wound up at Breitbart, he resolved to try and attract those people over to Breitbart because he thought they could be radicalized in a kind of populist, nationalist way. And the way that Bannon did that, the bridge between the angry abusive gamers and Breitbart and Pepe was Milo Yiannopoulous, who Bannon discovered and hired to be Breitbart\u2019s tech editor.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/steve-bannon-white-gamers-seinfeld-joshua-green-donald-trump-devils-bargain-sarah-palin-world-warcraft-gamergate-2017-7\n\n&gt;\"I realized Milo could connect with these kids right away,\" Bannon told Green. \"You can activate that army.

It reads: \u201cPeople are lazy. With television you just sit\u2014watch\u2014listen. The thinking is done for you.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/richard-nixon-and-roger-ailes-1970s-plan-to-put-the-gop-on-tv/2011/07/01/AG1W7XtH_blog.html\n\n&gt;Daily memos\n\n&gt;Photocopied memos instructed the network's on-air anchors and reporters to use positive language when discussing pro-life viewpoints, the Iraq War, and tax cuts, as well as requesting that the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal be put in context with the other violence in the area.[84] \"The soldiers [seen on Fox in Iraq] in the foreground should be identified as 'sharpshooters,' not 'snipers,' which carries a negative connotation.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies#Internal_memos_and_e-mail\n\n[How Roger Ailes Built the Fox News Fear Factory: The onetime Nixon operative has created the most profitable propaganda machine in history](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-roger-ailes-built-the-fox-news-fear-factory-20110525)\n\n&gt;Ailes repackaged Richard Nixon for television in 1968, papered over Ronald Reagan\u2019s budding Alzheimer\u2019s in 1984, shamelessly stoked racial fears to elect George H.W. Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993.\n\n&gt;\"He was the premier guy in the business,\" says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. \"He was our Michelangelo.\"\n\n&gt;Over the next decade, drawing on the tactics he honed working for Nixon, he helped elect two more conservative presidents, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. At the time, Reagan was beginning to exhibit what his son Ron now describes as early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s, and his age and acuity were becoming a central issue in the campaign.\n\n&gt;But in 1993 Ailes inked a secret deal with tobacco giants Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to go full-force after the Clinton administration on its central policy objective: health care reform.\n\n&gt;Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting \u201creal people affected by taxes.\u201d\n\n&gt;According to internal memos, Ailes also explored how Philip Morris could create a phony front group called the \u201cCoalition for Fair Funding of Health Care\u201d to deploy the same kind of \u201cindependent\u201d ads that produced Willie Horton. In a precursor to the modern Tea Party, Ailes conspired with the tobacco companies to unleash angry phone calls on Congress \u2013 cold-calling smokers and patching them through to the switchboards on Capitol Hill \u2013 and to gin up the appearance of a grassroots uprising, busing 17,000 tobacco employees to the White House for a mass demonstration. \u201cRJR has trained 200 people to call in to shows,\u201d a March 1993 memo revealed. \u201cA packet has gone to Limbaugh.

Only a few days before Trump\u2019s Inauguration and The Review\u2019s anniversary event, Thiel attended the pro-Trump and heavily alt-right-attended \u201cDeploraball,\u201d which had been in part organized by Jeff Giesea \u201997, a former Review editor-in-chief who once worked at Thiel Capital Management.\n\n&gt;In Oct. 2016, shortly after Thiel donated $1.25 million to Trump, Thiel publicly apologized for passages in his 1995 book The Diversity Myth, such as claiming that some alleged date rapes were \u201cseductions that are later regretted,\u201d ... But three months later, during the after party of the 30-year anniversary event at Thiel\u2019s home, according to a former editor, Thiel stated that his apology was just for the media, and that \u201csometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear.\u201d\n\nhttps://stanfordpolitics.org/2017/11/27/peter-thiel-cover-story/\n\nAnother area where Republican voters get so easily played by billionaires using \"God, guns, gays\" and racism to get less regulation and avoid paying their taxes:\n\n&gt;Exhibit 13: 10% fewer Republicans believed the wealthy weren't paying enough in taxes once a billionaire became their president.

Overpowered and monopolized telecom service in America needs to be a much bigger political topic than it is.\n\nBut, honestly, Net Neutrality is the *least* of what our government should be doing to the ISPs, and we can barely get the average person to give a shit about that.\n\nAmericans as a whole have just not paid attention to this issue and they let it grow and grow and grow.

Streaming is the future and the tech now shows that 25mbs is a minimum not a high end level anymore. 15x3 tvs on 4k Netflix is 45mbps, then phones, computers.

Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.\n\nAlso there is a March on DC at https://www.reddit.com/r/marchfornetneutrality\n\nWHAT\u2019S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see &amp; do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nWHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\nWHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\nHOW CAN I JOIN? Click here http://www.verizonprotests.com/ and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one, and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.\n\n",

All of us citizens are like a giant oil pocket in the ground, and the government is on the side of the corporations, passing laws and slowly sacrificing our freedom to extract as much money from us as possible. We are only as useful as the money in our pockets, and unless you have a government contract where you do something to benefit the machine, you too will be mined, extracted, processed and excreted.

            "comment": "Though it once represented American ideals and stood to promote freedom of communication, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has strayed from its original mission and acts against both its own mission and the interests of the American people.\n\nFounded in in 1934, the FCC\u2019s mission was to \u201cmake available so far as possible, to all people of the United States\u2026 rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio communication services *with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.*\u201d (Emphasis mine.)\n\nThis is a goal worthy of and necessary to any democracy - to ensure equal access to the best information and communication technologies available. Democracies live and die by the quality of accessible information and understanding of current issues: illiterate and ill-informed voters make illiterate and ill-informed decisions, often voting against public interests because they are ill-informed, allowing outside influences to slowly disintegrate the very freedoms inherent in a democracy. Ensuring fair access to accurate information is a critical part of ensuring the survival of a democracy.\n\nHowever, since the removal of several regulations in the 1980s to make it more \u201cmarket-oriented\u201d, the FCC has gradually, systematically, and dangerously veered away from its mission to ensure equal access to reliable information. It has deeply wounded American democracy in the process, and seeks to wound it mortally.\n\nThe FCC was originally bound by a number of regulations - among them, The Fairness Doctrine of 1949. The Fairness Doctrine required television broadcasters, radio stations, and cable providers to both inform the public about important issues, and to do so in an honest, equitable, and balanced way - to expose viewers to opposing viewpoints in a reasonable and truthful manner. The FCC\u2019s enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine is responsible for Americans\u2019 trust of broadcast and television news. Legally obligating broadcasting license holders to both present critical issues to Americans and to do so in a way that accurately reflected reality ensured that citizens could reasonably expect that they were getting an accurate representation of a given issue when they watched the news. Consumers had no need to seek multiple sources, since those multiple sources would essentially be hitting the same notes on the same issues. Consumers could trust that broadcast networks were accurate, reliable, honest sources of information.\n\nThe Doctrine\u2019s removal, and the FCC\u2019s subsequent lack of responsibility to uphold broadcast standards, has destroyed the quality broadcasts that built trust in those institutions.\n\nWhen the Fairness Doctrine was effectively eliminated in 1987, and officially eliminated from law in 2011, the FCC was no longer obligated to issue fines to broadcast networks who intentionally represented facts in untruthful or misleading ways. When the Doctrine was eliminated, the FCC was no longer expected to uphold the high standard of communication that had built the American public\u2019s confidence and trust in broadcast networks. \n\nThe FCC\u2019s failure to enforce communication standards since the 1980s has allowed market pressures to contaminate the quality of news broadcasts. Moreover, broadcast networks became incentivized to ensure that they had the largest audience possible, by any means necessary. As a result, broadcast news networks have become more partisan, more extreme, more reactionary, and focus on their own agendas rather than public interest. This is demonstrated by the razor-sharp partisan divides exhibited by viewership at each of the major broadcast news stations, and the fervor with which those news stations present issues in ways that support their own avaricious agendas rather than the best interests of the American people.\n\nThe FCC ceased to regulate broadcast media against market pressures, and in return, broadcast news has been corrupted by those market pressures.\n\nWithout FCC enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine, TV news networks are now allowed to present current events with whatever partisan or corporate slant they deem most self-serving. They are allowed to misrepresent fact using both misleading \u201cexperts\u201d on two sides of uncontroversial issues, and one-sided presentations of controversial issues. They are allowed to not report on momentous news regarding American democracy, and instead discuss sensationalist accounts of news for the sole purpose of securing larger crowds of viewers. They are allowed to lie to their viewers in all but letter, and all in the name of profit for the companies that own them.\n\nThe FCC stood passively by and allowed broadcast networks to be corrupted by greed.\n\nBut now, the FCC is ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING corporate interests to corrupt the internet.\n\nIn December 2017, the Chairman of the FCC will hold a vote to overturn the principle of net neutrality. Net neutrality requires that all information be treated equally by internet service providers. In other words, net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging different amounts of money based on the websites a customer visits, the same way that an electric company can\u2019t charge a different rate for the electricity to power a microwave than they charge to power a light bulb.\n\nNet neutrality prevents ISPs from charging extra fees to visit certain websites. It prevents ISPs from slowing a customer\u2019s internet connection because the customer is using the services of the ISP\u2019s competitor. Net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging content providers (such as YouTube, Netflix, The New York Times, and IGN) exorbitant fees to ensure that their content is viewable in the \u201cfast lane\u201d. It prevents ISPs from blocking websites based on the consumer\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge fees for any imaginable reason.\n\nSince net neutrality is the existing paradigm, it may be difficult to imagine a world where fees are ubiquitous to internet use. Under net neutrality, you pay your monthly subscription fee for internet service. You connect to the internet, and can access anything you find without the ISP charging additional fees based on what you access.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge an extra fee unless you used their brand of modem. They could charge more to access certain websites, or offer subscriptions to the services that they own, so that you don\u2019t have to pay additional fees whenever you wanted to access their service. They could squash their competition by forcing content providers to pay exorbitant fees to be offered to the ISP\u2019s customers, preventing the growth of non-ISP businesses into the ISP\u2019s markets. ISPs could write clauses into their service contracts that terminate your service if you visit certain websites, charging exorbitant fees to reinstate your service.\n\nWithout net neutrality, there is no oversight for what ISPs can and can\u2019t charge for. \n\nThe FCC is not only standing aside to let net neutrality be dissolved, but are actively encouraging its dissolution.\n\nIn December, the FCC will hold a vote to to take away our equal access to information, and give that power to the ISPs themselves. If the FCC gives ISPs control over what they provide and what they don\u2019t, they will lay the foundation for an America where ISPs control all access to information - holding it hostage until consumers pay whatever price they assign.\n\nIf that\u2019s a world where you want to live, sit by and do nothing. The FCC will happily assure you that they have your best interests at heart - as they allow ISPs to line their pockets by selling you your freedom.\n\nBut if you believe that ISPs have no business increasing their profit margins by taking away your freedoms, call your Senators and Congressmen. Remind them that American democracy relies on fair access to information - and without equal access to the internet, there can be no fair access to information.\n\nRemind your legislators the FCC is voting to let ISPs ransom freedoms from the people your legislators were elected to serve and represent.\n\nRemind your legislators that the FCC exists to protect Americans\u2019 access to information - not to sell it to the highest bidder.\n\nRemind your legislators to prevent the FCC from overturning net neutrality now - because you might not be able to tell them afterwards.\n\nMore info:\nThe Fairness Doctrine - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine\n\nThe FCC's History and Mission - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission#Mission_and_strategy\n\nThe Best-Case Scenario If Net Neutrality Is Overturned - Portugal - http://www.businessinsider.com/net-neutrality-portugal-how-american-internet-could-look-fcc-2017-11\n\nWhat Happens When Net Neutrality Is Overturned - The Loss of Business and Consumer Protections, and Reliance on ISPs to Be Trustworthy - https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/what-happens-once-net-neutrality-rules-bite-the-dust/2017/11/22/d8a50bf2-cfe8-11e7-a87b-47f14b73162a_story.html?utm_term=.552e10266101\n\nReach out to your legislators:\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/contact\nhttp://gofccyourself.com\nhttps://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\nhttps://www.house.gov/representatives\n\nTwitter:\n@realDonaldTrump\n@AjitPaiFCC\n@MClyburnFCC\n@mikeofcc",

Then they just kick back most of the fee to the big content guys.  Basically netflix pays a comcast to artificially increase their arbitrary fee in order to keep competition to a minimum.  Then comcast refunds a portion or some other sneaky method.  \n\nThey may even pay for exclusive rights.  This is not necessarily fast lane but similar.  Imagine if walmart paid comcast a few billion for exclusive online retail rights!  Since comcast can block traffic now at will.  This would mean the only online store that you can use is walmart.comcast.  Amazon would be blocked.  This walmart will feel a need to worry about amazons lower prices then?  \n\nAnd before you say \"time to get a vpn\" please tell me what you think it is do for you?  They might even straight up block vpns.  A vpn might allow you to access amazon in this scenario but it will not make your youtube go any faster.  Again, they will quickly start blocking vpns.  But dont worry, comcast will offer their own vpn service and some idiot will actually pay for it.  ",

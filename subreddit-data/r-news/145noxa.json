Every once in a while you hear a different scream pop out of the crowd- a pain scream- and it always gets my attention if I'm outside. I'm not a mother, but I still have an instinct of \"uh oh, is that kid ok?\" And I take a look to make sure someone is tending to them, and there isn't anyone screaming for 911 to be called,  before I go back to gardening or whatever I was doing. I can't fathom just standing by when you know kids are being murdered, you can hear it happening. Especially if you're the ones who are supposed to respond to the situation, and have the weapons/training (supposedly) to do so effectively. Anyone who could do that is a monster, imo.",

Refused to explain things a different way, \u201cif you don\u2019t get it you just aren\u2019t cut out for this\u201d. Mind you I was 10, with zero guitar experience. It\u2019s like he expected his students to immediately be savants just due to his presence. \n\nI did 2 lessons and never touched ANY instruments again. I was in choir, mom was teaching me to play on her childhood piano at the time. Music is so important to me still, and just recently, almost 20 years later, I have started to tinker with my own production as a hobby. \n\nI never really realized the damage he did, but thinking back now, I would probably be quite skilled in a few instruments now.

But to teach respect for authority for the sake of authority presumes that authority is derived from itself. It is not. It is derived from a need for a rule of law that balances the needs of competing interest on both sides of a conflict. If it is derived from itself then there is no balance. Symbolically represented by the scales of justice. Only an authority unilaterally imposing it's will irrespective the legitimate interest of either party in conflict. The purpose of a legitimate authority is to impose, potentially by force, controls that limit the ability of any party from unilaterally imposing their own authority, often for no other reason than to edify their own authority. Often to the detriment to the legitimate interest of the parties being imposed on.\n\nIt is this dichotomy between these two competing definitions of authority that pushes the authoritarian to engage in punitive responses to any perceived failure to respect authority. And the labeling of anybody that objects as anti-authoritarian, thus deserving of a punitive response. This is how a librarian feels morally justified in taking a hard contrarian stance toward children, irrespective of the children's legitimate personal interest. Because the authority they were charged with is paramount over all other interests. This is how cops more often than not feel morally justified in violent responses to seemingly trivial infractions. The mere mention of anything that implies a boundary on their authority implies you are anti-authority, i.e., anti-police. Even if nothing could be further from the truth. Even the notion of training better cops presupposes that the cops are following rules, when in fact they are reacting to their moral imperatives about what constitutes authority.\n\nEven the majority of actual criminals are reacting to what they perceive to be a world of unjust authority. Without any alternative definition of what constitutes a valid authority, other than that of an authoritarian, it's hard to make a distinction between their own actions and those of the authority which pursues them. It's not that they are claiming their own actions are just. Only that their own actions are no less unjust than the world they perceive themselves to live in. Hence less unfair than requiring them to abide by an authority that accepts no such boundary on their own authority.\n\nThis librarian feels morally obligated to teach respect for exactly this form of authority. Not the one iconized by the scales of justice. Just as cops often feel morally justified in trap boxing you into a beating if you make any statements that imply boundaries on their authority. Thus, in their mindset, establishing probable cause to presume you are a criminal.\n\nThe friction between these two versions of what constitutes a valid authority is the foundation of nearly all high level civil conflicts. Often with neither side recognizing the existence of an alternative definition of a valid authority. Many anti-authoritarians fails to recognize any other definition of a valid authority than what is provided by the authoritarian, and visa versa. And this conflict will never go away.",

Verbos was the polar opposite.  Had a great personality, liked being around the students, would jump in the morning hacky-sack circles, and sought out students who were having bad days to see what was wrong.  He even brokered a deal with the smokers where he wouldn't bust them for MIP as long as they kept the smoking area spotlessly clean and didn't smoke anything other than cigarettes.

Personally, I think it's the dumbest fucking idea you can come up with.\n\nTo me, it's like a locked car in a parking lot.  If the car is locked and there is nothing of value inside to take, then chances are nobody will touch it.  But, regardless if you lock it or not, if you leave a $50.00 bill on the dash in open sight, someone is going to take it, one way or another.\n\nIn the same way, with no gun in a school, there would be far less chance of someone using a gun.  But if you introduce a gun / guns into the classroom, or several guns to several different teachers within a school, you are just asking for one of those guns to get into the wrong hands.  An upset child who might lash out one way, may see that gun as an opportunity to lash out in a different way.",

He'd smell weed and come over and tell us to at least not make it obvious and tell us to out it and go elsewhere to do that. He'd confiscate alcohol though because he drew the line at drunken idiot teenagers. He'd stop fights before they started and talk people down. He attended the graduation ceremonies every year even. He never did anything more than necessary, he wasn't there to give people records and ruin lives and if he could avoid actually arresting someone, he would. He knew we were teenagers and sometimes teenagers are just super stupid.\n\nHe was a part of the school and less of a cop and more of a person of guidance. He had the respect of every student. Literally not a single student had anything bad to say about him.\n\nIf all cops were like him, it would be amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case though and this was like 15 years ago now.\n\nI don't know he's still there, but Officer Jay was super cool.

So it\u2019s not really clear to me Florida\u2019s case is a legally simple one to win, and likewise it\u2019s certainly possible that similar Texas laws are written slightly differently or the state has existing case law regarding police during shooter situations that could make it easier or harder for them to prosecute officers in a similar scenario to Uvalde.",

The Constitution doesn\u2019t prevent a state from adding additional legal responsibilities for officers. In this particular case the prosecutors seems to be arguing that Florida law legally requires the officers to render reasonable assistance to children under their official care, and that this would include acting as appropriate according to their training for active shooter scenarios. \n\nI don\u2019t know anything about the specific statutes the prosecutors are trying to use here though so I don\u2019t really have a strong opinion on how solid their case is. My hunch is this case isn\u2019t a slam dunk for them and they might be using a novel interpretation of a child neglect law to prosecute this officer, and if so there\u2019s no guarantee it will stand up under scrutiny. For example, if that\u2019s the case, the defense might argue that if a parent of a child were outside the school in the same situation the parents wouldn\u2019t be legally required to put themselves in a life threatening situation to run in and try and confront the shooter, while the prosecutors would counter that officers have a stronger expectation of risk taking as caregivers due to their training. So who knows how this will turn out? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

If I do, its likely not city PD, but a sheriff's deputy, state trooper, or even more hilariously, one of the little towns that are surrounded by the city but have their town governments and importantly, their own PDs to run speed traps.\n\nBut that means there are long, straight, flat, roads that, when there isn't any traffic (IE between 6pm and 6am most days) you can straight up go 20-30MPH over the limit and its really not a problem. There are never cops on these roads. I have not ever seen a cop on some of these roads EVER in the 11 years I have lived in this city. I'm convinced that if they properly ran speed traps they'd make money and they'd probably teach a few people to respect traffic laws better. Or they could raise the speed limits. Or they could do some kind of road maintenance that makes it less tempting to drive 60 in a 40. But its been this way, like I said, since I moved here over a decade ago.",

I hope the guy just gets executed, but, legally, it's a stretch to say he was a legal caregiver to any of the children.  I don't like the idea that any officer can come into my home and take my children without any oversight because they've now decided that officers are legal caregivers to all our children. \n\nThey want to militarized the police, then treat him like an officer and charge him with cowardice.  (Also legally not justified-yet).",

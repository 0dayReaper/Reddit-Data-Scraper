It was surreal, but also funny.\n\n\nBut last year I was in Dresden with some friends of mine(who do not look typical German), and right outside of the central station a group of young people started screaming racial slurs at us, nothing happened, we were on the move so we didn't stop to confront them either.\n\nReally depends where you are in Germany, some cities can't stand racism and in some cities people feel save enough to randomly harass others.",

People around me, people that I\u2019m related to, have been trying to spin the story of southern secession to something other than slavery for years.  And I\u2019m here to say that what they are spewing is utter horseshit.  You can try to argue all you want, but all you have to do is read the articles of secession as they were written at the time.  Exhibit A is Mississippi\u2019s A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union (The Declaration of Causes of Secession) which says:\n\n\u201cIn the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.\nOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina, who kicked off the whole secession thing said in their \u201cDeclaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union\u201d that\n\n\u201cWe affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.\n\nFor twenty-five years this agitation has been steadily increasing, until it has now secured to its aid the power of the common Government. Observing the forms of the Constitution, a sectional party has found within that Article establishing the Executive Department, the means of subverting the Constitution itself. A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that \"Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,\" and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia Declaration of Causes of Secession uses the word \u201cslave\u201d, \u201cslaves\u201d or \u201cslavery\u201d 35 times.  In fact, out of the states that gave reasons for secession the concept of slavery is mentioned over and over and over.  The other reasons that the Lost Causers give for secession like taxes?  Taxes are mentioned one time and that\u2019s in regards to the federal government taxing slaves.  It doesn\u2019t matter how you try to spin this, the south left the union over the issue of slavery.  \n\nSo does that mean we should completely erase that part of our history?  Of course not.  But there is a huge difference in remembering it and glorifying it.  And by rewriting the narrative the Lost Causers are trying to glorify a very dark time in our country\u2019s history.  You can remember your ancestors, but at the same time you have to admit, to yourself and to others, that what they were fighting for was wrong.  You can find something about your heritage to glorify without referencing times and symbols that were so wrong.  And if you can't?  Then you need to get busy making a better heritage for your kids to remember.",

And Forrest what's-his-name starts the kkk as a gentleman's club to provide support for wounded confederate soldiers, since their government no longer exists to pay for their disabilities. I mean, that seems reasonable enough for southern philanthropists of the time. Well... Give it about 5 minutes, and other members start the racial terrorizing bullshit. Forrest is like \"not part of the plan, guys, time to go home\", and of course, no one listens. Terror reign continues, minus 1 guy that was only mid-level racist. So Grant gets into office,  and he's like \"Fuck this bullshit, I already won this war.\" He locks up the leaders, bans the organization for being terrorists, and effectively wraps up that crap campaign. And all is well (excluding everything that's still fucked up).\n\nAnyway. An early film maker, DW Griffith, makes a movie based on the book \"The Klansman\". It was so racist that it was considered pretty fucking racist in 1915. He later tried to make up for it by making Intolerance, which was like saying you don't approve of blackface while wearing it. Anyway. So, the Klan starts popping up again. Groups of guys forming their own little clubs. And despite doing pretty much the same exact shit as the first time around, it's yet to be disbanded. So, ummm, wtf?",

            "comment": "The commandant of the Marine Corps has banned the public display of the Confederate battle flag, a symbol that he said had the \u201cpower to inflame\u201d division.\n\n\u201cI am mindful that many people believe that flag to be a symbol of heritage and regional pride,\u201d Gen. David H. Berger said in a letter dated Monday and addressed to his fellow Marines. \u201cBut I am also mindful of the feelings of pain and rejection of those who inherited the cultural memory and present effects of the scourge of slavery in our country.\u201d\n\nThe intent behind the ban was not to judge the meaning that individual Marines ascribe to the symbol, he said, but rather to help build \u201ca uniquely capable warfighting team whose members come from all walks of life.\u201d\n\nThe flag has the \u201cpower to inflame feelings of division,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI cannot have that division inside our Corps.\u201d\n\nAll Marine Corps installations have regulations prohibiting the display of symbols related to hate speech, guidelines that General Berger said were intended to foster an environment that promotes unity and security.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nHe ended his letter by asking Marines to focus on the symbols that unite them: the eagle, globe and anchor.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the ban would apply to clothing and cars owned by Marines when they are off base and off duty. The Marine Corps did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nThe announcement came two months after General Berger ordered the removal of all Confederate paraphernalia from Marine Corps installations, according to CNN.\n\nIt was one of several directives, some of which he announced on Twitter, for \u201cimmediate execution.\u201d Among them were revisions of the corps\u2019s paternal leave policy and its enlistment policy, to disqualify applicants with a domestic violence conviction.\n\nGeneral Berger\u2019s announcement follows years of national debate over the removal of Confederate flags and monuments from parks, public squares and college campuses across the South.\n\nIn June 2015, Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina ordered that the Confederate battle flag be permanently lowered from the grounds of the State House after decades of political battles.\n\nFour years later, Ms. Haley was criticized after she told a conservative radio host that the flag had symbolized \u201cservice, sacrifice and heritage\u201d for some people in the state until Dylann S. Roof, who fatally shot nine African-American churchgoers in a racially motivated rampage in Charleston in 2015, \u201chijacked\u201d it.\n\nStatues and other monuments symbolizing the Old South have also been the subject of intense debate.\n\nIn November, a Confederate monument in Pittsboro, N.C., was removed from outside a courthouse where it had stood for 112 years, following months of what the chairman of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners described as \u201chigh emotions, division and even violence.\u201d Some cities have even gone so far as to auction off their Confederate statues.",

I try to tell them that those phrases aren\u2019t for the ballpark, and baseball is supposed to be an escape from divisiveness and politics in general. Then you get the random stuff, I remember a team about 5 years ago wanted a series of chickens...their team name was Chaos or something similar to that. It made zero sense given the name. I told him his boys probably wouldn\u2019t want to trade a pin with random chickens on it. Plus they\u2019d be known as the chicken-team. Which for 12 year old is probably a big deal...I sent a sample design of what he wanted and another one without the chickens and told him to have the boys vote on which they liked better. (My default response to questionable design ideas) The pin they ordered didn\u2019t have chickens on it. Typically, it seems the kids have a better idea of what should and should not go on the pin than the guy/girl ordering.",

He was the one who asked them kindly not to let me watch it.

People were like, there were so many positive things about your dad, why would you remember him with permanently marking yourself with a symbol of hate? He posted that he didnt understand why everyone was hating on him and he got it bc his \"dad liked Alabama football\" and also that he got fired from his job for it.",

He was from Chicago but said how some of the Southern guys got their confederate flag tats covered over after serving with people of a different color. \n\nNo room for confederate shit in the military. It takes away from unit cohesion and getting the job done.\n\nEdit: Plenty of other ways to show you're proud of being a country boy than that damn flag.",

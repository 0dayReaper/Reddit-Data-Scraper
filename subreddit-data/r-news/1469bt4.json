Officers dragged Cox by his feet out of the van and placed him in a holding cell prior to his eventual transfer to a hospital.\n\n&gt; Five officers, including those who were fired, face [criminal charges in the case.](https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-new-haven-reckless-endangerment-freddie-gray-2d3bd9636369e1dfcf092eaf400bfce8) All have pleaded not guilty. \n\nThey treated him like an animal, worse than really. Here's hoping they get serious prison time.",

The driver speeds up abruptly enough to get suspects away from the front wall of the holding compartment, and then they stiffly apply the breaks, so suspects will be flung forward rapidly against the front wall.\n\nWith body-cam footage showing the suspect was uninjured when he was put in the back of the van, then...he \"must have\" hit his head against the wall to fake a police brutality injury.\n\nThese cops are not only sociopaths, they are not very smart, either.",

There's a tiktok thing where they say if you give a baby an egg, they'll handle it with care. Some do, some do not. But the point is that even babies understand that some things are delicate. Unless you have zero brain in your head (in which why are you a cop), you have to know that putting a passenger in the back of a van with no seatbelt is not humane. \n\nAlso, you know this isn't accidental. It's so common with cops that it has a name...a name that you yourself used. \"Rough ride\". It's how they killed Freddie Gray in Baltimore. So please don't fuck around by giving them so much benefit of the doubt. If I told you to go pick up a birthday cake, you'll never EVER put it in the back of a fucking van and drive away like that. Because that's fucking stupid.",

Cox had been arrested on charges of threatening a woman with a gun, which were later dismissed.\n\n$45M is not even close to being enough. I think for cases like this, the victim's medical costs should be paid FOR LIFE. Then an award of $45M on top. Because I don't know how far that $45M will go for a lifetime of medical costs and also 100% help to do everything except move his head and maybe arms. This is a large award but honestly, it's not enough.",

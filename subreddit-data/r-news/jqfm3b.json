Then the surgeon has to sew the remaining parts back together in a way that allows you to still eat food.\n\nMy dad had his surgery 4 years ago and is still cancer free, but he still isn\u2019t healed, and we don\u2019t expect he ever will be.

Cancer is evil. Younger people are lucky to have new treatment options. Typically it takes about 10 years to develop and test a new drug to treat cancers. And about $2 billion dollars invested by whichever company, usually pharma or gov't sponsored, to complete the research. A pharma company can invest about $2 billion into creating a new drug or treatment option that is better than the current standard of care, only for it not to work correctly and hurt people, therefore ending the trial with all money lost and more importantly, lives lost. It'll be so cool to see a lot of the drugs on trial start to be used this decade. The future is extremely bright in regards to new treatments for younger and future generations. It just sucks we're still losing so many awesome people. Gotta focus on the future and knowing we may be the last generation to really have to deal with this bullshit. Also, anyone on a clinical trial is a true hero along with research nurses. Seriously heroes.",

Had a CT scan for a completely unrelated problem and they saw a 9cm tumor in one of my kidneys, which I have had no symptoms at all for it yet.  They thought it might have metastasized given some sclerosis on my ribs also showing up on the CT, but then I had a bone scan that came up completely clear.  So here's to hoping it has in fact not spread anywhere else when I have it removed in a couple weeks.\n\n---\nOn topic: RIP to a legend.",

I migrated to Reddit when Digg redesigned a million years ago. I saw the Arab Spring and Boston Marathon Bombing online, seeing the tweets appear rapidly onto my screen in real-time due to a penchant for following Boston sportswriters/coverage. I have never shied away from appreciating the good and bad that the internet had to offer, and have always been fascinated with its capacity for information, and connection.\n\nI'm in my mid 30's now, and the past year has been the hardest in my life. Where I used to enjoy being in the thick of everything, now it's just been so so exhausting. A couple of weeks back, in the middle of crafting a response to something I was VERY upset about, 10 minutes into furiously typing, I stopped. I just deleted the few paragraphs I'd been revising/editing, closed my laptop, and walked over to the window that looked out my front yard. It was early in the morning like 7 am I think, and I could see squirrels and birds and it was very very nice. I really recommend doing this as much as you want to, but for like 90 seconds minimum each time. There is a peacefulness to it that I didn't realize I needed.\n\nEDIT: Please do not give money to Reddit for my comment. Instead, please consider donating to one of the causes below \n\nEDIT EDIT: I Have been informed that there are some free Reddit awards, I will take my ignorance as a sign that I am successfully less online than I used to be. Thank you to the people who politely informed me of this.

Eddie could make a guitar sing and my Dad practiced so hard that sometimes I swear he was even better than EVH.\n\nDad died of a heart attack 2.5 years ago. It\u2019s been devastating to our family and the fallout that happened after is impossible to even imagine. When Eddie died last month I felt like my Dad passed away all over again. But I know Dad was there at the pearly gates with an extra guitar in hand to welcome EVH.\n\nHugs to you. Losing a loved one is awful. Alex Trebek was a staple in my home growing up, Dad and I watched every night together. I\u2019m sure he was there to greet Alex as well as many other fans like your grandma.\n\nETA: thank you so much for the wholesome award u/unlikely--hero. Hugs to you!\n\nETA 2: An anonymous friendo gifted me a hug award. So kind! I expected wholesomeness on this thread since Alex\nTrebek was an incredible person who touched the lives of many.

Before the show starts, we always guess what colour tie Alex is going to wear. It's been a silly game we've played between us for years.\n\nA few years ago for Christmas we decided to send him his own red tie with maple leafs on it since Alex is Canadian (so are we) and he actually wore it on the show. We read a [Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/12/alex-trebek-stylist-phil-wayne) on it and apparently he wanted to work it into the show. We weren't expecting him to wear it on the show, we just wanted to share how much joy it gave my mom and I each night.\n\nI'm really saddened by his passing. I applaud him for continuing the show even when he wasn't in good health. He was a really good man, made a ton of people so happy and did a lot for the trivia community. RIP Alex &lt;3\n\nEdit: For anyone curious, [here's him in the tie](https://imgur.com/a/LELie9F). This was January 2016.  \nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold! I'm glad the story is enjoyed!",

The 5 year survival rate is still only around 9% regardless of when it is discovered. \n\nThere are plenty of charities out there dedicated to fighting it, with the [Pancreatic Cancer Action Network](https://www.pancan.org/) works hard in DC to lobby for pancreatic cancer research funding.

I became kind of obsessed with beating them all, and as a result I started reading everything I could on science, literature, mathematics and history.  It turned me around, I joined my school\u2019s academic quiz bowl team, and dominated competitions.  Went on to graduate from a University with honors in History and Political Science.

Now I think\u00a0crying\u00a0means you're tough. It means you're strong enough to be honest and vulnerable. It means you're not pretending...\n\nBut it is by no means a fair fight.\u00a0Not even close.\u00a0It is simple biology.\u00a0You get treatment and you get better.\u00a0Or you don't.\u00a0And neither outcome is an indication of your strength as a person. Yet I still believe in the will to live.\u00a0I believe in positivity.\u00a0I believe in optimism.\u00a0I believe in hope,\u00a0and I certainly believe in the power of prayer...\n\nMy life has been a quest for knowledge and understanding, and I'm nowhere near having achieved that. And it doesn't bother me in the least.\u00a0I\u00a0will\u00a0die\u00a0without\u00a0having\u00a0come\u00a0 up with\u00a0the\u00a0 answer to many things in life. I'm often asked how I would like to be remembered.\u00a0I don't think about it much.\n\nBut I suppose if I had to answer I would say I'd like to be remembered first of all as a good\u00a0and loving\u00a0husband and father, and also as a decent man who did his best to help people perform at their best. Because that was my job.\u00a0That is what a host is supposed to do.\n\nYep, I'll be perfectly content if that's how my story ends: sitting on the swing with the woman I love,\u00a0my soul mate,\u00a0and our two wonderful\u00a0children\u00a0nearby.\u00a0I'll\u00a0sit there\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0while\u00a0and\u00a0then\u00a0maybe the four of us will go for a walk,\u00a0 each day trying to walk a little farther than the last.\u00a0 We'll take things one step at a time,\u00a0one day at a time.\nIn fact,\u00a0I think I'll go sit in the swing for a bit right now.

He's high functioning verbal and has a killer memory and love for all things TV, so when he gets an occasional answer right his face just lights up. Alex and Jeopardy have been a part of my family's lives since I was a kid. I grew up watching it with my parents and even now at 36 find myself watching it. He will be sorely missed. Goodnight, Canadian TV trivia grandpa.",

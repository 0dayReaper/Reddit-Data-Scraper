They blamed teacher for leaving door open against policy, said shooter was an avid gamer multiple times, and promised to investigate anyone with connections to the shooter.\n\nThey're just looking for scapegoats to blame. And if they can't, they'll just pin everything on the site commander. And by pin, I mean they'll retire with no repercussions, aside from being publicly hated and needing to move out of Uvalde.",

If you get shot in the lower abdomen and hit a major artery branching off the aorta you can literally bleed to death in minutes.  Even something as generous as a shot to the thigh can put life on a 5 minute timer--tourniquet or death. \n\nIn terms of my job, my goal is to be on scene (ambulance in park) and then leaving with the patient to a trauma center in less than 10 minutes.  This is extremely easy and 5 minutes is *easily* obtainable in a lot of traumas.  My last stabbing was a scene time of 4 minutes and 10 seconds. \n\nWhen dealing with these sorta traumatic injuries there is literally only one solution.  A trauma surgeon.  That is the only person who can save that life.  Tourniquets, if possible, help tons (can't tourniquet an abdomen though...).  Quick clot slows the process. Blood transfusions can buy you some time but it is absolutely imperative that those trauma patients get to the OR as soon as possible.\n\nI don't think there is a doubt that the PD delay cost lives.  I hope nobody forgets this.",

In that case, an RCMP officer was killed, and during a news conference the regional head spent a very long time talking about the bravery of the officer and lamenting the loss. Which I get, to a point, but they did not at all address the fact that 21 people were killed in that shooting, in an extremely disturbing fashion (this is before the public knew the extent, but they did). It's just came off as completely tone deaf.",

And these fucking pigs have the audacity to publicly celebrate that no pigs were hurt? They fucking let children take the bullets for them instead. Gutless cowards.

It's becoming apparent they said this so that if there were fatal wounds found from 9mm and .40 caliber rounds and not rifle rounds, that people wouldn't know. I'd bet they aren't cooperating so that information like that doesn't ever come out. So yes, likely five of them died from avoidable blood loss, but add to that several probably had decidedly fatal wounds from police weapons.",

This mother drove 40 MILES to the school, tried to enter the building, was put into handcuffs, convinced the police to uncuff her, wandered off, and then hopped the fence and **successfully rescued her own children herself**. All the while, the police had not yet stopped the active shooter.\n\nThe combination of cowardice or negligence or pure idiocy or all three displayed by the Uvalde police is infuriating. And they fucking know it.",

TRUMP told the individuals that the plan was highly confidential and secret. TRUMP also said, \"***as president I*** ***could have*** ***declassified it***\", and, \"***Now I can't***, you know, but this is still a secret.\"\n\nI'm assuming these lawyers were planning to hang their hat on the idea that prosecutors wouldn't be able to prove that Trump hadn't declassified the docs. This tape blew up their entire defense.\n\nDude is royally, royally fucked.",

Straight public defenders can't just say, 'mm, nah.'\n\nThey can recuse due to conflict of interest (multiple defendants in a single case, they know people involved) or if they have a legitimate reason. 'My client is demanding I perjure myself or commit perjury in court by putting them on the stand to give testimony we know to be false.' As an officer of the court (attorneys are) they cannot just blatantly lie. They should first counsel why perjury is not allowed and attempt to dissuade, and then tell the client the will have to recuse themselves, and then go to a judge and asked to be removed.\n\nPeople have a constitutional right to adequate counsel. Being a public defender, they can't just decide their client is a bad person and not take the case. Private practice attorneys can, but public defenders are assigned cases by the state and know that when they take the job. Everyone gets counsel to advise of their rights and ensure fair trial.\n\nFor multiple public defenders to bounce, it would have to be a conflict of interest or multiple attorneys resigning over major issues, like intent to commit perjury.",

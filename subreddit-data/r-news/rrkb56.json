This isn\u2019t the real shit. And this is alot worse than we\u2019re making it (we\u2019re overestimating the impact of these results, and these results aren\u2019t results) \n\n\nI\u2019d bet as well, that if a ballsy enough journalist really dig into all this. They\u2019d be dead. (The fact that this trial is similar to kangaroo court, people want justice or a sense of it but similarly to how some of us think everything is socialism, some are inclined to think one person taking the blame is justice. Similar to how people got fat and comfy off the chauvin sentencing- that wasn\u2019t justice for anyone, it was a facade, a blood sacrifice.) \n\nLet me elucidate- was police brutality ever solved by the chauvin trial? No. It wasn\u2019t with Rodney King, Michael Brown, or Trayvon Martin. And that\u2019s a small microscopic portion of the victims of police brutality. \n\nSame thing here. Child sex trafficking seems to be a really really deeply corrupt illegal, and irrespective of political affiliation, a ethicless, piece of shit thing to do. With some big names behind it. \n\nThere is so much wrong with this you could unpack. Holy fuck. But mainly the worst thing about our justice system, similarly to our political system. \n\nit provides the illusion of justice, whereas our political system provides illusion of choice.\n\n\nEdit; if someone could provide resources to help, whether it be donations or direct action please please link. We have to do something! The layperson such as myself have limited resources. Any assistance in connecting us layfolk to resources that help victims would be more than appreciated- but super impactful.\n\nWe can make a difference, if we rally together as one.\n\nThe rich can\u2019t have their way anymore. We have to do our part even if the contribution is small.",

So now or just after sentencing would be the perfect time for them to strike and suicide her. In fact if you think about it, if they are worried about her blabbing they need to suicide her pretty much now. Any chance of escaping the charges has now vanished so now she has no reason to keep her mouth shut.",

Individual rapists are one thing, but Epstein/Maxwell and Saville, with all the powerful people who they knew who never said anything, are clearly more important pieces in what is likely an international Web of children being trafficked worldwide.",

We struggled on one of the counts because the specific charge didn't match up date-wise with any of the testimony we had heard.

It may be that charge had some odd lack of evidence or that the defense had something for that specific count that managed to make them say \"That one we can't all agree on, but these ones everyone agrees, we'll just go with that.\"",

A big reason for the interview is to try and trap you in a lie. Then they either prosecute you for lying to the FBI, or use the threat thereof to get you to turn on someone else. Stewart thought she could outsmart the FBI; spoilers, she couldn't. They already knew what she'd done, and it wasn't that illegal. But she lied, and they could prove she lied, so jail for her.\n\nIf you, for any reason, ever end up needing to talk to the FBI, 100% get a lawyer.",

Your job is to gather intelligence through spying. Are you really not going to track the President of the US? Of course you are what if he's selling state secrets? Or has a vice that others can blackmail? Well you'd definitely follow him enough to notice that he's flying on those 1 random guys plane dozens of times. You'd follow up on who that dude is. Now you know what Epstein does, you have 3 options: \n\n1) turn him over to the FBI and let them charge him (obviously not what they did)\n\n2) ignore the fact there's a child trafficking pedo gathering blackmail on the world's elite,\n\n3) tell him \"give us your blackmail and we leave you alone, don't give it to us and we do 1)\".\n\nOf course they did 3). The CIA has done worse shit before, and they clearly didn't do 1). And I can't believe that they don't track the location of recently removed from office US presidents, they track everything",

The 10 years for 100 was more just to highlight how many other years worth of jail sentence aren't being served, not me actually suggesting the best way to get her to talk is 10 years, a guaranteed safer jail would be far better cos if she talks and ever leaves jail she's fucking dead",

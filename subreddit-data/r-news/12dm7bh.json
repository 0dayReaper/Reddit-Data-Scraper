If that were the case, the ACA would've been wiped out in 2017.\n\n&gt;some talk about passing some oversight legislation and John Roberts was 100% against the idea.\n\nWell, yeah, the [conservative institutionalist Chief Justice](https://archive.ph/Lunan) appointed by George W.

That's probably what terrified organizations into change the most. There was no assurance that people *would* leave. But even then, a few months later and people had to get back to work as the economy started opening up again, and by the end of the year we were back to a lot of the same shit happening again.\n\nWhen all that Brett Kavanaugh stuff happened, Mitch McConnell bluntly told the press \"it will blow over.\" He didn't even hide that he was counting on the fact that most Americans are incapable of being mad for long because they have other stuff they have to do.",

This hasn't changed in well over a year.\n* CNN =&gt; After the management shuffle from the TimeWARNer merger they both-sides everything and have started the gamification process that led Fox to become an alt-Reality dais of spewing hatred and instigating violence. They are faaaar better than CNBC and Fox for information and cover things more fairly, but they are worse than before the \"acquisition\" when it comes to democracy.\n\n\\-WSJ is a GOP mouthpiece (read any E.B. \"Opinion\") though their new editor-in-chief looks like she has some promise...at least listening to her words.\n\n\\-NYT is the most \"meta\" if one is looking for 'gems' amidst the main lineup, but they pick and choose their stories and the framing has been at times very disconcerting for democracy in recent years. AI-collated articles have been interesting, but I won't go too much into my meta-analysis of their coverage since they too had \"management changes\" that make the current stories look like \"Batboy\" compared to something like the Panama Papers\n\nMost state and local stations/papers are owned by massive GOP-run holding companies that have smaller companies that own these 'local' papers and collate their articles to siloize and divide Americans to vote for the best ~~Russian~~ person for office.\n\nOther channels and papers I have not had enough time to really make an informed opinion on.",

So I think they wanted me there to cover any baggers/cashiers that called off instead. I was also the youngest of the 5 members of that department, and the next youngest was the department head's son - so he usually got favorable scheduling.\n\nThe malicious intent behind it was clear when I specifically mentioned my graduation was Sunday morning, and they scheduled me for the late shift Saturday, early shift on Sunday. I was always (ALWAYS) scheduled in the evenings.",

Boards of Directors are ostensibly elected by shareholders but these are not competitive elections. Directors are there for their wealth, connections and often inheritance, not their skills. CEO's are the absolute dictators selected by the board and accountable to no one but them.

My argument to that is, then fine the rich a hell of a lot more.  \n\nThis guy sounds violent.  We should assess his likely chance of hurting others.  If there was a high chance, he might need physical separation.  Current US prisons don't offer reform, so there is another layer to peel back.  Not all prisons are like we imagine, though.  Some are pretty lax camps and don't foster more violence.\n\nSome people are just too violent and cannot exist around others.  There is often no \"reform\" for them.  Whatever the cause of that was, that should be resolved, and is another layer to peel back.\n\nThis moron probably just needs a nice hefty fine and a probation period, pay damages to the victim, and counseling of some sort.",

When I was younger the concept of \"the back,\" was a real thing.  Stores were much smaller and only had so much space to display stuff.  So \"the back\" is where stores would warehouse items where they could store them in a more efficient use of space.  Find a nice blue teapot on the shelf but you'd like to see it in green, the clerk would go in the back and come back with the green one.  As stores got bigger the model changed and we as consumers are basically strolling through the aisles of most everything the store has in stock. Now \"the back\" is primarily a breeding ground for conspiracy theories about how Karens are being cheated by the store in question.",

Everything was on a pallet and wrapped. As the manager said \"you don't make money on inventory in the back and if it stays in the back for more than 12 hours we have big problems.\" We weren't even allowed to look through it on customer requests because the pallet breakdown was too complicated. I have to think modern retail is even more streamlined than that was.",

This should be a law in every state.  However the US legal system is mostly a state level system.  Murder isn't against federal law, because it is a state law.  Pretty much all crimes against people and property are handled by state laws.\n\nEach state really should enforce laws governing assault against everyone, particularly essential workers in a pandemic.  I honestly think states should even put laws for bioterrorism in place when someone intentionally coughs in someone's face or wipes body fluids on someone during this pandemic.  But these still are state-level decisions, not federal ones, and the federal response in the US has been worthless anyway.",

A mask is mostly intended to prevent your germs from affecting others, and in mandated zones, people have the expectation that others will wear them. By choosing to not wear a mask in mandated zones, you are threatening people with potential bodily harm (particularly the vulnerable), and you're certainly causing fear.

You're allowed to go out without a mask if you choose. That's your prerogative. If someone tells you to put on a mask to come into a store and you choose not to go in, that's fine, too.

Even states that do classify assault as either threat or action won\u2019t charge people feloniously with it without certain circumstances being true.\n\nMost assaults don\u2019t qualify as felonies, and many states use things like \u201caggravated assault\u201d which is more felonious. Of course, if you\u2019re a repeat offender, even a basic assault/battery can be a felony.\n\nLaws are weird, but long story short, it varies state by state and these things are both misdemeanors and felonies.",

            "comment": "Hopefully this doesn't get lost.\n\nThis isn't about assault, but rather battery. In some states they are different. I don't know if Illinois has an assault charge, but this is definitely battery.\n\nAttacking someone is already battery in Illinois [s](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/072000050K12-3.htm):\n\n&gt; Sec. 12-3. Battery.\n    (a) A person commits battery if he or she knowingly without legal justification by any means (1) causes bodily harm to an individual or (2) makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with an individual.\n    (b) Sentence.\n    Battery is a Class A misdemeanor.\n(Source: P.A. 96-1551, eff. 7-1-11.)\n\nSo if you slap someone, it can be battery. This varies greatly by state.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nnew law is linked in the article [s](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=471&amp;GAID=15&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;LegId=116408&amp;SessionID=108&amp;GA=101) and the important part is:\n\nAmends the Criminal Code of 2012. Provides that battery of a merchant is aggravated battery: (i) when the merchant is performing his or her duties, including, but not limited to, relaying directions for healthcare or safety from his or her supervisor or employer or relaying health or safety guidelines, recommendations, regulations, or rules from a federal, State, or local public health agency; and (ii) during a disaster declared by the Governor, or a state of emergency declared by the mayor of the municipality in which the merchant is located, due to a public health emergency and for a period of 6 months after such declaration. Effective immediately.\n\nSo now it is no longer battery to attack someone while they are certain parts of their job, while under a state of emergency, it is rather aggravated battery.\n\nthis is [aggravated battery](https://codes.findlaw.com/il/chapter-720-criminal-offenses/il-st-sect-720-5-12-3-05.html)\n\nI'm not pasting the whole thing because it is far more comprehensive, as it should be. There is multiple different levels to it, and which one it is depends on the situation at hand. \n\nBut there is no indication that I can find in the new law that talks about modifying what kind of felony it is so this is the relevant part: \n\n&gt;(h) Sentence.  Unless otherwise provided, aggravated battery is a Class 3 felony.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Class 3 Felony (f3) is as follows [s](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/felony-offense/illinois-felony-class.htm):\n\n&gt;Class 3 felonies generally carry a potential prison sentence of between two and five years (or an extended term between five and ten years), plus one year of mandatory supervised release. People convicted of a Class 3 felony may be sentenced to periodic imprisonment for up to 18 months or to probation for up to 30 months. (730 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 5/5-4.5-40 (2020).)",

The business I'm working for specifically hired me and several others on for the sole purpose of monitoring mask usage by employees and customers so the managers could actually do their jobs instead of babysitting employees and customers over wearing their masks.  It's no sweat for me but employees who have no training in handling such interactions?  I can see why they'd legitimately fear for their safety because I've had people square up with me over it.\n\nIs it really worth, **at minimum**, a misdemeanor charge for fighting an employee rather than simply taking your business somewhere else?  You're still not going to be allowed to stay if you take a swing at me or another worker, so it's really just that much easier to pay your tab and leave.  Not to mention if you give me a hard time about it, you're gonna be asked to pay your tab and leave anyway.\n\nSo just wear your fucking mask and save yourself the same outcome with varying levels of lasting consequences for being a douchebag.",

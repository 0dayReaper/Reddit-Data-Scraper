I think the Iraq War protests and Occupy Wallstreet were both hugely de-fanged by the American media. It could have been picked up by the BBC or al Jazeera, but it wasn't. This is the sort of reason that journalism is called the 4th estate. I remember participating in this and really believing that the protests might stop the war because I was raised by hippies and the picture we have is that popular opinion turning against the war played a huge part in stopping Vietnam. I pretty much lost faith in my country, protesting, and journalism after that. These BLM protests are the first time I've seen protests gain traction. After all, people have been protesting against Trump since he won the election, but it's very easy for people outside of the country to not know that.",

When I talked with my dad on the phone a few weeks back and told him about wanting to get out of town for a few weeks since things were getting rough here his immediate response was to ask if it was because of the riots? We're one of the biggest cities in the country and you honestly couldn't find one of comparable size that's had *less* violence and chaos. It just straight up has been virtually non existent even though we have had quite a few protests.\n\nThey have no clue, they just see on Fafebook that some day they're going to have to make the life defining choice of plowing their truck through a crowd of protesters or sit there and get eaten like a mob of zombies in The Walking Dead. They really think that's a real life problem that they'll have to deal with.",

Even if you don't watch Fox, even if you're just watching CBS or what-have-you, this is the majority of your exposure to those protests aside from the occasional aside from your news center of choice. \n\nIt's no wonder that people are so ill-informed. They're primed to believe the absolute worst. It's hard to be rational when your amygdala is getting fingerfucked by conservative propaganda.",

He\u2019s a Trump supporter...mainly because he\u2019s a big \u201claw and order\u201d proponent. \n\nFox has convinced him that Portland and Seattle are under siege by Antifa and BLM rioters. And that without federal troops there they\u2019ll burn the city to the ground,  take over the country and destroy his business.\n\nI tell him ANTIFA is just a name a bunch of 20 year old kids use who like to dress up in black and throw shit at protests ... they\u2019re not an actual organization with any power. And the protests are pretty much constrained to a few blocks, during a few hour period at night. \n\nHe sends me a picture of \u201cexplosives\u201d the police found in the crowd. It was literally a picture of 2 smoke bombs taped together. Like, they were the shitty ones you can buy in a grocery store fireworks pack with the words  \u201csmoke bomb\u201d clearly visible.  \n\nI ask him why he\u2019s more worried about a few protesters throwing smoke bombs at a courthouse 3000 miles away....than the 150,000 people who have died of Covid while our economy is in shambles. And explain to him it\u2019s all a distraction from the real issue that is actively destroying businesses. \n\nBut he\u2019s so absolutely terrified of \u201ccommunism\u201d none of it sinks in. He\u2019s been brainwashed since birth that communism is lurking around every corner in America. He\u2019s sure that without Trump\u2019s intervention, AOC is going to use the ANTIFA and BLM army to convert the US into Venezuela and take all of his money.",

When I lived in Kansas City they had a neighborhood safety program where they assigned a dedicated officer (or two for opposite shifts I don't remember exactly) to a limited area, like a couple blocks. Everyone on that block had their officer's cell phone number and the officer regularly went around and interacted with the community to build trust. If those citizens had a hard time trusting the department, they at least knew that the one guy assigned to their block had their back. It was a good program.",

The only person I've seen say there will be a withdrawal is the governor while DHS is saying that there will be a phased conditional withdrawal, and based on an article written by the guardian [yesterday by the same author](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/federal-agents-portland-oregon-trump-troops) I find it hard to believe they've met the beginning of those conditions after one day.\n\nThen again, it seems [the confusion may be normal](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/confusion-mounts-announced-federal-withdrawal-portland/story?id=72075731).",

It doesn't really matter when they physically leave the city.  They're DHS employees, they have to be stationed somewhere.  What people care about is what they do, not where they are.",

I was watching the night before and there was a pretty big crowd doing pretty much nothing. I saw some small trash fires within the fence that the feds ran out and put out (seemed appropriate), then for a while nothing was happening but people standing there holding signs and chanting etc.\n\nThen the Feds just storm out again. They come from round the back, form lines, and just stomp around the whole area shooting masses of rubber/pepper bullets and tear gas. Stand there a bit on an intersection. Then retreat under another hail of fire.\n\nThere was no real *reason* for them to do it. It didn't accomplish anything I could see, beyond of course making everyone mad they're there and indiscriminately firing at protesters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, there was still a crowd. And they got left alone, and wow shock horror, there wasn't much violence.",

In total, 20 million people across Ethiopia rely on aid because of conflict and drought, out of a total population of about 120 million.\n\n++++\n\nThis is really concerning. Especially, since they didn't say who was getting the food.",

We can provide them with all the assistance we can muster, but there's no guarantee the aid will go where it needs to go. Clearly this shines a light on the fact that more oversight is needed, but if it's the federal government that's corrupt, how do you get oversight over a sovereign nation to ensure the aid is distributed fairly?",

My wife was working in Ethiopia at that time and says that many of the goods sold in the local shops and markets had the USAID stamp on them. The really pernicious effect that the aid had (aside from corruption), was that local farmers could not compete with all this \"free\" stuff. At the time the aid community lived quite well. My wife described lavish banquets at the Hilton in Adis and various embassies, and those who were fortunate enough to work for the UN often came away with decent pensions (paid in US Dollars).",

Neither I nor anyone else at the table had heard that. It hadn\u2019t been covered in the American press. This was just six months after the Live Aid concerts in Philadelphia and London had directly and indirectly raised over $100 million dollars for famine relief in the African nation. The next day I asked my sister Nina, an assistant at SPIN then, to research this, because if the country was at war, it would surely be difficult to move aid around and get it to people who needed it.\n\n\n&gt; In those days we didn\u2019t have the Internet, so research was done by going to the library and trawling through endless spools of microfiche \u2014 film of newspaper pages from around the world. That evening she came into my office ashen faced \u2014 she had discovered it was clear, and very well evidenced, that this famine, the awful depictions of which had pulled on the world\u2019s heartstrings, was **man made, by government planes deliberately napalming rebel farms**.",

All goods and services require large groups of people to oversee and distribute those things. And if the system efficiency improves, the risk of fraud can perversely increase. Then you need to add a layer of oversight to prevent waste fraud and abuse. Medicare for example is incredibly convoluted and forces legitimate businesses to jump through hoops to prove they are not defrauding. It can feel very inefficient. And yet Medicare is a much more efficient system than private health insurance.",

The only groups who actually did any good were the ones who were in it for the long haul.\n\nI think the take-home message is that aid is an extremely complicated, multifactorial thing which requires serious commitment and expertise.

I'm not proposing any sort of UN intervention to solve the political problems there. Just a laser focus on providing aid. \n\nFor a good example of how to do this, I recommend looking at the deployment of NORDBAT in Yugoslavia. They didn't try to solve the war our even stop it, but they did stop civilians from dying, and they did it through force.",

They followed absolutely absurd rules of engagement and did what they could to help people, but were ultimately disarmed by Serb forces and allowed the massacre at Srebrenica to happen.\n\nNORDBAT was notorious for disobeying orders, including direct orders from the UN and their own government. Instead of following absurd rules of engagement, they did not hesitate to shoot at the enemy, nor were they afraid of escalation. Unlike DUTCHBAT, they went into Yugoslavia expecting a fight and brought the best tanks they could get ahold of. Because of that, they were able to accomplish their mission and civilians remained safe under their trigger happy watch.",

Yet it has a high birth rate. The food aid started post WWII and has never stopped. That means almost everyone alive in the country now were born while the country didn't have enough to eat. That's insanity. The droughts keep making the news every decade, but they are cyclical! It's not unexpected. You should know having a baby in the wet years that there will likely be a drought before they turn 10.  And yet...\n\nIt's obvious that the aid is not helping long term, and is likely keeping the region from ever becoming functional.\n\nRather than aid, they'd need long-term economic development assistance. But that isn't possible due to the conflict, violence, and corruption that plagues the region.  \n\nThey also need to lower their birth rate and reduce population size to a level the natural resources could support.",

            "comment": "This is the reason I stopped donating to big charities. When you see how much is taken from the donation before It actually reaches the people it was ment to help if it ever reaches them at all, it really makes you hate these charities for what they do. I now work security for a group of office buildings, in one of the offices is a charity for helping distribute food aid to the less fortunate in the UK. Then I see them turn up to work, each one of them driving ferraris,lamborghinis and Aston Martins to work. They often throw events in one the spare offices we have, I have worked only 1 of the nights they held one. Guests turning up in similar cars, champagne being giving out to guests, displays of fresh vegetables, meats of all sorts on display to show off what they hand out that was then thrown away the next morning because it was left out over night, professional chefs hired for the night providing catering of foods I had never heard of before I my life to guests. Honestly the whole event sickened me and just further increased my hatred for the \"charities\" that do nothing but boost the bank accounts and egos of the people that run them.\n\nAdditional: it's worth mentioning as well I was once one of the less fortunate that needed help gaining access to food as I was out of work due to an accident and was not getting sick pay, so had no income what so ever for two months. Everywhere else refused to help me because \"they didn't have the resources available\". I then found out my local church was giving out food to those in need. It wasn't much but it truly helped and meant a lot, a box of bread and pastries that was past their sell by date so stores couldn't sell them but were still good to eat, some vegetables and fruit, tinned foods, jarred foods and even personal hygiene products. If this local church could do it then these nationwide food \"charities\" have no excuse.",

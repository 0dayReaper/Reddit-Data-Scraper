You don't make one big case and have to prove it all or the person gets off, they get charged with in this example 7 separate charges of human trafficking and evidence is presented for each charge and it is either proven in court or not. \n\nIt is common to get a guilty verdict on some counts while others are not proven and get a not guilty verdict. You still get sentenced for any of the charges that you are found guilty on even if you are acquitted on some of the other charges.",

Each of these cases is a part of that pattern, so winning all of them adds to the collage of character they're trying to paint of him. While he could get off on certain charges, losing one of them lessens the strength of the others. It's not like they're only going to find him guilty of trafficking one of the women. Add to that the international pressure on Romania to step up its anti-trafficking efforts, Tate's own comments on his perceived belief that the legal system there is ineffective in this area and the sizeable legion of young men who will believe that the trial was biased against him from the beginning, and winning as definitively as possible is as much of a political victory as it is a legal one. Prosecutors already only ever bring cases they think they can win but here there's an added incentive to make every one a slam dunk",

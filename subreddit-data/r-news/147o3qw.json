The blow to landlords means a two-year fixed deal priced at 5.22% on Monday will cost 6.79% on Tuesday. One broker suggested the move \u201ccould sound the death knell for buy-to-let, at least with NatWest\u201d.\n\nOh no, the poor landlords",

The longer the period is fixed the more risk the lender assumes, so generally the more expensive it will be.\n\nThere is general concern that rising interest rates to combat inflation will negatively impact house prices, leading to negative equity and high borrowing costs, making a new borrower (with a small equity to begin with) on a short term a high risk proposition.",

The average mortgage term is still 30 years, it\u2019s more that you can\u2019t fix the rate for the entire duration of it. What happens is you take out the mortgage (for 30 years) and you can choose to fix the rate for a certain period, often for 2 to 5 years. Once that fixed rate expires, it will automatically roll over to a variable interest rate (somewhat based on what the central bank is doing with its rates). You can just leave it on the floating rate, re-fix it for a new term or refinance it entirely if you want.",

There's nothing particularly problematic about that. Helping people buy homes is exactly the kind of thing governments should be subsidizing. The system continues to work well, and regular people are currently able to get 30-year fixed loans. I don't know why you think that is a bad idea--it's worked well for generations in the United States, and default rates and home ownership rates aren't particularly different than other wealthy countries. We just get the certainty of knowing what our payment will be for a long time. In my opinion, that's awesome, and it also allows people to make long term financial plans--which probably has a lot to do with the fact that entrepreneurship is much higher in the US than Europe--people are able to confidently use equity in their homes to create businesses, because they can predict their future payments.\n\nThe biggest real estate crises we've had in the US was when adjustable rate mortgages got popular, and then rates rose at the same time prices dropped. All the people who didn't have fixed rates were screwed. But most of us weren't impacted much at all. I'd feel a constant sense of anxiety if I lived in a country that forced my loan to adjust rates every few years--you're at the mercy of the macro economy. \n\nAnd homelessness is an issue in the US, for sure. But it's driven by home construction policies and mental health laws, not lending practices. In Europe, most of the people who would be homeless in the US are in institutions--you just have different standards for involuntary confinement. I definitely think we're getting that wrong in the US, but it has nothing to do with fixed rate mortgages.",

The monthly payments were amortized over a 20-year period for 59 of the months, and then on the 60th month a balloon payment of all remaining principal was due. Usually a couple of months before that balloon payment is due you and the lender re-negotiate for a new 5-year mortgage (again, with a long amortization and a balloon payment on the last month), with the main difference being the new 5-year mortgage reflects an update market interest rate. You rinse and repeat this cycle until the loan is paid. \n\nI imagine the 2-year UK mortgage is somewhat similar to how ARMs work in the US.",

They will offer a term of fixed interest, usually 2 years to 5 years. This is what the article is referring to.\n\nEg. At the start of your ~30 year mortgage you have 2 years fixed interest.\n\nThe fix is obviously a gamble. For example, you fix at 2% but interest rates go down to 1.1% then you're stuck paying 2% until your fixed term is up. It can go the other way too.\n\nAt the moment, across the UK, people who fixed 5 years ago at 1% are both counting their lucky stars and shitting their pants simultaneously because soon their fix will end and their mortgage interest will rain down upon them at 6% with no forecast of returning to earth.",

Most people* tend to vote with their monthly payments. The vast majority of mortgages will be 25 to 30 years with 2 or 5 year fixed.\n\nAs for FM/FM, we don't have an equivalent. There were some rumblings about it after we bailed out Lloyds/Northern Rock/RBS but it didn't come to fruition. It probably helped that UK house prices fell by less than half what US suffered after 2008.\n\nWe do have a help to buy scheme which is broadly in a similar direction aimed at getting people into homes.",

Generally people prefer to negotiate a new period of fixed rate as it makes planning easier, though sometimes, for example when central bank rates hit rock bottom in 2008, it has been advantageous to just roll over to the variable rate.",

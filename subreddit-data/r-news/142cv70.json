In the late 60s and early 70s they wrote a lot of music eulogizing the afro-brazilian culture of Bahia that Moraes didn't come from, but was in love with, and believed was integral to the cultural heritage of all Brazilians, regardless of ethnic origin.\n\nHere's another version of this same song that you might also enjoy, by Vinicius himself and a very talented guitarist called Toquinho: https://youtu.be/0FEUtp6iFrw\n\nAstrud's intepretation of this song is of course excellent though. \n\n\nAnd the news is of course sad, but one has to say that, at 83, and with her many achievements and enduring legacy, it was a life very well lived!",

Great female vocals on it too, if you like Astrud you'll probably love it. All these people were part of the same scene, and all collaborated with each other at various times \n\nSorry for the long-ass comments, any excuse to spread the good word about this music haha",

It frames the whole thing as though a romance between them could work out if he just had the courage to approach her. The original lyrics are very simple but they convey a feeling of oceanic distance between them which is key to what makes the song so quintessentially Brazilian.",

How can one make such a generalized qualitative judgement when there are so many musicians making music inspired by and building off of great music like Girl From Ipanema? I'd encourage anyone to go beyond the radio and top 100 when looking for more current music that they like, because you're potentially missing out on a lot of great music that could grow into the next Girl From Ipanema.",

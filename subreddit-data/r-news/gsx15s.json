It was reasonable to believe he was poorly trained and made a really bad mistake.\n\nThis Chauvin guy though decided to kneel on this guy's neck for 8 minutes, even after several bystanders stopped to express concern for Floyd's well being.  It's much more difficult to argue a mistake here. JMO",

No arrests, the whole thing happened so fast, the officers made quick split second decisions. \n\n2020: here we have one in slow motion, clear video, audio, names, faces, the entire encounter, no threats and only a man asking for half of the weight of the officer to be removed from his neck so he could breathe. \n\nLet\u2019s see how *this* one plays out.

So let me tell you the real horrifying story.  \n\nI was on a grand jury for nearly 4 months.  We met once a week, with one week a month off.  We heard 15-20 cases ***a day***.  \n\nGrand jury is where you decide if it goes to trial.  I felt a lot less pressure because I wasn't sentencing a guy or anything, just saying whether or not there was enough evidence of the crime to go to trail.  \n\nSounds easy right?  \n\nOh lord...\n\nSo when I showed up to the mass jury selection day, they randomly pulled 60 of us to the side.  They literally pulled names out of a hat in front of everyone.  I was next to last of the 60 called.   They told us we were selected for grand jury instead of normal jury.  So many people made up stupid excuses to get out of jury duty.  I felt it was my duty as a citizen to do my part so I stayed on.  \n\nMy boss asked me why I couldn't get out of it.  Most of the smart people got out of it.  I wanted to stay - maybe that makes me an idiot.  But if one day I was arrested for something I didn't do, I'd want someone that had a brain on the jury.  So I stayed.  \n\nMost of the people on the jury were either idiots or people that wanted to see \"punks and gangsters\" fry.  And their definition of a punk or gangster were really loose.   \n\nFor most cases I thought the evidence was pretty well laid out and I voted to go to trail on all but one case.  \n\nBut damn these idiots.   One rape case in particular was just so... ugggh.  Sometimes I get nightmares about that case.  Not because of the rape description ***but because of my fellow jurors***.   She woman had been locked in a car and threatened that he would cut her if she didn't comply.  My fellow jurors were insistent that since she didn't ***try*** to flee (she did try the doors, btw) and he didn't actually show her the knife or any other weapon then it wasn't rape.  \n\nThe mental hurdles I saw people go through to defend their worldviews.  My God.   These are the kind of people you get on a jury because most sane smart people try to get out of jury duty.   \n\nThey'll defend their own and the people they respect, but they'll try to fry anyone different.  [I also talked about the case here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g4sier/lawyers_of_reddit_what_case_you_wish_you_never_won/fo1g5tm/) if anyone wants to see more, but my rant is done for the day.",

I\u2019d be a professional juror if it paid well enough. \n\nWhen I sat on a jury, I had a good bunch. A young man was charged with child abuse, and the prosecution did a good job laying out the facts of the case and calling medical experts. The defense was given a bad hand, and did the best that he could with what he had.\n\nIn the jurors room we had two charges to consider. The charge of child abuse was pretty easy to come to terms on, after a bit of discussion with the hold outs. \n\nThe charge of assault is where things got interesting. One lady claimed that we were doing the child a disservice if we didn\u2019t convict on all charges. Another thought that assault sounded about right. The rest of us considered it an overcharge by the prosecution and eventually wore down the other side. \n\nI\u2019ll gladly service on a jury again, because I\u2019d want someone competent sitting on my jury if I\u2019m ever falsely accused of something. Others should have the same.",

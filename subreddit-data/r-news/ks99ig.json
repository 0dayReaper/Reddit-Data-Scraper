The most notable members being lighthearted were Sasse and Graham. People who are directly responsible for the type of rhetoric and enabling of Trump that influenced this woman to leave two children motherless.  \n\n\nIn no way do I mourn her, but if you can't see the vileness of these very politicians who are complicit in the storming of the Capitol cracking jokes during debate a few hours after her death in the same building, you're as blind as those members. You're also trafficking in the same dehumanization that the right is fomenting. \n\n\n\nIt seems likely you may be the exact type of person that the dead terrorist was.",

Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.\u201d\n\nEdit: This is just to the Trumpers. I still consider you Americans. Personally, I consider you brainwashed, but redeemable. Seriously, the party you acknowledge is only using you for initial power to defy free and fair electoral processes. The party you claim to love makes millions. I KNOW you are not millionaires. You are blue class workers like me. I work on people\u2019s decks. I make less than 100k a year. Why do yo defend them? Why are you defending the rich? That is all the Republicans participants are. They vote for the disgustingly rich, we are the fucked. Vote for a party who actually gives a shit about you.",

I don't even like golf (I am taking care of an older relative who's a sports fanatic) and I was impressed. Fleetwood gave Taylor a run for his money. Plus, $980k in 2nd place isn't too bad for a day's work.",

High stakes golf is aight. Maybe their should just be sudden death elimination tourneys and i could become a legit fan.",

The conservative Heritage Foundation [looked for fraud](https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/494649-the-voter-fraud-fraud) over a 36-year period and could only find [1285 cases out of nearly two billion votes cast](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/09/21/voter-fraud-fears-and-mail-worries-grab-headlines-but-the-wait-will-be-the-worry-in-2020/) - a rate of 0.00007%.\n\n* There are election observers in every room where ballots are counted and there are livestreams of most of these counting areas. Yes, this includes Philadelphia, where the Trump Campaign had to [admit in court that they had observers in the room.](https://twitter.com/alanfeuer/status/1324484846857658368)\n\n* Mail-in ballots are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots since the Civil War, and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail.",

In theory, the PA state legislature could decide to ignore the vote of the people and select whoever they want to be the state's electors who actually vote for the president (they are who we elect when we vote in the election, and it is generally understood that they will vote for who they said they would but they do not always do so). It may sound like a crazy conspiracy theory, but it has been acknowledged as a potential plan by the Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman ([https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/))\n\nPennsylvania however does not look like it will end up being the pivotal state, and this extraordinary step would have to be taken in multiple states for Trump to win, which imo significantly decreases the likelihood of it occurring.",

It's the best feeling since March to hear a city celebrate and not just survive\n\nEdit: Very happy to hear about everyone else's city erupting too. Can report from a friend that Mill Valley (north of SF) is also rocking at the moment\n\nSecond Edit: Sorry, I didn't think to take a video. I put down my phone pretty early on as I wanted to clap as much as possible -- anyway, a video from my perspective would just be hearing me hollering like an idiot. Big shout out to the pot banging family on the other side of Broadway who waved back and danced with us! Lastly, for those who cannot celebrate out in the streets for whatever reason, you're welcome to the party in this thread. I have family in law that are in a similar situation so they've mostly plopped down with a big fry up breakfast!\n\nThird Edit: Thank you very much for my first reddit awards. I'd give the spiel about money being better used elsewhere but I am going to pretend that these are the free gifts that reddit keeps trying to hook people with. Big shout out to u/leaveittobever who came in clutch with the video from Chicago! It's basically what my experience was but with a better view and less pots and pans. Can't thank everyone enough for all the wonderful replies about their cities -- a nice reminder of what social media was supposed to and can still be. Y'all have made my day twice as nice",

Mac thinks voting goes against the will of God, while Dennis is convinced that voting is playing right into the scheme of the big system, and will eventually lead to fascism/theocracy.\n\nCharlie decides that he is sick of the bar and thinks it's the perfect time to pursue his dream and become a mailman. He does so but can't figure the job out, so ends up bringing all the mail home.... which ends up being hundereds of ballots. They don't find the ballots until Dee turns Charlie in because she's been hearing about all the delays. When the cops show up to get the ballots from Charlie, they find him passed out from all the drugs he found in the mail, which he decided to take all at once.\n\nMeanwhile Frank is busy driving around the state in Dee's car, as fast as he can, going to different \"Count the Vote\" and \"Stop the Counting\" rallies. He thinks sowing discord will be good for his business, but he gets in over his head and somehow ends up naked at a vote count complex\n\nIn the end, Dee never gets to vote, Charlie goes to jail to sober up, Mac and Dennis end up mad at eachother (again), and Frank gets on national television, naked",

Are we ok living in a society that tells women that their bodies need to be covered up? Is a man\u2019s mammary gland different than a woman\u2019s? Why is cleavage ok to expose but not a breast(in this instance she was covering her nipples).  \n\nThese are all big boy questions we can\u2019t even dive into in todays climate because of fuckin polarizing everything is. But they are legitimate things we should be trying to figure out together.",

The choices of words being made are really poor. \n\nReading the article, the person banned is just digging in their heels and failing to consider for even a moment that they might be wrong. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what the right wing does. Don\u2019t be like the right wing, folks. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to be better. It\u2019s ok to admit when you\u2019re wrong. If you\u2019re just out to be polarizing for the sake of being polarizing you\u2019re not helping anyone\u2019s cause except your own.\n\nEdit, so the answer was: several people decided to be topless at the whitehouse for clicks on social media, and they were all banned. It wasn't based on gender or being trans, it was based on poor decision making. Shame on Rose Montoya. Don't be like her.\n\nY\u2019all can downvote all you want, but I guarantee Rose will continue to be an embarrassment for attention all while dragging the word trans right on through the mud with her. Her cause is money and attention, that\u2019s pretty clear. That\u2019s what influencers do. Trans people can be shitty people too, and Rose Montoya is giving off real \u201cshit person\u201d energy. \n\nFind some deinfluencers. You\u2019ll know them because they won\u2019t try to sell you anything but instead they\u2019ll still expose truths. Again, without selling you anything.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to let each one of you who replied the next time Rose steps up her trash person game. From what we\u2019ve seen today, it won\u2019t be long.

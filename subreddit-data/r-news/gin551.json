I found out about this a week ago and have been sharing it all over social media hoping it'll be viral like Arbery's murder. I am honestly so happy that this story made it to reddit's frontpage. \n\nBreonna was an EMT and was working in two hospitals during the pandemic. Her life was ended out of nowhere because of some trigger happy officers who broke into her own house for no reason. As a black woman this terrifies me. We're not safe even in our own houses because apparently cops can just break in and murder us for crimes they think we've committed without facing any repercussions.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold though I in no way deserve it, please spend on donations for people struggling during this time.\n\nAnd since this comment has so much attention [here's a petition for justice for Breonna if anyone would like to sign.](https://www.change.org/p/andy-beshear-justice-for-breonna-taylor?source_location=topic_page)",

            "comment": "Similarly, Police in Houston did a no knock raid, shooting and killing a couple after obtaining a warranty based on totally fabricated evidence from an informant that didn't even exist. They broke in, plain clothes, shot the dog, shot the couple, shot each other, and claimed that the old guy that they killed managed to shoot 5 of them with a revolver vs all of them with guns blazing. The union president (and current national FOP vice president, Joe Gamaldi) went on to say:\n\n\"Enough is enough. And if you're the ones that are out there spreading the rhetoric that police officers are the enemy, just know, we've all got your number now. We're going to be keeping track of all ya'll, and we're going to make sure that we hold\u00a0you\u00a0accountable every time you stir the pot on our police officers.\" \n\nOther Houston police union officials have tweeted things such as that the couple are \"still dirtbags\" even after the fabricated warrant came to light (and untagged drugs were found in the lead officers car, used to plant). \n\nThe officer most responsible for the raid had a 34 year career, with hundreds of cases now under review, and several overturned after it came to light he has made arrests and got convictions for years on completely fabricated evidence (as well as pocketing money for fake informants). He has since been charged with murder of the couple in the Harding street raid. \n\nSo when you think about how bad no knock raids are, just remember, some of the top officials of the national fraternal order of police not only support them, they actively threaten anyone that speaks against such tactics (or really anything that isn't licking police officers boots). Since the DA has pressed charges against the officers, the local union has become increasingly vocal about \"activist DAs\"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecan_Park_raid",

Louisville Metro Police Department executed a search warrant at the wrong home, the suit states.\"\n\n\"The officers were looking for a suspect who lived in a different part of the city and was already in police custody after he was arrested earlier.\"\n\nSo they went to wrong home, looking for someone who was already in custody, and prompted a gunfight where they shot up the house indiscriminantly (another quote said bullets were food in pretty much every room). It's crazy that stuff like this happens. Like don't you double check an address 100x before you bust in? Wouldnt you radio in before going? Giving them a chance to tell you \"hey we already got him.\" When your job involves serious stuff like this wouldnt you check everything constantly to avoid any mistakes?\n\nEdit - bullets were FOUND in pretty much every room",

A group of people then kicks your door in in the middle of the night, and you're right up with that rifle in your hands and adrenaline pumping ready to fight but with little idea what is actually going on.  \n\nAre you just going to put down your gun if you happen to hear them yell police over all the other commotion and your racing heart?  What if they are bad guys and just yell police to throw you off?  I can't really say in good conscience I'd like to see somebody prepared to defend their home actually kill a few cops like this and live to tell what happened, but maybe it would change some minds about these tactics (though really, who am I kidding...).",

More racial segregation predicts more police violence (https://bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/). **So does receiving military weapons from the feds** (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918784209\n).\n\n&gt;Despite the US govt\u2019s unwillingness to track police violence, we now have comprehensive data on killings by police via WaPo, http://mappingpoliceviolence.org &amp; http://fatalencounters.org. While we don\u2019t have enough data on non-fatal violence, we can learn a lot from the data we *do* have...\n\n&gt;When we break down the data by city, there are massive differences in police violence rates per population. St Louis, OKC and Orlando consistently have the highest rates of police violence. Killings are 3x less frequent in SF or Philly, 4x less in Detroit. http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities\n\n&gt;Who\u2019s impacted by this violence? Black and brown people. This chart shows the race of unarmed people killed by police in major cities from 2013-19. Almost everyone was Black or Latinx. Black people are 3x more likely than whites to be killed by police &amp; more likely to be unarmed.\n\n&gt;Among places that reduced police shootings, SF, Philly, Chicago, Denver, San Jose, LA, Phoenix and Baltimore made their use of force policies more restrictive during this period. Many had DOJ investigations. &amp; many reformed enforcement of drugs/low level crime, reducing arrests.\n\n&gt;This is consistent with previous research finding departments with more restrictive use of force policies (http://useofforceproject.org) and DOJ interventions predict reduced police violence. Despite this, the Trump admin has stopped these DOJ investigations. https://vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings\n\n&gt;Importantly, cities that reduced police shootings did so regardless of levels of crime. Crime rates (including violent crime rates) actually went up slightly in major cities during this period - but police shootings declined consistently with a 41% reduction during this time.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, having more Black officers is NOT associated with reducing police violence in most studies (some studies suggest more women on the force can help tho). Implicit bias training also hasn\u2019t been shown to make a real difference. But a factor that DOES matter is...\n\n&gt;THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. Just as some depts have higher violence rates, some officers have higher violence rates too. In Columbus, 6% of officers commit 50% of all use of force. When the system fails to hold them accountable it causes MAJOR problems...\n\n&gt;See now we can track how police misconduct spreads. And officers in close proximity to officers who have records of misconduct end up being 4x more likely to use force &amp; 5x more likely to shoot someone. We can *contact trace* police violence like a virus. https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-social-network/\n\n&gt;Accountability systems work if they intervene &amp; remove officers BEFORE misconduct spreads/escalates. But only 7% of excessive force complaints are upheld/result in discipline and 1% of killings result in prosecution. So these officers remain on the force. https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/data_stories/police-use-of-force-data-a-huge-mess-across-the-u-s/\n\n&gt;Here too, data helps us understand how to increase accountability and decrease police violence. Misconduct complaints are more likely to be upheld when depts have body cams (video=key) but much less likely to be upheld in depts with police union contracts. https://gothamgazette.com/city/9167-initial-report-shows-benefits-and-challenges-of-nypd-body-camera-program-for-watchdog-agency\n\n&gt;This is because police union contracts are where the accountability system is set. Most contracts purge misconduct records, restrict misconduct investigations and help officers overturn discipline and get reinstated after being fired for misconduct. http://checkthepolice.org\n\n&gt;In fact, police depts with union contracts that grant more procedural protections to officers accused of misconduct are:\n1) more likely to be reported for misconduct\n2) less likely to uphold misconduct complaints\n3) more likely to kill unarmed people https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246419\n\n&gt;So the contracts matter, and they need to be re-negotiated to increase levels of accountability and to reduce police violence. But what about the exceedingly low rate of officers being prosecuted? Well, we know more about this topic now than we did 5 years ago. For example...\n\n&gt;While only 1% of all killings by police result in officers being charged with a crime, this 1% isn\u2019t evenly distributed. There are a handful of places that routinely charge officers while almost every other place fails to do so. And those places tend to have Black prosecutors.\n\n&gt;We still don\u2019t know what tactics these prosecutors are using to secure indictments in these cases, but electing prosecutors (esp. Black prosecutors) who genuinely care about holding police accountable is important. This + video evidence are factors that can make the difference.\n\n&gt;So we now know:\n&gt;1) which depts have the worst police violence rates &amp; which are reducing it\n&gt;2) a set of interventions/factors associated with reducing this violence and increasing accountability\n\n&gt;By continuing to study &amp; scale up what works we can end police violence nationwide.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/samswey/status/1259254114606886913\n\n&gt;A day with 'killology' police trainer Dave Grossman\n\n&gt;Grossman at one point tells his students that the sex they have after they kill another human being will be the best sex of their lives. The room chuckles. But he\u2019s clearly serious. \u201cBoth partners are very invested in some very intense sex,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of perks that come with this job.

The absolute bare minimum requirement for kicking in someone's door should be to verify that the door is the right one. There is zero justification for that mistake to not result in jail time.",

As I was running to grab pants, he starts to try to open the front door, which I happened to have locked. At that point I was terrified, mostly thinking something bad happened. My husband is a teacher, so I thought maybe there was a shooting at school, I\u2019d heard sirens earlier. Or maybe we needed to be evacuated or something. My mind was racing and my heart was pounding as I opened the door. \n\nI saw the cop walking back down my front sidewalk with a duffel bag in his hand. I called a meek \u201chello?\u201d and he was just like, \u201cOh, wrong house\u201d and kept walking.   I never found out what it was about. \n\nWe used to keep our house unlocked all the time.

She didn't criticize my driving like others in the office. She was so nice all the time. These assholes murdered her and I'm pissed off because i know nothing is going to happen to them. I am disgusted because it will be treated like the Amber Guyger case and swept away. I am fucking hurt because people all over the world are going to make lies about her and excuses for these fucks. I was over hearing about this kind of thing when it didn't involve people I know. Now I'm blinded by rage and i feel nauseous. Most of all I feel absolutely helpless because there is nothing I can do for her except defend her and express my anger. There was no justification for any of this and I'm tired of our police getting away with murder.",

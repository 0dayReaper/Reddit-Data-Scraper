When you smoke you have a higher metabolic rate and ironically burn more calories living the same lifestyle as the nonsmoker. \n\nWhen someone stops smoking they typically don\u2019t become more active they just do the same\u2026. Only now they aren\u2019t burning as many calories because their metabolic rate has lowered. Sure some might eat more, but even if you ate exactly the same you\u2019d gain weight.",

They ***cause*** sugar craving, blood sugar dysregulation and metabolic syndromes. \n\n2 years clean from the drugs and I still can't get below 150lbs or lose this bizarre fat distribution the drugs caused. Even with severe calorie restriction. I used to be able to fast for multiple days, had normal appetite, etc. Now it doesn't matter how full I am. I am ALWAYS hungry. I had to change my diet to two servings of konjac noodles, 2 glasses of fiber powder mixed with water and a salad of at least 2lbs of lettuce or 2lbs of broccoli just to stay barely sated.\n\nEdit: that's not my WHOLE diet. That's just the low calorie bulk I had to add. Antipsychotics/mood stabilizers also fuck your cholesterol and triglycerides and this put my numbers back to numbers I haven't seen since I was a teenage athlete. The big changes happened after adding the konjac noodles and powder.",

Benzos and alcohol are both GABAergic substances that act on different subtypes of GABA receptors. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts in opposition to glutamate which is an excitatory one. Too much glutamate is what will essentially overload you and precipitate seizures. These seizures can 100% be deadly. It\u2019s very serious depending on how much you\u2019re abusing either and for how long. \n\nAs I got older to my mid twenties my hangovers started getting a lot worse and I could feel that push and pull neurochemically. I was always good about hydrating and that sorta thing so it wasn\u2019t the dehydration it was the rebound effect. I used to be able to sleep off alcohol well enough, then I started to get the signs of glutamate rebound where it\u2019d get up-regulated as alcohol was getting metabolized. So say I was up til 2 AM at age 20 drinking, I could still sleep in 10 AM or like 12. Got 8-10 hours, rested enough. Obviously drunk sleep was never good sleep but it wasn\u2019t terrible. \n\nThen it turned into being bolted awake at 6-8 AM with some anxiety. Even when drinking pretty moderate amounts like 3 beers it started happening more as I got older just clearly affecting sleep quality and with more excessive drinking it was, of course, worse. It\u2019s kinda like an acute withdrawal feeling even if it was only like once a week. Wake up way too early despite what time I went to sleep, be hot and sweaty, hands clammy, kinda shaky, very alert and couldn\u2019t sleep or nap it off, anxiety and general restlessness and discomfort. All because of glutamate being suppressed while under the influence then it shooting back up to get to homeostatic levels. \n\nYou can see how this turns into the vicious cycle of addiction pretty quick since both benzos and alcohol are anxiolytic in the short term, but will then generate worse anxiety after it wears off with habitual use. One reason why hair of the dog is a \u201changover remedy\u201d it kinda smooths out the withdrawal \n\nDon\u2019t really drink anymore. Alcohol is a pretty shitty drug all around if you think about level of \u201chigh\u201d to side effects even with moderate use.",

From the article:\n\nCaution is needed in interpreting the findings, Serlie said, as much is unknown: \u201cWe don\u2019t know when these profound changes in the brain happen during the course of weight gain. When does the brain start to slip and lose the sensing capacity?\u201d\n\nObesity has a genetic component, and although the study attempted to control for that by excluding people with childhood onset obesity, it\u2019s still possible that \u201cgenes are influencing our response in the brain to certain nutrients,\u201d said Farooqi, who has studied the role of genes on weight for years.\n\nMuch more research is needed to fully understand what obesity does to the brain, and if that is triggered by the fat tissue itself, the types of food eaten, or other environmental and genetic factors.\n\u201cAre there changes that occurred in people as they gained weight? Or are there things that they were eating as they were gaining weight, such as ultra-processed foods, that caused a change in the brain? All of these are possible, and we don\u2019t really know which it is,\u201d Farooqi said.",

                                    "comment": "Like u/FlatulenceIsaVirtue above, I've pretty much never felt full.  I've been overweight most of my life but not exceptionally so as I am very highly active (hard physical labour job, 15000+ steps per day, etc) though in my late 40's I'm having an ever harder time controlling my weight.  \n\nBut my whole life, even when I was very fit, I could sit down and for example eat two large pizzas effortlessly and not feel full.  I have always struggled with snacking because I never get a \"ok, that's enough\" brain signal, and if I'm distracted (say, talking to people, watching a movie) I will continue snacking unconsciously until there is nothing left, *no matter how much I've eaten*.\n\nThere is a point where I physically cannot eat more, not because I feel full or nauseous, but because there's literally no more room and I'll start vomiting.  However, that's NOT like when Normal People feel nauseous from eating too much.  It's not the same at all.  Because normal people get that nausea feeling WAY before they are literally physically full of food.  I'm very aware of the total physical volume of food you can fit in a person and it's way more than you'd think.\n\nThis is not to say I eat constantly like some caricature of a fat man.  I don't.  I typically only eat once per day and not a large volume, but I have a lot of problems in environments where there's open food and I'm distracted.  Like social smokers or drinkers, it's easy to lose track.  \n\nSadly, while I don't feel full almost ever, I feel hungry almost all the time.  And I *like* food, it's yummy.   So my life is one of constant hunger, pretty much 24/7, which is usually just made worse by eating, not satisfied.  It fucking sucks.",

He\u2019s been your prototypical average male, a BMI right on the upper end of normal thanks to carrying a little extra muscle mass from playing college hockey and still being active. Can get away with wearing medium sized clothes right off the rack unless he wants something a little more loose, than a large will do. [He\u2019s literally been a model for Vineyard Vines.](https://imgur.com/a/Oo4SjAA)\n\nThen there\u2019s me. I was always much bigger and [went on to play football at a small D1 school](https://imgur.com/a/h8SLt68). Thankfully I was always very active and worked out a lot so even though I was always eating, I never really got above 285, and that was me pushing myself to gain weight while playing in college. But still, that\u2019s a solid 100 lbs. heavier than anything my brother ever weighed. And after college, with my activity declining over a period of 10 years, my weight ballooned up to about 420 lbs. \n\nA big reason for this was that I never had really developed that sensation of fullness that would trigger me to stop eating. When I was so active that wasn\u2019t as much of an issue. But I was so much bigger growing up, even though we all ate the same things. [Look at me at 12, compared to my brother who just turned 11.](https://imgur.com/KrixHhX) Our mom prepared most of our dinners and always gave us packed lunches. But I\u2019d always have to get like an entire plate of seconds because I was still hungry.\n\nCut to now and the past few months I\u2019ve begun taking WeGovy. This follows a few years after undergoing a gastric sleeve. I had gotten my weight down to 265, but the pandemic and personal life challenges led to it creeping up again. I\u2019m still not up to the full dose amount of WeGovy, but I\u2019ve already lost 17 pounds. The biggest thing has been the signal of fullness I get while eating and it lasting in between meals so I don\u2019t mindlessly snack. Most of our friends are skinny Asian women, and now when we go out to eat, I find myself eating just as little as they do. I can\u2019t even finish a full plate. And then I feel full so much longer. It\u2019s amazing. I finally feel normal and like I have control over my eating because I don\u2019t have such intense hunger pains and food cravings.\n\nI cannot recommend enough that people look for doctors who specialize in obesity medicine and medical weight management if you\u2019re struggling with your weight. Weight is a much more complicated thing than many give it credit. Yes, the old adage of calories in vs calories out still rings true, buts it\u2019s a bit more complex and intertwined with so many other things. The new drugs available are great.",

Most common type of thyroid cancer is papillary, (90%) which is safe with ozempic or any glp1. The medullary thyroid cancer is also theoretical (youre right) since it's in rats, these meds been around for 10 years now and no significant data of increased incidents.\n\nMost GI side effects are due to people eating too much shit after they think they are okay. Meaning they inject, feels fine first 2-3 days, think they are safe, then eat a heavy meal and get wrecked.\n\nPancreatitis is the real risk, but exceeding rare so not generally an issue unless you already have really high triglycerides/alcoholism.\n\nOtherwise super safe, kidney issue is not a legit concern, people become dehydrated cuz they throw up/diarrhea, AKI, happens with everything.\n\nGo up on dosage monthly, if out of pocket every 2 weeks and careful what they eat.",

Also, missing a few weeks due to outages and coming back on the 5mg dose was absolute hell.

Most people will probably gain weight again when they stop as they will have their \"fullness\" signals go back to normal.  The main way to keep it off seems to be like any weight loss  with disciplined lifestyle changes. \n\nIt's definitely a great and useful drug, but probably won't be the miracle many think it is.

My issue stemmed from the fact that I could only ever eat 1,000 calories a day. I\u2019m 5\u20194. So I\u2019m not ridiculously short. I would put myself in like a 700 calorie deficit every other day just so I could eat normal on the days I could eat. For me to maintain a healthy  socially acceptable weight I could only eat 900-1000 calories a day. This is very hard to do when you see other people getting to eat 1500 calories a day who are very skinny and doesn\u2019t seem like they are even trying that hard to watch their calories. I gained all the weight back mostly and I am once again attempting to lose weigh. This is actually the third time I\u2019ve lost an excess of 50lbs and gained it all back only to try again. It just gets exhausting after awhile. I usually get to 220 -240. That seems to be where my body always goes back up to and when I lose the weight and am pretty toned it always seems to put me in the 150-170s. I\u2019ve always been very active. Me being worried about regaining the weight doesn\u2019t ever really deter me because I have so many mental health issues on top of my weight issues that most of the time I barely notice my body is changing until it\u2019s too late. Likewise when I do lose weight I also have no idea. The first time I lost the 80lbs I barely noticed I had lost any weight at all. It wasn\u2019t until I looked back at pictures that I realized I had looked any different at all.",

My insurance covers 100% of the bill. And I'm already on several medications including the generic for Advair which still costs like $400-500 a month. I doubt they'll cover anything more. I end up having to fight them tooth and nail every few months on getting the generic of Advair because I've tried the cheaper options for inhalers and they don't work as good and usually end up giving me thrush. Trying to get them to pay for pills without generics is almost impossible.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather rip out my ovaries and end the PCOS that way. No ovaries, no PCOS, right? Wouldn't that solve the weight problem that comes with PCOS? I don't want kids anyway.",

I've discovered that for me, it's the excessive carbohydrates that shut off my ability to be full. When I restrict my carbohydrate intake to less than 50g per day and increase my fat intake, my urge to binge goes away and I feel full and satisfied. But if I have a cheat day, it spirals very quickly into feeling constantly hungry again. \n\nAfter I figured that out about myself, I actually found a [Harvard study](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2018/11/27/effects-of-varying-amounts-of-carbohydrate-on-metabolism-after-weight-loss/) that showed that excessive carbohydrates interfere with the hormones that signal you're full. It makes sense that excessive carbohydrates might disrupt more hormones than just insulin. Diabetes can't be cured but it can be put into remission by avoiding carbohydrates. Maybe it's the same for feeling constantly hungry. You can put it into remission so to speak, but if you return to a high carbohydrate diet, you go right back to the bottomless hunger pit. \n\nThat's been my personal experience. It would be interesting to know if others felt similar.",

Other food usually makes me feel sick. And often one day suddenly, with no warning, I'll stop wanting to eat those foods and never touch them again. \n\nAt the moment I subsist mostly on tea, Tim Tam's, chocolate, cream cheese with Pringle's, and crumpets with honey. I have real food a few times a week. It has been this way my whole life. Sometimes the foods I'm focussed on are healthy like my year of eggs whites with Philadelphia cream cheese on a wholemeal English Muffin half, and some are terrible like my current ones.\n\nI also regularly go days or weeks where no food at all is appealing and I have to force myself to swollow every bite. Even if it's a food I usually love and I'm hungry. It's like the food turns to ash as it approaches my mouth and my whole body and mind is repulsed by eating. \n\nI also rarely feel hunger pains, even when not taking my adhd meds. I never did, even as a kid. So it's hard for me to know I need to eat until I get to the feeling dizzy and weak and hands shaking stage. Same with water. I once forgot to drink for three days when I was a teenager and went blindish in school before I realised that I needed to drink ASAP. \n\nI wonder if the researchers in the OP article studied anyone who'd been obese like me that didn't feel hunger pains and felt full very easily? I'm a petite woman so my small stomach fills up quickly and I can definitely tell when I've eaten enough. Sometimes I'll squeeze in a small nibble after if the foods great but I do feel full and can easily stop at that point or before.",

I knew by then I had autism but hadn't pursued a diagnosis and it felt so unfair that she got all these free passes when I didn't.\n\nEven years later a friend who was friends with both of us told me that I was different because I didn't act autistic enough so people (her included) *knew* I could act normal if I wanted and was thus always in the wrong if I messed up.\n\nNo longer friends with people like that but it still stings to think about and I'm always on guard socially still.",

From my experience with diets prior to the one that succeeded (which was my version of the Weight Watchers scheme, except I counted every calorie instead of points), if I had taken shortcuts to lose weight, like surgery or taking drugs to help, I think 2020-2023 would have seen me return to 600lbs. \n\nI believe my weight loss success is about developing a behavior and sticking to personal rules in the face of my body and mind regularly trying to convince me I NEED MORE FOOD ALL THE TIME.

My mind, my body, will convince me even 5,000 calories isn't enough. \n\nNow, that doesn't mean I don't feel \"full.\" I do. I can feel full from eating a salad. It's that feeling \"full\" doesn't change whatever being overweight did to me. It made me a perpetual food addict. The only thing that works for me to combat it is constantly moving. \n\nI am 51 and never take a day off from working out. I put in at least 15,000 steps per day. I never miss a day.

Individuals with obesity have impaired responses to sugar and fat in the nucleus accumbens.\n\n2. Weight loss of 10% over 3 months does not fix this impairment.\n\nThese findings are important because they help explain (1) a potential cause of obesity and (2) the commonly observed regain after weight loss.\n\nIt sounds like you're asking why the researchers tested for recovery after 3 months rather than years. One reason is that obesity-induced changes tend to closely track weight, so we might expect recovery to happen quickly as well. Another reason is that it's simply very difficult to get participants to be 10% less heavy a year from now. It requires constant monitoring and adjustment of diet. This brings us to the closely related third reason: A finding that NAc response recovers after a few years *wouldn't matter* \u2014 because by then, most people have regained the weight. It would be interesting to the scientist but useless to the clinician.",

Intermittent fasting is the perfect solution. Not only does it relegate you to 1 major meal a day, (and snacks like nuts and yogurt in between) but it forces your body to realize that you don't actually need that much food so when you DO eat your meal, you feel full after a normal portion.\n\nAnd you should always be exercising, no matter how old you get. Exercise doesn't necessarily mean becoming a gym brah (nothing wrong with that either) but it can also mean finding an outdoor hobby that keeps you moving around so that your metabolism doesn't slow to a halt.\n\nI'm middle-aged and I've lost 15 lbs in like 3 months, which may not sound like much, but I wasn't actively dieting, watching calories, or anything. I just swapped to intermittent fasting, drinking more water to stay hydrated, and picking up gardening/yard work as a hobby.",

Like 95% of the stuff in the interior of the grocery store is processed/ultra processed thanks to 5 major companies making the majority of our food. Eating out, less processed but like you said its full of fat/sugar/salt.",

Cook my own food, check calories, eat a lot more vegetables and salad with meals, using light products instead of full fat (dairy products), regular walks. I lose about 2 lbs/week on average (stagnates sometimes, speeds up sometimes) and it\u2019s quite easy to keep it off because the food is lower calorie but a good amount so you don\u2019t have to eat such a small amount. Lost 55ish lbs so far.",

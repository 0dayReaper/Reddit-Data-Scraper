They are facing potential termination because the suspect in that case returned later in the evening and killed the victim.\n\nWait, someone is holding cops responsible for their bad choices, sort of like almost every other profession?",

I'll never understand why it isn't the standard. People point to pay as a reason, and that's just short-sighted. It's pay is similar to many jobs requiring a degree, plus places waste a lot of town funds on garbage policing practices that actually could be used towards pay. My take is it's a bureaucracy that encourages hiring uneducated goons, so there isn't questioning if inept leadership and corruption.",

You obtain a law enforcement certification from the State, which is a license to be employed as a police officer. It can be suspended or revoked by the State, usually a State commission exists to review and make the determination. They have rules on what offenses can result in probation, suspension or revocation of the certification. In some states, like California now, that commission publically publishes a list of all police officers who have had their certification revoked or suspended and why. To get hired in the state, your certification has to be in good standing. \n\nTo your point, un the past, California's commission didn't have the power to suspend/ revoke certifications for anything other than issuance problems (obtained under fraud or obtained in error). They left all disciplinary issues with the respective employer and it wasn't reported anywhere if a cop had severe issues. \n\nThe issue in the states with the commissions I described is they are often given leeway in making a decision and can override their own rules. For example, a cop may get convicted of a felony, and the commission is supposed to revoke the license permanently; however, they can decide to just suspend it.",

The federal government can't get all police departments to report crime statistics for FBI reporting and struggled to get 40% of police departments to report just the number of officer involved use of force complaints just for statiatical reporting. In the use of force one, the DOJ even said that if they can't get 60% participation then they just won't do the reporting. It's insane",

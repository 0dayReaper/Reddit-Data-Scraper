Since these are almost certainly designs that were copied from overly inflated Russian tech. \n\nWhatever leak that happened to allow Western tech to instantly adapt to Eastern rocket tech, also likely made its way to them. \n\nOr, the US is lying about being able to shoot these delivery vehicles down and we're all screwed anyway. But the fact that Ukraine isn't drowning in fire after potentially hundreds of kamikaze drones and various types of ballistic and cruise missiles a week, seems to indicate that Ukrainian air defense is holding very well. \n\nWhich means - imho - that these sorts of vehicles aren't really effective, and can't be produced in any number by nations that don't have access to the resources. China might be the only one aside from the West that can produce these in any large amounts. And a war with China would be catastrophic for everyone anyway. Just as war with Russia is catastrophic already.",

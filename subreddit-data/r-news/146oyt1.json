Cuba needs the USA far more than the USA needed Cuba. The USA got their sugar, tobacco, rum and baseball players from other sources.\n\nIn addition, I read in the same article **The U.S. first imposed an embargo on the sale of arms to Cuba on March 14, 1958, during the Fulgencio Batista regime.**\n\nSo, in a sense, the USA actually helped Castro by denying arms to Batista! So it was doubly stupid for Castro to do what he did.",

US companies that set up in Cuba were not compensating the people there fairly to begin with which is what led to the revolution in the first place. They were benefiting from slave labor because the Batista regime allowed it and then also want to be compensated for not being able to exploit slave labor? That's some stupid ass line of thinking only Americans can come up with.",

We even tried to lodge protest against the maneuvers of Russian intelligence vessels, but they (like us) played by the international rules so there's little to be done about it.\n\n[https://navalpost.com/russian-intelligence-ship-viktor-leonov-arrives-in-havana/](https://navalpost.com/russian-intelligence-ship-viktor-leonov-arrives-in-havana/)\n\nToday, there is no logical reason to put nuclear weapons in Cuba. China (and of course Russia) has ICBMs and SLBMs capable of reaching American targets without needing to bother with the myriad headaches of basing strategic weapons overseas.\n\nFun fact: one unusual clue that indicated Russian troops were stationed in Cuba at the beginning of the Cuban Missile Crisis: soccer fields at military facilities \u2014Cuban soldiers tended to play baseball. Before you dismiss this as silly, the NPIC photo interpreters who noticed it were correct. Another funny clue from the old days of photo reconnaissance: the presence of large communal kimchi pots at heretofore undiscovered military barracks in North Korea.",

Literally if the performer dies or critically injured mid movie, the studio needs to cover their losses on the project. It why sometimes key performers can lose out on roles. Richard Pryor helped develope Blazing Saddles but couldnt get insurance backing, so the role went the way it did. Robert Downie Jr was likewise a risk after going in and out of rehab and jail. \n\nThe fact that the studio didnt disclose it is HIPA laws preventing the Sharing of medical information. Just because your insurance adjuster may be privy for a decision, does not mean that others have to be in the know. I respect Marvel for hiring him, and keeping his privacy private. \n\nCan we please just start 2021 early and just map election day to the date on the new calendar. I just can't take anymore of this year.",

Since it all happened during lockdown I didn't really pay attention until I had a real sharp pain in my abdomen and went to the emergency room. Three weeks later there I was in the doctor's office hearing that I have a mass on my colon and a bunch of stuff in my liver and that the only thing they can do is suppress it for a few months because surgery is not an option. I'm 32.\n\nIf you've got blood in your stool or weird/unsettled gut stuff going on over a period of time, **go to a doctor**.\n\nEDIT: The gut stuff is hard to describe. It felt a little like I had eaten something weird, or I had mild food poisoning? I was just aware there was something strange/new going on in my abdomen. At the time I thought it was just stress because we'd gone into lockdown. In retrospect it's because there were tumors growing in my liver, and you feel them if they're pressing on the outside of the liver.",

As a doctor I have met many people with this attitude who died from their illnesses. You can convince your mind of something and have it still not be true. It's denial and it is extremely common when people are dying. I'm glad that didn't happen to OP here, but when your doctors tell you that you will die from something, you should make sure you understand all of the options. Sometimes there are possible treatments with a low likelihood of working, or experimental compassionate use medications, and sometimes there are palliative and hospice teams that can make a huge difference and allow you to die the way you would want to. If your doctor is worried that you might realistically die, let them give you all the options. You don't have to ignore chances for a longer lifespan, but you should understand what the final steps in your life could look like, and take the opportunity to make it what you would want while you have that option. Hospice and palliative care teams are there to help you take ownership of your final days and make them what you want, whether that is at home or in a hospital.",

As of May this year they had not filmed or even finished the script. \n\nBlack Panther was an important movie, so I hope they are able to do 2 still. We need more minority representation, especially in leading roles. Chadwick has repeatedly talked about how badly he wanted the role and how important expanding the roles of black actors and actresses was in Hollywood. \n\nI don't think it is selfish. He had pride in what he did and his goal was noble, to show Hollywood (and everyone else) that movies with black leading roles are financially viable and socially important. \n\nI hope Marvel can find a way to do a tasteful memorial and send off for him. Most importantly I hope his family can eventually find peace.",

Let me preface it by saying I don't know if Chadwick had this or not, but his young age makes it possible and reminds me of my family's situation. \n\nThere is an inherited gene mutation that causes something called Lynch Syndrome. It affects the genes responsible for correcting genetic mistakes that occur when our cells replicate. It causes colon cancer and endometrial cancer primarily and other cancers less commonly.  A person with Lynch has up to an *85% lifetime risk* of colon cancer!\n\nI know because my hubby was diagnosed stage 3c when he was only 41 years old. 4 years, 2 surgeries, 2 rounds of chemo and one removed colon later and he is doing ok.  We learned he has Lynch after talking to his Mom (after his doc questioned him) about his family history of cancer (which turned out to be extensive and he had no clue) and a positve genetic test. His 2 siblings are positive as well and his sister had a full preventative hysterectomy to cut her risk. It was a close thing for my husband because he ignored the warning signs for so long. He has a long road ahead. Our whole family does.\n\nPLEASE PLEASE talk to your loved ones about your family cancer history! Early detection is key to good outcomes. Now we have to hope our 2 kids beat the 50/50 odds and don't inherent this awful condition. \n\nCheck out [Lynch Syndrome International](https://lynchcancers.com/) and [NIH.GOV](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lynch-syndrome) for more info.\n\nRIP Chadwick, gone too soon.",

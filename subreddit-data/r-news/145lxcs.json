When I say that, I mean, the government thinks it is there right to order you not to purchase certain drugs, regardless of your personal needs and wants. The federal government is the nanny telling you, no, you cannot eat from the cookie jar, \"I'm in charge, not you\". That is the general sentimiento I feel. But, in other ways, it's not a nanny system, because a nanny would help you find alternative drugs, and help you get better. I suppose the USA is the crazy nanny that everyone thinks is wonderful, but the people she takes care of knows the truth.",

In the US the excuse was they didn\u2019t want another loss after a failed intervention in Somalia, and just went back to give an apology speech 4 years later. People calmly decided they where not worth protecting. Makes the people like Damas Gisimba who did act shine even more, I mena the man ran an orphanage and out his own family\u2019s life in danger",

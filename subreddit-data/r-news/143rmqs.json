I said this in above post but dude mentioned their family values tour,\nTill pulled out a strap on that shot out fake cum on a song called \u201cbuck dich\u201d (bend over) this was in late 90s. I think the keyboard guy bent over and he was swinging the wang and fake cumming on the front row people lol! \n\n\nIf you watch the video for their song \u201cmein teil\u201d (my part- slang for \u201cmy wang\u201d in German basically) they are walking all fours in bondage gear while signing about a serial killer that chopped a dudes dick off and cooked it and ate it\n\nOr man geggen man (man against man) is about homosexuality and the music video also has homoerotic overtones big time. \n\nRammstein and sex are like peanut butter and jelly basically, they\u2019ve gone together as long as they been around.",

Given the rest of the article's content, I don't think they're censoring themselves here, and the only claim is that he was on top of her. It also says the singer asked her if he should stop, but doesn't say what her reply was.\n\nIf I were investigating this as a possible crime, I'd want to know a few things, such as:\n\n1. In which way was he on top of her? Lying right on her body? Standing over her? Holding himself above her with his arms? \n\n2. Was he doing anything while on top of her? Touching her? Kissing her? Trying to wake her up?\n\n3. Did they previously have sex? Being on top of someone you've recently had a sexual encounter with isn't nearly as threatening as being on top of someone you don't know. Was he waking her up for round 2?\n\nThis situation can go from extremely creepy to reasonably normal depending on a lot of things.",

It appears that girls are regularly brought to Lindemann for sex, but the situation around this girl's allegation doesn't seem to be much of a story.\n\n1. She said \"no,\" and while upset, Lindemann did not push the matter. By the girl's own words, \"Till did NOT touch me. He accepted I did not want to have sex with him. I never claimed he raped me.\"\n\n2. She thought her drink had been spiked, but \"a urine test she obtained from a pharmacy showed no sign of drugs in her system.\"\n\nThen there is a very short blurb about a second woman's allegations, where she woke up with the singer on top of her (it doesn't say he was having sex with her, just on top), then he asked if she wanted him to stop. Presumably, she asked him to stop because he then left.\n\nI don't see how there's much of a story here. 95% of concerts probably end with members of the band hooking up with fans, and a girl complaining that a singer tried to hook up with her, but respected her decision to say no, is not a story.",

The singer asked for consent, but it doesn't mention her answer. It's a bit troubling that the singer was on top of her at the time, but it doesn't specify what \"on top of her\" means or if they had a previous sexual encounter that might make it much less creepy. Eg. did they have sex, fall asleep together, then he woke up and tried to get her to go for round 2, but she said no, and he left her alone? I guess that doesn't make for a good headline.",

Reading those comments first almost had me not read the article as that is a sensitive subject. However I decided to read it and there's a large difference, innocent or guilty, between a 24 year old and a \"young girl\" in this context. \n\nNow I'm in my late 30s so I generally consider someone that age still young, but that's not the impression that's being given. \n\nNow the actual acts, two are mentioned. One, a woman says she thinks she was drugged. The band says that she should not be discounted. SHE SHOULD NOT BE. I see some folks that seem to be saying things that are discounting this. I also see that SHE said that he didn't touch her and was respectful. \n\nThis means that if her drink was spiked (in this context I mean if she was just not very ill from drinking) it may have been someone else at the after-party. \n\nThe second woman said she essentially blacked out and woke up in a compromising situation with him. He asked her consent to continue, she said no, and he left. \n\nThis one is the most concerning. Did he know she was blacked out? Was she still awake and just super drunk? (Black out drunk). Even if so you can't consent at that point. Had she previously consented? (It really still doesn't count but it does change the situation). Was she just asleep passed out? All of these things affect the circumstances and I believe the police are looking into it for that reason. I do not question why she didn't go to the police in the first place. \n\nThey have fired the person who was organizing this and grade stopped the parties.",

I have to assume that he didn't intend at any point to violate her or disregard her consent, because if that was the case, why would he bother asking if she was okay with him going on?",

When the 24-year-old made clear that she would not have sex with him, she claims the singer reacted angrily.\n\nAt the pre-concert party, the woman said, she had two alcoholic drinks but then started to act erratically from about 8.30pm, with gaps in her memory, leading her to later fear that her drink had been spiked. A urine test she obtained from a pharmacy showed no sign of drugs in her system.\n\nIn a follow-up post on 30 May, the woman said: \u201cTill did NOT touch me. He accepted I did not want to have sex with him. I never claimed he raped me.\u201d\n\nSeveral stories have since been reported in German media that show similar experiences of fans being \u201ccast\u201d to have sex with the Rammstein frontman. -\n\nI have a few questions?\n\n\"If you're a rockstar, why the hell do you have to recruit fans for sex? If the allegations are true, is it a power trip?\n\nIn the follow up, he accepted that she didn't want to have sex with him? Ok, so did he really do these things or what?\n\nNot all musicians are clean upstanding citizens. I get that. If all the allegations are true, it's a shame when you already have what you want in front of you. Without having to rape or seduce. \n\nI was a rock singer back i the early 90's to 2000's and from my perspective, I've had to turn down requests. I just don't swing like that. (I also have a beautiful and intelligent girlfriend that satisfies my needs). \n\nIt just boggles my mind why idiots make the chooses that they do and go down that path.\nWe also need to realize that not all musicians are good looking and are not going to have the same experience. My best friend and late guitarist John Rainey was a great guy with a beautiful personality. But he had a weight problem. He was very heavy set. At 360 Lbs women would still flirt with him and make advances. \nSo guys/women musicians  who do this, have no excuses to sexually assault anyone. We should be role models to the public.",

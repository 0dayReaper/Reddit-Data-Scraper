His record belies the short length of his tenure. In six months, Kelly eliminated guidelines that governed federal immigration agents' work; vastly expanded the categories of immigrants being targeted for deportation; threatened to abandon the Obama-era program that grants legal status to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children; and has even broached the idea of splitting up mothers and children at the border to \"deter\" people from coming to the U.S.\n\nThe short answer is, it may have upset him from an I Didn't Think the Leopard Would Eat MY Face perspective... but not because he has a heart for children, or any personal beliefs that don't align in lockstep with whomever is paying him.",

You\u2019d get into trouble and have to go through training again, but you\u2019re not getting thrown in prison for leaving a document in an island of security to take a piss. Maybe top secret and beyond there\u2019ll be harsher penalties but you\u2019re not getting thrown into prison that easily. There were many stories of people mishandling documents, the important part was it was never sinister, always mistakes AND THEY REPORTED IT OR BROUGHT IT BACK ASAP when they realized their mistake. \n\nHandling classified date was such a pain in the fucking ass though holy shit. Like you said you couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom without telling someone to watch over your document. Lock it in the locker at the end of the day. Take out beginning of the day. Couldn\u2019t discuss it with certain folks waiting on their clearance. Couldn\u2019t use it on regular intranet. Pain in the ass. If you took that shit home tho and they found out (they\u2019ll find out in a day) and they said bring it back and you didn\u2019t\u2026 yeah. Jail.

I was watching the news and the province is already on fire, like everywhere from north-east, to the south-central, and south-western parts.

The Canadian military and American firefighters had to be called upon to help with the situation.^[[3]](https://globalnews.ca/news/9744620/canadian-soldiers-american-firefighters-now-battling-blazes-in-nova-scotia/)\n\nThe mayor of Halifax, Nova Scotia had some choice words for a resident that was blow-torching dry leaves, stating that [\"it was a clear violation of the no-stupid policy if ever there is one.\"](https://youtube.com/shorts/N3G0m_p5jTg?feature=share)\n\nGoing back out west, Alberta has been dealing with some of the worst wildfires their province has seen. While the state of emergency has been lifted in recent days, the province is expecting more wild fires and smoke due to the hot, dry weather.^[[4]](https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/expected-hot-dry-summer-means-more-fire-smoke-coming-to-alberta-1.6430483)\n\nAnd in Quebec there are as many as 160 fires ablaze, with wildfire smoke affecting millions of people across North America.^[[5]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65828469)\n\nAnd we're only in the first week of June.",

And that + tight chest + anxiety triggered a migraine too so I had pain and migraine aura on top of it, scintillating and blind spots (I\u2019ve had it a few times before, it\u2019s one of my typical migraine symptom, but it\u2019s still scary).\n\nMade for a pretty weird day.",

It smells just like the burning scent that is part of my migraine auras recently and I ALSO have what seems like a migraine brewing now. Luckily for me I knew about the cause of the scent before the headache started but I know how scary that must have been for you. Health anxiety combined with knowledge of symptoms, combined with personal health issues, combined with external events and stressors is a bad combo. I hope your migraine stops soon and that you get some anxiety relief too. Take some time for yourself, if you are able to!",

You do not want those smoke particles in your lungs. This is true for anyone, not just asthmatics or elderly. Is especially important for children. Studies on young animals from the CA wildfires showed significant damage in development/maturation from particle damage.\n2. Stay indoors while the smoke haze persists. Keep kids and pets inside.\n3. If you must go outside, N95. No one wants to mask after the pandemic, but masking from smoke particulates is important.\n4. Do not exercise outdoors while the haze persists.\n\nHere in CA they cancel school PE/sports when the haze index is above 100.  Some of us think that's too high, because even 70 is noticeably bad.\n\nTLDR: Smoke particles bad. Mask/Stay inside",

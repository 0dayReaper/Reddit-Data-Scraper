I can confirm that the US military is still pushing this idiotic and archaic practice of wearing unbreathable/unsuitable clothing, not providing breaks or water, and sacrificing functionality in place of aesthetics/uniformity. Change of command, funerals, anniversaries, Retirements, civilian displays...\n\n\nMy worst memory of the Air Force is being forced to march in blues without a jacket or coat in 20F weather. We had 3 airman get severe hypothermia, 6 people slip over black ice, and once case of pneumonia. All this because of a Colonel's ego and beliefs that jackets/coats were unprofessional. \n\nIt's low on the priority list but we should all get past this military uniform dress code.",

This would require us to dig a lot of sand and the location selected was an old 1991 and 2003 Gulf War battlefield complete with UXOs ranging in size from rifle bullets up to 1,000 air dropped bombs. EOD said it was a bad idea and they would need several months to clear the area. My company commander said his combat engineers will do it in 3 weeks, then told them to do it in 3 days. I know there is at least 1 motor round inside a hesco wall that got lost in the sand when filling them. The battalion commander wanted this because he wanted to leave something there to be remembered by, but he spent the entire rotation in Saudi Arabia and not Kuwait.",

It's not there for someone's vanity or ego or pride.  It's there to show respect for every man and woman who, as Lincoln put it, gave their last full measure of devotion in sacrificing their lives for their country.  Being chosen to guard it is one of the highest honors imaginable, and being uncomfortable for a few hours is nothing compared to what they gave.  They aren't \"guarding nothing\", they are drawing attention to a symbol and an idea that absolutely deserves our attention and respect.",

US military has apropriate uniform for all weathers due to global preparedness, just let the Guard, guard on apropriate uniform for each weather. In summer heat light tropical uniform, in winter cold arctic cold uniform.\n\nAlso providing protective guard hut/head cover wouldn't probably be too disrespectful for the fallen.",

No one is told they \"must\" do anything.  And you are utterly missing the point.  If it was like every other post of guard duty, where they do what you describe, there would be nothing special about, nothing that acknowledges that this is something unique, and that the formality and tradition is what makes it stand out and draw attention.\n\nAnd you are completely ignorant of the climate in DC if you think you need tropical uniforms or arctic winter gear, like, ever, to make it through half an hour.",

We see 80% humidity and 95F (35C) regularly with plenty of days over 100F (38C) But we have the experience and infrastructure to deal with it.  It often forget that homes in other areas don\u2019t have air conditioning but it\u2019s standard here. \n\n\nI don\u2019t discount that folks in mild climates aren\u2019t used to the hotter weather but folks need to learn.  Climate change is coming to every place so folks have to get used to things being different.  Learning to dress properly is a huge part and the government that put troops out in uniforms designed for very different weather are to blame for this episode.",

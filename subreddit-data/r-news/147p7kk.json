While under contract he\u2019s still paid but of course he can\u2019t launch a competing show. Although he was \u201cfired\u201d, he\u2019s really just benched. They want him out of the spotlight long enough for people to forget about him. And they\u2019re willing to continue paying him/not claw back the pay he\u2019s already gotten and not willing to let him buy out his contract while he basically does nothing.",

The person above said rates to *cable providers*, meaning the per-person fee FOX charges DirecTV, Comcast, etc to carry their channel. It's well documented that FOX News has the highest cable channel cost and that they frequently raise it via convincing their audience to lobby their cable providers: when the cable providers try to negotiate the price down, FOX gets their viewers to call their cable companies and say they will cancel their cable plan if FOX doesn't get what it wants.\n\nIn effect this can raise the bill for everyone, not just FOX viewers. You're paying for that fee even if you never tune your cable to FOX's network.",

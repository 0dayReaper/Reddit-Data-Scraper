I bet the only way she talks freely is if she gets to walk free with a new identity and serious witness protection.\n\nThat's not going to happen though, because what's important for those in power is to make sure she talks, but only says the \"right\" things. She will therefore get some symbolic few years in a low security prison, in exchange for not naming any names and placing all blame on Epstein.",

But I'm hoping that this will continue and bring to light more evidence against those who have committed crimes. And I absolutely hate that politics has gotten brought into this. So many people will say trump did this or clinton did that... Well if they did, then charge them and convict. It doesn't matter (or shouldn't matter) who was involved. If they committed a crime, then they should go down for it.",

It's what happened to Epstein originally in the late 2000's. He got convicted and spent a year in a jail of his own making that he got to leave sometimes and employed his own guards. Then he went on to have his own pedophile island that was full of the wealthy and influential while they raped little girls.\n\nIt's sweet that you think the law will apply to these people. Maybe a few of them will get convicted if it blows up, but the inner circle, the true elite, will never be convicted. Laws don't apply to them because they make the laws. The system we live in is to the benefit of the very few. The people that Epstein and Maxwell constructed this for will never be convicted in a court of law. Period.",

It's downright disrespectful to the people who worked hard on this case to call it something that'll just be swept under the rug or that nothing will come of it.",

He got convicted and spent a year in a jail of his own making that he got to leave sometimes and employed his own guards. Then he went on to have his own pedophile island that was full of the wealthy and influential while they raped little girls.\n\nNot really. I mean, yes, Epstein got an extreme sweetheart deal, but no, it did NOT get swept under the rug. From the moment his deal became public, the victims were advocating to get it changed, and multiple national publications covered it. For example:\n\nhttps://nymag.com/news/features/41826/\n\n\nAnd, as a matter of fact, the entire reason people that weren't paying attention initially found out about this later is because of a big article from the [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html)  as a result of Trump nominating Acosta to his cabinet. In other words, this was never swept under the rug (at least insofar as the media were concerned), it just started being interesting to people after we were able to tie Epstein to Trump and the White House. \n\n&gt; It's sweet that you think the law will apply to these people.\n\nIt's interesting that you do not think it applies to them given that you reference Epstein facing (inadequate) justice the first time around and you know he died in prison awaiting trial and we're in a thread about his partner being charged. You can complain that it's not enough punishment, but stop pretending like they escaped justice completely.",

We all know Epstein had some MUCH bigger fish in his black book and if Maxwell can give up evidence to put away Trump or (im not sure of the evidence of) Clinton or any of the other big names, it might lead to a domino effect of destroying the sex trafficking's industry, since big money is what makes it tick. Once the sharks start eating each other, all you have to do is go collect the parts.",

They\u2019re just awful people and there are probably millions of them around the world. \n\nTaking down Maxwell and Epstein and their associates is like taking down Bernie Madoff - a high profile fraudster who certainly screwed over a lot of people. But him ending up in prison has practically zero impact on the millions of other fraudsters and scammers out there. It\u2019s scratching the surface of a much deeper issue.",

She pleaded not guilty to the original charges.\n\nThe new indictment also says Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell each encouraged the girl to recruit other young women to provide sexualized massages to Mr. Epstein.\n\nIn response, the indictment says, the girl brought multiple women and girls to provide erotic massages for Mr. Epstein, and both she and the person she recruited were paid hundreds of dollars in cash.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, hanged himself in his cell at a jail in Manhattan in August 2019, a month after his arrest on charges that he sexually exploited and abused dozens of girls and women at his mansion in Manhattan, his estate in Palm Beach, and other locations.",

It's in addition to previous charges which is why she is being held in jail. \n\nThe fact that there has been a new charge that just came out, means they are still investigating and gathering evidence and potentially will continue to have more charges. \n\nHere's a quick overview of the case: \n\nGhislaine Maxwell \u2014 SUPERCEDING INDICTMENT ISSUED\n\nA superseding indictment is an indictment that replaces a previous indictment. These indictments are filed when new evidence has been found and new charges need to be filed.\n\nLINK: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612.187.0_2.pdf\n\nThe Grand Jury charges:\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe charges set forth herein stem from the role of GHISLAI NE MAXWELL, the defendant , in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including at least in or about 2004 , MAXWELL assisted , facilitated , and contributed to Jeffrey Epstein' s abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18.\n\n\nCOUNT ONE\nConspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in\nIllegal Sex Acts\n\n\nCOUNT TWO \nEnticement of a Minor to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex Acts)\n\nCOUNT THREE\nConspiracy to Transport Minors with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity\n\nCOUNT FOUR\nTransportation of a Minor with Intent to\nEngage in Criminal Sexual Activity\n\nCOUNT FIVE\nSex Trafficking Conspiracy\n\nCOUNT SIX\nSex trafficking of a minor \n\nCOUNTS SEVEN &amp; EIGHT \nPerjury",

This is a new one in addition to the others.\n\nEdit: I'm going to copy and paste what I commented elsewhere: \n\nI've seen a lot of comments with people surprised that this is the only charge. It is not the only charge. It's in addition to previous charges which is why she is being held in jail. \n\nThe fact that there has been a new charge that just came out, means they are still investigating and gathering evidence and potentially will continue to have more charges. \n\nHere's a quick overview of the case: \n\nGhislaine Maxwell \u2014 SUPERCEDING INDICTMENT ISSUED\n\nA superseding indictment is an indictment that replaces a previous indictment. These indictments are filed when new evidence has been found and new charges need to be filed.\n\nLINK: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612/gov.uscourts.nysd.539612.187.0_2.pdf\n\nThe Grand Jury charges:\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe charges set forth herein stem from the role of GHISLAI NE MAXWELL, the defendant , in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including at least in or about 2004 , MAXWELL assisted , facilitated , and contributed to Jeffrey Epstein' s abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18.\n\nCOUNT ONE Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex Acts\n\nCOUNT TWO Enticement of a Minor to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex Acts)\n\nCOUNT THREE Conspiracy to Transport Minors with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity\n\nCOUNT FOUR Transportation of a Minor with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity\n\nCOUNT FIVE Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\n\nCOUNT SIX Sex trafficking of a minor \n\nCOUNTS SEVEN &amp; EIGHT Perjury",

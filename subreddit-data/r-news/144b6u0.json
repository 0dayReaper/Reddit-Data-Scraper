You know what they did? Fuck all. The state GOP ignored our SCOTUS until the election when--you guessed it--they increased their stranglehold on the court. Now it's moot.  \n\nJust flat-out ignored the law. The Republikkkan Way\u2122",

When there are multiple seats just use ranked choice voting and assign the top X winners to seats. Any method of districting is going to be subject to randomly impacting representation due to geography. It doesn't matter if it's non-partisan or even computer generated, at the end of the day it's going to be somewhat arbitrary. I can see an argument for state level representatives as they're dealing with local issues but at the federal level I can't imagine anything other than having the best representation for the state overall being the best outcome.",

The feds even had to threaten the use of military force (not law enforcement like the US Marshal Service, actual soldiers from the 101st Airborne) against civilians over it. \n\nPeople always pick and choose which SCOTUS decisions they feel like going along with. It's not like Northern abolitionists suddenly changed their minds after \\*Dred Scott\\*, and Harriet Tubman started shipping folks back.

Kavanaugh is a more \"moderate\" justice than expected to the chagrin of some GOP operatives. He tends to rule more in favor to the letter of the law but can be persuaded by logical arguments, minus some big cases like Roe v. Wade. \n\nGorsuch is also a \"moderate\" and is a student of Scalia's school of thought which is why he tends to rule in favor or pre-established laws that are pretty airtight. He has also upset some GOP operatives since he doesn't vote as conservatively as they wanted. Outside of the denial of Obama's appointee controversy he isn't too controversial, say compared to Barret, Thomas, or Kavanaugh. He is also known to side with Native Americans in regards to Native American rights due to his previous work in that sector and is vocal when the SCOTUS doesn't vote in favor or Native rights.",

The map is really 8-6 in favor of the GOP, but thankfully the most competitive seat is R+2 but is still in fairly moderate area, so it went Democratic in 2022. I really hope the map holds for the next election, because otherwise it'll just be another gerrymandered map that'll have to be fixed by 2026 or 2028, and then we'll have another census that will just require yet another map change. I'm pretty sure between 2010 and 2020, I switched between the old 7th, 8th, and 9th districts within 4 election cycles.",

But if *Sally* goes to the office, and talks about *her* wife, brings a picture of her wife, then the boss has an issue. So employers that discriminate against LGBT employees accept conduct with employees of one sex, but not the other, hence making it sex discrimination, and making it fall under Title VIII.\n\n**EDIT**: Edited the example used for better clarification, as comments below have pointed out.",

Most people don't talk about judges being originalist vs living constitutionalist which is usually a more accurate dichotomy and doesn't fit nearly exactly with liberal or conservative popular view points. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think politics can play a role in a judge's decision, but it isn't supposed to and, often times, does not.  Many decisions over the years have not aligned with what we know about that judge's politics but do tend to align with their philosophy on the constitution.  \n\nUnfortunately the way our govt works now, we hang so many things on court decisions that judges have way more power than they should.  Roe is a solid example.  Roe as an impact on society should be a law, not a court decision that can be overturned at any time. Our congress for decades failed to come to any sort of consensus so our judiciary branch has all the power.  Personally, I'm a pretty extreme your body do what you want person so I'd support broader laws than what the details of Roe were, but it needs to be voted on by congress, not just adjudicated.\n\nBoth the executive and legislative branches have been placing more and more responsibility on the courts rather than following the process so more and more of our rights are going to be able to be hand waived away when courts change and a lawyer finds the right argument.",

Highways were used to divide minority communities, absolutely, but the fact is that an existing highway will typically act as a separation between neighbourhoods or communities, and it's a continuous delineating marker that isn't easily subject to the whims of the map-maker.\n\nI'd be much less concerned about a district boundary that follows the curve of an existing highway than I would be about a district boundary that cuts across city blocks or makes turns at intersections, etc.  That's because gerrymandering typically seeks to pack one or two districts with an outsider group (in the US, typically blacks or Latinos), and then distribute others as an ineffectual minority elsewhere by subdividing their neighbourhoods into different regions by carving up the map like a turkey.\n\nMy suggestion of using real boundaries is simply an extension on the previous comment of using limited geometric shapes, as geometric shapes can be a bit slapdash when it comes to making sensible choices (for example, it could result in one or two homes at the edge of town randomly ending up in a different district because the road curves a bit).  The goal is still limiting the total delineating boundaries of districts to prevent gerrymandering, but making those boundaries more representative of community boundaries by having them follow paths that typically split up major geographical regions.",

Only the fact that by gerrymandering the districts, black Alabama residents were not getting fair representation. So the court agreed, there isn't fair representation because of how districts were drawn up. I didn't read anywhere that the court is specifically addressing the gerrymandering. Although, this ruling does force districts to be redrawn. That in itself doesn't mean there won't be gerrymandering. It just means there will be less of it; enough so that there is a 2nd district for black voters.",

There is one district that covers much of that area, and that district votes Democrat. The remainder of the heavily-Black  area is big enough on its own to make up a second district. But instead of drawing the map so that there are 2 districts in that huge, highly-populated area, they drew it so that there is one very large district and the 6 other districts each get a small piece of the remaining Black population. \n\nEssentially, there should be 7 or 8 districts, with 2 of them Black-majority districts. But the group went out of their way to ensure that as many Black votes as possible were swallowed up by majority-white districts. And that's what the supreme court called BS on.",

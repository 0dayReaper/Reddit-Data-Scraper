I do not disagree that the current methods for harvesting LAL aren\u2019t sustainable, but the ecological situation is *far* more complicated than NPR (an organization I support monthly and so should you!) would have you believe. I hate seeing incredibly complex situations being distilled down to foster doom scrolling.\n\nI spent a few years working on LAL, early on in my career. Went in a different direction for a variety of reasons. However, I work in a lab complex and one my neighbors is a leading researcher in the scale up and delivery of LAL alternatives. We are in the United States and they are having success! \n\nThe solution is coming, I promise you. Please don\u2019t feel down about this. This problem will be solved. Hell, it *has* been solved! Unfortunately it takes time. \n\nSource: long career in Pharmaceutical Sterile Manufacturing. I know most of the principle players in the industry. A little disappointed in NPR for the way they framed this up. But nobody\u2019s perfect.",

I only brought it up because people pretend that the FDA isn't the best organization worldwide at what it does.  \n\nI also mentioned it in another comment below, but when people look at the failure rates for drugs in clinical trials and claim it's because the FDA is too strict it shows how little they know about medicine. \n\nThe bar for getting a drug onto the market isn't that high when you think about it.  It needs to do 2 things, be safe (if it is unsafe they need to show why the benefits outweigh the risk) and work the same/better than a competitor drug if one exists on the market.  If your drug or treatment does both of those things you just need to do the test in a way that is standardized (so no one can fudge the data) and you will breeze through FDA approval.  The problem is that making good drugs is really fucking hard.  Most clinical trials fail because the drugs are hot garbage.",

The FDA isn't being unreasonable to not let trash on the market.  A free market for drugs isn't like one for shoes, people die if their drug is bad and desperate people will by bad drugs out of desperation if better ones don't work.

This is a blood test used for the 100\u2019s of millions of people on blood thinners (warfarin, Coumadin) for heart failure or other cardiovascular reasons.

Therefore, the quality control and guidance surrounding the standards of that quality control are relatively high (in comparison to non-injectable drugs). Lonza is a big company, one of the largest in the world - I guarantee you they are collaborating with US companies, inspection agencies, and Pharmacopia, to get this technology validated.",

Now there are many companies manufacturing rFC.\n\nBefore 2018 there was no way that pharmaceutical companies would want to take on the regulatory change process for switching from a tried and true, tightly regulated, 50 year old standard process to a new rFC based process when the supply of rFC was constrained to a single manufacturer. Sure, it would have been nice if the FDA allowed it as a drop on substitute, but it's understandable that they didn't.\n\nNow that it can be produced generically it's likely that the change will happen eventually, because rFC is cheaper and tangibly *better* (less false positives) than the real thing. It's just going to take time to switch over to it because it's an incredibly critical process and pharma is slow and conservative.",

There are still a fair concentration of them, but a lot less. You would see them all over the beaches and now it\u2019s markedly less so. \n\nOne issue is they bleed them a pretty good amount, and release them but don\u2019t know how many die after being released from trauma or predation - just estimates. On top of that, how it affects their reproductive cycle for that year. Lastly, many are often caught and bled again too soon and end up dying. This stuff is worth a ton of money, and we\u2019re definitely pushing the numbers down quite a bit since even just 10 years ago. \n\nThey may not be endangered yet, but with the rate the population is dropping, it will come. And since this product is tied to medical sterilization and is important (though there are suitable substitutes), we will keep bleeding them until regulation is in place.",

Most US drug manufacturers almost certainly want to switch to it, and their profits dwarf the profits of the companies that harvest the crabs, so this idea that  someone lobbied the FDA to block this just doesn't make any sense.\n\nRather, rFC was under an exclusive patent until ~2018. Only a single company, Lonza Bioscience, was manufacturing it globally.\n\nLAL testing is super critical to drug manufacturing. Manufacturers are free to switch to rFC if they want, they just have to go through an expensive and time consuming regulatory change process to prove and validate that the rFC testing is sufficient. Remember that LAL testing has been the standard for like 50 years, so it's a pretty big deal to change the process.\n\nThere is zero chance that drug manufacturers would want to bother switching to rFC when it's entire global supply and cost was constrained to a single manufacturer. It just isn't a sane business decision to do that.\n\nNow that rFC is being manufactured by multiple companies it's pretty likely that we'll see movement in US pharma companies eventually, but it's super slow, careful, and conservative, like everything in pharma.",

If our society changes so that we cant see the value of any life form simply living their life with \"a right to not be tortured for science\", we have lost the humane part of our nature.\n\nBecause a creature cannot speak is not sufficient to deny the creature its life.\n\nHumanity must evolve to embrace this view, or we will not only doom everything else, but ourselves as well.  \n\nWe are not merely apex predators that must consume/dominate/destiry everything.  We also have a capacity to nurture and assist life.",

This means that for drug testing purposes it has to be validated as a separate product entirely and proven on its own merits, vs simply switching to it and assuming that it behaves exactly like real horseshoe crab blood. This obviously takes a huge amount of time and effort.\n\nGiven how relatively new it is, it's really likely that the delay in switching to it in the US is just a byproduct of how slow and conservative drug testing and approval is in general.",

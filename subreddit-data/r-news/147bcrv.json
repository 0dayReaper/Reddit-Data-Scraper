He appeared on Anthony Bourdain\u2019s television show, \u201cParts Unknown\u201d in 2014. \n\n&gt;\u201c[The] band wasn\u2019t that famous but Travis and his friends had been very vocal about freedom of speech and state oppression in Russia,\u201d the episode\u2019s producer Darya Tarasova told CNN. \n\n&gt;\u201cTravis was a showman \u2013 very articulate and he loved Russia,\u201d Tarasova said. \u201cBands from the Moscow rock scene would go to him to write songs in English for them and proofread their lyrics.\u201d \n\n&gt;Tarasova told CNN that she did not believe that Leake had committed the crimes he has been accused of. \n\n&gt;\u201cHe is an American in Russia and is very aware of the situation he\u2019s in,\u201d she said. \n\n&gt;When Leake was arrested, he allegedly told police, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m here. I don\u2019t admit guilt, I don\u2019t believe I could have done what I\u2019m accused of because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m accused of,\u201d according to Russian television network Ren TV. \n\nIt sounds more like he is someone who likes russia. Doesn't make him a 'russian' as if that is somehow a negative on its own. Nor does it automatically define him as guilty. \n\nYes, in russia there is no 'innocence til proven'... but that does not mean he is guilty just because some authoritarians say so. \n\nBut it makes you seem pretty fucking weak, just taking the russian cops words for it over an american paratrooper. But hey, you are probably russian, so...",

That doesn\u2019t make me part of a world police that needs to go to other countries and interfere with their governments. Once you\u2019ve been in a place over a decade, where are you really from? This guy having been a paratrooper doesn\u2019t mean shit, I\u2019m not sure who that argument is useful on - morons, maybe. \n\nThis trope about spreading democracy is stupid as hell and insists that\u2019s an individual\u2019s role in a foreign country. \n\nYou really think that\u2019s a legit cover? You\u2019ve seen way too many movies.\n\nIt\u2019s more likely this guy is just a dude who likes music and being Russian, but happens to have American credentials so Russia is going to do their best to make a story out of him. It\u2019s unfortunate, but staying in Russia for over a decade was his choice.",

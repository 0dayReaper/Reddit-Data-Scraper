Population back then was 153 million, population today is 340 million... This is going to see the US importing wheat from eastern Europe (possible Ukraine.) It will then be imported into Kansas for processing, and then distributed like normal.\n\nIt will be interesting to see just how high the price of wheat will go. Perhaps we'll accept payment from Ukraine, on the Lend Lease equipment, in the form of wheat.",

The record high prices for wheat were enough incentive to try to get as much as possible. The USDA projected this year US farmers are abandoning around 1/3 of their wheat crops because the drought is worse.\n\nEdit: Last year for Kansas (Pdf warning): https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Kansas/Publications/Crops_Releases/Crop_Production/2022/KS-croppr2207.pdf\n\n&gt;MANHATTAN, Kan.

It doesn't have the nickname poverty grass because folks make good money on it.\n\nEdit since this reply isn't visible: \n\n&gt;We grow a lot winter wheat east of the Mississippi. Almost every corn field is a wheat field come spring, but more importantly wheat is not poverty grass considering it's the most expensive grain that has been traditionally available to Americans.\n\n&gt;Poverty grass is actually a type of oatgrass. \n\nThe acres east of the Mississippi are fairly local to an end use like a brewery. \n\n\nIt's nicknamed poverty grass because a good year sees a return in the $10-20/ac range, alright and bad years you are likely negative even with subsidy. UMN projects $16/ac on spring wheat this year, university of Illinois projected $15/ac last year for winter wheat. Corn and beans are north of $100/ac.",

I've never had to water the garlic, no matter how dry of a spring.  This year, our garlic all died.  I think because we had such a dry spring.  It never occurred to me I should water it, I literally never have.\n\nAlso, my kale is still going strong.  This time of year it's normally covered in cabbage moth larvae.  Nothing.  I've seen one cabbage moth all year fluttering around the garden.  Just one.  I mean, I appreciate that my kale is still pristine but it's not normal.\n\nWorking in a garden for so many years, you start noticing the patterns or lack of them.   \n These observations have been making me increasingly uncomfortable.",

Most of this gluten intolerance (at least when you test celiac neg) is just over engineered grain intolerance. We pay more for gluten free to just swap one over engineered grain for another with minimal improvement. We need a new category, modern grain intolerance. And a new rule if you hybridize until what you grow produces seeds that cannot sprout and grow a new crop, you went too far.",

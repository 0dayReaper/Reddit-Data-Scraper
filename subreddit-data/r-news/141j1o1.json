The aircraft continued flying on autopilot until it ran out of fuel and crashed into a field near Mina, South Dakota.\n\nKind of wild that it managed to get all the way to South Dakota from Florida before it crashed.",

Payne Stewart was really prominent at the time, he dressed in old-style golf attire in bright colors which really stood out on the tour. \n\nThe plane was unresponsive for a long time, they had video of it while it was happening. News outlets were telling us that everyone was dead long before it crashed, they told us that the first jet to intercept the airplane could see ice on the inside of the windows. It was really sad just waiting for it to crash.",

As the plane approached Athens, the Greek air force scrambled interceptors. They flew close enough to see unconscious passengers and the flight crew slumped over, then circled the still-proceeding jet for almost half an hour, looking for signs of life.\n\nEventually, they saw two flight attendants (who had briefly awakened and gotten to portable oxygen, and one of whom had limited pilot training) enter the cockpit and try to regain control of the aircraft - but the engines ran out of fuel seconds later. \n\nThe only thing the flight attendants could do was wave to the interceptors and bank the plane to crash into a rural area away from Athens.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_Airways_Flight_522",

He didn\u2019t wave either, only pointed down when the f-16 pilot motioned for him to follow the fighter jet to the airport. The turning was due to the engines shutting off unevenly on each side.

Either way, yes, you can over time adapt to altitudes higher than 10000 feet but it takes time for your body to up your red blood cells and adapt.  In the meantime you can suffer hypoxia which folks would say is \"altitude sickness\".",

It looks like it was on and tight within 2 or 3 seconds but that doesn't include the surprise factor.",

So by the time it hits the ground it may hit at a shallow angle and low speed to attempt a crash landing, maybe 45 degrees at the worst, but maybe less. \n\nIn this case, no one was in control of the plane. It dropped like a stone from 34,000 feet with no one to control it. Like the golfer whose private plane went down the same way, this one probably ended up coming down at a sharp near vertical angle at a higher than normal speed. That golfer\u2019s plane fell from a similar height and hit the ground at a near 90 degree angle at near supersonic speeds (around 700ish mph)",

The engine runs off of the fuel but the instruments and computers are turned on and off separately via the battery.

So I guess they would still run after a loss of fuel, but only until the battery is drained, like a car.",

They put a LOT of effort into it. Real airline pilots actually play it in their off time and say it\u2019s pretty well done. You actually need to use the same type of flight path docs and runway lineups/approaches that real pilots use. And the data and weather in the game is real time. The game has guided options - no aids for the real nerds and also pre-setup scenarios for new players. For example if you\u2019re not good at takeoff and landings you can set it up to start in the air and just do that part. Graphics are amazing but you need a good pc to play it well. I got it back when it came out and it\u2019s been a while so I don\u2019t know what changed - back then when it came up, the game was more demanding than the tech at the time so it was actually impossible to play it maxed out with over 100 fps. But that was before the nvidia 4 series cards. \n\nOther than that you have games like ace combat and war thunder which are more arcade style games. \n\nDigital Combat simulator (dcs) is for fighter planes specifically. It is INCREDIBLY detailed and realistic but because of that, extremely hard. Makes flight sim look basic. There was a guy streaming playing that game. He\u2019d been playing for months and already had sim experience but even after months was stuck on the same scenario of trying to land a plane and couldn\u2019t do it without crashing.",

I got really deep into it and will probably show up on /r/theydidthemath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:** All data is as-reported by ADSB-Exchange, and does not include all time intervals of reported data, as there were sometimes single second timeframes with multiple data reports, and that data's hard to calculate. The middle block is spread out where it appears the aircraft hit its steepest descent rate and then under such speed encountered some semblence of lift.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe aircraft's reported rate of descent (left column) also seems to max out at 30,016 feet per minute, and so I used the actual reported altitudes at intervals and calculated an actual rate-of-descent (right column). Again, this is all just extrapolating off of data and the reported rates of descent, altitudes, speeds, it's all just ADSB spitting out what the computer's reading and may not be accurate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, 60,000 fpm is 681.8 mph (1,097 km/h, Mach 0.896).

If one spooled down before the other, it would induce a yaw rate, and majority of A/P are not equipped to counteract yaw (not connected to the rudder). \n\nAs both engines flame-out, the A/P would attempt to maintain the pre-select altitude and would pitch the aircraft nose up until the aircraft stalls. With a yawing motion and stall, the aircraft would enter a spin, which the A/P is incapable of recovering from. \n\nHighly doubt the aircraft was \u201chauling ass\u201d at impact but was most likely falling out of the sky a a few thousand feet per minute.",

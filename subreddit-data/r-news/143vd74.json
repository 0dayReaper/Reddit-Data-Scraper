Hamtramck has a large Yemeni and Bangladeshi population and Dearborn has the largest Muslim population in the US so the food is the real deal.",

These areas are *wild* and unpopulated. To burn this intensely reflects a physical tipping point rather than a failure of policy.\n\nSo, unfortunately, Canada probably can't do much to avoid a repeat.",

The claim was that we've been putting out fires there for decades to save the millions of homes in the area and building up dead brush that would normally have been cleared.\n\nThis was a deflection from climate change questions.\n\nIn the Yukon that excuse doesn't work. There aren't millions of homes. We haven't been suppressing all fires to save homes and building up fuel. It's climate change for sure.",

But it's also forest and grassland management because the areas that are burning are not that remote as you seem to imagine, and are in fact managed.  Forestry is a huge industry, and the grasslands are farmed.\n\nYou might be surprised to know that it was also highly managed by the indigenous peoples, and since their exclusion as a culture from the decisions, that has played a role too in the outcomes.",

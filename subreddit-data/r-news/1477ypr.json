I watched him play for 5 and a half hours in the sweltering heat in Melbourne he just doesn't drop in effort \n\nI know there are 100% clean genetically superior freaks of nature like Michael Phelps but I've always felt there's something off about Novax. I believe Federer and at times Nadal were both better tennis players than him but his endurance and stamina is what got him a lot of his titles over them and  he displays subtle facial expressions and indications of stimulant usage like pin point pupils during day games, most easily seem when the camera is straight in him receive serve",

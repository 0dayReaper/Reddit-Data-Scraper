He had the air gun and I was holding the nut with a wrench so he could loosen the bolts.  \n  \n  One of the bolts got stuck and twisted the wrench I was holding and smashed my finger, so I just yelled out in pain as a normal human reaction, no big deal.  \n  \n  When I look over, his whole face is red and he looks absolutely insane. For about one second I thought he got hurt too, but then he grabbed me by the shirt and hung me off the edge of the crusher.  \n  \n  I spend about 30 seconds navigating a conversation to try to reason with an absolute maniac not to send me to the hospital for nothing.  \n  \n  Turns out, when I got hurt I yelled \"fuck\", and he interpreted that as me attacking him, or blaming him for me getting hurt, and his thought process was that he was ready to possibly kill me just for this random misunderstanding, and if I had not been calm and collected, it would have escalated within seconds.  \n  \n  A couple more of those situations went down, and even though the job paid a lot, my life is worth more.",

The only injury I actually took was unintentional, and I'd have been over it within a few seconds if he hadn't lost his shit.  \n  \n  So, calling the police does what? He'd have an interview, deny it, lie and say he was \"just playing\" and I \"took it the wrong way\", the cops leave, and then I'm back to being left alone with the maniac.  \n  \n  Like, of all the places to make an enemy who would murder you, a concrete crusher is the last place you wanna be fighting at.  \n  \n  Altho an epic fight on a concrete crusher would be a good finale to some Demolition Man style 90s action movie.",

A conflict at work?\u201d\n\nSomething I saw on Twitter a while ago continues to stick with me: guns turn every confrontation fatal. \n\nI don't know the original source but it's just so true. When you introduce a gun into a conflict (regardless of who has the gun), it turns mortal. Regardless of who was in the right or wrong in this conflict, one is dead and the other's life is potentially ruined. 2 families are forever impacted. All because one of them brought a gun to a workplace disagreement.",

Someone tried to open a Chinese returant in the building but locals didn't eat there so it closed. They tried to open a bank there but locals didn't like the building so it closed. They finally knocked the building down.\n\nBut for 30 years people joked about the death. 30 years my town cracked joke about a murder so violent that we refused to use the building. It's just human nature to try to process terrible things with jokes... it doesn't mean people don't care and it doesn't mean we are heading towards doom.

At least not important enough for us to make sacrifices in order to value them appropriately. If anything, we put more value on human life now than we ever have in history. At least we don't have a world economy completely built off slave labor, and depending on where you live you may have actual rights. Go read up on the victorian era and see how it compares to today, or even go back to the medieval era as well and do some comparisons.

Then, when you die, the government can have half of what's left. Then they say, if you *really* loved grandma, you'd get her a nice box. \"It's only money,\" says the people with more money than you. \n\nThey don't want you to not have a kid you cannot afford or just don't want, so he'll have a shit homelife that leads to prison. People make money off of you going to prison. Where you are underfed to the point of health issues. Do they help with these? Fuck no, there's no money to be had. We *charge* people rent to stay in prison. Do you know what happens to the people who are barred from the majority of jobs when they (surprise surprise) can't pay back their debt? They go back to fucking prison. \n\nDo you know what happens if a cop gets pissed? They'll steal your car, shoot your dog, and find a gram of weed and off to prison you go. They don't give a fuck if you're innocent or deserve jail. They'll fight tooth and nail to prove they were right, hiding or forging evidence so you stay in prison. And if you get super lucky, they might let you out. Next week. My glorious state can decide to just not pay you the money they owe for jailing an innocent person. Just one big extra fuck you on the way out.\n\nDo the evil people get in trouble for any of this? Nope. Raises and promotions all around.",

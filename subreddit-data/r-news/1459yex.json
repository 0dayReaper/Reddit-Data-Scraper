At the very least it shouldn\u2019t make the states equal, it should be somewhat balanced for population. \n\nRanked choice also isn\u2019t as nice as it might sound. It removes the spoiler effect yes, but it can make it less likely for third parties to enter the scene. One of the US\u2019s problems is that they\u2019re stuck in a two party mentality. Proportional Representation like MMP would be a better choice (and the local candidates could be chosen by ranked ballot if you prefer). \n\nBribery should be illegal, yes. But lobbying as a whole is simply advocating politicians to do anything. Writing to your representative to voice your opinion is also lobbying. That\u2019s a necessary part of the democratic process. \n\nGerrymandering *should* be simple to solve, Canada did it ages ago, but it seems like the US does elections a bit weirdly. See, in Canada, provincial elections are done provincially, and federal elections are done federally. Only the federal government handles federal elections, and vice versa for provinces. Thus, the *federal government* set laws for how our *federal* elections are run, and all districts are made by independent non partisan committees. You can look at our electoral map to see they\u2019re usually fairly uniform. However apparently the US decided *states* should run *federal* elections, for some reason. Once that\u2019s fixed the gerrymandering issue could disappear the next day",

The general rule is that adverse rulings are not a ground for a judge to recuse, and that\u2019s how Judge Cannon would view such a motion, as opposed to viewing it as one based on extreme bias in favor of the defense.  Maybe she\u2019d do the right thing and recuse, but I doubt it.  More likely, the DOJ would have to appeal the denial of the motion, and despite cases like _U.S. v. Martin_, getting such a ruling overturned is actually quite rare (I\u2019d also note in that case, the judge had a history of imposing extreme downward departure sentences, so there was a pattern of bias in favor of defendants, as opposed to a single instance; additionally, that case was about reassignment on remand, not recusal, so it\u2019s a bit of an apples to oranges comparison).  I\u2019m not so sure I agree with the assessment that \u201cthe 11th circuit won\u2019t tolerate the damage it would do to their credibility.\u201d  It\u2019s not up to the 11th circuit at large, but rather whatever three judge panel gets the case.  The right (or wrong, depending on how you look at it) panel may very well view this is as an \u201cadverse ruling\u201d case and affirm.  I\u2019d also note that the 11th circuit is comprised entirely of conservative southern states, and while there are some Obama and Clinton judges, it is mostly Bush and Trump appointees, with Trump appointees having a plurality.  Oh, and who is the supervising Supreme Court Justice in the event of an emergency appeal to SCOTUS?  Oh, that\u2019s right, Clarence Thomas.  I just don\u2019t see \u201ccredibility\u201d being a factor here.\n\nI hope I\u2019m wrong in all of this, but if Judge Cannon remains the assigned judge, DOJ may be better off just dealing with it as best they can rather than fighting over her recusal.  It really makes me question why the case was filed here when, at least to the best of my understanding, venue and jurisdiction would have lied in D.C. as well.\n\nEdit:  The lack of nuance and some of the spelling and grammatical choices made by the Twitter commenter make me question whether they\u2019re even a lawyer, let alone a former appellate chief of a firm or U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nEdit 2:  Oh, the commenter is Joyce Vance.  She was indeed a bureau chief for a U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.  I stand corrected on that part.  Makes the tweet all the stranger though, considering her expertise.\n\nEdit 3:  Is it a \u201cthing\u201d for people to make a scathing reply to your post, then immediately delete it, so that only you see the post in your email but no one else sees it?

The judge\u2019s cited reason would not have required recusal.\n\nAs for this case, we\u2019re in uncharted territory.  The best we can look to is examples from state level courts where governors or governors\u2019 staffs or politicians of specific parties have been tried for crimes.  Typically, in those instances, the judge\u2019s appointing executive is not grounds for a recusal on either side.\n\nFlipping the coin a bit, would we feel differently of a Biden appointed judge got the case (of which there is one on the 11th circuit)?  If Trump moved to recuse because of who appointed the judge, we\u2019d call bullshit.  But then we have a slippery slope.  Who can be the judge presiding over the case of a former president?  A judge appointed by the president?  Surely not say some!  A judge appointed by his political adversary?  No, say others.  A judge appointed by a president of the same party?  Bias, they cry.  A judge appointed by a president of a different party?  Witch hunt!  See the problem?  Who is left to preside over a federal criminal case involving the president?\n\nThis is supposed to work because judges are supposed to be politically neutral.  Of course, most, even many (hell, maybe all) are not, in which case we have the exact problem you identify.  We wish we could trust judges in spite of who appointed them, or which way they lean politically.  History has shown that to be foolish.",

Kind of: 'we'll pick the time, you can pick the place and we'll still win.\"",

That motion doesn\u2019t go to Cannon, it goes to the 11th circuit panel.  And, this is only if she is permanently assigned to the case, which she is currently not so assigned.  Trump plurality or not, the 11th circuit cares about its credibility and the appearance of stacking the deck in a specific persons favor does not help it.  The DOJ would absolutely be granted a reassignment, even under far less obvious circumstances. The judges don\u2019t owe Trump anything, and showing favoritism could subject them to further scrutiny as it pertains to their relationships/dealings with the defendant. It\u2019s a trap.",

There are few things that would bypass the district and go straight to the circuit, but you could be right.\n\nEdit:  So sorry, but I think you may be incorrect.  A motion for reassignment would come up in the 11th circuit only as part of an appeal.  For example, if the U.S. appealed an adverse ruling to the circuit from the district, in the event it wins reversal, the U.S. could ask for reassignment to a different judge on remand.\n\nI\u2019m not seeing anything showing that a motion to reassign would simply bypass the district court; in this context, it would have to be a motion to recuse which Judge Cannon would rule on first.  If you can point me to something I\u2019m missing, I\u2019d be happy to take a look.  In the meantime, I think I\u2019ll stand by my initial analysis here, as bleak as it may seem.",

They used to hide their treason, class-warfare and racism under thinly-veiled bullshit like renaming their treason to \"war of northern aggression\" or \"states rights\".\n\nThey began to tear off the veils under the Gingrich revolution, and it didn't get them killed. Instead it gave them more power and shifted the Overton window even harder right. When Trump came to power they stopped all pretense whatsoever and began **violently** going fo the power-grab, as they'd always intended to.\n\nIt was always going to end violently, because violence against 'others' has always been their goal.",

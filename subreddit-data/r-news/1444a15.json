He apparently didn't have any reported criminal background or known psychological issues, so I wouldn't be ashamed for your country. 19 years without reportedly having any issue, is a long time. It's horrible, but as we've seen forever, people of all different backgrounds commit horrible crimes. It's not always something that's predictable",

You jumped in with a narrative, while ignoring all the media coverage that differs from your view.\n\nI'd suggest reading about terrorism in Europe. Muslim jihad terrorist attacks often result in larger casualties, which receives more media coverage (rightfully so); however, the number of their attacks, both realized and foiled, is less than left-wing extrmist, ethno-separatists or rightwing extremist. Last 3 years, left-wing extremist groups committed more attacks than Muslim-jihadist groups. More Muslims are often arrested, as a group, for plotting terror attacks. Basically, people throwing around \"90% of terrorist attacks or groups are Muslim\" simply is incorrect.\n\nhttps://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Tesat_Report_2022_0.pdf",

Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe \u2014 an account signaling a major escalation in the various investigations into the final stages of his presidency.\n\n&gt; The search, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, when he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents.\n\n&gt; Mr. Trump delayed returning 15 boxes of material requested by officials with the National Archives for many months, only doing so when there became a threat of action to retrieve them. The case was referred to the Justice Department by the archives early this year.\n\n\u2026\n\n&gt; The F.B.I. would have needed to convince a judge that it had probable cause that a crime had been committed, and that agents might find evidence at Mar-a-Lago, to get a search warrant. Proceeding with a search on a former president\u2019s home would almost surely have required sign-off from top officials at the bureau and the Justice Department.\n\nSource (soft paywall)\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/08/08/us/trump-fbi-raid\n\nSo I know a president can declassify stuff but he\u2019s not been the president for over a year and a half and still had classified files in his \u201cprivate \u201chome?  That\u2019s bad. Really bad. Hopefully it\u2019s enough to get him in custody so the real investigation can begin.\n\nEDIT: we aren\u2019t sure (yet) if he still had classified docs in his Mar a Lago residence but he had previously returned several boxes to the national archives a year after leaving office.  There must have been a damn good reason for that warrant though, considering the precedent and gravity of the situation. I hope we find out soon so this nightmare can begin resolution.",

A White House official said it was not notified about the search.\nCNN has reached out to the FBI for comment.\n\n&gt; The Justice Department has two known active investigations connected to the former President, one on the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and January 6, 2021, and the other involving the handling of classified documents.\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort -- including some that were classified.\n\n&gt; In April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter.  \n&gt; **This story is breaking and will be updated.**",

Maybe because our previous presidents weren't working against the country for personal gain in 500 different ways. \n\nAbsolutely shameless.

The good news is that if they find evidence of other crimes in the search they can use that.\n\nInitially the National Archives was issued a subpoenaed for the 15 boxes. That resulted in confirmation that stuff was still missing and not returned by Trump.\n\n5:55 MSNBC also reports that it is about the National Archives documents. DOJ probably had documents not returned as required. Trump probably said \"talk to the hand\" re their return. Perhaps they were secret or top secret? No one knows for certain.\n\n6:10 CNN Andrew McCabe said security at MAL was in all likely hood notified at the last possible moment.  (This had to piss Trump off, my guess is that he had a backup plan in place for the possibility that there would be a search.)",

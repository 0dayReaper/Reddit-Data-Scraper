She knocked.\n\nAnd the mother was shot through a fucking door that had a ring camera on it.\n\nShe wasn't standing her ground. This shit was premeditated.",

Shooting through a door is also not allowed, especially when you hit the wrong person!\n\nWe have what's called a \"heat of passion\" defense, which essentially means \"you had this shit coming, but D was out of line.\" It's what happens when there's provocation. Even if you want to say her kids provoked her, which they absolutely did not, she still didn't shoot the provocateur! You can't claim self defense against the person who was never an aggressor!\n\nEverything about this is wrong. Stand your ground doesn't explain this. This is just a corrupt, local police and prosecutors office who don't want to pursue this.

I hate Florida every time I learn something new about it. \n\nAnyway, let me do the lawyer gimmick.\n\nIt says, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n&gt; A law enforcement agency may use standard procedures for investigating the use or threatened use of force as described in subsection (1), but the agency may not arrest the person for using or threatening to use force unless it determines that there is probable cause that the force that was used or threatened was unlawful.\n\n&gt; The court shall award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, court costs, compensation for loss of income, and all expenses incurred by the defendant in defense of any civil action brought by a plaintiff if the court finds that the defendant is immune from prosecution as provided in subsection (1).\n\n&gt; In a criminal prosecution, once a prima facie claim of self-defense immunity from criminal prosecution has been raised by the defendant at a pretrial immunity hearing, the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence is on the party seeking to overcome the immunity from criminal prosecution provided in subsection (1).\n\nI had to really change the formatting so reddit wouldn't go crazy trying to figure out if this is a list or a quote or both. \n\nWith that out the way, they just need probable cause. I cannot express to you how low a bar that is. I also am screaming right now cause I've seen so many cops stretch the barest facts to say they had probable cause. Yet, this bitch yells the N word and shoots through a KNOCKED UPON A DOOR, LIKE DOORS ARE FUCKING MEANT FOR, and you got these jackass fucking pigs saying they can't do anything?\n\nI hate everyone and everything. Yes, I may have had a long day at work.\n\nAnyway, the \"stick,\" if you will, for not doing this correctly is just a god damned civil suit! Further, the defendant has to assert the defense first, and the CA can rebutt it, you ass hats! I hate these cops so much. I've never met them and I hate them. \n\nThe specific type of lawyer I am is a public defender, and this just trips all my triggers.",

Part of what I learned in therapy was to not be such a dick about taking a compliment. Still feels weird. \n\nUsually, what you're seeing is attorneys on the court appointed list. People don't normally do criminal work pro bono unless their nephew fucked up. The various states have a million ways to handle indigent defense. Some don't have public defenders. They just farm it all out to the private bar. \n\nIn virginia, in most jurisdictions of any significant size, and many that aren't, we have PD offices. They're supposed to get all court appointed cases except for conflicts. Conflicts go to the court appointed list, i.e. local lawyers who are willing to take court appointed work. The pay is shit, but the private bar that does court appointed work makes their money on volume. You also don't get paid till the case finishes. \n\nGet where I'm going? A lot of clients who claim to hate Public defenders never had one. They had a court appointed, private attorney. Some of those are great. Some are only interested in you as a check. They'll put in the bare minimum on your case, ignore their clients, and generally try to deal cases out no matter what. I know one guy who'd plead a double jeopardy claim into 5 years if it meant avoiding a motions hearing. \n\nSorry, I'm high. I didn't mean to trauma dump on you.",

One thing that could be done is to prosecute these people in these situations, just like the person in the article. Actually prosecute these people like the law literally states, and maybe it would make others more aware. Obviously it wouldn\u2019t get to everyone but at least it\u2019s something, because right now we\u2019re doing nothing. Start coming down on these people hard.",

Hell, when I was just a college kid, I went to court to dispute a speeding ticket.  \n\nTo prepare, I dove into the law books and got help from a friend. Together, we constructed a viable (but very flawed) defense based upon *prima facie* speed limits allowed on different roadway categories. \n\nI murdered all the Latin, but quoted directly from the vehicle codes. I even cited a statute rendering the officer \"incompetent to enter testimony\" after a technical blunder involving the use of his radar.  \n\nThat profoundly fumbled attempt at a *pro se* defense let me witness two patrol officers in the back of the traffic court *TAKING NOTES* on my argument.  \n\nThey didn't know the very vehicle codes they enforced, beyond citations for speeding, running a stop sign, etc.  \n\nEpilogue: I was indeed guilty. The highway patrol officer who cited me actually showed up, so I didn't just get a default judgment. After I exited out the double-doors, I found him doubled-over in laughter about 1) my *audacity*, and 2) those traffic cops taking notes.",

Extremely, extremely lazy. I have met less than a bakersdozen who I somewhat respect. I know one state trooper who seems to not give a single fuck about whether his cases win or lose. If he finds out something about my client he thinks i should know, he tells me. If he finds out exculpatory info, he tells me and also tells me he told the prosecutor.

Simply, being in someone house unauthroized is enough. In fact there is a famous old case where a police officer forced entry and the guy shot him, the judge in the original case denied him the self-defense defense, so it went up to the Supreme court who stated that he did have that right. That guy was retried with that affirmative self defense claim, and found not guilty.\n\nPoint being, yes simply being in someomes house is enough in some states, including refusing to leave even if you were invited in. It is governed under castle defense doctrine.",

The defendant needs to put some evidence in to show they had reason to think this was an unlawful, attempted entry. Doors are made for knocking and we have witnesses saying that's what she was doing. I'm sure V says different, but that's called a jury question. \n\nWe both agree there. The facts of the case at bar don't come close to meeting the burden. The cops are on some shit.",

Owens was shot through the door.\n\n&gt; At least two of Owens\u2019 four children may have witnessed the shooting, which occurred about 9 p.m.\n\nSo basically, any self defense theory is already in question. I'm going to throw what I think happened out there: The shooter is a racist shitbag, constantly throwing abuse at the kids, and the mother constantly tells her to stop. The racist shitbag went on another racist tirade, likely scaring the kids, causing them to run off, and one of them to leave an ipad behind. The racist shitbag then stole the ipad, and when the kids came back, she assaulted one by throwing it at them, whether she meant for it to hit them or not. When the mother went to confront the racist shitbag, said racist shitbag shot her through the door.\n\nI hope the racist shitbag spends the rest of her life in prison.",

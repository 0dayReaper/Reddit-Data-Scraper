I mean, fucking hell, most third world countries don't have so many mass shootings. Your statements are so unbelievably false and so demonstrably false that it borders on incomprehensible that somebody would actually argue this.\n\nThe ONLY reports that have tried to argue that America isn't the leader of the world in mass shootings was that stupid as fuck report by CRPC, the pro-gun association created literally to attempt to provide legitimacy to usa's insanely lax gun management (it's not even control at this point), where they cherry picked the data so hard and fudged the numbers so much that a country with ONE mass shooting was somehow worse than the hundreds upon hundreds of mass shootings in the USA because they just excluded a large portion of America's mass shootings.\n\n\"Well, when you calculate as a percentage of population, and exclude incidents where the shooter only killed 3 people instead of 5, and only record based on deaths and not woundings, then America is doing great! All this media is just those evil liberals trying to take away your guns because every country is Europe is just like America, they just don't report it unless the number is big.\"\n\nNo, that's not how it fucking is. America's gun deaths are so astronomically high that no other country comes even withing a fraction of a fraction of America's numbers. No other 1st world country comes close.\n\nDamn well near every metric not funded by American pro-gun think-tanks puts America so far above and beyond every single other first world country that you have to combine them. Multiple times over. To even get remotely close to america' s numbers.\n\nAmerica counts mass shootings by the week while other countries do it by the decade. It's not even remotely close.",

The chakras they talk about are just nerve centers, and the energy movement is just a good mental analogy for the type of stimulation you need to do. \n\nWe'd probably know a good deal more about this if organized religion wasn't so prudish.

Even with years of therapy I still felt \u201cheartless\u201d and only bitter pain with anger as emotionally I seemed to still be losing myself. I discovered about 2 years ago that when I was orgasming I could for one microsecond feel maybe something just slightly positive in my heart region. I know this is incredibly TMI,  but in the exact second after I would try and follow that sensation in my body to the exact point and in that point was the most unimaginably painful emotional pain you could imagine. I\u2019ve been doing that frequently the past year or two and after each time I noticed I could get maybe just slightly \u201cdeeper\u201d and come back out feeling more like my old unbroken self. I\u2019m to the point now where I\u2019m actually starting to feel positive emotions in normal everyday life. My take is the dopamine and oxytocin released at the time are letting me brute force my brain pertaining to my trauma, letting me slowly unlock those neurons that are suck 18 years in the past in a PTSD state. So I\u2019m not sure what exactly these people are doing, but to me it seems there might be some truth to healing through trauma this way.",

If this book isn\u2019t on your radar, please look it up and read the description and consider giving it a read. It\u2019s legitimately life changing.\n\nIf you can manage the therapy without incurring significant cost, absolutely do it. But from what I understand, the current state of the industry is focused more around profit generation.\n\nI started down this path because of other manifestations of my PTSD that periodic large doses of psilocybin help with (Heightened autonomic response on interpersonal contact; I don\u2019t like to be touched or touch others.) but microdosing has been affording me an emotional availability that I didn\u2019t know was possible previously. I\u2019m not cured, by any means. And I still spend a lot of time\u2026 just not happy. But I can do little things like have a genuine chuckle when I\u2019m playing video games with my son now. I actually feel like I\u2019m making progress for the first time in around 6 years, emotionally.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t need to spend 10k for a session. There\u2019s a lot to the entire science and a billion ways to enjoy the hobby, but just growing your own medicine is pretty straight forward and easy with maybe 2-300 of initial investment. (Not even all of that at the same time.)",

My wife and I lost everything when our special needs daughter was born in 2015 (medical bills and other factors) and I\u2019m actually living in my bedroom at my parents house. I\u2019m in California though, so I hope that legislation that\u2019s been proposed keeps progressing, or possibly my life will let up a bit and I will have the ability to grow my own. I\u2019ve actually been using peptides, brain nootropics, and a bunch of grey market Russian/Chinese drugs that have returned my ability to drive a vehicle. I had brain swelling and vertigo for about a decade so that been much less has helped a ton. Again though thanks for the kind words and I really hope you continue to heal!",

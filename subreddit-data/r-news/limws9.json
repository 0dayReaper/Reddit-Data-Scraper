A while back in Vietnam we had a 13year old coming to work in a factory with his 18yr old sister because he was being abused at home by his parents and didn\u2019t want to be at home with them. We intervened, because we can\u2019t support child labour. But we also can\u2019t support sending this kid back to his abusive parents. The more we talked to the factory, the more the kid panicked because he didn\u2019t want his parents to beat him for ratting on him, and also didn\u2019t want to lose his safe space where he earned money for himself. It\u2019s not as simple as \u201cfire all the kids\u201d because they\u2019re going to find work somewhere else - usually more dangerous and with worse pay. It\u2019s usually a problem at a societal level, not a factory level. \n\nHowever 20+ years is WAY too long to be fucking around with this. We make millions of garments and don\u2019t have any kids working for us. Pay for companies that are above board, and blacklist the ones that aren\u2019t until they get on board",

They are often exposed to dangerous pesticides, experience high rates of injury, and suffer fatalities at five times the rate of other working youth. Their long hours contribute to alarming drop-out rates. Government statistics show that barely half ever finish high school. According to the\u00a0National Safety Council, agriculture is the second most dangerous occupation in the United States. However, current US child labor laws allow child farm workers to work longer hours, at younger ages, and under more hazardous conditions than other working youths. While children in other sectors must be 12 to be employed and cannot work more than 3 hours on a school day, in agriculture, children can work at age 12 for unlimited hours before and after school.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labor_laws_in_the_United_States",

The machine some caught him around the waste and slowly strangled him. His parents didn\u2019t look for him for over 8 hours. By the time he was found he was so hypothermic we couldn\u2019t register a temp on him with any thermometer in the hospital.  They took him to the OR and discovered his entire intestinal tract, froM stomach to anus was dead. Nothing could be saved. But they still had to warm him up to officially pronounce him dead. That took over 12 hours. Only then could they do the studies to pronounce him brain dead as well. And all because his parents sent him to work with heavy machinery and no supervision.",

They are beaten, maimed, abused in many ways, locked in dark sheds with padlocks on the outside, etc. and of course, they never get to taste any of the chocolate they are worked for.\n\nMany of them are either lured with false advertisements or (especially with kids) straight up kidnapped. As with many cases of human trafficking, many are shipped across borders to make it harder to find help or escape.\n\nSlavers usually flat out deny what they\u2019re doing or fall back on claiming they can\u2019t afford to pay. For many finances are actually tight even though the companies they produce for with \u201cfree\u201d labor make a ton of profit. The low pay to \u201cfarmers\u201d (slavers) and lack of accountability encourages them to continue using slave labor. \n\nThis is why \u201cregular\u201d chocolate bars are half the price of slave-free chocolate bars. \n\nThere was an attempt before to get companies to stop using slave labor and they successfully lobbied it down to a voluntary agreement that I\u2019m sure the board of directors had a good chuckle about before tossing in the garbage.",

Ivory coast and the Congo are pretty much the only places left on Earth that are just straight up kidnapping kids by the tens of thousands to work enslaved for no wage.  We've managed to dramatically reduce slavery.\n\nChild labor is still a problem ofc, but there are degrees to such thing, and the severity of that problem has lessened every year world wide.  Global wages, standard of living, and extremely poverty rates were at an all time high in 2020, despite the pandemic.\n\nThe progress in the fight against human suffering in the last 30 years was so significant, it outshadows all the gains from the previous 100 years by double.",

Capitalism as it exists now will always incentivize replacing people with automation, exploited labor, or outright slave labor.",

It\u2019s very labor intensive, very hard work and they work for like the equivalent to a dollar a day. It\u2019s very upsetting to watch and think this goes on. I talked about it with a good friend of mine that is originally from Kenya and he\u2019s very passionate about sustainable development across the world. I was saying how we shouldn\u2019t be supporting these companies, and he (to my surprise) countered what I was saying by yes, but if everybody stopped buying from those companies, now those farmers make no money. So it\u2019s a bit of a catch 22. You have to find a better way before you can stop what\u2019s there now. Because the alternative is sometimes worse.",

They say you should actually recycle even more.\n\nThat being said, the best thing to do is focus more on first 2 of the 3 R's: Reduce and Reuse.  The most impactful thing to do is stop using so many wasteful plastic products.  For example, stop using straws, have reusable shopping bags &amp; buy products in bulk.",

It is as the saying goes - there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. We've gotta work with what we have, and you gotta try not to stop any kind of better action because it's not 100% perfect.

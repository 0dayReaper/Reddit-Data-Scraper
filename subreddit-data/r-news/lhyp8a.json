Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.\n\nRobyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.\n\nBrown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the shit out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'\n\nThe detective said Robyn F. then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.\n\nRobyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'\n\nAfter Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'\n\nBrown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.\n\nBrown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.\n\nRobyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.\n\nBrown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.\n\nBrown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.\n\nBrown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.\n\nShe reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.\n\nRobyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.",

A failed businessman. A failed father. Even a failed grandfather. He should have never been allowed involved in her adult problems, but he wormed his way in anyways. He should have been removed the second he hurt her children, but instead Britney was forced to pay for his legal fees and he remained in charge of every aspect of her life.

Paparazzi outside snapping every photo they could get knowing this woman's breakdown was the biggest payday they were gonna get from her career. I didnt understand at the time as a young woman in the world, how could someone so talented, rich, beautiful, famous, admired and desired be so unhappy in their life that they would do such a thing to themselves at all? Never mind publicly... then i spent 15 years becoming the woman i am today and i have a much better understanding of what was going through her mind and i commend her for refusing to be peoples dancing monkey. \nThe media tried to shame her \"Outbursts\" as an entitled little brat who had everything, the very same media who used to ask her questions about her virginity at 16/17 years old in order to publish in magazines. PR teams that purposely made her photo-shoots as a TEENAGER as sexual as they could. They never represented her as a full whole person - An intelligent woman, a caring mother, a hard worker - They were just trying to make as much money as they could making her a sex symbol on a global scale, its almost the same way Marilyn Monroe was treated. \nIt fucking disgusts me to see how she's been treated by these bastards and her family. I haven't even watched the documentary yet and i hope i can find a way to watch it seeing as im in the UK.",

She's pretty open about not being mentally sound enough to be without some form of oversight. It's unfuckingreal what she's gone through, and what so many other famous people, especially child actors, have gone through.",

It\u2019s not used for 30 year old millionaires who work 5 nights a week",

It does an excellent, thorough job explaining this whole messed up situation. The creators even did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/lgy4fo/were_new_york_times_journalists_samantha_stark/) on Reddit the other day. Today's news is a small but positive step for Britney's freedom (as a 39 year old woman fighting for access to the millions of dollars she's earned since working as a child). Her gold-digging dad Jamie is still **a** conservator but now he will share that power with an impartial bank that Britney and her lawyer requested. She is still fighting to have her father removed as conservator at all and is currently on a work hiatus - refusing to work until her dad is not in charge of her life anymore.\n\nIf anyone wants more information or discussion, feel free to join r/freebritney and r/BritneySpears",

He really laid it all out there for this. \n\nYou can look it up on YouTube and see a bunch of comments talking about how it helped people work to get sober.\n\nI was one of those weirdos that liked tuning into Craig's show. He just seemed so ... normal. It's nice to see him actually get some credit for something.",

With proper treatment, they could have helped her through her post partum depression and get her away from the spotlight, but instead the greedy fucks dug their claws in and here we are a decade and a half later. I loved the documentary. I hope she gets her freedom soon. Her children are 14 and 15 now. It's long past time. #freebritney",

It's honestly terrifying. You'd think someone with that much money would have power, but it turns out they can just sign over all control of her/her money to others under whatever justification they want. I'm sure her father has greased a lot of pockets to keep ownership over her for all this time. This story is a fucking Victorian horror novel. It's some Yellow Wallpaper, asylum, \"hysteria\" shit - but it's all happened in modern day, in public, with her continuing to perform.",

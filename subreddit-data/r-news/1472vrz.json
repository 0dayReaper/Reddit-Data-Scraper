These sorts of crimes are becoming very common though so maybe police will feel pressure to actually go through with subpoenas. A lot of Walmarts, Krogers, and smaller regional chains have also received bomb threats this year.\n\nIn Montana a sheriff was able to pretty easily track down an anonymous stalker who used VPNs and social media accounts with no identifying information. Most police departments will just dismiss any reports of that sort of behavior but I think it's important to acknowledge that it isn't that difficult for them, they're just lazy. Device IDs and location data will give you away unless you really know what you're doing and let's be honest, the dumbass making bomb threats is not likely to be an expert.",

                                    "comment": "Accelerationism (assuming that\u2019s what you were trying type) is actually much older and was only appropriated by the right wing and fascists more recently. It was originally used as a juxtaposition to incrementalism in understanding how revolutionary movements could achieve their goals. Many famous civil rights movements (including *the* Civil Rights Movement) utilized accelerationist tactics. All it really means is that when change from within the system becomes impossible, it is time to change it from the outside. This can mean \u201cdisorderly,\u201d \u201cinconvenient,\u201d or above all disruptive activities like striking, unauthorized protests or demonstrations, mutual aid and other direct action, economic sabotage targeted at companies that are especially oppressive, all the way up to full blown revolution. \n\nBut since the fundamental goal of accelerationism is progressivism (for workers and marginalized people\u2019s rights) the use of the term but right wingers is anachronistic and a little absurd. What they are doing has a name: stochastic terrorism. It is the repression of rights they seek. Unfortunately there is a lot of revisionist history around the revolutionary movements that we laud in retrospect, the whitewashing of MLK and the demonizing of the Black Panthers (where in reality both were necessary and complementary components of the movement). Accelerationism was always demonized by those with the most power because it seeks to more equally distribute that power. But the fact that it is tainted by association with reactionaries is gross and absurd. So long as we agree that sometimes governments are so oppressive they must be stopped through means outside the official, \u201cacceptable\u201d channels, we agree the sometimes accelerationism is necessary. \n\nSidenote, but if you\u2019d like to see an excellent depiction of accelerationism used against fascists, please please watch the star wars show Andor. It is exceptional as a piece of media, up there for me with the best political thrillers and dramas. It includes a lot of real world inspirations from history. It portrays a grittier, more in-depth look at star wars than anything before (at least in cannon) and even people who aren\u2019t massive star wars fans say it doesn\u2019t feel limited by that setting. It\u2019s a story about revolution, sacrifice, and hope - not the wishy- washy vague nod to \u201chope\u201d that other star wars media alludes to, but the blistering desire to build a world you may never see so that others will not have to make the sacrifices you did. I cannot say enough good things about this show from the lens of either political or film analysis, so I\u2019ll stop now. But damn, is it worth a watch and an excellent exploration of accelerationism in action.",

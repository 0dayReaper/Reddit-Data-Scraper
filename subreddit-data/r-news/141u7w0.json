If a kid requires a parent to be with them at all times they shouldn't be in a regular school. But fine, if we accept that provision, doesn't it mean *mom should have been there*?",

These students are in the general classrooms not getting the support they need and pull everyone else's learning down because of their behaviour.

Our children are being used as pawns and it's killing people.",

A lot of the trauma I've acquired happened as I just doing my job and the repercussions impact all aspects of my life.\n\nI worked with severely disabled, behaviorally challenged, elementary age children after I graduated college.  At night I would have dreams about being bit, punched,kicked, etc. Every day on the way to my job I wished for a car accident ,or a natural disaster so I wouldn't have to go to work. I later learned this is called passive suicidal ideation.\n\nI left for a more typical setting. I still found myself reacting to the non violent children.My startle reflex is ridiculous. When I worked at a public middle school I (ASD tutor) ended up having to respond to SED kid tantrums because no one running that program was certified. They would rile them up and we would have to take them down. I prevented a kid from putting a paperclip in their eye whilst in a 45 minute hold. Same kid also once kicked my knee out from under me as I escorted him to the padded room.\n\nMy mental health began really declining shortly after I was bitten on the arm by a nonverbal teenager with minimal precursor behaviors. I had worked with him for years without any previous aggression. I could not fall asleep for days after that. I do not let people hover behind me , my startle reflex remains ridiculous, and I am hyper vigilant in a lot of settings. Recently I became upset as a group of three people wedged themselves between my chair and a wall at a restaurant talking a foot away from the back of my head. My boyfriend had to tell them they needed to find somewhere else to stand after I went to the restroom to collect myself . They did not understand the request until he pointed to the waiting area and told them to fuck off.\n\nI got out of direct service seven years ago. Last year my current job made everyone undergo de-escalation training. I worried about the training for weeks because I did not want to literally reenact \"my greatest hits\" particularly the bitey parts. I asked a coworker who was older than my mother and a head shorter than me to be my partner as I knew she wouldn't leave me with bruises and I told the instructor I was all set with biting.",

Discussion of what happened, why it was wrong, how we can do better etc. It's part of teaching your children right from wrong and yet for some reason, it's a lost cause on a lot of parents \ud83d\ude12",

My kid didn't get in trouble very often, but when he did, I made damn sure he took responsibility, and considered the effect his actions had on others, and how he'd feel if roles were reversed. Thankfully he learned from those mistakes, and never repeated the same one. There were times when I'd think \"that doesn't sound like my kid at all\", but I was always mindful of the way kids will behave completely differently at school than at home. I always gave him a chance to tell me his side of the story, of course, but there were only one or two cases where the teacher had things wrong. In general, if the teacher said a thing happened, it happened.",

She decided it should be renamed _No Child's Behind Left_, as it is structured specifically to screw up schools.\n\nExample: when assessing a school's progress in teaching kids, it measures NOT how a cohort improves as they go from grade to grade, it measures instead how a specific grade tests from year to year. \n\nSo if you have a year of super-smart seventh graders, and then the next year the incoming seventh graders are average, your school looks bad -- according to the intentionally idiotic metrics used in the law.\n\nNCLB is deliberate legal sabotage.",

My mom was a teacher before she had my brother and I and I even tried to follow in her footsteps to become one because I think teachers are THE most important public service employees in this country. You will never, ever, ever, ever see me talking shit about teachers or even public schools as a whole. \n\nBut when my brother and I were in first grade (the same age as the child that shot their teacher), we were hyperactive little shits and our teacher did not want to deal with the two of us. This was 1990, before people really had a good understanding of what ADD and ADHD was. Specifically it was my brother but I had my own problems too. We were on the verge of being expelled from the only elementary school in our podunk, backwater town. \n\nSo my mom did what I said this woman needed to do. She figured it out. She quit her job, got food stamps, and home schooled the two of us until we were better behaved and we could go back to school next year in second grade. \n\n&gt;There needs to be a solution but \"this kid is a problem so let's just destroy any hope they have of becoming a better person\" is not the solution.\n\n\" \" &lt;-- These things? Do you know what they are? They're used either to mark the beginning and end of a title or quoted passage. So please go ahead, reread my comment, and quote me on where I said that. \n\nYeah, it's not a solution. Which is why I didn't say that is the solution or say anything even close to that. Parents are responsible for every aspect of a six year old's life. This is something they need to figure out.",

Living in the area it is widely assumed that she or her family are closely associated with a local prosecutor and/or the state prosecutor. The city of Newport News refused to charge her they passed it to the state Commonwealth attorney's office. The CAO danced around the thought that it would be difficult to charge anyone due to the age of the child. That a six year old \"doesn't understand the judicial system\". Completely neglecting to address the parents. Finally after 90 days from the shooting the CAO charged her with basically child neglect. The release of information about the parents was a complete mystery until pretty much the charge was filled. Which, strangely, isn't common to keep that kind of secret. \n\nThen there is the question of why this specific child and parents had an uncommon learning plan. Why a child reported that the shooter showed him the gun at recess and the shooter wasn't searched. Why were there so many excuses for this specific child, like he's untouchable?\n\nLocal federal prosecutors stepped in from the investigation and decided to charge her with 2 felonies of their own. 100% due to their lack of faith in the state CAO and the outcry of the international news story. Quick comment on the CAO of Virginia, there have been numerous questionable declinations by the CAO that screams corruption. Googling John Blanchard would be the next high profile case.",

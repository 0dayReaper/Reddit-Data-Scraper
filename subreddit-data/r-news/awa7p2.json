            "comment": "I had a friend who used to work for sonic first as a cook and finally after a few years as a manager. He ended up quiting as a manager because the amount he was paid vs the enormous amount of responsibility he had as manager was so off he just couldn't take it. Almost every day someone called sick or just didnt show up to work so he ended up having to do their work too. He was in charge of the whole restaurant and if something went wrong it was his ass on the line. Which is basic manager stuff but the amount he was being paid ended up being only a few dollars more than everyone else. When he explained to me that it is literally not worth it to be a manager since it usually amounted to about 60 dollars a week more in his paycheck but now had to work 4 times as hard and sometimes even more hours he wouldn't get paid for.\n\nConclusion: Working at sonic sucks already. To find out they cut wages in half because they could further proves what a shit restaurant they are. I truly empathize with those workers that walked away. Their time is far more valuable that 4 dollars an hour. ",

At 23 years old, I was making 10.25 an hour basically being the general manager of a 50k a week profit on average restaurant. I did scheduling, hiring, training, inventory, merchandising, prep, cooking, dishes you name it. \n\nThe Pizza Hut district and regional managers were such fucking assholes as well. One time in the middle of summer, our AC broke and the kitchen hit almost 140 degrees. People were almost passing out and the district manager refused to even call someone out or close for the day because he didnt want to miss the dinner rush. I was sweating through my clothes and serving people food dripping in sweat. I warned customers before they placed an order as well. Things like this happened all the fucking time. \n\nAlso, I don't even care about me, the thing that made me the angriest is that they made me cut hours on employees who desperately needed it (it was in a low income area, a lot my employees also worked at the mcdonalds down the street) despite how well the store was doing just to squeeze extra money out of it.\n\nI worked 65-80 hours a week. I would work 12 hours straight and get bitched at by the higher ups if I took a real lunch break. I was smoking a pack and a half a day and slamming down monsters like it was water. Very unhealthy, very stressed out and miserable. I understand youre not really supposed to make a decent wage in fast food, but seriously fuck Pizza Hut. They treat their employees like garbage and I will never give them a dime of my money. People should be treated with respect and dignity regardless of pay.\n\nI was so miserable that it inspired me to get my shit together, study and get a career in IT. Much happier now\n\nEDIT: some people are questioning the profit comment. Yes i mean, revenue, not profit. And I probably cant remember the number exactly off my head as this was around 8 years ago. Kind of just started writing and ranting last night. But we were one of the top 3 busiest stores in the entire state. The regional guy would always brag about that.",

It just seems backwards to me, because we go there for the food.  \n\nI know some restaurants have tried to solve this problem by paying all staff decent wages and just charging the customer more money up front and not allowing tips. To be honest, I would prefer that.... but I say all this knowing that keeping a restaurant in business is ridiculously tough. Isnt it like an 80% chance you close your doors in less than 5 years?",

A few people would stay but most would leave after a few months of experience to go work at McDonalds which paid $9 or Starbucks which paid $11. The manager had no control over the wages as it was controlled by the franchise owner which we never saw or heard of. We always ran out of products because the franchise owner would set a very low budget yet the store had tons of traffic and customers. I explained this to the manager who was an awesome person and he eventually quit and got a better job at a KFC with much higher pay, only making $9 an hour to manage a DD but around $14 to manage a KFC one town over.

Servers in actual restaurants are frequently paid below minimum wage but make up the difference and then some in tips. The difference is you can be reasonably sure that you'll get enough in tips at a restaurant  to get that. I'm guessing at Sonics the people rollerblading out to deliver food were getting tips, and so Sonics wants to effectively dig into those tips by paying those employees less.\n\nEDIT: Had a few comments that this is not Sonic's the company doing this, its the guy who owns the three locations. That might be true, but if you slap Sonic's name on your fast food joint, and sell their products, you are acting as an ambassador for the brand to the public. Which happens to be why you should never shy away from referring to bad ambassadors by the brand they represent. It lets the higher ups know which policy's to (not) suggest to other branches, and to also let bad branches know they are being bad.",

The service is always terrible (and usually the food is crap) because no one works there more than 3 weeks before they either get canned or they figure out few people are going to tip someone for carrying food 20 feet to their car window and leave to work as a server in an actual restaurant where people actually tip because the service provided deserves it.

If corporates claims are truthful, they should have said \u201cWe recognize that our managers dishonesty has caused a great deal of confusion.\u201d\n\nIf you went to work and every manager was saying that the company is being sold and pay is being halved, would you characterizing you believing their false statements as being due a difficulty in your understanding?\n\nBeyond that, we can\u2019t verify that the managers were actually being dishonest.

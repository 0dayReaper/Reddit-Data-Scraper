When he finally relented, he became notorious for his wild driving along the streets of Cambridge, not to mention the intentional running over of students\u2019 toes and the occasional spin on the dance floor at college parties.",

Consider that the man we're talking about spat on the face of reality by refusing to let the illness take the best of him. THEN he made breakthroughs on something that distorts time and space via gravity so drastically that many hypothesize it could allow time travel -- gravity and time being the field of study where Einstein made his breakthrough........\n\nI'm just kidding but still, what a gem was lost today :'(",

He got an illness that usually kills most people in an incredibly short time, and then he lived out to a pretty healthy and average lifespan. All while being one of the most famous scientists of all-time, a person that was an inspiration and got so many others interested in science. \n\nI have nothing but respect for him, I don't think history will ever forget this man.",

Ironically, his condition and synthesiser make it seem like he never aged. He appears the same as he did when I first saw a picture of him, like an abstract icon.\n\nAnd now a guy I've never met just passed away. For the first time - for some reason - I feel l connect to him as a real person and I'm personally gutted.",

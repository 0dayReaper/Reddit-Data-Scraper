As the sibling of a mentally disabled individual, this is frustrating because (a.) it's misinformation, (b.) it serves, possibly intentionally, to derail much-needed discussion about how law enforcement deals with the mentally ill and mentally disabled, and on a personal level for millions of people, (c.) this is the nightmare of every parent and family member of a disabled person for good reason. \n\nThere is room to discuss the facts of the incident, etc., but incorrect armchair diagnosis should not be the focus on a story like this. \n\nReaders should know **Asperger Syndrome has not been considered a valid medical diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association since 2013**. [It explicitly falls under autism spectrum disorder] (https://guides.libraries.indiana.edu/SWIUB/reference#s-lg-box-11618894) (ASD). \n\nFrom *the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition* (\"DSM-5\"):\n\n&gt;Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder).",

Fundamentally, America's policing culture has a problem with overreacting and exacerbating the problems they're being asked to solve. I don't want to paint with a broad brush because it's not fair, so please understand I'm not saying this is everyone, but I think part of the problem might be that policing doesn't attract the brightest bulbs, but they're being asked to do things that require more nuanced thinking than they may be capable of, at least in a high-pressure situation.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, we shouldn't be arming people who aren't able to make better judgment calls in these sorts of situations. If you can't decide when lethal force is warranted, you shouldn't be allowed to make the decision. It's as simple as that. But we've made policing into a business that attracts simpletons with complexes and repels people who genuinely want to protect the public.",

It ingrains in them an instinct to reach for their gun quickly or else they will be killed. There's even a course offered to police officers called \"Killology.\"\n\nIf you remove that training and replace it with much better, more comprehensive training on deescalating situations and on not seeing every interaction as \"life or death,\" it would go a long way towards improving the police. Obviously, this isn't the only thing that needs to be done. There's a ton they needs to be improved/changed, but this is a big one. As long as the \"kill or be killed\" training is given to police, these tragedies will keep repeating.",

And that the noise alone will alert anyone within a 6km radius of their presence. Then they argued that this is why they used [light Army helicopters](https://www.airbus.com/us/en/helicopters/military-helicopters/uh-72a.html) because 'they don't have to follow the rules.' Not many know or care about the FAR/AIM regulations and how military &amp; civilian aviation guidelines practically merged for US airspace after the Hughes Airwest flight 706 crash in 1971.\n\nIt's the reason even the stealthy F-117A Nighthawk had to use position &amp; strobe lights, respond to ATC, &amp; wear radar reflective parts whenever it flew outside bombing ranges.\n\n**Edit:** Muchas gracias for the gold!",

Deescalating is mainly about projecting yourself not as a threat.

Ive been able to deescalate hundreds of situations throughout my 4 year career so far... this includes many people under the influence or with mental health issues.    There are times when cops will bring somebody in from lockup or from the scene where they picked this person up. It's amazing the change the person can have when you know how to properly deescalate a situation. Many times, the cops will make the situation worse with threats to the patient. I usually tell them to back off, let me try first to get the person to calm down. If it doesn't work, we may have to chemically and physically restrain the person... it happens. Sometimes just simply sitting down next to the person on the stretcher and talking with a calm voice is enough to deescalate the whole thing. Many times, these people just want to be heard. \n\nThis situation should have been handled better. Theres no reason why the cops had to use their weapons for this.

You might remember that Tamir Rice was the 12-year-old kid who was murdered by two police officers for the crime of playing with a toy gun (he wasn't playing with it when they rolled up on him, but let's put that to the side for a moment.)\n\nThe former president of the police union was interviewed and asked about the Rice case.  The cop immediately talks about how \"large\" Tamir was.  How he was as big as a grown man--all 5'6\" of him.  The cop used this to justify why it was reasonable for the cops to pump him with lead.  He was big and scary-looking ergo he was dangerous.  \n\nI guarantee you that the same argument will be used to defend the cops in this case.  It won't matter that this was a 13-year-old with special needs and that the cops were informed of this before barging in guns a-blazing.  All that matters to law enforcement is that they never ever feel afraid.  Fuck you if you're afraid of *them*.  Only their feelings and their lives matter.",

You can directly call a CIT, at least in my city, and perhaps that would have resulted in a better outcome, however I would never blame the mother for calling 911 directly as it's much easier/quicker and the response that is ingrained in most people from a young age. It will be interesting to find out whether the dispatcher transferred her to the CIT line or whether they simply dispatched a regular squad car, I'm not sure of those details are currently public.",

She begged me, literally sobbing, to please not call 911 because she had her child with her and was scared of what the police might do to or in front of her daughter.\n\nI wanted to brush that off as a feature of her delusion, just a state-dependent paranoia, but I couldn't. I felt wholly unqualified to deal with the situation that she was in, but ultimately decided to intervene personally anyway because I couldn't live with the potential consequences of placing the lives of my colleague and her child in the hands of yet another \"bad apple,\" if calling 911 resulted in a police response. Worth noting, my colleague is a doctor. Her fear of the police when dealing with a mental health crisis comes from a place of experience.",

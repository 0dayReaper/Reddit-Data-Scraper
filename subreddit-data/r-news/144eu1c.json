            "comment": "&gt; The toddler was in a baby bouncer Wednesday evening when his sibling grabbed an unregistered handgun in the home and shot the 1-year-old once through the cheek and once through the left shoulder, Detroit police said.  \n\n&gt; At the time of the shooting, police said the child\u2019s father was in the backyard working on a fence, while the child\u2019s mother was visiting someone down the street.  \n\n&gt; A law recently signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will require gun owners to keep guns in a locked storage box or container when it is \u201creasonably known that a minor is or is likely to be present on the premises.\u201d That legislation takes effect in 2024.   \n\nThe 1 y.o. is alive.",

It is illegal to be found in possession of an unregistered handgun in Michigan.\n\nEdit - the point I\u2019m trying to make is that the parent should be facing even more severe charges. I\u2019m in Detroit and just heard on the radio that the dad claimed it was in a locked safe under the bed which sounds highly unlikely. Either way it was against the law for dad to be in possession of it in the first place, locked away or not.",

Do you think they didn\u2019t do so 100 years ago? \n\n&gt;\tshooting of homosexuals\n\nMass sjootings fall under the category of new issues I mentioned before, but the treatment of homosexuals absolutely wasn\u2019t. Again, do you think homosexuals were treated better 100 years ago than today, an age where gay people in the US have the right to marry? There are still tons of bigots, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that people can be openly gay today in ways they couldn\u2019t in the past. \n\n&gt;\tall while blaming all society\u2019s faulth on either powerless, poor brown people or Jewish people.\n\nAh yes. 100 years ago, the age where Jewish, brown, and poor people faced unlimited freedoms and respect. Again, do you think jewish and brown people had it better 100 years ago, the age before the civil rights movement and the Second World War?\n\nAnd this is my point. The problems of 100 years ago aren\u2019t as real to us because we didn\u2019t face them. Todays problems we do face on a daily basis, so they feel more real, and feel like they are more predominant. Because for us, they are. But it\u2019s a fallacy to then conclude that means society is on a downwards spiral. \n\n&gt;\tthat we are still struggling to get some of the rights and priviledges that the ancient greeks had 5000 years ago (Granted there are quite a few horrible back then, but the positives have yet to carry as well)\n\nThose parenthesis are doing a lot of heavy lifting there. Because I promise you, if you were shot backwards through time 5000 years and placed in Greek society while being given the choice to return to modern ages, you would not be choosing to stay in the past because society was more progressive than today. (Also, I\u2019m not certain what you are referring to, but if you mean the way Greeks treated homosexuality in the past, I\u2019m not so certain their views are as progressive as you may think they are, nor would I say they are more progressive than today.)\n\nYou will absolutely be able to find certain aspects of society that are worse off today than they were in certain societies in the past. But to look at that and conclude therefore society is on a steady degradation ignores the countless other ways society has made huge progressions.",

Was lgtb community safer ten years ago? Definitely according to hate crime statistic. Banning more books than ten years ago? Can't even keep up with the books getting banned in Florida now. These are setbacks, they are not guaranteed to get better, and with the US population edging ever closer to Fascism, they are bound to become worse before they get better imo.\n\nSociety has indeed made huge progression on most fronts, compared to most of history prior, however, I would suggest this has mainly been due to technological advancements and not necessarily enligjtenment. People are still as willing to fall for hatred, racism and other delusions as they ever were. You can take a look at antisemitism, it was religious antisemitism in the middle ages, economic antisemitism in enlightenment Europe, then finally racial antisemitism culminating in the nazis and the holocaust. This is almost 2000 years of history going from bad to worse.\n\nHeck, if we are are taking the thousand years examples, think that most eastern country actually had third gender accepted and imscribed in law for a thousand years, before our Christian empire builders came about and made many of the eastern countries some of the most transphobic and bigoted countries, except Thailand, Cambodia and a few others.\n\nOnce again, not a guaranteed downward spiral, but no matter the time period, definitely not guaranteed improvement either.",

Today, my five year old was play wrestling with me and grabbed my hand and squeezed my sore finger and I yelped \u201cow!!\u201d and the emotions that went across his face - shock, confusion and then immediate, IMMEDIATE shame and regret for hurting me was so devastating to witness.  He apologized immediately and burst into tears and I assured him I was okay and that he wasn\u2019t in trouble, but it took him a good ten minutes to shake off the tears entirely. \n\nI cannot imagine what that poor six year old is feeling and how big and confusing those emotions are in that small body.  Obviously, the one year-old\u2019s injury is horrifying enough, and I\u2019m so thankful they\u2019re alive, but that six year old should never have had access to something like a firearm, something capable of such permanent, fast consequences for their entire family.  That home will never feel the same because of this. What an awful, awful circumstance.\n\n\nEdit: my son came home from his grandparents a little while ago and one of the first things he said to me was \u201cI\u2019m still so embarrassed that I hurt you this morning.\u201d",

A 6 year old shooting his sibling once is a tragedy and very likely an accident. The second shot really lowers the probability of it being an accident. A .22 wouldn't have a lot of kick, even for a 6 year old, so it's not impossible the lack of kick could have kept the barrel in place to hit the sibling a second time if the trigger was pulled in shock, but it's still low in probability.",

At the least buy a trigger lock and keep it unloaded, doesn\u2019t take half a second to pop a magazine in or drop in speed-loader or a moon clip if it\u2019s a revolver.",

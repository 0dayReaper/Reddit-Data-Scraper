At least all domestic mammals, and many wild ones, have been observed masturbating and there a number of herptiles, birds, and fish which do as well (for the latter maybe have to be a little broader the definition since \u201cmasturbation\u201d with a cloaca is a little different). \n\nCertainly some of the earliest examples of autoerotic behavior may have been just to fertilize eggs laid externally, but there\u2019s other value, too. For example, in island iguanas males with lower social status masturbate until they\u2019re close to ejaculation and then attempt copulate, whereas more dominant males have longer copulation sessions. \n\nUltimately like a lot of behaviors there really isn\u2019t strong selection against it\u2014and there\u2019s probably at least weak sexual selection to routinely ejaculating and removing older, stored sperm\u2014we observe that in animals that have seasonal breeding; semen quality is lower when ejaculation is infrequent. But anything that selects against masturbation is probably also going to capture other parts of libido, expression of sexual behavior, or other sexual physiologic changes which is sort of a no-go.",

These evolutionary behaviorists seem to walk right past the obvious answers/realizations in everything. In this particular case, its the fact that animals are not computers, you can't simply select an action/behavior/whatever and delete it. If you think of the body like a rube golberg machine with sex at the start of the machine and ejaculation at the other; then its not a shocker that maybe you can move further along the \"chain\" and trick the machine to still produce the same result at the end. Nature seems to have no qualm with working with \"good enough\" solutions.",

It's why people get so mad when they're stuck in traffic. Because it's costing them elective masturbation time. It's just facts. The longer you sit in traffic, the less time, theoretically, you have for pleasuring yourself. Why do you think Elon Musk is so intent on bringing about autonomous driving or wants to build rich people tunnels under the city so he can get across town without stopping? Everything he does is oriented around extending Masturbatory Potential Energy (MPE). The more MPE you can get, the better your masturbation frequency. Time and opportunity are the two things that increase MPE the most. Riding alone in a self-driving Tesla in your own private underground tunnel sends one's MPE through the roof.",

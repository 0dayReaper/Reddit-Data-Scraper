Colbert seemed to be working extra hard to pass it off as it being a hilarious joke with Cosby being his \u2018funny quirky self\u2019, but I definitely didn\u2019t get that impression.\n\nTo think, I was sad a comedian I loved growing up was deteriorating and that\u2019s why I searched for him online... only to find the Gawker article about his earlier courtcase, which was unsettling... The bigger break was a few months later when Buress did his bit.\n\nIt\u2019s possible it was all an act even by then but I honestly doubt it. And he seemed to be in complete denial of not just the gravity of what he did but even how much shit he was in throughout.",

I get that it was a defense tactic to make him seem feeble and unable to be a predator, but it was so transparent to fucking everyone that instead it just demonstrated his contempt for the rest of humanity. Like, how low must his opinion of others be for him to think that it would work? It made him appear more likely to commit crimes which dehumanised others.\n\nAnd the idea that it would make him appear to be unable to prey on people, that he couldn't commit these disgusting crimes, I thought totally backfired. He looked pallid, unable to support himself, slimy. He looked disgusting, he looked even more of a vile character. Fucking PR disaster. His defence team should be embarassed.

Each is going to get her day in court, because they deserve to have the crimes against them tried. \n\nThere's good chance that a judge will have the sentences be served consecutively because again, these are crimes against separate women. If the sentences are concurrent, then he really isn't serving time for each individual crime and the victim isn't getting the justice she deserves.\n\nThe optics in a case like this are enormous, and judges are well aware of it.",

He made a lot of dreams happened, but also a lot of nightmares for women in the industry. \n\nWhen it all came crashing down in 2017, he wasn't in a position to finance movies for them, so they abandoned him and now he's going to prison for the rest of his life. That's the thing about power, it is always fleeting.",

It would take place in a hotel room, where the women would be greeted by an assistant who would take them into the room, and then promptly leave so now the woman was alone with Weinstein. Weinstein would then start making inappropriate comments and being handsy and if the actress began to react too negatively Weinstein would make it very clear this could affect whether she got the role *edit: and perhaps even attempting to get her fully blacklisted from Hollywood. All the work, all the auditions and callbacks to finally land an acting job would be for nothing if she didn't let Weinstein grope and sexually harass her. \n\nFuck this piece of shit and fuck anyone who blames the women for doing what they did.\n\n*Edit: My lord, the neckbeards are out in force to defend one of their own.",

He was also a very big name in the film industry that wasn't washed up or running out of wealth by any means. It was pretty much an open secret in Hollywood that he was a prolific rapist.\n\nBut my biggest reason as to why this is so significant...\n\n&gt; Weinstein gave long, rambling statement to Burke, saying his wives \u201cknew nothing\u201d about his extramarital affairs, complaining that he had not seen his children since the allegations against him were made in late 2017, and boasting of the charity fundraising he did on the heels of the 9/11 terror attacks and Superstorm Sandy.\n\nWeinstein's attempts to use his philanthropy as a defence is familiar territory because Jimmy Savile, a posthumously disgraced British TV personality, was damn-near untouchable while he was alive because of his philanthropy,  charity work and ties with the BBC's senior management.\n\nFor those uninformed, Jimmy Savile was deemed by the police to be one of Britain's most prolific sexual predators. And the worst part is that he completely got away with it.",

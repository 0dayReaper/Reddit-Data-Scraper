Some were due to them not having access to dialysis. You have to have running water to do hemodialysis. My hospital didn't have running water for almost 4 days. Was really strange not being able to wash my hands at work. Even still today the water that comes out is white and soapy.\nEdit:this was supposed to be a reply to another comment.

The majority of the deaths are from people who died from carbon monoxide poisoning.   People were using grills inside their homes, or trying to charge cell phones in running vehicles inside their garages, things like that.\n\nThere were also several house fires; several times it was noted that the fire truck was able to get to the scene of the fire but there was no water available from fire hydrants.\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-winter-storm-power-outages-deaths/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-winter-storm-power-outages-deaths/)\n\nOn the 18th, it jumped to \"at least 36\".\n\n[https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/539408-at-least-36-deaths-now-attributed-to-severe-winter-weather-in-texas-other#:\\~:text=Death%20toll%20from%20winter%20weather%20rises%20to%20at,after%20the%20cold%20weather%20crippled%20the%20state%E2%80%99s%20infrastructure](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/539408-at-least-36-deaths-now-attributed-to-severe-winter-weather-in-texas-other#:~:text=Death%20toll%20from%20winter%20weather%20rises%20to%20at,after%20the%20cold%20weather%20crippled%20the%20state%E2%80%99s%20infrastructure).\n\nThese are listed as mostly traffic accidents; one 9-year-old was killed after being pulled on a tube behind an ATV and hitting a mailbox.\u00a0(EDIT - My error.  This happened in Tennessee, not in Texas. )\n\nSpecifically for deaths due to \"exposure\"....The severe winter weather has also led to six deaths due to exposure, including several bodies located next to Texas roads, a Kansas woman found in a nightgown and a Kentucky woman in a mobile home without heat.\u00a0\n\nI guess it's just difficult to find one source right now that specifics the exact number of deaths from exposure.\n\nThe news reports are all over the place; even the NY Post says that a man in Abilene died in his recliner with his wife next to him:\n\n[https://nypost.com/2021/02/19/texas-man-freezes-to-death-in-recliner-amid-frigid-weather/](https://nypost.com/2021/02/19/texas-man-freezes-to-death-in-recliner-amid-frigid-weather/)",

So for Texas, my guess would be wind and rain loads (due to hurricanes) prevailing design, maybe seismic depending on the codes they have to follow.\n\nNow I'm from Michigan, and while snow isn't a big issue, we would be fucked if we got a hurricane strength storm like Texas and the other gulf coast states get because our buildings aren't designed to withstand near that level of wind speed. Granted tornadoes have happened in Michigan, but they're rare and never near hurricane levels, so not it's not the prevailing design load.",

We don't have de icing trucks or snow plows. We don't have snow shovels. (Most people don't even have a shovel of any kind because why would you need one?)\n\nSo it was very gnarly a few days into it, or going to stores or apartment complexes where in other snowy states you'd usually see ice melt or salt thrown down and there's just nothing - tough it out walking on that stuff!

Like you said, just putting you on edge - no power all day? Fuck, better stay awake and HOPE you catch the next 10min so you can frantically fix shit. Will I be able to cook? Should I shit, or wait by the thermostat? Should I run my fishtank off my battery or save it for my phone in case I need to call 911? \n\nFuck oncor, fuck ERCOT, and fuck Republicans.",

Parrots are already far more easily killed by cooler temperatures, and there was no real end in sight to the power outage.  I tried desperately to find a hotel or motel to stay in, but for at least a good hundred miles around everything was either booked solid or the place didn't even have power itself.\n\nThankfully, my ex worked at a hospital, and his department had a couple of little rooms for people working extra long shifts to nap in, and he was able to smuggle me and my parrot into the room where we stayed until we got our power back.\n\nI don't doubt that many Texans with parrots might have lost them to the prolonged cold, and it just breaks my heart to think about that.",

For 4 miserable, cold days I had no shower, no sleep, for 2 of those no warmth, and was crowded into a room with my mother and our 5 animals between us. Oh yea, no gas in the area, and not enough food to go around. We were literally trapped. Warming stations didn\u2019t pop up till night 3, when that shit should\u2019ve been around night 1... but no we\u2019re gonna roll these blackouts. 1/3 of people in dallas with no power. \n\nWhen my electricity came on I came home, no water, had to leave for water and came back to a waterfall behind one of my walls. This is just the half of it, I\u2019m not even joking. \n\nAnd now my animals are sick!  \n\nI\u2019m mad, y\u2019all. **I\u2019m so fucking mad.**",

It happens all the time: if a woman is raped and the police won't prosecute, she sues her attacker. When OJ Simpson was let off in criminal court, his victims family sued him. The woman who killed the teenager while driving won't get extradited, but his family is allowed to sue her.\n\nCivil suits often do not require the cooperation of law enforcement, and that's a major difference. Law enforcement is failing on all ends.\n\nPeople tried to make a joke out of it when the McDonald's coffee lady sued and deliberately omitted the fact that she had 3rd degree burns, needed reconstructive surgery, and the burning temps of the coffee were a deliberate policy set by McDonald's to make it hard to get the free refills. Civil suits are one of the last recourses the average American has left.",

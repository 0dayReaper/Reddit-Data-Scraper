A generic was released though and patient program got cut. Company told me and everyone else on the program to go buy the generic instead. The generic that is $6,000. So I was forced to stop taking it. I've got cuts and bruises and gashes everywhere from falling. One of these days I'll hit my head on something thatll kill me. All because the name brand company is salty that a $6k generic is available. Whole health bullshit is so stupid. At 51 surgeries, I've got some insane stories on health costs. Too bad there isnt a frequent flyer program or I could've like bought the moon by now.",

But they\u2019re willing to provide you with a huge manufacturer discount regardless of your income level, to the point where after insurance you\u2019re only paying $5 per dose. So why do they attempt to charge $20,000 for it? The whole thing is nuts.",

Even if one believes publicly funded research is responsible for every major breakthrough, the process taking a concept and ramping it up for en masse production, high level testing to prove safety and efficacy, and ultimately bringing a drug to market is still ridiculously expensive and difficult. Corporate greed is arguably a much more forceful and efficient motivator than if the government were responsible for that entire process on its own. That doesn\u2019t mean some (or many) companies aren\u2019t extorting consumers or straight off rebranding drugs to rip people off, but nuance is just really hard for people here.",

Qualifications vary from company to company, and there is usually a lot of paperwork you have to fill out and personal information you have to provide, but you might be able to get your medication for FREE. \n\nCheck out Cost Plus Drugs and Amazon Pharmacy.\n\nAnd look into store pharmacy programs. (Drugstore, grocery store) Sometimes, for a small annual fee, you can join a program that provides medications at a much lower price, sometimes even lower than what you would pay using your insurance.

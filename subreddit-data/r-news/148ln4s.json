You can\u2019t be convicted as it isn\u2019t an offence. \n\nCulpable homicide is divided into manslaughter, murder or infanticide. Basically, all culpable homicide involves killing someone through unlawful acts or criminal negligence; but to be murder, there has to be either an intention to kill, or reckless indifference to whether their acts will kill or not (it is slightly more complex than that, but that is the gist of it).\n\nInfanticide is a really specialized case-basically, new moms killing babies during post-birth mental crises get a lesser sentence (s. 233). A man can\u2019t commit infanticide. \n\nIf culpable homicide isn\u2019t murder or infanticide, it is manslaughter (section 234). \n\nSo, essentially, killing someone through criminal negligence, but no intention to kill and no reckless indifference to whether your acts could kill could be \u201cmanslaughter\u201d. \n\nThe difference is in the severity of the sentence. Manslaughter, if not committed with a firearm, had no mandatory minimum. For murder, it is a mandatory life sentence, with various periods of parole ineligibility (for first degree murder, 25 years for adults; for second degree, 10 or more years). For infanticide, the maximum sentence is five years. \n\nhttps://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-32.html#:~:text=(a)%20by%20means%20of%20an,a%20child%20or%20sick%20person.",

There's no related article I can see, but I'm on mobile so maybe that's why. Anyway, it seems she did have some symptoms. I'm not sure why the video says she was asymptomatic.",

The benefit is at the population level of data, not individual with his care specifically. When you're dealing with a pandemic, or any public health crisis, getting data from everyone helps.",

I appreciate the advice from everyone to self-quarantine. I'm already on top of that. I am saying this mostly because, in my case, 4 people are involved here and it is recorded as 1 positive. The numbers of cases we see are an inaccurate representation of the actual impact due to lack of resources and manpower.",

Fever stayed at these levels until maybe Saturday, the 25th. I still have fever although it\u2019s now in the 99.5-100.5 range. I\u2019ve had fatigue, some chest symptoms, headache, body aches but the biggest has been the fever. I\u2019ve never in my life had a fever for more than 2-3 days, and definitely never had one so consistently high. \n\nToday my husband started running one, we\u2019ve gone back and had tests again today-my second test, his first. \n\nI know for a fact they didn\u2019t test me worth a crap the first time. I BARELY felt it, and it was nowhere as bad as a flu test. It took maybe 2 seconds, just in and out like a flicker.

Your fiance has an occupational exposure and should be off work since he's working directly with already sick people. He could be infecting each person who comes into contact with him in his rig. Close quarters, confined space. Healthcare workers get priority testing typically. Have him call his PCP and tell them he had a high risk exposure (coughed on while he was unmasked by a positive COVID pt). They should order the test. \n\nMy conspiracy theory on why they don't just blanket test nurses, EMTs, MDs,  paramedics, etc is that you could potentially be taking out a whole slew of healthcare workers if we're asymptomatic and positive. They'd either have to change guidelines AGAIN(kill me) and just say that we have to be masked 24/7 w n95s, or there's be a massive lack of personnel since we'd all be at home quarantining. They already say we can come to work if we've been symptom free for 72hrs(irresponsible).\n\nI have a myriad of complaints about how hospitals are handling this whole pandemic, and I like to think of myself as someone who tends to see both sides of an argument.\n\nWash your hands, clean your phone, don't touch your face. And since I'm preaching, drink a glass of water, sit up straight-  you're probably slouching :)",

When I worked at a grocery store, the chain gave all employees (with at least 20 hours per week) 3 weeks' worth of hours of time off each year (so if you worked 20 hour weeks, you'd get 60 hours of PTO).\n\nI can't remember anyone calling out sick out of the blue in my department (around 8 people) in the 2-3 years I was there. Folks did leave early if they started feeling ill, and we'd occasionally work out in advance to get shifts covered if we knew something was coming up, but calling out last minute was super rare.\n\nThe chain also gave all employees a temporary $2/hour raise at the start of the crisis. I'm not sure if that's still in effect or how long they intend it to last, but it was a solid move by them.\n\nThey also encouraged employees to set up a 401k and had contribution matching for all employees that averaged at least 20 hours a week.",

She probably had enough symptoms to raise a slight red flag and coupled with her being at the protests, someone probably thought it would be best to test her just to be on the safe side. And I bet she had hoped that she would could come out as negative. That way she could  say, \"Hey, we don't need this quarantine. I was at the protests. I was everywhere. I didn't take any precautions And nothing happened to me! I am negative.\"",

People were shaking hands, not wearing masks and walking in large groups. This was on a video that was posted in their own Facebook group.\n\n\nI commented on the video, saying something like \"Looks like a lot of people not distancing and not wearing masks. We don't want a hotspot here in Raleigh.\"\n\nWithin literally sixty seconds I couldn't view the video anymore because I'd been banned from the group because I suggested taking safe precautions for protesting.\n\nBasically, no wonder she contracted it. Half the people at that protest probably did. And then we're going to have to use resources to save their lives.\n\nI think those people should protest under the agreement that if they contract COVID 19 they have to refuse medical treatment. Since it's a hoax, of course.\n\nEdit: [Here's a video of the protests.](https://youtu.be/ucYXXL2GTbc)",

There is no government anywhere that God has not placed in power.** ***So those who refuse to obey the law of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow.\"***\n\nThese people just say and do whatever they want and blame it on their sky daddy who, according to them, was already explicit in his rules and who they should follow.\n\nIt has ZERO to do with true religious belief. Don't let them wear that shield because that's how they go on this \"persecuted Christians\" bullshit.\n\nIn fact, according to their own beliefs, this leader getting corona is God's will and wrath for not following the laws of the land.",

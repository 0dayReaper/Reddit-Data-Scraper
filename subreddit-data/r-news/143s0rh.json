Google says they use runes on their stuff related to nazi germany.\n- londsdale has NSDA in its name, close to my first example.

Sure wish though that they would put the same amount of effort, energy and publicity into all the right wing extremists, coming out of hiding in germany. \nIt is very frustrating that the right gets away with being horrible solely on the fact that thats just how they always are and when some on the left start being horrible it somehow suddenly needs to be adressed and things have to change\u2026 \nYes the left holds itself to a higher moral standard bit ofcourse that does not excuse the vile actions of their extrimists. But not having these moral standards also does not excuse the behavior of the right wing extemists. \nMan\u2026 its just so sad when all the options for dialogue get taken away. Fucking extremists.

At 5m20s you can see there's been an officer with his knee on the back of his neck as they're cuffing him. He completely stops moving by 6m.  They check for a pulse at 7m and notice there isn't one.",

                    "comment": "I see what you mean in the sense that cardiac arrest is the definition of clinical death, but even that is only partially correct. Cardiac arrest has a few different heart rhythms that can cause it. Asystole (no activity at all) is when death is declared, and even then there\u2019s a certain amount of care to provide. Pulseless V-tach, V-Fib, PEA,  and asystole all are cardiac arrest, and all of them have a multitude of possible causes. Eventually they all degrade to asystole if not promptly treated.\n\nThe patient had a history of atherosclerosis (fat occluding arteries, reducing blood flow), obesity (increased oxygen and cardiac output demands), unspecified irregular heartbeat, more than likely A-fib (unsteady blood flow since no regular rhythm is established and the atria don\u2019t contract properly), hypertension (increased risk of strokes and fluid backup), and drug abuse(bodily wear and tear depending on which drugs). Cocaine is known for causing acute hypertension and tachycardia, stressing the heart more. Physical exertion fighting the cops adds to it. The heart needs oxygen to function, and these factors limit oxygen delivery and increase how hard the heart needs to pump to keep the body going, which further increases the heart\u2019s oxygen demand. Stress the heart out enough, especially with a prolonged history of heart stressors, and it\u2019ll give out at some point. \n\nThat being said, in one of the photos posted on the article, they\u2019re shocking him on his left shoulder blade. Not directly where the heart is, but it\u2019s pretty reasonable to say it did effect his heart, even if just slightly. Whether that was the primary trigger for cardiac arrest or just an additional stressor, that\u2019s the real question.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the police were right or wrong, just providing insight using the provided information on the possible medical factors that likely influenced the outcome.",

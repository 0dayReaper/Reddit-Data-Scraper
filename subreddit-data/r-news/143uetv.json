The other objects some of which maneuvered unlike anything else, no identification has been made publicly, one was described as a grey cylindrical object. One was shot down over Alaska. Kinda weird it went dark after that news briefing and we haven't heard any follow ups on the identity of those 3 other objects shot down.",

Leibniz had a concept for rudimentary computers and relative space 200+ years before we actually start working with those ideas. The greatest minds could certainly conceive of what might be the case 100 years in the future, and scientific history is littered with people who made really good guesses about where ideas were headed. But having the conception of a thing vs understanding the thing makes all the difference.",

One thing I'll say is that earth has been around for billions of years, and there's no sign that aliens have come in the past. So the probability of aliens showing up by happenstance in our lifetime is exceedingly low. I suppose it is possible aliens could pick up on radio signals and such, but even those would have only travelled a little over 100 lightyears and would be incredibly faint. \n\nSo unless aliens are sitting up there and watching us in secret, if they haven't found us yet, the chance of them stumbling across us anytime soon is about 0. I think what the person you're responding to is trying to get at is just the complete vastness of space and time.",

I think, if/when we do find extraterrestrial life, it will probably be something we can't even imagine. That, or bacterial or microbial.\n\nThe concept that, not only do they exist, but they visited here (somehow, faster than light?) during the brief time humans have existed, or that they would be in any way human-like, is super presumptuous and narcissistic.\n\nThe idea of a humanoid thing, travelling space in another thing that you could consider a \"craft,\" is an incredibly human concept. It just seems unlikely that they would take any kind of form like that.\n\nObviously, I'm open to being wrong. Would love to be wrong. But I think it's foolish to get excited when there's literally been zero evidence so far.",

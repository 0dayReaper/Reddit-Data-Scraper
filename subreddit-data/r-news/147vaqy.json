There is simply way too much volume for them to keep stored.\n\nThe way most texts are recovered is via cloud backups the user has enabled.  Specifically iCloud because it's like default and it keeps texts by default.  Sure, the carrier gets the subpoena but they just respond with \"Sorry, that was weeks ago, we don't store text messages on our system.\"  Apple gets the subpoena and they say \"Sure, here's that user's iCloud backup data.  It's got everything you need.\"",

It doesn't matter how smart they are. They will do the dumbest, most reckless, most self-destructive thing... because.",

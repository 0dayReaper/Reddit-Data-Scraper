Jesus christ, can we have some other social service in place to handle this shit like DHS? All of these knuckledragging cops know how to do is draw a taser or a gun. They have zero mental capacity to do anything intelligent or leverage any kind of critical thinking so please, get them out of the fucking equation unless a law is being broken.",

The bigger cities are starting to get more contracts but the pay is typically poor compared to the schooling required. Usually requires a masters in social work with a completed license in a counseling modality. Some cities you just need a bachelor's and they still can't fill the slots. Mine has twelve Clinician roles that ride with Leos and one that rides with fire and they've only filled six seats consistently.\n\nA quick glance shows Tulsa actually has a three person CRT team which is similar. Those teams tend to evaluate if a person is gravely disabled and needs to have their rights taken away so they can be hospitalized. They tend to be pretty backed up though and reactive rather than proactive. \n\nThey do great work but keeping people in the field without burnout is difficult. Most of the folks in counseling swap over to private practice after a stint in crisis work just for the money. Hard to argue 50 an hour and clients you can fire, vs 30 and a drug psychosis case you've been working for six months who refuses to take their court mandated medication.\n\nOh and my city is like half the size of Tulsa. \n\n(side note, some departments have special officers who have a social work degree or training for these cases too. My city has four officers that get sent on the crisis calls, but they can't get all of them. There's a few deputies in the county too. They get a special bonus similar to working in SWAT.)",

One of our LCSW's is transferring to the LEO side of our agency because he'd make more money at work and more in retirement as a LEO vs a LCSW. I like that we have a team for dealing with mental health, I wish we could expand it to a 24/7 service, but we're short enough on patrol that I doubt we'd have the man power for it.",

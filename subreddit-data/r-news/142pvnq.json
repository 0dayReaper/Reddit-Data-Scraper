Every magazine I pick up looks like a copy and paste from a webpage, with a full blown photo, and even the fonts seem all the absolute same with no attempt to match it with the magazine style. \n\nEverything is also super minimalist, no layout creativity, no interesting side facts, extra photos, or even a chance at making the layout draw my eye to anything. They remind of High School yearbooks, where the kids are doing their best to make the yearbooks look well out together and it does the job, but it doesn't have the experience from experienced professionals that care about that craft.",

I get if you stretch the language, you could make the argument that an appeal is \"to keep retrying\" or maybe an EOIR decision after an asylum office denial. There are some other ways you might argue this as well in some narrow circumstances, but this language seems fast and loose.",

Title 42 did two things.\n\n The first thing it did was take away the consequences for crossing illegally for most people. Under 42, most not all were fingerprinted and taken back to the port to be returned to Mexico.  Once back in Mexico, many would just try again since there were no consequences for most.\n\nThe second thing that 42 did was it made it quick and easy to process people.  Which meant that we did not need many agents in processing.\n\nAfter 42 ended, the administration decided that processing was the priority.  I am not kidding when I tell you that some nights we had zero agents in the field because all were ordered to process\n\nThat meant that there were no agents to catch people crossing illegally in some places.  The reason for this was that after 42 ended, the processing took a whole lot longer, and we \nneeded all hands on deck to process.  So encounters went way down.  The other major factor was that DHS created an app that allowed people to sign up for a day and time to present themselves at the port for asylum.  In other words, people seeking asylum no longer had to cross illegally.  So once again encounters by Border Patrol agents decreased.",

I see Mexican plates all the time. Also Mexicans come across the border to shop and work and go to school and yadda yadda.\n\nNot to mention NAFTA.. Laredo alone does about 1 billion per day in commerce coming across the border because of near shoring.  You just can't \"close the border\" because it's an economic machine for this country.\n\nIt's mass amounts of misinformation and cartels that exploit that which has people risking their lives to come across the border illegally when there is actually a very easily legal way to do it.\n\nGet a passport, tell us you just want to shop, and we open the door for you.",

CBP has, as of June 1, expanded the number of appointments available to 1,250 each day.\n\nOkay, CBP One is being used and seems to be working. However,\n\n&gt;But some Republicans have expressed skepticism of CBP One, saying the app is a vehicle that would allow mass migration.\n\nHow, exactly, would it allow for mass migration since its purpose is to allow US Customs and Border Protection to better organize and assess who is and is not eligible to migrate into this country. It\u2019s purpose is to streamline and make the whole process more efficient. Too bad if parts of this are enabling would-be migrants, including asylum seekers, to connect with the relevant legal services.\n\n&gt;\"Abusing the CBP One App is the Biden admin's newest tactic to funnel tens of thousands of illegal aliens into the country every month. House Republicans voted to bar DHS from exploiting the app &amp; restore it back to its original intent,\" Republicans on the House Committee on Homeland Security tweeted Monday.\n\nHow is the app being abused? From the US Customs and Border Protection site, about the app:\n\n&gt;CBP One\u2122 is a mobile application that serves as a single portal to a variety of CBP services. Through a series of guided questions, the app directs each type of user to the appropriate services based on their needs.\n\nIt seems it\u2019s being used as intended. Sorry if it\u2019s working and destroying the Republican narrative. Also, how much is it within the purview of House Committee on Homeland Security to dictate *how* the Executive branch executes what it\u2019s been mandated, where the actions  aren\u2019t contrary to what\u2019s been explicitly legislated (Did the GOP stealthily pass some legislation that requires all actions by Democratic administrations pertaining to immigration must have disastrous outcomes?) It seems like the Republican response has been more like: \u201cOh, shit! This thing works?! We can\u2019t have that!\u201d It also kind of diminishes the message and urgency DeSantis was trying to broadcast with his most recent stunt of transporting migrants from El Paso, Texas (not even his state) to Sacramento, California.",

(And asylum and refuge use the exact same application procedure otherwise.)\n\nAlso, while the Trump administration first proposed the safe third country rule, it was never implemented while Trump was president, as it was blocked in court the entire time. It was not implemented until February 2022 and not announced until March 2023, and it sure looks like a southern border STCA is coming soon (which means it is most likely already functionally implemented, similar to the Canadian STCA). Title 8, with Mexico's new cooperation with it, is really the big story here; and is also another signal that a Mexico STCA is coming.",

Haha Federal...I'm sure Pai will fix it for us.\n\nReceived confirmation below that account deletion is currently disabled in Europe.\n\nAnother edit: Maybe instead of our ID we should all send them pictures of Winnie the Pooh.\n\nHere's a directory of state consumer protection agencies if anybody wants to go that route. No idea which states would even care but maybe try yours. https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer\n\nEdit: just got up and tried again. The delete your account page says it was updated 2 hours ago but I don't know changed. It \"submitted a ticket\" with the SMS verification this time but has not yet confirmed deletion.",

If even a fraction of people do so, it may very well overwhelm their ability to respond to requests, which would subject them to extraordinarily huge fines.  And you'll get your data, which is great, because if they're owned by, and subservient to, an authoritarian dystopian nightmare like China, it would really benefit you to see the dossier they've accumulated on you.\n\n[This article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee) has some info about the regulation. \n\n**EDIT:**  [A commenter below has provided an excellent form letter](https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f35dslz/) people can send to Blizzard requesting specific types of personal data.  This is really great.  I know Blizzard has disabled their automated system, so it would be worth it to print this out and snail mail a copy to Blizzard HQ.  \n\n**EDIT**:  [Another commenter details the inanity of complaints that people utilizing this law will somehow \"get it taken away](https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f35o74c/)\n\nA lawyer or legal expert int he EU should weigh in here on how exactly people should go about doing this though.\n\n**EDIT:**  People have said they can file for an extension if they are backlogged with requests.  I've heard 2 months of extra time.  I would say that's fine.  They can't just *not* fulfill the request.  \n\nKeep in mind the GDPR are new laws.  The EU may be looking to make an example of companies, and may come down harshly on Blizzard for non-compliance, especially given Blizzard's stance on Hong Kong and them going to bat for China.\n\n**EDIT**:  Additional people are claiming (without citation) that courts would throw these requests out because they were organized.  I would like someone with knowledge of the legal system in the EU to weigh in, but I am extraordinarily dubious about this.  For one, Blizzard would have to prove each request was legitimately \"malicious\".  For two, laws aren't usually chucked out the window because it's \"hard\" for companies to comply.\n\n**EDIT**:  Naysayers keep insisting that utilizing an existing and unambiguous law is \"abusing\" it.  I would say that authoritarian China owning a 5% stake in Blizzard and Blizzard taking a clear stance in favor of authoritarianism and suppression and treating advocacy for Democracy as hate speech represents an extremely urgent need for everyone in the EU to figure out what data Blizzard is accumulating on them, and then delete it to ensure it does not fall into the hands of monstrously murderous authoritarian regime. \n\nThat's why the law exists in the first place.  Insinuating they will \"take it away\" *if you use it* is absurd.  \n\nAnd if it turns out that the requests are easy for Blizzard to field, then the worse that happens is you took five seconds to get your personal data and now know what Blizzard accumulated on you and can make the informed decision whether or not to delete your data. \n\nThat's a good thing.  Every person on Earth should have unencumbered access to the totality of what corporations are accumulating about them online.  It's your data, not their property.  \n\n**We do not live in fear of corporations.  We do not owe them the courtesy of making their lives easier.  If they can skirt existing laws because those laws are \"hard\", then we know the laws need to be strengthened.**\n\n**EDIT:**  A lot more HailCorporate people here then I would have ever expected. \n\nIt's really interesting that so many people are so concerned for the welfare of massive companies and so sympathetic with their plight to hand over personal data they collect on their users.  They're very upset that mean people would dare to abuse the law by simply requesting that data. \n\nThere is, of course, a really easy way companies could comply, instantly, with these requests: *stop compiling and reselling user data*. \n\nBlizzard doesn't *have* to stick a tracking device on me and monitor every other website I go to after I visit them, log which games I play for how many hours, log my buying behavior on their loot boxes, sequence my genome to determine my suscpetibility to dopamine slot machines, and so on, and it certainly doesn't need to bundle that data and sell it to the highest bidder.\n\nThey could just, I dunno, make good games?",

Laws cannot simply be removed. There is a legal process. In the EU, the general legislative process is long-winding due to the EU's nature of offering a framework for member states to find common laws. Ever tried to make 27 people agree on anything? Now try nation states. Once they agree on a law, that *stays*.\n\n2. In this spirit, the GDPR is one of the EU's poster childs. It will never be repealed. The entire EU's strategy is to set itself up as the guardian of your digital rights, and export this regulation. This is not only done for scoring domestic points, it exemplifies our best means to assert control over non-domestic industry. This is [a geopolitical strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect), not some random law.\n\n3. The new Commission for the next five years is being put through parliamentary inquiries right now. Vestager, the same woman who took on the digital giants as competition commissioner, will be the minister equivalent (= here, vice president) for the digital single market &amp; competition. As stated earlier, GDPR is not only one of her main weapons but a weapon she helped craft. A high-profile case such as HK is a godsend for the EU, which generally has a hard time doing PR.\n\nIn conclusion: if Europeans decide to use GDPR - which we should! - then the EU Commission will unequivocally stand behind a law it itself wants and needs. Anybody telling you otherwise just showed you how ignorant they are of the entire process, or how well-paid for spreading disinformation.",

Like a month or two of suspension and a warning that if he does it again they'll throw the book at him.\n\n*And this would not have been a story, at all.* It probably would not have even registered in other ActiBlizz communities, let alone been a thing to people completely outside of gaming. Yet - thanks to their intense, burning desire to suck up to the CCP now EVERYONE knows about it.  \nEven more people are now aware of all the vile shit China does, thanks to people linking stories about China's human right abuses under every Blizzard/China post on all the social media. And it's now very obvious that Blizzard is full of shit when they claim to support human rights (as they did with LGBT stuff). They don't. They like to say they do when it costs them nothing, but they don't.\n\nWell done, Blizzard.

Sounds like they'll be okay with personal political beliefs as long as those beliefs don't butthurt China or are in favor of China.\n\nCome on, make your rules apply equally to everyone. If you wish your company and your events to be apolitical, then you don't have to defend anybody's \"pride and dignity\".\n\nEdit: I just want to mirror Kibler and state that I am no expert on the intricacies of the geopolitics between China and HK. However, I am bothered by Blizzard's hypocrisy by pretending to be apolitical, while being very pro-China.",

Blizzard deserves every single drop of shit they get for this, but it doesn\u2019t stop with them. \n\nLast night in PHILADELPHIA (Wells Fargo Center) the NBA removed a protestor holding a Hong Kong support sign at a preseason game, here in AMERICA. \n\n*Edit: It\u2019s been pointed out to me that the fan was being unruly and that political signs are more or less always prohibited at sporting events. Whatever the case may be in Philadelphia (do your own research and decide), it does not change the fact that China\u2019s influences are here. Hollywood has been afraid to show the Chinese in a bad light for years. Apple pulling the Taiwan flag emoji. Shit like this is everywhere and it\u2019s becoming more and more common. South Park really wasn\u2019t joking last week.*\n\nOutrage should be the starting point and it should escalate from there. This is unprecedented and inexcusable.",

They are thinking generations. And now that they have economic clout combined with a significant military, they are incrementally creeping out. \n\nThey are making islands in the pacific out of atolls and militarizing them. They are claiming islands that belong to other nations. They are diplomatically isolating Taiwan from the rest of the world. They are doing the whole Silk Road 2 project. They established their first overseas military base in Africa recently.\n\nThey are playing a generational game. One where China slowly absorbs the world, either by might or dollar. That is their plan anyway. Forcing the world to comply with their political beliefs in our media is a step - watch South Park (the latest season in a couple of episodes) - they lay it out. \n\nWe have to keep calling this out all the time. Corporations should be forced to make a stand. You are either for freedom or for the dollar. \n\nOf course, the cynic in me says no one (or not nearly enough) will change their behavior to force corporations to change theirs.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the silver!\n\nEDIT 2: Gold - thank you!",

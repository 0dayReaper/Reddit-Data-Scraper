His lawyers, though, insisted that it was consensual sex and that she bragged afterward to others that she had sex with a celebrity\n\nBoth can be true, so tired of the excuses like she enioyed it, or she didn't tell officials, or she bragged about having sex with a celebrity, or whatever. None of that matters, what matters is consent. If she didn't give it, and she didn't want sex initially and he forced it through coerced acts, he raped her. The human body and brain does crazy things, it responds to sex and trauma counterintuitively, and young people are irrational in response to big events, especially where fame and power are invovled. It's much easier to after the fact try to convince your brain and your loved ones that it was a good thing, rather than to face that you were used, abused, and had your agency/power/free will taken away from you.",

I believe they should be heard and protected to the fullest extent possible. \n\nThat being said, just as the victim can rationalize the trauma of sexual assault, a person who\u2019s intentions are malicious can just as easily \u2018withdraw\u2019 their consent and accuse anyone, in this case a famous and wealthy individual of rape. Unfortunately they are out there and do so much harm to the process for real victims. Which is why the burden of proof in the court of law, lays with the accuser. They have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt what they claim is true. We cannot just wantonly throw away someones life and reputation simply because we refuse to question the victims claims. There is no right or wrong answer to this. The system is imperfect but we cannot just blindly accept every claim without due course or condemn an innocent person on words without proof.\n\nEDIT: Poor grammar and sentence structure.",

            "comment": "&gt;Chris Young, 36, was on his way home from Ford Field early Saturday with his mother Katrina Young, after WORKING the Friday night Taylor Swift show.\n\n&gt;Chris is now using a rental wheelchair. Insurance will cover SOME of the costs to get a new wheelchair and a van, which can cost up to $100,000, but the family needs help. \n\nI hate this fucking country and anyone that works for health insurance companies. He should not have to work. EVERYTHING he NEEDS should be 100% converted by insurance. \n\nWTF?!? A rental wheelchair?!?!?",

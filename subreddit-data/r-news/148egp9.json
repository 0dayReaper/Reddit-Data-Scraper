Plus I'm full time telework which can be anywhere in the US, if I was single I'd be living in my rural hometown of Ohio where it costs little to nothing to live.  \n\nThe good news for us is there is a solid block of democrats in the house which want a 8.9% pay raise in the house.  It is also supported by about 5 republicans who have seats in the DC &amp; NYC area who are for it also.  If this doesn't happen Biden will give us a 5.2% this year.  \n\nAlso there is a new special pay rate schedule for IT workers which should be implemented next fiscal year, this would give us around a $18k raise.  If this &amp; the 8.9% raise happen I'll be close to $150k next March when my next step kicks in.",

Conservatives talk about family values and the like but rallied behind a man who paid off pornstars, cheated on his wife and has had children outside of marriage. At this point we've had hundreds of instances of conservative politicians and/or religious leaders be caught doing sexual acts with underaged kids, people that aren't their spouses, sex workers etc.  But it never really seems to turn off large swaths of conservatives because it's not about behavior or social/political stances.  It's about the in-group winning regardless of what is going on.\n\nProgressivism is about the particular behavior and social/political stances over the people in the group.  A legislator like Al Franklin will get blasted by his own party to resign because of sexual assault allegations.  Him being part of the in-group is irrelevant if he exhibits behaviors that go against the behaviors/stances that the group finds desirable.  Progressives want to win but also have a weird sense of needing to win the \"right\" way.  \n\nObviously this is a generalization for conversation purposes but I think it fits a lot of folks. Once I realize this core difference in ideology at lot more made sense.  Especially understanding why conservatives seem to be able to consistently hand wave away contradictions to stances they claim to follow and why progressives seem to self canabalize themselves when people step out of line just a little bit.",

The fact that prices went up everywhere and stayed there should have been a strong indicator that this wasn't gouging. Profits in the grocery sector went up not because their margins increased, but because they simply sold more product as people were priced out of restaurant dining.\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230215005260/en/",

Then really little month-over-month inflation, but the reported rate is always based on annualized inflation rates. So, that 9% we saw basically all year, was really like 9% from February to March of 2022, then relatively flat since then. \n\nConsumer numbers are also screwy, since you can look at a lot of corporate profits and basically see the inflation numbers in profits, which means that a lot of what you and I were seeing as inflation was not supply chain driven, but retailers simply jacking prices and taking profits.",

So if last year inflation was 10% (for example), and now we got 4% on top of that. Last year prices shot up, and they are even higher today. At no point are prices actually coming back down, the rate of increase is merely slowing. If basic goods and services were too expensive last year, they are even more expensive this year.",

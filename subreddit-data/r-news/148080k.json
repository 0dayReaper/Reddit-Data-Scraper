Two children suffered burn-like injuries, the Longmeadow Fire Department said.   \n      \n&gt;Investigators found muriatic acid, a pool cleaning chemical, at Bliss Park Playground in Longmeadow on Sunday morning. Authorities said they were performing forensic and finger print analysis to identify the perpetrators.",

By spring time the pool was a swamp. Drain it and clean the sides/bottom with muriatic acid. \n\n\nIt was nasty shit but it worked really well. But we\u2019d also use it if the balance was off. Could get it at any local hardware store by the case. It was usually 1/4 the price as the stupid pool supply places.",

One of the students asked what the counter would be to this, my teacher's answer was amputation...",

I have no idea where everyone got the idea that HF is some boogeyman of a chemical that\u2019ll instantly melt through flesh. If a drop of HF gets on your skin, you probably won\u2019t even notice it\u2019s there. It may take hours before you even notice a burning sensation. The danger with HF is that the fluoride ions diffuse through your skin and start reacting with cations inside your body, particularly the calcium in your bones. That\u2019s how it fucks you up. But if you\u2019re aware that HF got on you, and you\u2019ve taken the precautions that you should have when you started working with HF, then all you need to do is flush the area with water for 5 minutes and then apply a calcium gluconate gel that\u2019ll react with any fluoride ions before they go deeper into your skin.",

He then called emergency services for help.  Knowing that just water wouldn\u2019t rinse this away he ran into the stock room and grabbed a container of gluconic acid and some calcium carbonate and mixed them together to create the calcium gluconate. \n\nWhen he got to the hospital he helped the doctors continue treating them as they had never encountered an HF exposure before.",

If it gets to your lungs it'll shred them, and this kills you real quick, and if you're sufficiently overexposed it just rips everything apart. If skin exposure risks those then it'll get into your blood to your heart first, and generally kill you that way first.\n\nGetting to your bones is actually better. It'll just liquify them and form various exotic calcium compounds inside your bones. That's indescribably painful, but less lethal, and is a relatively effective means of neutralization-your kidneys can theoretically filter that stuff out, if they don't die attempting it.\n\nThis is all skin exposure. The biggest risk possible is exposure to HF vapor, which gets in your lungs and destroys them. If the loss in function does not kill you the lungs are a direct line to your heart.\n\nHalide vapors and gases are dangerous, although their military application is limited due to their reactivity and properties generally result in quick dispersal. Fluorine gas in particular just rips everything around it apart and becomes relatively harmless too quickly.",

I've probably used at least 1,000 gallons of it over the course of my career (comes in 55 gallon drums for commercial work).\n\nIt's not really that bad.  Like, ya it'll dissolve stuff - including your skin - but it's not like the scenes from Aliens where the acid blood of the xenomorph instantly dissolves everything.  You've gotta really be trying to hurt yourself to hurt yourself with it.  Imagine holding your hand over a lighter but having time to remove it (because its fire and you'll be burned).  You've gotta do that quick right?  A couple seconds?  Change that to like 1-2 minutes for muriatic acid.\n\nI've gotten it in my eyes and stuff too (watered down to about 25% strength).  As long as you don't just sit around and go \"OMG ACID IN MY EYES\" you can calmly find a bit of water and wash them out without a big deal.\n\nThat's not to say it won't dissolve your skin.  I have a few stories about that too - it's just I don't want people to get the wrong idea about the stuff.  It can be safely handled and used with some minor precautions and accidents with it won't leave you immediately and permanently fucked up.",

If I have jeans on and it's hot sometimes I'll accidentally spill a little acid on my jeans around my calves without noticing. I'm working hard and not playing any mind to it.

A group (or pair?) of people stealing easily available acid and contaminating a playground sounds 100% like teens. Adults don't usually commit useless crimes as a group--if they are grouped up for a crime it is usually for purposes of obtaining money (or items that will translate to money). You might get a severely mentally ill adult who acts alone on something like this, but I can't see a whole group of adults doing this when there was literally nothing to gain. \n\nSource: Unfortunately I'm related to a lot of criminals",

But their problem people get covered in the big town's news, so it's on the record that the dirtbags are not just from the cities.  Local privilege can enable a lot,  but the way it's been explained to me is that attorneys are what make the biggest difference for the rich enjoying impunity.  If you have the right lawyer,  then you don't have to suffer consequences as much.  But you probably already have an established relationship with them before using them for criminal law matters.  If you just call them the first time,  when you get arrested,  then it's not the same.  I'm talking about stuff like how quickly you can get bailed out on a weekend,  and the whole court process after,  not getting used with any permissible extra fuckin with you by cops, jailers,  and prosecution.  You might be from Longmeadow but you still have court in Springfield.  So a lawyer probably doesn't care about that like the cops.",

It was a very cute geocache clearly intended for kids, full of toys and drawings for kids. \n\nI was wearing sandals that day, and as I was searching I stepped on something that shifted. Looked down and I was standing on a literal pile of needles, a few shafts nearly touching my bare feet. Some had spilled over and were in reach of any kid on the other side of the fence.\n\nAt least was by some adults who didn\u2019t care, rather than ones maliciously trying to hurt kids. But it\u2019s clear some adults just don\u2019t care about children at all and wouldn\u2019t mind seeing them come to harm. \n\nI learned how to call my city\u2019s needle disposal program that day. Of course they\u2019ll never know who did it (I suspect it was a group judging by how many needle there were), but in this case they better investigate and make sure they don\u2019t up the ante.",

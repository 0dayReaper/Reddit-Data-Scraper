The argument  that safety might be violated if a protest occurs is hogwash in any legal theater - if it wasn't this law could make street preaching illegal on college campuses owned by the state government if any of their content was to be seen as redressing the government.

Their uneven enforcement often makes protest restrictions vulnerable to a legal challenge under the 14th Amendment. \n\nPersonally, I really don\u2019t get the appeal of protests- they might have worked in the distant past, but these days you\u2019d be hard pressed to find any politician whose mind can be changed on \u201cbig issues\u201d by people in the streets.

Imagine political energy as this thing which piles up and eventually expresses itself into the real world in some sort of action. The energy which is piled up originates from people's individual grievances, which are reflected in social fabric. The action which is emitted out, can be person to person interactions (ranging from discussions, ridicule or violence), person to item interactions (destruction, construction, or modification), and person to \"system\" interactions, system being defined as an entity which reaches a sort of impersonal critical mass (a sort of parasocial interaction emulating person to person but against an impersonal entity). This energy can be a great use towards change but if left untended it can result in utter chaos, thus laws were created to help contain it. The problem with containing energies, are that containers are only rated insofar as what they're constructed of.  So societies allow for numerous types of \"outlets\" to let this energy out in a safe way, yet paradoxically these outlets can result in more energy being generated elsewhere. Via removal of the outlet of protests to only government approved ones, this will make spontaneous demonstrations illegal, thus higher stakes and thus more prone to violence. Other countries get away with placing outlets in the form of loosely enforcing laws (contrast to selectively), providing public amenities (scandnavian countries), or accessible consumer capitalism (china); such that the population is roughly speaking kept at maintainable levels. In america it'd be nothing short of sabotage to kill our right to protest since:  laws are \"selectively\" enforced, amenities are being gradually removed, and the consumer capitalism aspect has been drying up with rising costs on everything.",

Some dissenters do so on \"originalist\" grounds, which considers the text of the law and its understood meaning at the time it was passed. So, in this example, they are rejecting Gorsuch's argument on the grounds that the 88th Congress couldn't possibly have meant \"orientation\" when they explicitly said \"sex\" (especially given that sexual orientation discrimination was the widely accepted law of the land), and the fact that our cultural understanding of and use of the word \"sex\" might have changed shouldn't *automatically, retroactively* change a law drafted in 1964.\n\nBoth are \"right\", and straightforward in their way, but can each have unintended consequences. Consider a second example:\n\nThe 2nd Amendment guarantees the right of the people to \"keep and bear arms\". At the time, this would be widely understood to encompass the armaments commonly used in war at the time: flintlock muskets and handguns, swords, maybe cannons, etc. Should that limited, original meaning constrain modern interpretation? Or should it include arms that are employed today, like machine guns or drones?\n\nTextualism lends itself to a \"left-wing\" interpretation in the first example, and a \"right-wing\" outcome in the second example. This is why it's important for people who view the world as being organized on a Left-to-Right spectrum need to be careful about kicking decisions like this to the courts - jurists have other spectrums, other philosophies, that apply to their work. Much safer, and more predictable, to pass a clear and unambiguous law in the first place, or to explicitly amend it to fix an issue later.",

The only thing that's changed from scenario A to scenario B is the sex of the individual, so it's discrimination based on sex.",

            "comment": "&gt; **The Supreme Court held on Monday that workers cannot be fired for being gay or transgender in a major win for members of the LGBT community.** \n&gt; \n&gt; The ruling is a blockbuster development in the history of gay rights in the United States.  \n&gt; \n&gt; While workers in about half the country were protected by local laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, there was no federal law that explicitly barred LGBT workers from being fired on that basis. \n&gt; \n&gt; **The cases were brought by three workers who said they were fired from their jobs because they were gay or transgender.** They argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which says that employers may not discriminate based on \u201csex,\u201d also applies to sexual orientation and gender identity. \n&gt; \n&gt; **The workers who brought the cases are** **Gerald Bostock**, a gay man who was fired from his job as a child welfare services coordinator in 2013 after joining a recreational gay softball league; **Donald Zarda**, who was fired from his job as a skydiving instructor after revealing his sexual orientation to a female client; and **Aimee Stephens**, a transgender funeral director who was fired after announcing her intention to present as a woman.\n\n\nThis is awesome. Thanks to those 3 for fighting for their rights and those of millions more.",

            "comment": "This is [a historic decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf) which will protect hundreds of thousands of LGBT employees from discrimination. The opinion was 6-3, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Roberts, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Breyer. Kavanugh, Alito, and Thomas dissented.\n\nAs of today, the Supreme Court puts being gay or transgender in the same category as being black when it comes to employment discrimination. You cannot fire or discriminate against an employee for being black and you cannot fire or discriminate against an employee for being gay or trans.\n\nHere are the opening two paragraphs. They explain everything you need to know:\n\n&gt;Sometimes small gestures can have unexpected consequences. Major initiatives practically guarantee them. In\nour time, few pieces of federal legislation rank in significance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There, in Title VII,\nCongress outlawed discrimination in the workplace on the\nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Today,\nwe must decide whether an employer can fire someone\nsimply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer\nis clear. An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different\nsex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the\ndecision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\n\n&gt;Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have\nanticipated their work would lead to this particular result.\nLikely, they weren\u2019t thinking about many of the Act\u2019s consequences that have become apparent over the years, including its prohibition against discrimination on the basis\nof motherhood or its ban on the sexual harassment of male\nemployees. But the limits of the drafters\u2019 imagination supply no reason to ignore the law\u2019s demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it\u2019s no contest. Only\nthe written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to\nits benefit.",

We can \nsee this because it is quite possible for an employer to discriminate on those grounds without taking the sex of an individual applicant or employee into account.  An employer\ncan have a policy that says: \u201cWe do not hire gays, lesbians,\nor transgender  individuals.\u201d  And an employer can  implement  this  policy  without  paying  any  attention  to  or  even \nknowing the biological sex of gay, lesbian, and transgender\napplicants.\n\nEdit: To explain why I disagree, for an employer to know whether an employee is homosexual or transgender, the employer **must** know (or assume) the employee's sex. Scenario: Employer Tom is interviewing Employee Jim. Employee Jim shares that he recently bought a home with his husband Terry. Tom decides not to employ Jim because Jim is gay. The only way for Tom to know Jim is gay is to know that Jim is **Male** and has a husband. If Tom did not know or consider that Jim was male (as contested in the dissent) then him having a husband does not disqualify him under the discriminatory policy. Thus the policy **is** using sex as a deciding factor. Similarly, Susan identifies as female and applies at Tom's business. He says, sorry, I have a no transgender policy and refuses to hire her. For him to identify her as transgender, Tom must know (or assume) her biological sex. Again, he does use sex in the hiring decision and is therefore against the plain text of title VII.\n\nEdit 2: I've been getting a lot of replies saying essentially, \"Well, the employer could just put a checkbox on the application asking if the individual is homosexual or transgender and disqualify them that way without knowing their sex.\" They could, but notice that in the dissent, the author writes, \". . . an employer can  **implement**  this  policy  without  paying  any  attention  to  or  even knowing the biological sex of gay, lesbian, and transgender\napplicants.\" (Emphasis mine) How would this policy be implemented (in other words, enforced) without knowledge of sex? If Susan (the transgender woman in my example) says that she is not transgender on the form, how is the employer to respond? He can't say, \"Yes you are, you are fired for being transgender,\" because to identify her as transgender would be to assume her biological sex and presented gender differ. The employer also cannot say, \"You lied on your application, you are fired,\" because to establish such a lie would also assume her biological sex and presented gender differ. The discriminatory policy would be unenforceable and therefore un-implementable.",

It's probably why they had him write the decision.\n\nHe's a self-professed originalist, but he's really a spiritual originalist:  \n&gt; Or consider the Fourth Amendment. As originally understood, it usually required the government to get a warrant to search a home. And that meaning applies equally whether the government seeks to conduct a search the old-fashioned way by rummaging through the place or in a more modern way by using a thermal imaging device to see inside. Whether it\u2019s the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on torture, its protection of speech, or its restrictions on searches, the meaning remains constant even as new applications arise.\n\nWhat did the law mean when it was written?  Not what the words say, but what was its intent?  Was it to protect people from discrimination?  If that's the case, then it must be interpreted to mean the same thing despite the fact that circumstances in the world have changed around it.  This is quite the opposite of other originalists, who take them to mean what they meant the year they were written",

Everything she's heard is that he's a pretty straight-edge person. Graduated early, was known for being an outstanding student, was well-liked by his peers. I honestly do think he's just a textualist and though he's gonna throw down some opinions that are irritating he'll also having rulings like this that catch people off-guard.",

Whereas someone like Alito is very clearly just deciding controversial cases on the basis of his political beliefs, as he'll take completely contradictory positions when they produce results he doesn't like.",

A direct interpretation used to mean more conservative because, traditionally, conservative used to refer to slower changes in government. In the US, however, conservative and liberal are more linked to stances on social issues, not traditional meanings of the words, though this was not always the case. As conservatives get more radical, a direct interpretation will look more liberal based on our connotations of the word \"liberal\". 15 years ago, however, it would have looked more conservative because conservatives hadn't quite radicalized yet.",

            "comment": "Gorsuch's example below really cuts to the heart of the Court's reasoning. Title VII prohibits firing someone on the basis of \"sex\" (but not sexual orientation).  However, Gorsuch's reasoning is that an employer who discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily discriminates on the basis of sex:\n\n&gt; Imagine an employer who has a policy of firing any employee known to be homosexual. The employer hosts an office holiday party and invites employees to bring their spouses. A model employee arrives and introduces a manager to Susan, the employee\u2019s wife. Will that employee be fired? If the policy works as the employer intends, the answer depends entirely on whether the model employee is a man or a woman. **To be sure, that employer\u2019s ultimate goal might be to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. But to achieve that purpose the employer must, along the way, intentionally treat an employee worse based in part on that individual\u2019s sex.**\n\nThe Court sidestepped the argument over what \"sex\" means:\n&gt; Appealing to roughly contemporaneous dictionaries, the employers say that, as used here, the term \u201csex\u201d in 1964 referred to \u201cstatus as either male or female [as] determined by reproductive biology.\u201d The employees counter by submitting that, even in 1964, the term bore a broader scope, capturing more than anatomy and reaching at least some norms concerning gender identity and sexual orientation. **But because nothing in our approach to these cases turns on the outcome of the parties\u2019 debate, and because the employees concede the point for argument\u2019s sake, we proceed on the assumption that \u201csex\u201d signified what the employers suggest, referring only to biological distinctions between male and female.**",

IANAL, but that seems pretty clear cut to me that she was fired based on her sex.  \n\nIt's also awesome how they have, to my understanding, reworked sexual orientation as it applies in law: homosexual and heterosexual are not valid(?) orientation terms.  Instead, \"attraction to X\" is the way they looked at the issue.  So if you fire a gay man, you're firing him because he's a man whose orientation is *attracted to men*, so by that criteria, you also need to fire all the straight women.  Essentially bringing the issue to \"person of sex X who holds opinion/belief Y,\" which is very protected by law.",

If you're fired and you believe it was because of your sexual orientation or transgender status, you can bring a claim saying your rights were violated under Title VII. That is **huge**. No, it doesn't mean you'll win your lawsuit. No, it doesn't mean you'll be able to prove it if you're lacking any evidence. But the legal protection for the LGBTQ+ community is huge. This decision is a very big deal.\n\nIf you're interested in this, I suggest waiting a few hours and looking for analysis of the opinion. There are usually some blogs and other analysts who will answer these \"real life\" questions.",

At the end of the school day on 9/11 I was pulled away from my classroom and promptly suspended for social media misuse. They said that they had discussed that my social media was in violation and decided to terminate my position at the school. The only time I was talked to was about my pride photos. Finally people who are or will ever be fired for unjust actions related to their sexuality will be justifiably safe. A year too late for me but not to later for others.",

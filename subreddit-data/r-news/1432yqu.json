Well if a society slowly changes it's traditions/ideals/values over time you have basically two options.  \n\n**Option 1:** Roll with the punches and accept the changes as they come.  Which essentially means you abandon conservatism since you're no longer committed to those old values/traditions. Hard to remain committed to values/traditions if you're constantly shifting them as time progresses.  \n\n**Option 2:** Fight against the changes, even if other people want them. But other people want to follow different traditions/ideals/values how can you stop them?  \n\nYou can talk to them and try to convince them to not change things.  But that likely won't do much since words don't really stop people.  \n\nYou can ignore them, which works well enough for you personally.  Others can change their values but you can remain steadfast in yours.  But that also means you may run into issues where your old values and their new values clash.  That may cause some discomfort, especially if the amount of people who follow the new values eventually outnumber you and people following the old. You also have the issue of your values no longer being passed on to future generations if they are chosing to adopt the oppositions values.  You slowly have to watch what you view as \"right\" be passed over for another way of living.\n\nSo what else can you do?  Force everyone to kowtow to YOUR values, even if they don't want to.  And this is what modern American conservatives have largely chosen.  \n\nHistory about minorities and their (mis)treatment is being taught in American classrooms?  Gotta fight against it.  \n\nPeople are learning that LGBTQ people are just human beings living their lives?  Not on their watch.\n\nThey basically feel they HAVE to control others because they know that allowing things to continue unchecked just means their values/traditions are eventually going to disappear.",

They \"won\" by repealing Roe, and that's where their major problem comes in. They drew millions of single issue anti-abortion voters every election. It was a core of their campaign strategies, talk about how their votes were needed to stop the baby murderers. Then they ended up like the dog that caught the car. They actually managed to get all the pieces in place and repeal RvW. \n\nThat presents an issue, because the only reason they were competitive is that they had millions of religious people voting for them solely to repeal RvW. That was their one and only reason for showing up to every election. Now that those people saw the goal as accomplished, there was no reason for them to go out and vote anymore. They didn't care about any of those complicated economic and social bills, they just wanted to stop the baby murder (and punish some immoral godless women). So they needed a new moral panic to drive these same people back to the polls, because without them they can't be competitive. The past few years has been them experimenting with what will scare those people. CRT was what they went with for a while, but that kinda fizzled out when it became extremely clear that it wasn't really a thing that was happening and most people thought it was stupid. Trans people and by ignorant extension drag is where they've landed as being the best combination of different and unusual enough to be presented as scary, while rare enough that they can't fight back and most people are unfamiliar enough that they can make up anything they want and people will believe it. The trans target has slightly opened up avenues to go after other parts of the LGBTQ spectrum, as they can make rules and laws claiming to target trans people while also impacting other groups they dislike.",

This field has been empty for over twenty years.  It is viewable from exactly one road.  The project was underway when it ground to a halt because one woman decided she didn't like it.  And for whatever dumb fuck reason the city council decided that was enough to halt the project and hold a town hearing about it for her and a few others to voice their concerns.  Their primary concern was the project was an eyesore from their homes.  They went at length about how they didn't want to have to look out their windows at that, and they were never notified it was going to be constructed 'in their back yard'.\n\nFinally, after they bitched for a good thirty minutes, another guy stands up and introduces himself as all their neighbors and that they live about ten miles away from the solar farm site.\n\nWaste of time and money.\n\nBut this is what they do.  They insert themselves into issues they have zero business being in.",

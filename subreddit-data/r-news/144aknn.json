It\u2019s like the difference between using something to make fun of something else and making fun of what you\u2019re mimicking, as was the distinction in the \u201cparody\u201d of Dr. Seuss making fun OJ Simpson.\n\nYou have to make fun of that work, and use the elements of that work to do so. Additionally, the Supreme Court appears that it may be making a distinction between what you can do with a trademark and what you can do with copyrights in this case; I need to review it more.",

It's simply saying that VIP can't just get out of jail free and needs to actually litigate the issue because the \"Rogers\" test doesn't apply - because VIP is using the \"parody\" elements as a source identifying trademark. \n\nThey're not ruling that there is a likelihood of confusion here. This ruling is narrow on the application of a certain circuit precedent, and IMO the correct one.\n\nPeople really need to stop commenting on nuanced legal issues without a) reading the opinion, and b) having some legal background.",

The three pharmaceutical companies that manufacture insulin\u2014Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi\u2014rake in billions in profits annually from insulin sales alone, with the U.S. market accounting for 15 percent of global insulin users but almost 50 percent of its worldwide revenues. Insulin ranks among each company\u2019s top-selling drugs; one BMJ study showed that prices could be slashed considerably and the drugs would still be profitable.\n\nhttps://prospect.org/health/insulin-racket/\n\nAs well as this one on how big money and finance captured the pharma industry: \n\n&gt;\tIn truth, the pharmaceutical industry in the United States is largely socialized, especially upstream in the drug development process, when basic research cuts the first pathways to medical breakthroughs. Of the 210 medicines approved for market by the FDA between 2010 and 2016, every one originated in research conducted in government laboratories or in university labs funded in large part by the National Institutes of Health. Since 1938, the government has spent more than $1 trillion on biomedical research, and at least since the 1980s, a growing proportion of the primary beneficiaries have been industry executives and major shareholders. Between 2006 and 2015, these two groups received 99 percent of the profits, totaling more than $500 billion, generated by 18 of the largest drug companies. This is not a \u201cbusiness\u201d functioning in some imaginary free market. It\u2019s a system built by and for Wall Street, resting on a foundation of $33 billion in annual taxpayer-funded research.\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/149438/big-pharma-captured-one-percent",

Since the article specifically mentions the monthly co-pay, I assume this is a regulation on insurance providers, not on manufacturers (who likely aren't located in Virginia anyway).  So what happens when the pharma companies choose not to lower their prices to insurers in Virginia?  I think we all know the insurance companies aren't going to just eat the extra cost, so I guess they'll just be raising general rates for all policy holders in Virginia to offset it?\n\nPlease note that I'm not necessarily criticizing the new Virginia law here.  My wife and sister are both insulin-dependent diabetics so I'm acutely aware of the problem, and I'm inclined to place the lion's share of the blame on the pharma manufacturers.

ACA forces insurance companies to use at least 80% of premiums to paying for patient care. If they use less than that, they have to send you a refund. That destroys profit margins and they hate that.\n\nBut if you ask half the country what Obamacare does, they think it's the devil's work. If you ask them what Affordable Care Act is, they don't know and think it sounds like a great solution to a problem with the current system. \n\nThis is the bullshit misinformation campaigns and bipartisan politics that is tearing our country apart. Instead of making things better for everyone, it's a smear campaign 24/7 for years.",

The manufacturer sets a price when they sell to the wholesalers and the wholesalers will set a base price for the pharmacies.  Both the wholesalers and pharmacies can get rebates based on quantities.  Most prescriptions are covered by prescription insurance, PBM.\n\nThe PBM will pay the pharmacy an agreed upon price per contract.  That price may or may not cover the entire cost.  Months later the PBM will demand some of the money back.  Since these are branded products, the pharmacy will be lucky to break even.  The manufacturer oftentimes will rebate the PBM for their product to be preferred.  The PBMs get a significant discount from the manufacturers.  \n\nIn my eyes, as a pharmacist, the true villain in this story is the PBM.  The entire pharmacy community was overjoyed that the US Supreme Court ruled state level regulation of PBMs is legal.  The Arkansas law may not be the best law but it is a start.  This will hopefully stop the potential collapse of an industry by stopping the abuse.",

Clearly US states are doing what they can to limit predatory pricing, but there is a pretty easy solution here at the macro lvl. The federal government spends billions on insulin support programs every year. It would be cheaper to regulate the suppliers",

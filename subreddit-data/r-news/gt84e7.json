He was a secret drinker, a mean one, and he looooved his gun.  Things got physical even *before* the wedding.  Of course he apologized and promised not to do it again.  And, of course, he did.\n\nHe slapped her, punched her, dragged her out of the car once and repeatedly slammed her head into the road, and nearly strangled her to death.  When I was eleven he handcuffed me outside on the front deck during a violent thunderstorm, for \"getting on his nerves.\"  My mom had to wait until she had enough hours at work to make it financially before she could initiate divorce proceedings.  When she did, she went to one of the county magistrates to ask for a protective order (restraining order).  Even with the protective order he found ways to intimidate us.  We lived up a holler (a long private road) and I had to walk it every morning and evening to get to and from my school bus stop.  He would park along the holler road and lay his service weapon on the dash of his car, and stare daggers at me as I walked by.  In one of their last conversations he threatened to break in some night, tie my mom and I up, douse the place with gas and set the house on fire.  He said he'd wait until the flames were very near us and then he'd commit suicide, leaving my mom and I to burn to death.  \n\nYeah, he was an absolute peach.\n\nNot too surprisingly I'm very afraid of cops.  It's a knee jerk reaction to the uniform.",

We ended up getting a bunch of cool shit, like 50 dollar gift cards for each kid, and random gifts. I bought Harvest Moon  for the N64 at a fred meyers, it was fuckin rad. Well, it must have been funded by the local police and fire Department. Which is cool as well, our local news station ran a segment, which showed the  police officers and firemen bringing all these gifts into our small apartment. It was all really great. But one cop kept in contact with my mom, and they ended up going out on a few dates. He was higher up in the department, at least thats what I remember from 15+ years ago. She stopped dating him after a few months. We had been through domestic violence as a family before. It was the main reason we needed help for christmas. When everybody asked her why she stopped dating this man that helped bring us christmas her reasoning was if he beat her, who would she call? He seemed like a great dude to me, and I haven't thought of this since it happened.",

I was the only Male of the four children so he nearly always took out aggression on me. As I got older in my teens, he began to taunt me with hitting my mother and sisters to provoke a reaction. Eventually after witnessing a few incidents he took it to far. One day I came home late after curfew 10pm. He was incensed and choked me and stepped on my throat while I was sleeping later that night. My mom heard and ran into the room to stop him. He slapped her so hard her head bounced off the drywall. My younger sister by two years came out with the phone and said \"911 its dialing\". This never happened, he always threatened the world if we called. We would go to jail, he would lose his job and we'd be homeless, they would believe us, etc... He fake punched my sister and she didn't flinch. She called him a coward, and he lost it. He then grabbed her neck. I remember very little of that night. But, I do remember me lunging at him and getting him into a chokehold in my sisters doorway.  I remember him struggling and almost getting loose. Just then my dog Scamp grabbed a death hold of his thigh and tearing him to shreds. I also remember moments later us all, dad included, sitting in the living room. He was afforded by my mom to leave and never come back. He left.",

Killed a black guy? Pssshhhh. People filmed it? Not worried about it; I'm a white cop. I legitimately bet he didn't think much of it for the first 12 hours or so, then, slowly, news spreads around the country, and within 24 hours, the city you \"protected\" is being burned because you're an ignorant idiot. I just wonder if any of it has hit him yet, or if he just sort of rolls his eyes at the \"overreaction\". Or, let's assume he did know he was fucked when he left his shift. Imagine that too. Ever sit in your bed at night and suddenly realize an error you made on the report you sent your boss before you left work? Imagine a similar feeling times 1000. Now, also imagine George Floyd. Imagine if a little bird or angel or whatever you believe in had been able to tell him that his death was going to spark a national response. Imagine how jarring and overwhelming it would be for Floyd to know his death has caused this.",

I just hope he stays too broke to go to the academy because I feel like he would just be looking for an opportunity...",

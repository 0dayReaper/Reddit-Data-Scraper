Paying for their goods/services doesn't give us some upper hand. It's actually our ability to not pay for their goods/services that gives us the upper hand as consumers--assuming it's a good/service we can replace with a competitor, which sometimes it isn't (ie ISPs in certain locales). In those cases, we can still technically take our money away from the business, but we'd be kind of left up a creek ourselves by doing so.",

This means Time Warner's media content has to compete in an open market instead of unfairly capturing a locked in audience consisting of Spectrum internet customers.\n\nThis is very much a simplified description so take it with a grain of salt just like everything else on the internet.",

Trump bumped him up to Chairman (also probably on McC's reccomendation, because I Can't imagine Trump actually being cognizant of what is going on outside his immediate yes-men)I'm honestly a little surprised he's leaving, as he technically has the seat through June of 2021. Per u/somnif\n3.\t My comment is not for arguing for or against net neutrality or the outcome of what happened. Only that this was the first person of what would become many political people I learned of because of their vile decisions, corruption, or stupidity that became so much more obvious and public during these last 4 years. Before 2018  the only real political person I knew was the secretary of education with Obama but only because they shot hoops together",

At the same time, I think people really underestimate a) how incredibly much people drank back then and how many died from alcohol-related illness and injury; US drinking levels never \"recovered\" from Prohibition, and b) how utterly unremarkable it was for a man to get drunk and spend his whole paycheck on Friday or Saturday night, leaving his family unable to make rent or buy food, and then come home and beat and rape his wife and maybe kick the shit out of the kids as well.  \n\nThe drunk part of the equation was really the only part where women could take action.  They could wrap themselves in scripture and preach against liquor, but there was no way in 1920 they could have advocated for women's financial rights or the criminalization of marital rape.  Prohibition was the only solution available to them for some very real problems; it also caused a lot of other problems, and, eventually, women were also instrumental in its repeal on the grounds of moral and legal hypocrisy.  \n\nI'd recommend the Ken Burns documentary if you've got a few hours to spend on the subject.",

He's essentially conflating the two, casting all white folks as being rich. This obviously isn't the case.\n\nLiving in the poor areas of a big city (out of necessity) will teach you very quickly that skin color is just one factor, and certainly not one that provides any measure of safety. Depending on the area, it can also be hazardous to be white - though I'll leave it at that, since it's a rather taboo subject.\n\nI do think that we need better controls on the possession and carry of deadly weapons. Just looking at the crime rates involving firearms as compared to other countries with stricter controls makes that very clear. But we also need to make sure that we're not just stripping the poor of the ability to defend themselves, their families, and their homes.\n\nThis is just one part of a large, interconnected mess of problems that we have. Poverty, violent crime, racism and mental health issues are all related to each other, and I don't think you can talk about a real solution to any of them without talking about the others as well.",

As the article mentions, Iraq is dealing specifically with fallout and instability from the war on terror. The Christian population that natively spoke Syriac is emigrating, diluting the number of people who speak it. Once a language is only used in smaller subset of your overall community, people tend to lose it and adopt the more common language. You\u2019ll have situations where kids will only speak their ancestral language at home and a different one everywhere else. They are then less likely to have that be a household language when they have kids.",

I've had people ask if I'm half black, Mexican, Spanish (I confused the crap out of everyone when I took a trip to Spain because I can speak an ok amount of Spanish, especially when I'm initially asking a question, but then I'd get the response and be like give me a second to process what you said), Siberian, Lebanese and Greek are probably the two most common ones and closest. If you think about the cradle of civilization and all that, historically Assyrians are close to that era so it makes sense we look like a lot of other ethnicities.",

The [Assyrian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_language) (often referred to as [Assyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suret_language), [Syriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_language), Chaldean, or [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic)) is an ancient [Semitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages) language that was spoken by [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus). It was once the [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca) of the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East).

Today, outright suppression is no longer the single biggest threat to the survival of the Assyrian language. The large-scale forced [displacement of Assyrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_exodus_from_Iraq) from our homeland in recent decades has led [significant numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian%E2%80%93Chaldean%E2%80%93Syriac_diaspora) of Assyrians to [migrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration) and [assimilate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation) into new communities with new languages, where preservation is a challenge. \n\nIn our native territories, this [population drain](https://twitter.com/assyrianpolicy/status/1360288881200009219?s=46&amp;t=YUZdymQaiwXoFyDOmlyl3Q) is having a devastating effect on the Assyrians\u2019 critical mass, and our ability to maintain and preserve our ancient language for future generations. The lack of proper governmental/[political representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_representation) and official recognition by some states in which we live also make this endeavor particularly difficult. For example, while Iraq no longer practices a policy of forced assimilation of non-Arabic speakers, Assyrian linguistic rights are often compromised as there is little incentive to learn how to read and write a language for intrinsic reasons with no external use. Furthermore, Assyrian language/curriculum schools are also underfunded and intentionally disadvantaged in an effort to encourage Assyrian parents to send their children to Arabic or Kurdish language/curriculum schools instead. Thus, the Assyrian language is systematically rendered unviable.",

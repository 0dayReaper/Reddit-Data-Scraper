It\u2019s amazing to me that Tijuana can sit right across a border from a city like San Diego and be so vastly different.",

Firstly, these cartels operate like highly organized criminal networks with vast resources, including weapons and money, making them a formidable force to combat. Moreover, they manage to infiltrate government institutions and law enforcement agencies, leading to corruption and compromised investigations.\n\nSocioeconomic factors also play a significant role. Poverty, inequality, and limited opportunities drive individuals towards engaging in illegal activities as a means of survival or financial gain. Tackling these underlying issues is essential in addressing the root causes of cartel influence.\n\nThe cartels themselves resort to extreme violence and intimidation tactics to maintain control over territories and discourage individuals from reporting crimes. This atmosphere of fear makes it challenging for communities to cooperate with law enforcement agencies.\n\nAlso, the international dimensions of the drug trade complicate matters. The networks involved span across multiple countries, necessitating collaboration and cooperation among nations to effectively disrupt their operations.\n\nTo combat cartels and associated crime, a comprehensive approach is needed. This approach includes strengthening institutions, promoting economic development, tackling corruption, fostering international cooperation, and prioritizing the safety and well-being of affected communities.",

It feels similar to Israel - there\u2019s definitely a higher military and police presence than many places, but nothing actually feels off or unsafe.

It was a little sketch getting into the blacked out SUV that took us to the resort but I speak Spanish so I just talked tot he driver. The locals really care about the tourist. We went with two other couples. One day we went to isla de mujeres and took a taxi down. And taxi back to the hotel. They sign everyone in and out. The drivers have to show ID\u2019s and present your names etc when they take you in and out of the resort. I was born in TJ and have been back to visit several times before Covid. Our family is always with us and we stay with them way off the city center. \n\nYou def need to have a good sense of your surroundings. There is a lot\nOf visions from all over that visit Mexico. We did not go to any clubs or anything.",

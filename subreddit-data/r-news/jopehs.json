The goal is to overwhelm the news cycle and cast doubt on the process as a whole.\n\nThe result being the average person sees a slurry of lawsuits, many people, especially his base, are likely to put more stock in the conspiracy theories of fraud.\n\nIts all to prime the american people for the trump campaigns future moves... One horrifying possiblity is that he'll get Republican legislators and/governors to send **alternate sets of electors**... When you vote, you're really voting for electors, people who cast the final vote and actually decide the presidency. And they don't actually have to follow the will of the people. State governments can intervene and send entirely different electors (and additional electors)... Its Trump's best shot at overturning the results... Sources have previously said that the trump camp has already been looking into this route.\n\nThat tactic would cause a full-blown constitutional crisis. Meaning the constitution has literally no remedy to decide the president.",

The Constitution allows the tactic you're describing, explicitly. It's the move the Electoral College *exists* for.\n\nThere's no surer way to instigate a full-blown civil war, however.

Deutsche Bank calling his loans, reposessing his hotels. irs audit dept will have more funding, Trump will lose the audit case. irs loves to jail celebrities. Ny state going after him. \n\nThis is a man against the wall. He either faces a complete personal collapse or he creates a civil war, and Trump is a narcissist. Which option do you think he'll choose?\n\nEdit - having said that, it's practically impossible to do this coordination given democrat governors in the battleground states.",

How does it work?\n\nEdit: I want to point out that while electors have somewhat just been symbolic, there were 10 faithless electors in 2016, where some of them belonged to a Republican faction that had seeked to prevent a Trump presidency.\n\nLast I had heard, the Supreme Court ruled that electors were subject to state laws, but it's possible that that has changed. Some people are telling me that faithless electors are unconstitutional which I'm not sure that they are.\n\nSome people have brought up Chiafalo which deals with the cases in 2016. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like in that situation, it was simply ruled that despite the US constitution claiming electors can vote for whom they wished, the States reserve the right to deal with their own faithless electors. In the 2016 cases, it seems like they got a $1000 fine and may have also experienced ramifications from their party. Still that seems like a small price to pay for affecting the US presidency.\n\nApologies if I'm mistaken about anything, I'm not American.\n\nEdit 2: It seems like many states have laws that include replacing the votes made by faithless electors?",

There is absolutely no evidence that any of these ballots are fraudulent, let alone 100\u2019s of thousands of them. That\u2019s the thing about courts, thankfully they require evidence... not just wild, baseless claims of some widespread conspiracy that you made up because you\u2019re losing.",

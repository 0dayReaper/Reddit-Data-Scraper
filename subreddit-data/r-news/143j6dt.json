Usually this is associated with sending polar vortexes in the winter down as far as texas but in this case is sending wildfire smoke down. The cause is theorized to be the warming arctic not providing a big enough of a temperature difference to keep the jet stream stable. The [NOAA](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/understanding-arctic-polar-vortex) has a whole page about it if anyone reading this wants some further reading, but even that link which is the most thorough one I've found expresses a lot of uncertainty just because of, again, how new all this is.",

You could not see ground level downtown from across it. Just brown fog. I could see the tops of our tallest buildings, like big pink.\n\nThe air quality was not just breaking records locally but it was more or less off the AQI scale. Uncharted.\n\nYou could go outside and hold out your hand - and if you looked closely at the larger pieces of ash that landed on you, you could see the remains of charred leaf structures.\n\nI'm not saying this to point out that 'we had it worse' or anything like that, so much as that we understand how absolutely apocalyptic it feels for the streetlights to be on in the middle of the day because smoke is obscuring the sun.",

The worst was the Camp Fire (Paradise, 2018), our town is 20 miles from Paradise and it turned us into mars for a week. Smokey weather is depressing as hell, I sympathize with all those affected.",

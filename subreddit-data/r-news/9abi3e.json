I really hope her grandkids (and me) helped ease her mind. We got a lot closer her last few years, and I think that was a security to her. I paid attention when the other adults didn\u2019t, and I listened to all her stories that she had told a thousand times (with awe, she was a fabulous storyteller). It\u2019s been 14 years, and I still miss her every day. ",

How does one... ask for that? *Can* you ask for that?\n\n\nI watched my great grandfather drag on for half a year in pain (at the age of 103) and by the last few days, he was crying because he wanted to die so much, and the pain was so bad. He was pretty much mostly blind and deaf, with most of his memory gone at the end. He was only alive because there was no legal way for him to end things.\n\nEdit: based on the responses, at the very very end (as in last week of his life) it seems like he was getting 'comfort care'. He wasn't conscious much because of the medication, but it was preferable to him being awake and in pain from the feeling of his body lying in a heavily padded bed. ",

At our hospital, the decision can be made to make a patient comfort care only, which another commenter mentioned. There's a whole order set, which includes being able to give morphine every 30 minutes (normally every 4 hours in a patient not on comfort care) and no invasive procedures/blood pressure measurements. And then if a patient starts showing signs of air hunger, we can make the decision to start them on a morphine drip. While this might not hasten a patient's death, this can help ease some of their discomfort.",

He did 5 years in prison, where torture wasn't just commonplace, but expected of the guards. Back in the day as well. No calls home, I can't imagine the \"food\" and how scarce it was, or the bed/room/accommodations respective conditions were. \n\nNow to really set this the fuck off... Imagine the not knowing. If you don't see light at the end of the tunnel you start to flip the fuck out. A jail here has a start and end. There was no end date to that, and 5 years of that hell, never knowing if you'll die there, or even get out and see your family again would honestly destroy most minds. That is so very fucking much to mentally handle. So you hope every goddamn day when you wake up, that this will be the one day you finally get the hell out. Except repeat that at least 1825 times, or mornings. Keep that blind level of hope day in, day out, when you know damn well death maybe the reason you meet your last day in there, under complete shit conditions that are MEANT to break you well over one thousand eight hundred and twenty five times. Most people will never, thankfully, go through a fucking hell like that, so they cannot understand what it's like emotionally, but I am asking you to think about it just from the logic side of things and the see the sheer scope of things JUST over a 5 year (feels like 500) period of time, just to come back and be a senator. A senator that's not super rich or lavish. He stuck to his beliefs and there were reasons for those beliefs. We do not all agree, never will, that is part of being different. Thing was he stuck to his beliefs regardless of what his party's wishes were. He was not a follower in that sense at all. \n\nI voted for him when he ran, because when I was in the Marines around 2000 he was a senator that really stuck out as someone who would give good troop support. And knowing what the bad side of war could be like, he didn't seem like the type to throw us around anywhere there was a pissing match, complete with our own weapons to fight against. It wasn't that I didn't like Obama, it was that he kept himself aligned with the \"make friends not enemies, but if you want to be an enemy he would not tolerate you attacking us, and will make sure the military coming at you is not just well trained, but well provisioned as well\" mantra.\n\nHe didn't put us in Iraq after 9/11 but he made sure, because we were already there, that he would support funding the military with what they would need. I figured he, like Obama, would finalize this Iraq thing, and get us home as well. I had said back then if he ran for president he had my vote. So I stuck to what I said and voted for him. Even though it'll piss some off by me saying this, it's the only time I have ever voted in my life. I am 39.\n\nRest in peace.",

            "comment": "\"But there's something underneath politics in the way you have to hear McCain, something riveting and unSpinnable and true. It has to do with McCain\u2019s military background and Vietnam combat and the five-plus years he spent in a North Vietnamese prison, mostly in solitary, in a box, getting tortured and starved. And the unbelievable honor and balls he showed there. \n\nIt's very easy to gloss over the POW thing, partly because we've all heard so much about it and partly because it\u2019s so off-the \u2013 charts dramatic, like something in a movie instead of a man's life. But it\u2019s worth considering for a minute, because it\u2019s what makes McCain's \"causes greater than self-interest\" line easier to hear.\n\nYou probably already know what happened. \n\nIn October of '67 McCain was himself still a Young Voter and \ufb02ying his 23rd Vietnam combat mission and his A-4 Skyhawk plane got shot down over Hanoi and he had to eject, which basically means setting off an explosive charge that blows your seat out of the plane, which ejection broke both McCain's arms and one leg and gave him a concussion and he started falling out of the skies right over Hanoi. \n\nTry to imagine for a second how much this would hurt and how scared you'd be, three limbs broken and falling toward the enemy capital you just tried to bomb. His chute opened late and he landed hard in a little lake in a park right in the middle of downtown Hanoi, \n\nImagine treading water with broken arms and trying to pull the life vest's toggle with your teeth as a crowd of Vietnamese men swim out toward you (there's film of this, somebody had a home \u2013 movie camera, and the N.V. government released it, though it's grainy and McCain's face is hard to see). The crowd pulled him out and then just about killed him. \n\nU.S. bomber pilots were especially hated, for obvious reasons. McCain got bayoneted in the groin; a soldier broke his shoulder apart with a ri\ufb02e butt. Plus by this time his right knee was bent 90-degrees to the side with the bone sticking out. Try to imagine this. \n\nHe finally got tossed on a jeep and taken five blocks to the infamous Hoa Lo prison \u2013 a.k.a. the \"Hanoi Hilton,\" of much movie fame \u2013 where they made him beg a week for a doctor and finally set a couple of the fractures without anesthetic and let two other fractures and the groin wound (imagine: groin wound) stay like they were. Then they threw him in a cell. Try for a moment to feel this. All the media profiles talk about how McCain still can't lift his arms over his head to comb his hair, which is true. \n\nBut try to imagine it at the time, yourself in his place, because it's important. Think about how diametrically opposed to your own self-interest getting knifed in the balls and having fractures set without painkiller would be, and then about getting thrown in a cell to just lie there and hurt, which is what happened. \n\nHe was delirious with pain for weeks, and his weight dropped to 100 pounds, and the other POWs were sure he would die; and then after a few months like that after his bones mostly knitted and he could sort of stand up they brought him in to the prison commandant's office and offered to let him go. This is true. They said he could just leave. They had found out that McCain's father was one of the top-ranking naval officers in the U.S. Armed Forces (which is true \u2013 both his father and grandfather were admirals), and the North Vietnamese wanted the PR coup of mercifully releasing his son, the baby-killer. \n\nMcCain, 100 pounds and barely able to stand, refused, The U.S. military's Code of Conduct for Prisoners of War apparently said that POWs had to be released in the order they were captured, and there were others who'd been in Hoa Lo a long time, and McCain refused to violate the Code. \n\nThe commandant, not pleased, right there in the office had guards break his ribs, rebreak his arm, knock his teeth out. McCain still refused to leave without the other POWs. And so then he spent four more years in Hoa Lo like this, much of the time in solitary, in the dark, in a closet-sized box called a \"punishment cell.\" \n\nMaybe you've heard all this before; it's been in umpteen different media profiles of McCain. But try to imagine that moment between getting offered early release and turning it down. Try to imagine it was you. \n\nImagine how loudly your most basic, primal self-interest would have cried out to you in that moment, and all the ways you could rationalize accepting the offer. Can you hear it? It so, would you have refused to go? You simply can't know for sure. None of us can. It's hard even to imagine the pain and fear in that moment, much less know how you'd react. \n\nBut, see, we do know how this man reacted. That he chose to spend four more years there, in a dark box, alone, tapping code on the walls to the others, rather than violate a Code. Maybe he was nuts. But the point is that with McCain it feels like we know, for a proven fact, that he\u2019s capable of devotion to something other, more, than his own self-interest. So that when he says the line in speeches in early February you can feel like maybe it isn't just more candidate bullshit, that with this guy it's maybe the truth.\n\nOr maybe both the truth and bullshit: the guy does \u2013 did \u2013 want your vote, after all.\n\nBut that moment in the Hoa Lo office in '68 \u2013 right before he refused, with all his basic normal human self-interest howling at him \u2013 that moment is hard to blow off.\"\n\nFrom Rolling Stone \nby David Foster Wallace, 2000",

I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn\u2019t my own man anymore. I was my country\u2019s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My Mom voted for Obama, my Dad went for McCain, but I had a great respect for both. I think beyond just the knowledge of how great a man McCain actually was (his service, his candour, his pursuit of bettering this nation and those around him) is also the reality that it feels like this is the death of an era of America. I'll teach my children about individuals like John McCain as they grow up, that is something I am certain of. ",

Compromise is what this country is founded on, and it's the only thing that will keep it going forward.

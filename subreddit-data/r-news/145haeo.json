He worked as an overhead crane operator in a Steel Fabrication plant.

I was 12 when he went on oxygen he died 10 days before my 17th birthday. He went through 5 years of progressive misery.\n \nI went through a lot of verbal and psychological abuse because he was so miserable. I understand it now as an adult who raised kids. They can drive you nuts when you\u2019re healthy, imagine just trying to breathe and your early teenage son is acting like\u2026.well, an early teenager. Challenging, smart mouthing, all the things that kids normally do. \n\nI have long forgiven him and I hope that he forgives me.",

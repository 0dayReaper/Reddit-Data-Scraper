This wasn't even just one facility.. we had several clients seeing different providers that were all charging similar prices for equipment sold on Amazon for a fraction of the \"rental\" price. \n\nWith personal injury, the treatment is generally on an attorney's lien, and it eventually comes out of the settlement so a lot of doctors will pad their numbers to make the bill look larger because the higher the medicals, the higher the settlement... but this was just so outrageous that even *we* were shocked, and honestly appalled.",

Honestly, your system is beyond fucked up.\n\nI took a short time visiting nursing position at a small private hospital in California when I was fresh out of school.  The hospital was generally private pay and elite clients, but would occasionally take medicare clients when they had large amounts of unoccupied beds.\n\nThe majority of my rotation were run of the mill routine patients, but I had one Medicare patient who was terminal cancer and was not leaving that bed.  Going to leave it as vague as possible.  But lots of pain. They were up for their pain meds when another client rang (elective cosmetic procedure, day before surgery) and asked if someone could wash their windows. I advised that as soon as I was finished with one other client I would call to have housekeeping to come up.\n\nBy the time I had come back to the desk from the Medicare clients room I had a message to head down and see the floor manager.  There were two other hospital brass members in with her, I believe one was HR and one was a board member.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most surreal experiences of my life. Apparently that patient put in a complaint about the fact I didn\u2019t wash her windows immediately, and when I advised that I had needed to see another client, with terminal cancer, for pain management first, and it had been less than ten minutes since the request about the windows, I was advised that I needed \u2018to understand that this is a private pay client, not a Medicare patient\u2019.\n\nWhen I said; \u2018just to be clear, I\u2019m supposed to wash windows rather than treat the pain of a terminal cancer patient\u2019 I was not surprised at the response.\n\n\u2018Well we would never say that, you just need to understand what the priorities are\u2019\n\nWhen I said that I wouldn\u2019t prioritize a housekeeping responsibility over a dying clients pain I was given the remainder of the day off, followed by a notification from the agency I was employed through that they had cancelled my contract with four week severance.\n\nHonestly, it was helpful to me professionally as it led me to further education and I\u2019m now a primary care provider with a few reasonably nice walk in clinics in my hometown.\n\nBut seriously, get a single payer system. Fuck everything about your insurance system. It\u2019s insane.  Canada has longer wait lists for some procedures, but no one needs to worry about becoming homeless because they broke a leg.\n\nOh, and fuck your price fixing pharmaceutical companies as well.\n\n[https://youtu.be/CeDOQpfaUc8](https://youtu.be/CeDOQpfaUc8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: I got a few notifications that were a bit angry questioning the veracity of the story and why I had been vague.  First, you sign confidentiality agreements when you're a healthcare provider, I believe I signed one for the nursing placement agency / headhunter and one for the facility; although it was almost two decades ago so I am really not sure off the top of my head.**  \n\n**In addition, I'm not going to 'out' my personal identity on Reddit as anyone with a licence issued by a professional college knows that complaints leads to suspensions during investigations, and I'd prefer not to have to worry about that.  In addition, moderating a gaming community over the last year has led to a few people that don't exactly like me, and I'm sure would love to send messages to friends, family and other individuals.**\n\n**Lastly, about the US system subsidizing advances in healthcare in other countries in the world; I don't necessarily disagree with you.  Canada allows an exclusivity period before other companies can manufacturer a generic version of a pharmaceutical where companies generally will recoup their R&amp;D costs, but it's a fair point.  My response is; why does a 40+ year old drug cost double now then it does 5 years ago?  How is having insurance companies, that exist as middle men, provide no direct services, and dramatically inflate pricing and costs, benefit the public or pharmaceutical R&amp;D?  How does the US benefit when an Israeli company triples the cost of a life-saving device (EpiPen) meanwhile you can buy it OTC in Canada for 30% of the cost (pharmacy adjacent to the clinic I'm presently in sells it for $108 OTC, $118 by prescription after dispensing free, they obtain them for $94.44).**  ",

To make it clear I'm talking about insurance companies and the financial side of things, being the reason we don't go, we're in part scared to go because we know its going to cost a bundle of money, and that cost is the difference between eating and paying bills for a large majority of Americans, most people ***can*** pay those ridiculous bills just not all at once but because those damn companies want all their cash asap the payment system is setup to be inflexible and to work out a payment arrangement you have to deal with a lot of crap to make it past the person checking you out to get a hold of someone from billing to work out a payment arrangement, its inconvenient by design.",

                                    "comment": "Not a doctor but it sounds like patellofemoral pain syndrome. Sometimes called \"theater knee\" I think. It's caused by arthritis behind the patella. When you sit, your knees are normally bent, pulling your kneecaps up against the joint. If you have any arthritis back there this can become uncomfortable. The pain is common while sitting in vehicles, at desks, in theaters, etc. \n\niirc it can be caused by many things, including your knees just getting old, but also arthritis caused by your kneecap not staying in its groove. If your inner or outter thigh muscles are out of balance, your patella can be pulled to one side and will track on the edge of the joint rather than down the middle.\n\nThe tricky part is you can't correct the imbalance with traditional leg workouts because repeated bending of the knee with this issue typically causes worse arthritis in the long term, and causes the knee to become inflamed until it locks up in the short term. So your options are isometric strength training or surgery for long-term correction. In the short-term, ice and anti-inflammatory medications help with the symptoms if you have to do something like go on a road trip or clean the gutters with a ladder.\n\nI'm sure there could be another explanation, but this issue is the only one I've heard of in which sitting causes knee pain but standing and walking normally don't.",

In order for the doctor to make money and make the customer visit worth while, they hike the price of the brace. The insurance rarely directly pays out their part of the bill - instead using coupons and other discounts as leverage on the bill.

I understand why the hospital is charging what it does. But if the insurance company is lying about how much they pay to the customer to get more money from them, that's fraud.\n\nIf I have car insurance, and I crash my car and I take my car to two shops, one quotes the repairs at $1000 for a new engine and the other quotes $100 because you really just needed a new gasket, but I submit the $1000 quote for the extra money, then that would be insurance fraud.",

I had already bought a knee brace at drug mart (no idea the brand, but it had metal side supports) before I arrived. Everything was inconclusive so I was given an anti inflammatory and an order to go to physical therapy. (Edit: if physical therapy is too painful or doesnt solve the issue I'll go back to get an MRI) He looked at my brace and was shocked that I actually had one that nice and it's very similar to what they give to patients. He then said to wear it if I'll be on my feet a lot. I spent $40 on it.\n\nEdit: and hey, I just got my eob for my visit. Total I owe coming out of my HSA, which is fortunately funded 10 times over my annual limit is:$226 for xray, physical exam, and prescription. ",

Took 30mins to see an ENT who looked up my nose and gave some feedback, asked if I had time to do a CT. Said sure, waited 20mins and had a CT then back to the ENT. He advised it was nasal polyps (skin growths) in my nasal passages that increase chances of infection and that's probably all it was. Surgery to remove them is an option, but he wanted to try medication and see if it gets better - gave me 3 months of anti-biotics, anti-allergy and something to help the mucus flow or whatever. Told me to come back in 4 and 8 weeks to checkup.\n\nFirst visit with a CT was $30, $15 for medication. Second/third visit was $12. If I had surgery with all the bits and pieces (medication, meals, overnight stay, etc), it would be under $150 total.",

Honestly, it's not even fully the hospital's fault since the problem with a multi payer system is that often reimbursement rates to hospitals vary depending on what insurance the consumer has. Until we have a fixed reimbursement rate for everyone or a single payer system, we'll never have proper menu-like prices that is useful for consumers in hospitals.",

Thankfully the hospital is non-profit, so they're fully cooperative with helping them not get plumaged deep into debt and is even working with their insurance, but holy God. I was there for 6 hours of their two night stay in within that time 4 different specialists came in.\n\nOur healthcare system is just so fucked. I was sitting on the floor with this same person when they had an attack after we left the hospital trying to decide if we should ride through it or call an ambulance and incur the costs. This is the second time I've had to weigh this decision, and both parties were not poor by any means.\n\nAgain, the hospital is working with them, but it could have just as easily been \"Here's a $7500 hospital bill for the tests and specialists that found exactly nothing, follow up with an equally as expensive neurologist, good luck.\"",

The majority of dental plans pay for two cleanings and one set of x-rays per year, and 50% for any work like fillings, crowns, and root canals - after your deductible. Plus, dentistry is a limited scope compared to everything that is included under health insurance. Mostly dentists do exams, fill cavities, do crowns and root canals, and orthodontists or dentists trained in orthodontics will do that kind of stuff. But that's a pretty defined set of procedures with pretty predictable costs. (I'm of course ignoring wisdom tooth extractions, because those are done by an oral surgeon and I'm not totally sure if that's actually under medical insurance?).\n\nSo there are some pretty good reasons why they are able to do this. A lot of dentists also don't bill, they just charge you your coinsurance or copay at the time of service, so you get the exact amount right there on the paper. i like it.",

And if the hospital does something that isn't approved by insurance, even in the best interest of their paitnets, oops sorry no reimbursement for you. Hospitals aren't the ones lobbying against universal Healthcare. Hospitals aren't the ones making you pay a monthly premium only to deny you your claims just because they didn't deem your treatment to be valid or necessary. Since when did insurance companies get the final say of what is \"valid and necessary\" instead of you and your doctor? \n\nPeople I know this comment is going to get lost but it's time to wake up and see who the real enemy is, they're the ones hiding behind the hospitals and the doctors they want you to believe are the bad guys.

            "comment": "While this is good step, it is attacking the problem from the wrong side. Before making hospitals post their prices, we should ban insurance to receive special discounts which artificially increase the process.\n\nWhat really happens is that insurance artificially increase all medical prices, they go to a hospital and claim that they are providing hospital with patients and deserve a discount, it is not uncommon that the discount can be even 80% off.\n\nSo the hospital then jacks up their prices to get what they originally asked for. When someone uninsured needs their services they need to ask the quoted price, otherwise insurance company can sue them for fraud.\n\nYou can look at medical bills and see how much insurance companies really price, usually the discount is labeled as \"adjustment\".\n\nNo one, except uninsured people pay those ridiculous prices, interestingly the prices after adjustments, while still a bit high are affordable if you don't have to pay insurance premium. The whole thing was set up, to make us need insurance for any healthcare needs.\n\nIf the insurance discounts are banned and hospitals start post the actual prices then posting prices would make sense. Until then we will be shopping between hospitals that charge $15 vs $10 for a cotton swab.",

For non-emergencies, making an appointment at an independent clinic is a much cheaper option anyway.\n\nI feel this is just theater that does nothing to fix the real problem.",

I wonder what). Her exact quote was \"You have done more to bring shame on the family than could ever have been imagined\"\n\nPrincess Margaret is dead now, but I'm pretty sure Andrew brought more shame to the royal family then Margaret could imagine. Then again, the royal family loves to bring down the women who divorce their royal husbands. No wonder Prince Harry left that place. Pretty sure they were against him marrying his wife. They'll protect their precious bloodline no matter what.",

Everyone knows who they are and the things they do and yet, nothing. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know who I\u2019m writing to. I just feel so alone and the only thing I can think to rationalize the things that are happening is that I\u2019ve gone insane.\n \nWhat cruel mind simulated such horror.

Remember the \"legitimate rape\" comments?\n\nA lot of this stems from people's fantasy that in any life threatening situation, they would fight back. See people who think in a mass shooter situation, they would be able to take the shooter down with their own gun.\n\nIn this mindset, people like to imagine they would fight back against any rape. Therefore, if someone didn't fight back, it must not have been forced.\n\nThis r/iamverybadass attitude only serves to shame and silence victims.\n\nEdit: TL;DR, The idea that a victim wouldn't fight back, implies that you might not fight back either, and being helpless like that is understandably terrifying. So it's easier to dismiss someone who didn't fight back as not really a victim.",

They wouldn\u2019t directly punish him with jail time, but by putting him in the middle of nowhere, with no power and minimal privilege. That\u2019s my hope, at least.",

They don't care about us and yet we worship them like fucking gods. Blackmail, pffft, my ass. Most of them are aware of or in on it. All the celebrities, all the politicians, all the royalty, all of them.\n\nThis isn't the tip of an iceberg, it's a foothill to a mountain range with a massive interconnected cavern system. Whenever one gets exposed the rest just cut ties and deny until it blows over and they can keep doing whatever afterwards. Going after them one at a time is not enough.\n\nBtw, the Bible has a mistranslated word. The part we've been told says God abhores homosexuality, yeah no. The term was actually referring to pedophiles. They swept that up hundreds of years ago and look where we are.\n(Fyi, I'm an Atheist)",

He gets treated like this EVERYWHERE he goes just because of who he is and not because of anything he's actually accomplished. It's probably something he's used to. \n\nAll this for a 30 minute visit to our company and because he was lucky enough to have slipped out of the Queen's vagina.\n\nI think when a person constantly gets treated well and extra special, even though they didn't accomplish anything, they begin to have a warped sense of entitlement, which is why it's easy for them to cross the line and easily abuse people who they think are below them.",

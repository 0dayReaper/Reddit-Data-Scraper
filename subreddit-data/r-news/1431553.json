In August 2022, voters in Western Michigan chose to defund their public library after a campaign organized by a conservative community group argued that a display of books showcasing LGBTQ+ characters and stories was \"grooming children for sexual exploitation.\"\n\nGrooming children has been happening in Christian churches for a long time! Parents often force church attendance on their kids: pedophilia runs strong in religious communities.",

So they pull out the book and start going down the list...\n\nWitches... Nope did that...\n\nDemons... Nope tried that...\n\nPedophiles... Nope did that, literally.\n\nSodom... Wait like Sodomy? Hey we got that in our libraries! Let's say that librarians and teachers are indoctrinating our kids to fuck them! That will scare people!\n\nWelcome to modern day religious scare tactics!",

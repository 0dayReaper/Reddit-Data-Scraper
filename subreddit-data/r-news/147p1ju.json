To evidence this claim, he puts forth the goa'uld's superior technology. O'Neill points out that the goa'uld didn't really invent anything, they just stole all the technology they have. To which the goa'uld's lawyer tries to counter that how the technology was acquired doesn't matter, what matters is that they were able to acquire it.  \n\n\nIt's the same self reinforcing hierarchy here. \"No handouts for thee, you must instead work hard. Handouts are fine for me because I worked hard (to get handouts).\".",

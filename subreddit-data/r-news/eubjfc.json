As a pilot myself, visibility was incredibly low and it looks like they flew into a mountain under IFR.\n\nEdit: listened to the ATC recording and after reading more about the flight, this pilot was trying to fly VFR under really low ceiling in a low mountainous region. \n\nThe clip I listened to was a transition from Burbank class C airspace to Van Nuys class D (my home airport). Van Nuys cleared the pilot to follow the 101 freeway, which is just south of the field, towards Camarillo. \n\nPresumably, the pilot was too low to receive traffic alerts and instruction from the SoCal radar center and that was the last he was heard of. \n\nConvinced this pilot tried to squeeze between the mountain and the low cloud layer. The helicopter they were in is multi engine and has an incredibly low mechanical failure rate. \n\nI\u2019m not going to blame the pilot without details but most aviation accidents are due to pilot error and the way this is developing is making me think that\u2019s the case here.\n\nEdit 2: according to reports, even LAPD helicopters were grounded due to weather this morning and they usually rotate 4 airships at all times.",

He also called out TMZ for being wildly inappropriate and said \u201cimagine finding out a loved one has died through social media\u201d, he has requested that people stop speculating who was on board and to keep their loved ones in mind.\n\nEdit: I watched the rest, this time the man that spoke before the sheriff came back (man with a grey streak in his hair, dark green shirt and dark skin):\nthey don\u2019t know anything for sure yet. They received the report 9:47 AM, arrived 8 minutes later and due to magnesium, the fire took one hour to extinguish. The coroner is on site with a team and they\u2019re working hard to get answers.\nThey don\u2019t know what happened, they don\u2019t know where the helicopter took off, they don\u2019t know for sure where it was going (these three questions kept being asked). It will take some time to identify everyone and to notify the next of kin, he once again stressed for people to stop speculating and to keep loved ones on mind. The area that they are investigating is \u201cabout an acre\u201d, that\u2019s also where they expect most debris to be at and where bushes were on fire.\n\nHonestly, it was him constantly repeating that they don\u2019t know what happened yet since the press kept asking the same questions. They also kept pestering him about \u201ctaking an hour to extinguish\u201d - but again, that\u2019s because of the magnesium.\n\nAfter that they called for a spokesperson that can speak Spanish and I turned it off.\n\n[Good news article here that has a better summary of the conference and updates](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas).",

We plummeted 20,000 feet before they got power back up, and then spent another 15 minutes at 10,000 feet with the most insane turbulence I\u2019ve ever felt trying to make it to another airport for an emergency landing. During that time when everything was dark and we were just falling, I was filled with intense fear and so many other emotions. Outside of the extreme fear and anxiety I was feeling, the only other thing going through my head was how can I say goodbye to my family. I was frantically trying to turn my phone on in hopes of writing a goodbye letter in my notepad and text messages in hopes that they would at least find it in the wreckage if we crashed. It\u2019s been over ten years now since it happened and I still get extreme anxiety anytime I\u2019m flying and we start to descend in altitude.  The first few years flying after that I needed to take large amounts of Xanax to even get on a plane.  Every time I read about a crash like this it brings back so much anxiety.",

Seniors are already larger than life to freshman but can you imagine having Kobe as your idol, 360 dunking IN GAME, taking Brandy to the prom etc. When I was a senior he would always hook the team up with Adidas gear and come visit Coach Downer once in a while &amp; give us a pep talk. He made me believe that anything is possible. \n\nThis news makes me sick to my stomach but I promise if Kobe could speak he would say don't be sad because he achieved all his dreams and then some. He would probably want us to focus on our own aspirations and pray for the families of the other four who died. He was as fierce a competitor you could find, but off the court was a gentleman, a beautiful dichotomy. RIP  I still cant believe it.",

Flight tracker data shows Kobe's chopper appeared to first encounter weather issues as it was above the L.A. Zoo. It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear.\nPlay video content\n\nFLIGHT TOWER AUDIO\nWe know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA.\nAt around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet.\nHowever, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 185mph.",

They use easy and simple graphical displays that color a section of track in-between two signals in real time. They usually do not allow two trains on the same section of track (like having one lane of a highway to yourself between exits).\n\nIn \"dark\" territory they do not have the ability to confirm the location of trains. These areas are a bit more manual and limited locations have to be tracked. In this case you have a stretch of highway from mile marker 50 to 100 but someone else is in 100-150 and you stop at 100 waiting to confirm they started 150-200.",

A cell phone-like device with GPS and data link in each cab, with a driver interface that tracks approximate train length (via driver input of number/type of cars). The cab device sends out regular updates (10 seconds? 30?) of vehicle location, speed, braking/accelerating and other useful info, and receives back info about other nearby trains, track sections status, speed restrictions, etc.\n\nThis is not high-bandwidth data, and could probably even be handled with minimal stationary infrastructure on a side-band of the existing train radio frequencies.",

GPS would be more than accurate enough IMO, the current system double checks the position of the train by seeing if the train shunts between the rails.\n\nMy best guess is they want a system that would work even in an apocalypse. Even in the CTC areas they could switch to radio or even hand written authority. The current system has battery backups and connections to hook up generators. \n\n\nUnfortunately almost every program or policy we have is because, \"The rules are written in blood\", not because it makes sense. :(",

The trains that run on these over 100+yo tracks have grown in size, and the tracks have not been properly maintained, time for inspections of trains for safety concerns have been drastically reduced, and the number of workers per train is reduced. \n\nAll these cost-cutting measures are causing derailments on the regular. These were all talking points of the rail workers' strike. But that strike was bulldozed because the trains needed to keep running. \n\nIt's a fucking mess",

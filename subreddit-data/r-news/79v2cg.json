It essentially added up to an additional thirty minutes of down time for them.\n\nSo I walked across the street to the gas station, bought a pack of candy cigarettes, and \"smoked\" with my co-workers outside. They thought it was awesome; my manager, not so much.",

Stay inside and work, little slave.",

It's the only way you can guarantee you'll get a break aside from the statutory half hour at lunch, and that's the same reason I started smoking. I strongly encourage those under me that don't smoke to take a 5/10 minute break every hour to just relax for a bit. If that was the norm, or even encouraged, I'd probably drop smoking in a heartbeat (or at least cut down massively). ",

The smokers on the night shifts were way too liberal with their breaks, even after repeated reminders that they were there to work. At one point we were backed up during the bar rush and I had nobody in the kitchen because they all decided to go for a smoke during the busiest point of the night, so I locked them out and took over the kitchen myself. They were pissed off, banging on the doors the entire time (so it was ten degrees below freezing, that's not going to kill you, I know for sure one of them had truck keys because that's where they smoke). Once the rush cleared out I handed them their stuff through the drive thru window and told them to go home and take it up with the store manager in the morning.\n\nI'd rather have no staff than unreliable staff. Smoke breaks were a strict 15 minutes twice a shift at pre-approved times after that, same as the coffee break time all the other workers got.\n\n*Edit because people are confused: this was at 2am, the lobby had been shut down since 11pm as it was a drive thru only overnight location so they couldn't just come in the front door. And I wasn't expecting this to blow up this much, so to quell the hate mail I'll just say this wasn't the first incident with my overnight employees abusing smoke breaks, and I'd received numerous complaints about fairness from the non-smoking staff. This is how I chose to handle it, nuance and situation aside, feel free to come up with some imaginary situation in which your hypothetical response is objectively better. Unfortunately I have better things to do this afternoon than defend how I handled a stressful situation over a decade ago to a bunch of wound up strangers on the internet, so I'm done here.*",

So 1/3 of the line was made up of people who were about to go to work, so to speak.

This is broken up into:\n\n\"Offgoing,\" which is where you have free time if you don't have other work to do. Some people, (electricians like me, auxiliary mechanics, etc) have lots of maintenance to do in that time. Some people (sonar technicians, other forward rates...) have little to none. So you could use this time to sleep too. \n\nand\n\n\"Oncoming\" which is where you should be sleeping. \n\nSo, depending on your job, you could sleep 12 hours out of every 18, or less than six. I actually was up for 61 hours straight once, because i was one of two people qualified to work on the oxygen generators and they needed a troubleshoot/repair. Your sleep also often gets interrupted by running drills where 100% of the crew must be awake.\n\nThere isn't so much a \"working day\" for most of the crew. It's really just an 18 hour day or \"watch rotation.\"\n\n&gt; I imagine such a schedule leads to a lot of fatigue which can be quite dangerous in that kind of environment, especially if you're looking after a reactor or something.\n\nYES YES YES YES YES YES YES \n\nYou, random internet denizen, understand better than most Admirals.",

Their son, Michael, was my dad's best friend, the best man at his wedding.  \n\n#\n\nThe year after my parents got married, Michael died in a car accident. He was never married and was an only child, and so Grandpa Ted and Grandma Lou were destined to not have grandchildren of their own.  \n\n#\n\nSo my siblings and I became their grandkids. It was years before I understood they weren't \"really\" my Grandparents, and why. They were the loveliest people and I miss them dearly.

I often overhear them finding ways of justifying how it's okay to make everyone around them breath in their second hand smoke. The risk of lung cancer, stroke, and heart disease you accumulate over time from being around a smoker is about 25% higher than if you weren't around a smoker. Really guys, if you're smoking in a public place, you're just being a dick. Make a real effort to move it away from other people. ",

Everyone else in the kitchen, besides me, smoked so he just took his break when the others weren't. \n\nAfter a year of working with him, it was slow and I went outside to hang out with him while he smoked. I found him kicked back in a chair by the dumpsters just hanging on his phone. Apparently he was never a smoker, but realized if he said he was he'd get a few minutes to get a breath of fresh air and chill. \n\nAfter that, I started \"smoking\"",

In a deflationary economy, you earn money in real terms just by storing cash under your mattress - there is no point buying things or investing unless you have to because everything will be cheaper next year. This is a death sentence for an economy that wants to grow and advance.  \n\nThe reason for why this is bad is pretty complicated, but among other effects you will see the increase of government and personal debt in real terms and a shrinking of the size of the economy. A worst case scenario would be a deflationary spiral, where financial institutions start to collapse due to all the bad debt that has to be written off.",

However, if you were a smoker, you got to take a 15 minute (or longer) break every hour, and no one would complain because all of the management were smokers, too. This not only meant that non-smokers ended up doing the majority of the work, but also that all of the smokers got favoritism because they spent literally hours a day hanging out with middle management.\n\nAlmost enough to convince a healthy young guy to take up smoking.",

Utah (Mormons) being the lowest followed California. States in the south and in the east have much higher rates of smoking. ",

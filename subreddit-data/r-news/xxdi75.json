It\u2019s good for the job market, good for gdp, good for tax revenue, good for individuals.\n\n\nEdit: source for my \u201cnearly 70%\u201d claim\n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/356939/support-legal-marijuana-holds-record-high.aspx\n\nEdit 2:  people are confused about the pardons. They aren\u2019t letting people out of federal prisons for weed possession, because people aren\u2019t in prison for weed possession. Peoples records are being cleared of something we are starting to consider not a crime.  Removing it from their record can be super beneficial for them, especially when applying for jobs and nearly anything else where you have to declare criminal history.\nAnd as I mentioned in another comment, The process to legalization is: 1. Pardon people convicted. 2. Reclassification from the Justice Department 3. Legalization.\nWe very well may only get the first two now but it sets the stage for #3 in the future.\n\nEdit 3: Text from the article people are commenting on without reading.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days, the office will implement a formal process to provide pardoned individuals with a certificate of pardon, she added.\n\nThe proclamation also formally restored to these individuals all the political, civil, and other rights that were denied to them as felons.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of people who were convicted for marijuana possession who may be denied employment, housing, or educational opportunities as a result,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy pardon will remove this burden on them.\u201d\u201d",

I would wager if they could, they would have outlawed alcohol in high amounts due to Alcohol's failed prohibition in the 1920s. As for tobacco in 1971, well that's a story in itself with how big tobacco was paying doctors to publicly say they were manufacturing \"healthy cigarettes\" and the immense lobbying efforts by them.",

Remember that at the polls this November.\n\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congress-found-an-easy-way-to-fix-child-poverty-then-it-walked-away/",

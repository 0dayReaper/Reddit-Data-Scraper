Biden wins the popular vote, and carries the key swing states of\u00a0Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and\u00a0Pennsylvania by decent but not\u00a0overwhelming margins.\n\n2. Trump immediately declares that the voting\u00a0was rigged, that there was mail-in ballot fraud and that the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0were behind a plan to provide fraudulent mail-in ballots and other\u00a0\"election hacking\" throughout\u00a0the four key swing states that gave Biden\u00a0his victory.\n\n3. Trump\u00a0indicates this is a major national security issue, and he invokes\u00a0emergency powers, directing the\u00a0Justice Department to investigate the\u00a0alleged activity in the swing states. The legal justification for\u00a0the\u00a0presidential powers he invokes has already been developed and issued by\u00a0Barr.\n\n4. The investigation is intended to tick down the clock\u00a0toward December 14, the deadline when each state's\u00a0Electoral College\u00a0electors must be appointed.\u00a0\n\n5. All\u00a0four swing states have Republican control of both their upper and lower\u00a0houses of their state\u00a0legislatures. Those state legislatures refuse to\u00a0allow any Electoral College slate to be certified until\u00a0the \"national\u00a0security\" investigation is complete.\n\n6. The Democrats will have\u00a0begun a legal action to certify the results in those four states, and\u00a0the\u00a0appointment of the Biden slate of electors, arguing that Trump has\u00a0manufactured a national security\u00a0emergency in order to create the\u00a0ensuing chaos.\n\n7. The issue goes up to the Supreme Court, which\u00a0unlike the 2000 election does not decide the election in\u00a0favor of the\u00a0Republicans. However, it indicates again that the December 14 Electoral\u00a0College deadline\u00a0must be met; that the president's national security\u00a0powers legally authorize him to investigate\u00a0potential foreign country\u00a0intrusion into the national election; and if no Electoral College slate\u00a0can be\u00a0certified by any state by December 14, the Electoral College must\u00a0meet anyway and cast its votes.\n\n8. The Electoral College meets,\u00a0and without the electors from those four states being represented,\u00a0neither\u00a0Biden nor Trump has sufficient votes to get an Electoral College\u00a0majority.\n\n9. The election is thrown into the House of\u00a0Representatives, pursuant to the Constitution. Under the\u00a0relevant\u00a0constitutional process, the vote in the House is by state delegation,\u00a0where each delegation\u00a0casts one vote, which is determined by the\u00a0majority of the representatives in that state.\n\n10. Currently, there\u00a0are 26 states that have a majority Republican House delegation. 23\u00a0states have a\u00a0majority Democratic delegation. Even if the Democrats\u00a0were to pick up seats in Pennsylvania and hold all their 2018 House\u00a0gains, the\u00a0Republicans would have a 26 to 24 delegation majority.\n\n11. This vote would enable Trump to retain the presidency.",

There will be high amount of people voting by mail, and the Trump appointed head of USPS has been cutting jobs and hours left and right to make the USPS slow to a crawl. So, many people may not get their ballots in by the election day. If the is a multi-day drawn out vote-by-mail count (since those mailed before election day still have to be counted), that is just more time for Trump to scream about voter fraud. Hell, they might even find a case or two of legitimate voter fraud (liky a fraudulent vote that is voting FOR Trump) and use that as the reason for the GOP and his supporters to not believe the election results.",

There is no extension, there is no \"emergency powers\" at that date he loses all legal power. And if he refuses to leave the office he can be evicted as a trespasser by federal marshals.\n\nThis scenario also results in a Democrat taking the Presidency because in this event the President becomes the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. Which is currently a Republican, but if elections somehow didn't happen that Senator's term ends. Most of the open seats are then in states with Democratic Governors who would appoint Senators to replace the expiring ones. That would give enough Democrats in the Senate that they become the majority, thus the President Pro Tempore becomes a Democrat and then becomes President.",

The Senate selects a vice-president\n\nIf Trump delays the election the most likely result is a Democrat President with a Republican Vice President.\n\nEven if an election is delayed under absolutely no circumstances would that mean that Trump remains president past his 4 year term.

His approval numbers have dropped by 4.6% since he was elected https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/\n\nI think the people who love him are just clinging out of fear. Some of them fear social changes (police reform, helping the unemployed), unfairness (\"How come I make less money than people at home?\"), having to follow rules (see: Covid), immigration, and some just fear anyone non-white being helped. \n\n\nNone of his voters seem to say \"he's doing great at this thing right now!\" (though many have fallen back on \"the economy was good before covid!\" ignoring that if Trump had been proactive, covid would be over and the economy returned to normal already).  Instead of loving him for his positive changes, they cling to him like kids hanging out with a school bully for protection. They want someone who beat down their enemies, even if their enemies are just people exercising their constitutional right to protest. \n\n\nWhat they don't realize though is the same thing democrats like me didn't realize under Obama: this will be worse next time. Obama expanded executive power to deal with political gridlock. Trump picked up that torched and swung it wildly, not for policy, but for self-preservation.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/the-strangest-thing-about-trumps-approach-to-presidential-power/562271/\n\n\nImagine the places this could lead to. If they think cancel culture is bad now, Trump has just paved the way for republican protestors to be kidnapped by DHS, beaten down, run over, and shot (they usually carry weapons to protest, after all) under democratic leadership that doesn't scale back presidential powers. If they think they could stop a democratic leader from using the office for literally taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor, or even themselves, they've paved the way for this exact thing to happen.\n\n\nI know a lot of people look at politics like team vs. team, but that mentality could literally lead to the end of America. Also, that's what Putin wants.\n\n\nIn 1997, a Russian political scientist named Aleksandr Dugin and a serving Russian General named Nikolai Klokotov sat down and wrote a text that would become the foundation of Russian geopolitical strategy over the next 20 years. It was called \u201cFoundations of Geopolitics\u201d and it was all about how Russia could reassert itself in the world.\n\n\nFor the U.S., the book mentions: \"Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke \"Afro-American racists\". Russia should \"introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements \u2013 extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics\"\n\n\nI honestly don't know how a country cuts off all misinformation, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and brainwashing from a voter base that now seems to identify solely by these things. And it's so many people. It's 40% of the country. At this point, Fox news could air \"the next civil war started today and it's time to take action\" and I honestly think all of their viewers would start loading their guns, even if nothing had actually happened at all. That's how blindly 40% of the country is being led around by the media.\n\n\nWe could start teaching kids critical thinking skills, media literacy (checking for credible sources), and how to deal with their emotions (to eliminate the effects fear-mongering), but 40% of the country's parents would think \"they're brainwashing my kid to be a liberal!\"\n\n\nFuck. Sorry for the rant. I feel like I'm watching Rome burning.",

So far, none have and I've been contacting the departments to find out why. One department has contacted back and said that they do reference checks and leaving not in good standing would be disqualifying, but I want to know why that isn't expressly stated.\n \nThe departments near me (and I'm assuming this is not unusual) require no less than honorable discharge from military; no felony conviction; no domestic violence conviction. But nothing about other law enforcement departments...my hope is that this can be changed. No one who was fired for disciplinary reasons should be allowed to be hired at another law enforcement agency and no one who is currently under investigation (but left on their own volition) should be hired unless the investigation cleared them of all wrong doing...it's such a ridiculously small step, but I'm feeling like it will still be an uphill battle \ud83d\ude14",

Even if they just dock their pay, that's basically admitting that they did something they weren't meant to.\n\nI feel like they really just need either an independent body that handles complains and wouldn't be a stakeholder in any lawsuits (like a federal body that doesn't care about the local state getting sued) or some kind of additional penalty or reassurances that makes cracking down on police abuse of power early on a much better legal deterrence than covering it up.",

Police officers have extra rights when they are fired because they are municipal/state employees. So they can request a hearing to override the firing. If they lose that, they can appeal it. If they lose that, they can appeal it again.\n\nIf the police use excessive force or deadly force, most municipalities will quickly settle out a civil case for cash. This doesn't affect whether or not a police officer is fired. That's a separate process.",

They speak to so many issues.",

Ther's definitely a part to be learned in the streets.\n\nOn the other side there is a huge amount of theorical knowledge that they should know which shouldn't be learn in the field but before : the knowledge of the law to be able to recognize where it is broken and where it is not, proper deescalation techniques, psychology training (you don't make people interact to that level with the public in tense situations without any psychological training, period.), social knowledge (including the role of institutions in the society), socio economic classes to understand better the context of the places they will be policing... etc\n\nAll of this is not supposed to be knowledge that you teach orally on the corner of a street. This is knowledge that has to be studied, and more importantly tested before gaining the privilige to go on the streets policing. Because it shouldn't be optionnal knowledge. If you fail to learn those, you fail and cannot be a policeman.\n\nAnd all of this is just impossible, if well done and teached (and not just barely mentionned), to do in 6 months.",

The type of people often drawn to that position wouldn't pass the test. And who does that leave? I'd wager an impossibly small force.\n\nI know it's a tough sell these days, but I've long maintained the belief that the police are underpaid, undertrained, and undereducated.\n\nI propose one relatively easy solution is to require a degree, and raise wages _substantially_. Make it the type of respected, good living job that a doctor enjoys. You know any family practice average city doctors? They're well off, well respected folks for the most part. We need to do that to the police. Because when being a cop is a job worth having, it will attract better, more qualified people.",

It takes 4 years of undergrad education and 3 years of law school, costing on average upwards of $200,000, plus the passage of the bar, simply to acquire the ability to properly give people legal advice. Yet it takes 8 weeks for police offers to gain the ability to enforce that law with deadly force. Who the hell decided that was a good idea?\n\n\nEdit: So touching on the 8 week part since a lot of people have asked where you can find an 8 week police academy. Louisiana! Louisiana\u2019s police training program is 360 hours or between 8-9 weeks. Other states vary quite a bit between 13-19 weeks. I used 8 weeks in my original post because it was prevalent recently in a lot of discussions regarding Drew Brees and his comments. Even so if you only look at the states on the high end of around 19 weeks. In comparison the average hair dresser needs to attend 12-24 months of training before they can cut hair.",

I also have $2 million in insurance for \u201cteaching malpractice.\u201d I am probationary for my first three years and have to take five specific college classes and a teaching test. I am re-evaluated nine times in my first three years by the school. Three times by the state. One time by the department of labor. And nine more times by OSHA. \n\nAfter my first three years I have to participate in 15 hours of continuing education pertaining to teaching (unpaid), I have to redo my 30 hour OSHA every five years, and I have to attend a professional conference annually.\n\nThis is all to teach a trade: video production. \n\nI think police officers should be licensed and insured. I know they have some continuing education but I think it should be less shooting and door kicking (I know it\u2019s more than this but that\u2019s all I see on social media) and more community engagement.",

When an officer or agency is sued, the current practice is that the public pays out the money for the settlement or judgment. Some portion of your property tax each year is the result of such cases. But why should you have to pay for something you didn't do, most likely don't condone, and almost certainly have no real power to prevent? That burden should be shifted to those responsible -the individual officers. \n\nThose who love letting the Market decide things will have to concede that this is a good way to reign in police brutality since problem officers will either be unable to get insurance or rising premiums due to malpractice will price them out of police work.",

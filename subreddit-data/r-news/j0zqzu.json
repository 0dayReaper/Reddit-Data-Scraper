No one I know, including people who work 2 and 3 jobs and have next to nothing, pay as little as Trump.\n\nBut talk to conservatives, and they'll tell you that the rest of us should coddle and powder the butts of the rich like Trump, merely because they're rich grifters. This guy owes hundreds of millions because he lives a lavish lifestyle like a king.\n\nSo, our Democracy has now become a monarchy? The hardworking people of this nation have to support the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous? Conservatives who froth at the mouth because a single mother has the audacity to buy a steak and an extra box of Little Debbies, who bitch and moan because they have to pay a few bucks in taxes a year so elderly disabled people can have health care, conservatives who scream like banshees when you talk about defunding the police are *perfectly fine* with supporting the life of a conman who fucks porn stars and grabs women by the pussy?\n\nCracks me up. Conservatives want to go back to having kings, like Grassley and McConnell. that we prop up with our blood, sweat, and tears. They don't care that people like Trump are living large as hell, living *large as hell*, and won't help fund police, firefighters, and other public safety functions. \n\nWhen did Conservatives becomes such fawning sycophants of the rich? I see Trump flags on the homes of the poorest people here in Appalachia. These people can barely afford shoes, ffs, but they're all happy to support their \"king.\"\n\nThis is amazing to me. Truly. I never thought I'd see the day so many people would worship the wealthy like gods, yet be bitter over ever having to do a thing for their fellow working class sorts. I understand the trustafarians and the hedge fund wolves and so forth worshipping this guy, but poor working class people are okay with paying more in taxes than a guy who lives like a god?\n\nlmao at the idiots. I can't help it. On another forum for politics, we're all just hysterically laughing at the poor deluded rubes who are saying \"This is fine.\" \n\nYet, when they look at their hopeless lives, they never blame the Grassleys or the McConnells or the Trumps of the world who don't ever pay their fair share and use our government and tax money to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor. The economically disadvantaged Trump supporters blame the immigrant and the lesbian and the atheist and the liberal who pay more in taxes than those rich slobs.\n\nIt's all so damned hilarious to me at this point, I can't stop laughing at Trump and his idiot fans. It's just too damned funny in that bizarre way that Pascale's standoff with the cops is cracking me up, too.\n\nWhat a timeline we live in. The comedy hits keep coming. Enjoy the humor, everybody. It's all we're getting out of this guy, so take what you can get.\n\nOn edit: Dayum, y'all! Step away for a minute to eat some corn flakes and look what happens. I love you guys, too. Now, gotta finish a piece on marketing with geofencing to pay them bills--including my income taxes...lol\n\nLove you for real for hearing me. Sometimes you post on here, and you think you're just shouting into the abyss. Now, donate to the food banks instead of my old crusty (but still cute) ass!\n\nEdit 2: tried to thank all of you, but really do need to get back to the grind. If I didn't message you, I still am appreciative of the lovely flair. Be good and don't let the rich fuckers get you down tonight! Hopefully, Trump &amp; Co,. are gonna go down in a blaze of unglory!",

In 2017, after he became president, his tax bill was only $750.\n\n\n\n* He has reduced his tax bill with questionable measures, including a $72.9 million tax refund that is the subject of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\n\n* Many of his signature businesses, including his golf courses, report losing large amounts of money \u2014 losses that have helped him to lower his taxes.\n\n\n\n* The financial pressure on him is increasing as hundreds of millions of dollars in loans he personally guaranteed are soon coming due.\n\n\n* Even while declaring losses, he has managed to enjoy a lavish lifestyle by taking tax deductions on what most people would consider personal expenses, including residences, aircraft and $70,000 in hairstyling for television.\n\n\n\n* Ivanka Trump, while working as an employee of the Trump Organization, appears to have received \u201cconsulting fees\u201d that also helped reduce the family\u2019s tax bill.\n\n\n* As president, he has received more money from foreign sources and U.S. interest groups than previously known. The records do not reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/us/trump-taxes-takeaways.html\n\nA visualization of trumps finances over time. \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes-timeline.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes",

Two years later, a Trump lieutenant testified that his worth had not changed much.^[[1](https://www.newsweek.com/2016/10/28/donald-trump-business-busts-victims-511034.html)].\n\nEventually, this decade of rapid, debt-fueled expansion Mr. Trump had built with leverage from his father\u2019s brick-and-mortar fortune began to fail, generating enormous losses and bringing him to the brink of personal bankruptcy in the early 1990s.^[[2](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-debt.html)]\n\n&gt;\u201cJust wait five years...

Faced with accusations of financial impropriety and an affront to his authority, Trump turned to Michael D. Cohen, a former personal injury lawyer who helped run a taxi fleet. He had already purchased a number of Trump properties and had persuaded his parents, in-laws and a business partner to buy apartments at Trump World Tower.^[[3](https://nytimes.com/2017/07/02/us/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump.html)]\n\nIn 2008, Affliction, a premier fashion label for men, announced its partnership with Donald Trump. Michael Cohen, who\u2019s official title at the time was *Executive Vice President &amp; Special Counsel to Mr. Trump*, was named Chief Operating Officer for Affliction Entertainment.^[[4](http://sherdog.com/news/pressreleases/Michael-Cohen-Named-COO-of-Affliction-13158)]\n\nAffliction and The Trump Organization presented their entry into the world of professional mixed-martial-arts (MMA) with its first event, \"Affliction Banned,\" which aired on July 19, 2008 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. \n\nThis event was headlined by Russian heavyweight Fedor \"The Last Emperor\" Emelianenko in association with M-1, against former 2-time UFC\u00ae heavyweight title-holder Tim \"The Maine-iac\" Sylvia (24-4).^[[5](https://gazeta.ru/sport/2012/08/kz_4722597.shtml)]\n\nIn 2011, Michael Cohen parlayed four Manhattan buildings for $11 million in 2011 and 2012 into cash sales totaling $32 million in 2014. The properties\u2019 values, as estimated by New York County tax assessors, had shown little change. Cohen bought one of the buildings for $2 million and sold it for $10 million three years later.^[[6](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article181133596.html)]\n\nIn early 2011, Donald Trump, and Michael Cohen among others, were accused of exploiting campaign finance laws by \u201ctesting the waters\u201d re: a 2012 presidential bid.^[[7](http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/13044334657.pdf)] Recall that the 2012 election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney culminated one evening when Obama lambasted Romney for asserting that Russia was the single greatest geopolitical threat at the time.\n\n&gt;\"When you were asked, what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said 'Russia.' Not Al-Qaeda; you said Russia,\" Obama charged. \"And, the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.\"^[[8](https://wwwcnn.com/2017/07/31/opinions/obama-romney-russia-opinion-drucker/index.html)]\n\nThis suit centered around the website [shouldtrumprun.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110429020811/http://shouldtrumprun.com/)\u2014created by Cohen the year prior\u2014asking people if Trump should run for presidency, utilizing divisive rhetoric and stoking conspiracy theories, among them Credico\u2019s birtherism spiel. The website also had a section for people to donate money by making monthly contributions. \n\nAbout a month prior, Roger Stone was interviewed by POLITICO, where he mused about the possibility of a social media-heavy Trump campaign^[[9](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/02/stone-donalds-cash-a-trump-card-050175)], and pointed out Trump was sitting on $2 billion in cash. \n\nUltimately they were not found guilty of wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, Deutsch Bank began laundering money between the fall of 2011 and spring 2015.\n\nWith the help of American Tim Wiswell, then head of equities for Deutsche Bank in Moscow, and a fellow equity trader Dina Maksutova, Russian broker Igor Volkov was able to move about ten billion dollars out of Russia, some of which diverted through mirror trades belonging to Igor Putin, a cousin of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg. The Rotenberg brothers own Russia\u2019s largest construction company, S.G.M., and are old friends of Vladimir Putin. They are on the U.S. government\u2019s list of sanctioned Russians, which was compiled in response to Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.^[[10](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/deutsche-banks-10-billion-scandal)]\n\n\n1 - - [*Trump touts soft markets in cities like Toronto*](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/trump-touts-soft-markets-in-cities-like-toronto/article17993211/) - 2007\n\n2 - [Trump Sees Act of God in Recession](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/business/05norris.html) - 2008\n\n3 - [Trump Foot Soldier Sidelined Under Glare of Russia Inquiry](https://nytimes.com/2017/07/02/us/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump.html)\n\n 4 - [MICHAEL COHEN NAMED COO OF AFFLICTION](http://sherdog.com/news/pressreleases/Michael-Cohen-Named-COO-of-Affliction-13158)\n\n5 -  [\u0415\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443](https://gazeta.ru/sport/2012/08/kz_4722597.shtml)\n\n6  - [Michael Cohen says Americans paid cash for NY properties to get tax breaks](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article181133596.html)\n\n7 - [MUR: 6462](http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/13044334657.pdf)\n\n8 - [Romney was right about Russia](https://wwwcnn.com/2017/07/31/opinions/obama-romney-russia-opinion-drucker/index.html) - 2017\n\n9 - [Stone: Donald's cash a trump card](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/02/stone-donalds-cash-a-trump-card-050175) - 2011\n\n10 - [Deutsche Bank\u2019s $10-Billion Scandal](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/deutsche-banks-10-billion-scandal) - 2016",

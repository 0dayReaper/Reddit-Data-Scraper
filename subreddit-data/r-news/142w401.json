This, too, ignores the role of slavery in the history of the police. In 1829, a Black abolitionist in Boston named David Walker published \u201c[An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World](https://www.amazon.com/Walkers-Appeal-Four-Articles-Particular/dp/0807869473?ots=1&amp;slotNum=2&amp;imprToken=0ac44af0-150d-1ee2-7ad&amp;tag=thneyo0f-20&amp;linkCode=w50),\u201d calling for violent rebellion: \u201cOne good black man can put to death six white men.\u201d Walker was found dead within the year, and Boston thereafter had a series of mob attacks against abolitionists, including an attempt to lynch William Lloyd Garrison, the publisher of *The Liberator*, in 1835. Walker\u2019s words terrified Southern slaveowners. The governor of North Carolina wrote to his state\u2019s senators, \u201cI beg you will lay this matter before the police of your town and invite their prompt attention to the necessity of arresting the circulation of the book.\u201d By \u201cpolice,\u201d he meant slave patrols: in response to Walker\u2019s \u201cAppeal,\u201d North Carolina formed a statewide \u201cpatrol committee.\u201d",

However The quote you chose has flawed reasoning.\n\nA racist governor in South Carolina made a slavery patrol committee in an unnamed year in South Carolina therefor the Boston Police exists because of slavery.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t explain at all why Boston did it\u2026 just that someone else did a thing at the somewhat the same time.\n\nHere\u2019s a better quote you could use to argue. It\u2019s still lacks direct evidence but the connection is clear.\n\n\u201c It is often said that Britain created the police, and the United States copied it. One could argue that the reverse is true. Colquhoun spent his teens and early twenties in Colonial Virginia, had served as an agent for British cotton manufacturers, and owned shares in sugar plantations in Jamaica. He knew all about slave codes and slave patrols.\u201d",

It goes without saying that law enforcement all has checkered, to downright evil roots. Failing to acknowledge that, or promoting blind support for cops, flies in the face of that.

We\u2019ve had rioting, looting, property damage etc in the city during these protests. The police need training in order to deal with these situations without using excessive force. Not to mention that this \u201ccop city\u201d is largely going to be a fire department training center, which they\u2019ve been having to use run down facilities for decades to train in.",

The protests were triggered BY police violence and any looting is a consequence of poverty. Public funds should go towards improving conditions for those in need, not further empowerment of the state to commit violence (like they already murdered someone and lied to cover it up).\n\nThis is the argument the vast majority of Georgia residents who care about cop city use. It\u2019s beyond me why anyone would argue against the popular opinion of those who will actually be impacted by the project.\n\nI was at some of those protests. Police did not discriminate between who may have been committing crimes and who were there peacefully. We were all rushed, beaten, shot at with rubber bullets, pepper balls, and tear gas.",

Granted, I was not at any protests, however my husband is a first responder and he was concerned for his safety as well as other innocent people when these peaceful protests turned into dangerous riots. If it\u2019s a question of resource allocations, I can think of quite a few areas where they could cut back funding before public safety.",

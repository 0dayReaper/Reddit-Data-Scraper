It doesn't help that whenever something truly bad happens, the US sweeps things under the rug. Like when  [US troops drove over and killed two 14-year-old Korean girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangju_highway_incident). The US decided to \"handle the matter internally,\" and, after a court martial, found the soldiers not guilty. No real punishment, no real justice, two heartbroken families who had to lay their daughters to rest.\n\nOr when a drunk US soldier [beat the shit out of an elderly taxicab driver](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2023/06/113_341135.html). Which happened because the American soldier's card got declined. They went to an ATM to get money, but then the soldier, disgruntled that a Korean man would rightfully request payment, beat the shit out of him.\n\nObviously not all US soldiers in Japan and Korea are like this. But enough of them are that it's a problem. The absolute sense of entitlement these asshats have in Korea is absurd. They treat it like a playground, rather than respect the proud, successful, continuous millennia-old-cultures they find themselves in. It's disgraceful.",

The U.S. military had been in charge of the investigation, and the man had been arrested and charged with driving the car.

There's plenty of valid criticisms to make, we have plenty of problems.

First, there is the step of whether or not the prosecution will prosecute the case after the arrest.  \nThe prosecution rate in Japan is less than 50%. Even if you are arrested, if there is no solid evidence, you will not even be prosecuted. Also, the 99% conviction rate is the same in Canada as well as Japan.  \nRather, the low conviction rate in the U.S. is proof that they prosecute and try innocent people without evidence.",

What people care about is *violent* crime rate, something woefully missing). Definitely not how [Okinawans interpret American occupation](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/18/national/social-issues/okinawa-women-military-violence/#:~:text=28%2C%201949%2C%20entitled%2C%20%E2%80%9C,murders%2C%2018%20rape%20cases%2C%2016).\n\nAlso, the larger issue is that service members don\u2019t go through Okinawan courts, they go through military courts and often don\u2019t face the punishment actually due for the crime. Even if Okinawans commit more crime, \nthey also have a higher relative proportion of criminals arrested and brought to justice, so it would still seem that service members wantonly break the law and go unpunished for it.\n\nEdit: To the people who want to do military-apologia, just read [this first](https://theintercept.com/2021/10/03/okinawa-sexual-crimes-us-military/).",

Their entire history is covering up local crimes where possible, and damage control where required. Hell, crimes ***internal*** to the military are covered up en masse, so of course external crimes are obfuscated to the best of their abilities. An *Appeal To Ignorance* definitely isn\u2019t the rhetorical route to go down here, especially not when we know how prolific the covering of crimes is within US military courts. Oh, but also, [yes here\u2019s proof from Okinawans](https://theintercept.com/2021/10/03/okinawa-sexual-crimes-us-military/).\n\nAlso lol at posting the single most biased source you can (that doesn\u2019t link to the actual stats it lists out, so you can\u2019t actually verify their claims) and then saying \u201cNow disprove this claim.\u201d That\u2019s not how it works, friend. If you make the claim, you need to substantiate it. All you\u2019ve done is link an article that randomly states 2 numbers, intentionally removing all context (again, crime and ***violent*** crime are drastically different - I of course expect more Okinawans to be stealing bread than service members on foreign soil). I\u2019d love to see what the actual break down of crimes is, within each class of crime, between Okinawans and service members.",

In addition, rooms with closed circuit television (CCTV) coverage were provided to accommodate the increased level of interest. Moreover, families of the victims were invited to attend and, to protect their privacy, were offered the use of a separate CCTV-equipped room staffed with an interpreter and military lawyer to explain the processes involved\n\nThe outcome of the court martial is unfair to the families, but it also sounds like the driver's view was obstructed by the vehicle so he could not see the kids and even in the US we don't send people to jail for accidents.\n\nKoreans are perfectly justified being very angry about this and there's no doubt a lot of other incidents, but that specifically is a bad example to demonstrate US soldiers abusing their privilege.",

There isn't (wasn't) a military-only set of roads, and in the Yangju case trailering the vehicles wouldn't have necessarily been possible (narrow, curvy rural roads).  Not like driving damn-near-two-lane-wide vehicles on a narrow road was smart in the first place, but it'd be just as wide and a quarter as maneuverable on a trailer.\n\nThe solution they went with sounds like trailering, though, *after* they went through a large project widening, flattening, and straightening roads they used (and added actual footpaths).  Supposedly retrofitted mirrors and \"retrofitting of additional intercom systems on U.S. military vehicles to allow for direct communication between drivers and vehicle commanders\" but I call bullshit on that because tracks and APCs have had crew comms (station-to-station) well before that which were hard-wired together.\n\nI will absolutely put at least something on the crew.  Sounds like the track commander was turned-out, but they didn't properly maintain their crew communication system *and/or* didn't confirm it worked before stepping off.  Driver should have been turned-out too, for maximum visibility in such tight maneuvering situations.",

I'm saying that because there's a conflict waiting to kick-off again, there are active training sessions with actual weapons platforms all the time in South Korea conducted by both the U.S. and the R.O.K. militaries. There are Korean tanks on Korean streets too. They've been training with that conflict in mind for 50+ years, tanks on the street aren't some unique American jingoist expression.",

US soldiers have for decades behaved like shit in these countries, yet for this sub it is only a few \"bad apples\".\n\nCompare this of how the sub talks about us policemen (a job many us soldiers enter after they leave the military) in a completely different tone. This sub hates police, so much the users project it to any police force around the world, even if other nations don't share the hostility towards their own police. And no matter the danger us police face due to an increasingly agitated, mentally ill and armed population, they are always in the wrong (which tbf they seem to be a lot of times). \n\nIf, say Chinese or Indian troops, would behave like this in their respective host country, this sub wouldn't stop talking about how it is part of their shit culture and indicative of the poor behavior of the whole population. Yet for us soldiers this logic isn't applied. The US armed forces are still very much holy in this sub it seems.",

I made the mistake of befriending a mom and pop bookstore couple, they were very sweet and welcoming, but once I told them I was stationed there, their entire demeanor changed. Can't say I blame them. I worked with the MAs on base, doing reports and stuff along with doing ASF with the Marines and it was just...bad. Lots of DV, drunk and disorderly, random fights for the dumbest reasons,  some Kitty Hawk dudes vandalized a shrine, DUIs, etc. Lots of servicemen and women forget the basic rule: You're a guest in a foreign country and a quite literally a representative of the USA, you have to be on your best behavior and be respectful of the host country and its people.\n\nThat's too much for some people, I guess.",

Had it happened in Kentucky, absolutely not. The types of crimes that result in dishonorable discharges are more along the lines of murder, rape, mutiny, treason, desertion, espionage, serious fraud etc. Dishonorable discharges can only be handed down by a military judge after conviction at court-martial. That's a time consuming pain in the ass for everybody involved, and can backfire if somebody screwed up and didn't dot all the I's and cross all the T's. Commands generally prefer to administratively separate somebody with other than honorable unless it was really bad, or people higher up on the food chain got angry or embarrassed.\n\n\nEven if the case goes to court-martial, and a conviction is obtained, there's no guarantee the judge will issue a Dishonorable discharge. There's other bad discharges besides that one, and like civilian judges, they'll consider a range of factors before deciding whether or not to award the steak dinner. Military Judges are hesitant to do it at times, because it's the equivalent of a felony conviction, and can carry life long consequences such as disenfranchisement.",

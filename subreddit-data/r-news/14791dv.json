It took a lot of time and effort to breed horses with such fragile bone, imbalanced bone structure that they can't support their own weight. Some horses have broken legs just walking in a pasture. It's sickening. People did this intentionally. That's what really bothers me. It was a deliberate process over an extended period of time. The horses are bred for a competitive edge. Some horses break their legs and die young, but that's acceptable collateral damage. I shouldn't be surprised by that considering how many young horses never get a chance to break a leg because they're auctioned off and slaughtered instead.  A friend of mine has been rescuing horses longer than I've been alive. She focuses on young racehorses that are rejected and auctioned off. I don't know how she handles it emotionally. She chooses 1 or 2 horses to save while she's fully aware of the likely outcome for the others.  I have a lot of rescue animals of my own, including 3 Belgian draft horses. I know what happens to most draft horses when they're no longer useful in Amish communities. My three aren't even a drop in the bucket, but at least I don't see the other animals and I don't choose between them. I hate what the Amish do to animals, but racing is worse. Racehorse aren't exploited for food. No one relies on them for nutrition. They aren't used for work. The cruelty and suffering is allowed to go on for a useless sport that could disappear overnight without causing any significant disruption. Most people wouldn't even notice.",

In my rescue's case, the breeder wanted a gray show horse.

But! She had an extensive pedigree going back to invention of her breed (Thoroughbred) from Arabians.\n\nSo sometimes the breeder is breeding hundreds of unwanted horses just to get that ONE genetic trait to show.

He said it\u2019s a big deal in the horse racing industry. He also mentioned that he\u2019s glad he\u2019s no longer working in the industry because horse safety has gone down. \n\nI\u2019m only posting this hoping someone will read my poor answer and give a more detailed explanation.",

He had a much larger than average heart and some believe that this is what powered him to his victories and speed records.

She broke both of the sesamoid bones in her right foreleg. Her jockey tried to pull her up but she kept running further worsening the damage. Vets did what they could but she had to be euthanized. I recall watching that race on TV as a teen and it was pretty upsetting. \n\nOne thing I learned was that her damsire Native Dancer is theorized to be the source of 'soft-boned genetics'. Apparently a lot of these horses are descended from him. I recall hearing several years back that one of his descendants Northern Dancer appeared in the pedigrees of several horses who broke down.",

The fractures and falls are scary and concerning.  I'm sure there's a drug component too but I do think heart attacks and strokes are generally something different entirely.  You can't always predict those and they can happen randomly to horses just like people.  My beloved horse dropped dead in the pasture last year of a suspected massive stroke :( he seemed totally healthy even the day before.",

There will not being loving homes for all of them (there aren\u2019t now) though we don\u2019t slaughter horses in the US anymore for meat, Canada and Mexico do and that\u2019s where the majority would end up. \n\nI\u2019m sure most if not all of the trainers and owners do not want horses to die but they have convinced themselves it\u2019s just part of it. These are not fluke accidents, this has always happened on tracks, the public is just hearing about it more now. \n\nThe other thing is if the racing industry goes under the entire horse community will go with it. It\u2019s happened in areas already where race tracks have shut down. If the major ones close so will many of the feed stores, haulers, rescues, hay farms etc unfortunately they are the financial backbone of the industry in the US",

That didn\u2019t change the fact that you could alter the document before it was sent, but that\u2019s why we have witnesses, notaries, etc for really important stuff. That doesn\u2019t make things hard to forge, but it does make it easier to prove a challenge on a forgery.  \nE-signatures are thoroughly superior to ink when they work. But I think forgeries can be harder to challenge on more important docs. The \u201cnotary\u201d is just an app that accepts your computer logon, which is easier to crack (or social engineer\u2026) than forging the IDs that would convince a physical notary you\u2019re someone else.  \nSo my conclusion is that the 99% of stuff you\u2019re asked to fax that just has your signature with no witness should be switched to the objectively superior e-signature method. And the tiny amount of super important stuff (marriage licenses, house deeds, etc) is up for debate.",

It's the same as when you see a company get fined for doing some shady/illegal financial stuff. If a company makes $1 billion dollars doing something and then they get fined a \"hefty\" sum of $20 million because of some illegal thing they did along the way, then there is basically no reason for them to not keep doing it. At that point it's no different than a mechanic shop buying tools or a store paying for air conditioning. It's just a business expense.",

                    "comment": "While horse racing deaths are not unusual, the scale and scope of recent deaths is particularly concerning.\n\nFirst, before roughy 2017 or so, the vast majority of horse racing deaths were euthanasias caused by race- or training-related injury. A horse would break a bone or tear a muscle in its leg, and because broken bones are almost impossible to heal (or extremely expensive to heal) with horses, they\u2019re put out of their misery. Now I\u2019m not going to say this is right or wrong, but this was a relatively uncommon activity. Before 2018, horse racing in America averaged between 600-700 deaths a year with around 55,000 new racing foals registered every year (just an aside here: an anti-horse racing group pushes that the number of deaths is over 2,000 but this figure also seems to count retired race horses who aren\u2019t racing anymore. Likewise The Jockey Club claims only around 300 horses die a year, but they only count horses who die at the track).\n\nAlso, most big event days avoided horse deaths. During the triple crown days, it was fairly uncommon for a horse to be killed, and again these were primarily due to injuries.\n\nHowever, deaths in horse racing are ratcheting up considerably. 901 race horses died in 2022 in the US. And unlike in previous years, an increasing number of these deaths were deaths in stalls- not caused by apparent injuries. Also, more deaths are happening at big tracks (although the 12 fatalities at Churchill Downs this year were all injury-related deaths). \n\nSo what is likely the cause? The main culprit is most likely a new series of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs that are difficult to detect (and most regulatory racing organizations have historically been fairly lax in their drug testing). But there are other contributing factors. \n\nFirst, horse racing\u2019s governing bodies have primarily punished trainers whose horses fail drug tests lightly. Many receive proverbial slaps on the wrist. In addition, to my knowledge, no regulatory body investigates horses that die. \nNext, because there is no centralized regulatory body in horse racing, it\u2019s relatively easy for an offending trainer to simply relocate to another district. Finally, it is argued that horse racing as a whole is not proactive enough to combat horse deaths, and that many possible solutions, such as changes to racing surfaces, the incorporation of biometric data, or appointing independent veterinarians to ensure each horse is healthy enough to race, have been ignored by regulatory bodies. \n\nSo while horse racing deaths aren\u2019t necessarily unusual, to see this many deaths in a season- and then seeing it again, is unprecedented.",

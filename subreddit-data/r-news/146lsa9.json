Now he and his ilk coordinate, get together, and now they LOOK like they're a lot more popular than they really are.  \"silent majority\" my ass",

They didn\u2019t want \u201cMexican Parties\u201d. \nAs I viewed it, the hospitality, construction and agricultural industries would have shut down without migrants and undocumented workers. I also noticed a lot of money spent by the LGBTQ + community, yet a lot of animosity even then. \nIn other words, it was the first time I was in the South and got that Civil War era feeling. None of this is new, IMHO.\nSaddest part to me? The amount of money the LGBTQ + community, undocumented/ migrant workers, and Disney have made for this state prior to my visit and since my visit is astounding.

People would walk up and start talking to me and I could always tell. \n\nFlorida is bad. The backwoods of NC are still bad enough you'll get killed for not looking white enough. \n\nKentucky is just an entire racist state that is seemingly stuck in a virtual past where they held power. But overall it seems to be the worst when it's sheer percentages of people who are racist. I moved to California. I thought the politics would be annoying.  Not really, it's nice to not care and have others not care. The friendships in this area are absolutely more diverse and understanding.

Before Nazis were in power being gay was already criminalised but police could rarely convict and only kept lists of people spotted in gay bars. Nazis used that old list to arrest and put people into camps along with Jewish citizens",

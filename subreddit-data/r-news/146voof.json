            "comment": "I'm sick of saying it because it's an uncomfortable truth, but if people really cared about dogs, they'd stop breeding pit bulls. They are by and large the most commonly sheltered, least adopted and most frequently euthanized dogs in the country. Their behaviors make them a danger to humans, which makes it a danger to themselves. They get shot by police, killed by neighbors, get in vicious fights with other dogs and are put down in shelters all across the country. No dog breed is required by anybody or any ecosystem. We made them. We can stop making them. I'm not and never have advocated for killing them. But really, legislation introduced sooner rather than later restricting their breeding will mean that many less dogs being attacked or killed in the future, much less attacking or killing us. More and more people are becoming aware of the danger they possess, which means less and less pit bulls are finding suitable owners and are instead adopted by people already seeking aggressive dogs.   \n\n\nNot breeding them is not the same as killing them. It is not inherently cruel. It is a cruelty that we continue to ignore the statistical evidence when it comes to policy making and instead let dogs with temperaments we as humans fostered suffer the often fatal consequences of acting on them.",

I am a practicing veterinarian, and as my senior case study I focused on how inhumane it is to continue breeding brachycephalic animals. It focused on a specific French bulldog case study with so many horrible problems including heart disease, hind limb paralysis, and chronic UTIs. The owners could not let her go (despite veterinary advocation for euthanasia). In summary my opinion is that we give an unnatural breed a boost in evolutionary fitness simply because we think it is cute. And that\u2019s so fucked up. These dogs come in to the ER daily because they can\u2019t breathe, they have deformed vertebrae that predispose them to hindlimb paresis/paralysis, many of them cannot give natural birth and require c-sections because of their narrow birth canal, neonatal cleft palate, heart failure, aspiration pneumonia literally any fucking time they vomit, tracheal collapse, elongated soft palate, keratitis, dental malocclusion predisposing to dental disease and tooth root abscesses, luxating patellas, hip disease, seizures\u2026.   But hey, guess who is the most popular dog breed last year per the American Kennel club.",

I find it more cruel and a waste of resources and money to just keep an unadoptable dog alive in a tiny kennel for *years* due to its high aggression instead of just humanely putting them down for BE.\n\nSo many of these 'NO dogs, NO children, NO SMALL ANIMALS' dogs that i see flooding my local shelters and being peddled as 'decent and docile dogs' should of all been BE'd as soon as they bit and/or killed another dog due to aggression.",

To some degree, having known a lot of shelter volunteers I think a good lot of them are just genuinely bad at ID'ing breeds (like no shame but because it's mostly volunteer based we don't exactly always collect the brightest people). An example, the rescue I worked with for years recently labeled an obviously purebred husky as a \"German Shepard\".  But the other times, I do think it's beyond willful ignorance and into straight up negligence.  I think if you press them on it, I think they *want* the dog to be another breed, they hope and focus on any attributes that aren't pittie (does the pit mix have lab in it? Probably, but it's still clearly mostly Pittie, they didn't want to lead with that though on adoption sites).  I've railed against it for years, they are aware of the fact that owners are less likely to adopt bully breeds and I'm sure they factors in even though they'll never admit it.  It pissed me off to no end.\n\nEdit to add, occasionally it is legitimately difficult. Like the group I worked with in Louisiana has both a ton of Catahoulas and a lot of bully breeds in their shelters, and sometimes I've gotten breed IDs wrong between the two.  That and puppies are notoriously difficult to ID under a certain age.  But again, I've too often seen clearly bully breed dogs mislabeled and it's absolutely a problem that more groups should be held accountable for.",

So along comes next family, sees pit bull, says, oh what a cute velvet hippo and rescue an animal they know nothing about, which may main or kill someone. Anyway, this is the world we live in, where an oops, 'I'm sorry my dog killed your grandmother!' results in a fine of $100, or some such. Sigh.",

I'd like to think it's a appropriate tactic, but no way, sorry. Not for your average size and strength human. These dogs are way too strong and the sternum is embedded in thick muscle, strong ligaments... Just not feasible. \n\nHowever, grabbing a leg or two and pulling, twisting etc might actually work. Tendons are pretty fragile and you can injure joints fairly easily. Not sure if that would stop a rabid pit dog mid attack tho. \n\nThey're a menace.",

Nueter them all, and let them die out natural deaths. \n\nThat way you reduce the amount of them that live most of their lives in shelters. You reduce dog attacks and you take away a breed that can and does cause a lot of damage",

Since maybe 2020 or so, the narrative has seemingly shifted from \u201cblame the owner not the dog\u201d to being *heavily* against pitbulls as a breed. I won\u2019t risk the mob by inserting my opinion, but I\u2019ve browsed the majority of posts like this for the last two years and the comments are pretty much completely dominated by the anti-pitbull side.",

A block from my house, I heard some barking and yelling coming from across the street as a pair of people were exiting (I assume) their house with a dog. That they hadn't leashed first. I tried keeping calm, even when the dog noticed me and ran across the street. Pit bull. No biggie, I'll just offer my hand for it to sniff, get it to calm down, and be on my way. Nope. Thing was an angry bugger, and its body language made it clear that it wasn't just curious. Okay, so I switch to defensive and get ready to kick it the moment it tries to make for my legs. Back across the street, I heard the owners yell out \"don't hurt him!\". My dumbass listened for some reason. Even when they came over and tried to get between it and me, it still gave them the runaround to try to bite at me. My nerve broke, and I ran. Tried to juke it by running around the trees and cars to give me enough time to climb a car, but no dice. Thing was hot on my heels, and at one point narrowly missed chomping at my face cause I swerved that second. This went on for at least a dozen seconds l, before I hear a yell from one of the cars parked to get in. I manage to break away fast enough to dive into the car. The dog lost sight of me, only for it to race off to one of the neighboring houses as a person was steeping outside, it's owners chasing behind. When I did damage assessment at home, it managed to somehow draw blood from under leather gloves, and leave a scratch on my shin, both leaving scars, despite never having gotten a good bite in. That experience, combined with a bunch more as a delivery driver, made me no longer that much of a dog person.",

Gets booed viciously by the home crowd and even the guy running the lights on the CN tower tells him to fuck himself by displaying rainbow colours while hes going to the mound\n\n4) Blue Jays admit there is no plan to do anything and hes not facing any discipline.  \n\n5) In an absolute baffling and insane move, the team decides he will be the catcher for the first pitch to kick off Pride week.  Not only is this fucking insane, but apparently they decide to use pride week to promote a weeklong redemption of a guy who said gay people were demons\n\n6) GM Ross Atkins doubles down and says nothing will happen\n\n7) Bass comes out about an hour later and doubles down on all his comments saying he didnt do anything wrong.\n\n8) He gets DFA'd\n\nBass, Ross Atkins, Rogers, the team, and whoever is doing PR for them can go fuck themselves.

Gay is also used as a broad term to describe people attracted to someone of the same gender.\n\nB \u2013 Bisexual: A person who is physically and emotionally attracted to people of more than one gender and who identifies as bisexual.\n\nT \u2013 Trans: A term used by people who identify with a gender that is different from the gender they were assigned at birth. People whose gender identity falls outside of the gender binary (the idea that there are only two genders \u2014 male and female) may also call themselves trans. Since trans is a word used to describe identity, a person has to identify with the term (believe it\u2019s the best way to describe themselves) for it to be applicable.\n\nQ \u2013 Queer: A broad term that includes all sexual orientations and gender identities within the LGBTQ2S+ community, including those who don\u2019t identify with any other identity in LGBTQ2S+.\n\nQ \u2013 Questioning: some people may feel unsure about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. They may describe themselves as questioning.\n\n2S \u2013 Two spirit: A person with both a feminine and a masculine spirit living in the same body. It\u2019s an important term within some Indigenous cultures.\n\n**+** \u2013 Plus: There are a number of other terms that people may use to describe their own sexual or gender identity. The plus is intended to represent the entire community, not just those who identify with the terms described above.\n\nIt is excessive IMO, would love to see it get shortened to simply LGBT+, but given the community is all about inclusion I understand the reasons more letters keep getting added.",

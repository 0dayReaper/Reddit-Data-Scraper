I don't think more data would help without a change to how it handles the data when generating responses.  Like here, it apparently generated not only case citations but also excerpts of case text.  That's an easy thing for a computer to cross-check (look up the citation in a validated database and see whether the reference exists and the text matches) but ChatGPT isn't set up to do that.  It seems to treat citations and quotes more or less the same as any other string of text it generates.",

There is plenty of work going on trying to figure out how to get LLMs to hallucinate less frequently. The other day, I saw a paper describing a method for getting an LLM to check whether it is hallucinating or not.\n\nGive it a few years or two we may have some fairly reliable AI chatbot tools that can do these sorts of information retrieval tasks well.",

This was its response:\n\n&gt; As an AI language model, I don't possess personal beliefs or subjective experiences, nor do I have the capability to observe or verify the truth of statements directly. My responses are based on patterns and information derived from the data I was trained on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Determining truth from falsity often relies on several methods, including empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and consensus within a community of experts. Here are a few commonly used approaches:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Empirical evidence: Truth can be ascertained through empirical observations and experimentation. Scientific methods, such as hypothesis testing, data collection, and analysis, aim to provide evidence for or against a particular claim or hypothesis.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Logical reasoning: Truth can be evaluated through deductive and inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning involves deriving specific conclusions from general principles or premises, while inductive reasoning involves drawing general conclusions based on specific observations or patterns.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Consensus: In certain areas, truth is determined by consensus among experts within a particular field. Through rigorous scrutiny, peer review, and replication of studies, experts collectively assess and agree upon what is considered true or valid within their domain of expertise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Falsifiability: Some theories or claims can be considered true if they are falsifiable. This means they can be tested and potentially proven false through empirical evidence. In scientific inquiry, theories that make specific predictions that can be tested and potentially falsified are generally considered more reliable.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's worth noting that determining truth can be a complex and ongoing process, subject to revision as new information, evidence, or perspectives emerge. Different fields of study may have different criteria for establishing truth, and absolute certainty is not always achievable in all domains.\n\nI'm personally not sure how my original example fits into this model of training. Shadows do not have mass. Why would it tell me that they do? It's not going to derive that from subjective opinion, data it was trained on, empircal evidence, or logical reasoning. Definitely beyond my understanding.",

It is based on article informativeness, site quality, tone of bias, and the expertise of the author. 68.8% would be an above average score. It is a very high score for a news service that covers contemporary politics.\n\nFor example, The Factual chrome extension gives the article posted by OP a 70% rating. That calculation is based on the criteria below:\n\n* Associated Press Site quality: High (Good)\n* Larry Neumeister Author expertise: High (Good)\n* Sources quality: Medium (Okay)\n* Tone: Moderately opinionated (Okay)\n* Author topic focus: Politics (Good)\n* Tone: Moderately opinionated (Okay)\n* Diversity of sources: Low (Bad)\n* Meaningful quotes: 14 (Good)\n* Unique links: 3 (Okay)\n* Politically diverse sources: (Not Applicable)\n* Multiple sources reporting: Yes (Good)\n\nA story could be *100%* factual, but if the site has a low reputation, the article does not maintain a tone of neutrality, and the author doesn't have multiple sources to cite, it will receive a very low \"Factual\" grade.",

Since 1972, US forces have been present under a status of forces agreement(SOFA) with the government of Japan, and it's no longer an occupation. The Governor of Okinawa has been Japanese since that time, and the Japanese can kick the Americans out.",

Example in Germany a solider drunk drives, the police would deliver them to the front gate and hand them over to the military police.  I know US/Japan SOFA is different.  \n\nBest he can hope for is to be given back to the US to undergo article 15 punishment, a captain mast is to light, but with the egg on the US face he might face a court martial under article 134 conduct unbecoming.  I've known a few that were stationed there and they said usually the Japanese tells the US to remove said solider from Japan. \n\nedit just looked at it and the Japan is quite a bit different than European one.  Especially after the 1995 rape in Okinawa.  Since then, only a few select crimes under certain circumstance as covered the rest the Japanese get.",

The Corp needs a new culture, the Army did a full reset in the 90s and it was a huge improvement in performance, professionalism, and discipline. I enlisted in 96 and the stories the NCOs had about how out of control things were in the 80s and right up to the post Gulf war recovery were insane. CQs having to carry pistols in the barracks at Fort Bragg, brothels in the barracks, wide spread use of coke and heroin, gun running. My first unit at fort hood had two vietnam vet platoon sergeants and 15 known gang members ( wore their colors to mandatory fun events ). It was so much better by the time I retired in 2018, almost like two different Armies.",

While I think there was a bit of hysteria about the whole thing, the end result was that the USN was a pretty straight-laced organization by the time I got in. Add to that the officer corp getting their word of prayer after Tailhook in the early 1990s. \n\nMy current opinion is that the JSOC guys need to be rebuilt from the ground up at this point, as the whole \"quiet professional\" thing has flown out the window and the whole organization is filled with bros who are completely infatuated with themselves. That's a personal opinion based on observations and collogues that work with the group.",

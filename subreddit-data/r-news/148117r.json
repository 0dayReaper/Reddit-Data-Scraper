In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, one of the major challenges in medicine was to find a test that would conclusively determine whether someone was dead. Many doctors came up with ideas, but none of them were 100% accurate, unless you count the ones where if the patient wasn\u2019t dead before the test, they would be after. Even with modern technology, it still isn\u2019t easy.",

If you have a string going into the coffin that's an access point for animals, like mice. A decomposing body attracts critters who then gain access via the hole and all that movement causes the string to move and the bell to ring. So then you dig them up, expecting to find them alive, and instead find quite the mess. I never bothered to verify but it seemed plausible enough",

A common one is that people in Victorian times were so afraid of being buried while still alive that they had their coffins fitted with a string and a bell so they could attract the attention of a graveyard attendant if they woke up. Though the fear of premature burial was indeed intense and various inventions that included bells were really developed to reassure people, the expression has nothing to do with the matter.\n\nhttps://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-rin1.htm",

This man was embalmed, had organs removed. But still, the man's family insisted the Lord wanted him to live... So they all pray their dicks off and voila! He comes back to life, they put his organs back, and he lives a normal healthy life spreading the word of God.\n\nThis was presented to us as factual accounts of a true event. My classmates ate it up, \"See! There IS proof there's a God!\". But even my still malleable brain thought that was some grade-A bullshit.",

She was only found innocent after her second child also showed similar symptoms despite having no contact with the mother. It turned out that it was a genetic condition that mimics antifreeze poisoning. The craziest thing about that is that even after it was proven the second child had this condition it was still argued that it wasn't related or relevant to her first son's death.",

([story is here; I'm not sure if the site is paywalled.](https://www.wired.com/story/kathleen-folbigg-sudden-infant-death-mystery/))\n\nin short, there was no physical evidence to begin with that Kathleen smothered her children or did anything to kill them. the prosecution relied heavily on diaries where she wrote about her feelings of despair, frustration, etc.\n\none example from the diaries:\n\n&gt;This one was written between June 1997 and April 1998. Reading through it, Ryan stopped on a page dated January 28, 1998. Kathleen had become so angry at Laura, she wrote, that she \u201cnearly purposely dropped her one the floor &amp; left her.\u201d She went on: \u201cI feel like the worst mother on this earth. Scared that she\u2019ll leave me now. Like Sarah did. I knew I was short tempered &amp; cruel sometimes to her &amp; she left. With a bit of help.\u201d\n\ncircumstantial evidence from the diaries led to her conviction.\n\nyears later, after hearing from all the experts about the genetic testing, the judge rejected the findings that cast reasonable doubt on the alleged killings and instead focused on the diaries again:\n\n&gt;Reginald Blanch, the judicial officer presiding over the inquiry, was left with a decision to make. The Sydney team and the Canberra team had submitted conflicting expert opinions. When Blanch delivered his decision in July of 2019, his language was unmistakably subjective. With respect to the CALM2 variant, he wrote, \u201cI prefer the expertise and evidence of Professors Skinner and Kirk and Dr Buckley.\u201d  \nBlanch then returned to the diaries to make his final decision. During the inquiry, Folbigg had been called to testify and was cross-examined by a state-appointed barrister. After reading out excerpts from the diary, he said: \u201cYou did kill them all, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Folbigg sobbed. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t kill my children,\u201d she replied, \u201cand these diaries are a record of just how depressed and how much trouble I was having.\u201d Blanch found Folbigg\u2019s answer \u201csimply unbelievable.\u201d The only reasonable interpretation of the diaries, he concluded, was as \u201cvirtual admissions of guilt.\u201d  \nFolbigg would remain in prison.",

That's a very foolish idea to depend on. There are so many exceptions that no one should ever trust in confidentiality when speaking to medical professionals. I'm afraid that we'll be seeing cases of women convicted of trying to end pregnancies based on nothing but statements to medical professionals. It isn't safe for a woman to see a medical professional in many states if she's thinking about ending a pregnancy. I'm afraid that lots of women won't understand that risk until its too late. It isn't just red states. Blue and purple states aren't any better, its just less likely that court cases concerning abortion will occur outside of red states. There are still plenty of other reasons for supposedly private information to come up in court - or be handed over to probation/parole, police officers, and judges without the patient's knowledge or consent.",

My professional background alone would have led to considering a genetic illness. I've worked with plenty of families that had multiple children affected by the same genetic disorder. Of course, people without that sort of background may not think of such an explanation, but that case should have been analyzed by numerous medical professionals. From what I've read, they had a grand total of two doctors involved throughout the entire trial, and neither of them had any expertise in genetics. Now that I\"m thinking about it, qualified professionals should have been involved with the family before the third and fourth children died. It doesn't seem like anyone cared about those children until it was time for a trial to vilify the mother.",

Further, there's no recorded death ever of a person this young with the same genetic condition.\n\nThe third child had severe epileptic seizures, but only started having them after some incident in the home where he was injured/not breathing.\n\nThe fourth child had no ailments or genetic illnesses.\n\nI think there is probably reasonable doubt to her guilt and don't think I'd convict her, but I do think she more likely than not murdered them. Especially her diary entries. A few excerpts:\n\n\n&gt;Craig was pretty drunk Friday night. In his drunken stupor he admitted that he's not really happy. There's a problem with his security level with me and he has a morbid fear about Laura - he, well I know there's nothing wrong with her. Nothing out of ordinary anyway. Because it was me not them.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Getting Laura to be next year ought to be fun. She'll realise a party is going on. And that will be it. Wonder if the battle of the wills will start with her and I then. We'll actually get to see. **She's a fairly good natured baby, thank goodness, it will save her from the fate of her siblings. I think she was warned.** It can't happen again. I'm ashamed of myself. I can't tell Craig about it because he'll worry about leaving her with me. **When I think I'm going to lose control, like last times, I'll just hand baby over to someone else. That will be the day to lock me up and throw away the key. Something I'm sure will happen one day.**\n\n...\n\n&gt;Another year gone and what a year to come. I have a baby on the way, which means major personal sacrifice for both of us. But I feel confident about it all going well this time. I am going to call for help this time and not attempt to do everything myself anymore. I know that was the main reason for all my stress before and stress made me do terrible things.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Hopefully preparing myself will mean the end of my dark moods, or at least the ability to see it coming and say to him or someone: \"Hey, help, I'm getting overwhelmed here. Help me out.\" That will be the key to this baby's survival. It surely will. But, enough dwelling, things are different this time. It will all work out for sure.\n\n...\n\n&gt;I think Laura is beautiful compared to Sarah - she was cute but Laura has a special look about her. Her slight difference in looks gives her a beautiful face. Not just pretty, cute and cuddly, gorgeous and beautiful. Well so far anyway. Looking at the video, Sarah was boyish looking. Laura has definite feminine features. They are chalk and cheese. And truthfully just as well. **Wouldn't of handled another one like Sarah. She saved her life by being different.**\n\n...\n\n&gt;Must try to release my stress somehow. I'm starting to take it out on her. Bad move. **Bad things and thoughts happen when that happens. It will never happen again.**\n\n..\n\n&gt;Getting Laura to be next year ought to be fun. She'll realise a party is going on. And that will be it. Wonder if the battle of the wills will start with her and I then. We'll actually get to see. **She's a fairly good natured baby, thank goodness, it will save her from the fate of her siblings. I think she was warned.**\n\n..\n\n&gt;I feel like the worst mother on this earth. Scared that she'll leave me now. Like Sarah did. **I knew I was short tempered and cruel sometimes to her and she left. With a bit of help.** I don't want that to ever happen again. I actually seem to have a bond with Laura. It can't happen again. I'm ashamed of myself. I can't tell Craig about it because he'll worry about leaving her with me. Only seems to happen if I'm too tired. Her moaning, bored, whingy sound drives me up the wall. I truly can't wait until she's old enough to tell me what she wants.\n\n..\n\n&gt;scary feelings, I've realised I actually love her &amp; have bonded with her . . . maternal instinct, is what they call it. I know now I never had it with the others. **Monitor is a good idea. Nothing can happen without the monitor knowing &amp; since I'm not game enough not to plug it in, because theyde want to know why I hadn't, everything will be fine this time**",

Other CALM mutations have led to deaths of children and calmodulinopathy is correlated with SIDS and CALM mutations may cause up to 10% of unexplained infant deaths. We know that calmodulinopathy is highly lethal. Deaths in toddlers have been conclusive linked to other CALM2 variants. The fact that this specific mutation is newly discovered is not great evidence that it can't cause death when almost identical mutations have been found to cause very young deaths and the pathology has been established.\n\nLeading experts who are not just geneticists but specialised in the CALM genes believe the defect found in the Folbigg girls would be highly lethal and that a otherwise minor infection could have triggered a cardiac arrest. Personally I think that two children with a highly lethal genetic defect that leads to 30% of individuals with it suffering at least one cardiac arrest is more than likely. The probability of them never suffering a cardiac event is lower than them dying of it.\n\nI agree further research into the gene in the boys needs further research before it can be definitely associated with lethal epilepsy.",

There's also never been a case of an infant with the daughter's genetic disorder dying, so it's really a 'this possibly maybe could have caused the daughters' deaths.' \n\n&gt;The two boys had a mutation that was very likely to lead to severe epileptic seizures\n\nNothing in your linked article talks about the boys. That disorder is also only linked to early onset epilepsy **in mice**.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56355695\n\n&gt;A different genetic mutation has been discovered in the two boys, Caleb and Patrick, although the scientists acknowledge that here, further research is needed.\n\n&gt;The scientists also reported that Caleb and Patrick each carried two rare variants in BSN, **a gene shown to cause early onset lethal epilepsy in mice.**\n\nNo reported cases of it happening in a human ever.\n\n&gt;Craig was awakened by the sounds of his wife screaming and found her standing at the baby's cot. He noticed the child was not breathing and attempted to revive him by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An ambulance was called and Patrick was taken to hospital. He would later be diagnosed to be suffering from epilepsy and cortical blindness, though the apparent life-threatening event would go unexplained. \n\nSo what happened here?\n\n&gt; If you had that many children die suddenly, and without explaination, wouldn't you blame yourself? Wouldnt you try to rationalize the deaths, pouring over every one of your actions as a mother?\n\nI understand that. To me it's the died with \"a little bit of help\", one daughter being easier \"saved her life\" and \"she was warned\" and especially that excerpt about the baby monitor. Why would you write that everything will be OK because you are not \"game enough\" to unplug the baby monitor unless you were doing something you weren't supposed to? \n\nAgain, I think there is probably reasonable doubt.",

Especially how one daughter died \"With a bit of help,\" one daughter being a good baby would \"save her from the fate of her siblings\" and \"saved her life by being different\", and the entry about the baby monitor. Why would you write that you're not 'game enough' to not plug in the baby monitor \"because they'd want to know why I hadn't.\"? What do you personally think that is referring to? \n\nI would understand it being portrayed as grief much more if there were less specific references to her doing something to harm her kids. \"It was all my fault\" \"I'm a terrible mother\" etc. would make sense for a parent who's lost kids. \"Better keep the baby monitor plugged in because if I don't then they'll wonder why I unplugged it  and I don't have the balls to do that so everything will be fine this time\" = extremely suspicious to me. \n\n&gt; 100 scientists are wrong\n\nThat's only for the two daughters who had the genetic defect that **possibly maybe could have ** resulted in their deaths, nothing about the other two kids. And also, I can find 100 scientists who say climate change isn't real lol. Would you believe them?",

From the show I watched it definitely sounded like she was innocent.  Glad to see her ~~acquitted~~ pardoned.\n\nEdit- switched acquitted to pardoned, and I also found the episode I was talking about in my watch history but I can\u2019t link it.  It\u2019s called \u201cwoman accused of killing her 4 children has been released from prison\u201d. \n\nEdit 2- now that Reddit isn\u2019t being weird I\u2019m going to try to post the link again.  https://youtu.be/NdJCFqZITSQ",

Nobody should be getting convicted of anything with a sentence longer than a year without completely incontrovertible evidence from multiple sources.  \n\nIf you don't have physical evidence that they committed the crime like DNA or a murder weapon, AND multiple lines of hard evidence like photos, videos, and other sensor/electronic data of them actively committing the crime, AND evidence of their mental state being one compatible with committing the crime (e.g. saying \"I'm going to stab the victim\" before stabbing said victim), AND *multiple* witnesses/victims with stories with *absolutely no disagreement between them whatsoever*, then the prosecutor shouldn't have a case.  This also includes if they confessed; a confession alone isn't sufficient evidence.\n\nIf you've got all that evidence such that it's practically impossible on a physical, scientific level that they *didn't* commit the crime, *and* the crime is serious enough to warrant the death penalty, then I personally have very little problem with the Anders Breiviks of the world being humanely euthanized (not lethal injection, something that's actually painless like a nitrogen chamber) by the state.",

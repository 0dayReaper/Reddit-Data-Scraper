Then calls and tells his mother and sister she's going to have her brother and his friends come fuck him up and kill him. \n\nHer brother texts back \"he's a dead man walking.\" Brother and three friends come with at least two alleged, and one confirmed illegally carried firearm later tossed in the bushes and lied about, the police admitted they did not search the car's path as it fled the scene, (including driving by hospitals where they could have gotten medical attention) for any other firearms even after finding out they'd been lied to about the group being armed.\n\nDespite this the prosecutors allege these armed men were there just to \"talk\" even though their credibility is horrendous from statements they made vs the facts, and that they assaulted first his younger brother, and then him. He then went into his house, got his gun, came out and pursued them to their car where he alleges they pointed guns at him. \n\nThis boils down to did they point guns at him or not, and he's much more credible than they are given the circumstances of the encounter.",

I think this case was purely the police reaching a conclusion very early on and looking to prove the case from there. Once that happened all the new information and unreliability of the old information was merely evidence that needed to be overcome rather then a reason to go back and reassess their initial opinion. \n\nI don't think their initial conclusion in the case was incorrectly reached. The problem was that they didn't reassess their conclusion.",

Next his gun being an ar-15 is something that is somehow much more threatening than a Taurus 9mm even though I can tell you shitty cheap hand guns murder hundreds of times more people. The ar-15 also makes this a quasi political issue where these guns are used way too often in targeted mass shootings, there are movements to restrict them, and there's a \"message\" to be sent that we won't let you run around with a \"military rifle\" and claim self defense.\n\nAnd yes he is black, and I do think that had an impact especially on that initial conclusion police reached. The police see a black man and see a perp, even if they aren't making any conscious effort to be racist you associate and develop patterns in your mind. Someone who looks like a disproportionate percentage of people you arrest isn't getting your benefit of the doubt. Minority, impoverished communities have the most policing, some would say over policing and over time without active training these biases build. \n\nI also think there's an aspect to this of him being a man accused of domestic violence. When you think about that the initial response is to a.) Believe the victim, and b.) People who commit domestic violence are many times more likely to commit other violent crimes.  It's easy to jump ahead a step and well he beats his girlfriend, he's the kind of person to shoot someone who isn't posing a threat. \n\nThis case was always weak, it died and was buried the second his ex's cross began, and was re-exhumed killed and buried again when the lead detective giggled about her and the investigations blunders on the stand. \n\n\"So like just cause one of them never said he had a gun in his first interview with a detective, doesn't mean like we knew he was lying to us when we proved he had a gun with him. It was like a super traumatic experience and people forget they bring guns to go jump people, and there's no, like, way like, we know for like 100% certain that anybody else in that car knew he had a gun, it wasn't like they were all super close talking to each other, or like had a bunch of social media posts flashing guns, texted about shooting somebody, that topic wouldn't come up on a half hour car ride, why would they like, you know lie about bringing guns. I mean it wasn't even worth investigating, gotta save the taxpayer dollars Lol \ud83d\ude02\"",

There is a car, it has been shot up, and one person is dead. They say they have no guns, they do not appear to have guns on them. The bullets are to the side of the car, the car was not shot consistent with being used as a weapon, and there are a significant number of them. My understanding is Travis Rudolph invoked some of his rights and so was less cooperative which may have limited what information they received from him at the time. \n\nThat is not the facts of a self defence case. That is a slam dunk murder/attempted murder case. Assuming they knew of the fight the case is very simple for them. A fight broke out, one person went to get a gun, the others fled to their car, the person who got their gun fired at them. So until the handgun is found, and the person admitted that he had lied, a self defence claim would sound crazy even assuming it had been made at that point. \n\nThe problem wasn't their initial conclusion that it was not a self defence shooting. The problem was that once they had decided it wasn't self defence all they cared about was proving it. They did not reassess their conclusion when some rather fundamental aspects of that conclusion were no longer correct. The other party being armed at the time completely changes everything.",

Then others come in, read the thread's top voted comment chains, and walk away thinking they know more about the subject without ever actually bothering to read any articles or official government press releases to confirm their \"new knowledge.\"",

There isn't just one answer. But here are mine (please note, the weighting is not equal; it's just a list):\n\n- Climate change (transportation of oil): Bad. Now that oil will continue to be trucked and trained over. More GHG emissions. Keystone had proposals in approval (whether you believe them or not) to make this addition carbon neutral (obviously the oil flowing through it wouldn't be). \n- Environment (transportation of oil): Good. Less chance of oil spill in sensitive ecosystems. Though train spills are still a thing and go through similar ecosystems.\n- \u20ac Economy: Bad in the short term. Good in the long term. The government has already spent billions betting on this pipeline (which was stupid imo since Obama cancelled it too). That money ain't coming back and neither are the thousands and thousands of jobs it would have brought. There was a lawsuit filed against the US gov't for $15B back in '15. I imagine the next lawsuit will be even higher. But this will be another example to the people of Alberta that diversification is now a means of survival and hopefully think twice about oil projects.\n- Investments: Mixed. It's great for my Enbridge investments since now they get to maintain their hold on the pipeline market. TC Energy though, they took a hit after Biden's announcement but overall this should have been priced in.\n- Politics: Good. You get to pretend you care about the environment by cancelling the most efficient transport method all the while promoting American fracking.\n- $ Indigenous: Mixed? I really can't say. My research indicates some are for, some are against. I want to borderline good.\n- $ Land rights: Goodish. There were multiple eminent domain lawsuits in place due to land owners not wanting to sell. Those will obviously be lost, but some made a pretty penny for effectively worthless land they owned. \n- $ Cost: Bad. This pipeline would improve oil flow and to different regions, meaning cheaper oil and a lower minimum feasible barrel cost to maintain oil sands production.\n- $ Renewables: Good. Not like renewables needed much more push to be adopted, but the implied oil price savings of this pipeline could have deferred renewables adoption even longer. Though oil has been funding the research and development of SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) in Alberta... Which the supposedly green-friendly federal Liberal government just delayed their own funding on in support of hydrogen tech (news flash: where do you think we get the hydrogen? [Nonrenewables!](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-resources))\n\nPersonally, I do not support the oil sands but i do feel for Alberta and ultimately wished this project wouldve worked out. Not just because it's one of the dirtiest oils made, the Alberta government has absolutely fucked up what could have been a massive cash cow for the province and Canada as a whole. Norway modeled their sovereign fund off of Alberta's early fund. As we all know Norway's is worth [over $1 trillion USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway) while Canada's is worth a measly [$12 billion USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Heritage_Savings_Trust_Fund) due to severe mismanagement of the whole oil program and greedy hands. That money could have been used (and to be fair, it has... Just not as much as it should) to keep the economy diversified and fund contingency plans for when oil extraction becomes unfeasible. Now the province is strongly pro-oil purely out of necessity; they have little else.\n\nEdit: \n\n**$ indicates a point I've added after-the-fact and \u20ac indicates a point I've edited. thanks to your feedback. Remember, the theme is: \"say 'fuck you' to echo chambers!\"**",

Of course we don't have the competing capacity in alternatives today.. but seeing higher fossil fuel costs tends to result in more funds available to get those alternatives off the ground and/or more competitive on price due to increased scale.\n\nFossil fuels have a lock on some things for a while.. but a big bite can be taken out of them in various areas (trucking, cars, electricity generation,.. I don't know what else)\n\nEdit: Maybe an increasing carbon tax (and perhaps reduced fossil fuel industry subsidies) along with the pipeline would have made more sense (and that's Canada's/Trudeau's approach).. but politically, it might result in people burning the US down.. and so I'm cynically glad they're not doing what might seem to be the most objectively prudent thing (humans notwithstanding).",

There's even a remarkably similar case in *Metalclad*'s claim against Mexico:\n\n&gt; In  Metalclad, a California-based  hazardous  waste  disposal  corporation\u2019s  facility  in  the  Mexican State  of  San  Luis  Potosi  was  effectively  shuttered  by  municipal  and  state  government  actions.  By  refusing  to  grant  operational  permits  to  the  company  based   on   environmental   justifications,   Mexico   was   held   to   have   treated   Metalclad inequitably, amounting to indirect expropriation.\n\n&gt; In  its  finding,  the  tribunal  noted  that  as  a  foreign  investor,  Metalclad  had  appropriately  relied  on  the  information  provided  to  it  by  the  Mexican  federal  government,  which  stated  that  the  municipal  construction  permits  in  question  were  not  required.  As  such,  as  a  NAFTA  signatory,  Mexico  failed  to  live  up  to  its  treaty  obligations,  namely  the  provision  of  a  transparent  and  predictable  framework for the planning and investment of an investor from a NAFTA party. In the absence of this framework, and due to the clear and intentional prohibition of use of the landfill facility, the actions by the local authorities in question were ruled tantamount to indirect expropriation. The panel found that a Mexican state governor had used a series of bad faith environmental measures in order to block the  opening  of  a  foreign  investor\u2019s  site,  despite  otherwise  being  compliant  with  all applicable legal standards. Of the $90 million in damages Metalclad had filed suit for, the arbitration panel awarded $16.7 million.",

But most pipelines in America run to Cushing, OK, it\u2019s one of the largest, if not the largest hub here. From there most lines go to the Gulf of Mexico, and some branch over to the Atlantic. There\u2019s few major supply pipelines that head west, most run south and East. But trains are everywhere and plenty run out west. Warren Buffett owns BNSF railways and they will transport plenty of oil out west. He\u2019s anti-pipeline and people praise him for it but it\u2019s just because he wants it on his trains",

Sure maybe it\u2019s cheaper, but it isn\u2019t better for the environment. \n\nGood thing the US only imports a small fraction of it's oil consumption from OPEC (like 10-12%). We typically produce 60% of our own, then import most from Canada and Mexico (in that order). If all of OPEC stopped selling to us tomorrow prices would go up, but it would hurt less than Katrina did.\n\nIf Canada stopped selling to us though, that's where the real pain would kick in.",

Was a real good guy, an immigrant from Serbia (actually refugee in a sense) - but leaned right pretty hard.  I never really got into it about fossil fuels since it was his livlihood, but we talked a few times about climate change, which he did understand was a looming issue.\n\nWent our separate ways, but when I reconnected with him year later, I was delighted to find he moved from oil to an office job.  He said it was way less stressful on his body too.",

If a pipeline isn't built, it may mean that more oil must be shipped by train -- which adds expenses, and causes oil to be more expensive.\n\nIf you're a person concerned about CO2 emissions, you want oil to be expensive, because it will cause the market to more quickly transition to other energy sources such as wind and solar.  Hence this is partly why environmentalists don't want pipelines to be built.",

For basketball the rule was changed in 1989 with the 1992 Dream Team being the first Olympics where NBA players could play. \n\nOlympics amateurism is now dead for every single sport with the sole exception of wrestling. If you're an Olympic wrestling then you're still an amateur. Boxing was the other last holdout, only allowing professionals after 2016.",

I have never before in my life so strongly desired that superheroes were real.\n\nEdit: To everyone telling me not to hope for heroes,  asking me what I plan to do, or why I'm not doing anything. Ok, let's do it. Let's organize. I've commented several times that we need to organize and every time I do it gets quiet. You want me to do something instead of complaining on the internet? Ok, let's do it. I'm willing to organize. Super heroes are a fantasy and it falls to us to do something about it. We won't get anywhere if no one does anything though. I'm reaching out. If you want to do something about this, lets go. I have to get back to my wage slavery now, I'll be back when my corporate masters have let me off my leash for the day. If no one commits to this but me, then dammit I tried.\n\nEdit2: I'm starting an online group somewhere tonight. PM me if you want in on this. We need to organize and I am not giving up.\n\nFinal Edit. We have a discord server now. PM for details.",

                            "comment": "We never will. \n\nSeriously, even if he wasn\u2019t murdered (which is also possible although unlikely), he was under 24/7 suicide watch after last week. \n\nIn the least corrupt situation the guards just were shit at their job, but far more likely they were paid of either by him or by people wanting him murdered to look the other way.\n\nEdit: apparantly he wasn\u2019t on suicide watch (anymore?), this wasn\u2019t in the article at my time of posting. Which just raises more questions imo.\n\nEdit2: I\u2019ve received over a hundred notifications of people telling me that he wasn\u2019t on suicide watch after I\u2019ve posted my edit that he wasn\u2019t on suicide watch anymore, and why that wasn\u2019t in my initial post. People, please read to the end of my message before accusing me of not reading properly.\n\nEdit3: I suggest for everyone to read the WaPo article written by a fmr US attorney and a professor of law, Harry Litman.\n\n\u2018For anyone familiar with Bureau of Prisons standard operating procedures,\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide\u00a0is more than mysterious; it is unfathomable. The 66-year-old accused sex trafficker was found dead in his prison cell at the Metropolitan Correction Center (MCC) Saturday morning, apparently after having hanged himself. The Bureau of Prisons, the federal agency that runs the MCC, has said the FBI will investigate. It had better. Epstein\u2019s death almost certainly means that astounding blunders occurred, perhaps by multiple personnel at the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). If any prisoner in the federal system should have been a candidate for suspicion of suicide, it was the high-profile and disgraced Epstein. All administrative and structural measures should have been in place to ensure it could not happen. And yet it apparently did.\n\nFirst, consider the MCC itself. It is a high-rise, forbidding administrative detention facility in the south of Manhattan. Its population consists almost entirely of prisoners, like Epstein, awaiting trial in federal court in Manhattan. It has been referred to as the \u201cGuantanamo of New York\u201d for its stringent security measures. It is the facility of choice for notorious federal defendants, often in special administrative segregation units, having previously housed John Gotti, Bernard Madoff, Omar Abdel Rahman and, recently, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. In other words, it is the very place to put a high-profile and potentially suicidal defendant such as Epstein. Second, consider the BOP\u2019s suicide prevention protocol.\u00a0Epstein was found last month unconscious\u00a0in his MCC cell with marks on his neck. If he was not on suicide watch, it would be astonishing. Yet if he were on suicide watch, his death would be virtually inconceivable.\n\nThe BOP\u2019s\u00a0suicide prevention protocol\u00a0entails, first and foremost, human eyes on the prisoner 24 hours a day. It also requires a strict deprivation of anything \u2014 shoelaces, sheets, pillowcases \u2014 that could possibly be used to hang oneself. It also requires disabling anything that could be used to tie a noose \u2014 vents, sprinkler heads, etc. Finally, we are not talking about inexperienced yokels. BOP personnel, especially at MCC, are the best professionals in the corrections industry, and they receive\u00a0special training\u00a0in administrating suicide prevention. Who better to guard against such a horrific development? At this point, questions abound, and BOP has to address them promptly.\n\nThe first: Was Epstein on suicide watch, and if not, why not? Among the reports cascading out in the few hours since Epstein\u2019s body was found are\u00a0anonymous statements\u00a0that Epstein had been on suicide watch but was taken off it. If so, the decision to remove him appears to have been a colossal error that must be thoroughly probed. The second: How exactly did Epstein manage to kill himself, and why exactly was it that he had access to the tools? Third, is there a video of Epstein\u2019s cell at the crucial time? There should be, and it will reveal exactly how and when Epstein killed himself. And none of this begins to address the royal mess it leaves in the efforts to take stock of Epstein\u2019s crimes and their prior slap-on-the-wrist treatment, nor the shambles in which it leaves Epstein\u2019s victims.\n\nAlmost certainly, we will know a lot more in a few days. But it seems certain that when the facts are known, this will stand as one of the biggest black eyes in the history of the Bureau of Prisons.\u2019",

So while it's shit that Epstein's dead, there are many more avenues to persue - providing law enforcement actually does its job here.\n\nETA ETA: These twitter threads do a great job at pulling out relevant and damning info from the 800 pages of info dumped yesterday.

An ordinary person on suicide watch would be checked every 15 minutes - and this guy was obviously no ordinary person. \n\nThere is no reasonable way for anyone who works in a jail to believe this was actually a dude who hung himself despite all proper precautions being in place.\n\nEDIT: As it turns out - **the highest profile inmate in the country, who had just attempted suicide a few days before** - was taken off of suicide precautions. And then this inmate who was threatening a member of the royal family, an ex-US president, an ex-US senator, the current president of the US, and a whole slew of millionaires and billionaires **was allowed the resources to kill himself.**",

If they **really want to be certain,** They put you naked inside a room with a camera, lights on 24 hours a day and a person at the desk watching you at all times.\n\nStart running your head into the wall? They will strap you to a bed, or in a chair to restrict your movement, then give you a shot in the ass full of a tranquilizer to put you to sleep\n\n**No possible way you can commit suicide if whoever is holding you is hell bent on trying to stop you. No fucking way at all.**",

I've done suicide watch. Everything you've said is correct. And tbh when I've done it it's been 1:1 - not even just 15 minute checks. There is no fucking way he was not murdered. I want to know what this prisons suicide watch policy is.",

Why was this allowed to happen? Why was he not under constant supervision?  Someone has to answer for this.  \n\nYou can keep someone alive in prison if you choose to.  This dude had even attempted it before, just last week.  I want a full investigation.\n\nConsidering some of the richest, most powerful people in the world were terrified of what this man would say.  The fact that this alleged suicide took place in one of America's most secure federal facilities.  The fact he was already under 24/7 suicide watch supervision.  I'd like to see the media refer to this as an \"alleged suicide\".\n\nEdit: Former DOJ Inspector General:\n\n&gt;The Bureau of Prisons is part of DOJ.  This should prompt an immediate and comprehensive DOJ Inspector General investigation to determine who is responsible.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mrbromwich/status/1160188012908691457?s=20\n\nNow we'll watch AG Barr fight against an investigation.",

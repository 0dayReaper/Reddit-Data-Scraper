That's because, until a few years later, the rule was that only one living man used the title \"President\", the actual current President.  For another example: I'm pretty sure, but don't have evidence immediately to hand, that after 1953, Truman was called \"Senator\".\n",

It's basically a slideshow that shows a celeb and you have to guess whether they are a) dead or alive and b) if dead, whether they really died that year or some previous year. \n\nWhen I was like 16, I was visiting my brother over winter break and I was helping him fill up the slideshow with celebrities. We needed to balance out the list with more old celebs who were actually still alive but more or less out of the spotlight. I looked up Gerald Ford and found that he was still alive, so I added him to the list and kept on looking for more. \n\nA few minutes later, I looked him up on Wikipedia again to add his birthdate to his slide. December 26th. Huh, that's today. Wait no, I'm looking at his death date. Wait, death date? He's on my 'still living' list! \n\nTurns out he had died in the few minutes it took me to look up whether he was still living or dead. And that's the story of how I basically killed Gerald Ford. ",

Apparently before Chris and his family's bodies were found there were already rumors that he wouldn't be performing at the next WWE event, presumably because he was either missing or acting strange. The guy who made the Wikipedia edit heard the rumors and added it to his wiki page, making up the part about his wife dying. He just coincidentally ended up being correct. \n\nAnd if you really think about it, anything other than a coincidence doesn't make sense. If this dude really did somehow know what happened before everyone else and wanted to leak the story, why would he say \"Chris will be replaced for the next show due to the death of his wife\" and not \"Chris will be replaced for the next show because he murdered his wife and kids and killed himself\"?

Homer doesn\u2019t hate Bush because of his political views, he hates Bush because he\u2019s a cantankerous old geezer (thank you Kent Brockman) who doesn\u2019t see eye to eye with himself. I believe the writers later considered it the precursor to the Frank Grimes episode.

I know that you have big shoes to fill.. well, quite frankly, you'll never be able to fill my shoes, believe me. In my 4 years of being the best president in the history of the United States, I've accomplished more than any other president, ever. All I ask is you don't mess up what I've built. I don't want that.  You don't want that.  Nobody wants that. Believe me.\n\nIt was a tremendous race and despite my efforts to dispel the fake news of the liberal media, there's nothing you can do.  Sad! I wish you the best of luck because you're gonna need it, believe me. \n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDonald J. Trump\n\nThe President of the United States",

While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Not merely for the years he spent as our forty-first President, but for the more than 70 years he spent in devoted service to the country he loved \u2013 from a decorated Naval aviator who nearly gave his life in World War II, to Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces, with plenty of posts along the way. Ambassador to the United Nations. Director of Central Intelligence. U.S. Envoy to China. Vice President of the United States.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*George H.W. Bush\u2019s life is a testament to the notion that public service is a noble, joyous calling. And he did tremendous good along the journey. Expanding America\u2019s promise to new immigrants and people with disabilities. Reducing the scourge of nuclear weapons and building a broad international coalition to expel a dictator from Kuwait. And when democratic revolutions bloomed across Eastern Europe, it was his steady, diplomatic hand that made possible an achievement once thought anything but \u2013 ending the Cold War without firing a shot.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*It's a legacy of service that may never be matched, even though he\u2019d want all of us to try.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*After seventy-three years of marriage, George and Barbara Bush are together again now, two points of light that never dimmed, two points of light that ignited countless others with their example \u2013 the example of a man who, even after commanding the world\u2019s mightiest military, once said \u201cI got more of a kick out of being one of the founders of the YMCA in Midland, Texas back in 1952 than almost anything I\u2019ve done.\u201d*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*What a testament to the qualities that make this country great. Service to others. Commitment to leaving behind something better. Sacrifice in the name of lifting this country closer to its founding ideals. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight \u2013 and all who were inspired by George and Barbara\u2019s example.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

A long-term care facility was the only place he could survive in that condition. \n\nOnce my grandma got sick, he had been long gone mentally and hadn't seen her in years. It didn't matter though. Make no mistake, two months after she died, he died too, and was buried on Veteran's Day.\n\nI'm not religious and not a believer in things happening for a reason, but it's so weird how hard the universe tries to make you believe differently.

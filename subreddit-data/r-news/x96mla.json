Another one worth knowing is sometimes they wait for people to *leave* before passing. \n\nMany cases where they're hardly awake, drugged up, and their SO or other family is there for days on end. The family member leaves for a night to wash up before continuing the watch, and within an hour of them leaving, the member passes. \n\nIt can be easy to develop guilt over this, but in the end it's the decision of the person passing. There's usually a level of comfort they need to pass, and once that's obtained, they go very quickly. Whether that's waiting for someone to arrive, or waiting for someone to go, or just getting the meds needed to relax and not be in so much pain, the through-line is that they've grown comfortable enough to move on. \n\nIn your case, you and your family arriving gave him that comfort. I'm glad you could be a part of that process for him.",

Whatever one might think of him, or her, or them together, she loved him completely and unconditionally, and he was there for her until the last seconds of his life.  Without him, it must have seemed so pointless to her.\n\nWhatever else, they are together again.

The penis doesn't assault a person, a sex offender does. Like some of y'all are so ridiculously hyperaware of other people's bodies. Yes, the patriarchy is real, but people's bodies are not some part of the patriarchy being thrust upon you. The issue is men and a masculine culture. Becoming the body police isn't going to make you safer. As someone born and raised as a woman, if someone wants to assault you a sign on the door isn't gonna stop them and you're not gonna have time to go tell on them.",

You can look it up.  And if you\u2019d like to play \u201cwhat about male prison guards\u201d I don\u2019t think they belong there either.\n\nMe?  I am not afraid of being raped by a transwoman with a penis at the spa.  I am not afraid of penises.  I do **not want to be around a male body with male genitals**.  And that\u2019s ok.  If it\u2019s not what society wants, I\u2019m just not going to put myself in situations where I would have to be around male nudity.  Gym?  I can buy my own equipment.  Communal changing rooms in stores?  I haven\u2019t been in one of those since the 90s do they still exist?  Women\u2019s restrooms are fine as we all have single stalls.  Couldn\u2019t care less.  Spas?  I\u2019ll hire a woman to come over if I wanted a massage or treatment.  No big deal.  Pool club?  I have a big, level backyard and don\u2019t mind putting one in.\n\nETA it\u2019s only strange people I don\u2019t want to see penises on.  I\u2019m fine with my boyfriend and even our occasional play partner who is trans.  Not afraid of her penis and like playing around with her chastity cage and her \u201clittle pee pee\u201d as she likes to call it.  The point is, it\u2019s normal to not want to be around the opposite **sex** when vulnerable nudity is taking place with strangers in a nonsexual public place where people are ignoring and stomping all over my consent.  \n\nTo be clear:  I would sit next to this woman in the hot tub while we had facials and bathing suits on in a spa.  If we were at a swinger party, nude beach, or private dungeon event where we all knew nude bodies of all sorts were going to be around and in the open?  Fine.  But a spa or a prison isn\u2019t any of those things and people go there with the expectation that they will be around other female bodies without male genitals in a safe haven to relax amongst other females.  Go get your bottom surgery and join us!",

Most trans people are hyperaware of bathrooms and avoid potential conflict \u2014 because they know they are frequently targets of harassment and violence and try to avoid it at all costs.\n\nPersonally I think trans people before bottom surgery should probably make sure the proprietors of an all nude establishment want them there before going, and avoid if not. But I don\u2019t like the idea of laws about this \u2014 what about intersex people, for example? Can they go to this spa? It would be best for all sides if this specific tiny fraction of the trans rights issue was not litigated in the court system.",

But sure, ignore all that to clutch your pearls that our bizarre, prudish sex/gender segregation is being violated. \n\nThe way to fix this is to make everything mixed use. Then we teach eachother to be vigilant for any perverts, and now there are more of us looking out for eachother (assuming the concept of perverts is why you're so upset about it). The only reason to block this is if you over-sexualize the human body to the point where you can't be naked with other people without it being sexual. And that's really a 'you' problem, you should get that checked out.",

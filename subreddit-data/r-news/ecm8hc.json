None of you stable geniuses are genius negotiators. But we are talking about calling your senator. It is an exercise in democracy. If you do not exercise, you get week and flabby. Get into the habit. Call your senator today. Sign a petition tomorrow. Vote in the primaries next year. Canvas next October. Vote next November. Even if you live in the deepest red state- every dollar they have to spend on ads and field offices is a dollar they can't spend on weaker candidates.\n\nedit4: FFS- I know their staffers read and answer calls not senators. For all the bitching and moaning you guys do about working retail with shitty customers, why in gods name do you think that senate staffers are immune to non stop complaints?

One would think that would be hella easy the first time around. but apparently not. the way the media covers trump 24/7, never being held accountable for any misinformation, only counting the stuff they get correct.\n\nWe've been in full parody mode since late 2014 and it'll be once again confirmed when they pick someone people just don't like. The Hillary-Donald election got a ton of people into politics but no one even voted. People my age (30's) still don't vote, yet they're so passionate and riled up online. the more people who vote, the better chance we have that the person who people want the most will win.\n\nEven people who write in joke candidates are willing to get off their butt and vote over people who pretend to care online. Another quality of the parody universe we're in. Trump is our president. A corporate rich guy from the 1980's and 90's. The guy from Home Alone 2. the guy in the Ghost Busters Bobby Brown Music video. Human trafficking is in full swing around the world and no one cares because things online are offensive so it gets talked about more. There's no way any of this isn't scripted.",

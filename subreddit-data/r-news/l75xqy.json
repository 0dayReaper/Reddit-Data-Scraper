MULTIPLE \u201crespectable\u201d financial institutions, including Citron, mocked people buying GME and consistently downgraded it. In retrospect it was fucking desperate.\n\nMy only regret about not getting into GME is not that I missed out on mad gains but rather I didn\u2019t get a chance to be a part of the biggest fuck you to rich, greedy fucks in American financial history.",

IMHO this is largely down to the absolutely irrational behavior of the market during Covid - I think a fair number of folks assumed that certain segments would take a big hit due to closures and consumer patterns during the pandemic and shorted the market accordingly. We generally haven't seen that pan out, so they're left upside down.\n\nI mean, the indication is that the US economy shrank 3+% last year, but the market is still going gangbusters - not hard to see how some 'conventional wisdom' bets on shorts didn't quite work out.",

This doesnt include susquehanna, dimensional, senvest, or the others who raked in hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nEdit: formatting.\n\nEdit 2: \n\n4.5 million shares owned by Susquehanna = $900,000,000\n\n4 million shares owned by Dimensional = $800,000,000\n\n3.5 million shares owned by Senvest = $700,000,000\n\n3.5 million shares owned by billionaire Donald Foss = $700,000,000\n\n2.6 million shares owned by State Street = $520,000,000\n\n2.4 million shares owned by GME Insider George E Sherman Jr = $480,000,000\n\n$4,200,000,000 +\n$4,100,000,000 = \n$8,300,000,000 total gained by the top GME shareholders, not including RC Ventures\u2019 9 million shares equaling another $1,800,000,000, for a grand total of over $10,100,000,000.\n\nEdit 3: minor mathematical correction.\n\nEdit 4: this intentionally does not include mutual funds and/or smaller investors. Its to highlight the big names who are raking in all that they can.\n\nEdit 5: (Jan 28th, market close value) multiply each of these cash amounts by 1.625 the get the value @ $325/share at market close on january 28th, 2021.",

People on Reddit noticed some big money had been driving down a company all year, cycling puts over and over, and created a negative bubble where they literally had to come up with 140% of the company stock in a short window.  The big guys kept doing it even after the company had some good guarantees of future earnings.  So, knowing a bunch of people are betting not only can they pick up every available stock lower than it was a month ago but they can then sell it and convince forty percent of those people to whom they sold the stock to sell it to them again at another loss within their window is a gold mine.  The company literally had Microsoft backing and the big money kept trying to roll the company into insolvency by sheer force of going on TV and client calls.  The manipulations were trying to roll a company for an entire year with their friends, creating that negative stock bubble, and abusing market access by pretending they can block consumers from participating as they and their friends try to exit their terrible positions.",

No one shorted 140% of float. $GME is different because the hedge funds shorted more shares than were actually available.\n\nI worry that a bunch of new investors are going to see that a company is shorted and then throw their money at it without understanding specifically *why* $GME blew up the way it did.\n\nEdit: [Short interest in $AAL is 25% to 30% of float](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/american-airlines-shares-soar-more-than-46percent-after-quarerly-results-short-interest-declines.html).

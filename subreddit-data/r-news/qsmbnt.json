Imagine a billion dollar conservatorship, controlled by the Kardashian family, for one of the best rappers of modern times.\n\nEDIT: Lindsay Lohan and Courtney Love were also targets of Lou Taylor, in fact, its the real reason both of them moved overseas. Courtney Love has been very vocal about this for anyone who is interested.",

The good news is it's likely not going to just be swept under the rug or haphazardly looked into (hopefully). I am pretty sure I heard at one point that they are using or going to use a forensic accountant. It would take an absolute financial mastermind to hide even like $1,000 from one of them if they're good, it's going to be extremely interesting to see what route they decide to take and how deep they're going to dig. Unfortunately it's not like that money is just going to be recovered from some hidden bank accounts, and a lot of it is likely just gone completely. If she really wants to push this though, then I would image there are a lot of (possibly well hidden) assets that have been accumulated over the years that she can go after if she wants. This will not be a quick process though, things like this can take years before courts even start ruling on any assets being seized",

Good for her, I hope she sits and rakes in cash while simultaneously going after anything that can be recovered that was literally stolen by her dad and everyone else involved. I was also glad to hear that the agreement to end this did at least involve having an accountant that retains just a bit of power. It ends up being a big shock to pretty much anyone who suddenly has almost unlimited money to spend, having a small cushion to help her properly land on her feet is hopefully going to be very beneficial. I'm guessing after everything that the court would scrutinize the hell out of the accountant too, so there shouldn't be much room to take advantage of her again",

The lawyer had to go along with the plan or the father to go along with the lawyer's plan, plus a rubber stamping judge, to bilk her of her money. To me, that is what looks like happened, and it wouldn't be the first time some rich woman was effectively institutionalized so unscrupulous people could steal her money. All it takes is a corrupt judge and a lawyer to make it work. My guess here is she wants to expose them all for what they are, and recovery of the money is secondary. Her lawyer (and Brit) is out for blood and he will get it, in her behalf, for the horror they put her through. And I will guess that she will go as far as to sue, then seize assets of all participants. Her knives are coming out and revenge is her driving force.",

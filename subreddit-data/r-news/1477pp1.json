Nobody should die over crap like this. \n\nThe other day in Florida, a mother of 3 young children was shot through a door and killed by her neighbor, in front of her 9 year old son, after the neighbor assaulted her children. What the FUCK, y'all.   What happened to \"treat others the way you want to be treated\"? What makes these kind of people think they have the right to murder anybody?",

Accidents and disease for instance are both more common, but get broken up into more specific subcategories.  By contrast all forms of firearms deaths, including suicides, homicides, and gun related accidents are grouped under a single category as gun violence.\n\nIt's also worth noting it requires a very specific analysis- it doesn't hold for instance for 1-17 year Olds(for whom if memory serves car accidents kill more than guns), and only pans out if 18 and 19 year olds are included in the pool which would indicate the observation has more to do with 18 and 19 year olds(a bracket that accounts for a similar number of gun deaths as 1-17 combined) than children as a class.\n\nGun violence is far too common in general in the states and undeniably more common than pretty much anywhere else in the developed first world, but this particular statistic is misleading and forgoes a more faithful explanation of the data in favor of the one that sounds more shocking.",

That's a big fear of mine here, and is not something that is solved by \"we need more good guys with guns!\" (I have a CWP; it doesn't stop bullets flying at me or my loved ones). We definitely need less bad guys with guns, first and foremost, but I don't see many politicians having the courage to do anything more than talk about it. Just bury our heads in the sand, listen to our own echo chambers, until a senseless and avoidable tragedy strikes us, and then it's too late to care.\n\nFriend of a friend got shot, and had her teenage son murdered, in a road rage incident near my house a few years ago. Yet I still have to remind my wife constantly not to road rage with people. People will shoot you over fucking nothing these days, no hesitation to ruin their lives and yours.",

Banning assault weapons is a knee jerk reaction to mass shootings but the majority of gun deaths are not mass shootings. From my standpoint it looks like a large minority of democrats is also pro-gun, which combined with the Republicans makes for a national majority.",

Why? The mother had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and decided she was going to leave the farm to both sons equally. \n\nRather than a future where they had two sons with large farms to provide for them, the father and son felt murder/suicide was a better option. They would rather be dead than see the other son inherit anything. Was the other son a monster? No, but he had gone off to college so was \"soft\" and elitist in their eyes and didn't deserve the farm.\n\nLand makes some people just go fucking bananas.",

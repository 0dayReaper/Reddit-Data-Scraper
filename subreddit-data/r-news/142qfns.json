She created beautiful paintings of children with big eyes. One was rejected for the 1964 World's Fair. Her husband took all the credit. She eventually left him and passed away last year.   \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Keane  \n\nhttps://www.boweryboyshistory.com/2014/11/robert-moses-rejected-this-terrifying.html",

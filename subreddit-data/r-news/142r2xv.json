This woman thought my wife was fucking with her, so she comes around and tries to force her way in to the 2ft between us and the car in front of us, mashing her rear quarter panel into our front right.\n\nI get out and start asking what the fuck she thinks she\u2019s doing as I see her bopping around in the cab and she gets out with a fucking gun belt on. She\u2019s an armed security guard. Lol. I get out my camera, loudly tell my wife to call 911 and tell them we just got sideswiped by an armed woman, then yelled at the goofy bitch to get the fuck back in her car if she was gonna go about this like that. (I\u2019m armed too because this if Florida and these fucking people exist, but I\u2019m also a combat vet and not exactly chomping at the bit to throw more PTSD on the pile, or even fuck up my day more than she already was. Madea Gets Hired by Brinks wasn\u2019t gonna turn into Madea Goes to Jail because *she* hit me and I didn\u2019t escalate anything more than calling her a crazy person.) 911 tells us to separate and stay there until the cops get there.\n\nThe cops come and facilitate info swapping. He doesn\u2019t want to ticket her because my wife didn\u2019t have her current registration, so he\u2019d need to ticket us as well but we clearly just had the misfortune of briefly intersecting with an actual lunatic. While I was getting her info she comments on the like 5th cop car that goes by and says \u201cI don\u2019t know why there\u2019s so many police around,\u201d I laughed and told her she got out of her car with a damn gun on her hip like it was Deadwood, what did she expect?\n\nFucking lady had The General and had stopped paying her insurance two months beforehand.\n\nJust life South of the Border, man.\n\nETA: I did file a complaint with the state regarding the whole thing and was contacted by staties to follow up but honestly I don\u2019t like dealing with cops if I don\u2019t have to, and I want to deal with this fucking woman even less so what\u2019s the fucking point of getting some sorta revenge if you have to roll around in shit to do it?\n\nPlus her life\u2019s probably fucked up enough already.",

Just watch the passengers in a manual.  They'll always have the head bob as the gear is changed.  And as someone who has driven and ridden in manual cars, it's a much better experience for the driver than the passengers.  Riding in a manual in traffic just gets annoying.\n\nManuals are fun for a second car.  But I wouldn't make someone ride in one for longer drives.",

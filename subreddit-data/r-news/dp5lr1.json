The most common \"malfunction\" was when people leaving the location.. would flip the breakers and shut off power to the entire site. I think maybe once or twice did I have to send a tech out to service a camera. As a high estimate, that's like 0.08% failure rate. With people who don't even understand security or tech or can't figure out how to operate a simple remote.\n\nThese things are designed to run 24/7 for years without problems. The chances of specific cameras failing or footage being unusable around a specific time during a specific, high-profile event at a prison that has minute-to-minute experience and heavily relies on these systems is so astronomically low that I'd call it the worst cover-up in the history of murder. And that's before the fact that during this specific instance of all this failure, two guards didn't make their rounds for unknown reasons but only the rounds that pass by this specific location.",

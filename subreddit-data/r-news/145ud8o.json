When your saliva enters another person, their immune system could be faced with bacteria it never encountered and not be prepared or know how to respond, leading to serious infections like sepsis or flesh eating disease.\n\nLast fact, making out with fellow humans is super healthy for you as you get to exchange a lot of oral bacteria in a safe way. It\u2019s basically a mutual mouth health and immune system exchange. Make out, for health!",

I had a red line from my cut on my finger all the way to my right shoulder. My finger was completely black. I was quarantined immediately as they thought I had flesh eating bacteria. \n\nFor anyone wondering \u2026 it was a matter of hours. I cut my finger at work. Got home from work around 11pm and had the red line to shoulder by like 6 am.",

Having your flesh cut off without effective anesthetic is less than ideal. Personal experience.",

The staff would carve away large strip of skin then watch to see if they got it all by seeing if the skin was still being eaten. He said the patient lost a lot of skin and it was crazy scary seeing how aggressive the bacteria was.",

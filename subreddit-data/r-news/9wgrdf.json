                            "comment": "&gt; beloved by billions of people.\n\nI'll see your beloved and raise you a \"Comic books helped me learn to read well enough to get me out of special ed.\"  \n\nBack when I was in elementary school I was years behind my class in reading, which is actually really impressive for a 1st grader when you take the time to think about it.  Worse still was the fact that my school, having been built 40 years earlier, was at full capacity long before special ed 'classrooms' could be assigned, so I and my six fellow special students (who ranged in specialness from \"I have difficulty with verbs\" to \"I have difficulty getting the paste stick out of my nose\") took our classes in a free broom closet.  Our teacher, Mrs. Lewis, did the best that she could with us, but since her students were so diverse she really couldn't tend to all of us the way that we needed.  \n\nSecond and third grade came and went with little improvement in me, it was becoming clear to everybody that I'd peaked at six years old, I was a one star boy, relegated forever to remedial reading.  \n\nLike any boy of the 90's though, there were two things that I loved: Video games and the X-Men animated TV show.  (Saturday morning was for ballers, back then.)  You may or may not remember, but comic books and everything related to them were a big flippin' deal there for a while, new cartoons coming out all the time, games, trading cards, anything to turn a property into a profit, and we were happy to give over our parents' money for it.  \n  \nThen came the two part animated special X-Men: Days of Future Past, and it was *awesome.*  In fact it was so awesome that I actually bought a book (*gasp!*) at the next Scholastic book fair (It was the 'novelization' of the episode) and I *loved* it!  Who knew reading could be so much fun?  Nobody had to shoot their dog!  \n  \nOf course comic book fans know that \"Days of Future Past\" was originally a story arc from the comics, so after I'd plowed through the thirty pages of novel in an afternoon (a big deal for me at the time) I went out and bought the comic books, which were even better!  I'd read and reread the graphic novels over and over again.  When presented with a word I didn't know (which were quite a lot, at first) I'd reach for the dictionary and figure it out.  These were everything I needed: Compelling bite-sized stories to entertain the mind, beautiful artwork for the eyes, and writing that neither spoke down to its audience nor spoke over it.  Comic books didn't intimidate the way a novel did (and if I'm being honest still does to this day), they weren't something that anybody said to me \"Don't bother reading that, Max, you won't get it.\"  X-Men opened a door, they made words fascinating where before they had been frustrating, they were everything I didn't know I needed.   I thought I was in love with X-Men, but then I discovered Spider-Man: A hero with an unerring moral compass and chronic depression.  He was just like me but with super powers and an unerring moral compass!  Talk about *exciting!*  Optic blasts and adamantium claws were awesome but difficult to relate to, but a 30-something photographer struggling to reconcile his heroic and humanistic nature was, like, way more awesome than claws!  (As an adult I realized that adamantium claws are both cooler and more useful than chronic clinical depression, but we all learn as we get older.)  Both Spider-Man *and* Peter Parker were characters that I could care about, relate to, and most importantly, invest my time and attention into.   \n\nOver the next decade or so I read comics by the pound, old stuff, new stuff, boring stuff, exciting stuff, smart stuff, stupid stuff, whatever I could get my eyes on, and right in step with that reading was an improvement in my grades.  I'd started school years behind my classmates, but by middle school I'd been moved up to \"Merit\" (read: grade level) classes, then in high school I moved up again to Honors and AP.  Comic books really opened the world up for me, they were a most necessary stepping stone without which I don't think I'd ever have cleared the ledge.  Some of us are neither Anakin *nor* Obi Wan, we need middle ground to get where we're going; comic books were my middle ground.  \n  \nWithout Stan Lee and Spider-Man I wouldn't be the man I am today, that's no exaggeration.

Although I didn\u2019t see him there in any official capacity, I swear to this day that I had my own little Stan Lee cameo. At the very end of the convention, when everyone was leaving, I was waiting outside the hotel/venue to be picked up. While waiting, I saw a man walk right by me who looked JUST like Stan Lee, rolling a suitcase behind him. I didn\u2019t see anyone with him, and it didn\u2019t (still doesn\u2019t) make sense other than the fact he was an attendee - but the resemblance was uncanny. Whether it was actually him or not, it was a cool moment I\u2019ve remembered fondly all this time, and I\u2019ll certainly be thinking about it today. My own little Stan Lee cameo.",

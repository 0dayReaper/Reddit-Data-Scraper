Since I'm sure they triage roughly in the order of need, unless your family has been killed and eaten by Ted Bundy, you're probably going to struggle to make that list.\n\nCritical vacanacy tends to kick in around when you're 10-20% understaffed.  Certainly by 30%.  At 84%, it's more like critical existence failure. I'm sure trans kids can join the long list of kids who aren't getting any visits to the psychologist.",

I've seen Gadsden flag license plate covers and used as window curtains. I had to tell my coworker a few days ago that the pride flag was NOT A PEDO FLAG because he asked me why we have hate flags everywhere now because he saw a Tiktok saying it was. I've been handed several Christian pamphlets while working because \"You look like you need it\" because I have facial piercings. I had a \"newspaper\" dropped on my doorstep called \"Druthers\" in December 2021 that I held onto because it was so hilariously filled with anti-vax I couldn't stop laughing at it. I just pulled it out from my desk and it's got a cartoon of Dr Fauci as the grim reaper under the title \"8 Reasons to NOT jab your children\". page two is \"Why is no one talking about informed consent?\" and page 3 is about \"the Nuremberg Code\" just to give you a taste of what is in it.\n\nNB is already Florida.",

I have a running list of some of the most insane headlines I've seen in them (have never read past the headlines).

(this one has a large cartoon of a kid looking in the mirror and reads \"When Kathy is Keith\" on top)\n- The Documentary \"They\" Don't Want You To See\n\nIt's some of the most brain dead shit I've ever seen.",

It feels like everyone around me falls for sensationalist talking points and there's a market for these publications sadly. I think I'm the only person on my road with a PC. Only a handful of my neighbours on my road have smart phones which they use for exclusively Facebook, making these flyers a viable way of getting to their target audience. My friend I stopped talking to during the lockdown because he wouldn't STFU about COVID hoaxes sent me a text out of the blue yesterday. After months of not talking or answering his calls/texts he said \"FYI &lt;link to hacker news about how the virus was leaked from Wuhan lab&gt;\". It's still obviously consuming him that I adhered to the lockdown, got vaccinated/boosted and didn't give a fuck about where it came from while he flip flops on it being JuSt A fLu BrO to the greatest bioweapon every created.\n\n On a lighter note: We recently had our wood stove replaced with mini splits and most of the Druther's I got were used as firestarter so at least they weren't 100% useless garbage.",

Obama took it (even though he would still be living in Washington), as did GWB before him (to fly home to Midland, TX). Hell, it even happened in the West Wing! As for flying to Andrew AFB, this is not unusual. This is the safest and quickest way to get the press there.\n\nJust because he has his own plane doesn't mean he should use it. He likely cannot land it at AFB, and can't be expected to fly from a civil airport (as a foreigner, I can tell you that would be embarassing for the country, not just him).",

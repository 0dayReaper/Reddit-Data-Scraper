The water is always going to be going down for the next 100 years.\n\nLook at the satellite image.\n\nPreserving the exposed canyons, a park for the newly exposed canyons as the lake disappears is a great dual purpose.

It could totally be protected as a national park instead of a national recreation area as early as tomorrow. The biggest holdup is that the NPS administers everything there except grazing, which is managed by the BLM for annoying historical reasons. The two agencies butt heads a lot. That's why elevated protection really isn't in the cards.",

There's no issue with flow on the Columbia.\n\nNow Lake Mead? Lake Powell? Yep.  Mead in particular could fall too low for power generation; thankfully El Nino rains should help with that (El nino means the tradewinds are stronger, which flips the script on rainfall patterns, soooo El Nino=wet SW/dry NW, La Nina=dry SW/wet NW). The compact on the Colorado is ridiculous and needs to be rewritten. If i were Mexico, Id sued for their missing water since the river runs dry before it even hits the delta.",

Probably it would also mean building ranger stations and new roads and facilities, thereby increasing traffic and  limiting fishing, hiking, canyoneering and rafting to a permit system.\n\nYou can already see the effects on other popular parks in the region - Zion, Arches, Canyonlands. These places are steadily becoming less wild as park visits surge. Its hard to enjoy the pristine beauty of Arches in a 4-hour car line to get into the park. Similarly, does the conga line of visitors to the summit of Angels Landing really improve the parks beauty?\n\nDon\u2019t give me wrong I\u2019m all about access. America\u2019s national parks are amazing places or people in wheelchairs, people with disabilities, and city folks can enjoy and be exposed to nature. But does every \u201ccool canyon\u201d and beautiful, wild corner of America have to have an attendant visitors center, parking lot, and paved trail leading to it?\n\nKeeping the region as a national recreation area is fine.",

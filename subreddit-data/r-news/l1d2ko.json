Also fun fact technically Biden is 45th president since we count Cleveland twice.\n\nEdit: Since I keep getting criticized for the word \"technically\". Id like to play the \"English is my third language\" card.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of people keep asking: We count Cleveland twice because he didn't serve two *consecutive* terms. Benjamin Harrison served between his two terms so Grover Cleveland is the 22th and 24th president of the united states. FDR was able to serve almost 4 terms (he died serving his 4th) because the 22nd amendment, the one mentioning term limits. Wasn't introduced before 1951. But since Washington called it quits after serving 8 years (1789-1797) it was considered common courtesy to leave after two terms.",

I think he quietly supports barring Trump from office... at the very least. McConnell\u2019s statement yesterday was pretty pointed, and I\u2019d guess Pence supports those sentiments.",

All business.  \n\nAnd here Trump is trying to start a \"Patriot Party\" and Biden loves this country more than Trump ever will. It must drive Trump crazy that Biden is quickly going to wash his hands of him and then ignore him.",

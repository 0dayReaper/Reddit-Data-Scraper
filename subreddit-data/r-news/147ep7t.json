How much of the critical infrastructure and housing will have been deliberately levelled as part of a denial strategy?  Russia is pretty famous for using scorched earth tactics when they are retreating.  \n\nWorse yet, will some of the areas more deeply held or that have been held for a longer period of time like Crimean and Eastern Donetsk just be filled with mass graves full of Ukrainians and their homes are now occupied by ethnically Russian settlers and ethnic Russians who were there before the war?  Then what is Ukraine supposed to do with those people?  Arrest them enemy agents?  Deport them?  Shoot them?  Eastern Europe and the world are going to be dealing with the fallout from this war for decades.  The Balkan wars were a terrifying time in the 90s but honestly I think this is going to be FAR worse.",

It's the tradeoff that matters:\n\n- Breaking of Russian morale\n\n- retaking territory that's lost\n\n-furthermore dimming the Russian stockpile, which isn't growing due to limited production.\n\n-giving the Wagner group another reason to abandon Russia\n\n-destruction of enemy divisions, which they can not replace.\n\n\n\nSo Ukraine is doing quite well. With another advantage: those lost tanks? Most likely be replaced with something on par. (So not T-50s and boys with just 3, weeks of 'training')",

It was all over r/combatfootage for the past few days. \n\nUnfortunately these things are gonna happen. \n\nHowever, RuZZians have been posting pictures of the same destroyed equipment, from different angles, claiming all sorts of stuff. It\u2019s getting out of hand on a few pro-Orc subreddits that are still out there.",

Losses are expected, especially when making an attack on an entrenched enemy. But it appears the vehicles performed as designed to protect the crews and be repairable.",

There\u2019s some overlap as well, presumably. But my point doesn\u2019t really hang on whether he personally earned it. He could\u2019ve inherited every dime and profit interest he has and the fact remains that he can\u2019t possible be anti-corporate while maintaining those interests. \n\nTo be clear, this is not a per se attack on anyone who earns money from corporations, whether passively or through actual employment. I\u2019m just tired of politicians being allowed to run on platforms that are blatant and verifiable bullshit.",

The fact that the UK is listed as a \u201cfull democracy\u201d when the monarch literally has the power to dissolve all democratic institutions in the country by stroke of a pen, is utter nonsense. I get that doing that would be political suicide, but their monarchy is *absolute*. And while \u201cdemocracy\u201d has existed in the country for hundreds of years (mostly reliably) it only takes one rogue decree to get rid of it (it\u2019s happened before, another Charles). By definition, this is not democracy, despite their implementation of their parliamentary system.",

The democratic and constitutional state is not graciously permitted by the monarch, it cannot be abolished by the monarch, which is precisely why the UK is a full democracy.\n\nI cannot begin to envision the mental acrobatics you had to undertake to come to your conclusion.",

It applies when convenient, and requires a contrived and esoteric legal analysis to understand in its entirety. There is no formal written document.  The only formal written documents that guide that government are those given royal assent. Even if the courts uphold laws concerning the sovereign, that sovereign had to first give assent to those laws, and even then, the sovereign is immune from all prosecution. \n\nThis whole circular reasoning of \u201cwell the monarch is restricted by the constitution, the constitution is established in a body of case law, but the monarch also approves the laws but is also above the law\u201d is just absolutely absurd. A wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing \u2014 and absolute monarchy under the guise of a parliamentary constitutional democracy. Let\u2019s call a spade a spade.",

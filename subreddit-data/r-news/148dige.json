When asked why, it\u2019s because of the housing crisis, the government does not want homeless people to run away to the woods so they can live off the land. You might think he is just fucking with me, but it tracks with the other bullshit  he claims.",

Not because of the underlying Wildfire risk but because of the infrastructure that was put in place during that year. Many many fire breaks that did not previously exist were created, operation centers were stood up all over the state and emergency Wildfire operations were improved and consolidated for better management.\n\nWildland fires are going to happen no matter what. Sparked more commonly by humans but often by lightning as well, you can't stop them from starting. Managing risk and access is what is most important. One of the biggest issues with the fires in Canada is that they are truly Wildland fires and access is a huge problem. After the devastating fires this year there will be a lot more infrastructure in place.",

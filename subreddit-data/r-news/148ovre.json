I have been consistently earning the top performance rating every year for the past 8 years. The top performance rating is very hard to get. The upper echelon of upper management has to sign off on each nomination.  But the reward for this achievement is just an extra 16 hours of leave.  Which isn't anything to sneeze at, don't get me wrong.  But I'd much prefer a permanent pay bump, especially since we don't get an automatic COL adjustment.  A top performer should not have to get a job offer from another agency or company just to get a modest pay increase. Their top performance should be enough justification.   Yet that's the kind of shitty game we have to play where I work.  \n\nFor the first time in 16 years, I'm seriously considering jumping ship. \nI like getting the top performance rating, but I hate feeling like I'm being played.",

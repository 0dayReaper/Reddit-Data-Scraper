In fact businesses get a tax credit for hiring the disabled. \n\n\nOne of my elderly neighbors was pissed at ACA cause somehow she was funding blacks and mexicans who didnt need it.. and yet admitted ACA saved her money for the year, and she no longer would find herself stuck in the prescription doughtnut hole anymore. SHe litterally kept more of her money each year but somehow was paying more for blacks and mexicans despite she was paying less.\n\n\nIts not really a joke when i say a republican will happily shoot themselves in the foot, as long as they are stepping on the foot of a dem when they do so.",

People belittle online debate because the participants (especially if one is bad faith) don\u2019t tend to change each other\u2019s minds. But that\u2019s not the point. The point is to make your case to your own and their audience so that when they go to repeat that talking point their guy says verbatim they have a flicker of memory of someone else tearing that point apart. Tone matching, different rhetorical methods, understanding the basics of different philosophies and logical (or illogical) systems of thought, and recognizing not only bad faith actors but the form of bad faith they are exploiting (and the best way to handle it) - these are all skills that are useful on a debate stage, in comment sections, and with the people in our lives. \n\nMost people are just repeating shit they heard that sounded \u201cright\u201d to them. Inoculating others against the bad ideas that go uncontested with an effective rebuttal is genuinely helpful. Just go in with a clear goal and know your limits so you aren\u2019t running yourself mentally and emotionally ragged dealing with other people\u2019s idiocy. It\u2019s not your job, but it\u2019s not a bad way to participate when you have the energy. \n\nSincerely - someone who took a while to learn this after burning out a few times lol",

This is the culmination of their decades of vilifying minorities, defending - and often praising - every stand your ground case, and the more recent Trump-driven celebration of \"speaking without consequence.\"\n\nNo doubt this shooter has watched Fox News non-stop for years. She probably feels like yelling hateful things at her Black neighbors is a first amendment right, and that since Trump took control of the Republicans they've been able to just say the quiet parts out loud. When the mom came to confront her for stealing her children's property, the shooter probably DID fear for her life - she's been told at every turn possible that Black people are violent and here's one banging on her doors and windows, mad that her children's stuff was taken. So then, \"fearing for her life\", she turns to her Fox News Approved 2nd Amendment right to own a gun \"to defend her life and property.\" In her mind, as long as she doesn't open the door and let the mom in, it's both faceless and \"random\" - she doesn't have to see her victim and she can disconnect her actions from the consequences: she was just \"shooting to get the mom to leave\" and \"didn't expect to actually hit her\" or something along those lines. \n\nHer version of the story is filled with \"official sounding\" terms. She calls the neighborhood kids \"juveniles.\" She claims the children have told her they'd kill her. She claims she told the children to leave then the mom came to her door saying she'd kill her also and that she believed that to be the case. Her statement to police:\n\n&gt; \u201cnever intended to hit the victim when she fired the gun and thought she \u2018hit\u2019 really high when she shot.\u201d\n\nEvery aspect of these shootings we've been seeing recently over the most mundane, harmless interactions is entire based on right-wing media pumping their audience full of fear and misinformation. They're so on-edge about everything happening in America cuz every single thing is attack on their \"American values\" that they refuse to turn Fox News off so they can \"be informed.\" Then, like opening a coke that has been shaken violently for a long time, as soon as the cap gets twisted a little bit it just explodes.\n\nThen other viewers of those media sources, to your last point, circle the wagon in effect. They've all been radicalized in the same way, so they have to justify those actions otherwise they're just as bad as the person they're hearing about. \"Well the mom had the cops called on her 8 times in the past, that shows she has a history of acting out\" while ignoring the most likely prospect that it's probably because the shooter has antagonized the family before repeatedly in the past and the mom doesn't put up with it. Of course, this is all spoon fed to them by the sources also trying to avoid any and all responsibility for this culture we live in.",

How can you yell racial slurs at kids, have the police called on you TWENTY times by your neighbors, not to mention all the other nonsense she got up to like putting \"no trespassing\" signs on public parts of the apartment property, and not get evicted? Surely they were also complaining to apartment management as well...?",

That black lady did not have to die..and yet she did and if there is to be blame besides the obvious lady who shot her and the db law that she used to enable her actions, I blame society.  \n\nWhen people tell you that someone is inciting racial terror/violence, don't just sit by and do nothing....  Those kids did not deserve to hear that crap.   All you folks who believe that racism is gone...please answer why those kids who are several generations removed from slavery and the Civil Rights era of the 50s and 60s had to endure that?  Yes..this is the same state that Dumb DeSantis did away with CRT (edited: which he believes means anything having to do with Black history) in Florida's schools and universities because he doesn't want white kids to feel sad about the past...but I guess it's okay for them to feel empowered about that past shit. Has any decent reporter asked DeSantis about this????   NAACP said it...Florida is not safe for Black folk and this proves it.  \n\nIf you are a white person and you hear that another white person is inciting racial terror/violence, please confront that person.  When you don't, it's like you are consenting to their actions and might as well have a hand in them.  If you are a cop and someone is reporting this, do your damn job...deescalate and do what you can to put a stop to it.  If you are a lawmaker, write some laws that clearly outline that racial terror is illegal and make it so that it will cost the perpetrator dearly both criminally and legally.  \n\nAlso, please bother to read the books by the Acho brothers: Conversations With a Black Man and Change Starts With You.  These are two very powerful books to read if you want to learn and do something about racial injustice.",

They called them the n word, told the 5 year old that their dogs eat \"little n words\", slashed the woman's tires and the grandson and his girlfriend even cornered the woman in our complex parking lot with a gun.  I called police at least 6 times in 2 months.  Each time they came and left and nothing happened.  Finally one night I could hear her starting up again, screaming \"you little n***ers better get out of here\" and the youngest kid crying. I lost it and went outside and started screaming at this woman. I wanted to hit her, to hurt her after all she'd been doing.  I called the cops one more time and told them what was happening.  I wound up spitting on the ground at the woman's feet, telling her she was disgusting and going back inside once the kids were safely in their own apartment.  When the police arrived they knocked on my door and asked what was going on.  They go downstairs to talk to this woman and she tells them I spit ON HER and she wants me arrested.  Guess who got arrested and served a year of probation?  Myself and the black neighbors moved that weekend.  No justice ever served, but at least we are all alive.",

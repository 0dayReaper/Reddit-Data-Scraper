It caused a *minor* wobble at speed and some abnormal front tire wear. Got the stabilizer and about 90% of the tires covered under warranty.  \n\n\n\nThe lawsuit was because the stabilizers started failing on new JL Wranglers almost immediately, and Fiat wanted to just take care of all of them under warranty. They were downplaying the failure rate to avoid a recall. My speculation is that the part simply couldn't deal with the taller tires common on JL Wranglers (vs JK Wranglers), and any vehicle with the oversized tires was destined to have the stabilizer fail at some point.",

The issue with the JL Wranglers which prompted the steering stabilizer recall was nothing close to that, but the media ran with it and called it a death wobble anyways.",

My base model JK Wrangler Sport was an objective piece of shit for basically anything - except for doing exactly what it was designed to do (offroad), and for selling used for basically the same thing I paid for it brand new after 40k miles and 4 years. So I bought a JL Wrangler. This time a custom order loaded Rubicon. They fixed a lot of the piece of shit feel, it's much more comfortable on the highway, and it's even better at doing exactly what it was designed to do. Plus I've had it for 30k miles and 4 years now, and it blue books for about $5k less than I paid for it. \n\n\nThis is coming from a place of basically NEVER having any equity in my vehicles ever, or only having a couple grand to roll into the next purchase. I've got 30k in equity in my Rubicon that will be paid off next year. I can put up with a lot of bad things in a vehicle when the financials look like that.",

While vehicles are never to be considered sound financial investments, from my perspective the Jeep Wrangler is downright amazing in that department. I've owned 2 Wranglers since 2013 and I've never had any major issue with either of them. Both were relatively inexpensive to maintain to a high standard, and they've held value at least as good as a Toyota Tacoma. I couldn't care less why these vehicles hold value like they do, but the simple fact is they do better than almost anything else on the market. This is objective truth. If you're going to have to buy a vehicle anyways, it's not a bad choice.",

Pretty much every vehicle brand and every individual vehicle took a serious quality hit over the last couple years. I personally intend to avoid every single vehicle manufactured between early 2020 and early 2023 regardless of brand. \n\n\n\nCheck the pre-COVID lists though. 2011/2012 through 2020 the Wrangler basically traded the top spot with a Toyota Tacoma.\n\n\nEdit: I wanted to edit to add that your list from 2023 still puts Wranglers at #9. Out of the 432 vehicle models on the market in 2023, that puts the 2023 Wrangler in the top 2%.",

The very thing that used to set them apart from the competition is essentially being done as well (or better) by others. Their 4WD capabilities are nothing special anymore, and haven't been in at least 20 years imo. \n\nPretty much every newer Jeep I see on the road looks like it's never even seen dirt ffs. What's the point? Seems like many of their buyers are a buncha posers sacrificing ride comfort, gas milage, and reliability for mostly aesthetic reasons and/or being a brand simp. \n\nWhatever Jeep's \"thing\" is now, can be someone else's problem lol",

They are still very capable offroad, but the rest of the lineup is nothing special like you said. \n\nThey went away from solid axles after cancelling the XJ and the model change from WJ Grand Cherokees to Wk Grand Cherokees in the mid 00s. They also did away with the inline 6 cyl engine as well. I never got into the Wranglers, but still have a 2dr manual XJ! No desire to own any of the newer Jeeps from the past 20 yrs.",

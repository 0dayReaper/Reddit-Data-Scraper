For example, South American countries love Chinese money, but they may not have the same level of affection for China itself. So, it's relatively easy for China to invest in infrastructure projects in those countries, but it's more challenging for them to gain significant influence. China primarily utilizes its financial resources as the main means to spread influence, which differs from the approach taken by the USA, which used movies, fast food, and other cultural influences. China doesn't see any financial interest in Cuba, and that is probably why. Cuba and the US relationship is very complex and a misstep from China could backfire. They know that and probably is something they are taking in consideration.",

And in that vein, I think this new development by itself isn't actually much of a game-changer in strategic terms, but we could try to understand that it represents a point China's trying to make towards us. \n\nHowever, I would disagree that \"movies, fast food, and other cultural influences\" are at the core of the U.S. approach -- that is the velvet glove over the iron fist.\n\nThe U.S. is first and foremost a major security provider, both in traditional and non-traditional areas. It is also a major provider of aid and assistance. And while China certainly has advantages when it comes to economics (commercial investments in infrastructure, yes, but also trade), the U.S. continues to have enormous influence through the dollar-dominated financial system, which it uses to arguably its greatest (and most egregious) extent in Latin America -- against Cuba, but then also Venezuela. I won't say that the peoples of Latin America don't see the U.S. with some affection, but I think it's a complicated relationship that reflects the complicated history of the last 2-3 centuries.",

The presence of Netflix, Disney, Warner, movies, TV shows, fast-food chains, the use of English words, and cartoons has heavily influenced South America with American culture. People have grown up under the influence of America for the last 30-40 years, and it is not something that can be easily replaced.\n\nOn the other hand, China has minimal cultural influence in the region. People in South America are more influenced by Japanese culture, largely due to trade agreements in the late 1980s and early 1990s. China is primarily seen as a source of cheap goods and infrastructure funding. Another issue regarding China's influence in the region is that they are trying to attract people who have negative opinions about the United States, rather than those who have a positive perception of China. These are very distinct factors to consider.\n\nThese facts make Chinese influence much more complicated compared to that of Americans in these countries. While anti-American sentiment is growing, I do not see a corresponding pro-China sentiment emerging in the opposite direction. It is increasingly becoming just an alternative option.\n\nBy the way, I was born there, so I am speaking from personal experience.",

Eisenhower decided to send Nixon instead and Nixon relayed to Eisenhower that Castro was a full fledged communist. That meeting essentially ended all chances of the US and Cuba keeping diplomatic relations as Castro then went to the Soviet Union for support. On top of that, there\u2019s an interesting story with Guantanamo Bay. Long story short, the US controls Guantanamo through a legal agreement and still pays the lease on the land. However, Castro never once cashed in the check the US would send. Instead, he apparently had a pile of all the payments sitting on a part of his desk. Using the checks would\u2019ve acknowledged US control over a part of Cuba. Then there\u2019s the whole CIA assassination attempts, Bay of Pigs, and Cuban Missile Crisis. Pretty easy to see why Castro hated the US",

We've waged wars, supported coups, and run other operations all over the world for the same reason.\n\nOur dealings with Cuba are somewhat unique because they're very close to us, and have been very resilient.

There are some real nutjobs in here who just hate the US so much they can't even read things straight (in case you were wondering, you are one of them).\n\nedit: Here, I will break down my point.  You see, China and Cuba have shitty autocratic governments that would be making these kind of deals with or without US trade.  My statement had fuck all to do with the US other than they happen to be the nation that trades with China but not with Cuba.  In fact the only thing I really state about the US is I don't agree with the sanctions.  That's it.  What the fuck did you read?",

U.S. military aircraft fly over the South China Sea, engaging in electronic surveillance. The U.S. sells arms to Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, deploys a small number of troops there to train its military, and sails Navy ships through the Taiwan Strait. An eavesdropping facility in Cuba would make clear \u201cChina is prepared to do the same in America\u2019s backyard,\u201d said Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a national-security think tank in Washington.\n\nTit, meet Tat.",

This choice is already facing immense legal challenges and will be litigated for quite a while. \n\nIf or when the rules do get repealed, there won't be immediate changes that seem negative. Companies won't just dump a new pricing structure on customers as soon as they can. It'll start by them advertising and offering \"premium\" packaging, perhaps advertising \"Stream Netflix seamlessly in 4k with our exclusive premium media package!\" and other such things. It will be framed as a benefit for the consumers. \n\nOnce that model is normalized, you can expect them to start itemizing content access more and more like cable, eventually leading to various internet packages like we've seen used in arguments against this decision.",

I believe our founding fathers enshrined freedom of speech/press because it's fundamental to democracy and a strong society. NN is just as fundamental. No government nor company should be able to interfere with the speech of Americans. NN is a fundamental freedom. If veterans can speak out about their expectation that the freedom for which they sacrificed extends to things like NN, then people might listen.\n\nSomeone once gave me a great piece of advice. Reporters work in the MEDIA. They are the medium through which people can tell their story. They're also lazy. If you wrote a newspaper article and contacted a news paper, there is a good chance they will publish all or part of your story.\n\nI'm not a good writer, but I could help you write a newspaper article about the subject. I bet some subreddits would help you craft something good. Then start emailing reporters and asking if they're interested in your story. You, as a veteran, probably have more clout here than most",

Also, Congress could move to investigate Pai and the FCC. There's still several battles to be fought on several fronts before net neutrality is truly gone.\n\nEdit 2: Complacency is the enemy of freedom. This is a setback, but there's more to do. Best way to avoid getting disheartened is to treat this as a problem and focus on the solutions, not get discouraged because three assholes believe their views match the rest of us.\n\nEdit 3: The bill talked about *can* still work, but we have to push Congress to avoid compromise as is being discussed and have it be a true net neutrality bill. Advocacy can provoke change. See the progress made in civil liberties based on gender and sexuality, as well as the ongoing fight over immigration. All because we collectively advocate for change. ",

I explained to my dad what it even was yesterday (he had no clue beyond that it was \"government regulations\") and he admitted that he agreed that ISPs would take advantage of consumers, that they shouldn't be able to prioritize certain traffic, that there is no ISP competition etc. But by the end of the conversation he still wanted it repealed because, and I quote, \"I obviously don't know as much about it as other people, but no matter what it's government regulation, so it's bad\".\n\nSo no, unfortunately in some areas of the US it really is not unanimous at all. People can hear all the evidence, agree with it, and still decide to stick with their party, and support their corrupt representatives that voted to repeal NN.\n\n**Edit** - Some people think I brought up Trump as an insult. I didn't. It's just the defining feature of these people that I know. I'm sure it's not universal. Also, my family members aren't stupid, I don't want to misrepresent them. They are intelligent people, some of them have had successful careers as engineers of all kinds. They are just caught up in this horrible team-sports side of US politics that focuses more on being \"right\" than actually evaluating issues logically.",

The best shake anyone else gets is the opportunity to go into debt to get an education and then work a job until you drop dead with the hopes by then you've paid off a house and a car. Then live off whatever is left of your retirement or social security. When the pension is unheard of thanks to efforts dismantling unions and social security it a constant topic to get gutted. \n\nThe rich got theres and they want to keep it that way. Why share a slice of the pie when you've literally been the only one to have it your entire life.",

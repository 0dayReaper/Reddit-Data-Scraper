They've never had family members die or end up with life-altering, permanent effects from these diseases.\n\nAlso, even if their kids do get terribly sick, they just assume that modern medical technology will save the kid.  Like that kid who almost died from tetanus, and his parents refused the DTaP booster after the kid was released from the hospital (he was given the first dose as part of his treatment in the ICU).  It's all okay, because even if he gets sick again the doctors will save him!  No need for vaccines, obviously. /s\n\nWhereas autism and other behavioral/development disorders get a lot of press and a lot of exposure in popular media.  To them, that specter is more real than the idea of their child dying from a \"normal childhood illness\".\n\nI was showing my kid my chickenpox scars the other day (no vaccine when I was a kid). I was terribly sick for a long time, and missed a lot of school as well.\n\nI'm so freaking glad that my kid won't have to get sick like that.  Thank you vaccines for helping my kid grow up healthy.",

So when journalists were involved to spread awareness on this terrible case, the no-vax people replied in kind, doxxing the parents and sending hordes of people to vandalize their facebook pages, tormenting them and sending death threats. All because they were trying to force their *pure and innocent* children to get vaccinated instead of just letting the sick son die and call it a day.\n\nI don't want to see children pay for it, but it's clear that the situation is getting out of hand and the government HAS to do something about it.\n\nEDIT:  [source](https://www.abruzzolive.it/la-famiglia-del-bambino-guarito-da-leucemia-schedata-dai-novax-la-mamma-ora-abbiamo-paura/).

Thousands of people choke every year while eating, and hundreds of those people die. That's why I don't feed my kids. It's dangerous. Now plenty of people will point out that food supposedly \"prevents starvation,\" and that might be true, but it's not fair to completely ignore all the dangers food poses, like choking, allergies, gingivitis, and garlic breath. I'm just saying, do your own research and decide what you think is best for your kids. If you choose to give your kids potentially deadly food, that's your problem, but as a parent, I don't think the government has any right to tell me that I need to feed my kids.",

There will be massive famines, droughts, and people migrating in enormous numbers trying to survive. This will lead to wars and an increase in violence generally.\n\nTo avoid that, we'd need countries like the US and others to treat this as WWII, mobilizing the economy to take drastic steps as fast as possible to mitigate additional greenhouse emissions and working on technology that can efficiently sequester existing CO2 out of the atmosphere on an enormous scale.\n\nThat doesn't seem remotely likely. We'll continue to gradually become more efficient, and gradually lower greenhouse gas emissions in wealthy countries while China and India continue to increase greenhouse emissions at a faster rate than they're cut in wealthy countries. We won't start lowering global greenhouse gas emissions probably for at least another few years, much less dropping it down to zero. And even dropping it to zero won't be enough, there's already too much greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that needs to be sequestered if we want to stabilize the climate enough to avoid massive new areas of the world becoming uninhabitable to humans.\n\nI can't even imagine what it would take to convince people that we need to immediately take steps in order to avoid enormous strife in the future. And it's not like the distant future, probably 20-30 years from now at most. But few care about that far in the future, no matter how obviously bad it will be or how irreversible it'll be at that point.",

I saw fatal and skipped the word beaten.\n\n\nSo if I read it correctly I might have gotten to Tyre faster. I\u2019ll never know because those were the ones who popped in my head.\n\n\nFeels weird I can\u2019t tell if you were trying to say \u201csee it\u2019s not that bad\u201d or you were genuinely curious.\n\nEdit: oh and obviously King he\u2019s first that comes to my mind and based on your post history I was wrong to answer honestly. You\u2019re out to prove racism isn\u2019t real when it obviously is. It was just a chance for you to get on your soap box to proclaim racism isn\u2019t real but then you say something racist\n\nSecond edit\nApologizes to the user, I just get defensive because I\u2019m exhausted this keeps happening and people keep pretending it doesn\u2019t. My bad. I\u2019m leaving the original edit though so it makes sense",

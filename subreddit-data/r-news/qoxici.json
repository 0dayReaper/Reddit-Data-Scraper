To me, while apathetic, it doesn't sound malicious as much as it sounds like the trolley problem. It's cold, callous and definitely unprofessional the way I've worded this but oh well. I wouldn't say this deserves a \"Wholesome\" award although maybe the patient inside the ambulance would disagree. Nonetheless, thank you kind stranger for the award.",

He drove up and down South Beach in a rented (insert ridiculously expensive car here) to be seen and photographed. While doing so, he hit another car. Because of course. He immediately had a member of his crew get in \"his\" car to handle the consequences while he jumped in the SUV and had the driver speed away.

He needs to go to jail for this as he actively promotes the behavior that caused this and then failed to respond accordingly when these dangerous conditions arose. He literally performed for 45 extra minutes after these events were brought to light and even finished with a firework show. My god I'm so digusted.",

There was plenty of security and officers on deck, but they cannot control that many people, when he purposefully asks them to rage and continues the performance. Any respectable entertainer would not continue the show. He knew people were getting hurt as he saw the ambulance, this message of \u201cnot knowing\u201d is a lie. 8 lives lost!?!? And hundreds injured? For all the money and fame he has, he needs to be sued for this. What people fail to understand is - you\u2019re famous BECAUSE of your fans. There are plenty of talented people who are not famous. So when you willingly let your fans die, you should no longer get to be rich and famous.",

You can stand in front of your own seat or gtfo. Same with Times Square for NYE. They have all the areas sectioned off by barricades with people sequestered into smaller groups. \n\nThis is the reason they act like that. Crowd control is massively important when you have this many people. All it takes is one person tripping and falling to start a wave of panic that causes people to push forward and people die.",

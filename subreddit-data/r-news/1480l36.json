The swelling was the first big red flag. Complained of head aches for month or two. The nurse took her blood pressure 3 times and each time was like 170/ 100. They kept her. Dosed her up with magnesium. Manually dilated her over 3 days. Our baby was born healthy and screaming none the less. We took her home at less than 4.5 lbs. At first I thought my wife  had gained some weight through the pregnancy. Nothing crazy. But she dropped 15-20 lbs in water weight 3 days after birth. Ladies. If you think you\u2019re developing preeclampsia, and your doctor isn\u2019t listening. Tell another doctor, nurse, patient advocacy. Get some one to listen and change the thought process.\n\nRIP to this lady giving birth to her child.",

They had me on a BP cuff that took readings every ten minutes. BP was so high it set off an alarm with every reading. After an hour of high readings they told me I was going back for a C-section immediately and that if I wanted to call my fiance to be there for me he'd better hurry because it was happening fast. It took him maybe a half hour to get down to the hospital, at which point I was already in the operating room and getting the anesthesia injected into my spine and then getting prepped for the surgery. \n\nMy blood pressure actually stayed high for two days after the birth too.

Not to scare yourself even more, but so you know what to watch for. You being there to advocate for her needs should be a big help.

I have never known anyone who has had a female relative die in childbirth, not ever. And in 42 years I have only known of two stillborn children- one was a friend of my mothers in the early 1980\u2019s who had twins and one was stillborn; the other was in the mid 2000s when a forty year old woman having her first pregnancy was on a remote property, went into labor at eight months, and the baby got stuck and suffocated before the flying doctors service arrived. \n\nIt\u2019s so rare in Australia that quite often deaths of mothers in childbirth are reported on national news. It\u2019s seen as a shocking, completely avoidable tragedy that simply should not happen in my country.",

Even the first podunk hospital she went to just curiously noticed that she had high blood pressure, protein in her urine, and that the baby\u2019s vitals weren\u2019t good.  They drew the stupidest conclusions known to man, while my sister continued to swell up like Aunt Marge in Harry Potter. Meanwhile, we are all freaking out (in another state) because it\u2019s so damn clear she has preeclampsia! Days later she was transferred to another hospital who IMMEDIATELY recognized what was happening and she went straight from the ambulance into surgery. We are so grateful that her and my niece survived.",

I witnessed a woman die (although she was resuscitated and survived another few days before being declared brain dead) because her chronically negligent doctor and lazy nurse didn\u2019t recognize and treat her severe preeclampsia until she seized (in another dept she was turfed to). They didn\u2019t WANT to recognize it b/c they were both too lazy to treat it. Her BP had been high and previous prenatal visits, her presentation was CLASSIC, and her 28 week baby was severely growth restricted which also indicates that the onset was not sudden. Baby was BADLY damaged by her mother\u2019s perimortem C-section, but survived at least awhile, I saw her in the NICU much later: no gag reflex, nystagmus, BAD. \n\nI wasn\u2019t involved in her care except to take the phone from her lazy nurse and tell the doc that no, she can NOT be sent to the ER for r/o gallbladder, he could order a GI consult to be done on the unit, per policy. I didn\u2019t know any of her symptoms or vitals, just was clarifying policy b/c I overheard her nurse (who was WAY more experienced than I was, just newer to that unit). Which meant he would have to come in. Which he didn\u2019t want to do b:c LAZY and maybe also drunk. Then I went back to the care of my patients and didn\u2019t hear any more about it until she came through the doors of the unit in full arrest, CPR in progress. \n\nAfter helping get her into the OR and delivered, I went to the triage room she had been in hours earlier. Her lazy POS nurse said \u201cher blood pressure was normal!\u201d  No blood pressures had been taken during that time. None. I confirmed the time on the monitor was correct. Nurse lazy killer claimed to have taken it with a manual cuff, but she was unable to say where she got it, where she put it after using it, or what color it was (b/c she was lying). She also claimed reflexes were normal and clonus was negative, but could not correctly demonstrate how to check for either. She didn\u2019t even understand the difference. \n\nI wrote an incident report on what I knew. I always thought I\u2019d be deposed one day as a witness. It\u2019s been over 20 years and nothing. I\u2019ve never found any evidence online of a lawsuit. Doctor, nurse, and hospital all slime balls. \n\nI had a later case with that same POS doc with a severely preeclamptic mom. When I called him to report all her symptoms, I had already spoken to the head of OB and obtained and implemented orders, and anesthesia and head of OB were en route to do a C/S. Drunk doc wanted to order labs and wait for results. When I told him what had already been done, he asked why I called the head of OB. I told him \u201cHV\u201d (initials of mom who died, no more than a couple months prior). He said, \u201cwho is that?\u201d  I told him. He hung up. Came in, but head of OB had already done the C/S. \n\nAnyway, docs and nurses can be negligent (although MUCH harder now due to protocols and standards and automatic order sets in EMR systems). But, eclampsia can also be sudden, severe, and atypical. \n\nI have spent almost 30 years as a nurse trying to protect moms and babies from preeclampsia. Care has gotten better and more standardized, but AFAIK, rates haven\u2019t decreased and moms and babies still die and get seriously injured.",

I still ended up with preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome (my kidneys were starting to shut down and my liver took some damage). I also developed pulmonary oedema and had a hard time breathing comfortably. It easily could have been fatal. \n\nThe thing is, these symptoms happened seemingly overnight. One day I was fine, the next I wasn't. I did have pregnancy related hypertension and I was being watched for that. I went in for two NSTs and did two 24 hour urine tests. One of which was just a week before I developed preeclampsia. All of my tests were good. I had zero symptoms. Even when I went in for an induction (I was 40 weeks and had just started having symptoms two days prior, so my doctor wanted me induced out of precaution) I still felt fine. When the nurse told me my kidneys and liver were suffering, I still didn't feel anything. The one and only concerning symptoms I ever had was I had an episode where my vision suddenly got blurry, and that's when my doctor went ahead and scheduled the induction.\n\nAnyway, point is, yes I understand women get ignored a lot by the medical industry. Especially women of color. BUT... People also underestimate how dangerous pregnancy can be. You can go from \"fine\" to dead before you even know what's going on.",

It has been known for 2500 years, and comes from the Greek word for lightening due to its speed of presentation. Seizure and bleeds on the brain occur frequently with this (though thankfully eclampsia is rare). Symptoms and clinical signs do not always occur with it, and so occasionally someone will just present with a seizure.\n\n\n Harder still is that we have set parametres for what constitutes a high heart rate/blood pressure. I will bet money that as an olympic athlete, her physiology was vastly different to you and I regarding her heart rate and blood pressure making it harder to catch for concerning rises in these at routine checks. This can be seen with normal resting heart rates between 60-100 beats a minute, and some athletes of which a heart rate of 40 is normal.",

I received a blood transfusion in labor and it\u2019s a good thing because I hemorrhaged and gave it all back. If it weren\u2019t for the highly skilled staff who knew how to work quickly to stop my bleeding, my kid wouldn\u2019t have a mom. \n\nI also was horrendously sick and was accused of not wanting my baby enough (seriously, a doctor said that) or of having an eating disorder or some other form of pregnancy related hysteria. I was hospitalized over and over for debilitating sickness, extreme weight loss, dehydration, etc. As soon as the placenta was out, I was better. But sure, it was all in my mind\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m a white lady and often felt like nobody would listen to me. I can\u2019t even imagine the frustration of non-white women who get treated even worse. \n\nA year ago I lost a sweet friend to childbirth. She was airlifted to another hospital in an attempt to save her and she died during the flight. My soul aches to think of her husband who didn\u2019t get to be with her as she passed and who is now raising a daughter on his own. I wish she were still here, enjoying the rollercoaster of parenthood. It\u2019s surreal that she\u2019s gone and I\u2019m so angry for her daughter. What a horrific burden to carry. \n\nBirth is natural and generally safe but when something goes wrong, you often only have moments to take action. Add to that being a non-white woman and you have an incredibly dangerous situation.\n\nEditing to add: thanks for the award!

He's not exactly intelligent, and has made a lot of irrational decisions in this case. Even if the judgement is low, there's a good chance he was cheap with his insurance policy, such that it won't cover everything. And if the judgement is high (tens of millions), his insurance probably won't cover that much.",

To lose a child and then be attacked hounded by people calling you a liar is one of the most deplorable social attacks I can ever imagine someone perpetrating on another person. \n\nHow dare Alex Jones and anyone that ate up his lies about these people. They are just as despicable as he is for their actions. Absolute sub humans bottom feeding off of their cesspool of an \u201cagenda\u201d.  Justice is sweet when it shows up at the right time.",

She was the mother of an exgirlfriend.\n\nAfter the shooting the press was hounding for an interview. Eventually her and her dad did a single interview with CNN.\n\nAfterwards several websites sprung up claiming she was a paid actress. They broke down the interview almost frame by frame. They claimed the tears were fake, that she was to calm, that the man next to her wasn't her father because they looked nothing alike.\n\nIt was horrible. It would have been inexcusable in any situation where a person's mother died, but to go after after such a violent murder.\n\nI really lost a lot of my faith in humanity. It was inhumane. A five minute internet search would have proved everything but those monsters didn't care. I believe at least some of them knew they were making shit up, it was truly horrible.\n\nI wish Alex Jones was going to prison, that way people without money might think twice before doing the same.",

It should set an example like when hate groups have had to turn over property that then was used to the exact opposite purpose that the group stood for in the first place. \n\nMake him regret every lie told for clicks, every attack on a dead child's memory for a few pennies, and try to show all these other bad faith actors who call themselves the \"News\" that this behavior of making up unsubstantiated, outlandish claims and further ruining the lives of people who have lost everything will not be tolerated in our society.",

Sometimes people teased him. Other times, people prised him out of the lamppost and ordered him to fill in the holes he'd drilled. \n\nThen, suddenly, Percy Postfucker had access to dozens - even hundreds! - of people who *also* think lampposts are *just so fucking sexy*. Gradually, he got more and more comfortable with his identity as a Lampie. They spoke regularly, exchanged pictures, argued about whether the new A-L-111 is *really* more of a cocktease than the JP-180 with reinforced bindings. \n\nSuddenly, Percy is part of a community. Hey, he thinks. This is *normal!* I'm gonna be **Proud** Percy Postfucker, and fuck anyone who thinks otherwise!\n\nAnd thus, that person who would otherwise have just been pressured by reality (or bullied) into keeping the fuck quiet about his weird shit has a whole group of friends into the same things, each convincing the next that *actually*, a lot more people want to slip into the convex cradling slot of a J-90a than admit it. In fact, they say, **we're** the normal ones, because *obviously* everyone else wants to molest street furniture, but at least we're *open* about it.\n\nThus the internet has succeeded spectacularly in something that specialist magazines tried for decades to do - allowing groups of weird bastards and conspiracy nuts to congregate more easily, reinforcing and developing their beliefs. Mostly harmless, of course, but sometimes to dangerous and unchecked levels.",

I can see Jones doing the same thing\u2014not taking the judgments seriously, blowing them off, and then when the sheriff comes a calling, stashes some money away and then declares bankruptcy.

They go into it can be charged faster than a normal battery but didn't go into that much more, or they did and I just didn't understand. Seems like a good idea for wearable electronic devices but then the article said it can only give EV a small boost of power for acceleration and hill climbing. Seems like you can go days to weeks without having to charge your device but it's not the game changer for electric vehicles one would hope for. \n\nSorry, that's the best I got.",

Capacitors store charge between two plates separated by a gap (it can be air, but more commonly filled with a dielectric medium which massively boosts their charge capacity by being poor conductors but very permeable by electric fields), while batteries use chemical reactions to store charge.\n\nThe fact that batteries rely on chemical reactions means that charging and discharging for them is a relatively slow process, while the fact that capacitors just use plates and gaps means they can charge and discharge very fast.\n\nBatteries have a higher energy density than standard capacitors, and their controlled discharge cycle means they can measure that energy out at a predicted rate over a long period.\n\nSupercapacitors, however, have significantly increased capacity for holding charge - though they produce less voltage as a result.\n\nThey can also discharge in a fraction of the time of a battery, meaning they can deliver instantaneous power as needed at extraordinary volumes\n\nSupercapacitors won\u2019t replace batteries, as the ability to have slow discharge over long time periods is really very useful, and batteries do that exceptionally well.\n\nBut Supercapacitors do absolutely have a role to fill - to expand power delivery for short term high demand",

If you\u2019re doing something that needs higher engine power, a supercapacitor could dump charge into the engine.",

I\u2019m married with kids, but still continue to learn more and more about female\u2019s issues with their reproductive systems. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve always felt that it was none of my business. I\u2019ve always been in the mindset that these are issues that are between a woman and her doctor and no one else should be involved. \n\nI have to wonder, if more men understood all the issues women deal with in regards to reproductive issues, would more men be pro-choice or at least stop trying to make decisions about women\u2019s bodies\u2026 which is another way of saying pro-choice. \n\nI think sometimes the term pro choice polarizes people and people feel that being pro-choice is the same thing as being pro abortion. I have my own personal opinions about abortion and I never really considered myself to be pro choice until someone pointed out that the fact that I keep my opinions about abortion to myself and don\u2019t think I have any place telling a woman what she can/can\u2019t/should/shouldn\u2019t do with regard to their body makes me pro choice. \n\nIt\u2019s such an insane time we\u2019re living in and I really feel for women right now, and I hate to think what the future may bring.",

Here is a [map](https://reproductiverights.org/maps/what-if-roe-fell/) from the Center for Reproductive Rights showing the protection status of states currently for abortions.  If they also have expanded access. States that are hostile towards abortion and states that have no protections in place. \n\n2nd Edit: So here is a [list](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/abortion-stands-state-state-state-breakdown-abortion-laws/story?id=85390463)  updated as of an hour ago that shows the laws in each state for anyone interested in travel or relocation. I encourage you to look up your states constitutional laws regarding abortion. I'm doing my best to find multiple sources outlining the constitutional amendments made for states as people suggest them but information may be missed. Here's the states that have a law protecting abortion access outright or at least to 15 weeks at this time. This is not a list of states that it is legal, just ones with protections in place currently. There are other states that it is legal but is not protected as of yet. I'm not including the ones that allow it to 6 weeks because as any person that has ever been pregnant knows, you rarely know before 5 weeks and 1 week isn't enough time to obtain an appointment:\n\nAlaska, Arizona (this one is iffy), California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas (subject to change), Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington\n\n(Let me know if I missed any that actually have a law protecting access currently and were not included on this updated list) \n\nr/auntienetwork is a great resource for helping to obtain services and even travel, housing, etc. I have been told by commenters \n\nOriginal Post: For anyone looking to move or that need to take a \"vacation\", here's some great states to go to:  Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, ~~Iowa~~(nvmd, Iowa is no good), Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nThese states all have laws protecting abortion access.\n\n1st edit: Based on comments, some of these states listed may not be viable choices. In that case, come to Maryland. We've just passed more laws in Maryland to protect access. Insurance or Medicaid must fully cover abortions with no cost sharing. Trained medical providers can provide abortion services and not only obgyns. \n\nOh and thanks to whomever sent the passive aggressive \"reddit cares\" message. Appreciate you!",

That doesn't sound he is ready yet to be released despite that he thinks he is fine.\n\nConsidering he is fighting the 2022 decision that he isn't ready to be back with society yet it is likely best that he is kept somewhere safe into they are more confident that he won't go off his medication and hurt more people.",

Not give you a shot and then if you happen to kill even more people THEN you can have a real life sentence in prison. I feel that if the thing you do when you have a mental break is murder as many people as possible then, mental health be damned, you belong in prison with someone monitoring your psychological well-being.",

More severe punishment actually creates a greater risk of reoffending,\"\n\nI dont want people who do things like this locked up to punish them. I want them locked up so the rest of us aren't in danger from them. \n\nThese issues seem to be divided into 2 sides: the side that wants the offender to be successfully rehabilitated &amp; be given his freedom &amp; the other side where anyone who opposes this is accused of just wanting them to  suffer in some sort of misguided revenge fantasy. \n\nI dont want the rest of their lives to be miserable. I also don't want them to kill anyone else. I distrust parole boards, as from what I've seen they have no accountability &amp; have made fatal errors in the past.  \n\nI'm sure when people like this are released they do well at first. They take their meds, have support, attend their meetings, whatever. When these systems break down is when trouble starts: they go off their meds, miss meetings with an already overloaded probation system, etc, etc. \n\nIf you don't know you need help, you're not going to ask for it. Until these support systems are MUCH more rigorous I'd rather not take the risk of releasing someone who's already killed 5 people.",

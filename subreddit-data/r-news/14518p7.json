I was watching this documentary on youtube that claimed when California opened it's license program, they didn't limit the amount of licenses issued, which lead to everyone and their cousin growing marijuana. Some unholy amount (140 thousand tons IIRC) sat with no buyer because America simply cannot consume marijuana at the sheer volume of it's current production. I think this is a case of US grower cutting their rate and offloading vast warehoused of their produce overseas, supressing the Thai market and hitting thier economy. \n\nAmerican marijuana are doing to Thailand what American clothing \"donations\" and rice \"assistance\" did to the African textile economy and Haitian agriculture/nutrition.",

Like a few others said, it's about playing to your environments strengths.  If you're in a cold climate, bam you're set but high thc, but you can grow in any climate. Not only that, but can make high thc in any climate. Just gotta know what to do, and then pay and work to do it. \n\nIt's not the hardest work but it's not braindead. You have to know some stuff to grow well, im lucky enough to be the third generation taught how to grow so I have a treasure trove of knowledge you won't get from books. But I just meant to say all of this as to mean, anyone can grow high thc stuff, it's possible for anyone, they just gotta have the right tools and apply themselves at the right times",

A few years ago there was not much demand for it and it was incredibly pricey. \n\nPlus as much as Thailand has a rep for the place for the backpackers to go have a smoke, it was unfounded for a lot of Thailand (you really could only easily get it and smoke it openly in some places like the islands). The penalty a few years back for being caught with a joint in Bangkok was a lot harsher than being caught with one in a UK city.",

However, it's easy to produce quality good enough to justify growing personal amounts, you just need patience. \n\nThe process to make oils, rosin, and other products is a bit more technical, but with the internet being what it is, there really isn't a bottleneck on information to do it. Cheap rosin presses can be had for under a grand, and making oil/butter is fairly easy, just a lot of steps. \n\nI will concede that making pharma grade bud isn't going to be attainable by your average joe gardener, but who really aims for that high of a bar when growing weed for personal use?",

This has led to illegal purchases by minors, poorly zoned pop up shops, and zero accountability.\n\n2. There was minimal imvestment by the Thai government to fund growing in the country. While this could have greatly benefitted farmers in a country with huge income inequality, most simply do not have the capital for high quality grow operations.  Most of those reaping profits are the ultra wealthy lawmakers who voted for legalization.\n\nI'm happy I can smoke legally, but there was very little forethought into regulation and investment. Doesn't help that the police in my area had the market cornered on weed sales pre-legalization.",

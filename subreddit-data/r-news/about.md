Description:

The place for news articles about current events in the United States and the rest of the world. Discuss it all here.

Rules:

Submissions must be articles about a specific news event: A story that is over a week old, does not properly report a story, or is not noteworthy, or is not in English. Self-posts and meta-posts without moderator approval (live update threads, major breaking news, and megathreads are usually exempt) are not allowed. Articles must be about a specific news event.

No opinion/analysis or advocacy pieces: Opinion and analysis should go in /r/Foodforthought or another relevant subreddit. This includes articles with editorial opinion, personal conjecture, or otherwise. Press releases with an editorial slant, and analysis of news events (rather than reporting on the event itself) are not allowed. Both articles and domains regarding advocacy for a certain point of view or ideology rather than objective reporting should be reviewed under this rule.

Articles must not be primarily concerning politics: Articles must not be primarily concerning politics. To meet our requirements, a definitive outcome needs to have been reached. Political posturing, such as a politician making remarks, are not allowed. Political procedure, such as a bill being introduced for legislative review, are not allowed. A piece of legislation being signed into law or the results of an election being finalized are both examples of definitive outcomes which would be permitted.

No editorialized titles; Title must match article title: Editorialized titles, written by the posting user or the domain, are not allowed. Titles should be unbiased and strictly factual. When the article itself is titled appropriately, the submission title should be directly sourced from either the title OR lede of the linked article, but not both.

Don't plug other subreddits in the title; adding cross-post references is not suitable for /r/news.

No paywalls/blogspam that steals content: Domains which require the user to purchase a subscription or register an account in order to read the full article are not allowed in /r/news. All users should be able to access the article. Domains which are stealing or reposting content from other news sites, or simply rehash another article without adding substance, are not allowed, and users are encouraged to post the original source instead.

No posts covering an already submitted story: This rule is in relation to already submitted stories which are being rehashed on multiple domains. If a popular story is being submitted while the same event is covered in another post on the front page, or one with sufficient upvotes at an earlier date, it may be subject to removal. If a story was already submitted but did not become popular, then the rule is not applicable. Spamming a story until it reaches the front page is in violation of reddit's sitewide rules and is not allowed.

Do not be racist, sexist, vitriolic, or overly crude: Comments containing racist, sexist or bigoted slurs are subject to removal. Comments which promote racism, sexism or bigotry (including a viewpoint in relation to those) are subject to removal, and users whom engage in posting such comments may be banned at the mods' discretion. Overly crude comments which add nothing to discussion are also subject to removal/ban. These include inappropriate or inflammatory comments, personal attacks, etc.

Do not be unnecessarily rude or provocative: In conjunction with vitriolic and crude comments, a comment that is unnecessarily rude (inflammatory comments, personal attacks) or purposefully provocative (baiting) are subject to removal/ban.

Advocating for or celebrating the death of another human being is grounds for a permanent ban from r/news. Regardless of what you think about a person, this type of discourse is unwelcome on r/news and we will not hesitate to remove you for it.

No cheap or distracting jokes or memes: Jokes, memes, puns, and overall low quality comments are subject to removal, especially in the top-level comments.

No witchhunting. Follow the Reddit Content Policy.: Any thread which violates reddit's site-wide rules or invokes a witch-hunt is not allowed in /r/news.

Contact information publicly advertised by the person or organization in question is allowed so long as it is not being used to incite personal harassment, and doesn't contain personal contact information (home phone number, information of non-public family members, etc.) **To ensure that such comments aren't removed, provide a link to the official page where this information is contained.**

Do not advocate or celebrate death: While civil criticism of others is allowed (whether living or deceased), advocating or celebrating the death of others, including public figures, is not.

No bots/Novelty accounts: Bots and novelty accounts are not allowed

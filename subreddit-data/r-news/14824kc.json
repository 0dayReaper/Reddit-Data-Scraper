            "comment": "&gt;The American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM), along with 27 co-signers, distributed an open letter recently saying that \"recent and ongoing litigation may have an enormous negative impact on the medical care of competitive and elite athletes.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The letter comes on the heels of several significant legal cases, including one where former NFL player Chris Maragos was awarded $43.5 million by a Philadelphia jury after accusing his surgeon and the group that oversaw his rehabilitation of malpractice for their decisions related to a meniscal tear. He contended in court that the case cost him at least $8.7 million in future NFL earnings, but was awarded five times that in damages.\n\nOne of the issues mentioned was the qualification of \"expert witnesses\".  What wasn't mentioned was the qualification of juries to understand the issues and the witnesses.\n\nIn the Maragos case, it was shocking he got any kind of settlement.  A pro-athelte, particularly in NFL, with ongoing knee issues.  There's no magic to fix a worn out knee and Maragos was 10 years into it at NFL level.",

Or their teams can.\n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? Determine that regular people are too stupid to understand things and overturn the entire legal system?",

A jury could have a decent understanding of the issues that would arise in court. But as we get more advanced, it is impossible to for the average layman to understand the entire breadth of knowledge that would be required to have a similar grasp on the issues that arise in modern court cases.",

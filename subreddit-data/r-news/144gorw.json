Canada offered to send firefighters to help, but there was no legal framework to allow that to happen at the time.  Since then, Australia, Mexico, and New Zealand have all joined or signed their own agreements. Looks like France has done the same, but it's been years since I fought fires, and I guess some things have changed.\n\nThe problem with early fires like this is that a lot of wildland firefighters are seasonal temp hires, and are only now coming on as they finish the school year or take leaves from their off-season jobs.  So a lot of stations at the federal level are short staffed or not even open yet.",

It seemed to be a move by conservatives to cut spending if I recall correctly. Just looking for some info on that so I can hate conservatives just a little more. Not saying that would have prevented polluting the us east coast air at all, but they wouldn't be struggling so much to address it.",

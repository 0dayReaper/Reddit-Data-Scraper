Suburbs are the most inefficient way to run city services to people because you have to build infrastructure over farther and farther distances with a low concentration of taxpayers to pay for it. If people live closer together, it is far less expensive per capita to provide not only housing, but also to provide those mental health services and drug treatment within a close enough distance to be effective. That's why people in the USA pay so much in taxes and get so little for it in terms of services.",

We just can't all have a front/backyard which honestly would be fine if there are green spaces nearby. We'd be able to walk more, bike more.  Have third spaces where people can have a sense of community again.  We'd drastically cut our infrastructure costs for roads/bridges because we wouldn't need nearly as many.  We'd probably be healthier cause we're more active.  More people would be able to afford housing and homelessness could be significantl reduced.  \n\nIt's so frustrating seeing places like Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia routingly rank higher in things like happiness and life expectancy. For us to know exactly what things they're doing to get these higher rankings. For us have the technical ability and resources to mirror those things. Yet we just refuse to do so because of greed.  \n\nI live in the suburbs now because my wife and I were essentially forced out of the city but I'd love to be able to live in a quality, more dense neighborhood where walking/biking were 90% of my transit.  But in the US those neighborhoods are at a premium and are unaffordable for all but the wealthiest folks.",

The solution to a housing shortage is obviously to build more housing, especially in the form of denser development instead of insisting that every person buy or rent a 4 bedroom house that they can't afford or be kicked to the curb.\n\nYes, \"the government\" on multiple levels can intervene to resolve this issue. The easiest would be for the local government to zone more areas for mixed use or multi family homes, ideally located within walking distance of public transportation. That wouldn't require federal intervention, and it wouldn't need the approval of some batshit crazy republican from Florida in Congress.\n\nVote in your local elections. Vote for city councillors, mayors, state representatives, and governors who are willing to oppose NIMBYism and build more housing. Vote for pro transit politicians who are willing to break the automobile monopoly on commuting. If you have time, show up in city meetings and tell them that enough is enough, and housing needs to be built.",

Some places offer a monthly rate but most don't so to live in an RV park full time you would pay 1200 bucks a month on top of your insurance and maintenance and you'll most likely have a loan for the RV. Legally city ordinance prevents you from parking in any of the myriad of completely empty lots and cops will come to displace you after three days, so there's no boondocking in city limits. BLM land is at least an hour away from the edge of town so your commute to work immediately turns to shit if you do that.\n\nPoint being, fees suck. Free parking would be *dope*",

They had a lot of rules that I imagine restricted a lot of people from entering (no record of violence, no drug use, the enter/exit times were strictly enforced) and it was mostly meant as a transitional program while you found more permanent housing.\n\nCan't say how well that would go down in LA (this was in SD county), but it's better than the current method of shrugging shoulders at the problem.",

We need more housing where people want to live. That means smaller sq foot, higher density urban/suburban infill. That means people going back to traditional housing models from before the 1950s, which had a lot more multi generational living and roommates/house sharing.  \n\nBut building codes favor single family home construction. So that means urban sprawl on and on, and it's not profitable to build smaller sq. footage homes.  So they keep building McMansions that are 1+ hour commutes from cities. \n\nI would happily ban corporations from owning anything zoned single family residential. I think if it's zoned that way it should be owned by a US Citizen, period. But that wouldn't magically fix rental costs.",

Some things, like conveying, will be way overbuilt and expensive to maintain without substantial retrofit. Other things, like waste and vent stacks, are way under-built and require coring of slabs that is expensive if it\u2019s feasible at all. Still other things, like HVAC, are entirely different systems; you can\u2019t serve apartments with VAV boxes. Floor to floor heights are way too tall; curtain walls don\u2019t have operable lites; fire ratings change from B to R-2 occupancies. There are a million little details that make adaptive reuse quite challenging.\n\nBarring significant subsidy, it\u2019s often cheaper to demolish and rebuild. Of course, if you want to just replace the office tower with a residential tower, you have to go through the entire entitlements process, even if you\u2019re not adding bulk and density.\n\nMy two cents; there is a lot of vacant land suitable for infill. With prices for residential over $1,000/sf there is plenty of economic incentives for high rise infill. We just have to wrangle control of entitlements from the NIMBYs.",

The problem with that though, is that trailer homes in SoCal near the coast are running just shy of permanent home prices.  Once you factor that the interest rates are higher and loan terms are shorter, trailers can cost more per month.  Then you add on the park fees...\n\nThe cause is that mobile home users out here are able to sell their \"location\" without selling the property.  So someone can drop over $400k for a trailer, and the park owner can still tell them to take their $50-$100k trailer and leave.  We need to decouple the value of mobile homes from where they are currently located, and not allow park owners to charge crazy lot acquisition fees.",

Often they themselves are the perpetrators as this is an opportunity for them, in a closed room, to talk to teen girls about their sexual habits including masturbation.\n\nWomen/girls being interrogated about these things are part of Mormon church culture. It\u2019s not voluntary unless you want to invite questions as to why you\u2019re not participating like everyone else.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to me that these untrained lay \u201cclergy\u201d can find out this shit and then tuck it away.",

I was in for my \u201cbirthday interview\u201d (easier to keep track of the yearly interviews if you do it around birthdays) and confessed what has happened. \n\nA common trope in Mormon church is that a parent would rather their daughter die than be raped. I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around that it would have been preferable, spiritually , that I die than what I had experienced. I needed help and guidance.\n\nHe asked me to go into details. More detailed follow up questions. He wanted me to walk him through it step by step, literally watching me relive it in front of him. I can\u2019t remember if he took notes, but I do remember he kept a pen in hand. Maybe he did. \n\nI was told to repent. I was shamed. I was disciplined at home. I wasn\u2019t allowed to attend school because he was there. I couldn\u2019t stay home either because they didn\u2019t trust me so I had to tag along with an older sibling as they went to a community college and I sat in the back.\n\nNo one told me it wasn\u2019t my fault. No one even told me I was a victim. No one asked.\n\nThat bishop, an unpaid and untrained after-school tutoring business owner, likely called that hotline if he was suspicious of whether what I said constituted a crime, and was reassured by a lawyer that he did the right thing.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one, and my story is among the BEST case scenarios.",

Yeah training can make a difference there ... what is appropriate, what isn't? What reason is there not to lay out guidelines of appropriate behavior for these men as the churches representatives? All they get is a couple paragraphs in a handbook.\n\nAsking \"do you obey the law of chastity\" (the actual question the church asks them to ask) is very different than asking \"do you masturbate? How often? How do you do it? Tell me details.\" which these untrained clergy sometimes do. They should be trained not to.

A lawsuit filed by child sex abuse victims accuses the church, widely known as the Mormon church, two of its bishops, and other church members of conspiracy and negligence in not reporting church member Paul Adams for abusing his older daughter as early as 2010. This negligence, the lawsuit argues, allowed Adams to continuing abusing the girl for as many as seven years, a time in which he also abused the girl\u2019s infant sister.\n\nLynne Cadigan, an attorney for the Adams children who filed the lawsuit, criticized the court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this ruling expands the clergy privilege beyond what the legislature intended by allowing churches to conceal crimes against children,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement, the church concurred with the court\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints agrees with the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s decision,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the abuse these children suffered. The Church has no tolerance of abuse of any kind.\u201d",

This a guide, written by church lawyers, to protect the church from possible liability. In a third of the US, and likely in other countries where they operate, they don't have these clergy protections by the state. In a lot of those jurisdictions, clergy and other church people who work with children are mandatory reporters- they are required by law to report suspected child abuse. It's a business, which makes a lot of profit, and this handbook is just like the handbook at your job. It's not representative of the business' beliefs or values.",

The appropriate authorities investigate the \"hearsay\", and that is the accepted evidence, in addition to victim testimony. However, we permit clergy to be exempt, in 33 states, because of some archaic notion that it's religious privilege. \n\nWe also often overlook that this was a confession of being an abuser, which is a hearsay exception in most states. Meaning that admitting to a third-party that one has committed a crime is admissable as evidence, even though it's \"hearsay\".",

A defendants out of court statements are nearly always admissible to prove the truth of the statement under this exception. It's the same way a cop is allowed to testify that a person confessed in an interview. It's the same thing: an out of court statement being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted.",

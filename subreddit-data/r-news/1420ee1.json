If they commit *new* crimes when the turn 18 or older, then those will be adjudicated by the adult courts. But crimes committed before 18, and things like probation violations and whatnot that go along with them, are still heard by the Juvenile courts. And they can request or be ordered to serve that time in Juvenile detention rather than adult jails.",

Speaking as someone who worked in that field for about six years, there are a number of violent offenders (A-E felonies) and repeat serious offenders (F-I felonies) for whom community-based services simply do not work. Some of our best rehabilitation work in North Carolina happens in those Youth Development Centers; in the specific facility that I worked in for three of those years, there was one psychiatrist, two or three psychologists, four social workers, and eight case managers and twelvedirect care staff for a maximum of 24 juveniles. \n\nDo they work perfectly? No. Does the system fail sometimes? Yes; I will always remember the three kids I worked with that thought the system truly failed. But the literal thousand other kids that I worked with during that time period benefitted from the services we provided. Did they all stop committing crime? No, but I think we definitely lowered recidivism (which the research shows) and lowered the (juvenile) violent and serious crime rates in our state.",

Now you have a new child recruited into a gang to replace this one, who has a sentence and is locked up. They have limited job prospects, housing prospects, and education prospects and will be subject to the nearly 3,000 collateral consequences of conviction. They become trapped in the cycle of poverty, crime, and gang activity. It\u2019s all they\u2019ve known and adult jail is no place to rehabilitate an adult, let alone a young adult or juvenile. Lack of healthy food, outdoor air, education, counseling, and family - for one. Access to gang members, sexual assault, drugs, fighting rings, abuse from COs, and learning the culture - for two. \n\nI\u2019m not saying let them back out to do it again. Vote for evidence-based policies that defer a conviction until after the child/young adult has demonstrated growth and commitment /with resource access/. A social worker, a therapist, enough food in the house, maybe the abusive parent is gone, who knows. \n\nBut to punish a child for being the victim of a predator \u2014 that older gang member. This is equivalent to when we sentence teen girls for prostitution. Yes, they\u2019re making choices. But no, we shouldn\u2019t throw the book at them because a person who grew up in a healthy environment would probably not be selling their body - that may be a wrong statement in today\u2019s positive culture re: sex work as applied to adults so not a straight 1:1 analogy but I think it still works here. A healthy child who grew up in a healthy environment would not be out shooting people bc of road rage, etc. \n\nI know that when we have an opinion and someone reasons with us and has data and facts, we dig in. So you prob won\u2019t change your opinion on this, but. The world needs more empathy and understanding so maybe this will spark more person-centered thinking in someone else reading along.",

Often times those circumstances do not amount to self-defense but the victim murders their abuser. Emotionally that is a difficult situation to parse through. Would you still put person in prison forever with no hope of rehabilitation?\n\nAlso, does it matter to you that persons convicted of homicide have a [recidivism rate of 2% for recommitting a homicide](https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/a-new-lease-on-life/) whereas other offenders such as property crimes or sex offenders have higher recidivism rates for the the crime they were convicted or a similar crime?

I don't think that it over all brings some good, I think that the longer convicts stay in prison, the larger of a burden they become on society once they are released. Therefore it is not illogical to draw the conclusion that it would be an improvement to do nothing.\n\nUsing water to douse the flames on a fire would be good, but if that option is not under consideration, than at least stop pouring fuel on the flames is an improvement. It has nothing to do with the perfection/imperfection, that's something that you're injecting into the argument, not me.",

If we want to complete the Venn diagram then we would include 'do nothing' as well.\n\nBut my critique was about the use of the word *\"despite\"* in the title, implying that things would somehow be better if the 18yr old severed a longer time in prison. I don't think that's the case, I think that given how the US prison system work, prison time is negatively correlated with 'betterment of society'.\n\nIf you agree with me on that point (which it seems you don't?) then the three alternatives that exist are the three I listed, out of which I massively support radical prison reforms, because the remaining two are clearly preposterous.",

Stay on topic, and the topic here is about whether your comment meant \"if it's not perfect then don't use it.\" \n\nYou said if there isn't going to be a prison reform then either kill the convicts right away, or don't send them to prison. Either way the prisons aren't used in your two choices. So yes, you are saying that until the prisons are fixed then don't use them and you have two options of how not to use them(killing the convicts or letting them go free).\n\nYou can't hide behind there being three options when you yourself gave two options, you cut out the third option yourself in your original comment. With that said my comment about \"if it's not perfect don't use it\" stands because the third option is a hypothetical change is laws which even you yourself said was unlikely to happen. Even if that change did happen, my comment would still stand because until it does happen you've only left two options, both of which don't use the prison system.\n\nFurther don't accuse people of not wanting prison reform, I never said that or expressed it and for you to try and say you agree with prison reform but I don't only makes you look like you are trying to take the moral high ground because you lost the logical one.",

I didn't say that. I'm saying that if the currently system is actively detrimental and confers a net negative to society, which I think it does, then reform it or don't use it.\n\nThis isn't about whether or not I think prison reforms will make the US prison system 'perfect', the argument I'm making is whether or not the current prison system is better than *nothing*. I think that the current prison system is *worse* than nothing for prisoners that you plan to let out into society again.\n\nAn analogy would be to drink poison. **I view prison time in the current US system as drinking poison**. I'm saying that drinking nothing is better than drinking poison, and your counter-argument is essentially *\"Hey why do you knock poison, just because it isn't perfect? Just because poison isn't perfect we should do nothing?\"* And my response is that it isn't poison's lack of perfection that's an issue here, but the fact that it's a net negative and it would simply better to drink nothing at all, if you refuse to drink normal clean water (which would be analogous to prison reforms in this scenario).",

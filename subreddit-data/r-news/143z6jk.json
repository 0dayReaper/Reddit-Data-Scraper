The show South Park asked permission from the former owners to use their business as a premise and location for an episode of South Park and they reluctantly said yes. The owners went on to say that every time the episode aired their business reliably increased 50% the following weekend.\n\nThe story about this remodel is actually super interesting, and Matt and Trey literally spent 4X what they planned on saving this landmark of many a childhood including mine. I took my stepson here some years ago and it was sad to see its condition then, but they've completely rebuilt this place. They're awesome.",

                            "comment": "There was a crazy bit of info about the cliff diving in [this NYT piece I read yesterday](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/us/casa-bonita-restaurant.html):\n\n&gt;\tOther features, like the old cliff-diving pool, were actual physical hazards. It turned out that divers, once they leaped into the pool, could only exit through a 30-inch-wide underwater tunnel brimming with pipes, Mr. Shoemaker said. Then they emerged from the water into an electrical room.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cThere were 200 amps of power directly to the left,\u201d Mr. Shoemaker said. \u201cWhen I saw it, I called Matt and told him, \u2018This is the most dangerous room I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019\u201d\n\n&gt;\t(They have heard no reports of injuries.) The renovated pool, 14 feet deep, resembles the old one but provides the divers with a wider, relocated exit, among other changes.",

Come to find out the cave we went into was home to a huge Moray eel that was 6-7 feet long and he was really not happy to see us. Turns out you can fit two people through the cave entrance if you're in a hurry!",

I try to take care of myself. I quit smoking last week.\u2019 Then he looked at the bottle of beer he was holding and said, \u2018But this I just can\u2019t quit.\u2019 He was smiling when he said it \u2013 but it was a sad sort of smile.\u201d\n\nTipsy, not falling down Mel.\n\nLater that night though ...\n\n&gt;By 2:15 the Oscar-winning actor and director had been pulled over \u2013 with a bottle of tequila within reach \u2013 going 87 mph in a 45-mph zone on a coastal highway. A belligerent Gibson (whose blood-alcohol level was found to be .12, 50 percent over the legal limit) threatened L.A. County sheriff\u2019s deputy James Mee, and launched into a bizarre tirade. \u201cF\u2014\u2014 Jews,\u201d Gibson told Mee, *who is Jewish*. \u201cThe Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.\n\nHe said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d\n\nI was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",

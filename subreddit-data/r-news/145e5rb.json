The most common and very effective strategy of the far right is to flood an opponent with lies and, most importantly, *repeat and repeat* these lies. It was really noticeable with Trump, DeSantis, Jones and Carlson - they all repeat the focus words of their blathering *dozens of times* in a single speech.\n\nTake the foghorns out and the strategy collapses. A majority of the people actually will moderate out once they don't get force-fed bullshit alllll the time.\n\nAnd deplatforming - no matter if it's subreddits, Telegram channels, TV stations or Facebook groups - also *massively* reduces their reach. Basically, only a small hardcore population will make the jump to whatever followup channel... three or four rounds of shedding and suddenly they're at 1-5% of what they started with. Fucker Carlson reached dozens of millions of people, now it's single-digit millions at best. It also significantly slows down the speed at which the bullshit propagates in a population, as it now has to make by word of mouth from one layer to the next.",

What? \n\nLawyers as a whole have always been ridiculed and disrespected since the beginning of the profession because of the nature of their business. Some lawyers are tasked, by their own choice or not, with defending the indefensible. Look all the way back to founding father, president, and attorney John Adams who took up the defense of the British soldiers who committed the Boston Massacre. He was ridiculed and disrespected for his position that even those men deserved legal council (note: Adams successfully got six of the nine men acquitted). My point being is that lawyers have always had to bear the brunt of their profession and defend those the rest of us see as not worthy of a defense and it's nothing new.",

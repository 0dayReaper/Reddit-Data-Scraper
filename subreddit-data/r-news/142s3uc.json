It's becoming increasingly easy to understand how poorly Subway franchisees tend to perform, and how little corporate support they get.\n\nSubway used to be a good low entry barrier franchise for unsophisticated investors. But now that the risks are becoming more public it's a much harder sell.",

So the only real way to make money is to cut costs to the bone. Like there is a reason why every Subway you\u2019ve ever been in had a dirty floor that looks like it hasn\u2019t been cleaned in weeks or longer. This creates a vicious cycle where the brand is incentivizing behaviour that hurts the way consumers perceive them.",

Parking is a premium, and the other businesses really don't attract customers there. The one I frequent most,  has 4 businesses in it: a tobacco shop, a Little Ceasars, a payday loan business,  and a Subway. Meanwhile, across the street is a strip mall that has plenty of parking, and traffic. At one end, it has a large church, in the middle it has a grocery store, and in between, a few small businesses. Yes, it even has a couple outbuildings. One has a Tacp Bell, the other is a Long John Silver's. It would see a decent increase on foot traffic and a lot more parking.",

I think it's a fine print thing, somewhere on the coupons and in the commercials it says \"participating locations only\" in 1-point font, and even though an individual store's address is printed right there on the coupon, they can claim not to be a participating location.

Their boon is the calories. Subway got so big due to weight loss. Hell, I believe Subway was founded by health advocates to be an alternative, no? (I might be misremembering on this part)\n\nTheir whole campaign should be \"Look at this turkey and cheese sandwich! 280 calories! Less than half of a Big Mac!\". Plain and simple. Just let people know they can eat healthy on long trips and away from home. You can have your bigger items like meatballs subs that don't fit this route, but overall that should have always stayed their advertising. Americans are obsessed with weight loss. It works.\n\nInstead they've gone such a weird fucking route trying to paint their food as good when it's just not good. And introducing weird shit like the crab meat (it's not real crab. Spoiler. It's imitation with a huge tub of mayo), or their \"avacado\" which is basically just brown fake guac.\n\nI'll put it this way though. I really don't like McDonald's, at all. But I'd eat McDonald's over Subway any day of the year. Subway should focus on being a weight loss path, even if Jared turned out to be a horrible person. \n\nJust get a professional trainer to gain 100 lbs, then have them lose it and say Subway did it. Someone who is extremely vetted and decidedly not a pedophile.\n\nBut the fact that this simple route is so hard for them says that they have bigger issues. People aren't picking Subway because it's their favorite food. Their picking it because it's seen as \"the good healthier route\" for most.",

I managed a store for almost 2 years and learned a lot about the trajectory of Subway and what worked and didn't work for its customer base.\n\nSubways customer base is people looking for deals. It's claim to fame wasn't Jared, it was the $5 Footlong. Subway was known in households for discounted food, more bang for your buck and the bonus part was that it had the appeal of being healthy. Subway thrives on coupons and stores that don't accept them, suffer. But Subway can't keep franchisees when they rape them from any possible profit by forcing their coupons down their throats, forcing promotions, and then taking the biggest cut of sales than any other franchise does, 12-14% depending on what you opt in/out of. Thats 12-14% of your sales at the register that they're taking, before you even pay anything else and look to see what kind of profit your store will be making.\n\nSubway tried the health appeal with its wraps, protein bowls, and salads. It's main traffic driver is the coupons though.",

All that makes them unattractive for big investors. Subway will have to cut way back on the number of locations and update the remainder.

Now subways always feel empty and veggies don\u2019t feel fresh, so it\u2019s a negative feedback loop that leads to even fewer customers.",

            "comment": "This franchise needs to be done and over with. I was one of those who started scratch. Bought an old Quiznos location in an extremely high foot traffic area in a very busy city. As the article says, most franchisees are family run and that\u2019s exactly what we were, my parents worked hard cutting and prepping the veggies and washing everything while me and my brother worked the front baking and making sandwiches. My sister would occasionally help if she was done with her classes. 17 hour days average for six years. Monthly site inspections from corporate. What the article doesn\u2019t tell you is that once you open one store up, the Development Agents try and get you to open another one up a block or two away. They\u2019ll show you graphs, foot traffic studies, other development possibilities, all that jazz. But if you refuse, them fuckers will threaten they\u2019ll give the location to someone else. As a franchisee putting in the work, it makes no sense because your same customers will go to the other location and you\u2019ll lose out on the already small margin you may have. However the DA (Development Agents) and Corporate get their 12.5% (probably more now) cut every week, auto deposited from your sales. And depending on how many locations you\u2019ve got, it\u2019s that same amount across the board per store. Sure it all evens out, but you\u2019re also paying rent in two different spots compared to one of you don\u2019t own the building, you\u2019ve got twice as many employees, your overhead is doubled, as is your waste. Oh my god the waste!! Each store on average is \u201csupposed\u201d to be throwing away at least 100-150 loaves of bread along with various other items that were deemed not fresh enough. It was. \n\nWe sold it back in 2017 after two years of trying to sell it. Because we were a top performing store, Developers were not too keen to see us leave the market and give controls of that location to someone new. Two years of dozens of potential buyers coming in and meetings and applications and developers would reject so many of them. Some of them backed out because of Jared; others backed out because they assumed an a danger owner would suffice. Majority of them wanted to convert it into something else, but Subway doesn\u2019t allow that. They actually negotiate the rent and terms on your behalf to the landlord or building owner. So for those that did want to confuse the brand and expand, developed rejected their application. Yes, we could not sell until the DA allowed us too. So ours was locked in for a 5-5-5 at 5%. Meaning every five years, the rent increased by 5%. Even if we left, Subway would still have that location for the remainder of the lease, with the franchisee responsible for all payments and taxes. \n\nAlso you\u2019re only allowed to buy from a very large food distributor like Sysco or Reinhardt. Contract pricing you know. Depending on whatever that market area negotiates, the price is the price. All branded items like paper products and some frozen items were Subway branded but others like veggies and cheeses had fluctuating prices. The soup is the same shit from Panera, and the cookies are Otis. And the quality was so bad that you had to assume you\u2019ll be throwing away half the sack of onions and/or a couple boxes of tomatoes. All that waste is at the franchisees expense, ZERO help or deductions from corporate. \n\nI can go on for hours. It was definitely a low-cost in, and they did sell you on studies and how much your store could be making. But they exaggerate an insane amount. Our was supposed to be taking in around 9-11K/week, we were averaging maybe 6-800 a day, pre Jared-yoga mat-11 inch footlong-gate. After, it dropped to 4-600 a day and that\u2019s with couponing, BOGO, and crazy sales, none that was helped in any way by headquarters to relieve some of the expenses incurred by each franchisee. Sure you can opt out of not participating, but then you may lose\nThat customer forever, and those DA\u2019s will happily open up another shop a block away. \n\nThey did give us the tools to succeed, but they rigged the game to always be the winner without putting in any effort. The only thing I carried with me in my other ventures is Thru-put and FIFO. The guy that bought from us still owes us a lot of money, and he\u2019s been dodging payments. I guess the question is do we take that store back and deal with the BS all over again, or just watch it fall. \n\nDon\u2019t eat the tuna.",

We hung up and the creative director looked at the rest of the team and said, \"That went well!\" That was actually a GOOD phone call from one of their \"nicer\" clients.\n\n\nTo make it even better the client gave the entire team refillable Subway gift cards for the entire team at the holidays. The next day a couple of art directors went to use them, only to discover they were empty! \"Oh, I gave those to you so you could put money in them and use them whenever you wanted to go to Subway!\" Lady, we already have credit and debit cards.\n\n\nI could share more about how corporate ruined the chain over the long term by destroying the franchise marketing efforts, but I'm pretty sure there are plenty of articles that have been published about that.

It\u2019s dead on with what John Oliver covered on his Subway episode.\n\nNot to mention if you are a franchise owner and you own only one shop, you basically have to work 7 days a week from open to close to turn a small meager profit. Hire few employees or make it a family run to keep costs down. My friend estimated depending on location one shop might net you $100k/yr after you paid out the expensive fees and such. But keep in mind that\u2019s 7days of work for a year. It\u2019s only when you own 3-4 shops before you have \u201cgood\u201d money rolling in.",

No spinach wraps anymore, no list of cheeses, toppings, sauces, etc so that tells me they want to nix customizing to your liking. Our wraps measured 6.5 inches each and they charged full footlong prices. No thanks. We won\u2019t be back. Bewildered, while eating are extremely mediocre wraps, we wondered out loud how much longer they\u2019ll last. Remember $5 footlongs???",

Maxwell had the status and connections but the family no longer had significant wealth. So they were two peas in a pod. \n\nThe impression I have on all this is that the US and Israeli governments know or knew a lot of what was going on here and were either involved or turned a blind eye. That's why the story got killed off years ago and only got a second wind because of the outrage following the Miami Herald's reporting on this. \n\nAnd I feel Epstein only lived as long as he did because he used the kompromat he collected to ensure his safety. They all knew he was a paedophile but he had material on people who did not want to be embarrased and who had the means to make anything go away. And I feel Maxwell may have supplied Israel with this material also which was why she arranged the girls and has been given such a head start to tie up loose ends and get the story straight.",

It's an ivy league prep school\n\nOn top of that Epstein taught there at a time where Donald Barr was clamping down on things like dress code and the length of guys hair and culture wars in general. Epstein had the look of a rebellious student with long hair and shirts with a few buttons undone. Epstein was 21 years old and DID NOT have a college degree. How does a guy like that get hired? Can't speak to others who worked there but nothing adds up",

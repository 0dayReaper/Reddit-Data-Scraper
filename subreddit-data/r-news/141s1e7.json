There\u2019s probably going to be a very high human cost to these chemicals and for these companies to just \u201cpay a fine\u201d is kinda unconscionable.

E I DuPont was a student of LaVoisier, who figured out chemistry. They pretty much own the state of delaware.\nBy WWI they were already known as the merchants of death. That was before they put lead in gas and lead in paint. Then they invented nylon and kevlar and teflon. The stuff in this lawsuit is a byproduct of teflon. They also put the hole in the ozone layer.\nChemours was spun off recently. I suspect it was supposed to be the fall guy for this litigation. Corteva is the result of a merger between DuPont and Dow Chemical.\n\nMy father worked for DuPont before he died of cancer.\n\nThere's a recent movie, Dark Waters, starring Mark Ruffalo as the lawyer who broke the case. I recommend it highly, although I'm not objective. trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAOuhyunhY",

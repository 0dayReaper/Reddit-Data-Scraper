The partially declassified report is dated January 2022. Its author was redacted, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to a request for comment on the authors. \n\nUnchecked overreliance on commercially available information poses a threat to Americans, the report found.\n\nCommercially purchased data \u201ccan reveal sensitive and intimate information about the personal attributes, private behavior, social connections, and speech of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt can be misused to pry into private lives, ruin reputations, and cause emotional distress and threaten the safety of individuals.

Big data has become astronomical. And now AI will revolutionize it very quickly.\n\nAt least in the US we have civil rights and protections over how evidence can be used in court. But expecting the federal government to stay in the 1990s is just never going to happen.\n\nTheir buying data on Amercians from private companies is absolutely expected in my mind. If anything, it's comforting, because it means they didn't get it on their own.",

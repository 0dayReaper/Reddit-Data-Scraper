Lots of chemicals have been in our food, paint, textiles, building materials, fuels, etc that are later proven to be quite toxic; so \"no proof yet\" in no way means \"necessarily safe\". Since Sucralose is potentially genotoxic at an unsafe threshold at normal consumption levels, and has been associated with gut permeability issues in other studies, it is absurd to mock people who choose not to consume it. Like really, you're going to mock someone who makes a personal health choice (or support OP who does) as simple as avoiding this chemical??\n\nFrom the study:\n&gt;\u201cTo put this in context, the European Food Safety Authority has a threshold of toxicological concern for all genotoxic substances of 0.15 micrograms per person per day,\u201d Dr. Schiffman said. \u201cOur work suggests that the trace amounts of sucralose-6-acetate in a single, daily sucralose-sweetened drink exceed that threshold, and that\u2019s not even accounting for the amount of sucralose-6-acetate produced as metabolites after people consume sucralose.\u201d",

You also have to consider what sugar substitutes bring to the table specifically for that purpose: as consumed as a \\*substitute\\* for something that we \\*know\\* is bad for people, which is added sugar. If people feel compelled to avoid artificial sweeteners \\*and\\* avoid as much added sugar as possible, more power to them if they want to be excessively careful, but if they're choosing to go from sucralose back to sugar it could very well end up being worse for them. Finally, I'm forgetting the specific examples, but European authorities have been known from time to time to go overboard on safety thresholds -- but I'm not an expert on European safety thresholds.",

The effects of taurine on the aging process have never been tested in humans.\n\nThe science behind this article is real, and the science is also way too premature for this much hype. \n\nWhat's happened is researchers have gotten promising results testing taurine on mice and monkeys. Most medical research that shows promising results at that early stage of medical research don't actually work out in humans. Scientists do early work on all kinds of areas because they don't know which prospect will work out. What taurine needs is clinical trials, and clinical trials on humans normally go through three separate stages. The editor would have been wiser to hold off on running this piece until further research is completed, and then gone to print only if those future experiments show equally promising results.\n\nEither a journalist and an editor didn't understand the science adequately, or they did understand it and they ran with the piece anyway for cheap page views.\n\n(Guardian is a reputable publication on many topics but their medical journalism often lags behind other subjects).\n\nPieces like this mislead the public into thinking scientists are incompetent--when instead the reporting is shaky.",

If someone doesn't already have that background, what they see is the hopeful headline, paragraphs of technobabble, and then a prediction from a scientist at prestigious Columbia University that, \"At the end of the day, these findings should be relevant to humans.\u201d\n\nThat piece later cites that same researcher's findings, \"Yadav and his team analysed medical data from 12,000 Europeans aged 60 and over. Those with higher taurine levels had less obesity, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, and lower levels of inflammation.\"\n\nYet what Guardian doesn't do is clarify the methodological weaknesses of retrospective population studies. The soaring optimism might be brought down to earth with a sober explanation of how uncontrolled variables can skew population study findings, or by interviewing another specialist or two in the field who have critical appraisals of this research. \n\nNormally, interviewing both sides of a legitimate debate is best practice in journalism.

There are other sources if sugar and caffeine that aren't as much of a perfect storm to wreck your system. (Two sources spread out over time would do alot less damage than the one source all at once).\n\nBut yeah energy drinks both pull the water from your bloodstream (the sugar causes this cause water follows solutes) while increasing blood volume making your body think it needs to dump water to fix this, then the caffeine comes in and constricts your blood vessels which ends up making the above problem worse.\n\nEnergy drinks are kind of ok from time to time but if you drink them regularly it may be healthier to swap to black/reasonably sweetened filtered coffee and a separate source of sugar",

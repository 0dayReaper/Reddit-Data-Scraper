Although in some instances, the accident happens in such a way that not even a helmet will save a person. I recall that the veteran model Lauren Hutton nearly lost her life in a bad motorcycle crash near Las Vegas. She originally was not going to wear a leather jacket but was talked into it. Hutton said she was glad she did as the leather prevented her skin from getting ripped to shreds as she was dragged across some gravelly terrain in the course of the accident.",

The other was when a passenger hit me in the head wypith a full water bottle. It was hard enough to cause that flash to black in my vision and momentary confusion about what the fuck was happening..  I had to quickly steer off of the road to avoid rear ending a stopped bike in both instances. \n\n\nIf I were one of those people that freeze under pressure, they'd probably would have died.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, even in my car, I am always watching my rear when I am stopped. It saved me once. I was at a stop in traffic that was built up behind a school bus. I was watching my rear view mirror and an SUV was flying up behind me. I pulled into the tree lawn next to me, and the SUV ran up the ass of the van that was in front of me. I don't think anyone was injured seriously, but that was with over an extra car length to stop. The suv was totaled and the van would need its backend rebuilt at least.\n\n\n\nI also sat with a dude at lunch my senior year because he was new and sitting by himself until I moved. He messed up and hit an old bridge support that was out of commission but never removed. I heard his guts were spread out around him.  A girl with him survived, but was hospitalized for months.",

You have to be accurately assessing the driving of every car you come across, checking their mirrors to see if they are making eye contact with you, to make sure they have seen you. \nRiding a bike is actually one of the most rewarding things you can do on the road as it demands not only 100% concentration on the road, but you being aware of your entire surroundings the whole time, including all cars. If you are watching a driver in front of you, you can actually guess what they\u2019re are going to do ahead of time. Most drivers are that transparent. \nBut it requires you to be focussed. \nSo, if you\u2019ve actually wanted a bike but zone out while driving, it\u2019s not for you. \nIf you relish the challenge of working out what a driver will do when even they probably don\u2019t know, there\u2019s nothing like it on the road.",

I fulfilled my requirement for my degree by doing stagecraft, makeup, and sound design. I refused to play any part of his hacked-up mess.\n\nHe threatened my degree. I threatened to take it to the Dean of Students AND report him to Samuel French, the company that supplies scripts, as he had not just changed a line here and there, he changed things wholesale, violating the dramatic intent of the original author in multiple places.\n\nThe idiot made Claude a _hippie!_ He was one of two characters who was NOT a hippie. The other was the girl Claude saw in the park riding a horse and got a crush on. The idiot made HER a member of the hippie group, but not a hippie. She was a beloved rich white girl. So of course he assigned HER the song sung by Hud's wife. There wasn't even a reason she sung it, she just did, or of nowhere. The rest of the cast and crew figured he was sleeping with her.",

A bumble bee hit me so hard I thought I got shot.\" She said \"i love you but this isn't going to turn out well.\" \n\nFor my graduation they were debating getting me a Harley.

It being their fault doesn't somehow negate you riding a machine near purpose made to kill you in an accident.\n\nPer mile driven, you're 24x as likely to die in a motorcycle as you are in a car.\n\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/road-safety/motorcycles",

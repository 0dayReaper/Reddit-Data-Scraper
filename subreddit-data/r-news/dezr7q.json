Corporations, especially the bigger they get, are only about making money for their shareholders and executives, period. There is no national pride/loyalty, no moral concerns, no ethical lines that can't be crossed in the name of chasing infinite growth and short-term profit. A corporation is NOT a person; they don't have a sense of morality or a conscience. They are a legal entity created to make business safer/more efficient. A company doesn't have \"values\". The people running it might, but the company doesn't. If there are no regulations against something, or if the penalties for breaking those regulations are minor enough, then anything can and will be done for that sweet sweet money.",

Then when it had a few episodes left, it was suddenly removed from all Chinese streaming services and only accessible outside of China. The two main actors became really close friends while filming, but they were banned from ever appearing together on screen again, and it even got to the point where they had to travel outside of China if they even wanted to hang out together. I couldn't believe it when I first heard about it.",

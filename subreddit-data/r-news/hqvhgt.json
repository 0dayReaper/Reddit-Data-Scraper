Was a really late night, we were both working on our bots in the pits at Battlebots '99. That industry was being decimated by CG at the time, he and a few others there convinced me to tough it out and get my degree. We competed together a bunch and crossed paths over the years since. Kind and smart dude, inspired me and countless others in science and engineering. RIP... Lost one of the good ones...",

I had gotten lucky and gotten to VEX worlds my first year of middle school which was the last year it was in Dallas. This was before the HS MS split in competition so we were really just there along for the ride. Grant was one of the speakers at the event and I ran into him in the halls on the last day. The guy talked to this 12 year old kid who was absolutely starstruck for like 20 minutes about robotics and engineering and even helped me figure out some things I was having trouble with on the robot. Before he left he joked that he expected us to be on the finalists stage in a few years (just to be nice to the little middle school team I'm sure) and fuck did that light a fire under me. I never made it there because turns out I cant actually build a robot worth a damn but here I am bawling while trying to write code at a autonomous driving company.\n\nThe man was so genuine... fuck man, the guy deserved a long time.",

[@grantimahara](https://twitter.com/grantimahara?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1282887830478262272%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fentertainment-arts-53401026) is one of the brightest. Not an ounce of malice within that soul. Intelligence and heart that eclipse so much shadow. His years of friendship are precious to so many.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He would drop anything and everything to help a friend, including our engagement. He put charity and community work as a priority in so many projects. He was an inspiration in so many ways, and I'm going to miss that joyful laugh so much. The silliness and adventure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He was passionate about making tomorrow a little better, in ways big and small. In being a mentor and entertainer, to make others smile with his gifts. His generosity was unrivaled. There are too many stories. Too many wonderful memories. We miss you, bud. &lt;3",

She acts in the way she's told.\n\nThough she does have a funny story about a gig she did for a GTA (I think?) game where she was doing the voice of one of the prostitutes making sex moans. And at some point she realized she was kind of over doing that sort of work, so she played it really deadpan and uninterested. Apparently the directors thought it was hilarious and kept it in.",

Its ruined us financially and now I'm a caretaker for her and my mother who's also survived a stroke 22 years ago. Im the one that's diabetic, high blood pressure, and multiple physical injuries. I'm a time bomb. The virus is stressing me out as well. At least I'm doing my part taking my medications. Staying healthy, and keeping my weight at normal levels.\n\nThank you everyone for the kind words and award. I dont want to take anything away from Grants passing by any means. I really just wanted to give a different perspective of an aneurysm survivor and family. There's nothing good about it either way. My Wife is still alive and we'll celebrate 35 years of marriage this year. Thanks again everyone and God Bless Grant and his family.",

Fortunately you are correct and getting scanned occasionally is a very good plan. If detected before bursting, which usually happens quite a while after the bulge appears, they can be treated quite easily. Obviously it's still brain surgery, but on the scale of scary brain surgeries it's about a 3 and pretty close to routine these days",

It absolutely terrifies me how anyone, regardless of health, can just suffer one and that's it.\n\nHad a guy at work in his mid 30s have one, didn't kill him.  He developed split personalities, screamed at you at work one day, loved you the next.  Seemed drained constantly.  Sent us threatening text messages at 2am because I was talking to a girl at work he liked, or because X person didn't offer to get coffee when the clients arrived etc.  We're in an office, he had no personal assistant yet tried to treat us like we were all his because he was one level above us.\n\nEventually after 20+ HR complaints proving how useless HR are in companies, lawyers got involved because we couldn't let him go due to fear of being sued as he stated the aneurysms was caused by work stress (I did a job just below him, and I can tell you, it was fucking hard work and I developed soul-crushing insomnia myself which lasted circa a year).  Then he sent an email from his personal email address to the work email address of the girl I was talking to, saying he couldn't believe after all these years of working together she would betray him by not backing him up, he always loved her and wanted her, to just grab her and take her in the bathroom (classy), stuff like that.  She broke down and almost quit, saying she didn't want him in the same building any more.  She was scared now.\n\nThe lawyers took one look and went \"Yeah you can fire him now.\"\n\nAneurysms are no joke.",

I joined the company on a 1 year fixed term contract and quit at the end due to my insomnia and the stress of it all (even broke down in tears myself sat at my desk one morning just staring at the screen), and I got told about his condition a few weeks in.  When I first met him he was having an off day I guess, and in seconds I had that sinking \"Oh god, I have to work with this guy and I don't like him already\" feeling.\n\nApparently it had only recently happened, the aneurisym, a few months before I joined and he was a really great, sweet guy.

I had some serious anxiety issues in early college and was always thinking about death, whether my own or of a loved one. My good friend told me that death is going to come when it's going to and there's literally nothing I can do about it so there's absolutely no point in worrying. That sounds like an awful thing to say right? Except its the absolute truth of the matter and the more you think about it, the more it puts you at ease in life. There's no point in worrying about it at all because worrying will not help in any way and only makes you miserable. You can take precaution without worrying so that's a given of course, dont be reckless in life, but to fear death because it sneaks up on you will only make things worse. I think about that whenever I get it in my head that something bad will happen that's out of my control and it has honestly gotten the fear of death out of my head. I'll of course approach that gate when it opens but there's no need to stare at it from a distance.",

Thomas said Orton killed them after he received an email from Slade that she and his father wouldn't be a part of Orton's life after he turned 18, according to the station.\n\nTelling irrational teenagers \"so long get fucked never contact us again\" probably ain't the smartest thing.\n\nParenthood doesn't just end after 18 years, especially in the current economic climate.",

Not being taught right from wrong may explain that, however given how even the most negligent parents usually still find a way to teach that lesson I\u2019m hard pressed to believe that\u2019s what happened here. I\u2019m not saying it definitely didn\u2019t I\u2019d just need a lot more proof.\n\nI do agree something is up. Most parents do just cut off their kids financially AND cut off all contact, not even wanting to see their kids ever again. I mean that\u2019s a very big deal, even for shitty parents. Given the fact he then murdered them? I mean this is speculation but to me it sounds like the parents knew their son was a whack job, maybe they knew he was a psychopath. Hard to say but they gave up on him and didn\u2019t want anything to do with him for what sounds like a good reason.",

Of course it isn't an excuse but it can definitely lead to and directly cause it to occur. It is real whether you want to believe it or buy it or not. Just because your parents weren't negligent monsters doesn't mean negligent monstrous parents don't exist, and mental illness isn't something you can really understand unless you've experienced it first or second hand (or have studied it for years). Just because some parents are capable of teaching their kids empathy doesn't mean every parent has that ability and not every child has the same sanity or capacity to feel empathy as you've been blessed with. Turns out things happen whether you buy them or not! Brains are funny that way.",

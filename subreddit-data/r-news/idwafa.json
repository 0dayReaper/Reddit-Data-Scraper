He passed out and medics arrived to help him. Unfortunately it was so hot outside that him being on the hot pavement was painful so he was struggling and squirming trying to get up but the medics were like no you just blacked out and might have heat stroke you need to stay down. So they put a towel or something over him I guess to block the sun and kept him pressed on the floor. This was being filmed live on TV and his family was watching the entire time. So he mentioned how from their perspective they just saw him pass out and an ambulance arrive and throw a towel over him so his family thought he just dropped dead mid race.",

NO outside activity.  We were supposed to leave 30 minutes before dawn.\n\nWe didn't start marching until 10 because of after action meetings or something.\n\nIn my company of about 120 people, 20 of us made it back on our own two feet.  Every saline bag was used, trucks were called in from all over the place to get soldiers back to the hospital.  Even with soldiers dropping like flies, no one called a stop to the march and requested transport.\n\nPretty sure a bunch of people lost careers over that bright idea.",

British police have issues, but every use of force is investigated heavily to make sure it was necessary and the focus on de-escalation. Even if you are a callous bastard, the system should force you to meet a bare minimum. It's a problem with what the system demands and scrutinises, not officer emotionality. Met police here that are bastards, but they aren't bastards that can freely ruin my life or execute me on a whim, because the system would crucify them.",

If you instruct someone to crawl, they are going to drop to their hands and knees and begin crawling. Y'know, like babies do. \n\nBut they didn't want him to crawl. They wanted him to shuffle towards them, which you can do on your knees, but you literally cannot crawl unless your hands are on the floor as well. \n\nIf we're talking about the same video, which I think we are, they didn't shoot him because he wasn't crawling correctly or because he wasn't listening. They shot him because he reached for his pants after they kept falling down. Y'know, like literally every human being does instinctively when their pants fall down. He was drunk, instinctively reached for his pants, and that was enough for a cop to fill him with bullets. \n\nAll because he (the guy killed) got drunk with some woman and he decided to waive a BB gun around his hotel room, and someone from the street called in a potential shooter. And, once again, instead of doing any type of basic police work like, idk, verifying the information on the call or just sending an officer or two to ask the guy some questions, they sent in a team in full battle rattle like they're going to fucking Fallujah who had nothing on their mind other than \"eliminate the threat.\" \n\nFucking disgusting, this case pisses me off to no end because it was literally shit training one step after the other, and some poor guy lost his life because the police can't be bothered to treat people with any amount of decency. We, the average citizen, need to know every law and statute because \"ignorance of the law is no excuse,\" but cops get a gun and license to kill after 6 months of running around an obstacle course and being told they're the civilian equivalent of Navy SEALs or whatever fucking lie they tell themselves now.",

I don't know what's wrong with him,\" the caller says, in an audio recording of the call also released by police.\n\nFor anyone in this thread: PLEASE, before you call the cops on someone who is behaving \"erratically\" or \"suspiciously\", check to see whether your county has a mobile crisis team/mobile response team. Most of Arizona has mobile crisis response for mental health crises (and substance abuse crises etc). CRN Arizona https://www.crisisnetwork.org/about/services/ can send a team out to evaluate someone, or they can even just speak with you on the phone to tell you the best course of action, even if it is ultimately to call the police. People who are having a mental health crisis or substance abuse crisis are faaaar more likely to be killed by police (like 16x more likely), so if your area has mental health professionals on call like much of Arizona does, please utilize those resources first before you call 911. You could literally save someone's life. \n\nI'm not even trying to get into the argument of abolition or reform or anything- this is just about using the right tool for the job, and being an informed human so you can help your fellow humans better. If you're not sure about the resources in your area or you have more questions, I'm happy to look into it for you or answer what I can.\n\nEdited to add a map that has listings of some mobile crisis teams in various states/counties in the US: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/30me5/8/",

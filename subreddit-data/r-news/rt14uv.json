That was a surprise for me to see it being tackled on the golden girls. It's literally the same thing happening still which is crazy. \n\nAnyway, the golden girls should be mandatory viewing for all Americans.",

Her entertainment career was over 9 decades long, she was the first woman to produce a sitcom, and she had so many iconic roles over a lifetime that I can\u2019t even begin to summarize them here. What a life and what a legacy.",

Live with it.\u201d\n\nShe then gave him more time in the show, and was subsequently cancelled. \n\nNot many people in 1954 were doing that. \n\nShe was also well known (now) as having been a beard for several very famous (then closeted) gay men, in an effort to protect their careers. \n\nI don\u2019t often care much about celebrities passing, but this one is sad. Glad she has such a fulfilled life.",

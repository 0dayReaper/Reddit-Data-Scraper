My mom took the kitchen knife to bed with her that night and we all barely slept, specifically because we knew that if something did happen in the middle of the night, the cops weren\u2019t going to come.\n\nCops are pathetic.",

And when you take matters into your own hands, *THEN* the cops will decide to act against you as if you did something wrong. \n\nThat\u2019s why cops should HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB\n\nWithout that, in 50 years nobody will rely on or trust cops because everyone will have a story about when they were necessary, but never showed because they weren\u2019t required to. Or never pressed charged or helped because they weren\u2019t required to. \n\nThe world will be pushed further into \u201ctaking matters into your own hands\u201d and personally I\u2019m all for it after the things I\u2019ve been through. Fuck cops. Each one that let someone die because they didn\u2019t do their job, deserves to die themselves. It is their JOB. I don\u2019t give a flying fuck what the Supreme Court rules.

People who feel secure and confident don't buy as much shit. Consumption is the name of the economic game, and people who find innate value in their life experiences can't be easilly turned into a validation-seeking hungry hungry hippo.  They want us scared, insecure, and reactive, all the easier to manipulate and control. \n\nThe news should be naked information. If you wrap it in emotionally provocative dressing, it becomes propaganda. Real news doesn't lead you to what to think or feel. It just states facts. It speaks truth to power, and informs the disempowered.",

But what, exactly, is a police officer's legal obligation to protect people? Must they risk their lives in dangerous situations like the one in Uvalde?*\n\n*The answer is no.*\n\n*In the 1981 case Warren v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that police have a general \"public duty,\" but that \"no specific legal duty exists\" unless there is a special relationship between an officer and an individual, such as a person in custody.*\n\n*The U.S. Supreme Court has also ruled that police have no specific obligation to protect. In its 1989 decision in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, the justices ruled that a social services department had no duty to protect a young boy from his abusive father. In 2005'sCastle Rock v. Gonzales, a woman sued the police for failing to protect her from her husband after he violated a restraining order and abducted and killed their three children. Justices said the police had no such duty.*\n\n*Most recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that police could not be held liable for failing to protect students in the 2018 shooting that claimed 17 lives at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.*\n\nhttps://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/law-and-life/do-the-police-have-an-obligation-to-protect-you/",

A 911 center took the initial call of the break-in and misclassified it as a code 2, or a not in-progress call.  The dispatcher communicated the code 2 information they received to the officers on the street and sent 4 cars.  The police went to the door and knocked, heard nothing and got no answer.  The only knowledge they had was it was a not in progress break in.  This was before in car computers, before cell phones and in the day of analog police radios.  They operated on the knowledge they had.\n\nThe victims then called back and a different 911 call taker again fucked up, miscoded the call as a lower priority and the call held and was never dispatched.  \n\nThe government fucked up, but it occurred much further upstream at the 911 center/switchboard level.  Saying the police knew there was a break in/rape and just drove by the house without going is intellectually dishonest.  All that being said, because the dispatcher said they were sending help, gave specific instructions to remain quiet and wait I feel like it created a special relationship and a specific duty to protect.  Then that said call taker/dispatcher fucked up and didn't relay the information correctly.  Long story short, maybe it wasn't argued properly or what, but I'm somewhat surprised in this SPECIFIC case the court came to the decision it did.",

They can never be wrong, only assert themselves into the situation no matter what and make sure people know they are in control, whether they are in the wrong or not. \n\nThey wanted near absolute powers to dictate things on scene. You must obey \"lawful\" orders, but never going so far to actual define what lawful orders are. \n\nThey go on about officer safety and thats why even though in areas where it is 100% lawful to be armed, they will still pat you down and take any potential weapons you have on you even if you have done nothing wrong just for their safety \"and yours\". \n\nIn my opinion, since they so badly wanted to become another branch of the military then they get to follow the UCMJ article 99 Misbehavior towards the enemy. \n\nhttps://mymilitarylawyers.com/practice-areas/ucmj-articles/ucmj-article-99-misbehavior-before-the-enemy/\n\nIf you run away, shamefully abandon your post, willfully fail to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy, does not afford all practicable relief and assistance, then you are guilty.",

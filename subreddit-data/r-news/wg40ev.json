While federal law supersedes state law, if something falls outside federal jurisdiction, it is left solely to state law. \n\nMurder is one of those things that generally falls entirely outside federal jurisdiction (unless you happen to commit murder on federal lands). So, in order to charge someone for a federal crime related to a murder, it needs to be some federal crime. In this case, there are federal hate crime laws, and that is why those charges are being brought and not a federal murder charge.",

If shooting an unarmed civilian is a 100k payout, then it's going to have lower premiums than a 10M payout.\n\nThe second is the correlation between excessive force events.  If you can show that complaints against an officer for excessive force acts as a predictor for wrongful death, then insurance would be likely to demand insight into every civilian complaint against an officer.  \n\nHell, insurance is likely to quickly predict \"So it turns out that your officers who disproportionately pull over black people for minor infractions are more likely to use excessive force, so we're raising the premiums on them\" if such a correlation exists, and that would quickly result in police training.\n\nBut none of this applies unless the police themselves are facing the bottom line.  They won't care how high insurance premiums go if the city or county is the one paying for it.",

That was insane. You don't get to search and seizure the homes of everyone a criminal has ever known.\n\nEDIT: /u/WibbleWibbler stated that there's a rumor the officers involved were in the habit of doing these no-knocks as a means to seize all the drug money and divide it amongst themselves. If true, this would be them fishing to payouts. That would be the worst case scenario for all of their responsibilities here. That's when we'd start to bring collusion, manslaughter and everything else back up.",

They busted down the door in the middle of the night/early morning, and the couple, rightfully terrified, got their guns and came out. The cops shot them and their dog. \n\nIt turned out they had the wrong street--the right one was like a block or so away (?) and started with the same letter (like 123 Maple instead of 123 Main). And of *course* we got the usual, \"well, they had a history of drugs, blah blah\"...but it was quite clear that they'd fucked up. It was supposed to be some stash house or whatever and was just this couple and their dog.\n\nIt's terrifying to think that you could just be hanging out, watching TV, and the cops could get the wrong house/apartment and kill you on the spot. And they'd probably get away with it, and your history (such as it is) would be dragged through the mud. \"Well, she shouldn't have been sitting there like that\" or \"She had a parking ticket once, so it's OK that we blew her head off\". \n\nAt \"least\" with that guy who got shot by an off-duty cop going into the wrong apartment, it was an \"unofficial\" thing. These other ones are a supposedly trained department, paid with our tax dollars, planning these stunts and not taking basic precautions in what will *likely* involve gunfire.",

It's all just people trying to make sense of a chaotic and dangerous world in the end, I think. \"Well, yes, the cops busted in and killed the wrong person, but he did drugs once, so it's not that bad. *I* don't have drugs and *I* don't have a criminal record, so I'll be OK.\"\n\nMost of the time I see a tweet about George Floyd, someone has to go, \"Well, he had a [whatever charge he once had, years ago, which I forget]\", and it's like...SO? I don't care if George Floyd was literally the Zodiac killer. I don't care if he'd raped and murdered a dozen children and eaten their remains. And I SURE don't care if he once did drugs or some other minor thing. He was on the ground and posed NO threat. We could easily argue that he shouldn't have even been on the ground, but it sure as hell should have ended there at the very least, without the knee to the neck.\n\nI get that it's hard to catch higher level criminals and that busting in when everyone's asleep is an effective way of catching them off-guard, but honestly, I'd rather that guy goes free another day than that we risk the police getting the wrong house or ending up shooting the criminal's little kid or some other shitty thing.",

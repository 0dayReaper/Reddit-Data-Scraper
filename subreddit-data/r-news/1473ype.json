Imagine you're laying in bed asleep at 2AM and a tractor trailer smashes into your bedroom from behind you, running over you and your spouse in your bed. Of all places to be hit by a truck. The poor wife was all kinds of twisted up and didn't make it long. The house was so badly damaged that it was torn down. The lot is now a cemetery.",

A bunch of drunk party goers with an inattentive driver are least likely to follow safety rules (definitely not the passengers fault here though). I was basically the only one. It\u2019s a rural area that can get heavy fog, and cars basically fly on these roads. A potential crash definitely crossed my mind. So sad.",

She was lying down on a seat, asleep, and decapitated by the seat belt. I don\u2019t believe anyone else was belted and the injuries were severe. The driver died. The crash wasn\u2019t his fault. Don\u2019t look it up unless you want to read some horrible, detailed witness testimony by the family.\n\nIt\u2019s important for everyone to know to wear a seat belt correctly. It should be snug and low so your hips take the brunt of any collision forces. A belt will not help and may even harm a person lying back or sideways, or who has it positioned so their guts take the blow.",

I believe there is evidence to suggest that seatbelts on buses can be more harmful than the alternative.\n\nIt's possible that the seatbelts are the reason why the fatalities are so high as they may have stopped people from escaping the bus while they were dazed and ultimately led to them dying. Or the opposite is true. It's very hard to know right now.",

They are making other drugs that have higher profits because demand for them is higher. Demand is higher for a reason. Probably because people need those drugs too. \n\nFWIW, the shortage isn't due to greed. It's poor global supply chain redundancy. One plant shuts down and nothing exists to backfill demand?

While needed in many cases I think it\u2019s easier to negotiate a special deal so the government can produce it\u2019s own till there is no shortage cause besides the time and investment to set up the infrastructure to produce medicine the idea we just strip and undermine industries isn\u2019t a good look when when we aren\u2019t the ones funding all the R&amp;D into pharmaceuticals.  \n\nBesides the question of if we got the right to take the rights to something we didn\u2019t discover the idea is nice but falls flat cause it does nothing to supply based shortages. If we can\u2019t get the materials to make the medication then the idea fails. \n\nIf anything we\u2019re better off setting up production for things we\u2019ll need long term like insulin, blood pressure meds, and psych meds. Honestly the focus on cancer meds is hiding the questions being asked cause it makes any retort hard to propose cause cancer is so awful a disease.",

I've been searching desperately for another non stimulant that also helps anxiety that I can take, and it looks like guanfacine has zero interactions. \n\nSo seriously, I know this is stressful but your post may have helped me lead a better life when.

Once the machinery is used to make these drugs a large portion of it can\u2019t be used for anything else. \nAdd to the above, cancer is a highly variable disease (many types), but no one form is highly prevalent (thankfully). But that means chemo drugs for specific types of cancer are very hard to produce at economies of scale to reduce prices drastically. \nFinally, the shelf life on these drugs is shorter than most and handling requirements are much more controlled (for good reason). \n\nAll of the factors above make it difficult to get people into the business of producing them. And the price controls (price ceilings) within the inflation reduction act mean that only the biggest producers will try. And they will only go up to the point of break even, much lower than total demand at the upper ends probable demand.",

            "comment": "&gt; Islamic Relief Canada reached the out-of-court settlement earlier this month in a lawsuit against Thomas Quiggin \u2014 a former military officer turned self-described researcher who last year emerged as one of the more recognizable names in the truck convoy protests \u2014 and six others who it argued made \"false, malicious and defamatory\" statements aimed at harming the charity.\n\nIn other words, far-right-wing hatemongers engaging in racist propaganda.\n\n&gt; \"We did not exercise sufficient due diligence in researching, drafting and/or publishing the defamatory statements,\" the defendants said. \n\nBullshit.  I guarantee the \"research\" they did amounted to \"they're Muslim, they must be terrorists.  Let's find some whisper thin connection and trumpet it as damning proof\".\n\n&gt; Despite the settlement, CBC News easily located the 132-page so-called \"Quiggin Report\" online and available for download. The long, winding document packages in a pseudo-academic format **conspiratorial references to an \"Islamist cancer\" and \"globalist beliefs\"** within the federal government.\n\nSo... Islamophobic AND anti-Semitic.  Classy.  I hope the settlement bankrupted them.",

Of course, Israel intentionally engages in collective punishment\u2014e.g., destroying the homes of dead militants to also punish their families\u2014and so their stance is not surprising. Israel has also labeled a Christian charity, World Vision, that operates in the Palestinian Territories as a terrorist organization. Why Israel believes we would find their allegations credible that a Christian charity is supporting Hamas is a mystery.",

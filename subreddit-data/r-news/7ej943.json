I don\u2019t think that the Democratic Party addressed those concerns this election. Look at how Hillary ignored WI and other Midwest/rust belt states towards the end. \n\nMaybe the Democratic Party should do a better job of showing why they deserve votes, not just anti-Trump. Showing what they can do for our country. I think we lost that vision this election cycle. \n\nWhere I live, we\u2019ve always voted Democrat. My whole district, for literally decades. This year Hillary lost by 16 points. But we still elected Democrats across the state and federal level, in every other race. I just don\u2019t think Hillary represented what the Democratic Party should (and used to) stand for. \n\n\n\n",

Everything was handed to them. And they took it all: sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and they stayed loaded for 20 years and had a free ride. But now they're staring down the barrel of middle-age burnout, and they don't like it. So they've turned self-righteous. They want to make things harder on younger people. They tell 'em, abstain from sex, say no to drugs; as for the rock and roll, they sold that for television commercials a long time ago...so they could buy pasta machines and stairmasters and\u00a0soybean futures! They're cold, bloodless people. It's in their slogans, it's in their rhetoric: \"No pain, no gain.\" \"Just do it.\" \"Life is short, play hard.\" \"Shit happens, Deal with it.\" \"Get a life.\" These people went from 'do your own thing' to 'just say No'. They went from 'love is all you need' to 'whoever winds up with the most toys wins'. And they went from cocaine to Rogaine. And you know something, they're still counting grams, only now it's fat grams. And the worst of it is, the rest of us have to watch these commercials on TV for Levi's loose-fitting jeans and fat-ass Docker pants, because these degenerate yuppie Boomer cocksuckers couldn't keep their hands off the croissants and the Haagen-Dazs, and their big fat asses have spread all over and they have to wear fat-ass Docker pants. Fuck these Boomers, fuck these yuppies...and fuck everybody, now that I think of it.",

It was special to them and only to be special to them. They reaped all the benefits of a truly productive nation and now, now they don't want to foot the bill handed to them. They keep the US in a sort of stagnation that is starting to cause a regression.\n\nFor fucks sake, the president of the US vows to make America Great again by trying to ramp up coal power production. This when all other Industrialized nations are getting away from it. There was a time in America when we would have seen that China/India/Russia/Germany had built the largest most powerful Wind/Solar/Hydro powerplant and would have said: \"Hold my beer\" and made one bigger and better and not in a vain way of doing it. But in a way of saying: here is the collective way of the multitude of thinkers and builders in America making something better through the collective of different minds. \n\nMaybe I am too idealist but there is a great nation in America and sadly this ending of Net Neutrality isn't even close to that nation. So now this thursday I have to probably have a heated arguement about this with my family who was very much pro-Trump. I can hear and listen and even understand to a degree their view and position on this, but this *this* issue, I cannot tolerate an anti-Net Neutrality stance.",

If you are a nazi today, you're a bad person, and you should feel bad. \n\nIf you're trying to strip away net neutrality, you're either part of the cable companies, or you're extremely uninformed. If it's the latter, I'll try my best to inform you. I've run into some people who listen, and I've run into some people who actively try to be against what I'm saying while not understanding the situation. Every American from every tax bracket, from every race, every religion, every walk of life will be affected by this. Even if you don't use the internet, you're about to see a shift in how news is delivered to the general public. You're going to see only the news the corporations want you to see. Not just the ISPs, but any corporation with lots of money. Once the ISPs start to see their power they will start selling the rights to news. Maybe Nike is having some scandal in another country. Nike pays comcast, and suddenly all websites covering that story go away. \n\nGuns aren't the most powerful weapons in a fight. Information is. ",

So far it seems like it's just a US problem that's blowing up all over my Reddit feed.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your answers. So far the consensus is that Canadians will not be directly affected by this policy, however there are possible side effects. Here's another question: Could this mean that Canada could become a prime server hosting country in North America? As of right now, most of time I'm stuck connecting to USWest servers for most games and get upward of 60 ping.",

You're going to still have neutral ISPs and are going to be able to surf the web without your ISP throttling you or charging you more for visiting certain sites.\n\nYou are going to be indirectly affected by the pricing and throttling of sites. Sites that can't afford to pay ISPs for users to have faster access and sites that will have access prices put on them will be making less money. So if you like Netflix, for example, they are going to have less content because many Americans are going to drop Netflix rather than pay for the new $5 \"Netflix Access Package\" or whatever.",

It even gives an outline of the issue and a script you can read if you wish. You just tap the person you want to call and read the script (or use you own words!). It takes less than 5 minutes. \n\nAnother thing, I think people, including myself actually, are a little intimidated about calling. But don't worry, most of the time you won't be speaking to an actual representative. You will either be leaving a message which will be tallied by a secretary later, or speaking to a secretary. \n\n*It's easy! No more excuses! Spread the word about [5 Calls!](https://5calls.org/)*",

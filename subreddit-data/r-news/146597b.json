Especially for a group of visiting journalism students from Denmark, whose media and government at the time were in the middle of a huge cartoon crisis. We had some great debates with some of the staff at The Newseum.\n\n Such a shame they had to close it down.",

Years later, I saw in the news that the owner of that store was killed in the back of the shop when he received a package and opened it. It ended up being one of the unibomber victims. I was really sad, remembering how nice the owner was to us kids. I don\u2019t think I ever knew why he picked that shop out of all the computer stores in California.",

It's interesting that three of them were bombers.\n\nEvery day they would get their hour of outside time in the yard together, but not together together. There were 4 chainlink fenced pens on the roof, arranged 2x2, with a wide aisle down the middle that guards would.patrol. They would have conversations with each other by yelling across the aisle to each other. The only one who was uninterested in talking was Ted.",

However, she didn't keep up appointments and he left the treatment program. \n\n&gt;Kaczynski described this as a pivotal event in his life. He recalled not fitting in with the older children and being subjected to bullying. He recalled experiencing constant rejection since the age of eight. Kaczynski had a fear of people and buildings and, typical for autistic children, he\u00a0played beside other children rather than interacting with them. His mother was so worried by his poor social development that she considered entering him in a study for autistic children led by renowned psychologist\u00a0[Bruno Bettelheim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQY2oB3Rqdg)",

Ok, Damn I\u2019m reading the wiki now on the Montreal experiments and holy fuck that\u2019s just as bad. They said they were giving people mental health treatment and then tortured them. Also to the above comment, yeah not all was LSD but MK-Ultra did in fact target general population as well as military, Drs, and normal people like any of us so it did definitely fuck up normal people. Plus you don\u2019t need to use drugs to torture people so it\u2019s still extremely fucked up even on a totally sober person. They used many other drugs too including other psychedelics, stimulants, opioids, depressants, and more. However, yes it wasn\u2019t just drugging people with tons of LSD it also included ECT, sensory deprivation, verbal abuse among  other torture methods. However, I do appreciate fact checking things, that\u2019s very important so I respect highlighting that need. However, it\u2019s important to still emphasize just how cruel and horrible what they were doing was. \n\nJust some things that stick out to me about the \u2018Montreal Experiments\u2019 \n\n&gt;The procedures included psychic driving, drug-induced sleep, intensive electroconvulsive therapy, sensory deprivation and the administration of neuroleptic Thorazine\u2026often combined the sleep periods with injections of hallucinogenic drugs (e.g. LSD), as well as administration of electroshocks and the playing of pre-recorded messages into patients' ears.\n\nAlso to clarify as it\u2019s not a term that\u2019s used much anymore, but \u201cPsychic driving\u201d is basically brain washing people by playing audio clips on a steady loop repeatedly for long periods of time, often they would hear same sentence hundreds of thousands of times so it\u2019s just driving people insane. Science was super fucked up back in early and mid 20th century. \n\nWiki link for those interested to read more\u2026\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_experiments",

This lead to the point where   their HR department issued a statement advising employees not to drink the punch during a Christmas party.\n* Possibly Frank Olson, prior to his death\n\nThere's obviously more to the list and I may have gotten a few details wrong.

By September 1968, Kaczynski was appointed assistant professor, a sign that he was on track for tenure.\\[8\\] His teaching evaluations suggest he was not well-liked by his students: he seemed uncomfortable teaching, taught straight from the textbook and refused to answer questions.\\[8\\] Without any explanation, Kaczynski resigned on June 30, 1969.\\[34\\] In a 1970 letter directed to Kaczynski's thesis advisor Allen Shields, written by the chairman of the mathematics department, John W. Addison Jr, the professor referred to the resignation as \"quite out of the blue,\"\\[35\\]\\[36\\] and, markedly, added that \"Kaczynski seemed almost pathologically shy,\" and that as far as he knew Kaczynski made no close friends in the department, furthermore noting that efforts to bring him more into the 'swing of things' had failed.\\[37\\]\\[38\\]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted\\_Kaczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had won an award for his dissertation and seemed like he was a rising star in mathematics when he suddenly quit without explanation. And then he lived in his parents' house for a couple of years and then moved to a cabin in Montana that he had built, without electricity or running water.\n\nAside from that itself suggesting a nonstandard way of thinking (as well as some other things in his life), there is some question of his mental health:\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evil-deeds/200804/terrorism-resentment-and-the-unabomber](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evil-deeds/200804/terrorism-resentment-and-the-unabomber)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure how he could have been kept on \"the right path\" as he already was recognized as brilliant and had a prestigious job that he quit. It is not as if he had been rejected by society; far from it, given the accolades he had received and the career path he was on; it is that he rejected society.",

They made the pilots wear dosimeters as well, but they received an order of magnitude more radiation exposure than reactor operators did. \n\nAnyway, all radiation is not equal. Alpha radiation is mostly harmless and easy to block, but you do want to block it. Beta radiation as well, which is just electrons. It\u2019s gamma and x-ray radiation you really need to worry about, because it is \u201cionizing\u201d radiation. You also want to avoid airborn radioactive material that can embed in your lungs and do long term damage. The harmful gamma and x-ray radiation is pretty straightforward to shield and the main shielding materials are just water and polycarbonate, with some frequencies requiring relatively thin layers of lead. \n\nYes, unshielded radiation of the intensity seen inside a reactor room with a containment failure can be lethal quickly. But solar radiation is also lethal if you are exposed to it for long enough.",

Yeah...that's not how that works.  \n\nAlso, most people don't seem to realize that coal-fired power plants, when working as designed, emit significantly more radioactive particles than your average nuclear reactor.",

Because of this, you have a single fracking operation that pollutes people's literal drinking water more than this does, and residents will actually vote to still support the operation.",

If we mined every last speck of uranium ore on land, pulverized it, and dumped it directly into the ocean, the difference in radioisotope count would be barely detectable after a few years.\n\nIn fact, if we want to make nuclear power a widespread, long-term strategy for green energy generation, we will probably need to start mining uranium *out of* seawater to do it.\n\nThere is a staggering amount of water in the ocean. As long as some effort is made to sufficiently spread the nuclear waste out and not dump it all in one spot, there is a vanishingly small chance that any adverse effects will happen at all.\n\nHumans didn't invent radioactivity, and there's nothing special about nuclear waste that makes it especially poisonous at sub-homeopathic concentrations. I am infinitely more worried about contaminating the ocean with microplastics (which humans DID invent, and for which nature has no precedent) than I am about nuclear waste.",

So you'd have to develop mining technology that can survive constant temperatures in excess of 500C, then pay the energy costs of: mining so insanely deep, transporting the resulting incredibly low-yield ore over distances approaching 25km vertically, and finally processing FAR more ore than is economically viable, even if the rest of the expenses weren't in play.\n\nSo you're correct, there is more uranium deep in the Earth's crust than the ocean, but it is very, very unlikely that it will *ever* be viable to mine. Probably cheaper to mine in space than 25km beneath the surface.\n\nIf you take my original numbers as being the amount of reasonably accessible uranium in the non-oceanic crust, here are my sources for those numbers:\n\nThe World Nuclear Association estimates there are 8 million tons of \"recoverable\" (economically viable to extract) uranium on land, based on most recent mineral surveys and the current price of uranium:\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium.aspx#:~:text=Estimates%20of%20the%20amount%20available,only%20about%209.3%20million%20tonnes.\n\n\nThe American Nuclear Society estimates there are 4 billion tons of uranium in the Earth's seawater:\n https://www.ans.org/news/article-1882/nuclear-power-becomes-completely-renewable-with-extraction-of-uranium-from-seawater/\n\n4,000,000,000:8,000,000 = 500:1\n\nWe have yet to develop any terribly effective technologies to extract uranium from seawater, but it is almost certainly an easier engineering challenge than mining 25km deep into the crust for the positively horrendous \"ore\" you'd find there.",

The radiation is also in the beta spectrum, not even the highly dangerous gamma or X-ray bands.

What this means is that a gamma emitter can get to you through more things, so high-gamma fields are quite dangerous, but when it comes to ingestion or inhalation, the gamma ray can get out of you more easily than alphas or betas. \n\n[Take a look at this course from MIT](https://youtu.be/HfRpkTG7Iow), which does a decent job of explaining some of this. The rest of the course discusses this all in detail. \n\nThat said, the dilution of tritiated water to a concentration closer to that in nature makes it far less risky, so I still agree that the fear is overblown.",

One way to look at this amount of tritium is to measure the total amount of radioactivity it will emit until it is no longer radioactive, which is measured in becquerels. 1015 becquerels equal 1 petabecquerel.\n\nThe Fukushima water storage tanks contained a total of around 3.4 petabecquerels of tritium, which has at this point been reduced by about half due to the tritium's rate of radioactive decay.\n\nMeanwhile, the average radioactivity of Pacific seawater is around 14 becquerels per liter (Bq/L), almost all of which is from naturally occurring potassium-40, which has been present in the oceans since they were created. The number of liters in the Pacific Ocean is a large number with 22 digits, so the math works out to about 10 million petabecquerels in total in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSo what we're really talking about here is dumping less than 2 petabecquerels into a 10 million petabecquerel ocean.

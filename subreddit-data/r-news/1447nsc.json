Few in here will have heard of the church or the pastor. Yet they had three \"campuses\" in my city and the pastor rode a helicopter between services to get there on time. So yeah there are soooooo many of these guys that you have never heard of but hold immense sway in their little corner of \"Christendom\" (barf \ud83e\udd2e)\n\nFor anyone wondering, I went to Bethany Christian School on Louisiana, associated with Bethany World Prayer Center.

How anyone could believe he's anything but a false prophet is beyond my comprehension.

Legitimately the poster-boy for a false prophet.

And it was a slow process, but he would be significantly freed from fundamentalist indoctrination towards the end of his life. He even accepted my sister when she came out to him, shortly before he died.\n\nSo I gotta hand it to ole Pat - his disgusting racism was so obscene that he deradicalized a lifelong fundamentalist!",

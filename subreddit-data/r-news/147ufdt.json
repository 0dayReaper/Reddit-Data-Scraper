Call of Duty isn't like a life saving reality altering invention like seat belts, it's an intellectual property. I think 10 years is more than fair for competitors to develop their own IP to rival that of COD.\n\nThey've already tried with Battlefield, Sony has had exclusives such as MGS, God of War, Final Fantasy(for the most part). If we're speaking from a revenue standpoint, why should Nintendo allow Mario and Pokemon only on Nintendo? By the same logic of free platforms, they should be forced to release it on xbox and playstation. This is what I'm not understanding with claims to \"monopolies\" as it relates to COD.",

Also this is just one instance of Microsoft gobbling up studios, they have been doing it for years. Bethesda was a huge acquisition in itself.\n\nIt's foolish to think they're not going to make AB games exclusive to Xbox as soon as the 10 years are up. They want people in the Xbox/Microsoft ecosystem. Hence why Starfield and Elder Scrolls will be Xbox exclusives. When call of duty goes exclusive, Xbox sales will probably explode. Probably right in time for a new console launch. When they have a larger chunk of the market, they will get to dictate more in terms of prices and business practices.\n\nMonopoly may be used too often, but these types of sales are bad for the gaming market. It cripples innovation. I don't even play COD anymore and I think this deal does nothing but hurt gamers. Bethesda deal was the same.",

Sony is a market leader because they continue to produce incredible games that drive people to the console. Microsoft has consistently been unable to produce anything of major note for years. Xbox struggles because of shit business decisions like the Xbox One reveal. They own Arkane, id, ninja theory, Bethesda softworks, rare, mojang, etc.. and they still can't come up with games that people talk about much. HiFi rush was probably one of the most talked about Xbox games in a long time and it was a shadow release.\n\nSo now instead of focusing on quality content, they are trying to buy content that is already established to push the market in their favor.\n\nEdit: Wanted to add that Nintendo is second in the market for the same reason as Sony and they don't need to buy up giant publishing corporations.",

But you know what it does mean? *Actually leading*. Even after the acquisition, Xbox wouldn't be. So how can you justify anti-trust? The third place buying someone, resulting in them still being third, would be illegal market control, but first place buying an independent multi-plat dev is not? Bullshit.

That's silly. Game companies need first party studios so I'll never argue against that.\n\nThe difference with the Bungie acquisition is that it will forever remain an independent studio with destiny and all games going forward remaining multi platform. Xbox has not done this. Nobody would be having this argument if Microsoft indicated that COD will forever be available on all platforms.\n\nAnd with your last comment, Sony did not acquire Bungie to move the market towards the Sony ecosystem. Their true first party studios already do that for them. Also to insinuate that the acquisition of AB is comparable to Bungie is ridiculous. Zenimax is more comparable and while I didn't like the move, I didn't think it should be stopped either. \n\nThe entire collection of sold elder scrolls series games is only about 60 million where COD was at 400 million units sold in 2021. How is this comparable at all?",

            "comment": "I still legitimately do not understand how this is an antitrust issue. I get the idea of big companies merging in general is bad, and less competitors in the marketplace, but I don't buy the notion that media companies \"compete\" with each other in the same way that hardware companies do.\n\nFor example, you can easily make a case that Apple and Samsung compete with each other over who makes a better phone. The phones functionally serve the same purpose but provide different experiences to the end user, so the companies can fight for the user's money. Users typically only buy one phone so it's a big deal when a user chooses which brand to go with.\n\nHowever, media companies like game developers and streaming services do not really \"compete\" with each other when they do not offer competing products to choose from. \n\nIn the case of streaming services, users are often forced to buy more than one service because the content is segregated, so the services themselves are not comparable. They're buying access to the content, not the service itself. You can't say that Game of Thrones competes with Ozark, which also competes with &lt;insert Disney exclusive TV series&gt;, because it's not an either/or comparison. It's not uncommon for people to want to see all of them, so each company gets their pound of flesh. For streaming services to truly compete with each other, then they need to both effectively offer content parity and differentiate on price or usability of the service.\n\nSimilarly with game companies, people want to play more than one game. Microsoft doesn't compete with Activision, and Activision doesn't compete with Sony. They make complementary products. To assert otherwise just because they're fighting for limited dollars is to try to imply that Activision competes with grocery stores because you can either buy a game or you can buy food.\n\nSony and Microsoft compete with each other over their console hardware and the services bound to that hardware, such as their online services and storefront. But in that vein they also compete with the likes of Nintendo and PC. Both Sony and Microsoft seem to release their games on multiple other platforms, if not each other's. For example, almost every Microsoft game is also found on PC. Many popular Sony exclusive games are also on PC. Some are even available on Nintendo. So while I \\*somewhat\\* can see an argument about console exclusivity, it's not a strong argument because it's been the case for a long while that games are ported to PC after or concurrently with a console release. So gamers do have a choice which platform they use here.",

They had lead most of the previous generation and finished about even by the end of it. Think about it: Microsoft made the XBox into a true competitor in its SECOND generation. The defeatist attitude they drum up when discussing this acquisition isn\u2019t reflective of their history.\n\nHowever, the market share argument is undermined even further when people acknowledge Microsoft is a much larger and more profitable company than Sony (by a factor of nearly 20x). Activision-Blizzard alone is worth more than half of Sony\u2019s total value as a company.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a situation of Sony squashing smaller competitors. Microsoft is the Goliath in this story.\n\nMicrosoft has plenty of money to generate their own new and exclusive IPs without taking things everyone can play and making them exclusive. I know they are dangling a ten year multiplatform carrot, but we all know that\u2019s going away the moment that time period lapses (they also played coy about Bethesda staying multiplatform and we all know how that went).",

Nintendo was an afterthought following the successive failures of the Nintendo 64 and GameCube, but they led the console generation for quite a while when the Wii released.\n\nNintendo was again an afterthought after the Wii U released, but the Switch has returned them to leading the console race.\n\nSony had the best selling console of all time - the PS2 - and allowed Microsoft to handily beat them for most of the PS3/XBox 360 era by introducing an overly-expensive premium machine with too few games to drive sales. It wasn\u2019t until Sony adjusted later in the generation that they caught back up.\n\nAnd Microsoft, which battled Sony to a draw with the XBox 360, famously made the same mistake Sony did the generation before by introducing an overly expensive XBox 1 with few games while Sony learned and undercut them with the cheaper and equally powerful PS4.\n\nMy point is this: you are making current market share sound more meaningful than it really is. Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have all been market leaders and have all been last in the market over the past three console generations.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201cpoor Microsoft\u201d situation at all. Microsoft is last in market share (right now) because of poor choices and could be first within a generation or two without poaching a company more than half the size of the current market leader.\n\nOf course, I doubt most XBox fans would support a similar scenario in which Sony or Nintendo bought Take Two.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll edit this in: you talk about the CMA \u201ccreating\u201d a market to justify their decision, but you\u2019ve arbitrarily created and defined your own market to make your point: console gaming. To be fair, PC gaming and mobile games are enormous and control portions of the market. You could expand out to non-electronic games if you want. You could even define the market as the \u201centertainment\u201d market. Your parameters are no more valid than the CMA\u2019s.",

If anything, all you're saying is that the market share is so variable from generation to generation that even a company with a dominant market share doesn't necessarily have market control that would allow anti-trust action.

Even if they remain multiplatform for 10 years, we both know they\u2019ll be exclusive the day after that window expires.\n\nI don\u2019t imagine you would cheer if Nintendo or Sony purchased Take Two.

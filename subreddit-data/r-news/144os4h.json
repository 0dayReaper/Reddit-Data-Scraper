Our firstvwas always hsppy and making sounds and eventually singing. You'd never forget she was therd. The 2nd was always quiet as a mouse.\n\nAnd the 2nd is worse because you cannot catch up on sleeplike you can with the 1st.so after months of sleep deprivation i drove straight past daycare, literally. I didn't notice she was in the car after I'd parked and turned to get my laptop. Won't lie. That shook me. Scary as fuck. And it's not because i didn't think my daughter isn't important or that i was distracted and thinking of other things.\n\nThankfully i could simply get in and drive to the daycare again. People who say it could never happen to them probably never had to function for months on no sleep while also taking care of a toddler and a baby.",

The kids were 3 years old and I had to put them into car seats and buckle them in. One day, one car seat buckle was broken so I went to put the girl in the next one but it was also broken. So I put her in the last row, 3 rows behind the last kid. She fell asleep and I just didn\u2019t walk all the way back when I unloaded them at the camp\u2026\n\nHours later, I was called into the office and saw (presumably) her dad holding her and she was  absolutely drenched 100% in sweat. I was scared and confused and they told me I didn\u2019t take her off the bus and the bus driver saw her hours later when he went to fill up at the gas station. \n\nNo more words were exchanged and I was relieved of bus counselor duties. Years later I came across that article and read a bunch about the phenomenon but I still have guilt. Just haunts me what could have happened had she not been found when she was. \n\nNow, every school/camp/yellow bus has a sign that reads \u201cTHIS BUS HAS BEEN CHECKED FOR SLEEPING CHILDREN\u201d that the driver has to hang after each trip.",

So you would have to look there and see the baby. Sounds logical. But the problem is I have often forgotten leaving things in the stove, a password that i have set just 5 minutes back and was very confident I'd remember,. So i could very well see my kid and think I know you are there. Will be back after 1 min. Surely I will be remember you are there. And then I might forget. I can very well see how that might happen.",

The law only states you have to be \"able to drive without impediments\". So it's not strictly forbidden to drive with slippers, high heels, heavy boots, barefoot,... But if you get in an accident, and the police or judge or whoever needs to determine was at fault thinks that your choice of footwear hindered you in any way, you could be found at fault. Maybe your foot was sweaty and you slid off of the pedal, which wouldn't have happened with a normal, grippy shoesole. Maybe your high heel got stuck in the floor mat, which wouldn't have happened if you'd been driving with normal flats. I found out myself when I was younger that when I tried driving with my slippers after going to the beach, that if I pushed in my clutch all the way, my slipper could get jammed against the top, stopping the clutch from travelling back. Imagine if that happened if I was driving on the highway? \n\nHence why it's not strictly forbidden to not drive with (normal) shoes, but it's advised against.",

There's also \"paternal\" leave, which, since this year, is 20 workdays to be taken in the first 4 months after birth. The \"parental\" leave is 4 months for each parent, and can be taken in full, in 8 months of half-time, in 16 months at 1/4 time or in 40 months at I don't know. It's also possible to take it over with your employer for specific situations. \n\nAll that to say, it's good, but it could definitely be better. \n\nAnd in this case, the baby was 6 months old, so if the mother took all the maternal leave after the baby was born, she had only been going to the childcare for a month or two (father could've stayed home to for a while, maybe grandparents pitched in too). All it takes is one bad night to be in such a daze that you switch to auto-pilot and forget that your USUAL work-routine doesn't include dropping your kid off.",

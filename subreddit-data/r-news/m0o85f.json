I'm in a hot spot for stealing electricity for large marijuana grows, and so these raids happen pretty often in my city and the next one over.  I've also had a friend (who lives in a completely different state) get raided because his electricity bill was very high, so they assumed he was cooking meth or something. They raided the wrong house. \n\nAs you intimate, matters regarding electricity theft, and growing too many smelly plants, should not involve SWAT teams and live ammunition. Its almost like we've over-militarized and over-indemnified our police (aka public servants).",

Shined headlights in the house. Kept knocking on the door. At one point went to the back and tried to break in the house. Grandpa was standing behind the door with a gun because he didn't know who they were or what was going on because no one said anything. Granny was trying to call the police on the police. Finally the female cop shining her lights in the window started screaming \"Wrong house! Wrong house!\" They all bolted out and drove down the road. Turns out the neighbor a fucking mile down the road missed a court appointment. They weren't even in their jurisdiction. They went over county lines.",

I've been known to sleep through alarms. \n\nYears ago cops came beating on my door around 2:00am on a work night. My wife shook me awake and I went downstairs, threw the door open and demanded to know what the fuck their problem was. I didn't know they were cops and I was going to kick somebodies ass when I went downstairs.  \n\nAn argument ensued and it turned out somebody called 9/11 reporting domestic abuse. The cops showed up in the middle of the night to another apartment a week later. So we decided the call was probably legitimate, but they had the wrong address. \n\nI think about this a lot. I don't think my reaction was out of line, there was no reason for the cops to beat on my door in the middle of the night and one of the cops (a little runt) was way combative to start. However, I think if I'm not a 40 year old white guy when this happens I'm probably dead.",

Like all forms of talking to the police, there is no conceivable way it can help you (as it doesn't prove your truthfulness,) and a million ways it can hurt you (by tripping up your story and generating self-incriminating testimony.) Taking a polygraph is basically waiving your fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination and agreeing to a lengthy and recorded interrogation under the false premise that it can prove your sincerity (which, again, it can't.)\n\nIn court, for the subject, a polygraph is all risk and no reward.",

The basic concept is that the people running the test will catch you in the \"post-interview\": They have a guy who's \"not affiliated\" with the party who wanted the test performed run it. They run the test (which, odds are, will provide no admissible evidence), then as they're packing up, the guy will ask you questions. \"Hey, it's none of my business, but since the test is over and there's nothing to prove anymore, did you ever do anything like that? Like, I'm not asking if you killed that girl. But surely you've seen her before, right? Or surely you get angry sometimes, and maybe you've lashed out at someone when they got on your case? It's really none of my business, I just think it's crazy they're making me ask these questions, because hey, people do this kind of shit all the time, don't they? That doesn't make you a bad person.\"\n\nThen, in court, they have that guy walk in and use whatever you say against you. If you admitted that you have a temper, he says the defendant admitted he may have struck somebody in a fit of rage. If you admit that you knew the victim, he says you knew the victim, and statistically most murders are committed by people who knew the victim. If you say yeah, people get into fights all the time, he says that the defendant admitted that \\*he\\* gets into fights all of the time.\n\nWhatever you do, don't answer any questions during a lie detector test, unless it's absolutely necessary. If anyone ever implies that you don't have to answer, don't fucking answer.",

You are granted credit for 199 days already served.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2022 Pay the mandatory surcharge of $78, to be paid from prison wages.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2022 You are prohibited from possessing firearms, ammunition, or explosives for the remainder of your life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2022 Register as a predatory offender as required by law.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2022 Aggravating factors of \u201cabuse of a position of trust or authority\u201d and \u201cparticular cruelty\u201d\n\nEdit: Lots of questions about predatory offender registration. Minnesota law permits registration when convicted of a \"crime against the person.\" 2nd-degree murder is considered a crime against the person under MN law ([Sec. 243.167](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/243.167)). For those outside the US, [here's a short document](https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/ss/ssporeg.pdf) outlining the term \"predatory offender\" and its implications.",

                    "comment": "Two of those officers, Lane and Keung, were in their first week on the job. They were trained by Chauvin. While Chauvin knelt on George Floyd\u2019s neck, Lane twice suggested he roll Floyd on his side, allowing him to breath. The suggestion was not followed. In his first week on the job, Lane questioned his trainer and boss, a veteran of 19 years, in front of colleagues, about his tactics and gave an option, that if taken, would mean we know none of these people\u2019s names and George Floyd is probably still alive.\n\nCould he have done more? Could he have saved Floyd\u2019s life? Taken action instead of just speaking up? Presumably, yes. He could have physically moved Chauvin off Floyd. Zero media attention to the minor arrest in Minneapolis. Lane would have been let go or put in the perpetual shit house. There was no good way out once the knee went down.\n\nLane watched his teacher and boss murder a man he tried to save on his fourth day as a cop, but just didn\u2019t go far enough. In retrospect, I\u2019m sure he wishes what we wish we would have done if we were in that position. Done something to save George Floyd\u2019s life. But we wouldn\u2019t have done anything of the sort. None of us are tackling a cop, in the middle of an arrest, in front of three other cops. Nor did the people filming and gathered around him. They too didn\u2019t dare physically intervene. \n\nIt must have all happened so fast, the way all eight minutes and forty-six seconds do. No one, except Chauvin, felt they had the power to do anything.",

                    "comment": "He almost murdered a 14 year old boy in almost the same exact way: https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/14-year-old-boy-in-derek-chauvins-second-civil-rights-case-also-said-he-couldnt-breathe-court-records-show/\n\nHe also lied about it on his police report (as did the cop with him). The State parroted his bullshit until they watched the video and found this (video never released):\n\n&gt;   Since submitting [the previous] description to the Court . . . the State has obtained the body worn camera videos of this incident. Those videos show a far more violent and forceful treatment of this child than Chauvin describes in his report. The videos show Chauvin\u2019s use of unreasonable force towards this child and complete disdain for his well-being.\n\n&gt;    The videos show that Officers Walls and Chauvin entered the home and began speaking with the mother at approximately 8:46 p.m. The mother immediately told the officers that she wanted her children removed from the house. The officers spent the next 36 minutes talking with the mother in the living room and kitchen about the alleged incident and had her fill out a complaint form, all while the two children were in their rooms in the back of the house. After obtaining the written complaint form, Officers Walls and Chauvin proceeded down a short hallway towards the juvenile male\u2019s bedroom.\n\n&gt;    At 9:12:49, as he approached the bedroom door, Officer Walls told the child to come out of the bedroom. The child was laying on the floor looking at his cell phone. Officer Wells told the child to stand up because he was under arrest. The child responded that he was not under arrest, and added that his mother was drunk and had assaulted him. The child tried to talk with the officers about his mother. As both officers approached the child, Officer Walls said he would not tell him one more time to stand up and yelled \u201cstand up.\u201d The child said they could not touch him in his own house.\n\n&gt;    At 9:13:22, a mere 33 seconds after telling him to come out of the room, both officers grabbed the child. At that point in time, the child was backed up against his bedroom wall. Officer Walls told the child to get on his stomach, and when he did not, Chauvin hit the child with his flashlight, just eight seconds after first grabbing the child. Two seconds later, Chauvin grabbed the child\u2019s throat and hit him again in the head with his flashlight. The child cried out that they were hurting him, and to stop, and called out \u201cmom.\u201d Chauvin told Officer Walls to use his Taser on the child, but Walls did not have a Taser. At 9:14:15, Chauvin applied a neck restraint, causing the child to lose consciousness and go to the ground. Chauvin and Walls placed him in the prone position and handcuffed him behind his back while the child\u2019s mother pleaded with them not to kill her son and told her son to stop resisting.\n\n&gt;    About a minute after going to the ground, the child began repeatedly telling the officers that he could not breathe, and his mother told Chauvin to take his knee off her son. About one minute later, the child\u2019s mother pointed out that her son had said he could not breathe, and told Chauvin again to take his knee off the child as he was already handcuffed. Chauvin replied that he was a big guy and did not move. The mother asked a third time for Chauvin to take his knee off her son, and Chauvin replied that the child was breathing. The mother repeated that her son was in handcuffs, and told Chauvin a fourth time that he should take his knee off her son. The mother also said that Chauvin had hit her son with a flashlight and hurt him, and he was handcuffed now and could not do anything. But Chauvin maintained his position. Shortly thereafter, the child told his mother she should go sit on the couch, as he was alright. The mother said ok, and added that the officer had hit the child with a flashlight for no reason.\n\n&gt;    Although the child\u2019s ear was actively bleeding and he repeatedly told the officers he was in pain, the officers continued to restrain him instead of administering medical treatment. At approximately 9:21 \u2013 seven minutes after applying the neck restraint and taking the child to the ground the child asked to be placed on his back because his neck really hurt. The child then began crying. At approximately 9:22, the child again asked to be placed on his back. Chauvin asked if he would be \u201cflopping around at all,\u201d and the child responded \u201cno.\u201d Chauvin simply said \u201cbetter not.\u201d Still Chauvin maintained his knee on the child\u2019s upper back area. Another officer searched the child. At approximately 9:25, the child sobbed and coughed. He was also able to move his head from side to side, as Chauvin\u2019s knee was on his upper back area. At approximately 9:28, the child talked calmly with the officers and described where in the house they could find his shoes. Chauvin still maintained his knee on the child\u2019s upper back.\n\n&gt;    At approximately 9:29 \u2013 about 15 minutes after Chauvin first restrained the child a paramedic arrived and asked the child what happened. The child said a cop hit him with a flashlight and he \u201cblacked out for a minute.\u201d He added that he was having pain in his ear and confirmed that is where he got hit. At 9:29:47, the paramedic looked at the child\u2019s ear and said he would need stitches.\n\n &gt;   At approximately 9:31, Chauvin told the child he was under arrest for domestic assault and obstruction with force. The child asked what obstruction with force is, and Chauvin said \u201cbecause you were told you were under arrest and then this whole show in here. You don\u2019t get to do that.\u201d As Chauvin and Walls tightened the handcuffs, Chauvin removed his knee from the child\u2019s back, some 17 minutes after restraining him to the floor and kneeling on him. At approximately 9:33, Chauvin and Walls helped the child roll to one side and stand up. They then walked him to the ambulance.\n\nThis is the new trial he referenced at sentencing. I hope he gets at least another ten years and fucking rots.",

Yet we still have not accepted as a public and a justice system that police routinely lie and distort facts. The idea that police testimony is more reliable needs to be completely discarded. Police need to be assumed that they are hostile to the person and biased emotionally towards them, which they are.",

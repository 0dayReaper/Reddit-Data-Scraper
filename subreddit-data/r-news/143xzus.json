It\u2019s far from probable because the larger nations would be adverse to it due to the risk of Article 5 being invoked. Attacks on military personnel is an attack on the sovereignty of a nation, and if a NATO member put troops in Ukraine it opens the door wide for that to happen. Some of the smaller nations (Balkan states, for example) might not be so opposed to utilizing their own militaries for this, but it might just be shot down by the larger ones (Western Europe and North America).",

NATO countries like France and Canada didn't send any troops to Vietnam to back up their NATO allies America and Britain, even as Americans and Brits were fighting and dying in that war.\n\nArticle 5 mainly works in a \"NATO country was minding its own business, and then was attacked by an aggressor\" manner. That's not the same as sticking your nose into someone else's fight - like the US did in Vietnam - and then catching some return fire after joining the war.\n\nIf Poland jumps into the war on Ukraine's side and then some Poles get shot at by Russians as part of the pre-existing war they decided to join, that's not the same as Russia attacking a peaceful Poland out of nowhere. In terms of invoking Article 5, at least - obviously Russia is still the aggressor in Ukraine, and not Poland (who would presumably have Ukraine's permission to be there).",

I mean technically NATO made these rules so they could do what they want but they will not. NATO collectively, the big powers within, and even Sweden itself do NOT want to get involved physically in this war. Like at all. And NATO requires unanimously agreement to join, no way would everyone concur if they sent troops immediately before the vote, unless it was with NATOs blessing. Which would never happen. Idk I guess one could argue, but I would argue it\u2019s more likely aliens come down and initiate peace talks before that would happen \ud83d\ude02.",

In comparison nukes are very costly to maintain especially their detonators that unlike nukes have much shorter lifespan. On top of that unlike conventional military equipment that you can easily inspect and test, they were legally prohibited from testing it.\n\nOn balance of probabilities I would lean towards no nukes, but as I mentioned before, not something I would want to ever test.",

Which they purposefully use to try and make me afraid of helping Ukraine defend itself.\n\nIt is not my fault that Russia wants to do this. I am fed up of listening to you try and gas light me that it is my fault they are genociding Ukraine.\n\nIf it truly is my fault then fine. I take on this burden and suggest we dismantle the Russian state. It is all I can do as the responsible party in this situation.",

As the person that is responsible for this I have decided that the only course of action is to dismantle the Russian state. Since it is because of my control over Russia as a person existing peacefully with no interest in their shithole country that has allowed them to get in to the position of starting ww3 on my behalf.

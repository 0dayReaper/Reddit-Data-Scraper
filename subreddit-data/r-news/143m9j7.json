Companies like Meta or Google should have the resources to do this, and if they underfund those efforts that's really on them, but it could be incredibly challenging for a new start-up to be able to moderate all of the content on their platform.\n\nThis sort of legal requirement could limit the ability for small start-ups from entering the social media space, because they don't have the resources to adequately moderate content, which I'm all for limiting social media growth because I see a number of issues with it, but it really only becomes a barrier to entry for anyone but the very rich, which has its own problems.\n\nThis is an area where some sort of AI moderation, if it works, could work really well.",

Generally any website isn't going to spend extra money/resources enforcing things if they don't have to, they want to do the bare minimum to keep the website attractive for new/existing users. Or you can think about the darker side, in that they're effectively encouraged to let as much bad stuff happen as it brings in users (especially if other competing options don't allow it) until it becomes a huge media/stock problem. While it's messed up, it could be said about pretty much any media-sharing website until they were pressured into actually doing something about it. Just look at Reddit.",

They just are - just like we can't decide that we don't want to react to large breasts, nice ass or whatever we find attractive. So pedophiles only have the chance to be decent people, don't act on it and to seek professional help - but they can't become \"normal\".\n\nI imagine that this is quite a miserable life - sexual fulfillment is a powerful drug. And to know that you will never get it.... Just imagine if you were forbidden to ever be with a man/woman. Just try and see how long you would make it without flirting with/talking to/looking at/having sexual thoughts about a man/woman. I personally wouldn't make it very long, I think.",

Nothing else.  That was the entire point of the group, and they weren\u2019t hiding that point.  We spent a few days where all of us (a few thousand) reported the group, and a handful of individual posts from the group, every day.  We all kept getting the automated response that none of it went against facebook\u2019s tos.  Finally one of us from the group found out they knew someone who worked for Facebook, in a completely unrelated department.  It literally took that employee, that a group member knew, physically asking someone to look at it, in order to finally get it removed.  Within the hour of said employee directly reporting csam, in person, to someone who could actually do something about it, it got removed.  But if no one from our group had that connection, I\u2019d assume it would still be up.  \n\n(Also, I\u2019m scarred from the couple pictures I saw from said group, and they were still photos, I saw no videos.  So I definitely get why they have ai, instead of real people, do most of the monitoring.  But when thousands are reporting, maybe it should escalate to a human?  I don\u2019t know.)",

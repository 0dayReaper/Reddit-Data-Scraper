            "comment": "&gt; The time that van der Sloot ends up spending in the U.S. \u201cwill be extended until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings,\u201d including the appeal process should there be one, according to a resolution published in Peru\u2019s federal register. The resolution also states that U.S. authorities agreed to return van der Sloot to the custody of Peru afterward.\n\n&gt;Van der Sloot married a Peruvian woman in July 2014 in a ceremony at a maximum security prison. He was transferred among Peruvian prisons in response to reports that he enjoyed privileges such as television, internet access and a cellphone, and accusations that he had threatened to kill a warden.\n\nThis guy is a real piece of work. After he is found guilty in the US, it\u2019s back to Peru to finish his sentence, then back to the US to serve his sentence. \n\nWhat an evil POS.",

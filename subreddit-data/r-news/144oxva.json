If he ever got the greatest glory, his greed would tell him he needs more. If his gluttony was ever sated, his pride would tell him he needs more glory. It's an absolutely suicidal combination, and prevents him from ever reflecting and knowing when to call it quits.\n\nFrankly, he's probably still committing crimes right now, because he's hungry for it and no win will ever be enough. A psychiatrist would probably analyze this back to his pampered narcissism and deadbeat dad, but I'd be happy just seeing him face any sort of consequence.",

The legal system has been his own personal plaything that he's used successfully through out his life to avoid consequences and screw over everyone around him. \n\nHe literally just thought that he was untouchable. \n\nThis is a guy who was caught on the phone attempting to extort Zelensky and then had a direct paper trail of pulling back congressionally appropriated funds when Zelensky wouldn't play ball. And the Republicans failed to remove him from office. \n\nThen he spent the rest of his time harassing political enemies for the most innocuous slights and appointing fascist staff that would do whatever he wanted. I mean freaking DeJoy did his best to run the post office into the ground to try to rig the election and the absentee ballots. Then, when all that didn't work, he literally led a (failed) coup. And even then, Republicans still wouldn't actually remove him from office. \n\nIt's no fucking wonder he kept doing stupid, brazenly illegal shit. This is the first time in his life that he's seeing something resembling consequences.",

His primary skill apart from blathering is wrapping other greedy people up with him such that they can\u2019t let him go down for their own self interest. Banks, Politicians, etc. So he can use them but they need him not to fail.\n\nLuckily he\u2019s such an undisciplined, lazy, know nothing he couldn\u2019t be bothered to lead the coup. He set of off and stood back and watch TV. Had he been an actual doer of things he might have led a more dramatic dangerous moment. But he couldn\u2019t be bothered. It was beneath him to dirty his hands and he\u2019s too inept to lead from the front, thankfully. \n\nAnother wonderful irony is it was his hubris that got him here. He could have continued as a pseudo tycoon and TV personality, living in his gaudy fiefdom. But his ego demanded more. So he got himself into a job he was I\u2019ll qualified for that invited deep scrutiny. While in it he was immune and protected by those in bed with him. But that protection couldn\u2019t last forever. Wheels of justice grinding slow but fine and all that.\n\nI hope he ends his life in abject humiliation and prison. (But, you know, in a nice way.)",

Even if the ship is taking on water.\n\nShips are designed around containing/fighting fires.\n\nAreas below deck are also separated into watertight compartments with hydraulically operated watertight doors, the ship is still have to float with a compartment flooded (depending on what's in the compartment, they may even be able to carry on sailing)\n\nAny ship in arctic water is required to have survival suits in addition to life jackets.\n\n100% garuntee as soon as the fire alarm rang, all passengers were moved to the muster station(s), and there would have been enough survival suits there for everyone.\n\nGenerally, best practice is don the survival suit, launch life rafts, and climb into the rafts via the boarding ladder from the ship, to stay as dry as possibly to extend survivability as long as possible.\n\nGenerally jumping into the water is the absolute last resort after the absolute last resort of abandoning ship.\n\nI can also say from first hand experience, having jumped off an ice breaker into the arctic ocean in June, you will not die in 5 minutes wearing a survival suit.",

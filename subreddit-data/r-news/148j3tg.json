A trigger lock is literally less than 10 bucks, and so is a cable lock. A locking case is similarly cheap, especially for handguns. All my handgun lock boxes have been sub 30 bucks. My standing safe was only 600 from Costco. Do NOT let yourself become a statistic. Do NOT let a child have access to an unsecured gun.",

It is *negligent*, if a dangerous object is left in the path of a child's curios investigation.\n\nThis is to move the onus of \"oh if only the kid hadn't rummaged that drawer\". No it is perfectly normal and even desirable for the kid to rummage around, that is how kids learn. It is the adults job to secure the environment and supervise the kid for their safety. Adult failed their duty to ensure the safety of the child. So either *secure the environment so there isn't anything dangerous around for the kid to hurt themselves with, if you leave the child to rummage on its own* or *you are there to supervise the child like a hawk to intervene as need be*.

For the first 2 (and so many other consumer goods), we have regulations and PSA warning of the danger. For the 3rd, nothing. Because guns are the perfect consumer good. They started out perfect, they have remained perfect and will always be perfect. When I had my kids, their pediatrician had a chat with us about the dangers of swimming pools...that can't be done for guns anymore because some state governments expressly prohibit it. We can't have PSAs about making sure household guns are stored securely and unloaded. Because, once again, guns are perfect.",

I would be lying if I said everything was locked up though,  I have a few ww2 rifles that bolts stay removed that are in a compartment hidden in my room, and a shotgun with the barrel removed in a case as well. As before, ammo is separate and locked.  It's not hard to keep firearms in a safe way. People have this idea that the firearms should be ready and loaded to be ready... I can still get what I need if someone broke in within about 5 seconds, so the argument is invalid. If you have children there should be no weapons within reach, especially if they are in an operational capacity. Keep your family safe from your mistakes and lock everything up, unloaded",

It's absolutely unacceptable.\n\nMoreover, if you don't have the common sense to secure your firearm, at the very least don't leave it chambered? Why would you leave a round chambered? For someone who's even minimally trained, it takes like 1 second to chamber a round. On the other hand, there's zero possibility that a 2 year old has the hand and arm strength to pull a slide back to chamber a round in a semi auto pistol. For those that aren't gun savvy, it actually takes a little bit of strength to rack a slide back. It's not like Hollywood movies where it looks like it takes zero effort.\n\nMoreover, this is how criminals often get a hold of guns. They are stolen from folks that don't properly secure their firearms.\n\nBottom line, if you have kids at home or you have relative's kids visiting at any time, you need to secure your guns. If you aren't, you're being super negligent and imo, shouldn't own guns.\n\n**Edit:** For those that argue that they leave their gun accessible for purposes of quick access in home defense scenarios...get a quick access safe.

That's reactive and not preventative, no one thinks \"I better not drive drunk because if I get in a crash I might go to jail for life\".\n\nRather we have checkpoints to catch drunk drivers *before* they kill someone. Fixing irresponsible behavior before it harms others is a lot smarter than punishing irresponsible behavior more severely after it harms others.",

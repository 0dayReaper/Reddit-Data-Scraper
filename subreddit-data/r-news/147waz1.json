An attorney entered a guilty plea on his behalf to a civil infraction filed by the city of Davenport. \n\n\"Wold was cited and fined $300 by the city on May 30 for failing to maintain the building in a safe and sanitary condition. City Attorney Tom Warner said in a news conference earlier this month the citation was to prevent Wold from transferring the property to avoid a demolition order.\n\nWold was ordered to pay the fine as well as $95 in court costs in the Monday hearing, which came after he failed to appear and enter a plea on Friday.\"",

You have to pierce the corporate veil by showing unity of interest, wrongful conduct in the part of the owner and the owner's actions being the proximate cause of the harm.\n\nIf the company has too many interests then it's still possible if you can get past the business judgment rule by showing the person violated their duty of care towards the corporation in their actions. Very difficult to do, but possible. Mostly though this later situation comes up in shareholder derivative suits. No idea if it's applicable in a conventional tort or not.",

Going after him personally may work, but then the question is does he own much of anything of value? If not, he's essentially judgement-proof. Best hope for the victims is there are deep pockets to go after, such as contractors and their insurance carriers, the city, etc.\n\nCriminal charges are possible, but unlikely to hold up if challenged in court. He could choose to ignore the charges at his peril or take a plea deal. Regardless, I doubt he'll see the inside of a jail cell let alone prison. Hope to be wrong, but often that's how it plays out. People are rarely truly punished for ignoring safety causing death.",

Bluefish started running hard and everyone was catching them.\n\nThere was a young kid - late teenager to early 20s - who would catch one, reel it in, gut the fish, and then just tossed it on the deck.   He did this up and down the pier - 20-30 fish just laying there.  Then he left, leaving them all behind.  I grabbed as many as I could fit in the cooler to use so they wouldn't go to waste.\n\nI read this story and immediately remembered that day.   Some people just want to butcher the world for no reason.",

You have been wrong each time. \n\nRussia escalated to its maximum capacity in February-March of 2022. It will not use nukes short of maybe a NATO invasion. There are literally Ukrainian tanks operating in Belgorod as I write this, which useful idiots like you claimed were going to trigger a nuclear response. If we we listened to Russian boot-lickers, Russia today would be occupying most of Ukraine and committing even more genocide, and people like you would still be pathetically wringing your hands about how nothing can be done because of a hypothetical nuclear response.",

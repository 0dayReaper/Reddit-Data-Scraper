What data is going to paint the whole picture? \n\nCops are human beings and human beings are complex.  The very same individual that does something heroic may also do something terrible the very same week.  I've done great things before that I can recognize and be proud of but I've also done pretty shitty things in my life too that I'm ashamed of.  I'm glad none of this has the impact a police officers actions might.  \n\nI think the issues with police in the United States that we face are not necessarily because of the ratio of bad actors to good actors.  It's much more complicated.  I have dealt with cops before that were great and tried to help me, But ultimately their hands are tied because of the chain of command, bureaucracy, etc.  I have also dealt with police that were complete shit bags.  Rude individuals who love to swing their dick around.   \n\nUltimately I think the issues are systemic, just as racism is, just as mass incarceration is.  Police are given extremely tough jobs, and most don't have the training or organization in place to deal with the things they are handed.  \n\nThe war on drugs in particular has turned police into the face and the foot soldiers in a war against its own citizens. Having a war on drugs is a completely ridiculous concept.  They are chemical compounds. I can have a gram of cocaine sitting here and... It just sits there.  It doesn't act violent, It doesn't have any agency, it's just a clump of some powder.  The low level users and sellers are the ones who become the enemy.   The war on drugs is really a war on our citizens. \n\nAnd unfortunately the police are chain of command institutions and for the past 50 years or so drugs have been their focus because of politics. The various law enforcement organizations at the different levels of our federal republic prioritize drugs because of the economic incentives to do so.  When they seize a drug dealer's possessions, money, etc. they get to keep that money.  So it's no wonder the investment in drug enforcement has become so high compared to trying to solve rapes. \n\nBut a lot of cops as individuals are usually people who just picked a job when they were young.  You definitely have some that do it because they crave the power.  Others do it because they have good intentions.  But regardless of why they become police, as an individual they get sucked up into the corrupt nature of the organization because that is human nature.  It's a very difficult thing to resist. It is also very difficult to change organizations as a low level member. Even as someone higher up in the ranks is very difficult to change things. \n\nThe police also all end up developing mental issues like PTSD at some point or another because they do see some fucked up shit.  \n\nThe US has a conflicting culture where in one regard we have anti authoritarianism baked into our culture as we were founded as a country that overthrew the crown to form our own government.  But there's also that Puritan obedient aspect too.  \n\nPoverty, gang violence, racism, etc. all make the position of law enforcement in the USA to be as disastrous as it is.  The decentralized nature and dizzying overlap of law enforcement jurisdictions at the federal, state, local levels also makes it hard to hold police accountable.   \n\nI think for the most part most people are overall flawed but decent.  What's a simply look at it as \"police officers are mostly good\" or \"police officers are mostly scumbags\" lacks analytical depth and nuance that is necessary to address the root causes of issues we face with law enforcement.",

Which could hold a lot of good information but you wouldn't find well written entire mini essays or troubleshooting articles in there. People would throw that on their blog or link someone else's site in the chat. The medium (design wise) wasn't conducive to long, formatted messages, and other multimedia content. It was just an intermediary to get you to those things.\n\nDiscord had really good chat functionality, and good mobile experience for chat to boot; so people used it a lot. Then they doubled down on that desire with a lot of cool and good new features for chat.\n\nWhich isn't Discord's fault. It is a really good service, I use it all the time. Pleasant to use when you need it. Doesn't constantly bug you to use it more when you aren't. They were smart to give people what they wanted... What the creators wanted in a better way to manage VOIP and chat servers for online communities.\n\nIt doesn't seem like they have any desire to gate keep either. They aren't stopping people from taking content out of Discord and sharing it elsewhere. They have very good schema and open graph support so outside comtent shared inside of Discord stands out and is easily accessible.\n\nIn capitalizing and improving their little niche in good logical ways though they've inadvertently killed a big portion of the searchable internet.",

It has been quite good for information and troubleshooting, but the actual conversations have become utter garbage if you spend a second and look into them. The exact same types of comments are posted and upvoted in every thread, and sometimes the whole comment chain is entirely predictable. The whole thing has become some sort of meta copy-pasta machine. Upvote and downvote trends are also very predictable and repetitive. The tone of a post matters far more than its contents. People vote on the vibe of the post, not what it is actually saying. Illiteracy is widespread. Sometimes the opinions that get upvoted are actual hot garbage but you cannot ever go against the grain of the hivemind. The list goes on and on. \n\nIn conclusion, just realize that you won't be missing anything important and move on happily with your (far better and more valuable) real life.",

It's the individuals that keep twitter alive.\n\nReddit is completely different, we're not here for individual people but for communities and that community can transfer to any other site. I've already seen game modding groups go from forums, to reddit, to discord.\n\nIt's also why Reddit took over from digg so quickly. Reddit is just a giant forum and any other forum can replace it. We're only all here because it's the best option right now. As soon as it's not we'll all leave.",

I work for an ad fraud (click fraud) detection company, and we've been testing Reddit ads over the past year or so.\n\nThe rate of fake clicks is between 50% - 80%, and Reddit provides little to no transparency into how many of these fake clicks are being charged to advertisers. They also refuse to have a discussion on the topic. Recently they've been deleting click fraud posts from the official Reddit ads subreddit.\n\nThis is the biggest issue they're facing, and it makes me wonder if all this API stuff is a distraction to keep the topic away from click fraud as they get ready to launch their IPO.",

                            "comment": "Click fraud rates depend on a number of factors, such as the ad network, the advertiser's industry, the locations being targeted, the cost of the keywords, and more.\n\nFor example, it's quite normal for medical adverts, in the US, targeting US visitors, on the Microsoft Ads network, to receive around 80% fake clicks. That's because the cost per click is very high ($50), so scammers are incentivised to target these ads. Additionally, Microsoft Ads' click fraud detection is dire.\n\nBy comparison, an IoT camera, in Vietnam, targeting Vietnamese visitors, on the Google Ads network, will get a low amount of click fraud, as the cost per click is low. By \"low amount of click fraud\", I mean 1% - 5%. Google Ads do a bad job at detecting click fraud, but they're miles ahead of Microsoft Ads.\n\nI would say the average amount of click fraud, overall, is 5% - 10%.\n\nClick fraud typically works like this:\n\n1. A scammer, typically someone with a strong understanding of the pay-per-click (PPC) advertising ecosystem, creates a website, contacts an advertising network like Google Ads or Microsoft Ads, and opens a publisher advertising account. The publisher advertising account allows him to place other people's adverts on his website.\n\n2. Instead of waiting for real people to visit his website, he programs a bot to come to his website and click on the ads. To avoid detection, he uses a bot framework like puppeteer-extra and its stealth plugin, routes the bot's traffic through a residential proxy service, and uses technology to randomise his bot's device fingerprint. The result of this effort is the bot appears to be a real person, with a unique IP address and device fingerprint every time it clicks on an ad. \n\n3. After clicking on an ad, the bot will sometimes generate fake conversions at the advertiser's website. This will be a no-cost (free of charge) conversion, such as submitting a leads form, creating an account, or adding items to a shopping cart. The fake conversion tricks the ad network into thinking a real person clicked on the ad, and wastes the advertiser's time as he fruitlessly contacts the fake lead.\n\n4. Since the advertising networks have less than ideal click fraud detection (often virtually no click fraud detection), and are easily fooled by fake conversions, advertisers are charged for most fake clicks. The money is shared by the advertising networks and scammers, in a roughly 50/50 split. \n\nThis is quite different to the Reddit ads situation. Reddit get to keep all the advertising money for themselves, so there aren't third-party scammers ripping off advertisers.\n\nInstead, Reddit has a ton of bots (scrapers and automated sock puppet accounts) which are clicking on the ads, either accidentally or to trying to simulate real visitors.\n\nI'm happy to elaborate on any of the above.",

We kept our promise. Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.\n\nBy contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate",

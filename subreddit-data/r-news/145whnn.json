My friend was behind me, I passed walking dude on his left and suddenly this crash in the trees to my right, I thought for sure a tree was falling, but a GIANT FUCKING MOOSE comes crashing out of the trees directly to my right and I can't stop in time, we almost collide, he runs across the trail so close to me I can see the individual hairs on his shoulder, which was maybe 6 inches in front of my face. \n\nMy eye level on roller blades must have been 5'7 and I wasn't even as tall as his back, he's literally hoofing it too, moose on a mission, and crashed through the trees on the right. I turn around and my friend is dead stopped, eyes wide and I'm like DID YOU SEE THAT and he's like HOLY SHIT I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO DIE and the guy with the headphones was just still bopping along, didn't even notice. \n\nSeriously, if I hadn't slowed slightly to pass that guy I'd be roadkill.

It doesn't roar, or bellow, or screech, it simply charges.  That's a moose.\n\nNow give it the hyper-aggression of rabies, along with a lack of regard for survival.  That's a combo that can turn a family camping trip into a group funeral.",

            "comment": "That's not really surprising, larger animals get infected easier and more often. Cats/dogs get reported more often due to the nature of human interactions and pure numbers, while rodents despite the prejudice are actually not a major concern for rabies in America.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWild animals larger than cats/small dogs get rabies CONSTANTLY. We have done a lot of work and had a bunch of success with deer in particular but Cows, skunks, coyotes, foxes, Raccoons etc are common carriers. Bats dominate with multiple species inundated with the virus though.\n\nHorses, llamas, alpacas are also a sneaky vector. A lot of people with only a few head will skip or lapse on rabies vaccines and the proximity to family members with these type of pets can make it a tragic slip up. These type of farm animals can get something called colic which is similar in symptoms to bloat in a dog. Most often the animal will lay down on its side and usually be seen moving its head around in distress. Sadly, in larger animals it's not unusual for rabies to start off in this fashion with the animal laying down and flailing. This in turn can lead to the owner attempting treatment for colic/bloat which can lead to exposure. Bloat/colic has similar symptoms but are not the same thing, however they both have similar emergency treatment requiring access through the mouth which can save the animals life if properly identified but can also be risky due to having to be in and around the mouth. If you keep animals outside, learn to recognize and test for rabies and always use caution. Foam may not be obvious or may not even be noticed depending on the stage and other factors. Learn to recognize signs of neurological damage and distress and always use caution when an animal suddenly changes in behavior. Sadly the only surefire 100% test is to collect the brain and send it for lab testing. On the flip side, the rabies vaccine is much much more bearable and easier nowadays if you ever are exposed.\n\nSo, in short, get your animals vaccinated and be aware that larger wild animals can and do get infected although bats are always the biggest worry here.",

Communal spread is easy with the huge colony all hanging with scratching and biting just kind of being a natural byproduct of animal behavior and general interactions.  Rabies is not spread through blood, urine, or guano. Rabies is also a mammal specific virus and bats just win by the numbers. If birds or insects could catch it then bats might be way lower on the list\n\nAs the u/dorkofthepolisci noted the bites go unnoticed most of the time and rabies can take ages for symptoms to develop. Add in that bats can fly and also are crazy good at squeezing into small areas and you have a unique and convenient way for a mammal based virus to spread far and wide. Rodents also seem like they would be a good vector but the current theory is that most rodents die from the initial bite (cat/dog/larger rodent) with addition to rabies just not being as common as a lot of other viruses which rodents do carry.\n\nInoculation efforts have been mixed depending on the animal but a lot of focus and new science is being pushed towards bats in particular with a lot of promising signs. Deer have also had HUGE campaigns to inoculate the wildlife with great success. One thing of note here is that \"rabies\" is actually 17/18 virus's within the Lyssavirus genus so that can at time add layers of complexity. \n\nAlso worth noting that only like 1% of bats have any version of the Lyssavirus but that the 1% has a much much higher interaction rate with humans due to the changes in behavior caused by the virus.",

Really, the only things that could get close enough to them to bite them and give them rabies are also likely either to mortally wound them or outright kill them in the process cause they'd have to be very big and very strong. Typically, most animals would either get stomped or impaled before they could get a bite in, even in a bloodlust state.\n\nSo, it's not super common for moose to get infected with it. But it can still happen every so often if they walk away fine enough to survive or a small animal with rabies manages to sneak up on them.\n\nEdit: Apparently, rabies has been spreading through foxes in the area all winter, so that could be a good candidate for a small critter getting the jump on this poor dude.",

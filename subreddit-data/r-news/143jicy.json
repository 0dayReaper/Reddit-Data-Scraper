I get that it seems they're all corrupt in the same way, and that's my point - they KNOW people's opinion of the Supreme Court will faulter if these things aren't addressed, and here we are, nothing being done, nothing being said, and the people losing faith in the courts. That's a very dangerous thing, when democracies depend on the will of the people and their faith in the systems.",

I also think that if we implement those term limits we also need to limit access to the SCOTUS justices during that term. This level of power should come with the sacrifice of burden and not be a goddamn meal ticket.",

Germany is as much a federation as the United States is, and their upper chamber ([Bundesrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Bundesrat)) employs a system of [Degressive Proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degressive_proportionality) to [assign seats to the states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Bundesrat#Today), with the largest state of 17 million people having 6 seats and the smallest state of 670,000 people having 3 seats. \n\nIt's a similar system in the [Parliament of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_in_the_European_Parliament) (not a federation (yet), but built with the need of respecting smaller countries' voices in mind) where the ratio in seats between smallest (Malta) and largest (Germany) country is 1:16, rather than the 1:160 that their population numbers would require. And in the EU Council, where every country *does* have the same representation, they apply a system of [Qualified Majority](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/qualified-majority/), where two conditions need to be met: 55% of member states (15 out of 27) need to be in favour and they need to represent 65% of the EU population (~ 300 of 450 million people). That way, neither can small countries band together to block legislation but also large countries can't just force their will onto smaller ones.",

Gore*.\n\nToday's Court is also issuing excruciatingly bad decisions - *Citizens United*, *Hobby Lobby*, *DC v. Heller*, etc. But that's not the topic of this post.\n\nThe topic of this post is Supreme Court personal corruption and the absolute rejection of applicable, enforceable ethical norms and standards.\n\nThe judiciary, and the Supreme Court in particular, has historically portrayed itself as obligated to avoid \"the appearance of impropriety.\" Today, we have *actual, indisputable* impropriety of at least one Supreme Court justice. It was deliberately hidden and lied about for decades. It is now overt, despite the efforts of those parties to keep it hidden. And yet, both the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Speaker of the House refuse to do anything about it in order to preserve their political power.\n\nThis is nauseatingly bad for the entire legal system, and nothing of this sort has ever occurred before in the history of the Supreme Court.",

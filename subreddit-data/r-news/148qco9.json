Or by cargo jet to Nome.  Since Cargo jets are the main way of getting everything out here, they are usually pretty full of food and other basic supplies.  Then to get out the villages, you have to put them on a single engine bush plane to fly it out to the villages which again have to transport food and other basic essentials too. And all of this is only true if the weather is good.  Bad weather means you ain't shipping anything.",

Genetically male, but with a low-functioning androgen receptor that means testosterone doesn't work as well as it should. The traditional recommendation would be to surgically remove the penis in infancy and raise the baby as a girl. That could lead to a scenario where the baby grows into an adult cisgender woman who has no sexual sensation because that tissue was removed, and she might have chosen to keep her natal parts if given the option. Or maybe the baby grows up to identify as male, and you have to explain why you cut his dick off. Pain from scaring can also be a complication that can majorly reduce sexual pleasure.\n\nA better approach is to leave it be (unless there is a medically necessary reason for surgery) and let the kid grow up. Surgery is still an option later, when they are old enough to be able to consent.\n\nUnfortunately, many parents still opt for the traditional approach because they want their baby to \"look normal\" and low priority is often given to a baby's ability to orgasm as an adult, especially for babies assigned female (which most of them are).",

Elite athletes tend to have higher than average height across genders, and above-average height is not currently classified as an athletic advantage requiring regulation; \n\n\u2022 On average, trans women who are pre-testosterone suppression still have lower Lean Body Mass (LBM), Cross Section Area (CSA), and strength than cis males. This indicates that the performance benefit experienced by these individuals cannot be generalized by examining cis male athletes; \n\n\u2022 Non-athletic trans women experience significant reduction in LBM, CSA, and strength loss within 12 months of hormonal suppression. It is important to note that this 12-month threshold is arbitrarily defined, and no significant studies examine the rate of LBM, CSA or strength reduction over time; \n\n\u2022 When adjusting for height and fat mass, LBM, CSA, and strength after 12 months of testosterone suppression, trans women still retained statistically higher levels than sedentary cis women. However, this difference is well within the normal distribution of LBM, CSA, and strength for cis women (Jassen et al., 2000); \n\n\u2022 LBM, CSA, and strength loss continues for trans women after the 12-month initial testosterone suppression; \n\n\u2022 The limited available evidence examining the effect of testosterone suppression as it directly affects trans women\u2019s athletic performance showed no athletic advantage exists after one year of testosterone suppression (Harper, 2015; Roberts et al., 2020; Harper, 2020); \n\n\u2022 Post gonad removal, many trans women experience testosterone levels far below that of pre-menopausal cis women.\"",

It's very thorough (freely available as a PDF).\n\n\"**Available evidence indicates trans women who have undergone testosterone suppression have no clear biological advantages over cis women in elite sport.**\n\n\u2022 The higher levels of red blood cell count experienced by cis men is removed within the first four months of testosterone suppression;\n\n\u2022 There is no basis for athletic advantage conferred by bone size or density, other than advantages achieved through height. Elite athletes tend to have higher than average height across genders, and above-average height is not currently classified as an athletic advantage requiring regulation; \n\n\u2022 On average, trans women who are pre-testosterone suppression still have lower Lean Body Mass (LBM), Cross Section Area (CSA), and strength than cis males. This indicates that the performance benefit experienced by these individuals cannot be generalized by examining cis male athletes; \n\n\u2022 Non-athletic trans women experience significant reduction in LBM, CSA, and strength loss within 12 months of hormonal suppression. It is important to note that this 12-month threshold is arbitrarily defined, and no significant studies examine the rate of LBM, CSA or strength reduction over time; \n\n\u2022 When adjusting for height and fat mass, LBM, CSA, and strength after 12 months of testosterone suppression, trans women still retained statistically higher levels than sedentary cis women. However, this difference is well within the normal distribution of LBM, CSA, and strength for cis women (Jassen et al., 2000); \n\n\u2022 LBM, CSA, and strength loss continues for trans women after the 12-month initial testosterone suppression; \n\n\u2022 The limited available evidence examining the effect of testosterone suppression as it directly affects trans women\u2019s athletic performance showed no athletic advantage exists after one year of testosterone suppression (Harper, 2015; Roberts et al., 2020; Harper, 2020); \n\n\u2022 Post gonad removal, many trans women experience testosterone levels far below that of pre-menopausal cis women.\"",

There are approximately 15 million high school students in the United States, and approximately 8 million of them participate in high school sports. A CDC study published in 2019 estimated that 1.8 percent of high school students are transgender, meaning there are roughly 270,000 transgender students in U.S. high schools. But a report by the Human Rights Campaign found that only 14% of transgender boys and 12% of transgender girls play sports. Given all of those numbers, it's statistically possible that there are some 35,000 transgender student-athletes in high school, which would mean 0.44% of high school athletes are transgender\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/32115820/young-transgender-athletes-caught-middle-states-debates?platform=amp",

They also state that there is irreparable harm being done with specific gender affirming surgical procedures, ones that are exceptionally rare for kids to begin with and never involve genitals.\n\nBut while citing that harm, they provide carveouts for a plethora of medical conditions that also use those same drugs, exceptions for the same medical procedures for cis gender kids, including ones for non medical and cosmetic reasons, and also ban non surgical/medical methods that are part of the gender affirmation process such as banning professionals from engaging in therapy that promotes social transition.\n\nThe courts then challenge them to provide medical evidence of why it's harmful enough to ban for demographic A but still fine to leave legal for demographics B, C, and D. The states are often simply not able to provide medical evidence for this that wouldn't get shredded in court.\n\nThe lawmakers also use discriminatory language in the bills and in public facing comments, then aren't able to provide any legal or medical reason that the language was used. Example would be how they claim in the law and statements that gender identities are not real, but are unable to back that statement up by credible expert testimony.\n\nThe end result is the determination that the law has no actual medical or scientific basis and therefore would run afoul of the 14th by applying it unequally to a specific demographic.",

The teen they had on the report was transitioning and they were very unhappy with their current identity. Ever since HRT and gender affirming care they have felt much better and freer since. \n\nI've never understood why governments and governors are so adamant against this type of policy. I feel it'd just make transitioning teens more uncomfortable and depressed. Suicide rates are already pretty high for them, so I don't see why they can't be happy like everyone else. \n\nIf they want to change genders or express themselves, why should I or any government entity try to make that more difficult?",

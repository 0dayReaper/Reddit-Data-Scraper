It isn't as clear the purpose of a gun is to shoot a target as a hammer is to hit a nail.\n\nEdit: /u/bionicmanmeetspast has pointed out a further reason that better states why the comparison is invalid. Anything a gun shoots actually is a target \"by definition\". Therefore anything is a target if you have a gun. Anything is not a nail if you have a hammer.",

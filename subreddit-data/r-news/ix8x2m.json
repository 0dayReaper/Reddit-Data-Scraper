Can't curtail it, gotta go the day we get it, etc. At least out here in western CO we don't fuck with political mail.\n\n\nEdit: this blew up more than I ever could have imagined. Guys, us mail carriers want a fair election as much as all of you do. And we're doing everything we can to ensure it. If you want to thank your mail carrier for everything they do, a cold bottle of water or a popsicle on a hot day really means a lot to us. Just thanking us, means a lot to us. We hear \"I don't want it if it's a bill\" ALL. THE. TIME. We don't choose what you receive, we just bring it to you.\n\nOh, and make sure to vote if you're in the US. Even if you don't trust us, mask up, glove up, head to the polls. Stay safe, but don't be silenced, regardless of where your political beliefs lie. Agree with our system or not, there are entire countries of people out there who's voices can't be heard. Make sure yours is.",

Rather that it is a \"practice\" rather than an official policy and is left up to individual local managers.\n\n\n&gt; Apart from the installation of ballot monitors and the \r\nuse of \u201call clears\u201d and logs to track Election Mail through \r\nthe USPS network, the extra measures USPS contemplates taking are considered \u201cpractices\u201d not \u201cpolicies,\u201d meaning, as Glass \r\nexplained, that they are not required and are instead \r\n\u201ctypically left to local managers\u201d to implement. (Tr. 100:5-\r\n9.) With regard to why these practices are not more uniform \r\nor formal policies, he testified that \u201cexpediting measures \r\ncannot be applied equally.\u201d (Tr. 105:8-9.) Glass pointed to \r\nmeasures in place to monitor such practices, but also noted \r\nthat if the practices were not properly implemented, by the \r\ntime headquarters investigated, it would be too late for \r\naffected ballots. (Tr. 104:11-18.) He also observed that \u201cnot \r\nin every case is every method the same and . . . valid,\u201d \r\nbecause \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t deliver[] throughout the entire state of \r\nGeorgia where you might be able to deliver to the city of \r\nAtlanta,\u201d for example. (Tr. 103:5-8.) Furthermore, some of \r\nthese measures require the use of overtime. (Tr. 107:3-9.)\r\nCintron testified that in the past, USPS has run late trips \r\nto ensure that Election Mail is delivered, and that the same \r\nplan would be in place this year. (Tr. 68:2-6.) However, as \r\ndiscussed above, USPS employees appear to lack clear guidance \r\nregarding whether, and under what circumstances, overtime is \r\npermissible. See supra Section I.B.2. Glass testified that, \r\nif overtime is restricted, the capacity of USPS employees to \r\nundertake extra measures to deliver Election Mail would be \r\ndiminished. (Tr. 107:10.)",

Thousands of mail-in votes weren't counted because the local USPS office stated to the Supervisor of Election that they did not have any undelivered ballots on premise.  It was discovered the next day that they had thousands of ballots just waiting to be delivered that they failed to deliver.  They also failed to notify the SoE that they were present; a courtesy they have performed for many, many years, including letting the SoE and staff directly retrieve the ballots instead of having USPS personnel deliver.\n\nThis stinks of local Managers being told to stall/delay delivery.",

It is almost problematic if you vote the day you get your primary ballot because your candidate might be out of a national race before your state primaryelection day.\n\nIn addition to the mail ballot in the pre-paid envelope, we also have physical boxes throughout the rural county. The boxes are super sturdy (moreso than a normal mailbox), put in locations with public oversight, and are only opened for submissions during the period between ballots going out and election day.\n\nOn top of all of this, you can still vote in person.\n\n\n\nIt honestly makes me want to cry when I see people in the south standing in line for hours for the opportunity to vote in a general election.\n\nCompletely different Americas.",

If an officer does not activate the camera or tampers with the footage, then their testimony will be inadmissible, there is a presumption that the missing footage would have shown malfeasance on the part of the cop, and they could be fired.",

He said they don't just protect the community they protect the officers. \n\nThis is how things should be done. If they're ending immunity then they need to make it mandatory for these departments to have body cameras, narrow and wide angle front facing cameras on police cars. These do exist. There is one Brand that has front facing wide angle, a directable narrow angle camera, a camera that records the back seat, and the body camera that it records all at once. \n\nThe issue is budget. This company isn't cheap. They enough money for that equipment that after 20 cars the equipment cost of just that camera system alone for each car cost as much as 1 more car.\n\nIf these guys want these cars to have better cameras and the police to have body cameras then they'll need to cough up the money for the police to get them.\n\nSauce: I used to install these things.",

Where the fuck did the money come from for all the sights the cops have? Seems like they could repurpose those funds else where.\n\nEdit: to the people commenting saying some departments do this or that. I'm drawing attention to the amount of money police departments spend no questions asked. Why does money matter when we discuss camera systems for officers? but not when we discuss tear gas, flash bangs, weapon attachments, vehicles and lawsuits? That's the point of my comment.",

Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said that Congress \"recognizes the necessity of the Abrams tank to our national security and authorizes an additional $120 million for Abrams tank upgrades. **This provision keeps the production lines open in Lima, Ohio, and ensures that our skilled, technical workers are protected.\"**\n\nhttps://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/12/18/congress-again-buys-abrams-tanks-the-army-doesnt-want.html",

By this I mean, the US military keeps preparing for a full scale war with another super power. The problem is that all the super powers are also nuclear powers. So if for example, we ever ended up in a full scale war with China, everyone's dead, whether we've got a fleet of joint strike fighters or not.",

Say an officer assaults a minor rape victim, should this footage be released? Should it be released without the victim's consent? Without further investigation? Without editing out younger family member's identities?  \n\nIdk. Just one of many hypotheticals to consider.\n\nEdit: a lot of the privacy aspects are covered in the bill.

State courts handle cases of state law, federal courts handle cases of federal law, and potential cases of conflict between stateand federal laws like this one. We'll ignore the state courts for now, every state is slightly different.  \n\nThere are hundreds of local federal courts across the nation, you most likely have one in your nearest big city that you can visit. Each one has one or more federal judges presiding. Each federal judge is appointed by the President personally and serves for life, unless they retire or are impeached. (In practice, since there are hundreds of judges, the President just rubber-stamps the recommendations.) \n\nIf there's a good reason to call into question the ruling of a lower federal court, the next step up are the 13 circuit courts. **This is where the districts come in.** [From this map](https://dickbailey.com/global_pictures/district_Map2858.png), there are 11 circuit courts for 11 regional districts, as well as one for Washington DC and a Federal Circuit Court. Each circuit court serves its district. (Yes, this means cases appealed from Alaska or Hawaii have to fly to the continental US to appear in court. It's inconvenient.) So if a circuit court makes a ruling, that ruling will impact all states under that court's jurisdiction. \n\nLastly, the Supreme Court of the United States. It really only hears cases that involve interpretation of the Constitution, but if that's a question then one can appeal the case up from the circuit courts. (Or from a State Supreme Court, that's another route.) The difference with the Supreme Court is that it chooses which cases it will hear. So if the Supreme Court doesn't want to hear a case or thinks the outcome is obvious, they can just deny to hear it, effectively upholding the lower court's ruling.",

Sovereign immunity and species thereof is a principle of British common law of kingly immunity, more simply \"The king can do no wrong\" because if the king does something, it's necessarily legal as the king is the source of law.\n\nImmunity therefore is an assumption of state power that a state may choose to *abrogate* if it so chooses, such as when a state allows for limited suit in tort, typically called a \"&lt;State&gt; Tort Claims Act&gt;. So it is considered legal for a state to be immune from direct suit, but a state can always choose to end portions of that immunity.\n\nRemoving qualified immunity to police employees of the state via statute is entirely allowed, because the right doesn't originate ex nihilo from the police employee but is rather granted by the state. Should the state stop granting that immunity, that's totally a-okay.\n\nThis should never get to an appellate court, let alone SCOTUS. Colorado is totally within its power to give up its power.",

In Portland, Oregon they had to lower requirements because not many were applying. In fact even after lowering the requirements to be a cop they are still 50 cops short of what they wanted to have. Being a cop right now is about the same level as being a defense lawyer for a child molester( my personal opinion). \n\nAccording to snopes states can end Qualified immunity. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in Colorado.",

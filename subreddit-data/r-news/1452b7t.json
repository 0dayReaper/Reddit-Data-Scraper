I just don't call it chili",

Therefore, Paxton's responsibilities do not include prosecuting himself for felony securities fraud. The Collin County district attorney is responsible for prosecution but he recused himself because he is buddies with Paxton. They hired special council instead. The delay in prosecution has been because of a few things. The two biggest delays have been related to a lawsuit (by one of Paxton's buddies) claiming the special council are being paid too much and the issue of venue. Paxton is from Collin County so naturally he wants the trial to happen there. The prosecution wants the venue to be in Harris County. My understanding is that this issue of payment for the special prosecutors has been the number one reason for the delay.",

AND, first energy gave a lot of money to the governor and his daughter so that he would sign the bill, which is clear bribery, but they have somehow emerged from this scandal unscathed.\n\n\n\nsadly the republicans are still in power in this state, largely because how effectively they've gerrymandered the districts.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.cincinnati.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/06/03/ohio-corruption-house-bill-6-bribery-timeline-larry-householder/5248218001/",

There were many volunteers collecting signatures for an opposing ballot and each one of them was flanked by 2 to 3 hb6 \"supporters\". These supporters were literally all 6 foot+ tall young black dudes from downtown who were obviously just paid to follow, harass, and intimidate anybody opposing first energy. Ill be honest all the white suburbanites didnt know what to do so it was very effective. Then at the end of the evening they all went to a guy in a suit to recieve an envelope and leave. It was wild and sad to see hate and cultural distrust be used to promote a thieving agenda in this way. But it worked so there is that I guess.",

After the Browns signed the serial rapist QB, they also gave him a fully guaranteed contract (the first in the history of the NFL). First Energy responded by removing their name from the Browns stadium and now Browns fans are happy because they can root for their serial rapist quarterback with the fully guaranteed contract without having to subject their integrity to the kind of scrutiny associated with attending games at a stadium bearing the name: First Energy.\n\nEdit: Browns fans can downvote me all to hell and back. Even though the details of my post are obviously not entirely accurate (for comedic effect) the end result of my post is spot on. BROWNS FANS WERE HAPPY THE FIRST ENERGY NAME WAS OFF THEIR STADIUM BUT THEIR QUARTERBACK IS STILL A RAPIST.",

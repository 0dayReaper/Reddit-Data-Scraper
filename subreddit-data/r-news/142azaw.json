For Social Security to function, you need to maintain a strong ratio of workers to retirees (or have not horribly underfunded the pensions since day 1\u2026). Given that the French are living significantly longer than when the program was set up, are already struggling to compete with other developed countries for jobs, and are having far fewer children than they used to, something has to change. The options are:\n\n* Increase the retirement age.\n* Decrease retirement benefits.\n* Raise taxes (which would potentially exacerbate the problem as their corporate taxes are very high compared to the rest of Europe and their last attempt to increase personal tax rates failed)\n* Cut spending elsewhere.\n\nMarcon was also heavily elected to address these very issues, and his campaign of fixing France\u2019s financial problems was incredibly popular. The issue is that while vague plans to improve a country\u2019s fiscal health are popular, no one likes the specifics of either raising taxes or cutting spending.",

The French don't thumb their noses at the wealthy, otherwise we wouldn't have had Sarkozy or Macron as presidents. The French are also very career-driven, like everywhere else.\n\nNote that Macron doesn't care about political suicide. He can't run for the next elections and he probably already has a nice cushy job lined-up. What he does care about though is the left threatening the status quo. This is one thing his corporate overlords can't tolerate. His answer right now is to promote the far right, i.e. the one party that is sure to win against the left in 2027. Hence why neo-Nazis can protest in peace while unions get crushed by the police in the streets. \n\nJust to say that it is not political suicide. It is totally part of his plan to ruin social security and public services. And far too many French are too apathetic to do anything about it.",

For Sarkozy, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal was just too unstable a person to ever win. For Macron, he was up against Le Pen both times and the votes were so split during the first round of voting during the '22 election.\n\nSarkozy and Macron never won on a superiorly popular mandate and most certainly people didn't vote for them because \"they were rich\". That is the most foolish statement I have heard in some time.\n\nEspecially for Macron during his first win, he won because the traditional parties had collapsed and Marcon emerged as something shiny and new. Sarkozy and Hollande had done such damage to their respective parties standing in France, that people just wanted anything but the 2. \n\nSecond time well it was to keep Le Pen out of office more than anything.\n\nI don't think I've ever heard someone ever say \"I am voting for Sarkozy because he is rich\".\n\nSince you probably don't speak French, here is some reading in English for you.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/opinion/why-rich-people-make-the-french-squirm.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/opinion/why-rich-people-make-the-french-squirm.html)",

Like Lenny Bruce \u2014 whom he idolized and who helped him get his first agent \u2014 Carlin saw the stand-up comic as a social commentator, rebel and truth teller. He challenged conventional wisdom and tweaked the hypocrisies of middle-class America. He made fun of society's outrage over drugs, for example, pointing out that the \"drug problem\" extended to middle-class America as well, from coffee freaks at the office to housewives hooked on diet pills. He talked about the injustice of Muhammad Ali's banishment from boxing for avoiding the draft \u2014 a man whose job was beating people up losing his livelihood because he wouldn't kill people: \"He said, 'No, that's where I draw the line. I'll beat 'em up, but I don't want to kill 'em.' And the government said, 'Well, if you won't kill people, we won't let you beat 'em up.' \" '",

The frequency with which I see Carlin mentioned by self-identified populists is far greater than...basically any other comedian or comic. \n\nBut Carlin's ideas, while packaged in an entertaining way, are generally fairly simple ideas and have usually been explored more deeply in the writings of philosophers, critics, and others. I guess I just don't understand why people *stop* at Carlin, as if he's all you  need to build a coherent critique of power.

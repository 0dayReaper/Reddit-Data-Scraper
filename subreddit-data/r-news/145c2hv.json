            "comment": "It's so weird that people are gravitating towards the \"Now I can't\" statement when there are far, FAR, more damning things in the indictment. Like in \"section 6, paragraph b\" where he says he shouldn't be showing them the documents, while literally showing them the documents. That's something most prosecutors would call \"Ironclad\". And that's only be beginning. If you haven't read the indictment yourself, I highly recommend you do. It's...wow...Easily the most bonkers (serious) Indictment I've ever read.\n\nMany prosecutors operate on a simple tenant of two questions;\n\n1. Did they know it was wrong prior to breaking the law?\n2. Did they attempt to conceal their actions or hinder investigations?\n\nIf you can prove those, it's a very simple case.  \n\n\n\\[edit\\] rewrite on #2 for clarity",

Just FYI and I will tell him as well: Not sure how many he wants to take on Friday on the plane. We will NOT have a room for them. Plane will be full with luggage. Thank you!\"\"\n\nBwahahaha",

TRUMP told the individuals that the plan was \"highly confidential\" and \"secret\". TRUMP also said \"as president I could have declassified it,\" and, \"Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret.\"\n\nHoly fucking shit, they got him red-handed",

(or whatever the conjured buzzword was then)\n\nTrump repaid Erdogan by pulling U.S. support for the Kurds in Syria (who bravely did most of the heavy lifting against Daesh/ISIL there) and ceding the territory to Russia and Iran so they could crush the rest of the country with the Asaad regime.\n\nNow Russia has more territory to utilize against NATO and Ukraine and probably American secrets as well.\n\nSickening to see SockPuppet McCarthy cede his soul.",

            "comment": "This here reads like someone who had plans to sell this information to get in good with (or brag to)  some of his dictator friends. He's already expressed his contempt for this country on Jan 6. He's already shown a lack of discretion when it comes to classified information. Who knows what kind of blackmail material other countries have on him. Classified material could be very useful in that situation. \n\nInquiries should definitely be made into what the Saudis got for their $2 billion investment with Kushner. \n\nI dare any conservative to read this indictment and put anyone other than Trump as the target and not read this as someone looking to sell out his or her country to the highest bidder. A traitor of the worst sort. Whether that was his intention or not,  that's exactly what it looks like.  \n\nThe fact that he tried to hide and keep them when the feds came for them makes it look even worse. \n\nThis isn't just an error in judgment (Pence, Biden, Hillary's e-mails), this was deliberate.  If he had been anyone else, he'd probably be in a secured location breaking down under interrogation well before now.\n\nEdit spelling",

In all the instances they are going to Whataboutism, he had a DOJ and Attorney General who could have brought criminal indictment\u2019s, yet in those 4 years, the only ones charged were his associates. I just got done watching the Five on Fox and it was filled with Whataboutism.",

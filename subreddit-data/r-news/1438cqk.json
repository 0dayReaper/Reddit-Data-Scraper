The boy and his 12-year-old brother then went to speak to Lorincz, and she opened her door and swung at them with an umbrella. They told their mother what happened and \"Owens approached Lorincz's home, knocked on the door multiple times, and demanded that Lorincz come outside. Lorincz then fired one shot through the door, striking Owens in her upper chest.\n\nThis is nuts.",

Make it as hard as possible for them to deny this. Rack up a bunch of charges and let this old hag rot in a cell for the rest of her life. Unfortunately there's no punishment that can match the crime. She's already old and she's stolen the life of a young woman and taken a mother away from children. Hope she gets properly dunked on in prison.",

People fuck up a lot in the justice system. We can convict murderers... but also sometimes we can convict innocent  people and honestly it's not like police would be penalized for incorrectly arresting someone. They arrest people incorrectly all the time and the law provides them leniency to do it ad long as they believed they were following the law. And to be fair sometimes it's reasonable to arrest someone and it later turn out they're innocent. \n\nEdit: Fixed horrible grammar/typos",

Now that's interesting: Why would the deceased have assaulted the offender before?

A couple weeks later the mother stormed over and tried to just walk in but the door was locked, then pounded on the door with fists and feet for the 30 seconds it took me to wipe chicken grease off my hands and open the door. She demanded I make my son stop playing in the yard with other children--especially *her* children because he was far too old to be playing with young kids and it was completely inappropriate, suggesting sexual impropriety. Again, my kid was *12 years old* and clearly hadn't hit puberty yet, and he happened to be the youngest of the kids in the apartment complex *by two years!.* He was also the only kid in the bunch that behaved himself. When I explained he was only 12, her exactly words were \"Well, he *looks* like a man.\"\n\nNothing but problems from her and her husband the 3 years they lived there, including her claiming she had my kid on video peeping through her windows at night but she wouldn't show the video, and the date &amp; time she claimed and repeatedly confirmed it happened he was on a school bus returning from a school trip 200 miles away. \n\nShe called the cops and when they came to my front door she was standing ~10 feet away saying they need to arrest my kid. I asked the cop if he's seen the video and he said she had accidentally deleted it. I then asked about the date &amp; time of the incident and repeated exactly what she had been claiming. I immediately pulled out a copy of the signed &amp; dates permission slip for the school trip and both a teacher &amp; principal's signed statement that he was on the bus returning from the trip, and printed screenshots of social media posts with him in pictures *at* the school trip location. That bitch has the fucking audacity to change her story on the spot and say it was the night after that which happened to be hours *after* she first confronted me about it. That incident was ultimately what got the landlord to begin eviction proceedings.",

One lady came over and yelled up to him \"Hey, my kids saw the whole thing, do you want to talk to them\" and he just casually brushes her off.  Then, right after brushing off the witnesses, he starts pitching his rental properties to us because we \"shouldn't be living here\".  \n\nThe guy was my childhood friends dad and he didn't even recognize me.

I had several interesting interactions over the years, including the what is quite possibly the weirdest call I've ever dealt with.\n\nI was closing one Night at a store where a employee took the night off to get plastered and celebrate his birthday, I had the place locked up tight and had just finished everything up and was doing my final inventory sweep before heading out when I heard a quiet tap tap tap from the front window.\n\nI walked over to the window thinking maybe the awning outside had jarred loose again only to find myself face to face with a black clad figure and the most tricked out MP5 I've ever seen. Who proceeded to start yelling at me to get on the ground something I made no bones about doing. \n\nLying 10 feet from the front door I started hearing a thump thump thump as they tried unsuccessful to smash through the reinforced side security door I was next too, before unsuccessfully battering the tempered security Glass and shattering that, Finally one of the geniuses asks \"why don't we ask the asshole to let us in\" and I calmly walk over to the security door and open it... where I'm promptly thrown to the ground, cuffed and hogtied. It's finally at this point that the Police finally identify themselves and demand to know why I've broken into the store.\n\nI am trying to explain to them that I'm the store manager and to which one of them tells me, \"you can't be, I come here every day and he never works the evening.\" Finally some common sense prevails when their sniper who had set up behind the pumps comes up and I recognize him as the truancy officer from my high school days, he proceeds to tell the other nitwits to back off and I'm finally able to figure out what happened.\n\nApparently someone had seen me moving around in the darkened store and assumed I had broken in, called the police, and they brought an entire SWAT team loaded for bear to stop the hardened and obviously armed criminal.\n\nBonus to this the sergeant on the scene was insistent that I be identified by the store owner and had his dispatch try to get in contact with the stores police point of contact... which lead to the awkward situation where said sergent answered the call from his dispatch lieutenant on my phone... while three of his other officers laughed at him.",

He then drove off **leaving his front bumper with his license plate**.   All the cops had to do to identify him was type the license plate number into their system.

I was going straight through a green light and an old lady on the other side decided that was a good time to turn left in front of me. Slammed on the breaks, but she caught me on the front passenger side, twice. Hit me with her front end first as she turned, her back end skidded a bit and hit me again in the same spot... And then she just went on her merry way, didn't even hit the brakes. It was bizarre.  \n\nLuckily, I had a dash cam... but *unluckily* the view of her license plate was just not quite clear enough. But, yet again, luckily, the cop that responded was really kind and watched the video with me over and over again, and then played it at the station for a bunch of her coworkers and they eventually got the plates right. She called me at about 9pm to let me know they got the plates and she went to their house to talk to them, and they admitted they knew they hit me, but \"didn't think they could do anything,\" so she just drove away. Not sure who \"they\" are in this situation, or if she even realized it was 100% her fault. She was 89, and her son said she only drives once a month to get her hair done. Guess that was the day. \n\nAnyway, that was a long-winded way to say that I would've been screwed and responsible to foot the bill for the damage on my 3 month old car, which totalled close to $7k I think, if I got a cop that didn't think it was important enough to do anything but the bare minimum. And that woman wouldn't have been reported to the DMV to retest for her license, risking her killing someone next time, especially considering the accident happened at the intersection of an elementary school that had just let out.\n\nEdit: typos",

If you discharge a firearm at someone, you *better* be intending to kill them because you'll instantly lose a self defense case if you say you were using it as a deterrent. The only justifiable cause for discharging a firearm to defend yourself is if the attacker is an immediate threat to your life (i.e. if you don't kill them, they'll kill you). \"Shooting to injure\" or \"firing a warning shot\" will get you thrown in prison, as it should.",

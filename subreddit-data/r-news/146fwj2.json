                                    "comment": "Another Canadian here,\n\nWhile forest fires do break out at this time of year, the number of fires across Canada at this time of year is extremely alarming and unusual.\n\nThe main reason for forest fires is because of lightning strikes as [roughly half of all forest fires are started by lightning](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6854186).  Lightning as with all extreme weather events has been increasing the last few decades due to climate change, and because of climate change vegetation is more likely to be dryer than in previous decades.\n\nAt the same time, the fires that break out now tend to burn more territory. Overall, the area burned annually by wildland fires has more than doubled since the 1970s, according to a [recent federal report](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/mrgnc-mngmnt/ntnl-rsk-prfl/index-en.aspx).\n\nThat answers why we are having more forest fires every year that are more severe, but doesn\u2019t answer why we are experiencing so many right now in Spring which as I mentioned is extremely unusual.\n\nThe reason we are have a lot of forest fires right now is because the fires started beneath a [well-predicted \u201cheat dome,\u201d](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/06/06/northeast-wildfire-smoke-canada-pollution/#) or zone of high pressure, which brought sinking air and warm, dry conditions that broke records for the time of year and location.\n\nLow pressure swirling clockwise over Nova Scotia, meanwhile, is making for a conveyor belt of northerly winds that is pumping the smoke south over the Great Lakes, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.\n\nAlso it has been incredibly hot this spring, [especially back in April with record breaking temperatures](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2023/04/13/toronto-heat-temperature-records/amp/).\n\nSo it was a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of conditions caused by an unusual weather pattern caused by decades of climate change that created the perfect conditions for forest fires across Canada, and due to other factors caused by climate change has made these fires more extreme and fuelled them as well as spreading their smoke far across areas unaffected by fires.\n\nBe aware that while the current conditions are unusual forest fires will only continue to increase as well as their severity for decades to come even if we stop pumping pollutants into our atmosphere, and we will experience this again in the future.\n\nThings are also going to get worse this year.  Expect an incredibly bad late summer early fall which is peak forest fire season in Canada.",

Yes, fire was common in forests managed by Native communities--but the characteristics of the fires were very different. Old growth forests are much more fire resistant, because trees are spaced much further apart, and there is substantially less undergrowth. Fires that moved through those forests didn't destroy most trees, they just cleared out brush and kept the forests open.\n\nBut because of 150 years of clear cut logging, we fundamentally transformed the forests of the PNW into thick, clogged stands of aged matched trees, with tons of undergrowth. Fires now burn much hotter, and utterly destroy forests, instead of benefiting them. \n\nThe problem is not caused by stopping logging (and there's still a ton of that happening, by the way--I can see active clear cuts from my window right now and trucks full of logs roll down my street daily) it was caused by how we do logging. \n\nWe need to figure out how to restore historic forest structure, so that fires are not as devastating. But we don't really know how to do that, and it might be futile anyway, since climate change is making this region no longer suitable for many of the tree species that have been common here.",

Basically, a couple of things are happening here. The first is that as the planet warms, it's actually the poles that warm the fastest (instead of the equatorial regions, because they are larger and so take longer to heat up - bit of a simplification though). Because the poles are warming, the temperature/density gradient between the equator is decreasing, which means the jetstream, which likes to travel around the globe between the [polar and ferrel cells of the atmosphere](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/07/cells.jpg), is no longer held in place, and is behaving more erratically, meandering in unusual ways. It usually brings cold air with it when it bends down over the US, like when Texas froze and the electrical grid failed.   \n  This summer the reverse is happening. The jetstream is far to the north (more so than the normal summer movement) and there's a high pressure system just sitting smack dab over most of Canada. Canada's average temperature has risen about 2 degrees Celsius in the past 20 years, so the forests have slowly been drying out already (hot air holds more moisture, which means trees have to evaporatranspirate faster to supply their upper cells with water). This latest dry spell is just too hot for too long and its causing the forests to become dangerously dry. It's estimated that 3.3 million hectares of forest have burned - more than 12 times the average fire season for the past decade. And its only June.  \n   \n  This is just another in a very long list of disturbing warning signs that we are tipping the planet into a radical new era of climate change. This is not the 1980's pause, this is the engine revving.  \n  \n  If we don't fundamentally change the way we as a society and a species interact with the natural systems that sustain us, the rest of our lives will make all the wars of the past 200 years look like a walk in the park. It honestly may already be too late. When entire regions of the world become physically unlivable due to heat extremes, the current stage of political stability - that is already teetering - will fall into absolute chaos. We're talking the migration of billions of people - and all the misery that entails. The sheer amount of human suffering will be astounding. I honestly think we will be lucky if less than a billion people die.",

Imagine what kind of brutal things humans will do to each other for potable water and food.... Think of the way nations across the globe already treat refugees. Now imagine how bad it will get when the refugee numbers grow exponentially because large swaths of the globe aren't really liveable anymore.",

Trees sequester the most carbon in the first 8 years of their life, so regenerating forests is actually a good thing for greenhouse gas sequestration.",

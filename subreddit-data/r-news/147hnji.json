It's easier to feel anger than to feel what's underneath, like disappointment, fear, jealousy, resentment, violation etc. Too many people are walking around angry all the time because they can't or won't understand what's under that anger. Once they understand there's something else there they can then start to label their emotions. Once they can do that they can start to process those emotions and put strategies in place. I'm sick of society making excuses for angry people hurting and killing others, it's time we taught emotional regulation from early childhood and expected that adults take responsibility and learn to regulate themselves.",

None of those areas *ever* got as bad as 80s/ 90s Oakland but decades of unaffordable housing has pushed people out, bit by bit. They ended up more spread out, in new areas. Less conflict between rival gangs due to less contact.\n\nStill ended up with some of those issues spilling out. Antioch got bad for a bit. So has Pittsburg. Both have been worse than statewide for a bit. Antioch has gotten better since the spike about 10 years ago. Pittsburg has gotten worse.\n\nNeither are as bad as Oakland or Stockton, but neither are considered super safe cities, either.\n\nI'm guessing idiots with warped notions of respect and loyalty over gang affiliations are at play.\n\nCould be a run of the mill crazy asshole.

He was a bigger kind of intimidating dude so he volunteered to kick them out. He told them firmly to leave and the randos didn\u2019t respond well to that. It escalated to a shouting match and then out of nowhere one of the guys drew a knife and slashed our friends throat in front of the whole crowd of onlookers.\n\nEveryone freaked out and the randos fled the scene. Our friend survived but to my knowledge they never caught the randos. This was back in 2008 or so when people weren\u2019t filming everything all the time and no one at the party knew them.\n\nAnyway my point is, this kind of thing can totally happen.",

After all, they make each other a lot of money. Could it be that Tucker wants to strike out on his own? Maybe, but he would be leaving a large chunk of his audience behind, maybe even most of it.\n\n\"Could it be that Fox asked him to leave? It seems strange that they would. After all, Tucker is their highest-rated host, again making Fox a lot of money. So, if they did fire him, it would have to be for something serious.\n\n\"Very serious. Like, 'eating babies' serious. Not that I'm saying Tucker is *known* for eating babies... no one has accused him of that, as far as I know. But he makes Fox a lot of money, enough that those suitably focused on the bottom line might overlook the occasional baby... as long as it wasn't an *important* baby. Maybe poor babies would be okay, but definitely not ones with rich parents.\n\n\"Of course, nobody is saying Tucker Carlson is a baby-eating cannibal. In fact, we don't even know that he was fired. Not for certain, in any case. But it does make you wonder... how many babies would Tucker Carlson have to eat before Fox News fired him? Neither Fox nor Tucker have said, so we may never know.\"",

This man has singlehandedly turned my father and myself against one another and has made my grandmother go from a sweet, feisty, funny lady who was proud of me to an angry, paranoid, unintelligent-sounding sourpuss who hates everything about me that she used to find admirable. They both used to be proud that I was a successful independent woman, but now they're both disappointed that I'm not some godly broodmare who serves a good Christian man. You see, I'm the kind of woman Tucker ranted about hating the most (late 30s, childless, unmarried, educated, career focused, and left). \n\nThis asshole reset their brains anytime I was able to talk any sense into them. All it took was one episode and you could almost see them getting their dopamine hits from the rage-bait while they watched. Tucker brought out the absolute worst in them and turned them into extra-bigoted shells of their former selves. I can't say more than two sentences to my dad without him saying some inappropriate bigoted or political crap, and my dad used to not like to discuss politics. Now culture was stuff is all he can think about. \n\nSorry for the little rant. I'm sure tucker will find some other place to spew his poison, and that his replacement will be even worse, but I could use a balm.",

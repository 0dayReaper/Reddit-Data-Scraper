EPA was established in 1970 as the beginning of the environmental movement and the science showing the damage were both coming to the fore.",

Hunting, fishing, swimming in lakes, a lot of conservatives\u2013both rural and urban\u2013just love those kind of activities.\n\nSo why are a good chunk of conservatives also largely in complete denial of climate change, in favor of rollbacks on environmental regulations, and generally okay with massive destruction of the environment? I\u2019m not totally sure; I know a lot of conservatives in my family who are exactly like this, and in every conversation I\u2019ve had they call these things hoaxes, claim the environmental effects are overblown, mention how it hurts businesses, and point to their anecdotal experiences (\u201cWell the sky is still blue, the fish are still in the water, and the deer are still there to hunt.\u201d) \n\nBecause my conversations don\u2019t get far enough to get to the roots of why they are like this, I truly don\u2019t know. My best guess is that throughout the upbringing to present day they have been endlessly drip-fed propaganda by people like Rush Limbaugh (Side note: AM radio has played a much bigger role in the brain rot than people realize), Fox News, and their own bubble that continuously reinforces this ideas. I imagine the process goes like this: \nDo liberals believe in climate change? Yes. Is climate change bad? Yes -&gt; Therefore climate change must be a hoax! \nDo liberals like environmental regulation? Yes -&gt; therefore it must be bad!\n\nEtc etc.",

Those places you are fishing are not your own private land, they are collective, public land/water which is under the protection of the state. The state can either choose to tax everybody to protect, maintain, and clean up the area, or they can charge only the individuals who use that land, or they can do a mix of both. \n\nThat people have been doing something for a long time is an absolutely irrelevant argument. If we want these places to be upheld to a certain standard it takes the above-mentioned protection, maintenance, and recovery efforts of our state agencies. Trust me dude, those people are not rich.\n\nJust pay your tags/registration, enjoy your time there, and rest easy knowing you are helping to make sure these areas are pristine for the younger fishermen/ hunters of the next generation.",

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

Doesn't necessarily end as well as this.\n\nIt's not just the Rocky Mountains and the High Sierras that are dangerous. Even experienced hikers get trapped in the less famous ranges.\n\nFor instance, Irish hiker David O'Sullivan vanished while hiking the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail). There's no evidence of foul play but [he's never been found](https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/mystery-remains-over-irish-man-26739358). The last firm evidence of his whereabouts is his signature in a register at the mountain community of Idyllwild in 2017. O'Sullivan was no novice: he had trained for the journey hiking the tallest peak in Ireland. He was healthy, in great condition, mid-twenties. Yet Mount San Jacinto, the next peak on the PCT above Idyllwild, is three times taller than Carrauntoohil.\n\nTo give a perspective on that, the San Jacinto Range is pretty far south: between Disneyland and Palm Springs on the map, yet it's tall enough that the peaks had deep snows in mid-April. O'Sullivan probably had an accident either there or on the even taller San Bernardino Range on the next leg of the trail. These are geologically active ranges with steep slopes and deep ravines. A hiker can lose footing on rocks, loose soil, ice, or snow and get a broken leg without a way to scramble back up. There are several rescues in those ranges each season. But it's protected land where drones need special clearance (issued after specific evidence) to run search flights. So the searches for O'Sullivan have been conducted on foot. There's a team of volunteers still looking and hoping to provide his family some closure.\n\n(edited to correct a typo)\n\n----\n\nTo clarify, in the range where this hiker disappeared it's possible to go missing without ever making a choice to leave the trail. The main escarpment is the steepest in the lower 48 states and these mountains are undergoing active uplift and erosion. People who keep to the established trails still slip in the snow or step on a spot that gives way. If a hiker loses footing just once and has nothing to grab onto, they can end up injured in a gully with no way to escape or communicate.\n\nA well prepared hiker may perform first aid, use a space blanket, and sip reserve water while using signals. Yet if no one hears their whistle and if tree cover conceals their emergency strobe--it's a bad situation. The rangers require people to register their intended route and most hikers also leave a record of their intended plans with friends, which helps. Yet particularly bad luck occasionally overcomes the best precautions.",

Geographically it's all North America yet underneath, the tallest peaks of both sets of ranges occur at a region where a corner the Pacific tectonic plate is jabbing into the North American Plate, uplifting fault blocks from granitic rock that was formed from a long-dead volcanic chain that used to be active about 80 million years ago.\n\n&gt;  [In slightly less than seven horizontal miles the peak rises from 800 to 10,834 feet above sea level, creating the steepest escarpment in the continental U.S. No other mountain in the lower 48 states rises so high so fast, not even the Sierra Nevada or Grand Tetons.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/06/27/san-jacinto-peak-mountains-geology/2464773/)\n\nThe end result for the San Jacinto range is damn brittle, as mountains go.

I was born in the Cascades.\n\nThere is absolutely zero comparison.\n\nThe tallest of peaks in the British Isles is a moderately challenging day hike in the Cascades. Hell, there are CASUAL day hikes in the Cascades that are as high as the very highest peaks in the British Isles. The highest mountains there are the mountain PASSES in the Cascades. In fact, the tallest mountain in Ireland is barely higher than the elevation of the lowest mountain pass in the Cascades (Snoqualmie: 3022 ft. Carrauntoohil: 3406 ft.) And the Rockies are even more rugged. Don't get me started on Alaska.\n\nThe American West is no joke. If you're from just about anywhere else in the world other than the Alps or the Himalayas, double-check your version of a \"mountain\" before thinking about mountaineering out here. Because trust me, if you think you're ready? You aren't.",

I\u2019ve spent much of my life devoted to climbing and skiing in the North Cascades, and I\u2019ve spent the majority of my time, both professionally and recreationally, surrounded by other people who are similarly involved. And I\u2019ve been in and around a lot of professional organizations that operate in the mountains. And I\u2019m telling you that no one in Washington\u2019s mountain community would refer to Cle Elum or Snoqualmie Pass as being in the North Cascades. I\u2019m not going to argue about it any further.",

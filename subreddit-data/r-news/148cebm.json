I can't imagine why any lawyer/firm would work unpaid facing possible severe reputation damage.",

Because of this, particularly on long cases (particularly with clients they don't think will pay), lawyers will want to be paid up front before appearing in court. It was their conjecture that this is why his previous lawyers left the case. They wanted to be paid up front, and Trump didn't want to pay them.",

Do not post on social media. As far as the rest of the world, your friends, family? The only thing you have to say about this is \"I have a lawyer who is handling this and I'm not supposed to talk about it\"\"\n\nTrump can't fundraise on that, or keep his profile high while *shutting up*, even if he was mentally capable of it. \n\nThere's also the nice kicker that too many of his lawyers are ending up *named in indictments*, and a skilled lawyer isn't going to want to work to a client who gets bright ideas like \"What if you and me team up to break the law some more\" and sometimes just starts it and doesn't tell you and suddenly the FBI is interviewing *you*, which means *you need a pricey lawyer*.",

NY judge and prosecutor have been getting death threats, because of all the crap he's been saying.  Read that since this is federal court a lot of that will *not* be tolerated and if he does, he can be held in contempt.  Presently the judge in this case should recuse herself based on the poor judgement she made in her last case.  This Newsweek article portion sums it up nicely...\n\n&gt; To be clear, our concern is not that Judge Cannon is a Trump appointee. The conflict of interest is that she has already issued unusual and profoundly wrong decisions favoring the defendant in this case that have been severely criticized and overturned, again by conservative or Trump-appointed judges\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/trump-judge-aileen-cannon-recusal-classified-documents-1805939",

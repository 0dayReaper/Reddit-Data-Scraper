Though I don't think my classmates got matched with the girls from the Christian girls only school for their confirmation.\n\nThankfully my parents never were strongly catholic, my dad specially was very separated from anything religion related, and with time, they have become less religious, so they had no problem when I came out as agnostic (and ultimately atheist) and when I didn't want to get confirmed.\n\nOne of my most vivid memories of a horror story from that school was in 3rd grade where our religion teacher was talking about our first communion, but it ended up going down into a rambling about masturbation making you unable to enjoy sex ever again and that Ricky Martin and Justin Bieber were, and I quote, \"sissy f-ggots\". **This was when we were in 3rd grade.**\n\nAlso, later on another teacher giving us the (very little) sex Ed that we had, talking about how emergency pills were bad because they could kill a *fetus* (which isn't true because if anything it might kill an embryo, not a fetus) and not touching on the fact that emergency pills are like  hormonal bomb. And that condoms were bad because some had spermicides.",

The waters are rising fast.\"\n\n\"No,\" says the preacher. \"I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.\"\n\nStill the waters rise. Now the preacher is up on the balcony, wringing his hands in supplication, when another guy zips up in a motorboat.\n\n\"Come on, Preacher. We need to get you out of here. The levee's gonna break any minute.\"\n\nOnce again, the preacher is unmoved. \"I shall remain. The Lord will see me through.\"\n\nAfter a while the levee breaks, and the flood rushes over the church until only the steeple remains above water. The preacher is up there, clinging to the cross, when a helicopter descends out of the clouds, and a state trooper calls down to him through a megaphone.\n\n\"Grab the ladder, Preacher. This is your last chance.\"\n\nOnce again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.\n\nAnd, predictably, he drowns.\n\nA pious man, the preacher goes to heaven. After a while he gets an interview with God, and he asks the Almighty, \"Lord, I had unwavering faith in you. Why didn't you deliver me from that flood?\"\n\nGod shakes his head. \"What did you want from me? I sent you two boats and a helicopter.\"",

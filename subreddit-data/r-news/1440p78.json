Chuck Berry is even worse.\n\nBut I think it is a double-standard.  While people call out Elvis, do people actually call him a pedophile?   He was dating someone that is illegal in every state in present day.  But it wasn't really legal for his time either - only one state had an age of consent under 16 (Georgia at 14), but the states were split about 50/50 on 16 vs 18.",

I just think that double-standard goes both ways, with places like reddit doing the opposite. \n\nI think we need to acknowledge across the board that people can do go, while also having the capacity to do fucked up things. We shouldn't white wash our heroes, or hold them to lower standards than we'd hold others.",

Statistically speaking, the average age of first marriage has never dipped below the early 20s at any point since the 1890s, and the average age difference between spouses has remained constant at approximately 2 years difference since then as well. Now, if you are talking about extremely impoverished, extremely rural areas, then things might look different. But in most of the US, no, it absolutely was not normal in the 1960s for someone in their 30s to marry a 16 year old. Or date a 16 year old. It was considered creepy and weird then too. In the modern day, you also see people in high places taking advantage of underage kids, and it was no different in the 60s, but that doesn't mean it was seen as a normal thing by most of the country.",

Gay men were taking in 16 year olds because getting kicked out by your parents was so common that it became a support system we created to SURVIVE. \n\nSo yeah, sure they\u2019re both bad but for some reason marrying 13 year old girls to get them started breeding earlier seems so much more evil to me.",

And where they do exist they have to keep it really quiet and completely to themselves. Everything. Dating rituals. Courtship. Everything you know about straight life. It's not in pop songs or movies or pop culture openly *at all*. The only way you have any sense of shared history or passing of knowledge is person-to-person. In a situation like that you can imagine intergenerational relationships becoming much more a thing, by necessity even.    \n\nIm neither defending nor decrying Milk's relationship. But I think there is perhaps more there than brazenly just wanting a younger partner.",

I don't think a 16 year old can consent to that, but the coercion is clearly not as bad as forcible rape of a 6 year old. Both should face punishment, but the one with the 6 year old should face harsher punishment. I'm not saying there isn't room for nuance. I'm saying people commonly understand the term pedophile in public discourse to be an older perpetrator who is attracted to minors.",

It is if you accept the lies and propaganda from the anti-American Left in our own country. This dismal, distorted view of the greatest, freest nation in history comes from a Left who would rather idolize Ho Chi Minh and Fidel Castro than honor George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who burn down businesses and destroy property to protest free markets, and who fight alongside radical terrorists rather than against them. They trample the Constitution while hiding behind the First Amendment, and their idea of displaying the American flag is setting it on fire and parading it through the streets. Yes, this is a Left comprised of people who truly hate their country, and they will stop at nothing to tear her down\u2014smashing our liberty in the process.\u201d\n\nWe can discuss how problematic Milk\u2019s relationship is with a 16 year old without bringing questionable BS into it.",

Days later, Harvey Milk, one of America's first openly gay elected officials--and a vocal supporter of Jim Jones--is assassinated in San Francisco's City Hall. Almost immediately, the lives and deaths of Jim Jones and Harvey Milk became shrouded in myth.

The rest  (a majority of the country) have an age of consent at 16. (I am referring is the the general age not restricted by age of parter. This age may still have restrictions on if the older partner is in a position of authority over the younger one.)\n\nOf course that absolutely does not change it being weird and gross for a 20+ year old to sleep a 16 year old. It obviously very much is. It simply means it isn\u2019t technically a crime in most of the country.\n\nI\u2019m honestly not sure why the age of consent is that low in most of the country, when 18 and a close-in-age exception would cover basically any relationship that does not seem horrifyingly wrong to most of the country.  I can only assume that there must be some groups who push back heavily on any proposal to raise the age of consent (much like there are apparently groups that push back heavily on proposed laws not allowing an adult to marry a child below the age of consent).",

It's certainly uncomfortable that he dated younger men, but A) older men dating and marrying much younger women was more common in that time, too. Milk was born in 1930. And B) At the time in New York, the hard and fast age of consent was 14. Also C) other people don't get that same accusation if they were in a heterosexual relationship. Elvis Presley met a then 14 year old Priscilla. They saw each other constantly when he was in his 20's and she was 14/15 years old. She traveled to the US to visit him at 17. They did drugs together. She moved in with his parents a few blocks away from him while in high school. Left to the US to live with him. However, it's pretty well known she'd actually moved into Graceland.\n\nNobody calls him a pedophile for that.\n\nBo Derek was 16 when she met John Derek who was 30 years her senior and stayed in Europe with him to avoid statutory rape laws in California. Eventually, they got married. Stayed married until he died. Nobody does the same for John Derek.\n\nDon Johnson was 22 to a 14 year old Melanie Griffith. He doesn't get called a pedophile.\n\nThere's certainly some elements of the 'Milk was a pedophile' statement that are related to his being a gay man when you look at his contemporaries and even people coming later who *aren't* called pedophiles.\n\nWould that relationship be wildly inappropriate today? Yes. Did it make Milk a pedophile then? No. But he isn't alive today, and it was not only legal but far more acceptable (for heterosexual men) to openly have those age gaps. The age wasn't the issue then. It was the gay part.\n\nHistorical context is important when judging whether his conduct was inappropriate *for his time.* No, no man should be dating a 16 year old boy today. Of course not. But back then... those age gaps were seen more often. Men wouldn't start dating until being established in careers and for some reason, not infrequently looked to 16 year olds. Not their own age. Why? I have no idea. But it was common of his time.\n\nGiven straight men don't get the accusation, it's left me to question why they call Milk one.",

Particularly since some of the verbiage here feels like they're trying to tie it into present day culture war nonsense, although that could be a coincidence.   \n\nOn a separate note, I'm not aware of Kinsey being revered or taken particularly seriously nowadays -- sort of like the first generation of psychotherapists or field anthropologists, I think he's appreciated for expanding the world of what could be studied and breaking down some preconceptions, but I don't think anyone seriously thinks that his methods were scientifically valid or that his data is usable.",

Her claims about Kinsey and the sexual abuse of children have been pretty thoroughly refuted by the Kinsey institute: https://web.archive.org/web/20140212143625/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/cont-akchild.html\n\nWhile the ethics of his methodology are worth scrutinizing, and he was for sure a creep in other ways, there's no evidence that he was a pedophile, that he molested children, or that he encouraged others to molest children.\n\nEdit: This kinda stuck in my craw so I went and read the relevant part of the Kinsey Report. In his effort to obfuscate his sources, Kinsey certainly makes it sound like he was abusing children or directing children to be abused for research. So I really get where Dr. Reisman is coming from, and I'm not sure how I feel about the Institute's refutation. His study either abused children or used and misrepresented garbage data and I hope it's the latter.",

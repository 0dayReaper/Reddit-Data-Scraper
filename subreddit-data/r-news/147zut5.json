The driver was probably familiar with exit as he was making a local delivery of gasoline which are done routinely. It was 6:30 am on a Sunday and traffic in that section routinely goes 15 to 20 mph over the 55 mph posted limit. My guess he made a bad decision when reaching that downhill exit and came in much too fast. \n\nSource-Been driving that section of I-95 since 1974.",

It\u2019s a truck crash, and as any urbanist will tell you, vehicles crashing are almost never accidents. They\u2019re always preventable.",

Hopefully authorities are more forthcoming soon, including the background of the driver. Even assuming it was an accident (ie. taking the ramp too fast), it highlights the vulnerability of the highway system, which may also explain the limited release of information by authorities and news media.",

The incident (even if simply an accident, such as driving too fast) shows how vulnerable the highway system is and its various chokepoints.

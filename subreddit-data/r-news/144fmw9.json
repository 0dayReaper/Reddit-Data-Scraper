Sort of a pictorial version of all the \"extinct\" animals as a sort of way to preserve them like Noah did, but without the animals. There is no reason to believe this is true, but it was a fun thought. It will be exciting to find out more about the culture that built it.",

            "comment": "Article:\n\nResearchers have uncovered evidence that members of a mysterious archaic human species buried their dead and carved symbols on cave walls long before the earliest evidence of burials by modern humans.\n\nThe brains belonging to the extinct species, known as Homo naledi, were around one-third the size of a modern human brain.\n\nThe revelations could change the understanding of human evolution, because until now such behaviors only have been associated with larger-brained Homo sapiens and Neanderthals.\n\nThe findings are detailed in three studies that have been accepted for publication in the journal eLife, and preprints of the papers are available on BioRxiv.\n\nFossils belonging to Homo naledi were first discovered in the Rising Star cave system in South Africa during excavations in 2013. The cave system is part of South Africa\u2019s Cradle of Humankind, a UNESCO World Heritage Site encompassing an area where scientists have found fossils of multiple ancient human ancestor species \u2014 remains that are helping to unlock the story of human evolution.\n\nPaleoanthropologist and National Geographic Explorer in Residence Dr. Lee Berger and his team of \u201cunderground astronauts\u201d have continued their work in the extensive, dangerous caves to better understand the extinct hominins, or ancient human ancestors.\n\nNow, the research team has discovered the remains of Homo naledi adults and children that were laid to rest in the fetal position within cave depressions and covered with soil. The burials are older than any known Homo sapiens burials by at least 100,000 years.\n\nDuring the work to identify the cave burials, the scientists also found a number of symbols engraved on the cave walls, which are estimated to be between 241,000 and 335,000 years old, but they want to continue their testing for more precise dating.\n\nThe symbols include deeply carved hashtag-like cross-hatchings and other geometric shapes. Similar symbols found in other caves were carved by early Homo sapiens 80,000 years ago and Neanderthals 60,000 years ago and were thought to have been used as a way to record and share information.\n\n\u201cThese recent findings suggest intentional burials, the use of symbols, and meaning-making activities by Homo naledi. It seems an inevitable conclusion that in combination they indicate that this small-brained species of ancient human relatives was performing complex practices related to death,\u201d said Berger, lead author on two of the studies and coauthor on the third, in a statement. \u201cThat would mean not only are humans not unique in the development of symbolic practices, but may not have even invented such behaviors.\u201d",

But, I think an important part of that, though, is that the journey would not be nearly as difficult, I think, for Homo naledi.\u201d\n\nHomo naledi shared some similarities with humans, like walking upright and manipulating objects by hand, but members of the species had smaller heads, a shorter stature, and were thinner and more powerfully built, Berger said.\n\nHomo naledi\u2019s shoulders \u2014 which were oriented for better climbing \u2014 and teeth shared similarities with earlier hominins like Australopithecus, said Dr. John Hawks, professor of anthropology and paleoanthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nThe researchers have found many Homo naledi fossils throughout the caves, including the remains of very young infants and aged adults, to help them understand Naledi as a population, Hawks said. And as the team continued deeper into the caves, it became clear that Homo naledi was very familiar with and using broad parts of the cave system.\n\nWhen Berger and his team announced the discovery of Homo naledi in 2015, they suggested it was possible that the species deliberately disposed of their dead in the cave.\n\nBut the idea of a small-brained hominin doing so was considered to be a very controversial hypothesis.\n\nIn 2018, the team began to find evidence that supported the idea that Homo naledi intentionally buried their dead. The scientists found ovals dug into cave surfaces resembling holes, and the remains of bodies placed inside in curled positions.\n\nOther burial sites were dug horizontally into slopes, with bodies placed inside, showing that the remains didn\u2019t end up there by other, nondeliberate means, Berger said.",

                            "comment": "\u201cIt\u2019s not a body that died in a depression or hole. It was a whole body that was covered in dirt and then decayed within the grave itself, in part demonstrating that it was buried at the time as a whole flesh entity, but not by some dramatic collapse or being washed in,\u201d Berger said. \u201cWe feel that they\u2019ve met the litmus test of human burials or archaic human burials and the most ancient human burials, and therefore describe them as graves or burials by the nonhuman species, Homo naledi.\u201d\n\nAnd then, the team found an artifact within a burial and discovered carvings on the wall.\n\n**Carvings on the wall**\n\nWithin one of the graves is a tool-shaped rock, buried next to the hand of a Homo naledi adult. Within a passage above the burials, in an antechamber, is a wall covered with rock engravings.\n\nThe deeply carved geometric shapes appear on dolomite rock walls that reach 4.5 to 4.7 on Mohs Hardness Scale, which helps researchers assess the scratch resistance of minerals. Dolomite is halfway to a diamond (at the top of the scale) in terms of hardness, which means it would have taken an extreme amount of time and effort to carve into the walls, Berger said.\n\nThe team believes that Homo naledi, and not Homo sapiens, are responsible for the carvings because there is no evidence that humans have ever been inside the caves.\n\nHomo naledi was able to see what they were doing inside the caves by using fire. There is evidence spread throughout the caves, including soot, charcoal and burnt bone, to show that they were actively setting fires, Berger said.\n\nBoth the burials and the symbols imply that Homo naledi was capable of engaging in meaningful behaviors, said Agust\u00edn Fuentes, National Geographic Explorer, on-site biocultural specialist and lead author of the third study.\n\nThe meaning of the symbols is unclear, and researchers can\u2019t say whether they were used as a type of language or communication within the species.\n\n\u201cWhat we can say is that these are intentionally made geometric designs that had meaning for naledi,\u201d Fuentes said. \u201cThat means they spent a lot of time and effort and risked their lives to engrave these things in these places where they\u2019re burying bodies.\u201d\n\nThe naledi findings suggest that larger brains can\u2019t be the only connection with complex behavior that researchers once assumed related only to humans, Fuentes said.\n\n\u201cThe challenge here, then, is that we now know that Homo naledi, in addition to Homo sapiens and Neanderthals and Denisovans and a few others, were engaging in the kind of behavior that we, even just a few decades ago, thought was unique to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we need to rethink the timing of fire use, of meaning-making and of the burial of the dead in hominin history.\u201d",

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephant's foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same elephant.",

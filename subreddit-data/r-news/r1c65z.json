            "comment": "&gt; The murder, in the neighbourhood of Satilla Shores, was initially overlooked by most national media outlets until video of shooting, filmed by Bryan, was leaked and made public. The case was assigned to three separate local district attorneys, one of whom recommended not bringing charges against the men, before state investigators intervened after release of the footage. Charges were brought almost three months after Arbery was murdered.\n\nMost important paragraph of the article. These guys almost got off scot free.",

Bryan drove his truck after Arbery and boxed him in, and as a result Arbery couldn\u2019t get away while the McMichaels attacked him. \n\nThe felony murder that Bryan was not guilty of was related to the aggravated assault, because Bryan stayed in his truck and filmed. He didn\u2019t do the aggravated assault. Makes sense, right? You have to be doing a felony while someone dies as a result, no matter whether you intended for that to happen or were the one who actually did the killing.\n\nMalice murder is akin to intentional murder (similar to 1st degree in other states but with a lower bar of premeditation) meaning there was some sort of deliberate intent to kill. Bryan didn\u2019t even leave his truck, and there was no evidence presented during trial to suggest that he intended for Arbery to die at any point. Certainly not to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.\n\nI think the jury got each charge basically 100% right, but a few of them probably shouldn\u2019t have been brought in the first place.\n\nEdit: if you want to get nerdy, [here\u2019s the statute.](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2014/title-16/chapter-5/article-1/section-16-5-1)",

Hence why the cameraman started hitting up any news outlet that would listen with his \"I'm a good boy with a camera\" angle. During the trial even more was put out in the hopes of nailing it home. Its not uncommon for defendants charged together to break up and retain different attorneys if the plan becomes every-man-for-himself.",

Quote from the cop training us, \"without fighting for the gun there's a 100% chance of getting shot, so if fighting means you only have a 99% chance that's still more of a chance than you had before.\"\n\nAhmaud Arbery was forced into a last ditch effort. The \"inexplicable\" reason was he tried everything else to get away from the armed men in trucks who were chasing him, and he did what he thought was best for his chance of survival.\n\nI doubt the defense attorney would understand the mentality of someone being hunted. If you've only ever been a predator it's not easy to think like the prey.",

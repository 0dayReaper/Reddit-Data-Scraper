They knew they were supposed to register with the SEC and comply with certain regulations around operating a securities exchange. Senior management chose to not comply with the law. \n\nThis has nothing to do with the novelty of crypto. Just because you\u2019re a new fancy tech does not mean the old rules are suddenly gone. By your logic I could argue that crypto exchanges should be free to discriminate against protected classes because the law protecting against discrimination was written about *banking* and not specifically crypto. Come on man, get a grip. As an aside, I think it\u2019s ironic how the crypto community slowly rediscovers all the lessons from 19th century banking that led us to the centralized system we use today.",

This information enables investors, not the government, to make informed judgments about whether to invest in a company's securities. Here\u2019s an overview of how the registration process works. In general, all securities offered in the United States must be registered with the SEC or must qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements. The registration forms a company files with the SEC provide significant information, including:\n\n&gt; * A description of the company's properties and business;\n&gt; * A description of the security to be offered for sale;\n&gt; * Information about the management of the company; and\n&gt; * Financial statements certified by independent accountants.\n\nNone of that is impossible for a crypto exchange to provide. His quote is ridiculous - how can it be that Coinbase doesn't know the answers to these questions? Last I checked, industry doesn't get to make demands of regulators so the idea of them saying \"clear up these issues and then maybe we'll register \\*teehee\\*\" is absurd. Coinbase is playing games because they don't want regulatory scrutiny. \n\nI work in the insurance industry, which is very highly regulated. I wouldn't dream of making such demands of a regulator - that kind of behavior is a problem. \n\n&gt;So without the Supreme Court ruling on it or Congress passing a law specifically for crypto, we're in a limbo state where Gary Gensler gets to decide what is and isn't legal.\n\nFirst of all, the Supreme Court has already ruled on it. You just cited the case - there's a test and everything! Here are the 3 requirements:\n\n&gt;The first criterion is a financial investment, which means that participants in the transaction must be risking their own money. This comprises both financial and in-kind investments.\n\n&gt;The second requirement is a shared enterprise, which denotes that the financial success of the investors is somehow connected. This can be proven by providing evidence of the investors\u2019 resource pooling or reliance on a third party to manage their investments.\n\n&gt;The third criterion is an expectation of profits solely from the efforts of others, which means that the investors are relying on someone else to generate a return on their investment. This could include, for example, profits generated by a third-party manager or profits generated by the efforts of a particular group or organization.\n\nYou're implicitly making the argument that *all* crypto fails the test and shouldn't be regulated. But if a single token satisfies all 3 requirements then these exchanges are breaking the law. As the quote up top says, management clearly knows that at least 1 token on the platform is a security.",

Mainly since we speak in totally different magnitudes of scale.\n\nI work with spreadsheet with **thousands** of rows of data with tens to hundreds of columns. It is easier and quicker to learn to do simple VBA or python scripts to process this than to do it manually. (Which mind you as a mechanical engineer who's speciality is in practical side of things, is not in my realm of knowledge or interests).\n\nWhen I have to track weld filler use and batch IDs for ISO standardised documentation for a project that can span year or two along with who what and when. The sheer volume of data along with other duties I might have at the same time makes this impossibly impractical and inefficient.\n\nHowever if I could just tell an AI via my phone to add this and that to the sheet, then also give me answer to what and who with a simple chat message to my own computer. I would be able to focus on doing engineering and not data entry. And I have very little interest in becoming a software developer so I can do my job properly - especially when I am not paid to do such development work.",

Do you wanna know why global adoption can't happen? Because if even a quarter of the world fully adopted Bitcoin for all their currency needs, the power needed to operate the network would start to exceed the global supply of ALL the energy produced by the world.\n\nFortunately, Bitcoin is so shitty it can't handle more than 7 transactions per second. Our salvation from Bitcoin's apocalyptic energy consumption is it's insanely shitty throughput ...\n\nBut yes tell me more about how Bitcoin is the future of finance lol",

For these reasons:\n\n1) There's probably 5 people in the entire world who have a need for transferring billions between countries.\n2) You ignore all of the onboarding and offboarding costs. You are not sending 2Bn USD without this.\n3) The difficulty of transferring between countries isn't technological it is legislative. You are ignoring of the legal requirements of source and destination country - which all adds costs.\n4) Bitcoin is limited to 7 transactions per second. Good luck onboarding anyone other than your single lone Billionaire.\n\n&gt;Yes, I'm aware. New sectors, whether they survive or not, are inherently speculative.\n\nIt's not new.

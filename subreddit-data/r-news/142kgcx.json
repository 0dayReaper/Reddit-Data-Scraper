Yes, most people can be fairly easily categorised as either male.or female in a biological/genetic/anatomical sense. But it's also true that for some people this isn't true, the different markers of sex usually all align, but not always. Now if this slight simplification into two sexes wasn't constantly weaponized to trample on the rights of those who don't neatly fit into the categories you and people like you prefer then everyone, including LGBTQ people of all stripes might be ok with it. But of course it is weaponized, it is used to trample on people. Which means that people have to get pedantic about, pretty much as literal self defense. People die over this shit.\n\nAnd yes, it's also true that, regardless of one's gender, society treats people in certain ways according to their sex (previous paragraph applies here of course) and that therefore, in a sociocultural sense, male people live, effectively, as men and female people as women. They experience the privileges, advantages and disadvantages and just general life experiences that the world heaps on people of a certain sex. In that way there can be a distinction between a trans woman and a cis woman. Both might be women but they have some very different experiences and struggles behind them. This, again, is something that would probably receive a lot less pushback if it wasn't constantly abused to pour abuse on trans people, prevent them from participating in daily life as who they are and, in the final consequence driving some of them into desperation,.even to the point of suicide.\n\nOr in short, yes, facts are facts and they don't care about our feelings, but if you use them to harm, harass and indirectly kill people it's your own fault.if the discussion turns emotional.\n\nEdit: I meant to reply to the coward who deleted their comment. Not you! Sorry!",

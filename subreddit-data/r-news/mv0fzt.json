(And probably several other things.)\n\nSpecifically in this case manslaughter means the officer acted negligently and the result was a death. Second degree murder means that the officer intended to cause harm and it resulted in death.\n\nThe judge, however, in sentencing can stack the prison time so it is served concurrently. It doesn't mean (though it can) that the sentences are served consecutively.\n\nEDIT: INAL but to give example on how this isn't a single act I'll add the following.\n\n I don't know the prosecutor's argument nor the jury's reasoning, but it could be something like this.\n\nChauvin  assaulted Floyd by intentionally using a painful and violent method of  restraint. This act was intentional and could meet the qualifications  for assault and for second-degree murder.\n\nAs  Floyd was continuing to be restrained and displaying signs of distress,  Chauvin should have known to release Floyd or change his restraint  technique. This later act (failure to act) is negligence but not  intended to cause any harm.\n\nIt looks like one act but in reality it is a series of on going decisions.",

Going to test if the phone MUST be unlocked first, I don't think that's the case but I'll find out.

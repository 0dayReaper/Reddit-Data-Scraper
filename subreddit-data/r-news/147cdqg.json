It's bordered countries are already on alert. It doesn't even have a border with Isra\u00ebl so good luck on that. \n\nNorth Korea will be quiet because Kimmy KNOWS he cannot fight a war without losing. Definetly not against the entire NATO.

That would take them a long time to get it up to that point, a week+, and it would be detectable the second they started trying.. but, with the retention pond apparently draining as fast as it is, I don't even think they could get it up to that point if allowed to try it... \n\nAnd they wouldn't be allowed. I'm quite certain that that's the reason the 101st Airborne is hanging out in eastern Europe. So yeah, there's a group available near there totally capable of preventing it, and if they had any suspicion that was in the works it would be stopped.",

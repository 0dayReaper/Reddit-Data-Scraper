Or it is more like Pussy but it is a \"harder\" word closer to Cunt in the US.\n\n\"Exposed their vagina\" makes it sound so professional, the original Swedish does not lol. More like \"Shown their cunt.\"",

It caught cisgender athletes &amp; left them in a limbo where the people organizing the game would try to force players to retire because they \"belonged\" in no category.\n\nIt turns out, people don't inherently know even their own chromosomes.\n\nHormonal tests are a problem in the same way. They cause more problems for cisgender athletes, especially cisgender women &amp; women of color who get more scrutiny, than they screen for a tiny amount of transgender athletes.\n\nIt turns out that world class athletes, by definition, don't fit into a typical mean.\n\nLike Michael Phelps is practically an X-Man. He's got a wingspan longer than he is tall, he's double jointed, his body produces much less lactic acid than typical.\n\nIf he was a cisgender woman he'd probably had been barred from competitive swimming altogether, because he wouldn't fit the averages of a woman, even though he doesn't fit the averages of a cisgender man either. It's a situation that hurts everyone.\n\nThe frank truth of the matter is there's no such a thing as perfectly fair sports.",

Once you comprehend this, it all becomes much more clear why this issue is so prevalent.\n\nIt just so happens that the sexual dimorphism of humans makes it that by the time you reach the top levels of competition the open brackets become [male] men only by default, because the athletic performance gap is a canyon.\n\nThere wouldn't be competitive sports for women without restricting it only to the female sex, and even then there is a significant over-representation of top-level figures that present abnormally high androgen levels.  But to counterpoint your claim, there is no other distinguishing characteristic of this species that can so broadly separate everyone at a near 50/50 split with very (comparatively) few outliers.  Without such a separation of any sort half the population would be irrelevant in sports.  It is the most logical point to work with dividing competition; the *most fair* way of being unfair.\n\nBasically no one on either side of the argument cares about trans men playing in \"mens\" leagues and it's scarcely in the news, but both also don't want them to play in \"womens\" leagues, care to guess why?",

It solves the problem of lack of \"fairness\" in sport, while targeting more objective measures of advantage (rather than proxy variables like testosterone levels or \"whether or not someone has a penis\").",

They just need to be over a certain age for the set aside. Physical ability can vary enormously.  \n\nFor women's sports, it should be similar, whether it goes by having a vagina or chromosomes.

If she doesn't, she'll compete at the level of her athletic peers.

The first test was the Barr Body test, after that didn't work so good (notably men with Kleinfelter's would be *eligible to compete as a woman under the standard* as they produced Barr Bodies with their XXY anomaly), they moved on to trying to test the SRY gene because it was at the time viewed as the determinant for sexual differentiation.\n\nSpoiler: Nope. Some cis women (XX, vagina-and-ovaries-havers, whatever you want to call 'em) fail the test because the SRY gene locus is not the sole determinant in sex development. \n\nWhoops. About the only thing you can really say in their defense was that as of '91, this was the new hotness and people were going off the information available to them at that time. It just, uh, didn't quite pass muster when applied to the general populace.\n\nGenetics and sex development is actually incredibly fucking complex. Who *ever* could have seen this coming.\n\nThe IOC finally gave up on the testing in 1999, because they couldn't find a foolproof test and were getting steadily-increasing flak for the party line of claiming that aberrations were too rare to care about.",

Basically Georgia law specifies that anyone who tries to change the vote count to another count that they know to be false is in violation of the law. Even if you argue that Trump thinks he\u2019s doing the right thing, Trump himself admits that he knows the vote count number he\u2019s asking for is false on the call that he makes. He says that he knows he won by \u201chundreds of thousands of votes\u201d and then asks them to change the vote count by \u201cjust 21 thousand or so\u201d (paraphrasing here.)",

The arresting officer politely climbed up next to him in his carriage, and they rode together to the police station for him to pay his fine of a couple dollars.\n\nEdit: went and looked up the story again:\n\n* The arresting officer, William West, was a freed black slave.\n* He was already posted at the intersection because of an earlier incident, and subsequently had already let the president off with a warning the day before the arrest.\n* The president posted a $20 bail and walked back to the White House. He subsequently did not appear in court and forfeited his bond.\n* When the president heard a rumor that the arresting officer was subsequently in danger of losing his job, he sent a messenger to the police chief commending West on his actions and demanding that no harm come to him.",

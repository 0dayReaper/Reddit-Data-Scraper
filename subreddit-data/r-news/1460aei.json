Everyone in Canada knows that people are stealing cars and driving them to a port in quebec run by the mob where they get shipped off.  people with air tags in their stolen car have seem their car taken to this port and they\u2019ve notified the police and they do absolutely nothing about it.",

Cops aren't going to go after someone the courts are just going to let go because it's deemed 'low priority non-violent crime'.\n\nThat's the problem in the US with people just smashing windows and stealing stuff out of cars, even if the cops apprehend someone the courts just let them go with a slap on the wrist.",

Let the prosecutors mess up on their end, but the cops need to make arrests, and help citizens and tourists feel safe. If a stolen car can be tracked and recovered, it needs to be, regardless of what happens to the perpetrators. Then we'll direct our anger at the inept prosecutors.",

They should be upholding peace and order regardless of what happens at the next level beyond them. Your tax dollars pay them to do x regardless of what they think will happen at levels beyond their pay grade. What a weird take..",

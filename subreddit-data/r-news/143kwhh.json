Say you do research for the government and you find something they want/need/like, they will try to find a contractor (usually the lowest bidder) to make it for them at scale, basically giving them the IP with some strings attached, mostly having to do with foreign relations and hiring practices. There is nothing really stopping you from working for one of these contractors either or from selling to private industry at some point later down the line after the contract period has ended just so long as Uncle Sam gets first dibs.",

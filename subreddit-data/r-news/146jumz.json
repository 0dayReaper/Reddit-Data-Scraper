Putin saw an opportunity to drive a wedge into us because plenty of people in America would totally hate a \"wealthy\" black gay sportsball star. His operatives also played up the \"unfairness\" of the trade, like why trade for her instead of a heroic American Marine!!!!. Of course, the reality is that Paul Whelan wasn't available for any trade with us, Putin's saving him for a trade with Germany for an incarcerated Russian spy there.  \n\nBiden had a choice, his choice was take Griner or nothing, and if he didn't, there's a really good chance she would have been killed in a Russian prison within the year, and then Putin's operatives would have played up the \"But Biden let a famous American die in prison in Russia!!!!\" angle instead. \n\nWhat seems to be overlooked especially is how Putin himself orchestrated this whole situation. Anyone other than Griner caught with the same trace amount of THC oil in a vape cartridge would have likely been fined and received a few months of prison time. Putin intervened to order that she be convicted and sentenced to a prison term far longer than normal or customary for the level of offense, and ordered that she be sent to one of the worst prisons in the Russian prison sentence. Why? To put pressure on Biden, that's why. \n\nThis whole charade was orchestrated by Putin to benefit Putin, and part of that was to rile up our anti-LGBTQ conservatives and racists, and it worked. What's so disappointing to me is just how easily our conservatives can be played by Putin. He plays them like a fiddle.\n\nLastly, Viktor Bout was under surveillance for two years before he was busted, and his entire network was either rolled up or rendered irrelevant. Bout mainly traded in arms he stole from the Russian military anyway. He was a couple of years away from reaching his early release date, having served most of his prison sentence, so releasing him a couple of years earlier than he would have walked out on his own is meaningless. Bout is an old man now, an irrelevant man, so the only label that works for him now is the Merchant of Old Age and Irrelevancy. Putin wanted him just for the symbolic value, \"Gay black sportsball druggie for worst mass murderer in all of human history!!!!!\" and nothing more.  I suspect that as soon as Bout loses his propaganda value to Putin he'll fall out of a window somewhere because after all, those arms he stole from Putin would have really been useful to the Russians in Ukraine right about now.",

That's why he intervened and directed the judges to sentence her to ten years, far longer than most if any people get for that violation. Next, she was sent to one of the worst prisons in the Russian system, a prison where she was almost certainly going to get killed, or worse. What's worse? Making her a rape toy for all the male guards in the prison, for one, raped to death. \n\nAnyway, the sentence and prison put a very short expiration date on her life, and that's what he offered Biden. Trade for her, or she dies horribly. Whelan wasn't offered for trade, nor was the teacher, or anyone else. Just her, and only her, because any trade for her would be sure to stir up the anti-LGBTQ conservatives in this country. To maximize that effect, he had his social media operatives seed that perspective of the trade everywhere he could, and it worked great as you can see in these very comments. The hatred he seeded even inspired someone to attack her at an airport in the USA.",

What she didn't know was that Putin had got wind of the situation and was going to maximize her value as a propaganda wedge by having the court sentence her to an extreme sentence. He needed to make sure that Biden knew she had a fairly short expiration date before being killed in a Russian prison. He also knew that if Biden didn't take the deal and she was killed in prison, his social media operators would play that up as Biden abandoning an American to die in a Russia prison. It was lose-lose for Biden because Putin had the tactical upper hand, so Biden chose to get her back alive instead of in a body bag. If that happened Bout would have walked out of prison a free man in a couple of years anyway, and Whelan was never up for trade so he'd still be in prison no matter what.",

So the trucks do use hydraulic compaction, but the pressure is set to a certain limit, and for most haulers they won't even hit that limit.  If you are getting a lot of pressure on your load, every time you cycle your truck(which happens after about 5 to 7 96-gallon carts are dumped), the trash that is under pressure will roll out about.  So there is a certain sweet spot you want to hit, where you aren't fighting against the load you already have on to add more stuff to it.\n\nIn this video, I think this dude is overpacking his truck - https://youtu.be/EaNSzDvZsIk?t=25  Notice how when he cycles the truck again(making the blade go down and pull trash into the body) all of that trash falls out?  That will keep happening until he dumps, and he might have to cycle two or three times at every stop.   So while you won't get crushed into a cube, you would probably have a few broken ribs, and a lot of slash or puncture wounds.  You could never get me to even risk it, I have seen fingers lost, arms taken off, and etc.  I don't go on the back of a truck anymore or drive one, but you would also never see me stand behind the truck while that blade is cycling.  I have had so many bags of unknown waste explode on me.    \n\nAlso, please be nice to your trash man, the job fucking sucks, and most places do not pay very well.",

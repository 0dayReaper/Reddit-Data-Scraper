One of the very very very few Republicans who is likeable and not actively trying to drag the country down",

His disdain for Fascism and oppression  is as organic as can be and it led him to come to America, where he seized opportunity and became one of the most successful men in the  world. I think Arnold probably truly believes in America in a way the current Republican party seems to actively reject.",

Mad props.\n\nEdit 2: if you\u2019re looking for any more music, by any chance, I\u2019ve recently gotten back into writing it after a several year hiatus and would love to do it again. I\u2019ve gotten way better since 2011.\n\nEdit 3: getting a Reddit award from Mr. Schwarzenegger is something I never thought I\u2019d see.",

In particular he:\n\n1. Introduced himself into the conversation as a third party, explaining why he wants to speak (ask to be included in conversation)\n2. Started by not talking about himself or what it is he wanted. Instead he worked to explain his connection to Russia and his deep respect for their people and how his life was changed by a Russian, which he called a hero (identify shared connections and history)\n3. Included his past defense of Russia even during the cold war, thus explaining this is not the first time he has involved himself in politics concerning Russia (ask to be included in conversation)\n4. Continues to explain his shared history and connection and asks for them to listen to what he has to say. (ask to be included again)\n5. Next he pivots to acknowledging their feelings (\"I know no one likes hearing critical things\") and expresses his feelings (I feel this is a critical moment, wrong, and must be talked about)\n6. Now he finally starts with what it is he wants to say, and sticks to the facts (state your position clearly with facts, not emotional appeal)\n7. Pivot back to his feelings, his historical connection, his father's suffering and feelings, and his understanding of how they must feel as well as concern for their feelings (state how you feel, state your understanding of their feelings and position)\n8. Now he is finally ready to get to his message and request (last stage of NVC) but continues to express understanding of their position, their fears, their expected anger as sanctions start taking more and more impact, and how that also makes him feel (don't focus on the outcome, focus on the issue and person/people)\n9. Closes with a message of unity and hope, not demands or threats (Ask for the conversation to continue, don't close doors, don't make threats or demands)\n\nOverall, it was very impressive communication and speaking. I don't know how much of it was him versus his writers but everyone in public speaking or conflict resolution could learn from this message yesterday. I'm very proud of him for speaking up and being an American, as well as his service as Governor.\n\nedit - typo in point five",

I've been overweight all my life, but I started working out about 6 months ago (when I weighed 337 lbs) to get healthier, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has been one of my main role models in this whole experience. \n\nI think part of what makes him so inspiring to me is that he really has put in the work to be as healthy as he is. Most other action movie starts his age aren't nearly as fit as they were back in the day, but Arnold is still incredibly fit and continues to work out while also advocating for programs designed to help people like myself get healthier. He's truly an amazing role model both for bodybuilders and people like me who want to lose a lot of weight.",

Most of them had severe psychological scars.  My FIL was speaking as though he were back in the camp, reliving the horrors yet again, during the last few hours he could speak.  \n\nI really hope Arnie\u2019s message steels the resolve of Russians who are open to hear it and instills courage to respond with action.",

If they were fighting an oppressive nazi regime that didn't have the people's support, the Klitschko brothers would not have done that.

He just had things that needed said and takes the fact he has such a uniquely broad reach as a moral obligation. https://youtu.be/vAWvl-g_6rg",

China is not \"the biggest\" media market, but they are the second biggest, and the fastest growing, and the biggest movie box office market. \n\nWhich to be clear, is not even saying studios are worried about not appealing to Chinese people.  It saying the Chinese government has made it clear to the film industry that \"our market is 34% of the worlds box office revenue, and if you don't do as we say we'll blacklist you from any of it.\"\n\nFor someone like Cena, you figure that's like one part the studio saying \"hey apologize because they told us to make you apologize\". Then that's also one part his agent saying \"dude if you're banned from China, any movie you're in is banned from China, so nobody is going to cast you. You legit can't work.\"\n\nThe whole thing is shitty, but I definitely get the barrel he was stuck over.  The China thing and the Harvey Weinstein thing kinda have this in common. The idea of someone/something with enough power to pull the \"you'll never work again\" card, and it be a legit threat.",

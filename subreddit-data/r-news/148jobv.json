Also zelle operates through ach, it is not outside the system.  The bank just credits you sooner.",

Then my brother told us everyone in his neighborhood was putting key locks on their mailboxes as it had become common for mail to go missing, including his on several occasions. Then his daughter told us her debit card had been skimmed at two different gas stations. And then I got to tell my story of my wife's car having her catalytic converter stolen, and it was parked within sight of the police station.\n\nI don't know if you're the outlier or not, but it certainly seems to me (anecdotally anyway) that petty financial and property crimes are much more common now than in the past, and that there is little to nothing the police can or will do about it. None of the crimes I mentioned were \"solved\" and in my case I got a replacement check from the feds and nothing but a police report on the stolen cat, so I guess that was that I guess.",

Took the check from her hand and rode my motorcycle over and handed it to him. This was end of day and that check was taken to be immediately deposited into an account at wells Fargo. Two weeks later my business account is overdrawn by 9k and my wife calls me in a panic. Go directly to my bank to sort shit out. 3 total checks written, the thing is they aren't my checks. Someone ordered different checks with my name account number  and address, but no phone number and they look nothing like mine either. The signatures were all identical to this one particular check for my supplier \"wife has arthritis and her signature always has a wierd break somewhere\" then police became involved. I explained everything just like this to the detective. He insisted that it must have been taken out of the mail? \"Somehow\". So they got me for 12k got another contractor for 35k.... from checks handed directly to a person who took them directly to a bank. My supplier was investigated thoroughly and I trust him. I'm way out west and the fraudulent checks we cashed in Florida at a wells Fargo and they flat out refused my request to investigate the bank and employees there. My suspicion is that there is someone working at that bank branch who is working with someone else or as a group doing this shit. The police did absolutely nothing, although working with my bank I was able to recover my funds after 2 weeks of the police investigating enough to \"rule me out\". If you work at a bank chip in here please and thank you",

We push money around using national interbank debit systems instead of using cheques which take weeks to get there by mail and clear.\n\n  \nEvery major payee in the country is registered in the banking system. In general you pay bills by searching the list in your bank app, selecting the payee, then typing in your customer number (with the insurance company, utility or tax collector) to register a relationship and then set up your payments.   \n\n\nOr you can give them your banking number and authorization so they can pull from your bank every month, if you're the type who doesn't like to look at the bills and has plenty of money.  \n\n\nI'll add that the credit card companies only exist because of how antiquated the American Banking system was/is.

Americans wrote roughly 3.4 billion checks in 2022, down from nearly 19 billion checks in 1990, according to the Federal Reserve. However, the average size of the checks Americans wrote rose from $673 in 1990 \u2014 or $1,602 in today's dollars \u2014 to $2,652 last year.\"\n\nYou seem super confused about this, so I thought I would help. \n\nCheck usage is down but the average dollar amount per check has gone up. \n\nCombined with the fact that most checks come from the government, businesses or old people, checks are now excellent targets for fraud. So check fraud has gone up. \n\nIf you think that Americans are out here paying for everyday things with checks as a common occurrence, I would encourage you to travel more.",

Dont have to think of it at all, just check in on it from time to time to make sure no compaines are doing dodgy charges. \n\nIf we need to transfer money to anyone for whatever reason, a few clicks on the phone app or internet and its in their account.",

At most companies use them among themselves. \n\nAnd I certainly don\u2019t mean Paypal or other services like those that charge you to hell and back or fuck you over without repercussions. I deleted my account years ago when they started charging fees for transferring money to friends, kept increasing fees for exchanging currencies etc. It was and has been a lot cheaper to let the bank do the currency exchange.",

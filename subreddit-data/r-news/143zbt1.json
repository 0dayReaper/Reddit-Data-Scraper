(Notice most of those attacks on ex employees he stokes are on anyone from the company who advocates for diverse voices or protection against misinformation &amp; hate speech.)\n\nWorkers banding together against him and wielding power he can't control is his worst nightmare.\n\nThat's why he's turned twitter into an amplification platform for far-right hate.  Bigotry benefits him personally because it keeps workers divided rather than united.  It's active disempowerment of the working class by a billionaire bigot.",

He got into bed with Apartheid regime and began smuggling emeralds afterwards. \nSounds like a serious and credible source. Don't you every wonder why these internet rumors can never be sourced to anything but *other* internet rumors?\n\nThere was no internet during the 1980's when Errol Musk was flying emeralds back and forth from Zambia to South Africa with the full knowledge of the Apartheid Secret Police. Or do you believe that the South African government would give such a lucrative scheme to someone which had an Anti-Apartheid stance? About as realistic as Putin giving business deals to someone who is Anti-Putin.\n\n\"Where is the actual news coverage? The actual documentation?\"\n\nWhy would the South African intelligence services keep documentation especially when Zambia was involved? They destroyed documentation with reagrds to state security,Apartheid informants etc. before the hand over of power to the new government\n\n\"Elon Musk is a major public figure. If there is so much jaw-dropping scandal in his past, why can't CNN, the *New York Times*, etc. seem to find it?\"\n\nBecause he is part of the super wealthy elite,runs Tesla and have contracts with US government with SpaceX. Watch business programs such as CNBC and see for yourself how the news anchors fawn over blue chip CEO's and Wall Street heavy hitters.\n\n\"But now you're admitting that he *did* grow up in an anti-Apartheid household\"\n\nAnd didn't do anything with that upbringing to highlight the injustice of Apartheid. \n\n&gt; Elon growing up in an \"Anti-Apartheid \" household to a dad that was a liberal politician meant that he was more than aware of the evils of the Apartheid system.\n\n\"And your main complaint against him is that he didn't become an activist?\"\n\nThought Elon grew up in this \"Anti-Apartheid Progressive family \" which resulted in him fleeing to Canada because he didn't want be conscripted into the Apartheid army. Thousands upon thousands of South African teens were activists but somehow Elon chose to remain silent despite his \"progressive' upbringing. \n\n&gt; But Elon was somehow special and couldn't join up with the numerous Anti-Apartheid activists groups in Canada or the US from the safety of those countries?\n\n\"Okay. You are free to find fault wherever you please. But this won't strike most people as a very damning indictment of his character.\"\n\nIt will. He was certainly old enough to know right from wrong.",

According to him, they went to the mine in the Lake Tanganyika region \u201cto pick up a cargo of emeralds and fly them back to their native South Africa\u201d.**\n\n\n&gt;As per his statement: \u201cI visited the mine once, Elon came with me. It was lousy. There was nothing to eat except stamp mielies [ground dried corn]. Elon never ate anything for four days in a row.\u201d\n\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/24/plugged-in\n\n\n\n&gt;When he was eleven\u2014about the time that he sold his first piece of software, a video game called Blastar\u2014**Musk told his mother that he was going to move back to Pretoria to live with his father, Errol, an electrical engineer who would later own an auto-parts store and a share in an emerald mine.** \u201cYou have three kids and Dad has no kids,\u201d Musk explained. (\u201cMy father is not a fun guy to be around, but it seemed like the right thing to do,\u201d he told me.) He hoped that his father would move with him to America, where he\u2019d once taken him on a visit. America was comics, movies, technology\u2014freedom. When that plan failed, Musk immigrated to Canada on his own, at seventeen.\n\n\nHere's the quote from another source from Errol Musk\n\n\nA teenage Elon Musk once casually sold his father's emeralds to Tiffany &amp; Co. while his dad was sleeping\n\n\nhttps://www.news24.com/news24/bi-archive/elon-musk-sells-the-family-emeralds-in-new-york-2018-2\n\n\n&gt;**Elon, by his father\u2019s recollection then probably 16 years old, and his brother Kimbal, decided to sell emeralds to Tiffany &amp; Co. on Fifth Avenue in New York \u2013 one of the world's most famous jewellers \u2013 as his father lay sleeping.** \"They just walked into Tiffany\u2019s and said, \u2018Do you want to buy some emeralds?\u2019\" Errol recalled in an interview with Business Insider South Africa. \"And they sold two emeralds, one was for $800 and I think the other one was for $1,200.\"\n\n\nA few days later the family returned to the store to find that Tiffany was selling the $800 emerald, now set in a ring, for $24,000 -- a markup of 30 times the price Elon had received for the gem.\n\n\n&gt;Errol has used the story as on object lesson in how retail works ever since. He was surprised but not concerned by the incident, Errol says, because money was plentiful.\n\n\n&gt;\u201cWe were very wealthy,\u201d says Errol. \u201cWe had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe.\u201d\n\n\n&gt;With one person holding the money in place, another other would slam the door.\n\n\n&gt;\u201cAnd then there'd still be all these notes sticking out and we'd sort of pull them out and put them in our pockets.\u201d\n\n\nAnd just to top it off - a source from Elon himself in an interview from Forbes. They no longer host the interview on their site \n\n\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140901222916/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2014\n\n\n&gt;But I\u2019ve been in physical danger before. The funny thing is I\u2019ve not actually been that nervous. In South Africa, my father had a private plane we\u2019d fly in incredibly dangerous weather and barely make it back. **This is going to sound slightly crazy, but my father also had a share in an Emerald mine in Zambia. I was 15 and really wanted to go with him but didn\u2019t realize how dangerous it was.** I couldn\u2019t find my passport so I ended up grabbing my brother\u2019s \u2013 which turned out to be six months overdue! So we had this planeload of contraband and an overdue passport from another person. There were AK-47s all over the place and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cMan, this could really go bad.\u201d\n\n\n/07/28/elon-musk-tells-me-his-secret-of-success-hint-it-aint-about-the-money",

Lawyers flocked to Freemont employees to try for a repeat. This follow-up case was inevitable purely on financial risk/reward grounds for the lawyers.\n\nThe only possible way for the case to go forward is with people employed during the timeframe of the original case; after that time period, Tesla has too much CYA for anything to fly.",

A Tesla investor is also suing him in Texas for fostering a Toxic work culture. If you don't automatically leap to the conclusion that its impossible for Tesla to foster a toxic work culture. You'd recognize the reality that 4 different entities claiming the same fact, may be based in reality. \n\nAlso, the US is litigious against corporations because infamously, that is the only punishment they are subject to. It is near impossible to hold a multi billion dollar corporation criminally liable. We saw that in the obvious case of Wells Fargo who defrauded customers of all colors and only paid a fine. \n\n\n[California Civil Rights Department Takes Tesla to Court Over Failure to Comply with Investigative Subpoena Regarding Allegations of Discrimination](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/crdnews/apr132023pr/#:~:text=Sacramento%20%2D%20The%20California%20Civil%20Rights,of%20unlawful%20harassment%20and%20discrimination.)\n\n[Black former worker awarded $3.2m in Tesla factory racial-harassment suit](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/03/tesla-racial-harassment-lawsuit-award-california-factory)\n\n[Tesla hit by new lawsuit alleging racial abuse against Black workers](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-hit-by-new-lawsuit-alleging-racial-abuse-against-black-workers-2022-07-01/)\n\n[Elon Musk hit with Tesla investor lawsuit over 'toxic' work culture](https://financialpost.com/fp-work/elon-musk-tesla-investor-lawsuit-toxic-work-culture)",

Good people don't groom their own toddler aged step daughter, and Elon certainly didn't fall far from the tree.\n\nIn fact Elon's path in life isn't that different from other sociopath self made billionaires, think Gates, Bezos, Jobs, Bankman-Fried, Elizabeth Holmes etc. Children born not into extreme wealth, but rather solidly upper middle class wealth, who can afford to take risks with bank of Mom and Dad to fall back on, and then because they lack all human empathy, are able to ruthlessly ride their white privilege into making it big, and once big, start squeezing every drop of blood from their employees to make it even bigger, because, again, they are sociopaths.",

I've left Alexandria before at 9 PM and it's taken longer because of that godforsaken overpass. I remain convinced that Christ was actually crucified there and is the reason 95 is constantly cursed on that stretch",

But I'd say for the next 2-3 weeks traffics going to suck in the Philly on local highways and cross streets.   \n   \nEdit: oh god, just saw the damage on an up close photo.

Up until that point, it was absolutely confusing, since you had one I-95 just randomly become I-295 southeast of Trenton and another I-95 randomly start outside of Bordentown. Now you have I-95 turn onto I-276 until it crosses the Delaware River and merged with the NJ Turnpike, where it continues north as I-95.",

The turn around time for this was incredible and very similar. 1 section of the bridge collapsed, multiple sections on both sides compromised and had to be replaced.\n\nFingers crossed this one may be a little better since the i85 was the only major road coming into the city from the north east side and all traffic headed into/out of the city from the north now had to travel to the i75 entrance or use side roads. Iirc the beltway (i285) from the i85 to i75 also had construction on it during this time so that became a nightmare. Look like philly may have better options on the i95\n\nThis is just me speculating so take it with a grain of salt.",

Typical form runs can produce one or two beams at a time, depending how long the form is, so best case scenario is that it will be at least a month if not more for the first of the replacement beams to arrive on site. Beams are typically cast in a 24 hour cycle if they\u2019re using a steam to accelerate the initial cure rate of the concrete. It\u2019s unknown if the casting yard that supplied these beams is set up for steam, or a 24 hour casting cycle. They may not have the employees or the space to do that.~~\n\nA closer look at the bridge indicates the beams are steel, not prestressed concrete:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@40.0238244,-75.0310804,3a,75y,35.27h,84.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRDcFTXvLRsOn9UfZVczczA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!5m1!1e1?entry=ttu\n\nThe good news is that steel beams can be built much faster than prestressed beams can be delivered, so though the loss of this bridge is dire, it's not quite as dire as it could have been.\n\nEdited to correct google maps link.",

                            "comment": "The steam is used to accelerate the initial setting of the concrete so that the beam can be stripped from the forms the next day. They block the beams up in another part of the yard for a few weeks to get the strength high enough to be transported and installed. Typically it takes concrete around 28 days to reach most of its cure strength. In a tightly-run yard the next day's rebar cages and such are completed next to the form while today's concrete is poured, screeded, and steamed. The steaming goes on overnight. The next morning the forms are pulled back, the strand is cut at the end jacking plates, the beam is lifted out and set aside, the form is cleaned and oiled, rebar assembly is placed, strand is pulled through it and stressed, then the forms are moved back in and concrete is placed in the form. There are other things too, like if the strand is depressed or draped, post-tensioning ducts, etc, but that's the gist of it.",

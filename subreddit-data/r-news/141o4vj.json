Kessler, the author, suggested that the brother in law, according to FBI standards, should have followed up to someone else within the bureau instead of telling one supervisor then washing his hands of it. \n\nThe book also mentioned that Hanssen installed a closed circuit camera in his bedroom so his friends could watch a live stream of him having sex with his wife. \n\nHe was a peculiar man to say the least.",

Chris Cooper was great, but he comes across as a lot more menacing than Hansen, who was more creepy, IMO.  Whichever way, there's a lot more detail in this, if not as intense as Breach just by virtue of being a TV miniseries.",

Obviously if you're constantly having to take money, have been caught stealing etc. They're red flags. A regular overdraft doesn't discard someone from this, not personal loans, over drafts etc.\n\nUnexplained income e.g. a nice car and house but little historical wages would equally be a red flag - unless accounted for e.g. a spouse, family etc.\n\nEven things like speeding fines wouldn't discard a person. A person who went backpacking* last year is more likely to be rejected - no matter how innocent that act is.\n\nVisits to known countries e.g. Russia would also be red flags.\n\nThey obviously won't publish reasons or the strict criteria but that's the general principle. They will have access to working history, travel, banks etc. It's ultra invasive and can even lead to them going through rubbish bins and extreme monitoring - it all depends on the level of clearance and access required.\n\nThen you'll get the odd idiot e.g. the discord leaker, who passes these checks but are dumb enough to be dangerous - if unintentional.\n\n\nEdit* by backpacking I mean extended (4+ weeks) stays outside the country, particularly where your whereabouts can't be fully accounted for",

The assumption was always that people who were *ideologically aligned* with the Soviet Union would be most likely to spy for them (communists, socialists, gays, liberals); but the people that the KGB had the most luck recruiting were white, male, religious, and suffering from a narcissistic grievance over not being recognized for their own imagined greatness or value.",

The truth is that most spying is for a okay sum of money and the work is done by faceless people observing or talking to people; maybe with the occasional swiping of classified documents that were accidentally left on a table.",

Hanssen then began to videotape his sexual encounters secretly and shared the videotapes with Hoschouer. Later, he hid a video camera in the bedroom connected via a closed-circuit television line so that Hoschouer could observe the Hanssens from his guest bedroom.  He also explicitly described the sexual details of his marriage on Internet chat rooms, giving information sufficient for those who knew them to recognize the couple.\n\nHanssen frequently visited D.C. strip clubs and spent a great deal of time with a Washington stripper named Priscilla Sue Galey. She went with Hanssen on visits to Hong Kong and the FBI training facility in Quantico, Virginia.[69] Hanssen gave her money, jewels, and a used Mercedes-Benz but ended contact with her before his arrest when she began abusing drugs and doing sex work. Galey claims that although she offered to have sex with him, Hanssen declined, saying he was trying to convert her to Catholicism.\u201d",

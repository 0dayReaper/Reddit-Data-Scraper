First of all, how do you not understand why that's the case. Second of all, why do you think a 17 year old making $7.50/hr is setting the prices for cat toys for this multi-billion dollar corporation?\n\nI think that these people lack critical and abstract thinking abilities. They can't *see* something, so they can't understand it. They are told something is \"systemic\" and it's too hard for them to understand. They can't understand that centuries of culture plays a huge role. They think only what they've *seen* in their lifetimes is what exists. They think that because the CRA was passed in 1964 that it ended racism because it was written down that it was over and done with. \n\nThey need to see 1 person being blamed and then being told the issue is resolved or their little brains explode. Abstract, decades-long, systemic, global, etc. are all substantially too wide a scope for them to handle.",

Other old denominations like Russian/Greek/Syrian Orthodox all do too. \n\nIt\u2019s the Evangelicals, Baptists, and non-denominational Christian groups that seem to be the problem. \n\nI wonder if it\u2019s because the older churches have devoted centuries to studying and refining the religion, building institutions, etc. Meanwhile the newer, less organized denominations seem to revolve around personalities rather then institutions. Like Billy Graham, Joel Olsteen, etc. \n\nTo be a Catholic Priest, you have to go to school and develop a good understanding of Christianity. To be a Non-Denominational *Pastor*, you really just have to be persuasive and engaging enough to build a following. \n\nI think Mormonism is one of the exceptions. It\u2019s much younger than most denominations, but it put a major focus on building institutions. The religion itself is ridiculous imo, but every Mormon family I know strongly values education, whether it\u2019s religion or the sciences.",

Went to a Catholic highschool, received a good education. I specifically remember my freshman year in Bio when we started discussing evolution, and someone said \"well wait I thought God created the universe and everything\". Our teacher just shrugged and said \"if you want to say that God had a hand in stirring the primordial soup that let singular celled organisms develop, and then guided the evolutionary trail, sure, go for it. Nevertheless, there's demonstrable evidence of &lt;insert all the scientifically based topics we covered&gt;\". Great woman, was there I believe 30 odd years, I hope she's enjoying retirement. You were a great teacher in many ways Ms. Link.\n\nAlso had a nun for my Chem classes and she pushed us hard. I remember her trying over and over again to get people to grasp the fundamentals. \"Focus the concepts\" she always said. It was one of those things that as a teen you dont appreciate because youre full of yourself, but reflecting back I see what she meant, and I thank her for her work as well, may she rest in peace.",

Let that sink in. Just as long as money is not spent on abortions or primates, you can spend it on whatever you want.",

We are the richest nation on the planet, our schools should be cutting edge! It\u2019s 2020, we have the resources, we just refuse to allocate them appropriately.\n\nUltimately it\u2019s an investment in our nation and future, and pays off immensely when those children grow up and found billion dollar US companies, create jobs, cure diseases, discover new things, and invent new technologies.",

Most school systems are funded by their respective state government with only supplemental funding from the feds. So there's more layers of government that less people pay attention to making the funding decisions for them, making it easier to get away with underfunding them.\n\nThere's also just the tax base issue. I doubt base schools are funded by property taxes. Schools in poor areas get hit especially hard because not only are the students already poor, but the property around the school isn't worth much (hence poor people being able to afford to live there), and their funding comes almost entirely out of taxes based on those property values.",

I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902\u20131912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oilwent on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.\"\n\nSmedley Darlington Butler",

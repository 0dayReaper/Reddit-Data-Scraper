The oldest of the siblins is a 13 years old girl, followed by a 9yo, so I guess they already knew what they had to eat in there, just that they were lost. Any other person not familiar with that place would struggle even walking there.  \nOther thing about this, a dog called Wilson went missing this morning, and the rescue team is STILL looking for him, they found the children when following the dog's track, and according to Colombia's media the children saw the dog at some point. Colombian people are calling authorities to continue the search for Wilson now.",

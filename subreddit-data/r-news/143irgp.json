It last erupted from September 2021-December 202~~3~~2, took a brief pause, then continued from January 2023-March 2023.\n\nIt's more newsworthy when it *stops* erupting.",

My favorite stretch was the western side from Waimea south-south-east to where it connects with the highway. Curvy and pastoral--almost like being somewhere in the north Atlantic, but... not. The contrast between that and the almost Martian landscape nearer to the AF base and observatory is just a wild experience to drive.",

Probably because that's where most of my aunties, uncles, and cousins are. It also has the most to do though. Hiking, museums, shops, swimming and snorkeling, restaurants, big city, farming country (although this is shrinking), desert, pine forests, rainforests, temples and palaces. Although Oahu doesn't have the MOST beaches, hikes, and so on, it does have the some of the BEST my opinion. \n\nIt is getting more and more crowded, and prices are always going to be higher than anything on the mainland. If you're there for a long time you can find the local farmer's markets to buy produce and fish, swap meet for cheap clothes and house hold items, and there are a couple Costco's for pantry items or anything else. Plus Oahu has the best hospitals in the islands. \n\nThe Big Island, as an adult, is a close second. When I was a kid I hated it. My Uncle had 3 produce boxes of digest sized comic books that he was happy to share with me, so that was pretty awesome! Other than that, it was the island we went to to help family. Work on the farm, remodel or maintain houses, build sheds and stuff, and basically spend the whole summer working. My friends were so jealous when I'd go to Hawaii for 3-4 weeks until I explained that I went to the beach 3 times. Twice when the sun was already setting and the water gets cold fast once the sun goes down, and once when it was raining. Now that's like my dream summer vacation!\n\nI can't say anything great about the Hawaiian public schools though. They really are bad.",

I went once, with a girlfriend, and it was perfect for that trip because we took advantage of the nightlife, that none of the other islands have, and it was kind of a decadent, new girlfriend type trip. But for my normal sensibilities and preferences, Maui and Kauai are better. \n\nNone of the islands are bad places to be, so it's kind of a \"which ice cream flavor is best\" kind of argument: very subjective between some nice experiences.",

Most of the other islands have smaller towns spread out over wider areas. The Big Island is very spread out and even in Kailua-Kona and Hilo you never see the kind of congestion you'd get in, say, a suburb in California.\n\nThat said, though, I'm very much on team \"there are a lot more good reasons not to live in Hawaii than reasons to live there\". The job market just doesn't keep up with the cost of living, there's tension between locals and transplants, and even the Big Island is so small you can drive around it in a few hours.\n\nI spent a big chunk of my childhood living on the Big Island, and part of me wants to move back, but the realistic/pragmatic side of me knows that it would be a bad idea. I have to pay the bills now as an adult, and being able to drive now makes the island feel a *lot* smaller. Last year I spent an entire week just driving around exploring California and southern Oregon and it was wonderful. There's thousands of miles of continent here that I can easily explore so long as I avoid places that will be sketchy because I have California license plates.",

Schools are also absolute garbage, I've heard. \n\nIt's definitely not \"paradise\".",

People can go to their nearest reservation and demand a Pow Wow (even if the tribe doesn't do that) and that everything has to revolve around them because \"omg we're spending money here!!\" and that's after most of them have been getting priced out of their homes and at least half the res can't even be walked on because of UXO. Welcome to Hawaii where the memories are fresher about all the colonial nonsense because it happened barely 100 years ago. And I haven't even touched the barrel of worms that was the annexation and the over throw, and military bases just planted everywhere just to remind you what would happen if those native Hawaiians got a little uppity and really starting resisting, the statehood vote, being the complete afterthought for governmental things, *the fucking Jones Act,* having to act all happy and like nothing is wrong when they're having to work 2-3 jobs at minimum and they're one paycheck away from homelessness, and also at the same time having to absorb a lot of people from the Marshalls because the US government decided to nuke the shit out of those islands since people downwind of Los Alamos were getting sick from radiation...\n\n*Gee I wonder why they don't like outsiders in general.*\n\nSource: Haole in Hawaii - I don't have problems because it shockingly takes zero dollars and zero cents to just be respectful and pleasant. And able to take no for an answer. And a history degree. Let me tell you, my Pacific history and Hawaiian history classes were two of the most depressing classes I have ever been in and when dealing with history, you're mired in a lot of depressing classes.",

Kind of the whole thing about being an island in the middle of the ocean near the equator is there isn\u2019t much to vary the temperature and the ocean moderates it heavily. It\u2019s showing &lt;80 all over the island right now. \n\nAlso cramped congested and overcrowded? I\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t on the big island then. Yes, some of the smaller islands are tourist traps.",

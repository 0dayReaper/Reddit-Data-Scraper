It's been several years of re-seeding this paranoia on the conservative base, and it's working as planned.  I recently went on vacation to Mexico and overheard two American women with their kids enjoying the nice weather and beach and casually chatting about Democrats having underground tunnels and dungeons to convert all toddlers into transgender rainbow militants and that something \"has to be done.\"  They are not joking.",

It culminated with parents showing up to the school with shovels to dig for the secret sex tunnel dungeons.  An archaeological firm was even hired to help in the search for secret underground sex dungeons.  The whole thing is absurd and completely unreasonable.

This same pattern repeats in every conservative moral panic. It's happened for every racial minority, every rights movement, and now it's been going through the sexual and gender orientation groups. Happened to gay people before, and now they're getting a little caught the middle. Currently, it's trans people. Nobody cared about them for decades. Then they started getting some recognition and conservatives made jokes and mocked it with stuff like \"identifying as attack helicopters\". We're now at the \"attack you and want to burn you\" stage, and we got here specifically because the ignoring and ridiculing didn't make them go away, and didn't make people hate them more, they've just become more accepted. This is the lashing out part because they've failed. Its the hard part, the most violent part, and the most dangerous part, but the end result is conservative bigots continuing their streak of losing as they've eventually done for all of history.",

If someone puts up a yard sale sign on a public light pole there is no law (that I know of) that says another person can't clean the pole up and remove the sign.

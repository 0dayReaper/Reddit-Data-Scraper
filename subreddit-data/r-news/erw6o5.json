Only one city council member voted against the plan, and that is because he wanted to switch to the Flint River instead.  The switch to KWA was to be a multi-year effort.\n\nDetroit water immediately announced they were terminating the contract with Flint, effective in 1 year (the minimum notice required by the contract), and would be sharply raising rates after the 1-year period.  This is when Flint, under direction of the emergency manager, decided to use Flint water as a stop-gap solution until KWA was ready.\n\nDetroit offered to allow Flint back on Detroit water with a multi-year contact, but there was no limit on the cost that Detroit could charge after the first year.  Flint had lost trust in Detroit water after the previous contract cancellation and attempted rate hike.  Therefore, they continued with the plan to use Flint River as an interim solution.",

Flint was well on it's way to a new water supply when Detroit did that. Like a vindictive spouse - they set the ball rolling. Now if the water treatment folks in Flint took one class in water treatment they would have immediately softened/hardened the water to not change the PH flowing thru all those pipes. Blows my mind I mean don't they normally test and adjust water reservoirs for PH/hardness etc.? Things like rainfall or changes in supply I thought were constantly monitored. I mean they had one job to do and they didn't.",

Earley then decides to save a little extra $$ by sourcing their drinking water from a new place. Groups say hey this water isn't safe and Earley decides screw it I dont have a degree but they're not actually serious issues and the $$ I'll save will be worth it. Then Doctors months later say hey we are seeing high levels of lead in children and it's due to the water they are drinking and again Earley says ehhhh fuck it $$ saved is better. \n\nDoes the state not have any people overseeing these permits and reviewing the data?!?! \n\nI work for a water testing company that reports to the state and the amount of review before approving things is crazy does the whole state of Michigan just give 0 fucks?",

Detroit water was $7b in debt.  The exorbitant water prices are necessary to cover the debt.  Very little goes towards the actual processing and delivering of water. \n\nThis corruption in the Detroit water system is what made flint decide to switch water systems.   Detroit water never got the blame they deserve for the crisis.   Flint decided to build a new pipeline to Lake Huron, a pipeline that threatened Detroit waters monopoly.  When flint made the announcement, Detroit water essentially cut flint off as if to say \u201cgood luck finding water for your city during the 18 months it\u2019ll take to build the new pipeline!\u201d\n\nFlint was forced into using the river.  Even this decision to use river water wasn\u2019t terrible.  This was the original source of flint drinking water, there was still infrastructure in place, including dams and reservoirs.  The \u201cmistake\u201d was in not having knowledgeable people run the water plant.   Through sheer ignorance some very important and rather inexpensive chemicals did not get added to the water.  A mistake that should have been caught by the locals, the state, and the feds.   Everyone signed off and nobody caught this glaring mistake.  \n\nWhere it turned criminal, in my opinion, is when the state and city knew the water was contaminated but continued putting out press releases stating the water was perfectly safe when tests showed otherwise.  \n\nOne of the most maddening things is that in the end, flint built the pipeline for tens of millions of dollars but is now locked into a contract with Detroit water and are unable to utilize the new pipeline.",

Granted, it protects you from a major hit to the bottom line. But if your company is generally safe, all that money that you could be putting into premiums is put into one large pool and at the end of the year whatever is left is surplus and can be spent elsewhere",

This turns into a tangled web because it is a tangled web.\n\nBut the TL:DR is the equipment to add orthophosphate wasn't installed.  The EPA has different rules on how systems when first started are supposed to figure out how much orthophosphate to add.  The MDEQ thought they could run the system while testing while the equipment was being installed(turns out this only applies to small municipalities).\n\nFlint knew it couldn't afford the rates Detroit water and sewer was charging.  They along with neighboring communities started their own water authority(KWA) with the plan to build a pipeline from lake Huron which would feed into the Flint water treatment plant.  The Flint water treatment plant did not have the needed equipment to treat the water with orthophosphate.   It was planned to update the plant but Flint was broke.  Beginning in 2012 emergency managers take over.  In 2013 the EM and city council discuss their water options(either stick with Detroit and dump the KWA or head in the direction of the KWA, or use the Flint river).  The city council votes to join the KWA.  Now this is where confusion starts to set in.  The council at this time had zero power so this decision is essentially meaning less, however, the EM at the time refused to make a decision and felt it was up to the council since it would impact Flint beyond his time.  So this decision, made by the council was the decision the EM followed.  In 2013 the EM signs to join the KWA even though it is not ready yet to pump water and flint is not ready to treat it(2-3 years away).  This means they need to rely on Detroit until it is ready.  Detroit water says fuck you, the Flint contract with them is ending in 1 year.  They jack up the rates on the new contract sky high.  Flint has an engineering firm look at getting water from the Flint river as a stop gap.  In early 2014 the new EM tells Detroit water to fuck off, the decision is made to use the Flint river as a stop gap.   Flint makes an upgrade to the plant which was finished in 2014 but this upgrade DID NOT include the equipment to add the orthophosphate, there just wasn't any money at the time.  During all of this a fateful decision is made.  The EPA has two different rules for treating water that is based solely on the population of the city.  With one rule you treat the water immediately and make adjustments over time,  with the other rule you run the system without treatment and make adjustments over time.  Flint with the MDEQ signing off followed the second rule.  They thought they could run the system while testing and at the same time get the equipment installed in the Flint water treatment plant.  By the time the testing phase was done the equipment would be ready.  The equipment was finished being installed in November 2015 at a cost of millions of dollars.  This is the same time that the Michigan state government finally admitted there was a problem with lead leaching.  This doesn't even go into the complete clusterfuck that was the initial water testing either which also caused a large amount of confusion and is part of the reason why the government was so slow to respond.",

The area is still fucked. They cleaned up the big fuck up, but nuclear waste is still an issue.\n\n Whenever they work on roads in the Falls, they've found literal toxic sludge under the asphalt and have to halt construction. Hot spots all over the county on random roads and properties. They seemed to have literally used the sludge as fill for some road areas with how often they find it.\n\nThe largest toxic waste dump in the north east was a mile behind my school. The whole district, k-12, a row of buildings on a nice manicured lawn with woods behind it, and immediately behind the tree line was dump property with the holding ponds. Definitely in the ground water. Records I looked up on ground water contaminants confirmed my suspicions, but its been ignored and never addressed.\n\nI have an incurable neurological condition. I had 2 neighbors, one girl across the street has a life long condition, and one girl that lived next to me has several chronic conditions, I can't remember what they have exactly. But all of us developed separate rare conditions around the same time, we're all about the same age, all girls. I can't prove it, but there's no way it's *not* linked to the environment, specifically the ground water. And cancer rates are higher there.\n\nThe lifelong devastation from health problems caused by environmental factors, directly created by corruption, (Niagara Falls was corrupt af for decades), isn't something I'd wish on my worst enemy. \n\nBut the problems in WNY aren't proven or well known. So people can still move in and out of homes easily.\n\nI can't fucking imagine being trapped somewhere *knowing* the water is making you sick.",

Arguably worse, as you mentioned there were less regulations.\n\nLots of stuff goes to the toxic waste dump. But there are radioactive hot spots all over the county. Parts of the Manhattan project went to the dump.\n\nLots of nasty stuff that wreaks havoc on people, especially prolonged exposure. Hooker chemical used to have outlet pipes to the Niagara river (north of the falls where it lets out into lake Ontario) and the water was awful. That kind of dumping temporarily made lake Erie officially a dead lake. The zebra muscles actually helped clean the water a lot, after they were forced to stop dumping of course, but the sediment is still filthy. There are always warnings about going to lake beaches after storms. You're limited to eating one fish a month from the lake if I remember correctly, pregnant women have been warned to never eat lake fish.\n\nUsed to get an ear infection if you put your head under the water, according to the guy that taught me almost everything I know about sailing. He was related to the guy that owned hooker chemical, same last name. Grew up during the dumping. Sailing and swimming in that water since the late 50s, when he first started sailing.\n\nSo you're right that it's absolutely not *all* radioactive material. There's a lot of terrible shit. But there's absolutely nuclear waste in the dump. And spots that set off monitors all over, I'll try to find a video someone did with a news article about it. It was years ago, can't remember if it was buffalo news or not.",

The Flint River has always been an emergency source of water for the city, but this time they cheaped out on treating the water with anti-corrosive chemicals and the water began to deteriorate the lead pipes. The cover up by a parade of State officials trying to protect the governor dragged the water issue out much longer than it should have been.",

And that's just the tip of the iceberg of their corruption and doesnt even touch on all the shit they did to effectively insert themselves as a middleman in the resources buying system, or the shady book keeping practices they were inevitably nabbed for, or the shady lobbying related shit. One of the guys literally wrote new laws, removed old regulations for the related industries then quit his govt job to work at Enron to immediately take advantage of the new loopholes he himself opened up!!\n\nLike you said, most people only know that Enron did _something_ and there was lots of late night paper shredding. They don't realize the depths of Enron's depravity.\n\nHere's a couple other things to check out re: Enron\n\nThe documentary \"Smartest Guys In The Room\" it was on Netflix at some point. Not sure if still there.\n\nThe Dollop episode about enron: https://www.podcasts.com/the-dollop-with-dave-anthony/episode/239-enron\n\nEnron is the best cautionary tale for why utilities should never be privatized.",

It boggles my mind that in america, the heads of corporations or governments can literally poison tens of thousands of people and the worst they face is civil lawsuits. It just doesnt make sense to me. If you personally dumped lead into someones water supply, you would go to jail, likely for a long time. But be the head of a massive national water utility and do the same, you face a measly 5-10 million dollar fine and go about your day. How can you believe that these people will ever face justice when they can literally kill americans and then suck it up and throw a couple dollars to walk scot free.",

They knowingly let people drink toxic water for over a year which led to people dying. \n\nThat is on top of gross incompetence which led to the decision to pump water directly from the Flint River, which is not an excuse when it leads to people's deaths. They didn't even add anti-corrosive agents to the water which would have cost $200/day, which would lead me to believe they knew what the risks were and chose not to do to save money.\n\nEveryone involved in that should be in prison. [At least 5 were charged with manslaughter](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/us/flint-water-crisis-manslaughter.html), but more should be put behind bars",

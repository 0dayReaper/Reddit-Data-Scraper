It seems ridiculous that any decent lawyer would tell their client, \"Yeah, just go ahead and admit under oath to raping her.\" Seems like taking the 5th might have been smart here.\n\nI guess this answers my other question, which was 'How do you prove a rape happened decades after the fact?'.

Trust me, I know.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the US, [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/) provides a good starting point for getting help, especially if you\u2019re not sure where to go.\n\nYou can also reach their 24/7 helpline at **800.656.HOPE**.  If you don\u2019t feel like picking up the phone, there\u2019s a live chat you can access through their homepage.\n\n\nGentlemen, I know that the road to help can feel especially isolating, so in addition to RAINN, there\u2019s [1in6](https://1in6.org/). They have specific resources for men. There\u2019s a free 24/7 chat line. Here\u2019s the [link](https://1in6.org/helpline/). They also have online support groups that meet every week.\n\n\nWhoever you are out there, take care of yourself. You deserve to feel whole again.  \n",

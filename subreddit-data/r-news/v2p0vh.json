The silver bullet was the TMZ testimony. \n\nTMZ producer testified they received a video from someone who can get copyright authority in less than 15mins (not possible unless it's the copyright OWNER provided the video, aka instantly waived their right to ownership) and then testified that the video the court received was much longer than the video TMZ shown and testified that they received it unedited (meaning amber edited it). The edited part was amber snickering. \n\nThat was the silver bullet testimony because editing a video to make you look better and sending it to TMZ is unquestionably a example of malice.\n\n\n The op ed wasnt enough to proof malice because she might actually believe that she was abused. \n\nThe edited evidence (the saturated picture with the same timestamp) and edited video submitted to a gossip rag are \"got ya\" examples of malice.",

They were trying to get him to say he didnt see any evidence of tampering and really wanted him to say 'no' the file didnt show signs of tampering but after repeating the question over and over and objecting to every explanation the guy tried to provide, he finally says the opposite of what they were trying for, 'yes' the file has been modified from the original.",

So I was like, well do you tell my work I had to stay or do they know I'm choosing lol?\n\nIt was a very interesting experience if I'm honest. Grand Jury shows you a lot. Everything from lower level theft/drug felonies to child molestation, cops caught doing drug evidence, and a fatal police involved shooting.\n\nBut anyways, moral of the story, two weeks was enough.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that the foreman had already been there 2 weeks when I got there. He just really enjoyed it and worked at Honda who apparently dgaf.\n\nBonus story: We all sat in a room on the first day while they had people give reasons they couldn't serve and figured out alternates. *Most* reasons were religious. This one older man simply said \"I lack the divine authority to judge others.\" That has always stuck with me, just so eloquently put.\n\nAnyways, this one classic rural Ohio guy stands up and says \"I have strong opinions and they just don't change.\" Lol they were like yep get the fuck outta the court, we don't need you.\n\nIt's an odd sense of civic duty, but I'm glad to participate in our justice system (which is absolutely NOT perfect by any means).",

The commentator was saying that the British court found that Heard's accusations of domestic abuse were credible, but **this is false**; the British court ruled that there was sufficient evidence that The Sun reported what they had heard and had made nothing up... therefore they were not committing libel in their reporting.  This case was specifically about an Op-Ed that Heard wrote where she herself claimed to be an abused spouse and made claims about Depp without naming him, but she had no evidence to back up that claim and the jury determined that there was sufficient evidence that she acted with *actual malice* to harm Depp in her statements.\n\nIn short, this was not a loss for women, or a win for powerful men.  There is nothing to suggest that this will or should harm #MeToo or the ability for women to report abuse.  This was a troubled relationship that fell apart and somebody being held to account for continuing to attack their spouse **after** the relationship had ended.",

It had already traveled around the world twice within a nanosecond and it had a seismic impact on my life and my career.  \nAnd six years later, the jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled.  \nMy decision to pursue this case, knowing very well the height of the legal hurdles that I would be facing and the inevitable, worldwide spectacle into my life, was only made after considerable thought.  \nFrom the very beginning, the goal of bringing this case was to reveal the truth, regardless of the outcome. Speaking the truth was something that I owed to my children and to all those who have remained steadfast in their support of me. I feel at peace knowing I have finally accomplished that.  \nI am, and have been, overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the colossal support and kindness from around the world. I hope that my quest to have the truth be told will have helped others, men or women, who have found themselves in my situation, and that those supporting them never give up. I also hope that the position will now return to innocent until proven guilty, both within the courts and in the media.  \nI wish to acknowledge the noble work of the Judge, the jurors, the court staff and the Sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to get to this point, and to my diligent and unwavering legal team who did an extraordinary job in helping me to share the truth.  \nThe best is yet to come and a new chapter has finally begun.  \nVeritas numquam perit.  \nTruth never perishes.",

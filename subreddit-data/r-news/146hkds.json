We just can\u2019t seem to collectively do what\u2019s necessary,\u201d said Robert Gray, a fire ecologist in British Columbia. \u201cWe know what to do. We\u2019re just not doing it. And there are things we could have done in recent years to lessen what we\u2019ve seen over the last few weeks. \u201d\r  \n\r  \nDowntown Ottawa on Wednesday, shrouded in smoke.  \\[photo description from copying\\] Downtown Ottawa on Wednesday, shrouded in smoke. Photograph: Adrian Wyld/AP\n\n\r  \nIn recent decades, the forestry industry has grown to appreciate the economics of certain fast-growing trees, including the lodgepole pine, says Gray. The species quickly overpopulated forests in western Canada, largely through the replanting efforts of logging companies. But in recent decades, nearly 30m hectares of pine in western North America alone were killed off by the mountain pine beetles, leaving swaths of tinder on the landscape.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTo reduce the scale of these high-severity fires, we need to put a lot more obstructions in the way of potential fire movement. We have to make this transformational change in our landscapes,\u201d said Gray.\r  \n\r  \nHe points to the historical makeup of western Canadian forests, which long been populated by trees of varying age and size: Douglas fir, mountain ash, cedar and spruce. While some trees, like pine, burn easily, others don\u2019t, like the mountain ash or fir. This meant that even in historically dry ecosystems, a diverse canopy has sufficient \u201cspeed bumps\u201d to slow fires, meaning pockets of the land can undergo small wildfires that don\u2019t morph into fearsome blazes.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe can put in vegetation that doesn\u2019t burn that well. In areas where we\u2019ve done prescribed burning, we\u2019ve converted the forest to hardwoods like aspen and cottonwood that don\u2019t burn as well,\u201d he said.\r  \n\r  \nBut he says ambivalence within the forestry industry about embracing a large-scale shift in how it logs and replants, as well as insufficient funding from the provincial and federal governments has delayed efforts experts say can mitigate the most destructive effects of fires.\"",

They were originally uncaring about the protests of aboriginal communities that got in their way, and now the Canadian citizens begging for a change will be essentially ignored as well, even as their communities go up in flames.\n\nPower concedes nothing without demands, and Canadians are going to need to get forceful in elections and protests to make the government take meaningful action.",

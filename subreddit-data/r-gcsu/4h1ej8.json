    "postText": "What is everyone's thoughts on this year at GCSU?\nThe two semesters for me were really different. I'm currently a sophomore (junior after this year) and the two semesters were really different. First semester I hit the sophomore slump in which I had no motivation to do anything. I got my school work done, but did next to nothing socially. Second semester I decided to really put myself out there and I got involved which made me happier although I'm still working on balancing social commitments and schoolwork I am overall more happy.\n\n\nAdvice to upcoming freshman:\nI don't know how many upcoming freshman go on this subreddit, but PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE AND GET INVOLVED! Come Fall 2016 there will be just as many people here starting over and wanting to meet new people. Sit next to someone in class on the first day instead of choosing a seat next to nobody. Start a conversation with them and become friends. \n\nAlso join clubs! The bobcat marketplace happens over the first weekend that all the freshman arrive with all the clubs. Sign your name to all that even kind of interest you. \n\nGreek life! If you think greek life isn't for you, just at least go through rush and see how you like it. I'm not sure how much fall rush costs, but you will be able to go to a ton of events and meet a ton of people. Or if you want to wait, there's always spring rush. I could write paragraphs about the greek life here, but I just wanted to say to try it if you're feeling up for something new. (College is about trying new shit anyways right?)\n\n\nDowntown! Y'all got the dick on this one. Unless you're willing to drop 60-80 bucks for a fake, you aren't gonna be able to get into the bars unless you''re 21. Starting July 1st, you're gonna have to be 21 to enter any bar in Georgia. I still think this law is stupid.\n\n\nProfessors. You'll come across some shitty and great professors. My advice is to take the time to see them at least a couple times a month. Just go there and ask some stupid question about the class if you have nothing else. Getting your name out there is extremely important in order for professors to be lenient on your grades.\n\n\nClasses! I should start by saying there is a difference between college and high school classes. We all bullshitted and flew our way through high school classes, but that won't work optimally here. Speaking from experience, I treated my first college classes as high school classes, and I found myself failing half my classes come 8 weeks into the school year. Shit's not hard if you just learn to study. Take advantage of your 1000 and 2000 level classes. Freshman year, you'll be taking some easier classes. (although it may not seem like it, you'll realize when you get placed in upper levels) Make sure you get As and Bs in these classes, and get yourself a nice cushion for your upper level classes. \n\n\nThese are just some Georgia College related tips for freshman year off the top of my head\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Like OP, I'm a rising junior (Sophomore) \n\nFirst semester I was really lost and a little depressed. My grades were fine, but I was a biology major and genetics really caused me to reconsider my career path. Dropped genetics and worked to improve my grades in my other courses, with mixed results. C in Spanish II and a B in Chem and Chem Lab. A in my GC2Y.\n\nSwitched over to PolySci and couldn't be happier. Got involved with several student organizations and teams on campus, spent a lot more time in the library, and started going to SI and tutoring sessions for my Spanish. Between work, class, and extracurricular organizations, this semester and my upcoming Junior year will be much more busy, but I'm actually excited to learn more and learn from the professors and spend less time hiding away in my dorm. Looking like three As and two Bs.(Still miss video games though. My Steam library calls for me this summer.)  \n\nMy advice for freshmen? NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK Grades are really important, but if you can make friends with and impress your professors, you'll be surprised the sort of opportunities they can give you. This is especially important if you on a career path whose job market is extremely competitive. Just by putting myself out there, several professors have already reached out to me and I can't wait to shadow them.\n\nWhat am I working on? Still my social life. I have friends, but I'd like to have more new experiences and improving my interpersonal skills (concerts, going out to eat, dating, exploring Millidgeville more.) This summer I'm also planning on exercising more to get in better shape, catching up on some reading from my library of unopened books, and making a little change on the side. \n\nTLDR: Last semester was rough, this semester is much better! Happy with the pace of my life, but I still have room for improvement. ",

I'm a biology major and wanted to know if that was a good choice. If anyone would give me their opinions about the professors I have I'd appreciate it. Also we should have a little meetup or something so I can meet people. Thanks guys!",

I've seen a ton of stuff on the new 'end it' club/movement that is an organization to stop human slavery or something. I know the environmental club does a lot of stuff too, and you don't need to be an environmental science major to be in it. And send me your professors, and I can give some input. \n",

The law only affects the people that work at bars for our downtown\n",

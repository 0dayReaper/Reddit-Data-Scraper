Do I need to be able to play piano or have experience in playing some sort of musical instrument?\n\n2. What kind of career can I aim for if I am choosing this as a minor and Mass Communication as a major?\n\n3. Are there any group projects?\n\n4. Who are some good professors for the courses I will be taking?\n\n5. Can I start taking courses for my minor immediately?\n\n6. What kind of software will I be working with in the music technology classes?\n\n7. Is there anyone else taking these courses?\n\nIf anyone else has any advice or wants to share some information, please let me know.  Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "So I guess it's a good coincidence that I happened to see this post because I happened to be a creative music media minor/mass comm major. You're probably going to be the only person at the school with that combo, because I definitely didn't know anyone else who was.\n\nOr anyone else who uses this subreddit (seriously, it's not very active at all, so don't count on it for much of anything)\n\nLike, I'm probably literally the only person that you could possibly reach on this subreddit that might have some answers, so I feel obligated to respond since it seems like some stars must have aligned somewhere for me to run into this question on here.\n\nI'm a recent grad (just this spring), and I was a mass comm major with both a music minor and a creative music media minor. And I legit had occasional issues with Degreeworks in advising because my major/minor combination was close to unheard of. So there's not many or any people that are going to be around with that combo. I know one person who is a mass comm major who I believe is also a music minor, but not creative music media.\n\nAnyways, here's the best answers I can come up with for your questions.\n\n1. I know for sure assuming that the curriculum doesn't change at all that you'll have to take Class Piano I and II. I'm sure they'd be a bit easier if you do have some piano experience, but they are beginner piano classes so you should be okay. However, I would definitely recommend that you try to at least learn the basics of music as soon as you can. I'm not sure if you have any sort of musical background, but if you're asking if you have to know how to play a musical instrument of any sort, I'm assuming that you don't? Theory I will cover a lot of stuff, but if I remember correctly, you should definitely know some basic stuff before going in there or it might move fast. But I don't know if you have that or not, it just seemed like your question might imply that you don't.\n\n2. I'm not really sure of what careers would specifically use both of those things. I'm working towards being a video editor, so that doesn't have really anything to do with either of my music minors, I just had both of those because I like music. Music media and mass comm can fit together in a way that you could possibly do music for video productions or something along those lines. But I haven't really looked into that. And I also don't know what branch of mass comm you're planning on focusing on. This only really applies to the \"hybrid\" side of the mass comm major, which focused more on media creation and journalism. If you're looking to go into PR or advertising, then that's a very different set of mass comm classes compared to the ones I took.\n\n3. For creative music media? Not that I can remember. It was all individual stuff. But that's really up to the professor.\n\n4. Well Dr. Johnson is *the* music theory teacher, so you'll definitely have him. I don't know who's actually doing the music technology classes right now. It kinda switches around a lot. \n\n5. You definitely can, but if you're asking this now you've possibly missed the mark for this year, since Theory I is the first thing you'll need to take and that's only offered in the fall, so you might have to wait until next year to get started on your minor. But you should be okay as long as you start then.\n\n6. We used Apple Garageband for the more introductory stuff, and then later moved on to Avid Pro Tools.\n\n7. You'll definitely have full classes in theory and class piano, because all music majors have to take those. Music technology classes might be kinda small. There was usually about 5 people in those classes when I took them.\n\nHope this helped! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

            "comment": "Yes! Thank you! That helped a lot.  I've been messing around with Presonus Studio One Prime since March so I was very curious about what they were using.  I have just been using the software and creating as a hobby... BUT\n\nAs for what branch I am focusing on,  I think the advertising side of things sounds really interesting to me.  I do have a musical background, though.  I've played in marching band since I was in 8th grade and taught myself how to play a drum set since around the same age.  I'm not surprised that you have not known anyone with the major and minor combo.  I feel that the two connect more than anyone knows!\n\nAnother question I have is about the recitals.  I'm assuming that this will be some sort of portfolio project for Creative Music Media  where you present what you have and explain, but I really don't know exactly.  Can you give some info on the recitals?  ",

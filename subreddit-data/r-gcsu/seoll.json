            "comment": "If you read the article, taking only what you garnered from the reading, it would appear as though a child threw a fit, so the administration immediately called the police who scared the poor child by handcuffing her and taking her to the jail. Sounds about right? Well, that's the media for you. Always leaving out important details, trying to spice up the story. Another story of police brutality, huh? Wrong. Since I reside in Milledgeville, I know what really happened, which is kind of a far stretch from what the media provided. Here's the lowdown:\nFirst off, this is not a racism case. Yes, the child was black, but that had nothing to do with it. The principal that she attacked was black, as was the superintendent.\n\nSecondly, handcuffing and taking the girl to the station was not the first thing the police did. She was kept in the principal's office for a while, during which she knocked over a bookshelf, threw a glass picture frame accross the room, and attempted to attack the principal. Oh, and did I mention that she brandished a sharp pencil and tried to stab a hemophiliac? Plus, it is a mandatory policy that anyone being taken to the jail in a squad car must be cuffed.\n\nThird, it seems as though the parents were not brought into the story until after she was taken to the station. What the media left out was that the parents did not respond to any form of contact and could not be reached in any way.  (The mother later stated that she knew her phone was ringing, but decided it was not important enough to answer it because she was getting low on minutes...  Complete stupidity) As there was no way to keep the girl safe and the other people at the school safe, she had to be taken to the station.\n\n",

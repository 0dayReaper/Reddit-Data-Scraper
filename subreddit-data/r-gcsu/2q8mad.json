    "postText": "I'm trying to get into organic chemistry and its lab for the next semester but I was waitlisted. I spot became available for the lab but not the lecture (there are currently 2 spots open for the lab) and because of that I couldn't get into the lecture. I was wondering why I can't see all of the classes that are offered next semester because if i go to paws--&gt; add or drop--&gt; spring 2015 --&gt; chemistry I only get shown the lab and not the lecture, how do i find both?",

            "comment": "Ugh. This was always so annoying. I graduated in 2012 so I don't know if things still work this way, but email the professor and let him/her know your situation and he/she will most likely tell you to go ahead and attend the class (on the first day) and there will most likely be a few students that don't show up and the prof can add you into the class. Sorry that was a huge run on sentence. Hope it makes sense and good luck! ",

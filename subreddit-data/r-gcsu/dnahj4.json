    "postText": "I\u2019m a big fan of Hibachi Express. Even though this is supposed to be more Japanese than Chinese, they\u2019ve got the best Sesame chicken in town (And I\u2019ve tried a bunch of Chinese restaurants in milly) and it\u2019s under $7. I also like the cheap gas station chicken you can find at gas stations like Golden Pantry. But I was curious, where do you all go whenever you don\u2019t have a lot of money but you want to eat good food?",

Whenever I enter all the info to log into the network (and yes, it's all correct), my phone tells me to manually select a security certificate because it somehow can't on its own. I've gone through EVERY SINGLE ONE ON THE LIST and not one of them has worked. Any advice? What am I doing wrong? I've been burning on data since I got here and I can't use my Echo Dot because she's connected to my phone. It's been getting under my skin and I don't know what else to do.",

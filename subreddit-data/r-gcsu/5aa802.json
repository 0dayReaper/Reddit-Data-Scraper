    "postText": "Hey all,\nI'm a senior in high school, and I'm just finishing up my application for GC. It's currently the #1 school on my list, but I have some questions about student life.\n-Obviously, your social experience at any college will vary depending on how hard you try to make friends, but is there a strong outreach to engage new freshmen in social events?\n-What is the overall presence of Greek life? For any of you that pledged fraternities, what was the experience? Are they as exclusive as other schools make them out to be?\n-Is there a prevalent music scene? I'm a drummer, and would love to be able meet and collaborate with other musicians!\n-Every time I visited, Milledgeville felt like a \"tiny Athens\" to me. Would you say that this comparison is fair?\n-And lastly, how welcoming is the Melee community to newbies?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Here's what I can tell you so far as a freshman. I didn't rush but Greek life is pretty prevalent. Frat parties are honestly the way I met most of the people I know now. Some of them are pretty exclusive but most are welcoming as far as I can tell. I can't speak much for the music scene other than there is a lot of live music downtown on the weekends, not sure if any of them are students or not. And about \"tiny Athens\" thats pretty accurate, but I really enjoy our downtown much more than what I've experienced in Athens. I love it here. If you decide to come, you won't regret it!",

There are usually tables set up at orientation where you can meet people and sign up for things. Everyone is very welcoming! \nGreek life is what you make it. Some are more exclusive than others and you may not make it into the exact one you want. Some may see it as \"unavoidable\" but i didnt see it that way. \nMusic is prevalent. The places dt are always welcome to have new people come play and if you want to find people to play with I am sure you could. \nSmash community is alive and well. If you seek it out, you can find it. Sometimes the dorms will put on tournaments. You think you are good now... just wait. \nGood luck. ",

            "comment": "The thing that I love about GC is that there is a ton of stuff to do on campus if you want to be a part of it. There are a lot of student organizations to choose from and if there isn't one that fits your interests, you can easily start your own club. There are plenty of resources to help you with this. \n\nGreek life is pretty big on campus. I rushed and have loved being a part of a fraternity. Each one is different, and will change depending on the pledge classes that come through. Just keep an open mind and remember that it's not like the movies. \n\nAs far as music goes, I'm not sure. I don't play any instruments, so I never really checked it out. I did have one friend who was really into music and he was part of a band that played pretty frequently downtown. I'm not sure how much you're going to find in Milledgeville gig wise though. \n\nTiny Athens is the most popular way to describe it. I like the downtown area a lot and I like the close nit campus feel. I had a few friends who went to UGA and when I visited them I always felt like the school was shaping everyone and everything, whereas at GC I feel like the students have more ability to shape the campus. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean by Melee community.

            "comment": "I graduated 8 years ago, so my experience may be outdated.\n\nCampus life was okay when I was a student, and a lot of students used to leave town on the weekend, but that was starting to change when I was a student. The experience really was what you made it: find something you're interested in on campus and get involved whether that is Greek Life, volunteering, clubs, or intramurals. It really is the only way to meet people besides your classes. I liked going to the university's concerts, plays, and the local improv comedy at the time (I don't know what the quality is these days though). I had friends who played video games, and the Smash scene was barely getting started back then.\n\nAs you get up into your major, you'll get to know those folks too as your class sizes get smaller.\n\nDowntown Milledgeville is small. Everyone ends up frequenting the same couple of places because there are only a handful in the first place. This was a huge downside for me.\n\nI live in Athens now, and I think the music scene here is far better, but that doesn't mean you can't find some musical folks in Milledgeville. If you can't find folks who are a good fit, Athens isn't too far away to visit!\n\nLastly, if you can help it, continue to live within walking distance of campus. I feel like this was the only way I was able to stay focused and connected to the college and downtown while I was there. I don't think I would have felt a part of the community if I were having to drive to class every day. Besides, parking was a beast when I was there, and unless they built got a parking deck, it probably still is.",

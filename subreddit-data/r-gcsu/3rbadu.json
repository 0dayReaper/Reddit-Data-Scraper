There's no point in going to any of my classes this year, but with the GCSU bullshit attendance policy I have to or i'll fail.\n\nSpeaking of that, it's actually illegal to grade based on attendance, so many professors label it as 'participation'. I talked to a politics &amp; society professor who told me of this. He also told  me there have been lawsuits in other states regarding this",

I've already filled out an application and gotten accepted to the Grove, early enough that I'm at a lower rate than if I signed up now or over the summer. \n\nI really did take a gamble, didn't ask around a lot, but I'm fairly certain that my roommates-to-be are good, so no issues there.

Rent is $525 + power, so you're looking at ~$300 month for housing when you split it. No pets.\n\nI moved out of there this year and into a house 8 miles outside of town. The drive isn't too bad  (10 minutes at worst), the rent is even cheaper, and an awesome dog showed up on my porch right at the start of the semester.",

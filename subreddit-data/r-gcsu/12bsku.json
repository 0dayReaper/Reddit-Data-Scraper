    "postText": "I need help fellow redditors! I found a dog around 10pm tonight.  She's probably about a year old and is not spayed.  No collar.  Boston terrier hound mix, maybe.  She was seen earlier in the evening by my roomie near some residential houses about a mile away from college station, so she's clearly been out and about for a bit.  She has an infected left eye, but other than that she seems healthy and happy.  She's energetic and loving and definitely responds well to humans, so she must be owned.  I need to find someone to foster her or her owner asap! I can't take care of her for more than 24, maybe 48 hours.  And I work so I can't just leave her by herself--I don't know if she's potty trained, and she doesn't even like being out of my sight.  Please help me find her owner.\n\nhttps://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/3733_10151073073760684_1722023243_n.jpg",

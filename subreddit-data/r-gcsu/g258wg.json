    "postText": "Hi! A friend of mine is looking to transfer from UGA as a second year student for the (hopefully, lol) upcoming Fall semester. She has a 2.03 cumulative GPA at UGA currently, but will have a 2.6 once her appeal to retroactively withdraw from a semester goes through. Should she go ahead and submit her application now while she has the 2.03, or wait until she has the 2.6? Will it matter either way? Thanks so much!",

I\u2019m not sure she would get in while transferring with a 2.0. Im not sure what is involved in the transfer process but if there are essays, make sure those are very solid, maybe including why her gpa is low and how she plans to change that. Hope this helps! Sorry, I\u2019m just not really sure how strict the transfer stuff is here, I\u2019m just using my brain lol",

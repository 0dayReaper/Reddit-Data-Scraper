Since tuition is around $4100 if you're enrolled in 15 hours (say 5 3 hour classes), minus a bunch of student fees is like 3200 for only your classes, or about $640 dollars per course you enroll in.  If your class meets twice a week you'll have about 25 classes, or something like that. \n\nSo imagine that each time you attend class you put $25 in a box to be allowed into the room. So if you decide to nap instead, that nap basically just cost you $25 plus the effort of making up that 75 minutes. ",

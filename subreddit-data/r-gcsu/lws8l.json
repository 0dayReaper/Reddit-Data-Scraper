The only issue, is that I've tried to set the sever up a few times and get the port forwarding to work. But, I'm having some issues; I need to get the school sever to accept Minecraft's port forward ID (or whatever you want to call that). I could try talking to serve, but I don't know how they would take it. I'm not the biggest techie either. So if anyone would be willing to help me out, or knows someone in the IT dept. that would be great! \n\nLet's keep this going and try to get one up!",

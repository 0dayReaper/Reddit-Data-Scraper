    "postText": "Hey bobcats! I'm part of a group working on creating a club for secular students. If you're interested, come to Blackbird Coffee at 6pm this Wednesday (April 9th). We're having a preliminary meeting to discuss what we'd like to do with a club and get a constitution set. Also, coffee.\n\nWhat we have so far is that we want to develop a community for atheist, agnostic, questioning, or otherwise secular students. We also want to promote discussion, and we can look into volunteering or community work if our members are interested.\n\nIf you can't make it, like our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gcsussa/) or PM me for details on upcoming meetings.

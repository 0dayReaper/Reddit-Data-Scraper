To fix this issue, you will need to contact your network administrator and have them configure their network to prioritize League of Legends traffic. This usually requires providing a full list of our server IPs and required Ports. For more information, please check out our knowledge base article on connecting through a restricted network (check the bottom of the expanded section):\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/26932010-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq7\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any questions, please feel free to let me know and I\u2019ll do my best to help you out.\n\nDo you think the network administration will bother putting these ports in? Im sick of using a VPN that makes me lag everytime I play..",

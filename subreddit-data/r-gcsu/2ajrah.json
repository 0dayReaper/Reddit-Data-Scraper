Third floor is better than the other three. \n\nFirst has terrible wifi and cell connection, second has the piano, and fourth...well the stairs get annoying some days.",

Make sure to get to know your RA, they can really help you get into the swing of things if you have any questions (If you know them now it will make it less awkward if you get in trouble later). Also, find out when the bingo nights are. They usually happen once a month in one of the dorm buildings (usually Sanford or Adams) and they have great prizes and free food. ",

    "postText": "There's an event to raise hunger awareness being held in the banquet area of the Max tonight, Thursday, at 7:00.  People are arbitrarily designated an income tier and a meal depending on it.  That's rice, rice and beans, or even a three course meal.  It's completely free, and should be a good experience.",

I'm sure it still happens, but I don't know anyone still in high school, so I wouldn't recognize them if I saw them downtown.",

It used to be in the Kmart shopping center, and although it was still open 24 hours back then, I never really went there much because the store was so small. So, Walmart was where I habitually went. The new Kroger is great for certain things, but because of the prices and the convenience I still generally go to Walmart.",

We're also not full of backwards redneck hicks like a lot of people think about the town.\n\nHaving lived here all my life, either I'm unaware of a lot of stereotypes that are more prevalent in other parts of Georgia (I don't know much of what people in Atlanta or North Georgia or South Georgia think of my town), or I've just become so used to living here that I don't even notice the town conforming to a stereotype. Being the only town I've ever lived in, Milledgeville is what I regard as normal.\n\nWhat stereotypes do you hear about Milledgeville? I'll try and say whether or not they're true, lol",

    "postText": "So, i applied to GCSU back in december and i got invited for an interview for summer bridge. I already know alot about it. I'm just worried about whether or not i'll get into the program following the interview. GCSU is most definitely my top college and i'd really like to get in somehow. this seems like my best bet. If anybody has any insight on the program, i'd love to chat with you.",

My core group of friends through out college and Post graduation have all been from bridge, we gained others along the way but majority of us met in bridge. Such an awesome experience to start school early, get familiar with campus, meet tons of new people and be at the school you want to be at!",

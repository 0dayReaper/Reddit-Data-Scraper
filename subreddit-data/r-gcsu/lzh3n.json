For now we're running bukkit, so if you have any suggestions for server mods then put them in this thread.\n\nAlso, if you like you can introduce yourself in the thread if you intend on playing a bunch. \n\nOn the server my name is Alphabasic, my name is Sam and I'm a senior Accounting Major with a minor in Management Information Services. I'm a part of our schools Association of Information Technology Professionals and I've been playing Minecraft since early Alpha.",

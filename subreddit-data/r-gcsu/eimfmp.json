            "comment": "I did it this past summer. \n\nBasically in the interview, be yourself, brag about yourself, and treat it like a job you want. Biggest thing is being involved in the community so make sure you either are already doing that or say you plan on doing that. \n\nIn the actual program you start out with a student success class that is 6 hours a day for three days but has a lunch break in the middle. This class is essentially team building and ice breakers. You have your two main classes. Both are 3 hours. One in the morning, lunch, then one after lunch. Don\u2019t focus on the work itself but more of how to do it. I took one class that assigned online reading every night but because of the teacher, you didn\u2019t have to read shit. The other class, however, you had to do all the assignments and if not, pray. \n\nOverall it feels like a summer camp cause of all the team building they incorporate into it. In the end I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it cause you get to make good friends and you also get 7 credit hours out of it so depending on your degree, that can check some boxes for required classes. Just finishing my first semester I can tell you that bridge is harder in terms of living. I mean that by 6 hours a day and homework all 5 days a week with two weeks worth of info each day. Managing time and learning to physically live by that schedule is my biggest take away aside from learning how to take the classes. When you start the first semester, down time will be plenty and the classes will be so much easier. \n\nIt may sound scary at first but consider this, you get a lot of benefits from it and you get your own room to sleep in\n\nGo bobcats!",

The interview was like any other, but know specific stories you want to tell that can be applicable to many different types of questions. It\u2019s a very \u201cstory based\u201d interview. The program itself isn\u2019t horrible, you\u2019re in class for a long time but it kind of flies by regardless. I\u2019d say that if you want to go to Georgia College, it\u2019s a good move to do the Bridge Program. (You also get to live in the village apartments which is pretty cash money).",

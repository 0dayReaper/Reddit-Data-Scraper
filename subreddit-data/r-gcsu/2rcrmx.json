I think we could actually get one together, watch splits, lcs, play together, etc. From the amount of people that I've managed to talk to on campus alone it seems to me like we may be able to get one together.\n\nIll be checking this subreddit and this post somewhat frequently. Lets make this happen!\n\nEDIT: Already have 3 people interested, awesome. I will look into actually getting this started sometime after I get back on campus.\n",

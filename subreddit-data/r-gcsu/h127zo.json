    "postText": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, GC has released a revised schedule for Fall 2020. The TL;DR is as follows:\n\n\\- Classes begin on Wednesday, August 12.\n\n\\- Fall break (typically sometime in mid-October) is cancelled.\n\n\\- Last day of in-person classes is Tuesday, November 24.\n\n\\- Once classes finish up on the 24th, you go home for Thanksgiving break and stay home.\n\n\\- All finals (Dec 1-4) will be online.\n\nNo word as far as graduation or convocation yet. For full details on the Fall 2020 schedule, visit the [Registrar's website](https://www.gcsu.edu/registrar/academic-calendars). This calendar is subject to change, so keep an eye out for announcements from official GC channels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe official statement from President Dr. Steve Dorman (Released 6/10/2020) is below:\n\n&gt;Dear Bobcats,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The health and safety of Georgia College students, faculty, and staff is of the utmost concern for the university. Out of an abundance of caution, and due to continued concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia College will amend the fall semester academic calendar.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fall classes will begin Wednesday, August 12, instead of the originally scheduled date of Monday, August 17. Fall break, originally set for October 12-13, has been removed from the calendar.\u00a0 The last day of classes will be Tuesday, November 24. \u00a0Final exams will begin Tuesday, December 1, after the Thanksgiving break and will take place online.\u00a0 The full revised academic calendar is available [here](https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gcsu.edu%2Fregistrar%2Facademic-calendars&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cmichael.gillett%40GCSU.EDU%7C8d6890da0c7942ad348608d80d34b599%7Cbfd29cfa8e7142e69abc953a6d6f07d6%7C0%7C0%7C637273867344555485&amp;sdata=EJ3pMLUitB8EkwPo%2B7DrF%2FY6f4b%2BDKZVzFB0VeNJj%2FM%3D&amp;reserved=0), and the[\u00a0final exam schedule here.](https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gcsu.edu%2Fregistrar%2Ffinal-exam-schedule&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cmichael.gillett%40GCSU.EDU%7C8d6890da0c7942ad348608d80d34b599%7Cbfd29cfa8e7142e69abc953a6d6f07d6%7C0%7C0%7C637273867344555485&amp;sdata=LSPU9vBSxSKQggbv7ZIjuMkYJb3GfYfmLuoyqlgDHZo%3D&amp;reserved=0)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The goal of these changes\u00a0is to ensure learning continues while limiting the potential spread of COVID-19 by reducing travel to and from campus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This new calendar has been reviewed and approved by the University System of Georgia and is supported and endorsed by the Georgia College academic administration.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;More details on the university housing plan and move-in date procedures will be shared as soon as possible.\u00a0 I truly appreciate your continued support.\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sincerely,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Steve",

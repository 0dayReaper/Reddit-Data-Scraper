I did it for 2 semester and it\u2019s got very flexible hours - you even get paid to go sit in on the class that you\u2019ve already taken before. I also worked at the Rec Center for a semester. It\u2019s not bad - pretty easy and not too bad shift wise when I was there. Plus a lot of co workers would pay you extra money to take their shift. Good luck!",

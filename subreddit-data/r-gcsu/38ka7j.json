    "postText": "Hey!\n\n[Camp to Belong Georgia](http://camptobelong-ga.org/), a summer camp that re-unites siblings who have been separated by the foster care system, needs your help. Several of our counselors have had emergencies come up, and cannot attend camp this year, so we need a few more helping hands. If you can make the time, please consider volunteering with us this summer!\n\nCamp will be held Saturday, June 13, to Friday, June 19, and is held at the awesome [Camp Twin Lakes](http://www.camptwinlakes.org/) in Warm Springs, GA. You don't need to have any special skills or magic powers to be a counselor - just a love for working with kids!\nSo write the boss an email, make some space in your schedule, and join us. It WILL be the best week of your summer, I guarantee it. \n\nIf you have questions or want to learn more, just ask!\n\nEdit:\n\nI've had a couple of PMs, and want to clarify a few things.\n\nIf you would like to volunteer with us, you MUST go through the [counselor application](http://camptobelong-ga.org/registration.htm) on the website. We cannot accept drop in counselors, and you must go through the background check and related processes.\n\nIf you can't commit to a whole week, consider being a day volunteer. These volunteers help us set up and carry out activities, provide breaks for our full week volunteers, and much more! \n\nIf you'd like to help out, but can't make it this year, consider donating. We are a 501c3 organization, and can always donations of [funds](http://camptobelong-ga.org/sponsor.htm) or [supplies](http://camptobelong-ga.org/wishlist.htm) to support camp. \n\nSee our [Xpost on r/atlanta](http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/38jot8/last_minute_volunteer_opportunity/) for more details.",

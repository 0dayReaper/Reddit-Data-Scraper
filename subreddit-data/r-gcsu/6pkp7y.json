Our club is based around playing Super Smash Brothers Melee, a fighting game with a thriving scene in Georgia and all around the globe. \n\nYou can join our Facebook group at - https://www.facebook.com/groups/GcsuSmash/\nFrom this page you can find information about meetups, the game itself, and how to get in contact with other group members. \n\nI hope to see a lot of new faces come and enjoy playing Smash with a passionate, talented, and most of all accepting group of  GCSU students! Thanks guys :D",

    "postText": "This is just a rambly post from a throwaway account. Was just feeling nostalgic and wanted to post something here.\n\nI graduated from GCSU 6 years ago with an accounting degree. I also have many friends that graduated with me - some business majors but most of them not (psychology, poli sci, language majors, etc.) We've all achieved various levels of success since then so this post is to talk about that and other thoughts on the school.\n\nFirst of all, my overall experience at GCSU was positive. I was a smart kid from the Atlanta suburbs who didn't really know what he wanted to do with his life. The first thing you'll notice about GCSU is that it attracts two types of people generally:\n\n1) Middle to upper-middle class Atlanta suburb kids and\n2) People who grew up in middle GA and wanted to get a degree.\n\nNot true for everyone but that was my experience. This means that there is an interesting mix of suburb kids and more \"hick\" folks. I personally enjoyed this a lot. There is a lot of \"southern charm\" in the campus itself. With my personality, I know I wouldn't have graduated from a big school. The small class sizes and approachable professors were a huge reason I was able to graduate. There are some amazing professors here - too many to list. Tom Moore specifically is why I decided to pursue accounting and he is literally the best teacher I ever had.\n\nA lot of people reading this might be in high school and are curious if this is a good fit and what you're job prospects will be like. Here is my perspective: like everything in life, you get as much as you put in. If you select a good major, work hard, get internships, then GCSU will help you succeed. If you dick around and major in something less marketable then you will have a tough time. This is universal for all schools.\n\nOut of my group of friends that graduated I'd say about half are doing great. I'm a manager at a large accounting firm ($100k+ /year). Another friend is an HR manager (psych major, business minor) at a large corporation ($90k+ /year) - both in Atlanta. Another friend moved to Chicago and works at a Big 4. One thing in common is that GCSU didn't really help us in getting internships or jobs starting out - as in we applied to positions ourselves and didn't use the schools resources. You'll learn quickly that a lot of people had never heard of the school and that GCSUs career fairs tend to have a lot of sale positions (insurance, etc). It's depressing when you're filling out an online job application that has a drop-down menu with a list of schools and yours isn't on there.\n\nMost of my other friends did not get jobs related to their majors. Another friend with a psych degree with 2.0 GPA at best is doing entry-level tech support. French major ended up in sales since he couldn't get his foot in the door teaching french at public schools. Friend with a poli sci major ended up working at TSA at the airport. History major ended up working as a security guard. Most of these folks were average students - 3.0 GPA at best. No internships at graduation. Nothing really to give them an edge. Keep in mind that when we graduated when the economy was still recovering.\n\nThe GCSU name alone will not get you jobs like GA Tech and UGA. With that said, I've noticed that firms (at least in my industry) are starting to give GCSU more attention due to positive experiences with alumni.\n\nThis is just my experience obviously.  This post is not about bashing GCSU. Again, my experience was great - I made good friends, discovered a major, and graduated. Just wanted to give my 2 cents.",

If you have a liberal arts degree like Poly Sci, psycology, language, etc you HAVE to hustle, be flexible with the sort of job you are applying too, and do not expect much of a salary without a masters or any other grad program.\n",

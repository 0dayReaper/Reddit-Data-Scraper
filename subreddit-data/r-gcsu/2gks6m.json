Im fine whenever Im in my dorm as I have an ethernet cable, but I cant do shit on my phone except for texting/calling over 2G. Today has been especially worse. Why the fuck is the internet so bad when other colleges get wifi that we could only dream of. GC needs to get their shit together if they expect people to pay as much as they are asking",

The only thing that I have learned to make it better is to look for the wireless access points and get near them(the white squares with blue lights). That is the ONLY way for you to get fast wifi. If you're outside and using the wifi, good luck, it's not going to get any better. ",

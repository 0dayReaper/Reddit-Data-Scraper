            "comment": "Im the Treasurer for AAC on campus and we run monthly events. We're having a handful of chapters pop up in different colleges around Georgia (Moorhouse, UGA, Middle Georgia College) and the tips we give them are to find a team of 4 to 5 *really* committed people to be your Executive Board. Once you have that team, start you guys need to start your first project. \n\nFocus on one large-ish event for that first semester your organization is operating (e.g. If you wanted to make a competitive gaming club, have your Exec Board plan and execute one big gaming event for the semester that is well advertised and well ran). Once you get that first event completed during your first semester as a club, you guys will pretty much have the experience to run monthly or bi-monthly events. \n\nOnce these monthly (or weekly, whatever you do) events are in motion, you guys will start picking up regulars that come to the event every month (think about acoustic night, and improv night every week at Blackbird, 50 people come out to these events every week, but the secret is that it's pretty much the same 50 people coming every week.) But don't forget, if you want those same fifty people to come out to your event every week or month, you still have to advertise before every event. Chalking sidewalks and fliers at every dorm. Also, facebook (of course). \n\nI wish I could help you with the paperwork on the school's side, but Ive never set up an organization myself when it comes to petitioning the administration for officially being a club on campus. But if you need any more help or if you have any more questions, I will do my best to answer them. I've helped run AAC for about half a year now, and help set up and execute events on a monthly basis, all with fairly well reception.\n\nI hope this helps.",

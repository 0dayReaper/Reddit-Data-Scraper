The reason I am writing this post is that for the past few weeks, I have been receiving emails from NCSA Basketball trying to contact a 'Kevin'. The last name was not mentioned in these emails, but from other emails I have received from ridgewater.edu by a Dennis Boe, I deduced that the full name was Kevin Marrs.\n\nIf one knows a Kevin Marrs that plays basketball, could you please contact them and ask them to contact NCSA basketball? I have already emailed both NCSA basketball and Bridgewater notifying of the error and have asked them to find the actual 'Kevin' but am posting this here just in case.",

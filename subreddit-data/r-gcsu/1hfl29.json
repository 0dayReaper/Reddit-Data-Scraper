Go to a movie, chill out at the library &amp; read a book. Hell, talk to the locals and see if they know of anything exciting happening.",

I got lucky this summer by having several friends stay here the whole time.\n\nDowntown isn't dead over the summer. Karaoke at Buffington's is popular, and Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights are still busy. Late night runs to Waffle House, Taco Bell, Krystal, or even Kroger or Walmart can be fun.\n\nThen again, I grew up here, so this is all I've ever known during the summer. Someone who grew up in a much larger city with more to do during the summer would obviously find Milledgeville more boring than I do.",

    "postText": "Wasn't a big fan at all. I still don't really see why they chose this book. It would be great for fans of the 80s, but other than that it was quite boring. Had to force myself to read through the first 200 pages before it started to pick up somewhat. \n\n\n\nDoes anyone know what we are going to be doing with this book? It was one of the first books I've read outside the classroom in 2ish years. ",

We went to a couple group discussions but didn't talk about it much other from that. \n\nI think it's meant to act as a common ground for new students to have something to talk about and act as some kind of basic lesson about being in a new situation.",

You can find more information at the T[esting Center's website](https://www.gcsu.edu/testingcenter/test-offerings-center-for-testing). I passed both exams on the first go. Just read the whole packet, highlight what you think is important, and then review it in the days leading up to the test. You'll do just fine.",

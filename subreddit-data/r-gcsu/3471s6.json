If not, then ask them where you should go to next. If you know of an office on campus or a specific job that you would like to work in, then just go to that office and let them know you're looking for work. Good luck!",

So a lot of it depends on how much you make and how much you can work. Some offices are limited to how many hours student employees can work. ",

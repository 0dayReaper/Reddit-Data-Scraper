Potentially, the use of a mega thread could be used to share content, similar to the way the twitter account did a few years ago. Since r/gcsu is unofficial, I am open to the idea. Please feel free to share any thoughts, ideas, or suggestions. \n\nFor those out of the loop,  https://twitter.com/Blackout_Bobcat",

I'll speak to the other mods for their thoughts but a mega thread for black out bobcats opens up a whole mess of potential issues for moderation down the road. Plus, I personally have some ethical concerns with the whole notion. ",

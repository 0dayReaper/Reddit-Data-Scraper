There's not going to be a lot in the events section, there are some plays and things like jazz concert, but pretty much are all at the college. \n\nYou can do a few other things, like take a trolley tour, or a ghost tour. You may be able to get a tour of central state I'm not sure if they still do those anymore.\n\nOutdoor places are the riverwalk, less developed riverwalk behind the dam, totally undeveloped bartram forest, couple other nature ish places around the lake, there's a waterfall @ murder creek and flat rock which are cool but a bit out of town.\n\nThat's getting close to everything... so basically you can go hang around in nature, then go get something to eat, and either go to a bar or possibly some sort of event if there is one at that time.",

The undisputed nicest restaurant in Milledgeville is Aubri Lane's downtown as well. Then maybe go take a walk at the greenway, just like a mile from there? Good luck!",

He would always wander around downtown with crazy unkempt beard and hair usually wearing a Hawaiian style shirt and had huge 90s style headphones on.  He would also wander up to parties all the time.  He came up to my place several times when we were all outside, but he never caused any trouble, so we let him hang out, but he was definitely a strange dude. ",

    "postText": "Hey I'm supposed to sign up for classes tomorrow, and I am currently planning on transferring to another school after next semester. I am not 100% sure on what Physics class I need to take as a prerequisite before I go into the other program at the other school. I called the registrar at the other school but he wasnt there and he is supposed to call me back tomorrow evening. However, I need to sign up for the class ASAP in case people take the class up, etc. There are two Physics classes that could be the one that I'm signing up for; would it be frowned upon or not allowed for me to sign up for both physics classes tomorrow morning and then when I find out which one I need to be in I drop the other?",

Sign in to PAWS, go to TAIL (right under CATS), get state, pick college, and it should have a list of classes that match up. I'm not sure if that will help, but it never hurts to try!",

Depending on the other school, Paws may show you what they'll accept, and subsequently, which course you need at GC that would transfer directly over to it. Worst case scenario, the class you take here will translate into some core requirement at the other school. Best of luck with your future endeavors!",

Others I'll prolly part out for some quick cash. I promised my roommate that we'd office space the fuck out of one of them (if you haven't seen that movie, you should watch it just for the printer scene alone). Some of the funds are going towards a new build, but most of it will go towards our liquor fund for next year. ",

    "postText": "I' ll just cut to the chase... my GPA isn't the best but I have pretty solid recommendations, essays, and my SAT scores aren't here yet but they shouldn't be too bad. Will my GPA weigh me down? It's a 2.2 but I'm taking 4 APs this semester (and aiming for all As) so by the time I apply it should be a 2.5 at the least. If diversity helps at all, I'm a first generation American/student &amp; racial minority. What do you guys think? Thank you :)",

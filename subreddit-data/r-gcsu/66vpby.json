            "comment": "There's a nice park (usually referred to as the Greenway) just outside of town. Walking trails, physical fitness area for GMC, a dog park, and access to the river all in one place. If you want somewhere inside to hang out with friends, I spent a lot of time playing pool/ping pong in the Den my freshman year. \n\nYou can check out every place downtown in under 2 hours and get an idea of what each restaurant/bar is like. Check out the antique shops for sure, you never know what little things you'll see for $2.\n\nThere's also a neat museum in the basement of Herty Science building that's usually completely empty, and it includes a small planetarium. I've never actually been in to see a presentation, just to relax/work in peace between classes.",

            "comment": "As an employee and avid supporter, I say start with the library. A lot of people (myself included) shy away from it and only think of it as a over-glorified printing station their freshman year. I love exploring the upstairs and digging through the vinyls and music scores, as well as the philosophy section. There's just a lot of really good books to get a hold of, and our Special Collections is awesome (we have the torch from the '96 Olympics, last I checked.)\n\nThere are a ton of antique stores downtown that are owned by some great people, always worth a stop.\n\nA lot of people have said the Mines, Bartrum, the Greenway and Soccer Mountain. One I really loved was Lake Laurel. It's a little past 97.7's post, but it's beautiful, especially in the colder months. Just watch out, there are gators (I've never seen them but they're there.) Took an old girlfriend out there and felt like it was one of the best spots I took her during our relationship. Also, Andalusia is one of the best historic spots to go to, it's just amazing. Soak in the local history.\n\nApparently our bowling alley is affordable, compared to Macon/anything up North. \n\nFinally, even if you're not a bar person, downtown is currently budding with some awesome music, both during regular hours and late at night. Support the local scene when you come down, and you'll get treated right.  \n\nSource: Local and graduating Senior; I'm gonna miss this town.",

            "comment": "Bartram Forrest south of town. It is a WMA managed by the Ga Forestry Department. It covered over 1,000 acres of planted pine trees with the occasional section of hard wood.  It has some well maintained service roads you can hike on, a few hiking specific trails and they're currently in the process of adding 10 miles of mountain biking trails for the Georgia Military College's mountain biking team. \n\nRight across the road from the main parking lot at Bartram there is the Selma Irwin mountain biking loop that is a 4 mile long loop around one of the state ponds. It is well marked and a fun little hike. \n\nSoccer Fields off 22, also called sun set field it's a fun place to go hang out with friends throwing the frisbee, kicking a soccer ball, etc.  \n\nMacon is a short 35min drive or so that has tons more shopping/parks to check out and explore too. I liked to head over there the last few years to take my girlfriend on nicer dates (always nice to switch up the food choices for once), shopping, parks, etc. \n\nThe lake is super close to town so that's fun to hang around when it's warm. \n\nThe Kaolin mines over towards Sandersville are really pretty and an a white girl Instagram dream. White chalkish substance that creates these rich rich ice blue pools. Be careful because most are on private land/ in use and very dangerous to swim in. Just don't trespass to see them and you'll be okay. \n\n\n\nOverall my best advice is don't be afraid to ask around when you get there! Someone always has something fun to do and loves to share! Congrats on your acceptance and go bobcats! I sure will miss it when I graduate next month! ",

            "comment": "Ever wanted to see Milledgeville from a different view? Interested in flying? Looking for a group activity? Come take a discovery flight over Milledgeville! A 30-minute flight, for up to three people for only $60!!! The lucky front seat passenger will be able to take over and fly around a little. Lake Sinclair and downtown Milledgeville never looked better than from the sky! I highly recommend checking out Milledge Aviation.\n\nRoller Rocket Rink, GC&amp;SU students get a discount and it is a fun place to try out. For a few more bucks you can get a wristband to use the inflatables (worth it). The music when I went was probably on the top hip hop songs on Spotify. The light displays were decent. I recommend paying for inline skates and the inflatables. Great place to go with friends, or with a date. ",

Even if you're not a Flannery fan, the farm and house is still beautiful. They hold Thursdalusia open mic events on Thursday evenings from 5-sunset April through September. There's also some great walking trails out there, and great picnic spots.\n\nAlso, still pitching hanging out at Special Collections and the library! ",

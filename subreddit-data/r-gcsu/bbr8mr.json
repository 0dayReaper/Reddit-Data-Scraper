    "postText": "To all of our seniors graduating this May, congratulations! Graduation can be a busy time of year, so here a few notes for the upcoming festivities. A lot of the information for both the Graduate and Undergraduate commencements are the same, but be mindful of which ceremony you'll be attending since there are three in total.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pre-Commencement Notes:**\n\n* The Spring 2019 Graduation Fair takes place on April 15 from 1 - 5:30 pm and April 16 from 10 am - 2 pm in Donahoo Lounge. This is when you will pickup your graduation tickets \\[[1](https://www.gcsu.edu/sites/files/page-assets/node-1335/attachments/commencement_spring_graduate_2019-01-25.pdf)\\]. If you need more tickets than you were originally allotted, visit [Bobcat Exchange.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2201735478/) Be sure that if you're buying tickets that you get them for the correct graduation ceremony, as there are three.\n* Pre-ordered regalia (such as caps, gowns, stoles, etc.) may also be picked up starting April 17 from the GC Bookstore downtown \\[[1](https://www.gcsu.edu/sites/files/page-assets/node-1335/attachments/commencement_spring_graduate_2019-01-25.pdf)\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Commencement Notes:**\n\n* In order to participate in the commencement ceremonies, all graduating students are required to wear a gown, green or blue collar stole, cap, and black tassel.

This will have a seating map that shows where each college will be seated during the ceremony.\n* All commencement ceremonies will take place at the Georgia College Centennial Center. Parking is available at the Centennial Center, Irwin Street, or the Depot. Shuttles will run every 5 minutes starting two hours prior and one hour after each commencement ceremony \\[[1](https://www.gcsu.edu/sites/files/page-assets/node-1335/attachments/commencement_spring_graduate_2019-01-25.pdf)\\].\n* The **Graduate Commencement Ceremony** begins at 6:45 pm on Friday, May 10, 2019.

Please know that Georgia College places the highest priority on the safety of everyone on campus, and we are closely monitoring the situation as it unfolds. We are coordinating efforts closely with the University System of Georgia and are reviewing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as well as the Georgia Department of Public Health.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have created a website ([https://www.gcsu.edu/coronavirus](https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gcsu.edu%2Fcoronavirus&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cbrittiny.johnson%40gcsu.edu%7Cc5570995b501460d9da308d7c0a54563%7Cbfd29cfa8e7142e69abc953a6d6f07d6%7C0%7C0%7C637189688413384936&amp;sdata=eXraDu5FA4uE3Rb1k6inz4uu7QUL6iikduud5IyJmAg%3D&amp;reserved=0)) that provides the latest updates on the coronavirus as it relates to our campus.

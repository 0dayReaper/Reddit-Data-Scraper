    "postText": "So I got accepted into the bridge scholars program at gcsu. Im majoring in business. I have other places im looking at. I heard that the classes are relatively easy, but I\u2019ve also seen that it\u2019s a high school 2.0. Is the social life any good during the program? Any general updated reviews? What is RA like for the apartements? Thanks",

It was pretty cool to \u201cgo to college\u201d before everyone else and get to know the campus and Milly in general before the rest of the students. When Fall semester came around I already had made great friends and had a sense of where stuff was on campus, etc. I still talk to and hang out with friends I made at Bridge to this day. I didn\u2019t personally get the sense that it was high school 2.0 but I understand everyone\u2019s experience could be different.",

From what I remember there are 3 or 4 floors total and you can take the stairs or the elevator. You need a key card to get in (it\u2019ll be your GC student ID) and the apartments are actually really nice (they may be even better from when I was first there in 2011). They have 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms so you may have to share with another person but the rooms are a good size imo and so are the bathrooms- toilet and shower are separate from the sink and the living room is spacious. They were furnished when I was there so I assume they are still that way today.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention there are also laundry rooms on each floor so you can do your laundry and it didn\u2019t cost anything (at least in 2011).",

Starting that fall semester with a few dozen pals, knowing your way around campus, getting into a class to see a familiar face from the summer. All in all such a great experience. I\u2019m still very close with a bunch of pals I made through bridge.\n\nAlso- I found that during the summer you got the chance to become close with some other upperclassmen that might have been taking summer courses that year. It\u2019s not paramount but it was nice having some sage advice from other students, getting to know some of the bar staff/teachers etc in a more relaxed setting.\n\nI say go for it!! I\u2019m so glad I did.",

            "comment": "I know I am kind of late but I did bridge last summer and I had a different experience. The classes that you take are B.S. classes (I took Philosophy and music and conflict) I am a nursing major so that's not really what I want to study, The rooming situation is not great you don't take a quiz or anything that pairs you up they just kind of stick you with anyone. I personally got roommates with that I don't vibe that well and we don't really talk. However, I do know people who have roomed with great people and are living together again next year. It is a lot like high school but you are not allowed to leave and you're not allowed to have visitors for the first couple of weeks. They do fun events like painting, jewelry making, sex ed, mini golf, dive-in movie, etc. The RA is on each floor and you also have a peer mentor that will guide you through the process of college. It does kind of suck missing your last summer before you start college but I know lots of people who have made some of their best friends or there worst enemies. Definitely try and talk to as many people as you can and it can be a great time!",

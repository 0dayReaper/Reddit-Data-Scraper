            "comment": "I am getting ready to leave my place in the white apartments on the corner of Clarke and Franklin, by the back entrance to the grove. I have lived here for the past two years and have really liked it. \n\nBefore this I lived at Magnolia Park, apartment was poorly built, took forever to have maintenance done, and they screwed me on move out. The pool was always filthy as well. That experience led me to finding a smaller apartment/house in town.\n\nMy current land lord is great, they never bother me, never need to come see the unit, very friendly when I come by to pay rent, etc. With utilities(internet and electric) I pay about $700. Keep in mind, I live alone in a two bedroom unit, so it could be a lot lower; rent is $575 a month for the whole unit. \n\nAnother thing to consider about larger complexes is that most of them rent by room, not unit. So if you have a roommate that moves out, they can move whoever they want in to your apartment. This has happened to my SO and they are currently extremely unhappy with their living situation because of the new roommate. Just something to think about.\n\n\n",

People are always looking for roommates and places to live.\n\nI have a few friends who live in the trailers by the Grove, behind the main dorms. If you can snag one of those, they're relatively cheap and are 2B2B. The only con is no pets that don't live in a tank. (My friend is trying to pass on her lease currently, don't know if she found someone or not.)\n\nYou could stay in the dorms, but I feel everyone needs to live on their own to develop to be more adult-y in life. My best advice is look for a good apartment, and ask people around town what works as well. The downtown crowd knows some special places that are steals.",

The grove has a pool and gym(both are nice to have in walking distance). \nI currently live at college station and it is terrible. The property manger is incompetent. She charged me electricity overrages for 4 months of a broken AC unit. We put in numberous work orders, and they did nothing. College Station employees mainly college kids and they do their best but don't have much to work with.\nI recommend talking to residents who currently live where you are thinking about living to get the real scope. \n\nTLDR if you want to live in an apartment with broken AC and get 120$ overages monthly, College Station is for you!",

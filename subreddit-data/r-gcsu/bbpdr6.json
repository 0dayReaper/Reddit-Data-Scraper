            "comment": "The school usually hosts a graduation fair sometime in mid-April where you pick up your cap, gown and chords (if applicable). I think they also give you your tickets that day as well. Looks like it's going to be on April 16th this year. [https://frontpage.gcsu.edu/announcement/gc-spring-graduation-fair-0](https://frontpage.gcsu.edu/announcement/gc-spring-graduation-fair-0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for what to bring to the ceremony, I think all you need to walk is a cap, gown, and tassel to wear on top of business attire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: this is from [Georgia College's Commencement Information PDF](https://www.gcsu.edu/sites/files/page-assets/node-1335/attachments/commencement_spring_undergraduate_2019-01-25.pdf):\n\n&gt;**Graduation Fairs**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To assist you in preparing for commencement, we will have two graduation fairs  \n&gt;  \n&gt;during the Spring semester. The first will be held on February 6 (1:00-5:00 p.m.) and 7  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(10:00-2:00 p.m.) at Barnes &amp; Noble at Georgia College. At that time, you will be able  \n&gt;  \n&gt;to order regalia, announcements, and other graduation merchandise. You may also  \n&gt;  \n&gt;order these items online (instructions below).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The second graduation fair will be held on April 15 (1:00-5:30 p.m.) &amp; 16 (10:00-2:00) in  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the Donahoo Lounge. At this fair, undergraduate students will be able to pick up their  \n&gt;  \n&gt;commencement tickets. Pre-ordered regalia may also be picked up beginning April 17  \n&gt;  \n&gt;from Barnes &amp; Noble at Georgia College.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Regalia**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In order to participate in commencement, undergraduate students are required to  \n&gt;  \n&gt;wear a bachelor's gown, green or blue collar stole, cap and black tassel. Students will  \n&gt;  \n&gt;not be allowed to participate in the ceremony if they are not attired appropriately.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Regalia will be available for online purchase through Oak Hall beginning in  \n&gt;  \n&gt;January. The deadline for online ordering is Sunday, March 10. After this date, regalia  \n&gt;  \n&gt;must be purchased directly from Barnes &amp; Noble at Georgia College. Delivery for out-of-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;town students can be requested for an additional fee and must be ordered on or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;before Thursday, April 4.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Students may also borrow all or part of their regalia from recent GC graduates rather  \n&gt;  \n&gt;than purchasing their own items.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;U.S. military personnel may wear appropriate military dress uniforms in lieu of  \n&gt;  \n&gt;regalia. Regalia should not be worn over military uniform.",

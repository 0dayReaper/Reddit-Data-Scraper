You are more prone to receive a stern talking to and/or a fine than anything else.\n\nThe place is really cool. A must-see at least once if you live in Milledgeville for 4 years.",

Just a heads up for exploring old places like this. \n\n[Hantavirus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002358/)\n\nYou should check out the old State Prison off of Hwy 22. It had Georgia's first electric chair. Unfortunately, it is a recycling/junk yard place now. I think they may have security 24/7, but its been awhile since I have been around there.",

All the furniture has been removed but a lot of the more technical equipment is still there. There's no graffiti in this building, nor is there a lot of trash or any squatters. If you're bored and go to GCSU or GMC, check this place out.",

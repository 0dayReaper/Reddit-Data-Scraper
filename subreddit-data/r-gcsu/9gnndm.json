    "postText": "Hello everyone, sorry that I not a student but I could not find a better way of contacting the people of Milledgeville, if anybody is not happy with my post I can delete it. I represent a small Fiber Internet Service Provider (10K+ clients) from Brazil and we are planning on expanding our services to the US. We thought that Milledgeville would be a good city to start our services. We will be able to provide speeds up to 1000Mbps and a much better stability then Cable. For that we would like the help from the people of Milledgeville, we would like to know if you are happy with your ISP, if not, why are you not happy? But the most important information is about utility poles, we need to know if they belong to the city or to the current ISP, otherwise we won't be able to lay down our cables. We are a \"not evil\" type of ISP, our managers and technicians will be on the city, so if you have a problem you don't call a number to talk to some random person that will not solve your problems, you can walk some blocks and talk directly to us! We really hope that we can give real fast and stable internet to the city and any information about permits would be of great value, if anybody have any questions, please feel free to ask, my name is Augusto.

The main problem in US is laying our cables, the companies that own the poles charges ridiculous amounts of money to use them, but sometimes the city owns them, and we can use them more easily.",

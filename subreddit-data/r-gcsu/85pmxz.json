    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m an incoming freshman at GCSU, and I\u2019m trying to decide whether to live at the central campus or the west campus. Living right by all my classes and the dining hall would be great, but I also frequent the gym and enjoy quality internet, so each campus has its benefits for me personally. I\u2019m leaning towards central campus, because class is the most important thing, and I can just take a bus when I need to go the gym. Do you all have any wisdom for me?",

            "comment": "I would recommend living in the dorms (central campus) your freshman year. It\u2019s easier to meet other freshmen and make friends that way, and frankly the pros outweigh the cons I think. Getting to class is more convenient, getting to the dining hall is more convenient, and the internet isn\u2019t much different from what you get at West Campus. Having the gym nearby is nice, but you\u2019re better off relying on the shuttle to get to the gym than relying on it to get to class. ",

However, in my experience west campus has less going on than the dorms. If you are a freshman trying to make friends, I suggest dorm life.\n\nHowever, if you do not have a vehicle you will be taking to GCSU or money is a concern choose the dorms. Cheaper and more convient. ",

    "postText": "Hello, all. I was wondering if anyone who currently attends (or has attended) GCSU can tell me a bit more about their nursing program. I'm particularly interested in their graduate MSN programs (NP school/concentrations). I'm looking to apply for NP school and have already applied here, as well as a couple other schools like GSU and UAB. I actually just had my interview this past week for their program. Would anyone be able to tell me more about their program, as well as what their experiences are/were like at this school? I'm looking forward to learning more and hearing from others! Thanks.",

I know the program works in cohorts that you have to apply for. You follow this cohort from start to finish by taking almost all of the same classes together as a group.",

It saved me a lot of time and money and stress of having to be put in the position of not being able to find preceptors. That\u2019s probably one of the most unfortunate things with NP programs. Not all these schools help students secure clinical sites and preceptors. It\u2019s challenging for sure! Has the school been of any help, in your opinion? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the school is great and I\u2019m sure they have good intentions, but how far is that going to get all of us across the finish line? We need to all have clinicals and preceptors secured. People shouldn\u2019t be getting delayed or falling behind because the school can\u2019t assist with finding placement. I wish sometimes they just did the NP rotations the same way they did BSN rotations. Assigning multiple students to one site in groups, or rotating students through a site or NP preceptor.",

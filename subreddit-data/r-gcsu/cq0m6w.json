I would call housing to check and see what the official guidelines are. There are events going on and you'll need to sign paperwork to get your room, and I'm not sure what their rules are. Also, Cat Crew volunteers will be out there from those times to help you move in. They are a HUGE help and I would recommend moving in Thursday if you can.",

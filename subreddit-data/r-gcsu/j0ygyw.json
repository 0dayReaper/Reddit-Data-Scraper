I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve already taken 1301 if you\u2019re asking this (if not, I think it\u2019s a prerequisite so take that one first).\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I was in the class, but I believe they cover topics that have a much greater focus on object oriented programming, a little bit of topics on interfacing with hardware, and a little bit of topics on software development. It\u2019s pretty much the prerequisite for all the upper levels, and so this is one of the classes meant to weed out people not serious about going into CS. I\u2019m not saying that to scare you in any way though, because like I said it\u2019s not terribly difficult if it\u2019s what you want to commit yourself to.\n\nWhen I was in the course, they only taught Java; however, the students I tutored told me that they offer a hybrid between Java and python where they switch off between the two.\n\nThat being said, I think the professors are Either Dr. Phelps or Mr. Richardson.\n\nEDIT: If you have any other questions, feel free to DM me with them! I\u2019m more than happy to help.",

Renting a house is the smartest thing to do financially but break-ins happen. I lived at The Bellamy for two and a half years. In hindsight I probably should've gone with The Grove but I liked the aesthetic of The Bellamy.",

Not a terrible place, but there are better options around town. 2 years ago, pipes froze and then burst on the third floor of one of the buildings and flooded several apartments below them. The pool is nice though.\n\nThats all I've got.",

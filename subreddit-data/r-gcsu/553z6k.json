I've been really interested in going and doing some exploring around there, but when I go, I always seem to go with people that are scared to death of the place and don't want to do anything risky.  \n\nIs there a good way in?

They are very strict and not afraid to prosecute students for trespassing. Plus, it actually is kinda dangerous with the condition of some of the buildings. ",

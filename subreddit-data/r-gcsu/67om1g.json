Being an education major, most of my connections consist of me going out to schools and meeting teachers and asking around for anything I might could help with. My current internship (at a high school about 40 minutes out) has taught me the value of being active and known in your respective areas. Get to know the masters of your craft and learn from them. Actively work with them before entering your career.\n\nThis kind of goes into the timing of it. As I said, don't wait. It's never too early to make those connections both before and during your internship. You can't know enough people.\n\nIn terms of importance, it's super important to have an internship. Whether it's paid or not, it's really beneficial to be working yourself to the best of your ability. Sitting back and waiting on something or, even worse, not looking to inform yourself of your career choice(s) only leads to frustration when you enter the job market with little to no experience or knowledge of how to execute. You have to get your feet wet.\n\nI've loved every minute of my student teaching internship, it's been really eye opening and suggest everyone to be involved and dedicated to their own interests to apply and learn as much as possible from their own internship.

I never considered myself a frat person, but found a lot of support and reality in the one I joined, and it became my second home. \n\nWorst moment would have to be the Spring of 2016, when I decided to rush through a brand new degree and run myself into the ground with a crazy amount of classes. I also had a very toxic relationship going on at that time, so it was a rough time for me. Pacing is critical so you don't burn yourself out.\n\nMost unforgettable is any time I went downtown besides Buff's. That's my place, no other late night crowd works best for me. Except Metropolis, the people there are amazing.",

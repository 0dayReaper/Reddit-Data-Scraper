    "postText": "Hey, might be a stupid and sort of fear-mongering question, but I was heavily thinking of attending GCSU in 2021 so I've been reading a lot about Milledgeville and accidentally stumbled across some spooky numbers that make it seem like the crime rate is pretty high? Wondering if anyone here has any experience with crime around where the campus is located, or if the crime is more farther away in other parts of the city. How common is crime in the area of Milledgeville where GCSU is located? Specifically seems to be a lot of theft and burglaries more than anything else.",

            "comment": "Crime is probably about the same as any other town of about 18,000 people. Generally the neighborhoods get worse the further south from downtown you get, but most college students live around downtown or a little ways north or west. If you\u2019re a freshman you\u2019ll probably be in the dorms, which are downtown. Just use common sense like keeping your car locked and you should be fine. I\u2019ve lived in Milledgeville most of my life and I\u2019ve never had any crime issues.",

This is especially true for nights when people go to the bars and such.\n\nIf you bring a bike, make sure to lock it up. I know someone that left theirs on their front lawn and it \"disappeared\". Make sure you lock your car too.\n\nOtherwise, I'd say it's an okay town. You're never going to be fully away from crime anywhere, so it's important to to just stay aware of what's going on around you. Quite a few major crimes have happened near or on the campus during my several years here with most of them being at night, but I wouldn't say they are exceedingly common. Having seen multiple accidents around town, I'd say the most dangerous thing in town to look out for is traffic/cars.",

The time something was stolen was when someone left a hefty amount of cash in plain view in their car over night. I\u2019d be more worried about getting your drink spiked, happened to a few girls I know",

The computers in the library are the same, they are putting an electronics store right behind the coffee shop on the ground floor, the study cube desks on the 3rd floor are gone and they put the desks from the 1st floor there, other than that  the library is the same. They put new furniture in a&amp;s, funky nice couches and chairs. The old building across from front campus was renovated and is an  administration building. They are going to start renovating Atkinson, beeson, and parks for more classrooms this summer. Other than that there is nothing new.",

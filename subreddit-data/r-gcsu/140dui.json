    "postText": "Hey guys, I know this is a fairly small subreddit, but figured I'd get word out everywhere I could. My name is Kenny Humphries, I'm an active redditor, and also a fairly active member of the Art Dept here at GC. Hopefully you all saw this [fine piece of art](http://i.imgur.com/48UBi.jpg) hanging up at Mayfair Hall this past week. I had 2 banners up in promotion of my Senior Thesis show opening up on Monday the 3rd. This morning, my work was gone. About 40 hours of work went into it's creation, and I see no use for someone to have a 9' tall version of my face. While flattering, it's also downright upsetting. If anyone sees this work, in a dorm, at a party, waving from the back of a truck, let me know. I need this back for my show, as well as my portfolio. It can be returned to Blackbridge Hall in the next 2 days, no questions asked. I don't want anyone to fry for this, I just want my art back. Find Kennyface, and come see my show, Dec 3, Blackbridge Hall. I love you all. ",

Detective Miller checked the security cameras that are all over campus, apparently there are 3 on the front of Mayfair, and collected faces from the footage. From there he found there names, and their on campus address, and went and talked to them about. The banner was returned to Blackbridge Hall to Bill Fisher (Dept. Chair) by Detective Miller, and it's all in the school's hands now.",

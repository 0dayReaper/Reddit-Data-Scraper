The plates are artificially thicker than the previous plates so the maximum amount of weight you can put on a bar is less than before. \n\nThe benches for the bench press are too thin, which makes it more difficult to stabilize. Plus they have a break in the bench right where your shoulders should be and that point is incredibly important for anyone who benches with proper form. \n\nThey don't have a proper dip station yet and have yet to bring over a weight belt. So I've gone a whole two weeks without doing a proper weighted dip or pull-up. \n\nSo yeah, basically my impression is that this gym is a 28 million dollar waste of space and a massive downgrade from the depot which was literally a 5 minute walk from where I lived.\n\nOh yeah, its pretty for whatever that counts.",

One's shoulders should not sink into the bench.\n",

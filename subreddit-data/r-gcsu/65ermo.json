So far we have added a new CSS (work in progress) and /u/TheShoveler created a GCSU bot to post Frontpage updates. We are also working on updating the rules page to reflect the 3 Rs of GCSU, reason, respect, and responsibility and expanding the side bar with more information and FAQs. \n\nWe are continually looking for ways to spruce this place up, however! **If you have any suggestions for how we can continue to update and improve the place please let us know in the comments or message one of the moderators.** (We all know each other pretty well so word will get around.)",

When the attitudes, actions, and ideas of a small number of bigoted individuals make that less possible for some members of our community, everyone suffers. As a person of conscience, I believe it is my obligation to counter that speech with more speech, speech which asserts my belief in the absolute value of every member of our community and their right to reject images associated with this campus that are dehumanizing, derogatory, degrading and unfunny. Furthermore, as a member of the Milledgeville/Baldwin County community, I believe this campus belongs to each member of this community and that as college students, we have an obligation to create a welcoming environment for all members, including young children who might be visitors here but who, as members of families who pay taxes, have just as much right to this campus as I do. I reject the attitudes, values, and beliefs expressed by some members of this community and assert instead a positive, affirming, and joyful engagement with my fellow students and citizens.\n\n\nSomeone takes the internet a little too seriously...",

    "postText": "Hey, so I recently took and passed the GA History exemption exam and I thought I\u2019d share some tips in case anyone else was planning on taking it at some point :)\n\nFirst of all, this exam is quite difficult. I took the GA and US constitution exams as well(I was exempt from taking the US History exam because of my APUSH score) and this exam was easily the most difficult out of the three. I also didn\u2019t pass the GA History exam the first time either. If you end up having to retake the exam too, you should know that there is a different version each time. Some questions remained the same both times, but overall the two exams were quite different.\n\nIn order to study, I would recommend looking over this Quizlet(https://quizlet.com/606532187/misa-proof-usg-georgia-history-legislative-requirement-exam-flash-cards/?x=1jqU&amp;i=en5kl) and reading over the History overview section on the GA Encyclopedia site. I really studied those while preparing for my second attempt and they helped a lot.\n\nWhen looking over the GA encyclopedia page, I would really recommend clicking on any links they mention and skimming over the articles  they bring you to. The overview page doesn\u2019t always go into detail about some of the places or people it mentions, so clicking on the links within the page can give you more information. Most of the questions require you to know certain details about an event, place, or person, so clicking on the links that the overview page mentioned was really helpful for me.\n\nKnowing historical figures is really important. Most of the questions I had on both versions were about specific historical figures. The Quizlet I linked and the GA Encyclopedia overview page will mention most of the important historical figures you\u2019ll need to know. Make sure you know what they did and knowing details such as the decade they were most active in is important too.\n\nA few questions require you to know more than one name or to know a certain order of events. If you know at least one of the names for the answer or if you know at least the first and last event for a certain question, that can help you eliminate a couple wrong answers or even find the right one.\n\nRead the questions carefully. Some of them are in longer paragraph form and they have some context clues that can help lead you to the right answer.\n\nRemember that you only need to get 30/50 questions right to pass. Since you only have an hour, I would recommend answering all the questions you\u2019re confident about before worrying about the rest.\n\n And finally, good luck :) The exam is hard ngl, but if you take the time to study- it is possible to pass.\n\nEdit: An additional tip is that(as of now at least), you won\u2019t be able to look back on your test to see what you missed after you submit it. I would suggest paying attention to any unfamiliar concepts on the test and take note of them, because you may be able to study some of those concepts again later if you have to retake the exam for whatever reason. Not all of the questions will be the same ofc, but on both of my exams- there were times when I had the same sort of questions on both versions.",

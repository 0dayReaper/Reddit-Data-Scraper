There was a bunch of different stations from pizza, burgers &amp; fries, southern type comfort food like fried chicken or pork chops, salad bar, hibachi, sandwiches, a vegetarian or maybe vegan spot &amp; ice cream every day. My friends would use one of their friend swipe that came with their meal plan &amp; I\u2019d eat a little bit of everything. If you don\u2019t have a swipe it\u2019s like $13 or something like that",

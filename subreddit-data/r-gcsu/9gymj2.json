I'm not sure if you guys have a gaming/esports org that someone can point me towards? I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll link the college COD discord just in case anyone who reads this would like to join and help create the team! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://discord.gg/feBPsHd](https://discord.gg/feBPsHd) ",

Feel free to [email](mailto:GCLeageoflegends@gmail.com) them if you want to get in contact with them. Or visit their [twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/georgiacollegeesports) too.",

Let them know you're coming, and be accommodating without being run over. You're the new guy but not the fall guy. I guess they've been there since the first of the school year? Ask what you can bring, maybe their old roommate left with the microwave or all the dishes. The key with roommates is patience and flexibility. You may have never lived so close to so many people before, and chances are they haven't either. Everyone just wants a little space every now and then, and if they don't get it they go a little crazy and lash out on people they normally like. Try to figure out if your roommate is a morning person or a night owl. I had a roommate that went to sleep early so I stayed up late reading or redditing to get some semblance of alone time. \n Also, temperature has split more roommate situations than any other reason in my experience. Don't change the thermostat without talking with everyone about their preferences first. You may need to wear a sweatshirt inside sometimes to keep the peace. \nAlso, try to contain the mess. With four people to a suite, there will be dishes and laundry and more dishes. A dirty bowl sitting in the sink for three days only builds tension, wash it. \nAnd one last thing. Your roommates do not have to be your best friends forever. It's actually better if they're not. A friendly roommate who you can talk to about room related issues without letting your friendship get in the way is better than a friend you don't want to offend.\n\nI think that's everything, sorry about the wall of text. Just remember, college is awesome but it doesn't have to be \"the time of your life\" like most people say. Yeah it's great but don't put so much pressure on yourself to make it the perfect experience. \n",

    "postText": "I am an alumna (Class of 2009), and I'd like to bring my SO down for a short stay (&lt;48 hours) just so he can see where I spent a few years of my life, and we can have a mini-getaway for one evening. I'd like to know if these places I enjoyed in my college years are still there: The Brick, Buffingtons, Blackbird Coffee (do they still have Improv and Acoustics nights - are they are any good?), Kuroshima (or was it called Kuroshika?), and a little Mediterranean joint that was also downtown (I've forgotten the name).\n\nAre there other new editions to downtown that would be neat to check out? We used to have a beautiful candy/ice cream store downtown but it closed while I was a student. I also remember an old comic books/games shop next to the army store, too, but I don't remember the name of it or the owner's name, either.\n\nI remember Antebellum Inn was only a few blocks away and you could walk by some of the pretty houses and campus on the way to downtown. Are there other options available these days?\n\nWe might go check out whatever is going on at Russell Auditorium because I used to like to go see plays and Jazz Band concerts there, too.",

            "comment": "All those restaurants are still there, in addition to the comic shop. There are also a few new places that have opened up downtown, like Jimmy John's, Smoothie King, an ice cream place, a frozen yogurt place, a breakfast/brunch restaurant, a Jamaican place, and a few others.\n\nPuebla's is no longer downtown, but the owner bought the Mexican restaurant at the mall and reopened it as Puebla's. Asian Bistro is also closed, as well as Capital City and Chops due to an ongoing drug trafficking and money laundering investigation. The big three-story building across from Buffington's has been renovated and turned into loft apartments.\n\nThe college bookstore is now run by Barnes &amp; Noble and occupies part of the old Campus Theatre, which has been restored for use by the theatre department. The old PawPrints bookstore building is now used by the music department as a new band room.",

When I was there, the three story building (I think it was a Belk's a looong time ago) was an antique store, and they were thinking about making it into a hotel.\n\nI don't really care to visit the chain restaurants while I'm visiting Milledgeville, but that's awesome that those things are available to the local and GCSU community now.\n\nIs there still a university bookstore on campus next to the Einstein Bros or are things like gifts just in the old Campus Theatre/Barnes &amp; Noble now? I'm asking in case I'd like to pick up a t-shirt or something while I'm down there.",

The ground floor houses the brunch restaurant Local Yolkal and the frozen yogurt shop Chilly Milly.\n\nJimmy John's and Smoothie King are the first chains to open downtown in a really long time, with the exception of a short-lived Quiznos a few years ago. The other new places are locally owned. Make sure you look around in case I've forgotten anything.\n\nThe bottom level of MSU has been renovated, and Einstein Bros is still there, but in a larger space. All the books, gifts, and apparel have been centralized in the Campus Theatre bookstore.",

Then for lunch go to the mexican restaurant practically next door, Gringos, to get the shrimp lime tacos and a marg. To cool off, walk across the street to Sweet Treats for dessert where you can't go wrong on any flavor. And end the day with dinner at Georgia Bob's BBQ with a pick 2 meal pulled pork and chicken salad(pro tip: ask for a sample of pimento cheese and put a small spread of it on half a piece of bread, put some of the chicken salad on it, fold hotdog style, and just enjoy) with sides of sweet potato tots and brunswick stew but before you leave give Jeff and/or Drew a quick shoutout for me.",

It's above what became a Verizon store (across from amici. The building that was vacant for literally forever.). It is adorable and super convenient to all the things you listed. You can rent it on airbnb for cheaper than on the hotel site. But it isn't super cheap. I went down before thanksgiving and stayed there for a weekend and would 10/10 do it again. Enjoy!! \n\n[soho lofts milledgeville](http://m.soholoftsga.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoholoftsga.com%2F&amp;utm_referrer=#2818) \n\nEdit to include the most important thing: the brick changed its menu a little and it's not as good anymore. I was basically devastated when I couldn't get my brick oven cheesy bread.  ",

This is great news because that kind of hotel would be more my SO's style than the original Antebellum Inn's B&amp;B set-up. I've stayed at Antebellum Inn before, so I don't mind staying somewhere else he'd like better.\n\nThank you!",

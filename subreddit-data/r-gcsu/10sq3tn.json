But now I\u2019m being called for a second interview soon because \"We are unsure if bps is the right fit for you\u201d. I thought I left a good impression. \nSo my question is: is this I sign I did bad. Or did I not give enough in my initial interview.",

            "comment": "That is a little weird for them to call you into a second interview. I\u2019m class of 2023 and I interviewed for BSP and got an acceptance 5 days after. The same thing with my friend. I think it\u2019s kinda rare they do that to people, but for next time, make sure you just have a good impression. They really liked when I showed them interest in their clubs and other social activities. Try to tell stories that show you as a person rather than talk about academics. Talk about social things you did in high school too, such as sports, clubs, leadership, etc. When I went they asked me the reason I would want to join BSP. Just say it\u2019s going to prepare you for better grades once actual college starts. That\u2019s what I said and they liked it. I have another friend interviewing so I\u2019ll see if it happens to him. Hope this helps",

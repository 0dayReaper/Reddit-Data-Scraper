It was called unorganized, the name playing on not being biased to an organized religion, but we accepted everyone and we alloted ourselves an hour a week to talk about a topic. It was a great group, but since I've been at gcsu it has dwindled and I think no one meets anymore :(. There is a group that tries to accept all religions because of the mass majority of Christianity at our school, it's called Inter-Views Alliance [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=26905433936). There's also Philosophy Club which is about as close as you can get to an atheist group already on campus . . . but I'm in full support of one directed only for atheists. I was just letting you know of some groups already on campus!\n\nquick ninja edit: besides weird looks you should meet little resistance in starting this group.",

            "comment": "Any and every group on campus, that is not created by the school itself, is likely to only be as good as the person who runs it. Interest for almost anything will exist, but being a small school, most narrow or very defined interests will be small too. As for resistance, you'll only receive resistance if you're a total dooshe about things. Unorganized worked for the time it was around because people actually were learned and had intellectual conversations rather than being a live version of /r/atheism.\n ",

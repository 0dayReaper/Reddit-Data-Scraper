    "postText": "Hi everyone! \nGcsu has their own gender based club.  Our club's focus is to provide a safe haven and resource for those who don't identify as cisgender.  We have powerpoints dedicated to different gender identities and occasionally play videos from documentaries,  shows,  movies,  etc..   That are in relationship to gender.  We are a sub group of the Pride Alliance on campus.  We can be found on Facebook (gender Revolutionists at georgia college).  Everyone is welcome to join. You're free to post here with questions or inbox me! ",

    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The safety of our students is a top priority for Georgia College.  Therefore, we are asking all students to depart campus by the end of the day on Friday, March 13, 2020 and to remain away from campus until  March 29, 2020. At this time, students are not being asked to move out  of their residence halls for the remainder of the semester. Georgia College will accommodate students who are unable to leave campus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While students are away from campus, Georgia College faculty and staff will be finalizing online instruction modules and business continuity plans. State officials will continue to assess the current  situation regarding coronavirus (COVID-19) in Georgia.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Please check our [website](https://www.gcsu.edu/coronavirus) for the latest information as well as the [USG\u2019s website](https://www.usg.edu/%20coronavirus). Additional information will be posted as this situation continues to unfold.\n\nSauce: [https://frontpage.gcsu.edu/announcement/campus-updates-coronavirus](https://frontpage.gcsu.edu/announcement/campus-updates-coronavirus)",

Her grading seems like it has set guidelines but it\u2019s also arbitrary sometimes. I did a lab with 4 graphs and 3 data tables plus 8 review questions once. I got one review question wrong and she gave me a 60 on the whole thing. I know that\u2019s a long answer but honestly I just needed to get that frustration out.",

    "postText": "I'm looking into mostly liberal arts colleges to attend as a Junior. I'm really interested in History and would even get involved with it for a career. Is Carelton a good place to study history until I go for my Master's degree somewhere else?\n\nWhat kind of GPA is good to have in order to have a chance to get in? I have a 3.8 unweighted, but I know extracurriculars play a big part in admissions. \n\nWhat's living at Carleton like?\n\nSorry for a big wall of text, but I want alot of these questions answered. \n\nEdit: Junior in High School to clarify\n\nAlso, if anyone is open to me PMing them about admissions and stuff, I would appreciate it :)",

As far as living at Carleton goes, the biggest change for me coming from high school was that all of the people who dont want to be in school arent here. There isnt really anyone that I would consider an idiot. Its surprisingly nice not to have to explain some weird reference or strange concept. Most of the time people just get it.",

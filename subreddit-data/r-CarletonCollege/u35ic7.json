You will have the chance to do so much. \n\nThere's an academic resource fair where many departments will be (so no need to email professors or anything). \n\nFun in Northfield? It's a beautiful town so just walk around. There might be some construction. I like tandem bagels so I always go there. \n\nIt's not slated to snow tomorrow (*knock on wood*) but it'll be chilly. Make sure to have a beanie\n\nYou can see the schedule for ASE on their [website](https://www.carleton.edu/admissions/visit/ase/) or [direct link](https://carleton-wp-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/ASE-Schedule_FINAL_4.15.22.pdf)",

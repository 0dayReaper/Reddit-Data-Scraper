    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nProspective student here. When describing Carleton academics, students often say \"rigorous.\" While I do enjoy being challenged, I aim to attend a top 14 law school post-graduare, and having a top notch GPA is requisite. \n\nI plan on majoring in political science and taking many courses within the humanities and social sciences. Since many classes are discussion based, what is the homework like? Lots of reading? Essay writing? Examinations? \n\nIn my high school, the most rewarding classes were the ones that were challenging and required consistent effort to get an A. The ones I abhorred, were the ones where I put in my best effort and my grade outcome does not reflect it. I know GPA is a deeply flawed measure of academic performance and do wish it was less important, but it is critical in grad school admissions. \n\nIs grade deflation a problem? Are most Carleton classes like the course I described, as in you can get an A if you put in the effort? \n\nAppreciate your thoughts on this.",

            "comment": "You can definitely get an A if you put in the work. I can only think of one prof who's that stereotypical \"I only give one A per class\" (ironically that's a con law prof). Even still, the Carleton name holds a lot of weight in the graduate scene as a school that produces excellent students (because we are already used to rigorous academics). \n\nAs to what classes are like, it depends. Even at Carleton, there are those \"easy\" classes. Most are a lot of reading. And the ones that are very heavy in writings will say \"Writing Rich\" when signing up for them.",

            "comment": "Most of the discussion based classes I had were very heavy on the reading material (what else are you going to discuss) as far as homework, with occasional papers and tests. Research strategies that work for you when it comes to comprehension.\n\n100 levels were easy A\u2019s, 300 levels not so much. I\u2019d recommend making sure to work with your advisor if you\u2019re concerned. Carleton is really fantastic when it comes to faculty-student relations and using that to your advantage will only make life easier. \n\nCarleton has good matriculation into law schools, even for non poli-sci majors \u2014 I really wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. My best friend went to  UCLA from a cognitive science/neuroscience major.",

Carlton has an excellent reputation among grad schools, which results in very high acceptance rates for Carleton grads, even if the challenging courses might not always result in perfect GPAs.\n\nBasically they would prefer to teach students who have proven they can hack it in Carleton level courses \u2014 even if there are a smattering of Bs or (gasp) Cs on the transcript \u2014 than those who coasted to an easy A at a less rigorous school.",

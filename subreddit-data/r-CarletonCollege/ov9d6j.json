    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming Freshman. I want to study Italian to better communicate with the Italian-speakers in my family. Is there a way I can do this at Carleton? I know Carleton doesn't have an Italian program, but maybe through independent study? I emailed a few different people who Carleton's website said should be in charge of this sort of thing, but I haven't got any responses (reasonably so, it is summer, after all). I'm curious if anyone on this subreddit knows anything about this.",

You can start a new student org and get it funded so you and others could study Italian, and you could do a study abroad to Italy, but other than that I\u2019m not aware of much. Of course, in your free time you would be able to study whatever you want, but Carleton doesn\u2019t have many Italian resources from what I know",

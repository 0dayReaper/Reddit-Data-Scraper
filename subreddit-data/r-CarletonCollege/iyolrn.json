            "comment": "Honestly hard to say; not many people do it. A big factor is that after spending 3 years at Carleton, the relationships you build and the friends you make, you kinda want to ride it out for that last year with them. It's tough to leave junior year,especially not walking the stage with the class that you entered with. \n\nI know that's probably not the advice you were searching for but it's what I was told when I considered it (though, I didn't consider it too strongly, to be honest). Let me know if you got more questions!",

            "comment": "3-2 is sorta pointless because like u/NotACarletonRep said, you've already made friends you don't want to leave, plus at that point you're getting two Bachelors degrees. Might as well just do the 4-2 and get the MS at WashU. It's basically guaranteed admission as long as you've got decent grades. I spoke with Prof. Marty Baylor about it last year, and though she will try to actively discourage you from doing it, she did throw in that Carleton has *never* had someone not get accepted to the program. Which btw is Physics prof for \"You can do better than WashU for grad school\"",

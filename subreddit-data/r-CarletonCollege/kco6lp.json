    "postText": "Hi everyone my sister received a scholarship from Carleton, we\u2019re from houston to so this is a far departure for her but we\u2019re excited. I had a couple of questions for some current students or alumni\u2018s.\n\n1. I read that no vehicles we\u2019re allowed, since she\u2019s moving so far I was hoping she could keep a little car errands and emergencies.\n2. She\u2019s graduating high school with an associates degree so would she considered a first year student?\n3. I guess this goes with the earlier question but with housing can she request a private room or get one.\n4. How is the campus life? I\u2019m her brother and I went to college here in tx and enjoyed it I\u2019m a little excited for her to experience it but I\u2019m nervous that\u2019s she\u2019s going so far so I wanted to know.\n\nAnd thanks to anyone who replies!",

There was a program for hourly rentals of cars for general use that was pretty reasonable iirc. You can apply for a parking permit and I feel like there were different tiers based on the reason you had the car. \n\n2. Carleton does not accept credits from very many other colleges, and AP course credits were dodgy too. So that associate\u2019s is probably not going to apply. Obviously it would be a case by case basis but as a general rule, it\u2019s a 4 year school. I knew a couple people who did it in 3 and they had to apply to graduate early and pretty much all they did was homework, no extra curriculars. Admissions office could give you specific info for this. \n\n3. There are VERY few singles on campus and campus housing is required. If there was a medical reason she needed a single I\u2019m sure they can do something but otherwise there will be roommates. Making friends is hard enough not sure why you wouldn\u2019t want some company?? \n\n4. This is a little too general, but there\u2019s activities most nights and clubs and a shitload of homework to do \u2014 library is always bumpin.",

So I was wondering if y\u2019all had something like that. \nI was hoping that Carleton would accept her degree because she worked so hard and this was the end goal for her.",

            "comment": "Hey! Happy to hear she\u2019s considering Carleton! \n\n1) No first years cannot have a car on campus. However we have a taxi service and a shuttle as well as typically (not this year because COVID) a car rental company. So she will be able to get around for errands for sure.\n2) She will be considered a first year. Only a max of about 30 credits (or 5 classes) could be accepted pre-matriculation, and those usually aren\u2019t for associate\u2019s degrees. People who come into Carleton take four years to leave, probably about 95% of the time. And those who don\u2019t, it takes them a term or two longer, rarely a full year, and very rarely taking only 3 years to graduate, as that\u2019s just not the structure. \n3) Unless she has a documented disability where she requires a private room, she will be placed in a room with one or two roommates her freshman year. You won\u2019t be able to get around it, and it\u2019s generally a great match most of the time and even when not it goes well. Also with this, dorms do not have private bathrooms (except for upper classmen-heavy dorms) so don\u2019t expect that either.\n4) Campus life is great! We actually have a lot of people from Houston every year thanks to Posse, which also provides a great community for them. People are super nice and genuine here, and it\u2019s been a great time. It of course varies by person whether you love it or not, but I definitely do. There\u2019s a big emphasis on community here too.\n\nAlso good to note is only about 1/3 of the class (probably close to 1/5) of each year is from MN, Carleton is a very out of state-heavy school. I and most of my friends are not from MN, so she shouldn\u2019t feel weird at all about being out of state, as most of us are (or even not from the US)!",

And the car thing is mainly because we have very limited parking (think maybe 300 spots and 2000 students) and you really really don\u2019t need a car since it\u2019s a small town. For reference, I go into town about twice a week for medical appointments and do not have a car. Also that rule is only for first years. She can apply to get a parking permit starting her sophomore year",

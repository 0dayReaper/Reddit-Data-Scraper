            "comment": "The new registration system (in theory) exists in order to take the stress out of registration by moving it weeks before traditional registration. You send in your priority/preference rankings for each class and relieve your assigned class in advance using a matching algorithm. I honestly prefer it to traditional registration because there's no need for a last minute scramble if one of your classes fills up right before your registration period begins. Lowkey hoping The Match expands to the other majors in the future, it would make registration much simpler IMO.\n\nTLDR: The Match doesn't make it any harder to register for CS courses in my experience.\n\nThe department isn't understaffed per say, but it has one of the highest average class sizes simply because there are so many CS majors. If they staffed the courses to meet the same class sizes as other less popular majors, there wouldn't be any professors left over for the non CS majors lmao.\n\nThe class size hasn't felt like a detriment to my learning though, since all professors have office hours and most are very receptive to out-of-class questions. Usually they lecture or do group work in class, and one on one stuff either happens as the professor walks around, or during office hours.\n\nHope this helps",

            "comment": "No, it is not \"understaffed\".  It's just that people are beginning to forget that this is a liberal arts college. :-) \\[\\*\\]\n\nThere was a time not all that long ago when the most popular majors at Carleton were English, History, Biology, Soc/Anthro and Poli Sci.  Computer Science wasn't even offered as a major until around 1987.  The decision to elevate CS from a concentration (a \"concentration\" was sort-of analogous to what we now call a \"minor\") to a major was quite controversial at the time.\n\nToday, CS is by far the most popular major.  Not only is there a high demand for CS classes, but there's also a high demand for certain classes within the department.  The new system helps spread out the demand over the full array of CS classes.\n\nThe new system makes it so that you probably won't be able to take **all** the classes you want, but it does maximize the chance that everybody will get at least **some** of the classes they want.\n\nJust think of it like a distro requirement within a distro requirement.  The college's distribution requirements prevent everyone from taking nothing but English poetry classes for four years.  Carleton's distribution requirements make students spread out and take courses in math, physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, philosophy, history, multicultural studies, gender studies, music, art, foreign languages, etc.\n\nArticle on the new registration system:\n\n[https://www.thecarletonian.com/2021/02/13/cs-department-see-eventful-year-with-expansion-to-olin-new-registration-system/](https://www.thecarletonian.com/2021/02/13/cs-department-see-eventful-year-with-expansion-to-olin-new-registration-system/)\n\n\\[\\*\\] \"A liberal arts education values **how you come** to learn more than necessarily **what** you learn\":\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-rd69yZw\\_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-rd69yZw_w)",

    "postText": "Is the policy for deferral at Carleton College in the same vein as Stanford deferrals, where there is still a reasonable chance of admission in the RD round because if you were not in contention at all they would've straight up rejected you, or is it more in the vein of MIT, where nearly every applicant not accepted in ED/EA gets deferred and a deferral is essentially letting the student down easy.\n\nI recognize that Carleton is a LAC which neither Stanford nor MIT are, as well as that I should not expect acceptance in RD no matter what the deferral policy is, but I am trying to determine what my odds realistically look like at this point.",

Best of luck!",

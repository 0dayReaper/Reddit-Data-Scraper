In light of how radically the pandemic has changed plans for people graduating college this year, we wanted to make a video focusing on the issue for our YouTube series, Tomorrow Together ([https://bit.ly/2xEpCgI](https://bit.ly/2xEpCgI)). We'd love to hear how you've adjusted or what you're doing instead of canceled internships, study abroad programs, etc., and how all the chaos is affecting you.\n\nUse this form to share your story with us, if you're interested: [https://bit.ly/2zg93Z8](https://bit.ly/2zg93Z8). We may contact you to set up a short video chat that would be recorded for the show.\n\nThanks, all! I hope everyone is doing okay. \u2014Alexis",

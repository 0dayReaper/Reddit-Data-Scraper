    "postText": "Hey all! I'm applying to Carleton this autumn, and I'm pretty convinced, but I'm still a little nervous about committing to Early Decision. I'm trying to get all of my questions out of the way, so if I could get some responses from Carleton students, that would be great!\n\nReally what I want to know is what the social climate at Carleton is like. When I visited campus, the tour guide told us about the football team having a Discord server to play D&amp;D together, and I really really liked that. I definitely fit the Carleton standard of a 'quirky' kid, but I'm worried about applying to a college where people won't really accept me. In short, at the risk of sounding like a moron, I'm worried that I might be a little *too* quirky.\n\nSo I kind of just wanted to know what people on campus are like with their interests and social acceptance! What kind of music do people like? What are people's favorite movies, shows? Is it accepting of people who might be different due to mental disorders (I personally have ADHD)? I just want to make sure I'm going to the right place :\\] Thanks so much in advance!",

There are so many communities Carls are part of, from the Office of Accessibility Resources to our acapella groups. People here care a lot about each other. And we also love hearing about other people and what they love. I\u2019m some who hates sports and any physical activity, doesn\u2019t listen to music, doesnt binge watch TV, loves to cook, can talk for way too long about my classes, and more and I have multiple friends who love me and a campus who accepts me. I can\u2019t speak highly enough about Carleton. I think as someone who thinks they\u2019ll love Carleton, you are already perfect for here. ED is very nerve wracking for sure, but I\u2019d say you\u2019ve got this! You can also DM me too",

The people I knew who struggled finding friendships were people who were very arrogant (usually the super rich kids) and people who weren\u2019t willing to adjust to the wider worldview you get from college (social justice, climate activism, etc). It\u2019s an extremely lgbtq+ friendly campus, and rather left leaning. In general, most everyone liked being active, usually had a couple nerdy passions, and enjoyed learning. There are a TON of student groups and I would recommend researching those a bit \u2014 if there\u2019s a couple you\u2019re interested in, you\u2019re good to go.",

The school gives you so many ways to make friends through new student week groups, dorm activities, and clubs! As long as your not an asshole, it\u2019s easy to make friends spontaneously in class or in dining halls (in my short experience).",

            "comment": "Carleton students don't take themselves too seriously. I know, I know... qUiRkY cArLs that's what admissions always tells you but I honestly believe it. Students are just living their best lives. My friends and I last year were super into trying to draw the map of the usa from memory. We love to sled and roll down the hill behind Evans dorm. We are goofy and accepting of everyone and what sort of things they come to school with. \n\nIt's not like highschool were people care about what other people are doing in a bad way. It's more that people are excited if you have this passion. Carleton is a place where I do think there are students with mental health problem but not like more so than any other school. I more mean that students are happy. They want to be there and they like each other and they care about each other.",

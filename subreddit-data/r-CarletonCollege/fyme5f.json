    "postText": "Decision day is steadily approaching, and I was wondering if anybody found themselves in a similar situation as me. I've narrowed down my options to Carleton and the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I really love both schools. I applied to Carleton thinking \"well even if I got in, I'd never be able to afford it\" with a small part of me hoping for some financial aid... then they gave me a financial aid package that made going there cheaper than going to the UMNTC annually, leaving me utterly confused. I've been taking PSEO classes at the UMN for the past two years and I know what the UMN is like. I also love the CS department at the UMN, but I have little experience with the CS program at Carleton. I don't really know anyone who goes to Carleton, and I just want some honest answers from real students. **If you were accepted into Carleton and the University of Twin Cities, what made you choose Carleton?** I'd love to know some pros and cons! If you're a CS major, I'd love to also hear about the CS department and your experiences too!",

I'm also, like, old.\n\nI was a CS major a number of years ago at Carleton now, but I'd like to point out something. You seem to be debating the pros and cons of the CS program specifically. While that's a worthwhile exercise, I think you should consider the bigger picture.\n\nUMN is gigantic compared to Carleton. Your personal happiness is going to revolve significantly around that difference. That is what I'd be focusing on, personally. Do you want to walk around between classes and see people you recognize? Or do you like the idea of the opportunity to meet new people all the time? Do you need to always have stuff to do within a walk, or a short drive? Also consider things like average class size. I had a number of classes where there were 6 or fewer students. One class where we met in the professor's office each period.\n\nI know you didn't ask that question per se, but hopefully a different perspective would be helpful.",

I have taken classes at the UMN and do understand how difficult it can be to learn in huge lecture halls. I just wanted to see some other people\u2019s perspectives to see what points would be brought up. I was specifically focusing on CS because I don\u2019t really know much about Carleton program, but really enjoy the UMN\u2019s CS classes I\u2019ve taken and wanted some insider\u2019s insight.",

            "comment": "Hey /u/Witty-Wombat,\n\nI relate to your post a lot. I was practically in the same situation you were in four years ago. I'm now a senior CS and math major at Carleton.\n\nLike you, I was a PSEO student at the UMN for two years. I took an intro CS class during my junior year and loved it. During the application process, I knew I wanted to go to the U and graduate early with my PSEO credits because I knew I wasn't getting into Carleton knowing their acceptance rate. To my surprise, I was accepted into Carleton and the financial aid package was substantially better than what the U provided. Only after that I consider coming here and I am glad I did.\n\nEnough with the background though, you just want to know what factors played into my decision.\n\n**Not Being Another Number/Individual Attention**\n\nOne unavoidable feature is school size. At the U, I personally felt that I was just another \"number\" to the school and not an actual student. Classes were enormously large and it is easy to disappear in a large lecture hall and never know your peers and instructor. That is not the case at Carleton.\n\nThe CS department is growing significantly at Carleton. More classes are being offered, but not at the same pace as student enrollment. Classes in the CS average around 30-40 students which are large at Carleton. At the U though, I don't think you'll see a CS class around this size unless you're taking some graduate-level courses. I may be wrong though.\n\nWith these small class sizes, you'll receive the individual attention that you need. Need extra help? Come to office hours, schedule appointments, talk to the TA, talk to the lab assistants. Carleton, particularly the CS department, has a strong support structure for students to succeed. *If you need individual attention, then you'll get it.*\n\n**Instructors and Advising**\n\nCarleton is a *teaching institution*. The U, on the other hand, is a research institution. Every single faculty member at Carleton has a passion for teaching and come to Carleton to teach and do research secondary. This is the reverse at the U, excluding instructors who are lecturers. Each faculty member cares significantly about how well they are teaching and will do best to accommodate your needs and teaching style.\n\nThis does not mean you will not get research experience if you are interested in graduate school. The CS faculty all have research projects and *exclusive* opportunities for Carleton students to contribute to during the summer. So if you're interested in doing research, it is easier to reach out and apply. Here are some of the projects from last summer. (https://www.carleton.edu/computer-science/research/summer-2019/) Remember, you are only competing against Carleton students for these opportunities, not the thousands of CSE students at the U.\n\nIf research does not interest you, then after you declare your major at the end of your sophomore year, you'll be paired with a CS faculty as your major advisor. They'll be invested in your success hopefully.\n\n**On-Campus Life**\n\nIf you are doing PSEO, then I assume you are commuting to campus every day. One thing benefit to coming to Carleton I didn't realize before coming was that *everyone* (99.9%) of students live on campus. It is much easier to work on projects, socialize, make friends when you don't have to deal with the fact that people commute. I do not miss commuting to the U at all. Want to work on a project at 1am with a friend? You can because you both are on campus.\n\n**Class Variety**\n\nHere's one thing you should keep in mind though. Carleton is a small liberal arts institution so they are expecting you to take classes outside of CS. So you can't just take CS exclusively and leave. The idea is for you to be a well-rounded individual.\n\nBecause of this, the course selection is going to be more shallow compared to the U where you can take graduate-level courses if you qualify. Here's the link to the available courses you can take. (http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dln/guide/cscourses.pdf)\n\nYou can see that electives are offered every other year, so you may not get the opportunity to take a course you really want to take if you don't qualify your junior year.\n\n**Questions**\n\nWithout making this reply super intimidating, I'll stop there. I've enjoyed my experiences at Carleton as a CS-minded person, and with their help, I'm going to be a PhD student in the fall for CS. You can either DM me or reply if you got any other particular questions.",

Are you able to visit? Do it if you can- that\u2019s what sold me on Carleton. Everyone\u2019s really passionate and engaged.\n\nIn any case, congrats and good luck!!",

            "comment": "The admissions office will be very happy to put you in contact with current students who you could talk to in the phone. And Carleton students are very opinionated, so you\u2019re not going to just get the party line, regardless of who you talk to. Carleton has an incredible retention and graduation rate for a reason - they support their students, and the students support each other and collaborate a ton. It is a challenging school, one where, no matter who you are, you will be surrounded by people who seem smarter than you - if you\u2019re used to being at the top of your class, it can be a bit startling to be suddenly completely average.  I\u2019ve also never run into a Carleton kid who wasn\u2019t interesting.  Like, you\u2019ll meet a football player, and if you dig the slightest bit, it turns out they\u2019re also a philosophy major with crazy juggling skills. I don\u2019t know your gender, but the sciences/CS are quite welcoming to women - Carleton traditionally has turned out more female Geology majors than any other school in the nation, for example. And the last three female CS majors who I\u2019ve gotten to know well are now, respectively, in med school, at Google, and at Facebook.  If you\u2019re a single-minded person who simply loves all things CS, you might hate that Carleton requires you to take a really wide range of classes.",

If you run into another Carl of any age, you have a bond, and they will always help you out, and they\u2019re inevitably interesting people who\u2019ve gone on to do fascinating things, regardless of major or eventual job. Friends have gone into the peace corps, become a full-time potter, a solid dozen doctors, four full-time clergy, a full-time playwright, teachers, three people on the NYT bestseller list, the head of an eco-commune, someone who hikes the pacific coast trail in between his relatively boring office job. Those with boring jobs are still fascinating people who are always interesting to talk to. That said, if you want to settle in Minneapolis, the U will probably provide stronger local connections. Carleton alums will end up all over the world.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior and I am seriously considering applying ED to Carleton in the upcoming admissions cycle. While I would be ecstatic to attend Carleton, I\u2019m not super sure I would get in even with ED, so I was thinking of applying to other schools like Clark and Macalester EA, so I can go into the RD/ED2 round with at least one or two acceptances. However, I know that some colleges do not allow you to do this, so do any of you have experience applying ED1 and EA at the same time? Does Carleton allow it?\n\nUpdate: Talked to the VP of admissions: you can! You just have to withdraw EA decisions immediately if you get in ED",

So for example at Carleton you apply ED1 and simultaneously apply RD at a few other places. At University of Example though, if I wanted to apply there EA, I had to wait to apply anywhere else until I got my decision back from them. Don\u2019t think many schools still do that",

I think the biggest thing that would make Carleton my first choice is just how tight-knit the community is. Macalester being in a city is great for internship opportunities, but I love you your professor could live two blocks away from your dorm. The only two downsides of Carleton are that it is a bit far away from the airport and there isn't a huge Jewish community in the surrounding area. But, since there is a trimester system, I won't have tons of little vacations here and there, so I would only have to fly home and back a few times a year.",

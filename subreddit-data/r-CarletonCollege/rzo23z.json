            "comment": "Carleton has separate pots of financial aid for US and international students. If they can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to admit you and give you the financial aid you would need, then you simply are not admitted. Because US students get federal financial aid, it is more expensive for Carleton to provide aid for international students, but they do do so. I suspect that an international student who needs aid will need to be more of an academic or cultural standout (that is, higher ranked in their priority list) to be admitted but it certainly does happen and the pot of international aid money has grown over the past decade or so. There are sometimes strings attached to these international scholarships. I know that at times there has been a requirement to stay on campus over winter break, not sure if that still applies. I\u2019d recommend getting in touch with the international students office to get details.\n\nTL:DR: Carleton is generous to students they admit. But whether your application is considered without reference to need depends on how attractive you are to their admissions team.",

Just a bit of background, our family makes $0 annually due to my father's unexpected retirement (covid made the company financially struggle), so i was looking for around 40K from the school. Among all the schools I was accepted to, Carleton gave me the most generous amount of aid, providing me an annual amount of $42K (at first they gave me 39K, but i made an appeal and they gave me a bit more). This is right around the amount of money I indicated that I would need on my CSS profile. In general, I would say carleton is extremely generous with financial aid for international students!",

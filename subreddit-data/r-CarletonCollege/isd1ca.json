    "postText": "Hello, I am a student at r/carletonU. As your siblings up north I wanted to say hi and ask how life is like at Carleton college (the american one). Up north we mostly moved online due to covid and we're all scrambling to figure out zoom this second week of classes. Before covid, the campus was very vibrant with the trains and the tunnels. There's a whole underground tunnel system that allows people that live on res to never have to go outside. Although our mascot is a raven we also have groundhogs we call chonkers because they're obese.",

For a long time it wasn't too hard to sneak into them, but they've since been better locked and the official word is that they are now so full of steam pipes and wiring that it's hard to go through them.\n\n[This article](https://apps.carleton.edu/voice/?story_id=1488908&amp;issue_id=1488818&amp;section_id=353600) is mostly tongue in cheek but it does have some actual info at the top.",

So the tunnels were apparently quite warm.\n\nIn fact, you can often see where they run by looking at where the snow melts faster. there is one that runs right in front of the Libe.",

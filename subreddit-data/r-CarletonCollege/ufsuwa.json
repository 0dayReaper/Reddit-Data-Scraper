    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an admitted student from Minnesota currently deciding between Carleton and Williams. Is anyone familiar with where most job opportunities/internships/externships are located for Carleton students and where most grads go to live? Guessing Carleton is more midwest and Williams more east coast but not totally sure since so many students come from out of state.\n\nAlso, any other advice on deciding between the two schools would be very appreciated! I'm leaning toward Carleton right now because it's a lot closer to home (I'm pretty close with my younger siblings so It'd be tough to move so far away) but a part of me is also worried about missing out on the opportunities at Williams. Are there any big differences between job opportunities at these two schools?",

            "comment": "Literally everywhere. After graduation my classmates spread out to all around the US and the world. Is there a slightly higher density of Carleton alumni in Minneapolis? Probably, but that\u2019s by choice. You will find Carleton alumni in most major cities of the world. Off the top of my head just now, despite this killer hangover, I can name friends in London, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Ho Chi Minh, and Hong Kong. Going to Carleton (or Williams) will not pigeonhole you into any geographic distribution. \n\nSame for internships. Carleton career center will fund almost any internship or externship you want to do, anywhere you want to do it. And they give extra funding for internships done abroad. \n\nI \u2019m sure admissions could give you some hard numbers, but just think about where Carleton students come from - all over the country plus a smattering of international students.",

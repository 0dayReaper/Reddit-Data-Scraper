I would say I had a lot of diverse ECs, but I had a main focus of music and film. I also submitted a couple of my films I directed and some of my youtube music covers (I own a home studio) just to show them that I have a lot of passions and am a pretty artsy person. I'm planning to study Cinema and Media Studies btw!",

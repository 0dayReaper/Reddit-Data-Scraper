The med school coordinator is great. Carleton tends to have a very collaborative atmosphere, not hostile or competitive, and all classes are taught by professors - the only place you\u2019ll run into a TA is as extra support, say a language class with small-group language practice. It\u2019s basically an ivy-league school with Midwest nice. ",

I do admissions interviews so they give me the stats and acceptance rate for med school is over 90% as long as you're at least a B average.  Undergrad research can really set you up well especially if you want to go MD/PhD.",

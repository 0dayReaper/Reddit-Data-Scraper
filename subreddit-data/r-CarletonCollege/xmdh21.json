    "postText": "Hello! I am a prospective student interested in applying to Carleton ED1. I live in New Jersey, so I would have to take a plane to get there. I have no problem with this, but I do have a question  about luggage. Do Carleton students who fly ship their luggage, or just take what they can and buy dorm supplies once they get there?",

            "comment": "It varies! Honestly a lot of people end up driving up to Carleton to live in freshman year, often taking multiple days to drive. That\u2019s what I did when I moved from over 600 miles away. A lot of people do wait to buy stuff until they\u2019re at Carleton, and/or buy stuff online that gets shipped directly to Carleton. Some people do ship stuff from home to Carleton but it\u2019s definitely awkward to do depending on size/quantity. May be cheaper to drive there!",

            "comment": "In my experience, there was a lot of SUVs and minivans around for first year move-ins (that was me and my parents, too), but I'm sure there are students who came from farther afield who didn't drive in. Some of those ones that I knew didn't bring a lot from home, tbh. But I also know that dorm decorating and extensive personalization (more than just posters on the wall and choosing your own bedspread) has become much more of a \"thing\" now than it was even a decade ago, so I don't know how much has changed in regards to the quantity of student stuff.\n\nIn between years (over the summer) you can store your belongings at the college for a fee, so the big moves are usually on either side of your Carleton experience (first year move in, senior year move out). But it's also really easy to get a lot of necessities once you get there - there's a Target in town and Amazon is certainly more ubiquitous now than when I graduated. I've seen recent pictures on social media of the Carleton mail room getting ready for the new school year and it certainly seems PACKED!\n\n(I hope this helps!)",

I was one of those who came from farther afield\u2014I just flew with one duffel full of essentials and bought everything else I needed there, mostly at Target. You will thank yourself when you don\u2019t have boxes upon boxes of stuff to deal with (and pay to store) at the end of the year.\n\nI did end up driving home after senior year, but mostly because I had too many things to fly back with at that point. It was a lot of fun but wouldn\u2019t have been practical on the regular.",

When I wasn't using it, I stored it under my bed as its own storage container during the year. I usually kept my bed a bit higher to fit lots of stuff under there, at one point even having a mini-fridge under my bed (and this did mean that I would basically have to jump to get on).",

            "comment": "I took Amtrak from the west coast!   At the time (1993) they didn\u2019t seem to have a maximum luggage allowance, or it was really high, so I had several boxes and bags with me, plenty to get started.  I met three other Carls on the same train and we hung out for the 36-hour ride in coach, sleeping on the floor of the lounge car occasionally.   Things were a bit more lax back then I think?\n\nI stored things for a small fee during breaks but ended up working over summer and winter breaks several times, too.\n\nYou need a lot less than you think, though.   Lots of people sell or give away things as they move around, too.   Not sure if the NNB (noon news bulletin) still exists in any form, but you could score a lot of things there, too.\n\nGood luck on your application and have fun!",

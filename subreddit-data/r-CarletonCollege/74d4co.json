Back several decades ago they weren't locked, and I guess some bad stuff happened in there so they changed the policy to locking them. I had a classmate who was buddies with the janitorial crew and once in a blue moon got \"accidental access\" (oops the maintenance crew forgot to lock a certain door oh man!) and would lead a clandestine tour down there. Lots of neat graffiti!",

You can get a rough idea of where they are if you look right after the first light snow for where it melts first. \n\nAt least one upper classmen in nourse knows how to get in. That was where people went in when I was there.\n\nI also went in when I worked for facilities, they aren't that cool tbh ",

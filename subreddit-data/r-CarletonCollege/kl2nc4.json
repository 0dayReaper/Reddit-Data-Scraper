    "postText": "Hello friends,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHappy holidays all! I'm a freshman and a member of TRIO. My academic advisor is a staff from TRIO and I really don't vibe with her much. As simple as that. I met her a few times and know that I don't 'enjoy' working with her but I can 'deal' with her till my junior year when I have to switch to another advisor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI talked to Al about changing my advisor but he strongly disagreed with this idea. What should I do at this point? I want to make a meaningful connection with my advisor and I know it is not going to happen with the one I have. By the way, I heard that many others don't count on their advisor very much and idk maybe it's something that it is? Anyway, do you think should I contact the Dean of Students? Talk to Al again? write a formal letter? Any thoughts? Suggestion?",

            "comment": "Hey!  Quick point first: this is reddit and while we are happy to offer our advice, know that we don't know everything.\n\nFrom what I vaguely remember, you get ~~two advisors as a TRIO student~~, right? One from TRIO and one not; have you reached out to them?\n\nEdit: seems I'm wrong, only two if you're also in another program (FOCUS, Posse, QB, etc.).  Source: friend who was TRIO senior PL last year\n\nOtherwise, it's up to you.  You're right in that some students (a lot of them) don't use their advisor for much else than confirming the classes they'll take next term.  My best friend, actively disliked her advisor (different from your case) and only met with them to do that. For me, my first year, I relied on my advisor (Trey from TRIO) quite a bit for both academic and personal advice and it was super helpful (but again, not everyone does).  For my major advisor, I was fairly indifferent and only met once a term to inform them (rather than discuss) the courses I would take (and that was totally fine).\n\nIf you are in the case where you feel you would benefit from academic or personal help from an advisor and your TRIO advisor isn't doing it, then it's worth it to talk to Dean Livingston (or even Trey) to see what can be done.  But it's not the end of the world if it doesn't work out, your advisor can be in your life as much or as little as you want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps!",

            "comment": "I totally agree with the comment, but also wanted to suggest pursuing that sort of relationship with a different professor, especially if there's some other professor that you vibe with really well.  I've had many talks with one of my Psychology profs about my academic future that have been as helpful (or more so) than conversations I've had with my official advisor.  \n\nStart by going to their office hours- you don't necessarily have to have a specific question, although that can serve as a way to get the conversation started.  It definitely feels intimidating at first, but remember that office hours are NOT detention and are just another resource.  Plus, honestly, professors get lonely!! So if you're at all interested in their field, research, or even hobbies, definitely try reaching out.\n\nPlus, if you do end up getting an official advisor change, it might help if you've already talked to the person that you'd like to become your new advisor.  (My source for this: as part of the petition to add another major, you have to find your own advisor for your second major.)",

            "comment": "I agree with the above comments for sure. But here is a couple things from my perspective as a fellow TRIO student:\n\n\nYou can message Trey and ask to be paired with a different TRIO advisor, they may be able to do that\n\n\nYou will get a new, major-specific advisor your 6th term, so it\u2019s sooner than you think\n\n\nYou really don\u2019t need your advisor for much, especially if you are proactive in planning out classes. As someone else suggested, you can foster an advisor-like relationship with another professor and they can help you out as well\n\n\nFinally, I know the two possible staff people you\u2019re taking about and they\u2019re both incredibly kind. Try getting to know your person more. If you get more involved with TRIO, you\u2019ll also find that the three advisors all work with/talk to each other a lot as well",

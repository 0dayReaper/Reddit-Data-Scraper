    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am thinking of applying to Carleton College. My GPA is only about a 3.6 UW but I take full IB (I guess it would be equivalent to AP seminar for you American folks). I am unsure about my likelihood of getting in. My college advisor believes that I have a fairly solid chance since I am a good writer and have great ECs. I just want to ask if there are any tips for boosting my application (I am in my junior year and would be applying for fall ED next year. Also please tell me what the environment is like overall. \n\nThank you for reading :)",

I would say try to get as many diverse ECs as possible while you can, and try to show the school that ur someone capable of making a difference in ur community. at least for me, i think that's what made the difference. also, i think liberal arts colleges in general care a lot about if you actually want to go to their school or not. i would say attend information sessions and maybe visit the campus if possible to show the school that carleton is in fact ur top-choice college!",

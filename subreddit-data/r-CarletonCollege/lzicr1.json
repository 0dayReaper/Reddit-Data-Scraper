They\u2019re trying to figure out what to study before the placement exam because they only had 2 years of mediocre high school Spanish, 2 years ago (but willing to do work now to place out of at least a few quarters). \n\nAlso is the placement exam just reading and writing, or also listening and speaking? Thanks!",

There\u2019s really no way to \u201cstudy\u201d for the placement, it\u2019s truly about language ability. But I\u2019m here to say if they are going to end up starting in 101, it\u2019s actually so great!",

Do you think reviewing some of the Gente Nivel Basico early chapters would be useful?\nPs was the placement exam super hard/surprising in some way? Or was it just not your day? \ud83d\ude09",

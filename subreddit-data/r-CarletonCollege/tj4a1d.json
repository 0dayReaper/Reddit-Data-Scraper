That being said everyone\u2019s experience is different but I have never personally heard of anyone experiencing major problems because they are a poc at Carleton.\n\nEdit: Almost forgot to mention that the food has very little diversity and in general is not great. Plan to learn how to cook your childhood favorites to feel at home.",

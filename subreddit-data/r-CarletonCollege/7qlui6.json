I definitely recommend going to one of the prospective student days or schedule a visit with the admissions office. You'll be able to spend a night or 2 on campus with some students, get a feel for the daily routine, and hopefully get an idea of what college life is.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to PM me ",

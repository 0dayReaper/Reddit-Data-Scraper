    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI submitted my RD app to Carleton a month ago (I was going to submit ED II but my parents wouldn't let me as I haven't visited). Carleton is my top choice, I love everything I've read. That being said, do current Carls think the admissions process is holistic? I have a couple of B+s and one B on my report card, and emailed an admissions officer clarifying the grades and saying how much I love Carleton. I only emailed because my counselor called them to ask about ED II, and the admissions officer said she remembered my name and they spoke about me for a bit, and the AO mentioned that my grades aren't as strong as some of the other applicants because of the Bs. That being said, I have a 3.98 (4.0 is an A) weighted and a 3.77 (3.67 is an A-) unweighted, so it's not like I have a really bad average. I also have good extracurriculars and good test scores, plus an art portfolio (English is my intended major). \n\nSorry if this seems a little disjointed! I love Carleton and would just like input from people who currently go there/have already gotten in :)",

            "comment": "&gt; AO mentioned that my grades aren't as strong as some of the other applicants because of the Bs. \n\nClass of 2020 here-- Things have definitely gotten a little more competitive than when I applied, but I think a 3.77 GPA is still very good. (I got in with good SAT scores and a lower GPA, so I wouldn't stress about it too much!)  This comment from Admissions seems pretty odd and slightly unprofessional, which surprises me. I'd imagine every application has at least a few B's, which is honestly a respectable grade in a hard course, so I am not sure why they said this. (Are there more concerning things on your transcript you're not telling us, OP? ;) )\n\nTo answer your question on admissions, yes, they are definitely holistic. What this means, however, is that admissions will usually look for people who really stand out in one way or another, ie not your typical \"well-rounded\" applicant. They also take into account your recommendations, essays, and the \"why Carleton\" or whatever form that Carleton specific essay is in now. \n\nI know how much I hated hearing this as a high school senior, but really, the only thing you can do now is wait. Online \"chance-me\" forums are not helpful. The admissions office makes the only decision that matters. *The Carletonian* j[ust published an article on ED admissions](https://thecarletonian.com/2020/02/07/early-decision-sees-34-acceptance-rate-demographics-similar-to-recent-years/), though, which might be interesting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDM me if you have any questions about the Carleton experience! Good luck on your applications.",

Yeah, she said that compared to the other applications she had received mine wasn't as strong because of the Bs... but, I only have 5 Bs, 4 are B+s, and I take every AP I can, so it's not like I'm not challenging myself....\n\nAnd I just read the article, thank you for that! I think on paper I seem to fit into what Carleton sort of wants. The waiting game kind of sucks, but I know that if I don't get in then it just wasn't meant to be.\n\nI'll take you up on that offer if I have any more questions, thank you so much! Just trying not to get too attached in case I end up getting the dreaded denied letter...",

I think the school will recognize that you WANT to be there. Carelton seems to be a place that's not for everyone and they will want someone who wants to be part of the  community. Good luck BTW. Hope it works out. I didn't think they would take me but here we are so you never know!",

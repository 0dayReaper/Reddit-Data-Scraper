    "postText": "I\u2019m an sophomore international student at Olaf and honestly I\u2019m not enjoying it. Without a car I can\u2019t go into the cities ($45 for a round trip bus ticket!!!!) and to get a packet of crisps from target is a 2 hour excursion on the free bus. I have 3 senior friends who are all graduating, so next year will be fun. I hate being isolated on campus and I can\u2019t even walk into town to sit in a cafe between classes or walk on main street on a Friday night. \nThe kicker is I almost went to carleton instead, is its proximity to town really that much better or am I just imagining that as I drown myself in self pity?",

            "comment": "Some Carleton students do make use of their proximity to town-- I know people who go to blue monday or little joy just about every day. I think this is a pretty small group, though, and most students head  to town 1x/week or less. Just a guess. I suppose it is pretty convenient for those who make use of it, but not a huge deal to most",

Not that there's anything to do at the moment.  And to be fair, everything sucks right now.  Everywhere.   Most of your friends are gone. Being able to go to the cities right now won't get you anything anyway - they're even more closed down than we are. If you liked online classes, you wouldn't be going to a small liberal arts school - of course you're unhappy.  We're all unhappy.  The weather isn't helping. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Also, $45/round trip? Has it really doubled in the last year??)",

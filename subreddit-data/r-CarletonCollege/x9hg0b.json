You've posted 3 times this week in this subreddit asking how to get into Carleton and what stats previous admitted students had. In general, I don't think this information will ease your worries about getting into a particular college or really help you in your search.\n\nI'm currently an upperclassman who was accepted after applying RD with lower stats and honors than many of the students who go here have. I was however, heavily involved in my community, and genuinely interested in being at a place like Carleton.\n\nDo your best in your last year of high school, interview, and apply here. Try to be authentic about what you want out of going to Carleton. I think that will give you your best shot at getting in.\n\nGood luck!",

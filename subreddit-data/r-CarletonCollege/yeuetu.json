    "postText": "The Board of Trustees is meeting in the Weitz Center from today until Saturday. Divest Carleton is holding an occupation to protest their continued investment in industries that are actively destroying our planet, despite overwhelming student body support for divestment. Come on over! You don\u2019t have to stay the whole time \u2014 you can just to hang out for a bit or do some homework. We\u2019ve got free food, movies, jigsaw puzzles and juggling lessons. Your presence sends a message to the board that students have a voice and we will use it.",

Do you guys have a lot of research opportunities? Are there problems taking upper level classes ?are most physics majors applying to grad school? \n\nBonus math joke : what happiness when you cross a banana with an elephant? \n\n| Banana | * | elephant |* sin(theta)",

The professors there are world class researchers and most importantly, great instructors.  Also, if you want to look into doing research, there are numerous opportunities to collaborate with professors over the summer. Here's a great article about Carleton Physics students and what they do over the summer. https://apps.carleton.edu/now/stories/?story_id=1636185",

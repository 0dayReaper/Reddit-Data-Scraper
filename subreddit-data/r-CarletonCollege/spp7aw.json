This year, a team of cupids brought Datamatch to **Carleton!**\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nJust sign up at [datamatch.me](https://datamatch.me/), create an online profile and take a 5-minute long not-so-serious survey. Then, on Valentine's Day, your \\~10 (romantic or platonic) matches will be \\*magically\\* revealed, and you can proceed as you please: ignore them, slide into their DMs, or wave awkwardly across the lecture hall. It's up to you!",

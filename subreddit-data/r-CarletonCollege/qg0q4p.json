    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an international student who really loves what Carleton offers. However, I'd like to state that I'm looking for a college where I can study while also pursuing my interests without sacrificing time in any of those areas. I would want to maintain a CGPA above 3.8 while doing other things that would take some hours of my day every day. I would probably major in Computer Science. Should I ED at Carleton, given that I love everything else it offers but the trimester and the academic pressure from what I've heard intimidates me?",

I\u2019m a 2013 grad and I was able to spend 3-4 hours a day after classes playing sports, while keeping a 3.4 without much angst. Honestly, the trimester set-up is really fantastic, only taking 3 classes is way easier to focus on and make sure everything gets done. If you sneak in a couple half term classes or have AP credits then you can do 1-2 terms with just 2 classes when there\u2019s a particular class you want to focus on, or if you just want an easy senior spring.",

Grad schools generally know which schools inflate headed and can adjust.\n\n3.8 will require non trivial effort but is not crazy, that was around the cutoff for magna cum laude when I graduated. You may have to compromise on something at times.",

I had never heard of such a thing, and neither had my parents nor college age family members. Not even a private college counselor I consulted knew what to do besides literally \"jot\" down a few words that I thought of. \n\nDo any current Carls have any insight? Do they really want just a few words? Does it matter at all?",

We do have a 3-2 program but it\u2019s honestly not that popular because people tend to want to stick around! More info: https://www.carleton.edu/engineering/about/",

When Interviewed, I asked my interviewer about the 3-2 program and she said that nobody did it when she was there because people loved Carleton so much. She said she knew a few ppl who wanted to do the 3-2 program but ended up not doing it because they loved the school so much and didn't want to leave",

The majority of students drink on the weekends, and it isn't hard to drink a LOT if that is what you are into. Where I would say Carleton is a little different than bigger state schools is the nature of the parties. In general when I was at Carleton, parties were relatively small. I'd get together with a smaller group of friends, maybe 4-10 people, and we'd pregame together. After a couple of hours, maybe we would head out and meet up with another group, or go to a small dorm party or party in one of the campus owned houses. You don't have giant frat parties and parties with huge numbers of students aren't unheard of but aren't super common either. You also don't have as much partying during the week as you might at a bigger school, but most students are drinking quite a bit most Friday and Saturday nights. If you are looking to do more than drink, there is definitely a scene for that too. \n\nI'll say that 10 years post college, Carleton was the most fun partying I ever had. Highly recommend it.",

I happened to visit the campus pre-pandemic (in the first half of Fall Term 2019) during a weekend (either 3rd or 4th week).\n\nI was shocked at how quiet the campus was.  Admittedly, the weather was very cold (record breaking, in fact).  But, still, I know from earlier visits to my alma mater (2015 was my previous visit) that there should've been at least some activity.  I kept checking my phone to see if some terrible national or local tragedy had occurred.  During my time as a student, a Friday / Saturday night that early in the term would be rocking with at least a few parties.  However, this particular weekend I was on the Carleton campus, you could hear a pin drop in Sayles Hill all the way from Goodhue.\n\nSo, I don't know how to vote on your poll.\n\nDuring my time (and indeed, any time up until around the mid 2010s) I would say \"Parties happen on occasion\" (mainly weekends up until late in the term).\n\nToday?  Maybe today's students party differently?  Maybe they all sit at their computers playing video games?  I dunno.",

I still think you're able to answer the question perfectly fine without mentioning the pandemic, but if the pandemic has affected you in anyway regarding your personal impact on the school then I would mention it.\n\nYou could tie your academics or extracurriculars into that question. For example, if you did some niche club you could mention how you're excited to share that with Carleton or that you know there exists a club that does your specific activity. That would show you did your research about the school too. Or if you have any personal experiences/hardships that would be impactful to Carleton's environment.\n\nHopefully that's helpful, if you got anymore questions, about Carleton or the college application process, feel free to reply or DM. Don't know why there's persistent accounts bashing Carleton, but they usually delete their responses cause they have no backbone. Good luck on your college search, I'm sure you'll do fine wherever you go!",

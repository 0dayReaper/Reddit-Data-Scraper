Every reaction to me telling them I'm gay has just been \"oh cool!\" and then move on.\n\nThere's also plenty of intersectional clubs that incorporate the queer identity. For example, Queer Spiritz is a club for lgbtq+ students that want to be more connected to their inner spirituality/culture. Additionally, Carleton has a Gender and Sexuality Center where you can receive support for affirming your sexual orientation/gender identity (letting you try on binders, for example).",

I haven't experienced any hate for being gay, and I've even been lucky enough to find a friend group of eight where most of us are queer. There is also a Gender and Sexuality Center (GSC) you can visit anytime to meet other LGBTQ+ students. The GSC has tea times every Friday from 4-5 where you can eat snacks, drink tea/water, and chat with others! All in all, there are definitely gay people at Carleton!",

The vast majority of my friends from Carleton are in the LGBTQ+ community (with only a handful openly identifying as such before Carleton) and I actually came to terms with my own sexuality after coming from a somewhat conservative suburb in the Mid-Atlantic. Leaving Carleton was so sad, because it was the most LGBTQ+ affirming community I have ever existed in. \n\nI can't speak much to the dating scene since I became Carleton-married pretty early on (and am actually marrying said Carl tomorrow/later today!)",

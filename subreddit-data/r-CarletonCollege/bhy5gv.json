    "postText": "Admitted for Fall 2019.  It is hard to judge the career center because without a PIN, you don\u2019t have access. I looked at upcoming events and those looked very disappointing and rare.  Do companies come to campus. Is it easy to find externships in other states - like C A?  Does the Career Center offer contests for students to design something or offer career oriented group challenges?  Do they publish a lot of opportunities that help you know where to apply without having to hunt down the opportunities too?  Please tell me about your experiences.",

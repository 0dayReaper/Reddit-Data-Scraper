    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a firstyear at Washington and Lee University and I've been accepted for a fall 2022 transfer to Carleton. I've loved the academics here at W&amp;L and I'm planning on a double major in physics and philosophy, but the overall culture and student life at the school hasn't been a great fit. The school's culture is overall very southern and conservative. I'm originally from the midwest but have lived in upstate NY for the past 6 years. I'm a non-drinker that doesn't fit into the school's party culture and greek life, and I think Carleton will be a better fit socially.\n\nI'd love to hear from current students, especially transfers. How did transferring work out for you? How's the overall culture and social scene? Also, anything on the physics and philosophy depts. would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Like Homer, I'm also a non-transfer alum.\n\nYeah, Carleton is sort of the polar opposite of Washington &amp; Lee in terms of culture and vibe.\n\nVery liberal, even for me, coming from one of the most liberal states in the country.  You'll find a lot more of the social justice types and activists at Carleton than you would at W&amp;L.  There's also more of the tree-hugging, granola, bohemian, hippie free-spirit types as well.  Only about 2% of the student body identifies as conservative.\n\nIn my time, there was a large drinking and drug culture.  However, back then, almost every school in the country had large amounts of alcohol, so Carleton really wasn't anything special in regards to booze.  I'm under the impression there's less alcohol and less partying today.  There are no frats.  Or sororities.  Except for one all-female floor, housing is gender neutral.  Dorm bathrooms are gender neutral by default.\n\nIf you're going to double major, keep in mind you need to do comps twice.  Probably once in your junior year and once in your senior year.  The Physics Department recently moved into a new building, Anderson Hall.",

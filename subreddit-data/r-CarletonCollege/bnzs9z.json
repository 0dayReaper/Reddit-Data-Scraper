    "postText": "I'm an international student planning to apply to Carleton. I think I'm gonna choose CS as my major.   \nConsidering my family's financial condition, I don't think I'll be able to attend without a fully funded scholarship. I've some national level awards (national Physics Olympiad, national high school programming contest etc) and have formed a physics club to support my juniors in Physics Olympiad. I'm hoping to get a SAT score of something around 1500. With this score and my ECs, do I have a shot at getting a fully funded scholarship or is the chance very slim?",

            "comment": "Not an international student, but Carleton's financial aid is a need-based system. This means that they don't take into account any academic merit (theoretically, in practice could be a different story) and only take into account the financial need of the student. As to a full-ride, it depends on how they determine your \"need\". Hope this helps and good luck!",

                            "comment": "It may have changed a little bit since I have applied but there are two different areas for financial aid. \n\n**Applying** I believe Carleton used to be *Need-Blind* (meaning they do not take financial need into account for application decisions. \n\nI also believe you may be right that they have since switched to *Need-Aware* (meaning they do take financial need into account for application decisions). \n\nPersonally, I think it's unfortunate to have a need-aware system but that's just my opinion. \n\n\nAnd then there's the case of actual **Financial Aid** in which Carleton is Need-Based.\n\nEdit:  Not sure if your asking about your chances of getting in or what your financial aid package would be if you got accepted. As to getting in, (and this is my understanding for domestic students and, while I don't believe it differed for international students, I can't say for sure) I think you can have a very good chance of getting in and you should definitely apply!  As to your financial aid package, I honestly don't know. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help with that aspect. Carleton has a financial aid calculator that you can try out for prospective students. I'll find that link for you.\n\nEdit2: [Carleton Net Price Calculator.](https://www.carleton.edu/admissions/apply/afford/aid-estimators/npc/) Again, not sure how this differs for international students but I hope it can give you a ballpark. And if anything, you are always extremely welcomed to call the admissions office and/or the financial aid office for more information. Or if calling presents challenges, you can email them or if you pm me with specific questions, I can go to them for you and ask them on your behalf.",

It's explicitly for low-income students (including international students) and it provides binding full-ride and near-full-ride scholarships. You sound like a great candidate for it. Carleton is need-aware (which I wish they would change), but they admit a handful of full-ride students through QB every year and at least a dozen of the nearly full-ride scholarships. QB also lets you apply this way to several other top-tier US schools.\n\nhttps://www.questbridge.org",

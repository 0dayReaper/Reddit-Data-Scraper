    "postText": "Are you a prospective parent or student (or even an Admitted one, at that)? Do you want to visit Carleton to get that in-person experience? Here are our policies.\n\n**Can I visit?**\n\nCarleton (the students, staff, and faculty) is still under COVID restrictions. This means that students are being told to limit their travels as much as possible. \"[Unnecessary travel beyond Northfield continues to be prohibited](https://www.carleton.edu/covid/frequently-asked-questions/faq-students/#acc1_4)\" is part of the Covenant that all students have signed to be on campus. Our students have made those promises and we ask that you, too, avoid any unnecessary travel to our campus.\n\n**However...**\n\nCarleton is an open campus, meaning there are no physical barriers preventing the Northfield community from being on campus. We know some families are still visiting campus and, if this applies to you, we want this to be done as safely as possible.\n\n**What can I do if I visit?**\n\nThere are currently no official (or unofficial) events for you to partake in.  The safest option for your visit is to do an in-car drive around campus, but we know you probably didn't drive/fly all the way here to stay in your car. Walking around campus is possible, you will be required to wear a mask, maintain a 6-foot distance from others, and, do note, that **you will not be permitted within any building**. All of our buildings are locked and require a Carleton ID to enter.\n\nCampus really is beautiful.  'Tis the time of spring right now (despite the dark clouds outside my window right now) and flowers are blooming. A great option is to take a stroll through our [800-acre Arboretum](https://www.carleton.edu/arboretum/) (probably not all 800-acres though). The town of Northfield is a quick 30-second walk from our townhouses is a very friendly place to walk through.  Most businesses are open in some fashion and getting to know the town is just as important as getting to know the campus.  If do you go into town, Hogan Brothers serves delicious ice cream (but be warned, their serving sizes are HUGE!)\n\n**Can I do a tour if I visit?**\n\nNo, Carleton's Admissions office is officially closed to on-campus activities. (Most Admissions Officers are currently working from home).\n\n**What other options do I have?**\n\nThe Admissions office has put together many, many online events that are aimed to help students in their college search process. You can find a list of[ Virtual Opportunities here](https://www.carleton.edu/admissions/visit/virtual/) and a[ calendar of scheduled events here](https://www.admissions.carleton.edu/portal/visit). For Accepted Students, Carleton Admissions has put on[ special events](https://www.carleton.edu/admissions/visit/ase/) for the month of April just for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Regarding this Subreddit: For as long as this post is Stickied, all questions regarding visits must be asked as a reply here. New posts on this topic will be removed. Eliciting students currently on campus for a private tour (with or without a \"compensation for their time\") will be met with a temp ban.*",

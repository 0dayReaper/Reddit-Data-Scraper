    "postText": "Hi! This is like my first time posting, so I apologize in advance for any awkward mistakes. \n\nI'm an American Citizen currently living in the Middle East (Lebanon, to be exact), but am coming back to the States in July. I'm really interested in coming to Carelton, mostly because I like to travel, have friends in the area, and heard wonderful things about it! However, as most college students are, I'm tight on cash. I have a friend who goes to Carleton who pays $4,000 a year in tuition, and she said Americans could get the same discount. Could anyone confirm this, or offer me any advice? Thanks!\n\nTL;DR , I want to come to Carleton but am flat broke. Help!",

Explain to them you are interested in attending Carleton but do not have the means.  They may be willing to help you out.  The first step though is contacting admissions.",

            "comment": "[Here](https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/sfs/prospective/FA_Process_New_Students/) is Carleton's financial aid page.  The amount of aid you get will depend on what the US government (or is it The College Board, I can never remember) determines you can pay, based on you and your parents' tax documents, bank documents, and some other stuff.  If admitted, I believe Carleton will meet whatever need you can prove you have based on that.  Not quite sure about the timing, but you don't have to include this information in your actual application for admission, merely that you intend to apply for aid.  Also, of course, it's complicated because you're living abroad -- it's beyond the scope of anything I know about.  I'm no expert on this stuff (especially in your situation), so I'd recommend poking around that page for a while.",

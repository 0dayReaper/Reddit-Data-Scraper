    "postText": "I was so happy yesterday when I learned that I was accepted :,)) !! My family and friends were all so happy for me because they all knew how much I loved this school. But I would love to know more about the school itself!\n\n1. How is the Cinema and Media Studies major at Carleton and which careers do alumni of this major usually end up in? How many students are usually in this major?? I always saw myself working in the broadcasting or advertisement industry. Do many students from this major end up working in similar areas?\n2. What are Carleton students like? I'm a big city girl and someone who is very social and loves making friends, but I was a little worried when I learned that Carleton was in a rural area. How is the social life at Carleton, and how do students \"have fun\"? Do people get along well and become close friends with each other?\n3. Is partying a thing in Carleton? Is there Greek life?\n4. I am an Asian girl and have been going to an all-Asian school in a very homogenous country all my life. Is there anything I need to be prepared for? Is diversity really that lacking at Carleton?\n\nThank you so much in advance!! &lt;3",

Too busy between school, sports, and having a good time with his friends, whereas most of his high school friends, including several that went to ivy league schools, spend a significant portion of the week playing games online.....This seems to be a 100% school- all in on academics, and all in on social activities.  \n\nYes parties can be found. \n\nStudents tend to be liberal, accepting, and not too self conscious relative to other highly regarded LACs.\n\nHe has friends from all over the world. But school is still predominantly Caucasian,  although they're actively working to change that.  He Came from a large, highly regarded public high school, in a city of about a 100000 people. He had no issues adapting to a school that's smaller than his high school.  He 100% loves being there.  It's a challenging, motivating place. He has a number of friends at ivies, they don't seem to be having the all around experience that he's having.  Even though the town is right next to the college, it seems most students spend most of their time on campus. And from what he says, the -25f winter days don't stop anything from happening. Get a good ( I mean really good)  winter coat.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m about to declare myself a CAMS major so I hope I can give some good context.\n\n1. Information on career paths and stuff about the CAMS major can either be found on the carleton website as well as on the career center website. They have some really cool resources that will show you exactly where various people of a certain major have gone to work or ended up. You can probably email any of the career center folks to get the info\n\n2. I grew up in New York City and the adjustment to Northfield is huge. I am still not fully used to how early all the restaurants and stores close. Most of the social activities are found on campus, rather than off campus. Depending on whether you like to party and stuff you\u2019ll find different degrees of success in finding stuff to do for fun. My favorite activities to do with friends are mostly doing stuff in dorm rooms together like playing games, watching movies, going to sayles to play pool, or doing things that I probably cannot mention as a moderator of this subreddit because they haven\u2019t been legalized yet. You can also try and break into the secret tunnels but there\u2019s no way you don\u2019t get caught by security.\n\n3. There is absolutely no Greek life on campus. However, there are still parties. They are pretty boring in my opinion though so you have to pregame usually. I also am not a fan of house parties and prefer to have a chill party where me and my friends listen to music, so we do that instead. I know lots of people who agree with me and spend their weekend nights in other fun ways, it all just depends on what you enjoy. Just make sure to be careful if you go to Porch house because it\u2019s gross \n\n4. Although I\u2019m a white guy I do know a good bit about diversity at Carleton. It is extremely lacking despite many claims that it is not. There was once a private consultant brought in to survey diversity and equity at carleton and it was determined that carleton was dead last in most metrics compared to other notable liberal arts colleges. I have BIPOC friends who express frustration at the challenge of going to a primarily white institution. Carleton also has diversity issues within the faculty, with there currently being only one BIPOC tenure-track professor, and only one tenured black professor. (Eddie O\u2019Byrn and Thabiti Willis, respectively, both fantastic and fun professors who\u2019s classes you should take) however, I don\u2019t want to scare you. There is still plenty of student led support and student organizations where BIPOC and other minority groups (Jews and queer folk like me, etc) can find community and people like them. Social life at carleton can be very inviting, despite how small the school is. \n\nI hope my answers have helped, and I can try and contact people I know if you would like a specific Asian or BIPOC perspective rather than my own. Congrats on getting accepted!!!",

It\u2019s gross, in my opinion, because it is the closest thing that there is to a frat house on campus. It\u2019s run down, the floor is usually sticky with dried up beer, it smells funky, and in the basement where people are supposed to be dancing, there is literally a corner with a couch that (I have been told) is called the piss couch (for obvious reasons). I don\u2019t want to scare you from carleton with this because there are obviously worse and more gross frat-adjacent houses across the world but it\u2019s just a word to the wise. Also since I\u2019m ranting anyways the music they play sucks anyways and the eponymous porch reeks of cigarettes.",

For question 1, I took digital foundations which is one of the CAMS intro classes and loved it so much that I\u2019m taking another class with the same Professor. Would highly recommend.\n\nFor question four, I come from one of the most predominantly asian parts of America and while it was a little bit of an adjustment, I thought there was decent diversity for asian people. The same may unfortunately not be true for other bipoc people but there are a large amount of asian international students and asian-Americans at Carleton.\n\nOne thing I will say is that the biggest adjustment came from bland dining hall food as there are almost no good asian food options. Many students have to learn to cook for themselves to feel at home.",

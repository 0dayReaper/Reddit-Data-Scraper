    "postText": "I\u2019m looking into applying to Carleton as an incoming freshman. Current students, do you find it difficult adjusting to a trimester system and being \u201coff\u201d from people back home? Is it awkward having a lot of time off from November to January and leaving for college/coming back for summer break later than people in your hometown? I\u2019m worried about the potential FOMO.",

            "comment": "I'm a 2020 alumn. I copy/pasted this from a PM I got about the same question. \n\nI really like the trimester system! Taking 3 classes per term makes me feel like I can really concentrate on those three. 10 weeks/term seems a bit fast and it definitely is haha. Basically just a month in and you're already preparing for midterms. But one thing I really find amusing is how, during the term, you live by those 10 weeks. There's no \"want to meet up on October xx? It's all just \"want to meet on 4th Friday?\" Or when asked how you're doing, you can say \"oh well it's 8th week, y'know\" and that tells all haha.\n\nWinter break is a bit of an oddity (from Thanksgiving to new year) and it's a bit long. But most students find a way to fill their time. If it's a trip somewhere tropical (or back home to LA \"winter\" for me who didn't have the $$ for a tropical vacation haha) or a study abroad program (Carleton has a few that run over winter break but most are during the term) or an externship through our career center (I did one where I shadowed a judge bc I was interested in a career in the law at the time).\n\nAdding a bit more specific to your question: \n\nAdjusting to the schedule wasn't hard, it's going from HS to college and everything is basically new. The biggest change was the daily schedule (going from 7am-3pm in hs to 24/7 in college). \n\nWinter break is long but there are things to do (mentioned above). not awkward \n\nAt the end of the year, it can feel a bit like that when most of your friends at other colleges get off in May and you still have a few weeks left for finals until the first week of June. \nI'll say that for me, I never went back home over summer - I always stayed on campus for a summer job (which meant I always got to attend graduation and say bye to my senior friends) and I didn't have the fomo feeling.",

I honestly loved the trimester system. It\u2019s go go go and you are never bored, and then when you\u2019re on break, it\u2019s truly a break. Summers you get to see people and winter you have all this time to relax. It\u2019s also super predictable and flies by",

One is a senior in college and one is a senior in high school and applying to colleges now.\n\nCarelton was a good experience for me, but if I am being honest I was not mature enough to be ready for the academic pressure.  Make no mistake, Carelton is a seriously rigorous school, and the trimesters, at least for me, made a challenging situation even more difficult.  In retrospect, if I could change anything about Carleton, it would be the trimester.  For me, I like to really dig into a subject and explore it completely, and I felt that in trimester system things just went too fast.\n\nWith that said, if I got through it you probably can too.  I met a lot of great people at Carleton and it quickly became my second home.  My oldest got into Carleton, but he is an amazing cellist and baseball player, and he didn't feel Carleton was really meeting his extracurricular interests.  I am hopeful my youngest will apply to Carleton though, as it seems a better fit for him.",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2021 and am currently in grad school at a semester-based university, and I miss the trimester system more than I expected. \n\nIt was so lovely going home for Thanksgiving and genuinely being done with school, instead of spending Thanksgiving doing homework and having to return for two weeks in December to take final exams. A lot of my friends did externships or traveled over winter break. Honestly, I usually just rested at home and found it to be very relaxing.\n\nThe ten week schedule is also nice because it allows you to take more courses throughout the year. If there happens to be a course you dislike, it's more tolerable because you only have to endure it for ten weeks instead of fourteen. \n\nBiggest issues with the trimester schedule are 1) it's intense and incredibly fast-paced, and 2) it can be challenging (but definitely doable) finding an internship that will accommodate a June/July start",

            "comment": "I am not a Carleton alum, but I am trying to build enough Reddit karma so that my attempted post here stops getting marked as spam.\n\nAnyhoo, in researching Carleton, I see a lot of posts expressing concern about Carleton's trimester system, which I've found a little baffling. It just doesn't seem like a big deal to me. I went to UCLA in the late 90's, which has a quarter system that doesn't end until mid-June. Plenty of schools have similar systems. I don't remember classes being particularly fast paced, but I did like being able to take more classes per year. (I went back on the semester system for law school.) \n\nAnd I see Carleton's pre-Thanksgiving end to the fall trimester as a huge advantage. I had many a Thanksgiving ruined as an undergrad and law school student because I had finals right after Thanksgiving break. Plus, as someone based on the west coast, it'd save a lot of money to avoid two flights home in two consecutive months.",

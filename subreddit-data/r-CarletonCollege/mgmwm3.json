Is there a lot of pressure to have coding experience as a freshman? I\u2019ve also thought a lot about chemistry, is that any good here? Thanks for your time!",

            "comment": "Congrats on being admitted! Fair warning, I wasn't a CS (what we call compsci) major but I did take most of the required courses for the major, notably missing programming language tho haha. \n\nThere's no expectation that you have to have previous coding knowledge to be a major, you'll start off in intro where they'll teach you python, then you'll probably learn ~~JS~~ edit: looks like it's Java from all the responses haha next (cs majors, correct me here if I'm wrong). It does go pretty quickly past intro so I do recommend learning what you can on your own time (one of the things I should've done). \n\nAs to my thoughts on the dept, it's been great! They have hired a ton of new profs lately so I don't have opinions on them but the dept on a whole focuses on the reasoning behind coding choices more so than on learning the actual languages themselves. Lots of CS grads go on to software dev or admin positions, so you'll be well served here. \n\nAs to chem, never took a class in it haha",

CS is combined with a lot of majors, specifically ones where it can be used with research/data ingest/digest/validation.  But there are undoubtedly students out there who combine CS with their humanities majors",

I went in with absolutely no programming experience whatsoever, started with Intro CS my freshman spring, completed the major, and now I work as a software engineer at a competitive company! So clearly they did something right :)\n\nI didn't feel as though there was ever any pressure to have experience going in. Intro taught me Python like bust3ralex said, and then I learned Java next in Data Structures (this may have changed? I'm not certain); I learned C later on as well. It's also possible to dip in and out of the CS department without majoring and still end up working in the field\u2014I have a friend who doubled in math/english, took several CS classes, and also works as a software engineer now.\n\nI can't speak to the chemistry department quite as well, but I had multiple close friends who majored in chem and loved it. If you'd like, I could reach out to them with any questions you'd have, and I'd be happy to answer any followups about CS (or things in general) as well!\n\nCongratulations on your acceptance, especially in such a competitive year! Carleton is a fantastic school, and you'll have a great time there :)",

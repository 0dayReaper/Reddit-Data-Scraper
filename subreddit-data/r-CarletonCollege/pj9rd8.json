The one reason why I am hesitant about applying to Carleton is the fact that their CS department won't be as good as other big schools due to its size.\n\nI am aware that Carleton has one of the better CS programs for LACs, however I am still worried that an LAC education won't prepare me as well for industry and getting a job as another big school would.\n\nIf there are any Carleton CS alums here, could you talk about how well you think Carleton prepared you to be a programmer or worker in the tech industry? Do you regret your decision to come here rather than another big tech school?\n\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "Went to Carleton, didn't major in CS, but I have a bunch of friends who did. A good chunk got programming jobs pretty easily right out of the gate. A good chunk have gone into teaching, either as professors or high school teachers. But I think the LAC school thing prepares you really well for picking up new skills, which tends to be a plus in any industry, including being a software engineer.\n\nFull disclosure my dad teaches in the Carleton CS department, so I grew up with a ton of stories about all the various former students of his that are out working software jobs. One guy wrote the first iOS flight tracker app while in school at Carleton and sold it for a few million. A couple make video games (the interesting part, not QA). Just learned a Carleton alum programmed 90% of the Android version of Trello, which I've used for years at my own job. Others are at Facebook, Google, and all the other enormous and evil software companies out there.\n\ntl;dr Carleton will prepare you just fine for being a software engineer. If you know you want to do that, you can make sure you prioritize prepping for that while you're there. But like, college doesn't matter as much as you think it does for what career you have afterwards. As a highly-paid-software-engineer-non-Carl-but-still-liberal-arts-college-going-to friend recently told me, to get hired as a programmer, you basically just need to be able to do a certain checklist of things. Carleton, or any other school, or a 6 week bootcamp that you really pour your heart into, will teach you those things.",

Even though computer science, last time I checked, was one of the largest departments on campus, you'll still be getting way more individual attention there than at a larger university. Additionally, these are good times to make connections with your peers which may be easier in a small class compared to say a large lecture hall.\n\n&gt; I am still worried that an LAC education won't prepare me as well for industry and getting a job as another big school would.\n\nThink a prime selling point, one that gets driven down your throat a lot if you talk to liberal arts people, is that it's a well-rounded education that promote interdisciplinary work. At Carleton, you won't just be stuck in the computer science department. Instead, you'll have the ability to learn from other fields that will complement your overall education. This might sound like a downside if you just wanna sit at your computer and program all day though. For me, it's helped me a lot.\n\n&gt; If there are any Carleton CS alums here, could you talk about how well you think Carleton prepared you to be a programmer or worker in the tech industry?\n\nI graduated 2020 with a CS degree. I'm currently in graduate school though pursuing a computer science PhD. Although I didn't go into industry, I know a lot of my classmates went onto these well renowned tech. companies if that's what you're into: Google, Bloomberg, Epic (Systems, not Epic Games), Facebook, Microsoft, Target, Spotify to name a few.\n\nTo me, the liberal arts doesn't really hold you back. It especially doesn't hold you back once you have some definitive experience\u2014like an internship\u2014under your belt.\n\n&gt; Do you regret your decision to come here rather than another big tech school?\n\nI previously attended the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and I can say for sure that I'm glad that I came to Carleton and got the personalized education/support from faculty members that came to Carleton to *teach,* not to publish research.\n\nCarleton also does a really good job at preparing you for graduate school as well if that's something you want to do. We send a lot of people to good computer science graduate schools: University of Wisconsin - Madison, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign, University of California - San Diego just to name a few from my graduating class.\n\nHopefully that was helpful. Feel free to ask follow-up questions though.",

You're right about the lack of systems researchers at Carleton. If you are interested in that, I would apply to REUs at different schools during your summers. I think the letters you can get from the faculty will make your application strong. Knew a fair number of people who went this route.",

            "comment": "I majored in CS and ultimately ended up writing curriculum at Codecademy. Not exactly a developer role, but definitely in the tech industry. Lots of my CS major friends got software development jobs right out of college.\n\nCarleton's CS program is great, and I don't regret it at all. If you're really confident that you want to go into the tech industry, I would encourage you to find an internship at a tech company after your sophomore or junior year. I did research with profs during my summers and I feel like that put me in a good position to go into academia, but I felt a little behind in terms of going into the industry.",

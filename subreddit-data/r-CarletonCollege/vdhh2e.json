    "postText": "Hi, I'm a rising high school senior applying to colleges in the upcoming fall. I want to apply to liberal arts colleges because of their undergraduate focus and close-knit commmunities. I'm particularly interested in Carleton because it has a reputable computer science program among other liberal arts colleges. I want to ask a few questions about computer science at Carleton.\n\n1. What are the best computer science courses that you have taken in Carleton?\n2. For systems courses such as operating systems and database systems, are students asked to write low level code to actually implement the system?",

Same with computer networks with Amy Czimar Dalal but I didn't take much out of it practically. Overall, the faculty are great.\n\n&gt; 2. For systems courses such as operating systems and database systems, are students asked to write low level code to actually implement the system?\n\nI only took Computer Systems (CS 208) and only remember doing one MIPS assignment. In programming languages though you touch C when you build a Scheme interpreter.\n\nHaven't taken database systems or operating systems, they're electives/not necessary to graduate.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you got other questions.",

It's actually kinda a fun logic challenge. 2020 grad here. I know I'm late but feel free to ask more questions",

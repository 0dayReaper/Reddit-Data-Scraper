    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman at Carleton. I've been learning Italian on my own for a month or so now pretty intensively because I've always wanted to learn the language. I realize that Carleton doesn't offer Italian, so I can't continue this particular study at Carleton. I'm not sure what I should do. I know that there is an independent study option, but is that available to Freshman? I would like to set myself up to retain what I've already learned.\n\nCarleton is intensive I've heard, so I probably won't study Italian during the school year if I don't have a single period related to it. I'm learning Italian to interact with family, so I don't want to learn a different language.\n\nDo any of you know the answer to this, or know who I should email with these questions?",

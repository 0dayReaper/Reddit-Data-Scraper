This method costs a lot more than the taxi and it's fairly difficult to find a ride back to MSP this way. \n\nCurrent students also have the option of borrowing a friends car, getting a ride with someone, or using a campus car (as long as it's club- related, and probably not to MSP). I don't think you'd have those options as a prospie though",

I'm wondering how much this affects in admission into the school once that comes around and also wondering about your Carleton experience in general!",

But to give you some insight, the TOC program is historically more selective than the general admissions process. Being admitted to TOC is a pretty good sign that Carleton thinks you'll make a good Carl. \n\nAs to my experience, I ended up loving Carleton and it opened up so many doors that I wouldn't have otherwise had access to. Plus, I really made lifelong relationships. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

(Though of course no guarantee) It\u2019s a wonderful experience, though it will be different this year. When I attended it made me fall in love with the school and I haven\u2019t regretted it at all!",

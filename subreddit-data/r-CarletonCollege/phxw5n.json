    "postText": "1. I know that Carleton college likes applicants who are excited about interdisciplinary studies. If I'm the one who is passionate about one humanity field do I still have a chance for full scholarship?\n\n2. From the website I feel that the college community is pretty close-knit. Support, friendship, and engagement are respected. Did I get it right? What other exceptional things would you name about this college?",

Loving humanities is totally good and also we are a very community-focused college. I recommend you speak to currently Carleton students about Carleton so you can know what you like about it.",

I went long ago in the 90\u2019s and the financial aid was generous but there\u2019re no full rides. Work study was common. \n\nCarleton\u2019s community is terrific, with support for almost anything you could imagine.",

            "comment": "yes--a lot of the things that make carleton so fun/weird/quirky are things that are not really safe for admissions brochures. it's worth saying that traditions in general are the social cement of the school. other places build their identity with like sportsy school spirit--tailgating, football, or like greek life, but at Carleton, that bonding work comes from having a million different traditions.\n\nthere are a number of very long-standing traditions that are by and large ignored by the administration because they are too raucous or bizarre to be parent-approved. the cute ones like friday flowers or the silent dance party or Dacie Moses are all front and center, and it makes sense that they don't advertise some of the others, but the weirder traditions are what i found to be more relevant to my experience.\n\n1. like a prayer--this tradition began in the early 1990s with theater parties and has been a major feature of carleton parties since. at any major dance or party, at the stroke of midnight, you'll hear the opening notes of madonna singing \"life is a mystery...\" and everyone around you begins taking off their shirts to dance topless for the remainder of the song. this is very widespread and most people participate at least once in their four years, though it's by no means mandatory. people are pretty chill about it and there's not much peer pressure. i think most carls have lifelong association with that song\n2. paul giamatti half-mile wine tasting. this one is my personal favorite; it's maybe like 6 years old? it's inspired by the scene in sideways where paul giamatti runs through the vineyard drinking wine (and also partially by the scene where he pours the spit bucket of wine all over himself). once a term, people gather at the edge of the arb all dressed in white. each person brings a bottle of wine (or one to share). inside the arb is a short track, and the objective is to finish your bottle before you finish the track. sounds daunting but since it's a wine \"tasting,\" you end up spitting out a lot of it, mostly on other people (hence the white shirts). yes, it's a little gross, but i've never had so much fun looking so stupid. this one is super unofficial and the administration is not a fan of people running around drinking in the arb, so who knows how long it will last.\n3. something that i didn't even know was unusual until i met people who went to other schools was the degree to which event planning still happens over email rather than facebook, and the overall elaborate-ness of party themes. in four years, i was invited to a party via facebook maybe one or two times. (i graduated recently, so i'm not talking like 2007 here) the vast majority of invites happen over very elaborate email chains. in general, i would say that the party scene itself is very \\~quirky\\~, for lack of a better word. this is probably a function of being in such a rural location--people get very creative in making their own fun. farm house hosts friendship fest every year, where you get paired with a random person and do the 36 NYT questions to \"fall in love.\" other off the beaten path party themes i've heard about include: hats n' tats (to enter you must be wearing a hat and then get a temporary tattoo), there's an invite-only party for all the redheads on campus (so i hear), there was a holiday party where everyone had to coordinate and dress as a different holiday (arbor day, the old man and the baby for new years, etc), and the culinary club hosts a super popular food tour type party where each stop has prepared a different course to share. most majors also have their own distinct set of traditions and in general, most parties have multiple \"stops\" / hosts, which i think is part of how they get so elaborate.\n4. the wedding--in spring term each year students host a mock wedding. people go all out for this one, and it's really a spectacle above all else. one of my most vivid memories at carleton was sitting in the chapel with several hundred other students at like 10 pm on a thursday to watch this. the officiant had just gotten an online certification, the bride walked down the aisle holding a raw head of broccoli, which she nibbled on during the \"ceremony.\" someone was playing bagpipes. not sure where tradition came from, but it's definitely worth seeing\n5. [LNT (late night trivia)](https://apps.carleton.edu/student/orgs/latenighttrivia/)\\--this one is pretty old, at least from the 90s. it's basically just a very elaborate trivia game/ scavenge hunt that happens every winter before finals. \"the gods\" spend a term planning this out, and it's super competitive. a lot of people are too stressed with finals to do it, but there's a very active subset of people who are extremely into this.\n6. the CLAP--carleton literary association publication. the least classy and most read publication at carleton. they'll print anything any student submits as long as a name is attached to it. comes out every friday during convo time and is a major venue for campus drama/discussion. on any given week, its mostly memes or inside jokes, but every so often there is a really newsworthy submission or argument/debate in it, so it's always worth reading. i had heard literally nothing about this as a prospie, but it's definitely a feature of life\n7. streaking. i was totally surprised by how much streaking there is on campus. major events like rotblatt, synchrony II, and NSW are usually streaked. carleton also has the distinction of having the first known/recorded female streaker on a college campus in the early 70s. this is not like a super widespread phenomenon and i think its a small percentage of people who do it, but it's not infrequent.\n8. saturday sundaes. this one is wholesome. every saturday evening the dining halls offer a bunch of different ice cream flavors and toppings. i still crave ice cream every saturday night from force of habit. in general, the dining halls have a lot of traditions that are p consistent--may 4th is always star wars themed food day (may the fourth be with you), and stuff like that.\n9. another small but endearing thing is that the librarians name all the staplers in the library. there is one prominently placed stapler and it obviously gets a lot of wear and tear, so they have a tradition where when a stapler dies, they make the new one a short bio and write it's name on the side in gel pen. they usually go alphabetically through the year, so you can tell how many staplers we've gone through based on it's name. on halloween, they sometimes make a stapler graveyard of all the broken ones.\n\noops, i didn't mean to write a wall of text, but there are honestly a ton of traditions (and more that i've probably forgotten). this is the thing that i loved most about carleton: the sense of humor and willingness to be goofy. as a high schooler, some of these might have freaked me out if i had known about them in advance, but overall i'm really glad i got to be part of them. people are generally fun and creative and like to have fun in creative ways. feel free to dm me if you have any questions",

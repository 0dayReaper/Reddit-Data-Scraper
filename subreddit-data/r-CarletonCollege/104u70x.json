Admissions likely doesn't release this information if you can't find it on the internet. You can try searching \"Carleton common data set\" to see if there's anything there from previous years but I'm not sure. \n\nI can say it does happen for students who are deferred in ED1/2 to be accepted in RD (one of my good friends got in that way). \n\nSpecifically for int'l students, though, I'm not sure - sorry",

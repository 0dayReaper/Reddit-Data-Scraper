I\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t have to worry about finances to ed but I have never actually been to Carleton. Could anyone tell me whats special about Carleton that can\u2019t be found on it\u2019s website or in a virtual info session (all colleges sound the same over zoom). Also, do you think it\u2019s a good idea to ed to Carleton if I\u2019ve never been to Minnesota?",

            "comment": "I honestly think one of the best things about Carleton is it's small-town Minnesota location. I'll elaborate. Other SLACS like Swarthmore or Pomona have factors external to the school culture itself that draw students, like weather or proximity to a large city that encourage people to apply. (In cases like Amherst or Williams, it may be name recognition.) So people who end up there may be there for reasons other than loving the school. Not many people are like \"wow i want to be somewhere really cold and rural,\" so my theory is that people who end up at Carleton are generally really jazzed about being at Carleton specifically for the school itself and bring that positivity and enthusiasm. Most people are invested in being part of the community. I was worried about being on a rural campus, but it's being so removed from a city and distractions like clubs or bars etc that causes people to create their own fun and get to know each other rather than go out every weekend.  hence the many \\~\\~quirky\\~\\~ traditions.\n\nAlso, I had no idea as a non-native Midwesterner just how friendly people are here in Minnesota--it's real and I think that permeates the whole school. It's easier to come out of your shell when everyone around you (staff, students, faculty) is exceptionally friendly. I remember as I toured Carleton being shocked by how many random students came up to our group as we walked around, either greeting the tour guide or telling us things they liked about the school, or just shouting \"come to carleton!\" that didn't happen on any of my other tours. I came to Carleton *despite* it being in MN, but quickly realized that its a huge part of what makes it such a wonderful environment and have stayed after. \n\nas others have said, the academics are challenging because of the trimester system, but people are not at all competitive. in all my time there i never heard people comparing grades, it was definitely taboo. i felt so comfortable asking questions and learning from my peers because it felt like a given that we were all intelligent and it didn't feel like i had to prove how smart i was, i could just focus on learning. being surrounded by people who were genuinely interested in the material beyond getting a good grade and curious about the world but not pretentious or condescending about it is something i miss about being on campus. people are smart and work hard but are willing to laugh at themselves and be goofy too. it's been much harder for me to find people like that after carleton.",

I totally agree with what you say about people being attracted to some schools because of location but people going to Carleton because of the school. On that note, are their any students who feel isolated in Carleton or \u201csuffocated\u201d ( that\u2019s 1 complaint I heard from someone who goes to a SLAC)",

            "comment": "I won't claim that any of these experiences will be unique to Carleton specifically, but I think going to a SLAC really helped cultivate them.\n\nFor one, I agree with the others about making friends that will last. I'm only a year out from undergrad and I can't imagine life without them. And with the ability to get individual attention more easily at a small school, I think I left with strong faculty relationships too which have helped me during the graduate application process.\n\nI also thought the non-competitive academic vibe was really nice at Carleton. As someone who's very focused on academics, having others to remind me that life isn't all about school and grades was good for my mental health.\n\nI also felt like I got to explore many things at Carleton that I wouldn't have in a bigger school. I know you're looking at SLACs which is good, so you'll experience it regardless of where you go I'm sure.\n\nYou're in a rough spot with deciding between schools during these times. I'm sure you'll still make the right choice though no matter which school. You know yourself best. Feel free to let me know if you had any more questions!",

It's nice to just go down there and grab bagels or coffee in the morning. Or just stroll around the town.\n\nOne thing I've had to get used to outside of Carleton is not leaving my stuff around. At Carleton I would just leave my shit around in public places and it doesn't get stolen. It's weird having to worry about that now cause I've been so used to it at Carleton. Guess that says something about the environment.\n\nAlso you're guaranteed work study if you qualify for it which is super nice if you need that extra financial aid.\n\nI don't think you'll regret doing early decision at Carleton, but I'm a little bias obviously. I certainty don't regret anything about going to Carleton.",

Carleton has a community that isn't competitive at all and the students here are extremely supportive of one another and genuinely care about how you and their friends are doing. \n\nOn top of that, the friends you'll make will undoubtedly extend to professors and staff. A lot of students leave Carleton with as many students friends as staff/faculty friends (okay, maybe not *as many* but a good amount) \n\nHope this helps and let me know if u have other questions!",

There is a saying, spoken during the first convocation, \"From this day forward, you're a part of Carleton, and Carleton is a part of you.\"  I know it sounds cheesy, but it is also true.\n\nThis is reflected in the generous financial support by alumni of Carleton.  So what is different, well, I would say that there is guided freedom.  If you want to pursue an idea, you will have the support and direction from very intelligent people to help you do that.\n\nWhen I first went to visit Carleton, I went because I was visiting St. Olaf.  The buildings and structure of Carleton was very appealing, so visit in the fall.  I was not from MN, but did not regret doing early decision.",

    "postText": "Heyy everyone! International applicant here, hoping to get some insights on making my final decision - Duke vs Carleton vs UIUC!\n\nBio major, I'm considering med school later but not sure yet. Number one priority is to be happy in college - have a really enjoyable 4 years, make good friends and also find myself and become more confident. So a Type-A environment would be an absolute deal-breaker for me. I'd also like a thriving student life, with enough fun clubs/activities etc outside class. Thankfully, neither cost nor location is a factor..\n\nAtm, pros and cons look like\n\nDuke: Pros\n\n\\- Down to earth culture\n\n\\- name/prestige\n\n\\-great for Bio\n\nCons:\n\n\\-I'm worried about the possible Type-A, pre-professional culture\n\n\\- I'm not too keen on Greek life and parties, so dk if this would exclude me from the social scene\n\n\\-I saw a few posts where people didn't seem too happy about Duke (had a below average experience till 3rd/4th year, these were definitely not the best 4 years of my life etc etc)\n\nCarleton : Pros\n\n\\-very warm, happy community\n\n\\-would tick the \"finding myself\" criterion\n\nCons:\n\n\\-liberal arts may mean I have to do a Master's/PhD/med school after, don't want to commit to this yet :P\n\n\\-liberal arts doesn't work for everyone, and I'm worried that if this is the case for me, I may have to go through the whole process of transferring etc\n\nUIUC - Pros:\n\n\\-CHILL culture, their subreddit is hilarious, people seem laidback, love the energy and vibes\n\nCons:\n\n\\-not the same \"name\" that a Duke or Carleton has + Bio's not one of the main majors (unlike a CS or engineering)\n\n\\-I may feel lost in the big university, big class sizes etc\n\nThanks a bunch, I'd really appreciate your inputs!",

            "comment": "You are considering three very different schools. The right one for you will be mostly about what your goals and desires are.\n\nI don\u2019t know a lot of the cultures of the other schools other than to say that Greek life can be very dominant at bigger schools. Sounds like this is not a pro for you.\n\nIf you want to be a doctor, go into medical science, or be a biological researcher you will need a PhD or at least a master\u2019s regardless, even if you got a Bio BS from Duke. I would expect both Duke and Carleton to prepare you well for grad school and to be a BA that opens doors at grad programs.\n\nNote that Carleton being a liberal arts school that confers BAs rather than BSes by no means makes it less rigorous or respected. In fact, I have heard from a number of authorities that med schools love seeing applicants from liberal arts schools because it means these candidates are more well rounded and are more likely to have the people skills that the medical profession often lacks. It\u2019s not even critical to major in Bio \u2014 I have a friend who graduated from Carleton with a studio art major, but who took a ton of bio, math, and other science courses\u2026 and got accepted to Stanford med school.\n\nOne big academic experience difference I would expect to find between Duke and Carleton is the quality, availability, and direct attention from profs. At an R1 like Duke the profs\u2019 priorities are, in order, 1. their research, 2. their grad students\u2019 research, 3. their grad teaching, 4. their undergrad teaching. In many classes at R1 schools, faculty develop the syllabus and deliver lectures, but the actual direct instruction and help is often via a grad student TA. Whereas at a liberal arts school like Carleton the faculty priorities are 1. undergrad teaching, 2. their own research (which often involves undergrads). The difference in your experience is huge in terms of faculty contact.",

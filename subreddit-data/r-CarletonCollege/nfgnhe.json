Olaf\u2019s music program is much stronger than Carleton\u2019s, and I think they are happy with their choice. It\u2019s not common, but if it\u2019s the right choice for that student I\u2019ve never heard of any sort of unspoken rules against it.",

Ultimately, I chose St. Olaf due to their stronger majors. U mind if I ask why you plan on transferring out of St. Olaf? (At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing)",

I\u2019m also an incoming student and they want me to get my grades up and transfer to somewhere higher ranked. I kinda love the small town vibes that people keep describing so I was hoping to stay in Northfield if I do end up transferring and it\u2019s kinda hard for me to say no... they keep going on about yanking my tuition money if I don\u2019t do well and go somewhere else better and so on",

If money is a big leverage for your parents bossing you around, I can def help you appeal your aid. St. Olaf is notoriously known for their ridiculously large financial aids. And one big thing I\u2019d like to add, St. Olaf and Carleton are literally the same schools. Let me ask you something, you know why there are so many different varying ranks for schools everywhere on the internet? It\u2019s because none of them are \u201cofficial.\u201d I\u2019ve found countless website that declare St. Olaf the #1 school in Minnesota while others claim Carleton to be first. Rank does not matter, what matters is that you try your god damn hardest. You fucking got this man, don\u2019t allow your parents to make decisions for you.\n\nI got a few friends who are also going into St. Olaf this year, if you wanna make some friends before you commit, DM me.",

From 30k to 27.5k EFC, it\u2019s great but I don\u2019t really think that my parents\u2019 leverage over my head is going away anytime soon. I have money saved up but nowhere enough to fill the 110k gap for all 4 years. But thank you so much for offering, I\u2019m really grateful for it. My parents go by the US News and Forbes ranking and that\u2019s all they really care about so I don\u2019t really know how to change their opinion on St Olaf...\n\nOn a side note we might already know each other, I\u2019m in the discord, the Facebook group and I follow the Instagram page and as you know this is quite a sensitive topic thus the anonymity is required....",

But, I think your parents don\u2019t quite realize how difficult transferring is (to \u201cbetter\u201d schools that is) So, in case you have any courage to argue with your parents any longer, allow me to give you some of my arguments. \n\n1. Trying to get name recognition as an intl student outside of US is impossible if you\u2019re not going to an Ivy league. Take Colgate College for example. An amazing school right? Prestigious as hell too (7% acc rate I believe) when I told my Korean buddies abt applying there, they literally laughed there ass off and said ISNT THAT THE TOOTHPASTE LMAOOO. Name recognition is nothing if you\u2019re not going to Harvard.\n\n2. \u201cIF name recognition is something I can\u2019t get, what should I be looking for?\u201d I\u2019m glad you asked. Internships!!!!!! Imagine the scenarios: Do you think itll be easier for you to get internships in a school filled with tryhards and people with 4.0 GPAs, or do u think itll be easier in a small and closely connected school like St. Olaf? \n\n3. Community College vs a private undergrad school, which institution do u think has a higher transfer success rate? WRONG IT\u2019S COMMUNITY COLLEGE. Schools like Penn State often have connections with their nearby CCs and have a program designed solely for students wanting to transfer. What your parents want from you will literally be harder than you trying to get into Carleton normally. \n\nYou. Made. The. Right. Decision. You fucking got this, I fucking believe in you. Go tell your parents it\u2019s your future. Feel free to talk to me on discord, I\u2019m in the serve with the name hArRy",

More variables that\u2019ll decide a hit or miss....",

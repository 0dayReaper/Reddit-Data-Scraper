I\u2019d honestly be very surprised if you didn\u2019t get in. As for ED2 vs RD, ED2 definitely gives you a better shot, but with your credentials I\u2019d go for RD just cause then you won\u2019t have to lock yourself to just Carleton. Excited to see you on campus! (Well technically I\u2019ll be gone by then by still can\u2019t wait for you to be on campus!)",

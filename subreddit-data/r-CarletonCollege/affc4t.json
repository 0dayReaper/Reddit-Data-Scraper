This is your chance to either hit home with a few points you've made throughout our app or to give some insight into the things you care about but didn't make it on the application. These questions don't count for much, and I'd guess they're just there to break up the monotony of reading thousands of applications. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDM me (I'm a current junior) if you have any more questions about Carleton!

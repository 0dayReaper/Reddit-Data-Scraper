    "postText": "Hello! I'm a prospective International student from Asia. \n\nMy family's ability to pay is very limited. Is an estimated EFC of $2500 very low to be considered for admission? (As an International) I'm gonna apply for RD.\nAre there current international students who had EFC as low as mine? (If you don't mind sharing)\n\nI have taken 3 SAT subject tests (Math 2 - 800, Chemistry - 800, Physics - 770). How much may it help in the admission process? \n\nIt will be really helpful if someone can give me some Insights. And please feel free to drop any additional suggestions about admission as an International. (Especially the essay!!)",

            "comment": "Financial aid is not tied to academics at all, at least for domestic students, which may be different for international students but I\u2019m not sure. I do know that several international students get full rides/very good financial aid, but the admissions office is where you should go to ask more questions about what you\u2019d be eligible for. I\u2019m a domestic student, but I\u2019d say with the essay just be genuine and make it so people can learn about who you are as a person. Don\u2019t think of it like selling yourself, but rather describing yourself and your life to a new friend you just met",

I would recommend to mainly focus for ED with that EFC, since you have to show that you\u2019re really Committed, and maybe you should consider local options more. \n\nCollege essay guy has a cool paragraph on that topic, please check it out\n\nhttps://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/financial-aid-international-students",

                            "comment": "btw, some colleges have special quotas on full ride for Students from particular region. For example, Richmond college gives full ride to one student from Kazakhstan each year. If this student devotes from scholarship, then they offer to the second best. My friend showed all commitment to Richmond, to qualify for that Quota. I dont know if Universities post this info on their websites, but it\u2019s definitely a thing for at least a couple Colleges I know of. You should find this quotas for your country, and maybe commit to them",

            "comment": "Carleton has a certain number (limited, but still) of financial aid packages for international students. As other have said, talking with the financial aid office is the right move. But I know for sure that there are international students at Carleton who receive substantial financial aid.\n\nIn general the way the Admissions process works at Carleton is that they accept students from the \u201ctop\u201d without considering financial need, then look at each already-accepted student\u2019s need and deduct from their budget as they go. Only once they run out of financial aid dollars do they start using financial need as a criterion. So at least theoretically, two students who both have financial need should be on even admissions footing regardless of how much need exists. That said, I am more familiar with the domestic admissions process, that may not exactly describe how things work for international applicants.\n\nYou might also reach out to the Office of International Student Life: https://www.carleton.edu/international/",

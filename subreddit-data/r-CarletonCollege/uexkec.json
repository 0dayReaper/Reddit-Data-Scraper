I just read the article up there ^ and it kind of worried me about my college decision, I was really really intent on Carleton until I read this article. I just wanna know what y\u2019all think? I\u2019m from a pretty conservative place but by law of random assortment I\u2019ve run into a couple gay guys, who (as closeted as they may be) were much better then no gay guys. \n\nSo I\u2019m really hoping y\u2019all can bring some light to this and share what you\u2019ve experienced related to this topic\u2026. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit confusing I\u2019m two tired for drafts right now \ud83d\ude01",

I've only interacted with their programming and community as an alum, because I had no idea I was queer while I was a student. (This was not due to a lack of queer rep on campus, though I don't doubt the percentages quoted in that article, but rather because I'm aroace and compulsory hetero-amato/allonormativity is a hellava drug.) They might be able to shine more light on your question.",

Maybe the GSC can put you in touch with a current student or recent alum who might be a good ambassador for discussing the queer experience on campus. I can remember (back in my day... of the early 2000s...) that there were definitely openly gay students on campus. Most of the queer people I knew personally were actually in pretty healthy relationships. But as an ace person, I can't speak to the hookup culture that the article you linked references. Sorry!\n\nFor what it's worth, the few trans alums I know didn't come out or begin their transition until after graduation. I don't know how much that has changed (as I said, it's been a.... few... years). It was definitely far more \"acceptable\" to be openly gay rather than any other form of queer. I do hope that has changed.",

            "comment": "Having read the article, one thing I can say is that the concerns the author raises about dating online were true for both straight and gay preferences in my experience. In the era of Covid, you might expect people to turn to apps, but less than a day of swiping can exhaust the students at Carleton and St. Olaf regardless of your preferences. \n\nI'm a bisexual male currently attending Carelton, and though the dating scene in general has left a bit to be desired, the article makes a fantastic point when it speaks on how college students in general overestimate the amount of sex their peers are having. \n\nWhat I can say is that there's no stigma around being gay here, or if there is one, its certainly quite hidden. To reference what the other commenter has mentioned, I can't speak on the Trans or GNC experience myself as it's not an experience I've lived, but I wouldn't describe it from an outsider perspective as being hugely different from the gay experience in terms of acceptability. There are quite a few openly Trans and NB students on campus, and I'm (thankfully) not aware of anyone who would openly deride them for their gender identity. \n\nEssentially, if you're questioning coming to Carelton, don't decide against because you're concerned about stigmas against gay men. If you're looking for a thriving dating scene that'll be the complete opposite of a rather anti-gay high-school experience though, Carleton's dating scene might not be the best option, and a larger school might serve you better. Feel free to DM me if you've got any more questions.",

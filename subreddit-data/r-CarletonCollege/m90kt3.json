    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI recently got accepted into Carleton and am SO thrilled since it's one of my top choices!!! I'm currently interested in majoring in cognitive science, doing the special major thing in Japanese, and then being on the Pre-Med track. \n\nKnowing that Carleton is in a rural area, I was wondering about the different types of research and internship opportunities that Pre-Med students have access to or can apply to. Could a current student or an alumni just give me a rundown about them? \n\nThank you so much!!!",

Caveat: I wasn't pre-med and I didn't do research/internships in that field but a large portion of my friends were pre-med and I'll rip from them a bit. \n\nFirst off, congratulations on getting into Carleton!  You're right that Carleton is in a fairly rural area (Northfield has a population of 20,007). But there are still a lot of internships / pre-med opportunities in the surrounding areas or, more common, in the twin cities which are a 45 minute ride away.  The Mayo Clinic comes to mind but also don't overlook the plentiful research opportunities on campus with professors too (there are so, so many research labs at Carleton). \n\nHopefully someone with some more first-hand experience can jump in but that's what I know from my friends",

            "comment": "Howdy! Congrats on your acceptance into Carleton! \n\nThere are sooo many opportunities for research and internships that relate to the Pre-Med field, both at Carleton and off-campus. I know several students that secured summer internships through the NIH and medical centers for research related to biology, chemistry, and cognitive science. If you identify as someone who is underrepresented in STEM, then I would highly recommend that you take a look at Carleton\u2019s [FOCUS Program](https://www.carleton.edu/focus/) as it is specifically designed to support students in STEM majors, including the Pre-Med track.\n\nOverall, Carleton\u2019s physical location will not get in the way of your pursuit of research and internship opportunities in your field. I hope this helps, and best wishes on your college acceptance journey!",

            "comment": "I do not have direct information - BUT I imagine there will be opportunities if you seek such - if you are looking to do some hands-on work in a wet-lab/experiments it may be harder locally - but I would not rule that out - ask around - I am sure there will be people who will try and help.  If it is computational, theoretical (i.e. without wet-lab) I am sure you can also find opportunities - see if you can identify areas you think you may be interested in - talk to people on campus, elsewhere.  \n\nPre-med you say?  If so, (and this is somewhat biased, I'll admit) - examine some area related to genetics/genomics - yes, you will learn the usual in class and perhaps even in medschool - but few physicians are trained in OR appear to be interested in how genetics/genomics impacts healthcare, health.  Being able to sequence the human genome is but the beginning of a very long journey that could benefit from physicians spending time with genetics/genomics - since I imagine we will see people walking into their physician's office with a thumb drive of their sequence(s) or genotype or some such - and the physician can then tailor his/her advice (!) (OK, I know I am dreaming - but it is happening - just not sure precisely when !)",

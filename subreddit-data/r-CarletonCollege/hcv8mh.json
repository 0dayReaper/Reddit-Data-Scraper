I've enjoyed my experience and have made a lot of good friends here. Carleton has also prepared me immensely for graduate school because I got the opportunities to work with professors in the departments. I hope you find good times ahead despite these uncertain times.",

            "comment": "\u201817 graduate, will try and give you a balanced perspective on things. I\u2019m sure I will ramble so apologies in advance - I\u2019ll remember to tldr at the end. Brief background: I was a male political science major, did not have any one activity like a varsity sport that I spent a lot of my time doing, curious but also a big time procrastinator/not your straight As Fulbright scholar type of person.  \n\nFirst of all, I think it can\u2019t be stressed just how great the academics and professors are. Frankly, it\u2019d be unfair of me to talk about my experience without mentioning just how good this aspect of Carleton is. 90% of the classes available here are hugely educational, superbly taught and intellectually stimulating. Personally, I was a political science major but as someone keen to \u201cexplore\u201d and decidedly not a specialist, I took a little of everything (outside of some STEM departments like physics, chem, and bio - which by all accounts are as strong or stronger than other departments at the college- and some smaller departments like women and gender studies or Ed studies). For anyone who is curious and interested in growing their base of knowledge across subject areas, I strongly believe Carleton is a fantastic environment and one that equips students to do this superbly. 1) You will have the chance to develop relationships and get to know pretty much all your professors, most of whom are great people and very good at what they do 2) you will have access to a fantastic library/plethora of other resources to help you juice the most out of your experience, and 3) the facilities and resource that support academic departments right from stuff like physics to stuff like cinema studies are superb and mostly state of the art. \n\nNow for the second part of the equation, and probably the more important part: the actual life and experience! So the flipside of the whole kid in a candy shop Carleton academic experience is the fact that it\u2019s also pretty fucking hectic, considering it\u2019s on a trimester schedule, professors have high expectations, and for the most part we don\u2019t have grade inflation/probably have grade deflation (though it varies dept to dept and prof to prof). Personally, to be really honest, this often rekt me because I am a diagnosed ADHD kid who procrastinates a lot and didn\u2019t have very good time management skills. It also rekt a lot of the people I knew, though they may have ended up with better grades because they worked harder/had better coping skills/were smarter than me. But the point is it still takes a mental toll on you and I think this is a pretty serious problem for Carleton as a culture. That said, I also had plenty of friends who didn\u2019t end up getting \u201crekt\u201d and actually managed their academic loads in mostly smart ways. So really the point of my writing all this is not that you\u2019re doomed to ruin your physical and mental health studying and worrying about your classes but rather that have some perspective on the importance of grades, dont take hard classes all the time unless you genuinely want to, and learn to manage your time well from day 1 because IMO it\u2019s quite critical to having a good Carleton experience. \n\nAnother thing I want to say is that while academic curiosity and the ability to satisfy that curiosity in every imaginable way is a wonderful thing, I also do feel that I and a lot of my peers lost perspective on what we really wanted out of life while here. In many ways, this is part of the experience of (and in my opinion the problem with) attending college, especially a LAC, but I feel like owing to whatever cultural currents and circumstances, many Carls including myself chased different highs through college, most of which I now find don\u2019t end up adding anything to your life. This is going to be different things for different people - some got obsessed with grades and academic culture, others with fitting into some set social group and going hard every weekend - personally, I spent way too much time getting baked and \u201cchilling\u201d/doing a bunch of hippy shit lol. I guess my wider point here is just that I don\u2019t think the college, and more generally college, does a good job training you for the actual challenges of life. Or put another way, I don\u2019t think the priorities of most students were necessarily the best. If I were to do Carleton over again, I would really put a premium on my health and fitness and give more time to thinking about what I actually wanted to do with my life. I think many of my peers would echo my sentiment that the culture here tends to slot you into a few different life tracks with presumed desirable end results. 90% of your peers are either loosely aiming for academia, a professional career like a doctor or lawyer, public service, or a \u201cprestigious\u201d white collar job like a management consultant, banker, or maybe a product manager at a tech company. Now there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with any of these careers but my point is just that one is not encouraged to think beyond these boxes, which I think can be quite stifling once you actually graduate and realize maybe youre not happiest doing one of these things. So I think breaking that groupthink and thinking for yourself and prioritizing your own wants and needs in life is something I think is very critical to getting a good experience out of the college. \n\nFinally, a little about the social life and general student experience. There are a few great things about Carleton life and a few not so great things imo. The best parts I think are that the campus is fucking amazing and you have access to an awesome forest (the arb) that you can walk to within 5 minutes. You also have access to a p decent rec center, a state of the art music and media facility, and lots of little little awesome places like the observatory. It\u2019s a beautiful campus and you will definitely come to love it. Beyond that, Northfield is a decentish small Town with a few good breweries and restaurants. The cities are less than an hour away by bus or car and personally I enjoyed visiting them a lot though I understand recent events possibly change just how much one would want to visit them. \n\nThe students for the most part are kind and intelligent, though a bit awkward but that\u2019s just the Carleton brand lol. The problem is I think being on such a small campus does cause Carls to live in a bubble, especially since there is not really a wider city to escape to. Already referred to it in part earlier re: careers but also generally speaking, people here I think have their reality moulded too significantly by whatever is happening within the college community at that moment. Unlike a larger school, there are few enough kids where you\u2019re going to know mostly everyone by face if not name and anything even remotely controversial that happens kind of gets broadcast throughout the community. I also feel like we end up with a mentality of intellectual or moral superiority to \u201cnormal people\u201d which I think is a really harmful mindset to get into. I also feel there is a significant element of cliquishness in the culture - be it related to sports teams, cultural orgs or whatever other organization. Of course, most kids make friends across groups and cultures which is a definite positive about Carleton but it does feel sometimes like you need to identify with a sub culture to \u201cfit in\u201d just because there\u2019s only so many people attending lol. Finally, I do feel the political atmosphere on campus is quite poor. The discourse is dominated by a loud minority of progressive/radical students. What ends up happening is most people will either regurgitate the socially acceptable consensus opinions or not put their points across at all. Fortunately, I think most of the faculty here do not encourage that mindset in their classes. I\u2019ve known people with rather heterodox opinions who have always thrived in the classroom or in discussions with professors.\n\nAnd once again, that\u2019s really where Carleton shines. So here\u2019s the TL;DR: It\u2019s a beautiful campus with top notch facilities that is populated by intelligent, kind people, whether they are faculty, students, or stuff. I don\u2019t think you will ever complain of subpar facilities (other than the food lol) or a lack of intellectual stimulation here. However, it\u2019s also one heck of a bubble - a few thousand bright kids doing rigorous academics in semi isolation in rural Minnesota. Ultimately, it\u2019s what you make of it. If you keep your priorities straight, don\u2019t get too carried away with college BS, and just focus on learning and growing, it can be a really fantastic experience. Good luck!",

One thing to understand is that not every school works for everyone and that's okay!  \n\nI personally absolutely loved Carleton. I wasn't strictly here for the academics, more for the opportunity to work on what I wanted to work on (and to explore and find out what that was). My favorite aspect of Carleton is the laid-back, supportive environment. My friends genuinely care for my interests and are happy I'm doing what I like to do (which is to take pictures and to game haha). And I'm happy for my friends and their work too. It's definitely not competitive here at all. I've also found great support from faculty but even more so the staff. \n\nNow there are downsides to Carleton too, some ResLife policies baffle me to no extent and the summers here are pretty bad (I've stayed on campus every summer to work). \n\nBut overall, I'd definitely do it again, 10/10!",

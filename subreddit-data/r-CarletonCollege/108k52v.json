            "comment": "Carleton grad here- the general spirit of Carleton traditions are silly taken to another level. We have a giant bust (statue head) that we chase each other for around campus- like a game of tag but with a bulky Schiller bust. The \u201cprimal scream\u201d is a collective scream around campus during finals. Rotblatt, a game of softball where you have to have a drink in your hand to bat in a game of as many innings as the college is old. Every Friday the local flower shop comes to the student common space to sell single flowers that students buy for each other and leave along with little notes in each others mailboxes (Friday Flowers- like a valentines day every Friday). And many many more.\n\nSo, if you break it down- find a silly thing that you think would be 20 times funnier or sweeter if 600 20something year olds did it.",

Give Carleton the chance to get to know you as a person- be personal, vulnerable, and open. Remember: this isn\u2019t like the SAT where you\u2019re getting an objective score. Your supplements are being read by real people- connect with them.\n\nEdit to add: recent Carleton grad accepted ED I",

I have a few questions about Carleton. \n\nI'd like to be a premed. I know Carleton premeds get into fantastic schools every year, but does anyone have any insight on it overall? I heard Carleton has somewhat of a stress culture. Is that true?\n\nHow are politics on campus?  Are students mostly respectful of each other?  Is it easy to avoid politics if I want?",

            "comment": "Hmmm I might not completely understand what you\u2019re asking, but I wouldn\u2019t agree that there is a stress culture at Carleton. At least not in my personal experience as one of those premeds you referenced. It is true that there will be weekends or the occasional week where you will have to grind and might have to stay in the libe instead of going to a party but that\u2019s going to happen to all premeds at some point regardless of where they go to school. It is also true that we used to celebrate friends who would procrastinate until the last minute and then pull an all-nighter finishing a paper or studying for an exam. Naturally some terms will be harder with double labs and other terms will be pretty relaxed. But after swapping undergrad stories with my friends and coworkers, their undergraduate experiences seemed much more stressful and way less fun. I didn\u2019t realize how special and unique our experience at Carleton was until I graduated. Did that answer your question?\n\nRe: politics, yeah it\u2019s very left leaning. My friend group was actually surprisingly politically diverse, but none of us were involved at all in any political orgs, instead just casually debating each other over shitty beer on a Tuesday night.\n\nEdit: Congratulations on your acceptance",

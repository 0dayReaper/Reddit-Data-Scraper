    "postText": "I\u2019m an admitted student working very hard to decide between Olaf and Carleton. I\u2019m curious about your opinion on the academic differences between the two. Obviously Carleton has a stronger reputation overall. Is this deserved? What programs, if any, are stronger at St. Olaf? What school would you say leans more toward STEM? Thanks Carls!!",

            "comment": "I know music and math and teaching (the last of which isn\u2019t offered at Carleton in the same way) are all considered very strong at Olaf. Honestly, from my perception it is night and day. Carleton is well deserved in being ranked at the top of undergraduate teaching, and I think our academics are more engaging, more rigorous, and set you up a lot better for the future than Olaf does",

            "comment": "From what I can gather, Carleton is the stronger STEM school. Olaf\u2019s music program is stronger, but it\u2019s a conservatory which some people don\u2019t like. As a current Carleton student who has friends at Olaf, people at Carleton are much more satisfied than Oles (but also this is just anecdotal). \n\nTbh I think the more important question is where you\u2019ll feel comfortable socially, because you\u2019re a student for sure but you also need to pick a place that you will enjoy living. I\u2019d suggest trying to do a student hosting session with Carleton and Olaf as well as check the websites of departments that you\u2019re interested in.",

I've had many friends go to both schools, and parents of friends (and my own parents) who've taught at both schools.\n\nOlaf and Carleton are both very good schools. Olaf beats out of Carleton at music. Carleton beats out Olaf at essentially everything else, including STEM. I'd say Carleton especially outclasses Olaf at Math, CS, and physics. It's a bit closer on others.\n\nI think the advice from m7star2000 to think about the social aspect is pretty good, but both schools are big enough that you'll find people you like at either one. Student housing sessions can also be a bit luck-of-the-draw on who you get placed with. Overall my experience was that Carleton students tend to study harder, for better and worse. But you'll find plenty of people getting up to all sorts of stuff on both campuses.\n\nFrom the little info you gave, it sounds like Carleton is more likely the school for you IMO, but in the end, they're both great schools. You should feel good about either choice you make.",

            "comment": "Olaf is far superior with education and music, and also has a good nursing program. The art department seems more accessible. Both schools have huge numbers of generating peace corps/med school/grad school people. Profs who have taught at both schools say that Carleton students are more aggressive/involved in class discussion, Olaf students tend to be more gentle and polite and a bit harder to draw out. Carleton tends to be more up-in-their-heads academic, Olaf tends to be a bit more well-rounded. Carleton campus has a huge arboretum for wandering. But honestly you can\u2019t go wrong. I would visit and see where you feel most comfortable, and if you can\u2019t, call admissions and get them to hook you up with some students to talk to.",

Trust me, a bunch of college students living away from their parents for the first time, cooked up in a dorm when it's -20 degrees, tend to make their own fun. The Cave was almost always a blast. Sayles dances were lame (imho). When you're old enough, there are those funny bars in town. \n\nOh yeah there are the insane amounts of work I had to do for classes, but one more round of beer pong never hurt anyone. ",

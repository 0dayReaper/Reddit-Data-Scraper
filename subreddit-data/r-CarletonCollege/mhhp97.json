    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI have a few questions about double majoring here at Carleton. For context, I am a newly admitted student considering a double major in either physics and math, or physics and computer science, or simply a single major in physics. \n\nFor those of you who double major, what was your experience like with regards to scheduling and the majors? Did you feel like you had time to investigate both majors extensively? What did comps look like for you? \n\nFor those of you who did STEM or STEM double majors, do you feel like the majors are already too rigorous for a double major to be in the question? How many of you instead opted for the 3-2 experience for both physics and engineering, and what was that experience like?",

            "comment": "Heyo, 2018 physics grad here. The double major with math is pretty straightforward and somewhat common in the department. With all the math class prerequisites for physics classes, you get halfway to the math major without even trying. Cant speak to the difficulty of double compsing. I'm not saying it's easy, but it is done. The crossover with CS was much less prominent when I was there, doubt its changed much. \n\nOverall, ths physics degree was very rewarding, loved the staff, would highly recommend if you're interested",

Some of my peers are still in grad programs for Physics PhDs (other fields too, including compsci) but there's medical technicians, people in data management and analysis, science outreach (esp at observatories, lots of astrophysics at carleton), and several engineers. I'm a test engineer at a private space company, I think someone made it into EE as well\n\nThere's also a class every spring in the physics department called \"what physicists do\" where they bring in alums to talk about their jobs. We got heart surgeons, journalists, climatologists, an electronics technical expert at the CIA, and many more.\n\nBottom line is, job prospects with the degree seem wide and good, if you can direct yourself",

I know a few people who tried to double major and wound up dropping the non-physics one during senior year. I only took intro physics back in like...2016, I think...and loved the class (Arjendu is an amazing professor, highly recommend) but in general the consensus is that physics is one of the hardest STEM majors here.\n\nGeology grad here btw, not sure I can answer much more in detail about the Physics dept but I wish you well!",

He really enjoyed following his interests, but he did put in extra coursework and he said his one *major regret* was that he didn\u2019t have the time to do a study abroad term (you probably know, but Carleton does fantastic SA. I can\u2019t recommend them enough). This might be different for you considering you\u2019re planning more closely related majors, but you still probably need to put in some careful planning if you want to have time to take fun classes or do an abroad term.",

            "comment": "Recent grad here who double majored with STEM. I thought it was doable. It'll be tougher with physics because of labs, but you can get through. Sometimes you'll just end up taking more hard classes than you otherwise would in one term. \n\nIMO, it's worth it if you get to spend more time taking classes you're interested in. Sometimes scheduling can be a little tricky, but if you plan some courses in advance based on what's offered in future terms you'll be fine. An advisor can work with you on that",

            "comment": "Few days late, but was a recent grad who double majored in computer science and mathematics. I was fortunate that courses in CS filled out some of the math requirements which might not be a blessing you have with physics and CS.\n\nI didn't feel like the course load was a burden, but you'll be taking a narrower selection of courses compared to the breath Carleton students usually do. I was going to take those math classes anyways and I wouldn't know what else I would've taken if it weren't for those math courses, so I added the double major after crunching the numbers.\n\nThe only additional work you'll need to consider is doing two senior capstone projects your last year. That may be difficult if you're applying for post-Carleton jobs/graduate school. You may want to minor instead to avoid that (I know a lot of people who did that with math).\n\nAnother fortunate fact is that you don't need to make this decision now. You can come, get a sense of how you're feeling regarding work and appeal to get the major added. You'll need to signatures from department heads, but if you have a good game plan on how to complete the remaining courses you should be fine. They faculty I had to ask were nice about it/didn't care.\n\nIf you're committed to the double major though, then it's totally possible to do it comfortably.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any other questions about it.",

I'm happy with the faculty I got to work with/got to know better in both departments.\n\n&gt; Did you feel like you had time to investigate both majors extensively?\n\nNot as intensively as someone who might major in CS or math exclusively, but more than someone who just casually takes courses in both due to senior capstone/comps.\n\n&gt; What did comps look like for you?\n\nThe CS department is pretty big, so you'll end up working on a project with 3-4 people. You'll rank a few CS projects from a variety of fields, e.g. natural language processing, databases, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and get placed in one.\n\nRegarding math, depends heavily on the project. Some people do solo projects in a very focused/narrow subfield in math, say combinatorics proofs for X concept, or work in a pair/small group tackling another issue. Mine was in math education, so I got to teach kids which was great.",

Few do it because double comps-ing is annoying at points, but if you set your mind to it, then\u2014as I said\u2014you can do it comfortable (at least in my experience).\n\n&gt; How many of you instead opted for the 3-2 experience for both physics and engineering, and what was that experience like?\n\nI know this program is advertised on the Carleton website somewhere, but I'm not sure if anyone did it\u2014at least in my graduating year. I might have missed them, but pretty sure fewer than three students do it at Carleton.",

One thing to keep in mind with a smaller college is that it's easier to get research opportunities because there are gigs for *Carleton students only*.\n\nAdditionally, it's a smaller department and you'll get the know the faculty better who can then write letter of recommendations for you to go to excellent graduate schools. You'll need to try harder at a bigger university where faculty may not want to deal with undergrads and you have more people to compete against/stand out against.\n\nCarleton is focused on your undergraduate education and they'll set you up well to move onto graduate school if that's what you want to do.",

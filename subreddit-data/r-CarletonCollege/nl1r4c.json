Really worried I\u2019m going to regret this decision though! There are so many great things about Carleton on this subreddit, please comment a reason you don\u2019t like it so I feel better haha.",

It\u2019s go go go go go until the end of term, and it can be a lot to keep up with if you\u2019re struggling/having problems/not managing it well. That\u2019s about all I can think of!",

Olaf is a wonderful school and, as u/banjoman63 said, your experience really does come down to your connections and your involvement. I love it here at Carleton; it\u2019s a wonderful school with wonderful people. However that doesn\u2019t mean that St Olaf has any less to offer :)",

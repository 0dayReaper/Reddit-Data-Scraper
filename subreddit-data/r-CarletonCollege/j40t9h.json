The acceptance rate is usually higher in ED compared to RD (I think that's true for most places) so that's slightly in your favor. But I imagine that if they'd accept you ED, they'd probably accept you RD too (though it's very nice to know ahead of the RD kids that you have a school committed!). \n\nGood luck on your app!  Definitely update us if you get accepted! (Preemptive response: it does happen that students will be deferred ED and still accepted RD!  Don't let that deter you)",

Colleges want to increase their \"yield rate,\" which is the percentage of accepted students that choose to attend, because it is factored into national rankings. As a result, they generally accept a slightly higher percentage of students ED. This was a big part of the reason I applied ED more than 10 years ago (jeez the time flies). Good luck!!!",

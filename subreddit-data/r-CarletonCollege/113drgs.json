    "postText": "Hey all. I guess I'm kind of curious about my chances of admission to Carleton given my unique situation. I meet the federal guideline for filing as an independent due to some family issues and having to go into I'm applying as an independent and that situation with my dad was my essay. I know Carleton is not need-blind and my act (29) and gpa (3.5) are lower than average. I'm from a geographically rural and typically underrepresented state at Carleton (Idaho), so I'm more just curious about my chances at this point. Full honesty is greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "Honestly, I don't think anyone will be able to give you a good answer on your chances of admissions. \n\nFilling as an independent is pretty rare; and if you are needing a lot of financial aid, it will be tough. \n\nIt sounds like you already submitted your application and if you did, the only recommendation I have is to reach out to your admissions officer with any questions (but don't reach out too many times) and even the financial aid office so you can get a better understanding of their take on your situation",

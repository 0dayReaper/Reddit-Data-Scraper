Out of the 60-70 internationals we get every year, maybe 10 get a good amount of aid\n-it highly depends on how much need you demonstrate, which is mostly how much your parents make, their assets\n-it also depends on where you're from. If  you're from like Africa/middle east/ latin America or a few other  places that we highly lack students and applicants from, that will make you a great candidate for getting admitted and getting aid",

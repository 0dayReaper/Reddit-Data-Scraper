    "postText": "Currently a student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and am generally not loving the whole big ten school vibe.  I'm a little bit nervous about making friends as a transfer student (especially because i'd be coming in as a junior) but everyone I've met from Carleton seems so nice and happy with the school. What do you all think about the school? Would I have a decent chance of making friends and being happy as a transfer student? How do you all get involved on campus and how did you meet people? Sorry for the question spam and thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Someone transferred into my department as a junior during my senior year--he integrated himself pretty quickly in campus activism/advocacy groups, and made friends within our major quickly. He was pretty happy with it and he transferred from a school with a similar workload, so that wasn't an issue. Really just follow the advice people give you as a freshman--get involved in clubs, talk to your professors a bunch, do things you're passionate about. Tranfer students at Carleton also go through the freshman orientation week, so you'll have that chunk of time to get used to the new environment.\n\nAs for specifics, I'd highly recommend some of the bigger student activities: student radio, concerts at the Cave, PE classes that have clubs attached to them (dance classes, martial arts, etc), and since you'll come in having declared a major, go to events within your department! Some majors are definitely more tight-knit than others, but any reasonably-sized department has a lot of events going on.",

            "comment": "I've been out of school for awhile now, but as a relatively anti-social person, new student week was huge for meeting people, since you have a common bond of not knowing anyone and having some stuff in common. I'm still friends with a good chunk of my freshman year floor (back when 5th Watson was all-male).\n\nOtherwise, IM sports made a difference for me. Specifically, basketball and ultimate. If you're not aware, ultimate is huge at Carleton. PE classes, as IMP1017 said, are also a great option (there was a PE requirement back when I attended, not sure if that's still the case).\n\nOh, and we went to movie nights in Olin on weekends, and if you like pool there are some tables in upper Sayles/Great Space.\n\nGood luck! Some of the most fun times I've ever had were at Carleton, even a decade or two later.\n",

    "postText": "Hi, I am currently trying to figure out where to go to college, and running out of time! There are a few schools that I am still sort of considering (Kenyon, Oberlin, Wesleyan), but I think that ultimately I am down to Carleton and Vassar. Was anyone here considering Vassar before ultimately deciding on Carleton? How did you make your decision?\n\nAlso, is anyone here majoring in Cinema and Media Studies? It's one of my interests and I would appreciate any insights on the department.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hey there,\n\nFirst off, congrats on getting into all those schools! I was in a similar situation to you: I'd narrowed it down to Carleton, Kenyon, and Vassar (and wasn't really leaning toward any of them) and was stressing over making the choice. I'll explain below why I chose Carleton over the others, but first I've got a few pieces of advice that helped me make my choice:\n\n* On paper, list all the different activities and opportunities each school could give you. You can assign different qualities points if you want or just list them like a traditional pro-con list. For me, this took things out of my head and made them more concrete.\n* Try mock-committing to one of the schools for a day and really own it. See how you feel about the decision. Can you envision yourself on the campus, going to classes, and feeling comfortable there?\n* Financial aid was a major decision point, although since Carleton and Vassar both give fantastic financial aid, I'm not sure whether this one could be helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n((Slight disclaimer before I go into how I made my choice: I obviously know much more about Carleton after having gone here for a year, so consider reaching out to someone that goes to Vassar as well so I don't under-represent it))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for what happened with my decision. Of those three schools, the one I actually felt most at home with was Kenyon. I visited all of them, and it was the one that struck me as the most welcoming. Don't get me wrong--I loved all of them--but Kenyon stood out. \n\nHowever, I felt that Kenyon wasn't as academically rigorous (and didn't have as many opportunities) as Carleton or Vassar, and since that was something really important to me, I set it aside for the time being.\n\nAlso, when I visited Vassar, I had the impressions that it was more competitive than Carleton and had a slightly more prominent party scene, both of which were things I wanted to steer away from. Is that to say Carleton isn't competitive at times? Or that Carleton doesn't have parties? No--but it seemed like they were less present.\n\nCarleton prides itself on being 'quirky' and 'weird'--for better or for worse--but the fact that it put an emphasis on that made me feel like I would fit in its environment more.\n\nCarleton was actually lower on my list at first, but I think that's mainly because my brother was there at the time; I wanted to be my own person and all that. But after going through and listing all the characteristics of each school, I felt that Carleton would give me the most choices in terms of what I wanted to study and participate in. I have no idea what to major in, so I wanted a place that had lots of strong departments. Again, Vassar is not bad by any means, but I felt that Carleton was slightly better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I had to give any closing words, it would be: don't stress about this decision. In the end, they're both *amazing* schools and you're going to have an incredible experience no matter which one you go with. There's no wrong choice at this point.\n\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to message me. Best of luck! :)",

            "comment": "i can speak a bit to the CAMS major; a number of my friends were majors and i am familiar with the department from taking some classes. vassar i think has a bigger reputation, and more people may be familiar with it, but that comes with it's own costs and benefits. vassar's department seems to be much larger in terms of faculty and i would guess there are probably more majors than at carleton. vassar's film department is among the oldest in the country and i think it p well financed. carleton has a strong program, but as a newer major with fewer wealthy alums, i don't think it's quite as flush w/ cash. in many ways, they are very similar--they both are a little unusual in that they offer hybrid filmmaking/film studies so you don't have to choose between them as you would at many other schools. are you especially interested in any particular areas within film/media?\n\nas far as the CAMS department goes at carleton--it's PHENOMENAL. one of the best things about it is how much interaction there is between the faculty and students in the department--most majors end up taking courses with all the faculty members. advisors rotate, so you may end up working closely with multiple people. i took courses from most of the professors and am still in touch with a number of them. the benefit of being in a smaller major is that they can get to know the students really well, and develop relationships with them. jay and cecilia sometimes invite their classes over to their house for dinner; carol is a superhuman who offers an insane amount of office hours to compsing seniors. laska has been in touch with graduated students in my class--telling them about film events/grants in the twin cities. the profs are uniformly supportive and knowledgable, and will prepare you well for future careers. people in the major tend to gravitate more towards production than studies, so there isn't a huge pipeline of people going into PhD programs, but if you were interested you would be well supported by faculty. there are lots of opportunities for people interested in production and a lot of alums in the field.\n\nsomething i've noticed is that CAMS majors seem to be pretty close knit; although this probably varies from year to year. the coursework for filmmaking basically requires teamwork to be doable, so there is a culture of collaboration that's pretty ingrained. there's a lot of informal teamwork-- \"i'll watch your rough cut and give you feedback if you watch mine\" of you'll help record sound for a project and they'll do camerawork for you. it seems like the CAMS people are really chill and hang out outside of class too. there's an annual bowling trip for majors and lots of traditions the students do together: when i was a student, some of the majors hosted like weekly hangouts at a local bar to talk about film--idk if these things still happen, but that seemed like an indicator to me that they like each other and keep the conversations going outside of the classroom.\n\nCAMS is especially strong in global cinema (particularly spanish language), sound studies, and documentary studies, although there are also departmental focuses in avant garde/nonfiction filmmaking, and melodrama studies. it generally is pretty slanted towards film, but they just tired a new prof who does TV studies, which is promising. it's a flexible major, so seniors can do comps projects that are video productions, audio projects, audio/video installations, research/theory essays, screenplays, etc. it's pretty easy to tailor the major to fit your interests. and it's easy to take a number of CAMS courses even as a non-major, so if your interest moves in another direction, you still have opportunities to learn about film.\n\nin terms of production, there are a number of classes on filmmaking, and a production office that supplies really fancy video cameras, tripods, rigs, mics, etc. this gear is reserved for students who are in CAMS courses, so they get first dibs. there are 2 TV studios in the Weitz center, as well as an audio recording studio that's available to all students. there's also several editing labs with adobe editing suite. the trimester system makes it hard to work on longer pieces, and sometimes things feel rushed, but there are also advanced production courses where you can work on one sustained project over the term. if you are interested in the major, as a freshman you should take intro CAMS (theory/film analysis) and digital foundations (intro filmmaking). digifound is really popular and can be grueling because it's a lot of projects in a short amount of time, but definitely helps you master the basics. it's usually like 3 projects over a term, with weekly lab sessions where you spend more time learning how to use the gear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOCS programs:\n\ncinema and social change in chile/argentina\n\ncontemporary cinema in europe (berlin, portugal, one other place)\n\ni knew a few people who got credit for a non-carleton program at FAMU in prague\n\n[cams newsletter](https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/cams/camszine/)\\--highlights some alum achievements and what current students are up to\n\n[cams vimeo](https://vimeo.com/camsss) page\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni looked at vassar briefly myself when i was considering schools. liked the campus, but i ultimately felt more at home with the students at carleton. they seemed a bit more friendly and laid back, although admittedly less artsy overall. i've been very happy with my decision and would be happy to talk about this more if you dm me. hope this helps!",

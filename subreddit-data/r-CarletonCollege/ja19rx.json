    "postText": "I\u2019m a prospective student, but the big thing that always turns me off a school is when it has physical education requirements. The good thing looking though the website is that there are some interesting classes. Could I really just do some club tennis, take a fencing class (something I already wanted to do), maybe bowling, and some random class and call it good?",

It\u2019s about a deep awareness of your body and the ability to read other people\u2019s bodies through touch.",

Unfortunately bowling doesn't count (but you really should still come to bowling club, it's very fun), but the classes are great to get them, especially one of the options like bouldering which was super enjoyable. If you're someone who would consider trying club tennis anyway it really shouldn't be much of a big deal.",

Pro tip- try social dance, it's actually a ton of fun and it's usually taught by other students!  They were super nice to me when I had knee issues and ended up sitting out like half the classes.",

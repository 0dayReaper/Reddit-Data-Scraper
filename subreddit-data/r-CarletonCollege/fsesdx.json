            "comment": "they\u2019re all pretty different. first year students are mixed in with upperclassmen in most, but not all of the buildings. there are advantages and disadvantages to each building. most bathrooms are communal; at the start of the year many floors decide if they are gender neutral or separated by gender. usually its a blind vote and if at least one person wants them separated they are. the actual layout of the bathrooms vary by dorm\u2014some have like little separate rooms for each shower and others have more like a stall with a door or curtain. toilets are obviously always in a stall. the idea of sharing a bathroom was freaky to me as an incoming student but i got used to it pretty fast. \n\nburton\u2014west side of campus, connected to a dining hall and the student center. older, irregularly shaped dorm rooms. very quaint. some rooms have more of a suite set up with separated bedrooms, others have random arched windows, panels that clearly used to be fireplaces etc. bathrooms are fairly reasonable here and some inexplicably still have bathtubs although i probably wouldn\u2019t recommend using them. \n\nmusser\u2014affectionately known as \u201cdirty muss\u201d because it\u2019s sort of drab on the inside\u2014has the look of a 60s bunker. very close floor life in this building and it\u2019s known for having dry erase tile walls that people draw on. the bathrooms are ok\u2014showers are separated by curtains and there are two large bathrooms on each floor. also on the west side of campus next to burton.\n\nnourse\u2014older building near the LDC. it\u2019s a smaller dorm and generally has more upperclassmen than first years. the rooms are pretty nice but a little smaller than some other dorms. great, central location. can\u2019t remember the bathrooms but i want to say the showers are  stalls rather than curtains? \n\ncassat\u2014newest building and thus considered the most desirable first year dorm. the bathrooms have showers that are each its own little room with fully solid walls. has the feeling of a hotel more than a dorm. rooms have vinyl/tile floors rather than carpet which most other buildings have. \n\nwatson\u20147 stories. i\u2019m less familiar with the layout of the bathrooms here so someone else will have to weigh in. \n\nmyers\u2014tile walls similar to musser. the fourth floor has enormous windows and a great view. if i recall correctly. similar to musser but on the other side of campus. \n\ngoodhue\u2014lots of first years live in this building. it\u2019s the farthest from the rest of campus because it\u2019s across the lakes. near the rec center if you like to work out. very nice rooms, pretty spacious and well kept. each floor has lots of bathrooms because they each only have one toilet and two showers. i lived here for a year and liked it in general but the layout of the bathrooms was not my favorite, mainly because it was awkward to walk in and realize someone was already using the one stall. but then i would just go walk to a different bathroom. it wasn\u2019t so bad. there\u2019s also a secret bathroom in the basement that everyone forgets about that is good for more privacy. \n\ni think carleton has floor plans for all the dorms posted online; if you\u2019re nervous about it i would definitely look them over. hope this helps! feel free to message me also",

                    "comment": "watson: 2 bathrooms on each floor (I think every floor had them separated by gender when I was there).  Each bathroom has 2 stalls and 2 showers and iirc there's a door to the shower a little room for like your towel, then the standard square shower area.\n\nFreshman can also be in Davis (or at least used to be able to be in Davis) where the bathroom is shared between 2 rooms so you have more ownership of that toilet.  I think shower is also in that room.  I was only ever in Davis for parties when I was with people that had the shared bathroom rooms rather than the quads (quints?) in the corners my friends got when we were seniors.",

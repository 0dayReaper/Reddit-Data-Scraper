I'm applying for Carleton's Fly-In Program (Taste of Carleton) and doing college research in the process so I'm trying to get a feel for what the culture is like and what the students really enjoy.",

Now a graduated senior, I can say the TOC experience is truly an invaluable way to experience campus and it really sold me on the experience! Definitely check out the comedy shows (Lenny Dee, Cujorka), grab a drink at Sayles Cafe, and take some time to just walk around campus. You'll start to get a feel for the place! As for my favorite event, I'd probably say Spring Concert! It's a yearly concert, we had emerging pop singer Maude Latour on campus this past Spring, and it rocked!",

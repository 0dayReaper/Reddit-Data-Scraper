    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nMy name is Nour Azhari and I'm a Clinical Psychology graduate from Columbia University. I am working on a research initiative to better understand mental health on college campuses in the US.\n\nWe are currently speaking to college students/recent grads who are **struggling with their mental health and have reached out to the counselling center but have been put on the waitlist or have long wait times between their therapy sessions and are looking for help.**\n\nWould you be open to speaking to us briefly for about 20 mins in the next few weeks?\n\nI would so appreciate your perspective, wisdom, and experience to help guide our efforts.\n\nIf you are willing to help us please let me know what times work with you by directly scheduling a call here: [https://calendly.com/.../mental-health-in-college-campuses](https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses?fbclid=IwAR1vLWXZFjvcRaAAaU7JsKQUr-K-AvyorCs1WrlVwgL8VvVogJw1IM06kss)\n\nAnd if you have any questions, feel free to email me at [noursazhari@gmail.com](mailto:noursazhari@gmail.com).\n\nI look forward to meeting and speaking with you.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nNour Azhari",

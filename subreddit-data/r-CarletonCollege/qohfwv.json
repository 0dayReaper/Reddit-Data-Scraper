    "postText": "Hey folks, I'm considering pursuing a staff position at Carleton College.  One concern I have is that I don't have a driver's license due to some visual impairments. Were I to pursue and ultimately land a job there, what is campus like?  Are there apartments within walking distance of campus?  Is the town laid out in a pedestrian-friendly manner?  Or is Northfield's public transit robust enough to substitute for a car?\n\nShoe leather and my electric scooter are my primary forms of conveyance and I don't see that changing.\n\nI'm currently working at a conservative religious college in a VERY Trumpy county in Iowa, and I'm looking for a new working environment that's more in line with my values.\n\nI know this place is primarily populated by students but I wonder if you'd be willing to share what the town and campus are like for somebody who lives a car-free life.  I'm independently researching Northfield but thought I'd stop in here to get some thoughts as well.  Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Northfield is a great community, Carleton is a great school to attend/ work at. \n\n I will admit there is not a lot of retail for a town of approximately 20000 people. There is a really nice, clean, family fare supermarket just at the end of the main downtown area in Northfield. Probably about a 7 minute walk from the edge of campus. there is a target and a larger grocery store about 1.5-2 mi from campus. Not walkable in the Winter.. You will find everything you need in town, but not really anything more than that.\n\n It's an incredibly bike friendly city, with parks and paths everywhere.\n\n It is $15, bookable in advance, for a shuttle to/ from Northfield to multiple locations in Minneapolis such as the airport and Mall of America..",

                    "comment": "This is very helpful, thanks!  In my current town of 6,000 in Northern Iowa, it has most things I need within a 15 minute walk, but like you mentioned not a lot of great retail establishments.  The nearest wal-mart is 15 miles away, and there's no shuttle service into and out of town.  So having a Target is a step up.  \n\nDuring decent weather months I ride an electric scooter around town but park it during winter once snow starts staying on the ground.  I do a lot of online ordering to get by and I imagine I'd be able to do the same up in Northfield, just with more travel options available in the town.  Between the shuttle service to and from the cities (which, honestly, would be a huge expansion of my world) and the regular [bus routes](https://www.threeriverscap.org/transportation/hiawathaland-transit/northfield-service-area) (I seem to be reading these as regular, timed, routes, that get more limited during extended breaks in the colleges academic schedules, but correct me if I'm wrong) I think I'd have better options for getting around than the town I'm in now.  \n\nIf you know off the top of your head:  Is there a bike-path / sidewalk down to the Movie theater and target area?  It looks from maps like it's like on a divided six-lane road called Faribault and is 2-3 miles from campus--are businesses like the movie theater accessible on foot or scooter/bike?  I dont' think I'd feel comfortable travelling with traffic on a road that big.  I don't see marked crosswalks for instance across Faribault and that makes it feel more like a highway.",

                            "comment": "You can take Jefferson (parallels rt3 on SE side) to target from just south of the town center. Sidewalks are present south of Woodley. Some streets north of this have sidewalks, but are more residential and low traffic anyway.\nEast River trail (to theater/ Menards) starts at the co-op (another food store near campus that I forgot about) and goes under rt3 to NW side of that road. Not usable in snow. Dumps out in residential area behind theater. \n\nMight be able to see this on Google maps bike route as well.\n\nCub supermarket by target delivers. Instacart (but not sure how many instacart people are in Northfield -I've never seen one in Northfield myself while shopping- but I'm not here year round) will deliver from family fare. Can pre order for pickup from both.",

            "comment": "hey there! northfield is a very cute town and pretty walkable, but it will depend on where you find a unit. downtown is pretty condensed and VERY close to campus. i lived there for a year and my walk was about 7-8 minutes door to door. bear in mind it can be longer if it\u2019s icy out though. there are lots of apartments further out (1.5 miles ish, near the target) which might be edging towards a little far, but if i recall correctly there is an intermittent bus route that goes from campus to target, so that would be an option for bigger grocery runs if needed. i had a car while there but rarely used it because i walked most places. i would start looking around at housing options, there are units but finding the right one close to campus will be important.",

                    "comment": "Thanks!  This is helpful.  In the town I live now, in NW Iowa, it's similar - I have a five minute walk door-to-door home-to-work, and 10-15 minute walks to most things.  And I'm used to pulling on my yak-trax for winter trekking when the sidewalks are icy. I just imagine a couple hundred miles north it's colder, for longer during winter.  \n\nIt seems like Northfield also has a [couple of fairly regular bus routes,](https://www.threeriverscap.org/transportation/hiawathaland-transit/northfield-service-area) as well as a dial-a-ride type service, but I need to dig into that.  There's a newer place called the fifth street lofts that looks really nice, and if I can swing it, that would be my first choice pending vacancies.  Looks to be less than 3/4 mile from campus, and fairly luxurious.    \n\nIf the town is laid out in a fairly bicycle-friendly way, it would be awesome to take my scooter around town using bike paths.  \n\nI wonder if there's a hy-vee in a town close enough to deliver through Aisles Online (there's one 15 miles away from me that delivers to my town)\n\nI'm particularly excited about the idea of the shuttle that goes back and forth between St Olaf, Carleton, and the MSP airport.  I like the freedom that would give me to be able to go into the cities and do stuff.",

Especially since I imagine it'd only be like once or twice a month.\n\nI had a zoom interview last week, and I should find out whether or not I advance to the next round of on-campus interviews as soon as the week after Thanksgiving.\n\nCarleton is such a step up in quality and reputation from the private liberal arts college where I work right now--to the point that it's almost intimidating!  But I love everything I've heard about it.  The school where I work right now is so religious, and so conservative, to the point where it's openly hostile to the LGBTQIA+ community, and students of color often don't feel comfortable here. I've been feeling more and more uncomfortable supporting the overall mission of a place like this.",

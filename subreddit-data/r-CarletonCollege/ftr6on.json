            "comment": "I\u2019d say my favorite thing about Carleton would be a tie between the professors and the general social/academic \u201cvibe\u201d of campus. With respect to the former, they\u2019re simply incredible. Fascinating people, talented teachers, dedicated friends. It\u2019s ridiculous how much they put into their classes; it sometimes feels like they work even harder than their students, but then that commitment loops back and motivates us students to push ourselves that much more. I was shocked the first time I went to office hours and my professor was waiting with a handwritten list of personalized observations and recommendations. With respect to the latter, it genuinely is as curious, open-minded, and unpretentious as people say. Obviously there are exceptions, but I feel so much freer and accepted in college than I did in high school overall. Most people don\u2019t take themselves too seriously, trading competitiveness for silly humor and a habit of helping others. It feels like everyone has so many random wacky interests that they could major in five or six different things. Students are super serious / intense about learning, not so much about grades. \n\nMy least favorite thing would be the political environment. Although not nearly as bad as some of its peers, the campus is certainly something of an echo chamber, and some parts of the community definitely seem intent on fostering a callout culture. I think this is unfortunate, and somewhat antithetical to Carleton\u2019s spirit of otherwise open inquiry and tolerance. \n\nOverall, I hecking love my school and would be very happy to talk about it further if you want to PM me. :)",

One of the best things about Carleton is that Carls are so so so so helpful and kind. During this whole pandemic I\u2019ve had no less than six people I\u2019ve had classes with reach out to me to check up on me. Another thing I absolutely love is the SWA dogs, which are dogs that come in periodically throughout the week that you can go and pet/hang out with. I\u2019ve found it to be a great change to talk to different people and have nice chill conversations while getting to interact with very good boys and girls.\n\nOne thing I personally don\u2019t love about Carleton is a lot of stuff will happen in the evening/at night. As someone who likes to be in bed at 9:30 it can be hard for me to socialize, but as I\u2019ve continued being at Carleton I\u2019ve found great friends who fit in with my sleep habits. There is also more partying than I expected, though honestly it\u2019s probably pretty standard for most colleges. I don\u2019t party and I\u2019ve been able to find plenty of people to become friends with who don\u2019t as well.\n\nLike I said, feel free to message me for more! I love Carleton so much and could talk about it forever",

Still, after graduating almost 20 years ago, we all keep in touch, and a subset of us still get together in person for annual mini reunions. The strongest friendships of my life were formed there, centered around my freshman year floor. There's a real bonding that happens when it's colder than a witch's teat outside.\n\nI also loved going for walks through Northfield in the evenings (RIP Petricka's, and More4), to occasionally get away from screaming friends playing N64 games.\n\nLeast favorite thing was a specific CS professor, who has since retired.",

It's an amazing event, and is pretty emblematic of the Carleton spirit",

(2013 grad) Permits were expensive and not covered by financial aid, so if you dare try to have another job outside of walking distance from campus it\u2019s not easy and it\u2019s expensive. You also cannot just park in city parking either - security checks there too - which felt really unfair. \n\nI loved the classes and professors the most. I really haven\u2019t kept in touch with many of my friends from school but I still treasure the diverse knowledge I was introduced to. I know I was part of a subset while they were changing grad requirements that had a lot of freedom picking classes so maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so easy for current students, but I took so many \u201cIntro to blah blah\u201d and Shakespeare and Byzantine history and Pottery and Astronomy etc etc. That\u2019s the stuff that has stayed with me and I\u2019ve continued interests in.",

I had a ton of medical problems one year and basically needed to park closer (lived in faculty club but parking near Goodhue) but not so badly that I needed a handicap placard. Doctor wrote a note, security still refused. I ended up crying in the security office. It was so frustrating!! \nId never change my decision to go to Carleton though. I met my husband there, I learned so much about so many things, and had a wonderful experience overall.",

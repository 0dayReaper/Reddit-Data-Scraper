            "comment": "Hey, 2013 CAMS grad here! Fantastic major program, with a strong support structure. Equipment is signed out, nothing too out of date, and a great foundation in the theory as well. The Weitz building was mainly built for the CAMS dept, and I spent a ton of time there. (Although dress warmly if you\u2019re there after hours in the winter! They used to turn the heat down to \u201cunused\u201d classrooms) It looks like the profs/staff have expanded since I was there, but all the staff were filmmakers or photographers with strong experience in the industry. My comps advisors were Laska Jimsen and Carol Donelan and both were easy to talk to and excellent teachers. I remember Berhardt does a bit of intersection with the theater dept too. I enjoyed the theory classes, and if you do decide to go with it, I would recommend taking film intersection classes outside the dept as well. My favorite was a philosophy class \u2014 I think it was called Film and Emotion. CAMS was an interesting major because you could focus on theory, practical movie making, or photography, so when I was there people graduated with pretty diverse interests within the idea of \u201cmedia\u201d. \n\nAs far as difficulty \u2014 Carleton expects a high level of effort and time but there\u2019s not a competitive culture.",

            "comment": "i had some friends in CAMS and took a few classes there myself. really strong department. it\u2019s a close-knit major because a lot of the film production work is done in groups. my observation was that lots of people in the major liked each other and hung out outside of class. it\u2019s a popular major but not so big that you don\u2019t get individual attention. as far as i know it doesn\u2019t have a reputation for being especially easy or especially hard. like many things, it\u2019s sort of what you make of it. \n\ncarleton\u2019s CAMS program is unusual in that it is an even mix of film studies/theory and film production. lots of a schools have separate programs or ask you to specialize whereas at carleton you have to take some of both and can choose electives based on interest. it\u2019s a well respected program and many students go on to either grad programs or into production in the industry or in related fields like advertising/communications. \n\nthe profs are uniformly great and all are very, very accessible and love teaching. they seem to really care about the students. the CAMS study abroad programs are strong and carleton has an especially great program in global cinema studies if that\u2019s something that interests you. feel free to DM me if you have more questions",

            "comment": "Back in my Carleton days (mid-90's) this was a special major that you had to petition for.  I really enjoyed the theory and the production courses that I took.  Back then, the production part was not as advanced as the tons of theory courses you could take.  I imagine that the new facility (and advancements and low costs of tech) has really helped with advancing this part of the department.  I also held a student work study job for the media services center in Scoville so the application of knowledge when filming events and setting up equipment was a great compliment to my Carleton educational experience.  My advice - get in touch with Paul Hager who teaches several CAMS courses:\n\n* CAMS 101: Making Media (Winter 2021)\n* CAMS 177: Television Studio Production (Spring 2021)\n\nHe is a really nice man and will give you all of the information you need.    \nHere is his web page link:   [Paul Hager | Profiles | Carleton College](https://apps.carleton.edu/profiles/phager/) \n\nPS - I was able to visit the new facility during 2019 summer reunion and it is super cool!",

I am wondering if anyone knows the situation of financial aid for international students? Carleton doesn\u2019t disclose the common data set so it\u2019s hard for me to find anything online. Thanks!!",

I believe there are specific international scholarships that offer near full aid. It is more limited than the aid available to US students due to the nature of federal financial aid funding. I am sure that the Carleton financial aid office would be happy to answer questions in detail &amp; knows more about it than anyone on Reddit.",

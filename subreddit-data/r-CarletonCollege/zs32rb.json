It is honestly not that bad, just know what activities you would want to do at Carleton and what you might want to major in. It\u2019s not like an interrogation, it\u2019s more of a conversation about who you are, what you do in your community, and what you would do at Carleton. Feel free to DM me if you want more information!",

Mostly they asked about the things I like to do in school and what is important to me, as well as what I think is important to a learning environment in general. It\u2019s a very relaxed conversation, and I really enjoyed it because it made me feel more connected to the school!",

I had mine today and he was sporadic today",

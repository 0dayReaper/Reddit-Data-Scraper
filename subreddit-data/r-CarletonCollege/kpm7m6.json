            "comment": "Hopefully other Carls can chime in with a better answer as I'm not GF. But I do know that both dining halls have specific sections solely for GF food. On top of that, each food option that served everyday has these cards with \"stickers\" that denote what type of food it is (GF, Vegetarian, Vegan, etc.). There's also a booklet/binder of all food served with its ingredient list if you want to check that.\n\nEdit: here's an example photo of those \"stickers\" https://i.imgur.com/e0mjQWF.jpg",

            "comment": "Echoing what the other commenter said, there are always gluten free things available. Food in the dining hall is served out of trays at stations and many things will not contain gluten (like most proteins, and veggies) and will be clearly labeled. There is also gluten free baked products (both desserts and breads) that are always available. Sayles, our cafe, is less good with GF options but they are still pretty easy to be found (like corn tortillas, salads instead of sandwiches, etc). In personally not GF but I worked with our disability services office and know if your allergy is severe you can also get some accommodations for dining as well",

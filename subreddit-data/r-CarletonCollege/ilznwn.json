            "comment": "As far as I can tell, it's a scholarship for International students. There's no particular way to get the Starr scholarship specifically; instead Carleton's financial aid office will award students their scholarships and then simply decide which \"Named\" one they get. \n\nEdit: The donors of \"Named\" scholarships can specify certain criteria for who can get them. In this case, the Starr scholarship is for students from Asia\n\n(Being \"Named\" just means that the $$$ can be traced back to an actual donor as opposed to being sourced from just a pool of cash that Carleton has for fin aid). Not everyone gets \"Named\" ones, others will get \"generic\" Carleton funds. \n\nDon't quote me on this but I'm pretty sure it's how it works. If you want more information about this or anything else, let me know. I can ask around for you",

Like his/her average grades, ECAs, LOTRs, etc?\n\n3)  While I've already registered for OCTOBER's SAT, in my country there's a 99 percent chance that it won't take place. Now, my question is, will I able to get this scholarship with a SAT SCORE?\n\nThanks!",

First off I want to say sorry about the troll, just ignore him. \n\nThe scholarship comes from the Starr foundation, and while I can\u2019t find when their specific partnership with Carleton started, the organization was founded in 1955. Carleton won\u2019t publish the stats of scholarship winners for privacy reasons, but only around 10 international students get full funding each year. This means you have to be an incredibly, incredibly competitive applicant to receive the scholarship. In terms of your SAT score, Carleton is test optional this year, so you\u2019re not required to submit a test score, but not having one could make it hard to get a scholarship compared to applicants who do. I wish you the best of luck and hope to see you at Carleton next year!",

Having strong scores could help but not having scores won't hurt. On top of that, scores are only one part of the review of applications. \n\nSource: worked in admissions for a summer.",

    "postText": "**Pitzer BSDO w/ WesternU Health Sciences**  \n**Pros**  \n\\- 7-year BSDO program would mean I get my DO at the age of 25 which is nice, this is a program that only accepts 6 people each year so I am extremely lucky to get in  \n\\- guaranteed a spot in Western U medical school (ranking is about 94-120 out of \\~190) if I meet very basic requirements for MCAT and GPA, meaning that I might not have to go through the whole application process  \n\\- will not have to struggle over choosing classes or finding internships since everything is basically set for all 3 years of college, even summers are all planned out (ex. Taking classes on campus 1st-year summer, going to Costa Rica to intern 2nd-year summer)  \n\\- location, CA is closer to home and warmer, part of the Claremont schools  \n**Cons**  \n\\- a less academic environment  \n\\- restrictive, basically have no chance of going to a better or different medical school  \n\\- It is a DO program, not MD. As much as I do love it, it is still more restrictive than MD since MD medical schools tend to require higher academic performances and often have more freedom when choosing which specialty they want for residency\n\n**Carleton College**  \n**Pros**  \n\\- great student dynamics, people are known for not being competitive to the point that it is toxic, I heard everyone is super friendly  \n\\- undergraduate teaching is one of the best, all classes taught by professor  \n\\- great pre-med counselor and alumni system and apparently I heard medical schools like students from Carleton  \n\\- more prestigious than Pitzer  \n**Cons**  \n\\- freezing, far, food might not be that good  \n\\- getting an A is very difficult (but medical schools are supposed to know this so IDK if it's a con...)  \n\\- I might risk not being able to get into a medical school at all or end up in a medical school not even as good as WesternU. I perhaps might even have to take a year off just to apply to medical schools like a lot of people do. Most people apply to about 25+ medical schools, get interviewed to about 3-4, and then get into maybe 1.  \n\\- kinda related to the last one, but I will have to spend a lot of time trying to find internships and research opportunities  \n\\-most likely the regular 4 years graduation instead of 3 years  \nSorry for making it super long, thank you so much in advance if you could provide some advice.",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm a current Carleton student and I'd be happy to help you decide.\n\nIt sounds like you're pretty set on the idea of going to medical school right now. If you are absolutely sure you want to go to Western U for a DO degree after your undergraduate studies, then Pitzer seems like a good choice. If you really like the feeling of certainty having 3 years planned out gives you, then that may be a sign that Pitzer is better.\n\nHowever, if you think that your feelings about medical school are likely to change in the next couple of years, that fixed path may become a drawback. If you would strongly prefer an MD degree to a DO degree, it might be better not to commit to the BSDO program. \n\nI also think that internships and research opportunities are not scarce for Carleton students. The Career Center can help you find and apply to them, and you can also find them through your professors. Having to take the initiative in finding them allows you to tailor them to your needs (and get practice applying for jobs).  \n\nCarleton also has lots of academic support available for students, so while it isn't *very* easy to get an A, I wouldn't describe it as very difficult, either. It depends on the strength of your study habits and time management skills (as well as on the class).\n\nIf you're the kind of person who can adapt easily to new environments and situations, the change of weather and food may not be as big of a deal as you suspect it will be. I had never even seen snow before coming to Carleton and, while the cold took some getting used to, it wasn't as hard to adjust to as anyone said it would be. (If you suspect the decrease in sunlight will affect you emotionally, I would recommend getting a light-box to use during winter term.)\n\nCarleton is very flexible in terms of course choices and how you spend breaks. Students here often come in with one idea of what they want to study and do after they graduate, and change their minds and reevaluate their goals later. If you would really value the option to easily change your mind, Carleton might be better.\n\nThis was a long post so **my most basic advice is:**\n\n* If you are **absolutely sure you want to go to Western U for a DO degree after college, choose Pitzer**. \n* If you would value **the option to change your mind, or tailor your 4-year experience** (including breaks) **more to your personal interests, Carleton may be the better choice**.\n\nEither way, you sound very driven and ambitious, and I think you'll find success wherever you go! Feel free to DM me if you want to hear more about what Carleton is like or more details about my experience there so far :)",

            "comment": "To echo other posters, Carleton graduates do very well applying to med school. Think of the biggest names in the game, there are Carleton \nalumni there right now or just recently graduated. \n\nA few other thoughts to consider: first, you\u2019re committing to DO (vs MD). There is absolutely nothing wrong with going DO, your training will be 99% the same, and you\u2019ll be just as fantastic a doctor as your MD colleagues. However the brutal truth is, you will be at a disadvantage when it comes to matching in certain specialties. Not impossible or insurmountable by any means, but just a little extra challenging. When it comes to decisions like these, my thought process is to not close any doors of opportunity prematurely. Along that same train of thought, as confident as you are that medicine is what you want to do, you might find something you enjoy more. If that\u2019s the case, are you going to regret choosing Pitzer?",

            "comment": "That's a great question and a tough one to \"know\" especially w/o having an on-campus visit.\n\n**Here's what I can say:** Carleton is a place where students are actively encouraged to explore all interests they have and to find new ones they didn't know about.  We're not a competitive school at all (so if you thrive off of doing better than others, this probably isn't the school for you), instead students here are very supportive of one another (and the profs and staff are so extremely supportive as well.)\n\nAs to the nerdiest and quirkiest lol well, that's true.  Take a look at our unofficial and even official traditions and they're pretty unique if I can claim that.  Carleton does a pretty good job of making our student body diverse in all aspects and it creates such an artificial (and fun) environment that you legitimately won't get anywhere else.\n\nAnd not to mention that we've been ranked #1 in Undergraduate teaching for like the past 13 years in a row or so ;)\n\n**Here's the \"But\":** To be honest, you'd probably be happy at any school you go to.  It's more about making the best of your situation.  If you have the chance to come here, I (with my clear bias) would say go for it 10/10.  But if you don't, that's okay, you'll do fine at a lot of places.  Academically, a lot of small liberal arts colleges will give you a great education.  They just won't have that same quirky, supportive campus we have lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you got more questions",

I got a chance to do a virtual visit through the Taste of Carleton program which is traditionally on campus, but they did manage to illuminate aspects of the Carl experience. I appreciate the response, it seems to me that carleton is a school that you just have to visit to see whether its a good fit or not. I hope I get that opportunity should COVID-19 permit it",

All of these can be found through Carleton Admissions (which are all awesome people!).\n\nAs for me, I absolutely love Carleton. I knew it was the right school for me when I got to visit it my senior year and I meshed really well with the \u201cvibe\u201d. Having led virtual tours and helped out with social media stuff recently, I think you can get a good approximation of the vibe virtually as well\n\nAlso, feel free to DM me and I can talk more specifically about stuff as well!",

It was a great experience and I'll never forget it.\n\nNow I don't go here, but I will say that the campus is so unique and memorable that even after all these years I still remember all the small details like the statues, the architecture of the buildings, the dorms, and more. You'll never find another place quite like it and I hope to visit again sometime.\n\nAcademic wise, based off the two CS classes I was in, Carleton definitely deserved their ranking for undergraduate teaching. The professors really knew what they were talking about and answered any and all questions people had in a way that taught everyone something.\n\nThe only downsides I can think of is that I believe only a certain type of person would enjoy a place like Carleton. I had the opportunity to go here and decided not to because, though I enjoyed my time visiting, I couldn't see myself living and studying here for 4 years. Ultimately, it's up to you.",

Even years after visiting I still remember the iconic brick walkways, the layout of the dorms, the classes I took for a day (Intro to CS and intro to Japanese), and more.\n\nEven though I decided upon a more tech/engineering focused school, I could see that Carleton had a LOT more to offer for those seeking liberal arts degrees. If that's your thing, you'll excel here and you'll meet a lot of unique and memorable people too.",

I want to make sure that the college I go to cares about their students. You are more than welcome to give any other information you wish about how this college has helped you, and can either comment or dm me. Thank you!",

We were generally behind the curve (about a week and a half behind Grinnell) on getting spring term cancelled; this was a mite problematic since some kids had already left, and hadn\u2019t packed up their rooms. \n\nActually, they technically haven\u2019t moved the second half of spring term online yet; we are still following the polite fiction that we are coming back for the second half of term.",

They didn\u2019t communicate really anything to us (except that they didn\u2019t believe they had the resources for online class which was also not true) and then the Thursday before finals weekend they drop on us that we have to pack our entire rooms up before we left for spring break/next term. Honestly given how quick corona came up on us I\u2019m not really that upset but also I really think Carleton knew they were going to have us pack and should\u2019ve said something sooner. We do get an extra week of spring break tho.",

It's always a matter of perspective; what does safe mean to you, safe relative to what other place, etc. But I've lived/worked in or around a handful of other college campuses and I heard fewer reports of safety concerns in Northfield than I did at any of the others.",

            "comment": "I grew up in Northfield, and it's easily the safest place I've ever lived. The cops had so little to do that they'd spend their time tracking down people's outdoor cats and taking them home. In my early 20s, I'd regularly walk across town at 2am after my closing shift at the Carleton library, and I never felt unsafe.\n\nre: jay's comment, I'll confirm that casual racism isn't surprising to me from Northfield townies, but that's just America (especially rural America) for you. There's never been anything close to a hate crime in Northfield that I know of, most of the town is quite progressive even if it's very white, and Carleton itself is even more progressive and diverse than Northfield the town.\n\nOverall: I've had hundreds of friends in and around Northfield and Carleton, several of them international Asian students, and very few have ever reported feeling unsafe. Not everyone likes the place (small towns and small colleges aren't for everyone), but safety has very rarely ever come up as an issue.",

            "comment": "I was an Asian international student at Carleton back a few years ago and I would say Northfield was safe. I could walk in downtown Northfield at midnight without feeling threatened by anything. I have had a couple of racist incidents from Northfield middle schoolers (they could be high schoolers, too), though, and they were traumatizing. But that's what happens in a rural place that is virtually entirely white.",

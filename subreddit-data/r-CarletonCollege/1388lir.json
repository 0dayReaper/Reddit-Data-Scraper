    "postText": "As a junior, I do so much research on colleges and Carleton remains at the top of my list at the end of every search. I don\u2019t want to go to a large school where partying and sports is the norm, instead I wanna go somewhere where the student population is more nerdy and academics-oriented. Also, I love cold weather so that\u2019s a plus. This being said, my application is severely lacking extra curricular wise. Do you guys have any recommendations for getting into Carleton? Even just listing some of your important college app info would help, Thank youuu!",

Unless you are a recruited athlete, you can\u2019t count on getting into any one school.  It\u2019s a bit of a lottery.  So, apply to a group of small LACs and you will probably get into at least one or two.",

Showing them that you as a human being and not just a list of extracurriculars would be a good fit for the liberal arts program and specifically the one at Carleton was an instrumental part of mine, and I think it helped them make a decision about admitting me. Highlighting how much you want to be there and how you think you can both add to the community and grow from it can only make you a better candidate for admission!",

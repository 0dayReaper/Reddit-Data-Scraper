    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was admitted to the class of 2026 and am having a very difficult time choosing between Carleton and another college. I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me a bit more information before I make a final decision. \n\nThere are a couple things I would like to know:\n\n1.) What is the environmental studies program like there and is it common/easy to do a double major with biology? \n\n2.) What would you say are the best aspects of the college socially and academically ?\n\n3.) Has your experience there been mostly positive?\n\nThank you to anyone who may respond to this!",

            "comment": "ENTS is super interdisciplinary and arguably one of the most common things to double major in. The ENTS and ENTS-adjacent profs I had and met were lovely people (George Vrtis in History is a fantastic person, Tsegaye Nega is tough but incredibly knowledgeable and so so worth getting to know, Intro Geology might be worth your time just to get a class with Clint or Bereket). Just looking at the [major requirements](https://www.carleton.edu/environmental-studies/major/requirements/), you can definitely have a ton of overlap with a bio major. However, double majoring at Carleton in general is HARD no matter what. Having to do two comps projects is time consuming and for some people it means missing out on other opportunities (such as studying abroad). It also means there are a lot fewer classes you can get away with scrunching (taking pass/fail), which is a safety net that most people utilize at *least* once.\n\nI struggled a little bit socially, but I still have some friends I trust wholly and love unconditionally (including my fianc\u00e9e!). Most people seem to find their people via an extracurricular, or a sport, or in their department after a couple of years. Parties are very common and I felt there was a bit of pressure to get into it, but it is avoidable--I didn't really party much until sophomore year, and even then I usually kept to small events. That all said, I graduated a few years ago so I'm not going to pretend to know the current social dynamics, it can change from year to year and I'm sure it's different since Covid. \n\nAcademically, expect to be challenged for sure, but people are looking out for you. The vast majority of profs and TAs *want* you to succeed. It took me a little while to internalize that, and I certainly can't speak for everybody, but even when I had low points I knew there was a professor or adviser who I could talk to--even if it wasn't someone I took a class from during that term. It's easy to make those connections with profs at a small school, and incredibly valuable as time goes on.\n\nMy experience was mostly positive. My biggest complaint was that there is a *lot* of underlying elitism--it's a very wealthy, very white school, and I grew up low-income. There was some culture shock there, even as a straight white male-presenting person I felt unwelcome by some people who were \"supposed\" to be there based on my socioeconomic status. If you come from a lower-income background, or are a person of color, I don't want to dissuade you (it's an incredible opportunity). Just know that it caused me a hell of a lot of unnecessary anxiety.\n\nBest of luck wherever you wind up :)",

            "comment": "Hey! I was just admitted this year and committed a few days ago, so I don't know much about the current situation in Carleton yet. But I would love to share why I chose to attend!\n\nI talked to A LOT of current students and alumni on Reddit Instagram and other platforms and asked a lot of questions through DMs about the social scene and their experience at Carleton. I was actually quite surprised, because of the 10 or so people I talked to, literally not one mentioned a major drawback or told me they were unhappy with their experience there. Some did mention that the food was a bit bland and that the campus was in a rural area, but they also said that there are other options for eating like going to nearby schools, and visiting the city is also pretty easy because it's just 40 minutes away. Some have also mentioned that they like that it's kind of rural because that way, everyone stays on campus most of the time and it's easy to make friends this way. Everyone I talked to was also SO SO nice, like I was honestly amazed! I could just feel how willing everyone is to help out each other (the staff were so nice to me too), and that's honestly one reason why I committed. I think I could see myself really having fun here and getting to know a lot of new professors and friends.\n\nAnother thing I really liked is the academically rigorous yet not competitive atmosphere. I'm someone who does really bad under pressure and my high school was also very competitive, so I really wanted to go somewhere where I can just relax and have fun but still be able to study. Half the people I talked to also mentioned this is why they like Carleton!\n\nNot sure if this was helpful in any way since I don't even go there, but I just wanted to share why I personally decided to commit! But wherever you decide to commit to, I hope you the best!",

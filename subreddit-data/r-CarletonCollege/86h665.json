    "postText": "Hi! I just got accepted to Carleton and I don't know too much about the school. \n\nI saw on College Confidential something about the students at Carleton being intense, and taking pride/competing in not getting lots of sleep. I want an atmosphere that's smart and passionate but chill and friendly. I also know Carleton is relatively more STEm focused than some other LACs, so does that contribute to any competitiveness?\n\nAlso, compared to other small liberal arts colleges it seems to have a pretty great film major from looking at the course list. This is a slim shot, but I would love any insight about your experience if anybody here is in the Cinema and Media Studies Program. Thanks!",

It\u2019s a fantastic program and Carleton has done a lot to push it up into one of their quality majors, they basically built the Weitz just for CAMS. There\u2019s a production office to sign out up to date equipment and the study abroad trip was amazing. It\u2019s definitely worth checking out. Accepted student days were what clinched going there for me, I\u2019d recommend it if you\u2019re not sure about the social climate. ",

People care about their grades, of course, but it's not as competitive as I've heard other schools are. We're definitely intense and try to do well. There's a weird pride in not getting sleep but I feel like that's normally accompanied by \"but actually though, get some sleep\". No matter where you go people will miss sleep. Carleton students have a focus on mental health so if you do feel like you're struggling in that aspect the students and faculty are very supportive. Not getting sleep is not the expectation.\n\nI was a STEM/Social science double major. I think we're more focused on STEM than other liberal arts schools. I can't speak for other liberal arts schools, but when visiting my friends at other bigger schools I also felt like students at Carleton were significantly more well rounded than at other places. For example, two of my really good friends were CS/Art majors. \n\nI've heard really good things about the CAMS department. One of my roommates was another STEM major who took a ton of CAMS classes, and I was friends with a few of the CAMS students. There's a ton of equipment you can rent out for shooting stuff and people are generally enthusiastic about taking part in your films. I can't speak for the classes themselves since I've never taken one but everything I've heard about them was positive.",

It's known as a \"work hard, play hard\" kind of place. The atmosphere sounds like it's exactly what you're looking for--students are smart and passionate, but also chill and super friendly! Seriously, everyone is really nice and welcoming. It's not competitive. \nI have a friend that is a first year at Carleton right now, and she has been taking a lot of CAMS courses this year... and she seems to really be thriving and loving it! I think you would enjoy the program.\nHope to see you there next year!!",

Wasnt a CAMS major but had friends in it, and it seemed like a tight knit happy bunch. Good study abroad program options as well. Friends got jobs in filmmaking, location scouting and screenwriting in NYC and LA after college. My advice is to ask Admissions to put you in touch with an alum from CAMS, and take a look at the courses offered in comparison to other schools you\u2019re considering.",

            "comment": "It's odd that you've heard Carleton is competitive, because I chose it because it appeared to me to be the *least* competitive/pretentious school on my radar. And I'm pretty sure that's its general reputation. People use the example of students leaving their lights on just to look like they're working through the night as an example of what the antithesis of the Carleton atmosphere is. If anything, I see people complain that Carleton students are too self-effacing. \n\nIts CAMS program is strong. As far as I'm aware, it's relatively new, so a new, small department at a small LAC will be understandably limited. However, Carleton is a fantastic school with great students, and is ranked as the #1 LAC in the nation for undergraduate teaching on USNWR (although Carleton also seems to demonstrate a general aversion to ranking culture; not to the extent that say, Reed does, but still, it adds to what I'm saying about Carleton being a distinctly collaborative over competitive institution). It's also the second highest ranked LAC for film and photography on Niche, behind Wesleyan. \n\nIf it helps, I got a little obsessed with the college process over the past few years, so I will say I've read a lot about the comparative personalities of a good number of schools. Or at least what the general online consensus is. But I've talked to many friends at different places too, and have visited the following campuses in my lifetime:\n\nStanford, Berkely, UCLA, UCSD, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Pomona, Pitzer, Harvey Mudd, Scripps, Claremont McKenna, Reed, Macalester, UChicago, Caltech, MIT, Carleton, Wesleyan. \n\nPlease please feel free to DM me or text me about this if you wanna have a more thorough / direct conversation. I absolutely love Carleton and am excited to be attending but I'd love to help you make the most informed decision that you can either way. :) \n\nFor what it's worth, my last college visit was to Macalester, Carleton, UChicago, and Reed. Before visiting, I was pretty much torn between those last three. Afterwards, Carleton was the clear winner. It had what I personally thought to be the prettiest campus I've ever seen. But the thing that struck me the most and made me so confident about applying ED was how distinctly, genuinely kind the students were there. I'm not trying to exaggerate, but my mom and I got the most smiles, and the most help, from the Carleton students. I fell in love. \n\nBut yeah, in short: Carleton is collaborative over competitive, it has a small but strong CAMS department, and if you wanna talk I'm down. Good luck!!",

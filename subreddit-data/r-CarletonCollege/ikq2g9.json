    "postText": "Hi guys! I am a student thinking about transferring to Carleton and I was wondering if anyone could give me a general rundown of what student life is like at Carleton as well as things that would be helpful for my application. I previously applied to Carleton for freshman admission so I was wondering if there would be some way that I could mention that to my advantage when I write my essay, responding to the prompt \"We know there are many reasons a student applies to transfer. Tell us a bit about your own story as a transfer applicant, including details on your specific interest in attending Carleton.\" Finally, any general info or tips, in general, would be appreciated! Feel free to ask me any questions!",

Carleton thrives on providing an excellent academic environment, while also giving great fun opportunities to enjoy your time with friends.\nWhat have you done during your transfer year? Do you have any examples of this sort of mindset that you could bring up?",

During my college career so far, I have spent some time hanging out with my friends doing things such as go to a game night at our residence hall as well as attend a hockey game together. I feel like I have worked hard as a student academically, but I am not entirely clear on how I would express the connection between the community and my studies. I feel like I am getting a good sense of what it is that you are referring to though.",

Have there ever been days where you felt like you couldn't focus, but your community helped you through it? Or maybe a time when you studied with friends whose connections you deepened through the hockey game? Everything is interconnected, and although it might be challenging to find the linking threads, I'm sure that it's there!\n\nFeel free to ask if you need any additional assistance!",

A challenge for me is tying the academic aspect with the social aspect since most of my friends study something different than I am, so studying together isn't really a thing for me. I do value the diversity of my friend group, both academically and personally, but I am not sure how I would link that together since as I mentioned, my friends don't study the same subjects as me. Perhaps there is a way to mention this form of diversity academically?\n\nAs for any struggles such as with focusing like you mentioned or other personal issues, I relied more on support from my family as well as faculty and other campus resources. Otherwise, I didn't experience it that much. The issue that I have is that I understand what it means to have a close-knit community, at least theoretically since that is what I always envisioned college to be like regardless of institution, but I haven't experienced that at my school as much. My school is a bit more competitive, at least in the subjects that I am interested in, which while it works well for some of my friends since they are more driven to improve that way, for me I am looking more for that cooperative atmosphere that smaller LACs like Carleton offer. \n\nFinally, are there any other resources you can think of that could help me out, like would asking Carleton admissions help? I don't want you to feel like I am completely dependent on your help on this. Thank you for your understanding!",

However, perhaps actually mention that you haven't experienced a close-knit college community and that Carleton seems like one of the most optimal places for finding such a place! Concerning academic diversity, have you ever learned anything from your friends that you feel has given you a better perception of your own studies, or perhaps merely a greater understanding of life in general? This is something that is very Carleton-esque, learning from friends who pursue different disciplines in order to come to a mutually greater understanding than the mere sum of your parts.\n\nI'm sure that you can reach out to Carleton admissions, and I'd definitely recommend it! Do you have any resources at your current institution that you could utilize too? Regardless, I still enjoyed helping you and I hope that said help is, in fact, useful!",

I was merely taking what I knew about the college, which is, as one would expect, from information sessions and admissions speeches. So on that end, it was intentional to come off as similar as those would probably be some good ideas for a transfer student who's applying to this college since those people giving the speeches would be the same ones who will be reading SuperImagination's application.\n\nI am not a spokesperson for Carleton, I'm just a standard incoming student. If anything I'm paying THEM money, after all, it is a private institution. Whether or not they listen to me is not relevant to me personally, I am merely trying to provide as much productive assistance as I can.\n\nI admittedly haven't mentioned any political leanings, so I'm surprised that you brought up such a topic when we're merely discussing methods to help improve one's chances of acceptance as a transfer student.\n\nI'm unsure who DoctorForLife is, but that user page is not providing any results; however, I do find it strange that you are injecting them into this conversation. Do you know them? As that's a very strange claim to make.\n\nI'm not on any forms of medication, I'm unsure why that matters in this sort of discussion, as it has nothing to do with my personal medical history, but there's nothing abnormal.\n\nIn addition, I'm quite confused by these last couple of comments. I don't think I discussed politics at all, you were the one who put said words in my mouth, which I would prefer if you did not, as those statements do not aptly fit my own personal political beliefs.\n\nTo conclude, I'm assuming that you yourself are a Carleton student, as otherwise, it would be quite strange for you to be on such a subreddit. Perhaps, though, if you hate it as much as your username suggests, you might want to transfer schools? You don't have to, but you seem to express vile distaste for nearly every aspect of it, including (apparently) people like myself who haven't even attended the school yet. I personally am fine with conducting productive and critical conversations with my peers, but your writings seem to suggest that the population of Carleton is not fit to discuss important topics with you.\n\nRegardless, much of this has very little to do with SuperImagination's original post, so I hope that this discussion is concluded. If you have any personal issues with anything I've written, feel free to message one of the moderators, as I would hate to further detract from providing productive responses that are conducive towards helping them get accepted into Carleton.",

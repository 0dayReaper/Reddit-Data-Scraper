    "postText": "Hey Carls, cheers from across the Cannon.\n\nI'm a first year student at St. Olaf, so far mostly having a good time. I'm not super impressed by the breadth of the CS department here and I'm interested in the wide range of electives available within CS at Carleton. Is it unheard of for Oles to register for these classes given that there's high demand for them just among Carleton students? In general, what is your opinion of cross-registering between the two schools?\n\nThanks and Um yah yah!",

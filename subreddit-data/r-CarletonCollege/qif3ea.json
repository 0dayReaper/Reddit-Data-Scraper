    "postText": "I was accepted to Carleton last year but due to financial reasons, I couldn't attend. Now I go to a a big state school and I'm honestly miserable. I can't see myself being here for the next 4 years. I was wondering if I could still apply as a transfer student and how high are my chances of being admitted?",

I'd imagine that your situation might give you a bit of an edge, since they liked you enough last year to offer admission and they may be sympathetic to the financial reasons for your declining and your finding that a large school is a bad fit. I'd go for it if I were you.",

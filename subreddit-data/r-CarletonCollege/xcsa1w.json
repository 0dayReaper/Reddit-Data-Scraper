    "postText": "I was looking into getting a bike this year and assumed that most students rented them from one of the Northfield shops. However, it doesn\u2019t seem like there are any nearby shops that rent bikes and I don\u2019t want to buy a brand new bike just for a year. Should I just look at facebook marketplace to find the best deal? Or is there another easier option.",

I guess it's been replaced by Craigslist.",

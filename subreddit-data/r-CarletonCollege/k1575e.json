Over time the number of slots has decreased and it may go away some year.\n\nCarleton does has quite a few houses where students live, both interest houses and \"draw houses\" that are part of the standard room draw. They aren't available to first years but sophomores and up can often find spots in them.\n\nThe fact is that with the exception of a very small number of boarding school folks, almost no college students have lived in a dorm before their first year. So everyone is in the same boat and you figure it out together.\n\nIt's honestly way better for your social life than living alone or with a roommate in an apartment -- you get to know 30-50 floor mates quite well, floors play ultimate and broom ball together, neighboring floors often hang out together, and eating in the dining halls together means you get to see and know other students outside of your floor and dorm too.",

Covid aside you can definitely expect to be spending more time out than in, so really it is what you make of it. If you want to avoid it then it can just be a sleeping place. If youre more of a cozy up in bed all day kind of person then you can totally customize it to fit those needs. Like just about everything else here, it is what you make of it",

It sounds like they've built enough infrastructure that they need students to live in campus owned dorms and houses. When I visited there in 2019 those houses and the new dorms looked really nice. I think you'll be fine. Mingle, socialize... You'll be fine. It's part of the Carleton experience.",

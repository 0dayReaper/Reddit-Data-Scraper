    "postText": "Our son was just accepted for Fall 2023. We are coming to Northfield this weekend and will tour campus Monday and Tuesday.  We are getting a personal tour - which is awesome - but I\u2019m wondering if folks on this sub might have recommendations for specific places to check out on campus.  Recommendations for dining and shopping in Northfield would also be appreciated.  Thanks!",

Tandem bagels and The Tavern for breakfast\n\nShopping: Downtown Northfield has a lot of neat little boutique stores. If you want large scale shopping at name brand stores etc I\u2019d also recommend swinging by Mall of America before flying out. \n\nWhile you\u2019re on campus I\u2019d highly, highly recommend taking some extra time to walk in the Arb (both Upper and Lower)",

The Arb is absolutely beautiful and I highly recommend checking it out! The chapel is what made me fall in love with the campus and it\u2019s definitely worth passing through.",

Go for a walk down along the river walk, stop at the Blast for soft serve, and maybe at the Contented Cow Pub for a drink - there\u2019s often a jam session going on. Our bookstore is also remarkably good.",

We live in NM and never pass up a chance to enjoy large (by NM standards) bodies of water. I saw the Contented Cow on Google, as well as a couple of breweries.  Which brewery would you recommend?",

The cow is better for a quiet winter\u2019s evening, or for a late summer evening overlooking the river. If you will be here on a Friday or Saturday, Martha\u2019s Pastries in Dundas is incredible.",

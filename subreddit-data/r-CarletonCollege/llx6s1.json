I looked at the my professor for a lot of the faculty and most reviews are good, saying that it's exceptionally tough but professors care about you. \n\nIs it super difficult to get A's in the department?

Carleton however has a great  reputation with law schools to my knowledge, so a perfect GPA shouldn't be the end all be all.\n\nNever interacted with a Poli Sci professor I haven't liked. Professors want you to succeed. There's a good variety of interesting courses within the department. All in all, very good!",

You\u2019ve got a wide selection of professors to choose from, and I\u2019ve taken classes with most of them, including a couple of visiting faculty. As others have said, A\u2019s aren\u2019t just handed out, they must be earned and professors are fair in their grading, including giving feedback. I\u2019ve enjoyed interacting with professors outside of the classroom too, so they are very welcoming and open to talking about your future career plans or just about life in general. \n\nThe department also has an annual trivia contest that\u2019s super fun!!! So many tamales and cupcakes and really weird prizes. Feel free to reach out with any questions and I\u2019d be happy to chat more!",

The answer varies depending on the class and how many you are taking ofc, but generally speaking you could be reading anywhere from 150-250 pages a week, more or less. That may sound daunting, but if you\u2019re taking three classes that meet two to three times a week then it makes sense. Some of these are research papers and others are book chapters too. If you\u2019re taking a 100-level class you\u2019re probably going to be reading fewer pages than if you\u2019re taking a 300-level class. The key to readings is being able to skim effectively and take notes/highlight important information for use in class discussions or papers.",

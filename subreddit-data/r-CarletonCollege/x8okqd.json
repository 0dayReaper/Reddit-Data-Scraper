Admissions wants to know that you keep yourself busy, you get involved, you can juggle multiple things at once. \n\nIt doesn't have to be just clubs - if you had a job or worked on a project yourself, put that down. Though, I will say that admissions wants to make sure you work well with others too so think of actives you've done that show that. \n\nAs to the app, just write whatever is true to you. Don't write what you think admissions wants to hear. It can be something you're excited about or something that has had a big impact on your life. I think there are actual prompts to but those change all the time and I don't know what they are this year. \n\n\nAlso FYI, Carleton (as a small liberal arts college) doesn't start students in any particular major. All students enter Carleton as \"Undeclared\" and don't choose their major until the end of their sophomore year. You should sign up for a virtual information session if you can. \n\nGood luck!",

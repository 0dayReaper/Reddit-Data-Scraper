If your idea of conservative is loudly shouting that transgender isn't real then maybe less so.",

The last republican who was comfortable actually sharing his opinions (while they were extreme and very clearly conspiracy theory based) did end up transferring because of how much the general sentiment of the community differed from his. \n\nAs one of the mods here I don\u2019t want to discourage anyone from coming to Carleton since it is such a great place. But in my opinion there are definitely other institutions where conservative values are more socially acceptable that can also offer a great education just like Carleton. \n\nGood luck in your college search/decision!",

In fact Emory was at the top of my list until I visited and my host had a blue lives matter flag draped across his wall. If I could point you towards resources I would but I just don\u2019t know any.",

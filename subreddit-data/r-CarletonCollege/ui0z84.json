As some point fairly early on in the accepted students process (I'd guess sometime in the next month or so) you will be sent info and a link to activate your Carleton account, set a password, etc.\n\nAt one time you were simply given a username but now you might have some opportunity to choose one? Perhaps a current student can provide insight on that.\n\nIn any case, once it is set up, the account will give you the ability to sign in to various Carleton systems, including your Carleton email but also things like The Hub (where you register for classes, pay bills, etc.) and Moodle (where online aspects of most classes live). The username for your account will be the same as your Carleton email address.",

    "postText": "TW: Sexual Misconduct \n\nThere have been recent Facebook posts from Carleton alums (at least a half dozen male-identifying people) sharing their experiences of sexual advances from History Professor Emeritus Harry Williams. This includes screenshots of suggestive messages from Williams offering to fly a former student out to Minnesota with there being \u201cconditions\u201d for that visit. One individual said that when they were a student at Carleton, Williams told him about past \u201clovers\u201d that were Carleton students, said he \u201cprefers straight boys,\u201d and asked the student when he would come over. Another former student said Williams asked him about his sexual orientation in the middle of class and also offered to put him up in a hotel last winter. Others also received highly suggestive, sexually inappropriate Facebook messages from Williams upon their graduation from Carleton.\n\nFrom my recent knowledge about Sociology/Anthropology Professor Jay Levi and the fact that he was [found guilty of sexually inappropriate misconduct](https://thecarletonian.com/2019/09/28/college-finds-prof-levi-guilty-of-sexually-inappropriate-conduct/) and yet remains a Professor Emeritus, I can\u2019t help but feel disheartened and frustrated because I don\u2019t see there being any real changes made. Especially, when it comes to the [flawed faculty and staff sexual misconduct complaint process](https://thecarletonian.com/2020/01/16/carleton-is-this-how-you-want-the-faculty-and-staff-sexual-misconduct-complaint-process-to-work/).\n\nThese incidents of sexual misconduct feel as if they are always swept under the rug so that by the time a new school year starts, new students have no familiarity with what has been going on, and then they are at risk of being exposed to predatory behavior. And when professors are given the Emeritus title, that doesn\u2019t fully remove them from engaging with students or the campus.\n\nWilliams was a Professor of History at Carleton for over thirty years, and almost all of the people commenting on Facebook were his students within the past several years. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the number of survivors out there that have felt alone for the past three decades and feel they can come forward now, but it also saddens me to think about the many who may never come forward or never felt safe enough to do so either.\n\nI just wanted to hear thoughts from others and whether anything will come from this. The campus is on break right now, but I can only hope that the college finds some way to address this in the coming year.\n\n**EDIT**: The former student, Sharaka Berry, who was first to come forward with accusations against Williams, was featured on a podcast. In short, the information relevant to Carleton is that Sharaka\u2019s former girlfriend filed a Northfield Police report and a Title IX complaint against him in Spring 2018. There seems to be a lot more to the story there, including a \u201che said, she said\u201d type narrative that arose after Sharaka had already broke up with his former girlfriend, and there was a previous incident of there not being clear, explicit conversation about sexual relations. Regardless, Sharaka was found not guilty.\n\nWhat I think is most worrisome is that it was Carleton\u2019s Title IX Office that recommended Sharaka reach out to Williams in the first place. This was encouraged because Sharaka, as a Black man, would be able to receive guidance from Williams, an older, well-respected Black male professor. What instead transpired was Williams told Sharaka that he needed a \u201cstrong man\u201d to guide him. \n\nI further found it problematic because it made me wonder whether Carleton\u2019s Title IX Office had recommended other men to seek out Harry Williams for guidance, only to instead be sexually propositioned. If the Title IX Office unknowingly directed students towards a professor that preyed on students, that further complicates the institution\u2019s role in all of this. \n\nLastly, I know that this is just me giving my opinion, but I just find it so difficult to believe that no one spoke about this for the more than *30 years* that Williams was a professor at Carleton. No student said anything to their peers? Advisors? Professors? Deans? How could this have been missed?",

Hopefully the Carletonian and student groups talk about it and bring more awareness. There\u2019s instances like these across colleges and it is so disheartening to see this problem seemingly baked into the fabric of academia. It\u2019s all very frustrating but I am glad people are being brave enough to speak out.",

So maybe there\u2019s a chance something can still happen in this case. \n\nI encourage everyone to email both President Byerly as well as former President Poskanzer at the very least and let them know people are becoming increasingly aware of the situation. I did 2 days ago, but still no response.\n\nEdit: To add a bit more color, found this snippet on the Carletonian FB page - \u201cProfessor of Anthropology Jay Levi has been barred from teaching Fall term following an investigation into a formal Title IX complaint, brought in May 2019 under Carleton\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy. \n\nFollowing the investigation, Levi was found to have engaged in \u201csexually inappropriate conduct,\u201d distinct from sexual harassment in college policy. Levi is expected to return and teach in Winter Term 2020.\u201d",

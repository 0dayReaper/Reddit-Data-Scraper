Could you please tell me about the environment and feel at Carleton? Being far away I would not be able to visit so it will be nice if I could have your suggestions. Is it very toxic at Carleton? Are students always studying or they have time to socialise? How are the parties(if any)? Any extra feedback will be appreciated. Thanks :)",

            "comment": "depending on how familiar you are with the liberal arts landscape, i would describe carleton as much less preppy/fratty/self-serious than east coast LACs, a little more \u201ccrunchy granola/hipster\u201d aesthetic, but not to the degree of a place like oberlin or reed. you won\u2019t see many pastel polos or vineyard vines on campus and a lot more flannels and pajamas. nerdiness levels/bookishness/~quirkiness~ would probably be similar to uchicago or reed. similar to swarthmore but people at carleton seem a bit more goofy/less chronically stressed out. i think it has a social vibe that\u2019s maybe comparable to a place like pomona or maybe haverford, but obviously the weather here is chillier :)\n\npeople care a lot about school and work hard, but are generally doing so bc they genuinely care about what they\u2019re learning and are interested in the material, so it\u2019s not at all competitive. it\u2019s the kind of place where you\u2019ll overhear people talking about ideas from class in the dining hall (and sometimes at parties lol). people like to nerd out. because of the trimester system, classes move fast and the workload is pretty intense. it\u2019s probably true that there is a not very healthy culture of stress at carleton where people are overcommitted. but in general the academic environment is really supportive and open. most professors opt to have students address them by their first names, and they tend to treat their students as actual intellectual peers rather than pupils. \n\nclasses are small; you\u2019ll get to know your professors pretty well. i was in a small department and become close with a lot of my professors\u2014we are still in touch. the biggest class i was in, an intro science, had about 60 people in the lecture and 10 in the lab with a prof. all my other classes had around 20 people. \n\nsocially, carls are generally pretty earnest and friendly. it\u2019s a small school and you get to know a lot of the people during your time there, which i think makes the community pretty tight knit. admissions loves to talk about all the quirky traditions and things like friday flowers (where you can buy a flower to put in your friends mailboxes at the student center on fridays). even though it\u2019s a little overplayed, i that\u2019s a pretty good example of the overall vibe\u2014people go out of their way to support each other and there\u2019s a sense of trust to such a degree that everyone\u2019s mailbox is unlocked. having a friend leave a small note wishing me luck on a test or just happy friday after a long week really made a difference sometimes. at carleton i never thought twice about leaving my laptop out at a table in the library while i took a dinner break and learned that in minnesota people will always, ALWAYS hold the door open for you. \n\npeople tend to assume that life in northfield is really boring bc it\u2019s a rural location, but i ended up being really grateful to go to school farther from city life. i spent more time getting to know my peers on campus and felt like there were so many events that i rarely wanted to go into the twin cities because i felt like i would miss out. plus, every event on campus is free, so i didn\u2019t end up wasting a ton of money on shopping or clubs or stuff like that. the more rural location also means that people get more creative in making their own fun, so that makes campus life more colorful too. \n\ni didn\u2019t play tennis, but a few people i knew did and they all seemed to enjoy it. it seems like a pretty small team, but they were all pretty close and hung out together a lot. \n\nhope this helps! feel free to message me w questions",

    "postText": "Hey y'all! I wanted to ask how generous is Carleton with its financial aid for intl students? I have a strong profile (4.0 gpa, perfect ranking, strong ecs etc.) but to attend I will be needing full financial aid. How likely is one to get a full ride? (I am considering applying via EDII)\n\nInformation will be appreciated :)",

Carleton's financial aid policy is to meet 100% of a student's demonstrated need based on family income status.  Admission is also need-blind.",

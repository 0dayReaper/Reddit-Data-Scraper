    "postText": "Hey - I'm a mom of an admitted student to Carleton.  My daughter is SO EXCITED! We live about 10 hours away and would love to drive up and just look at the campus and the town.  Does anyone who is in Northfield right now know if the public is barred from driving through the school? I know they are not offering tours for admitted kids right now, and there are lots online - just hoping to get a feel for the place.  Thanks in advance.",

As a community member, I know that they're discouraging visitors (they've done a great job of keeping a safe COVID bubble for students, faculty, and staff), but driving through is okay. \n\nAlso per their [FAQs for community members](https://www.carleton.edu/covid/frequently-asked-questions/faqs-for-community-members/#acc1_4), they say \"While we cannot completely close off access to outdoor campus spaces, we ask that visitors do not stop on campus. Walking through campus is OK, as long as you keep a safe distance from others and have a mask with you. Our\u00a0mask policy\u00a0requires individuals to wear masks outside when it is difficult to maintain a six-foot distance from others.\"\n\nWhile you're in town, be sure to check out Division Street (very close to campus). A big Northfield welcome to you and your daughter!",

We will be so excited to have her on campus next year. \n\nCarleton college is an open campus, meaning there are no physical barriers preventing someone to walk on campus. Carleton is not prohibiting people from coming to campus and you and your daughter are free to walk around and see the layout. With that said, you will not be permitted inside any buildings, academic or not, and you must wear a mask while on campus.  \n\nCarleton is currently on spring break so there won't be as many students here and if you do visit, the town of Northfield is absolutely lovely and I would also recommend taking a stroll!  \n\nLet us know if you have any more questions!",

And make sure you are wearing masks of course. But other than that, as long as you aren\u2019t trying to enter buildings you should be good! Carls are also super friendly and helpful if you end up lost or need directions!",

As a previous commenter said, we\u2019re on spring break right now (until the week after next) so if you want to walk around an empty campus with PLENTY of distance just to see what it\u2019s like, now is the time.\n\nIf it\u2019s important to you to see some student life then I\u2019d recommend waiting until it\u2019s a bit warmer, when that threshold is crossed there will be a lot more students out on the various campus greens (bald spots as we call them) throwing a frisbee or playing spikeball etc. Again, you won\u2019t be allowed into any buildings but as a bonus I hear the school is going to try and get everyone vaccinated sometime this spring, so keep your ear to the door and maybe the policies will change \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

We are all vaccinated, by the way.  That is excellent news that Carleton may do that for its community.",

It looks like it\u2019s gonna snow on the 28th and it\u2019ll definitely still be cold, so again if lots of activity is important then I\u2019d caution against that date. If it\u2019s not a priority, campus is beautiful no matter what time of year, and you\u2019re welcome to take a stroll around campus. \n\nAs a bonus, there\u2019s a pretty good campus map on the website, and I believe they have a little blurb about each of the buildings online as well, if you\u2019re looking to give your own tour. I\u2019m not sure about the last bit, but there\u2019s always something to be gained from a walk around campus nonetheless.\n\nAs an edit to clarify: there will still be plenty of students out and about between classes and such, but if you want the real Carleton energy, being only outdoors in winter term isn\u2019t really ideal.",

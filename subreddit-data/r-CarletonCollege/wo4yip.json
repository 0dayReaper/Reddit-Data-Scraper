            "comment": "I was an environmental studies major, worked in the Office of Sustainability, and participated in a lot of environmental/sustainability student orgs/programming. Overall, I would say Carleton is incredibly dedicated to sustainability and most recently has included environmental justice as a part of this framework too.\n\nThere are *a lot* of students, professors, and staff members who are passionate about environmental justice and sustainability. I personally feel like being environmentally-conscious is ingrained in a lot of aspects at Carleton. It could be something simple like the triple-bin waste systems (compost, recycling, landfill), reusable water bottle refilling stations, or locally-sourced ingredients in the dining halls. It could also be more engaging like taking an ENTS course on climate change and human health, volunteering to teach environmental education at a community elementary school, or interning at Carleton\u2019s student-run farm for a summer.\n\nSpeaking more on the institution-side of things, Carleton has a Climate Action Plan, which outlines the path towards being carbon-free by 2050. The College\u2019s Environmental Advisory Committee has been discussing a carbon offsets policy proposal and what that could look like for the campus. Carleton also recently completed a multi-phase geothermal heating/cooling system that has dramatically reduced the college\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nHappy to answer any additional questions you might have about sustainability at Carleton or anything else!",

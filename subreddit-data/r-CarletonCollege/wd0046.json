I could count the number of conservative students I knew while I attended about 10 years ago on one hand. This isn't necessarily to say that you should go to the school that matches your ideology; perhaps you'd be inspired by being surrounded by differing perspectives. You'll get a great academic experience at either school. I'd pick Carleton 100 times out of 100, but I'm a left-wing person who wanted to wear jeans and Birkenstocks to class.",

            "comment": "The two colleges are sort of opposites of each other.  W&amp;L has a significant frat/sorority scene.  Carleton has none.\n\nAmong the Top 20 liberal arts colleges, excluding the service academies, Washington &amp; Lee is the most conservative school.  That's Lee as in Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general.\n\nAmong the USN&amp;WR Top 20, Carleton is the second most liberal (after Grinnell) and the most liberal of the T10.  At Carleton, many people think AOC and Bernie Sanders aren't liberal enough.  Less than 1% of the student body votes Republican.\n\nBoth schools are majority-white, but Carleton has a greater percentage of people of color than W&amp;L.  About 35% of Carleton students identify as LGBTQ+.\n\nThe atmosphere at W&amp;L is more pre-professionally oriented than Carleton.  As others have noted, Carleton has a hippie, tree-huggy, social-justicey component.  In this respect, the vibe at Carleton would be more similar to places like Macalester or Grinnell or Reed.\n\nIt should be noted, BTW, that W&amp;L is technically a university (it has a law school and a business school), although the number of undergrads is still much larger than the postgraduate population.  By contrast, Carleton is 100% undergraduate.  Carleton is oriented towards the life of the mind.  It prepares you well for graduate school.  If you're planning a career in academia, Carleton would be an excellent choice.",

            "comment": "Hi there! I am a rising sophomore at Carleton and overall I would say the Carleton Community is diverse, diverse meaning that there are people with diverse/unique interests. As for the schools actual diversity, that\u2019s something that they should work on. But back to the diverse interests, you will find people there that have many niche hobbies, so I\u2019m sure that you will be able to connect with many people, just during your first week. \n\nI\u2019ll take a break from talking about the people and also discuss the academics. The classes are quite challenging and some difficult, especially the STEM classes. You have to be prepared to work, work and work some more. However, the classes are small, so you will be able to talk to your teacher and get help one on one. The prefect sessions are also great and I highly recommend that you attend. If you decide to go to Carleton, please pick your classes wisely. I made the mistake of not doing this for my last term and it wasn\u2019t fun. I\u2019d say the best thing to do is to pick the classes you need to take, and then organize them from most challenging to not very challenging. You\u2019re only allowed to take three classes (which is the standard 18 credits). You\u2019re not very challenging class can be a class that you think sounds cool or you know that you won\u2019t have to dedicate as much time to it. Rate My Professor is great to help you figure this out.\n\nOkay, back to the students. I\u2019d say that overall, students are nice. There are three sports at our school where the athletes unfortunately do not have a great reputation year after year based on what I saw this year and what an upperclassman (who is also an athlete) told me on my first week. Overall though, most sports teams are cliquey, meaning they mainly hang out with their teammates. Other than that, everyone is nice. There\u2019s not a sense of competition and it\u2019s really easy to talk to people. Now although all of this is true, I would still advise you, that if you choose Carleton, make sure to get to now as many people as possible during New Student Week and make friends during the first term. By the end of it, people have already established their friend groups. It will be completely normal for those to change as you continue your freshman year, but still try to make friends!!! \nI\u2019m going back near the end of August and I can say that the main reason I\u2019m excited to go back is to see all of my friends again. \n\nThat\u2019s all! I hope you find this helpful :)",

Doesn\u2019t seem very nice of you.\n\nI agree with the rest of your comment, if a little long-winded. Carleton has a good, supportive student culture, countered by rigorous academics in whichever field you choose to pursue.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth OP, W&amp;L was on my short list as well (a long time ago), and I couldn\u2019t be happier with having decided not to go there. 75% of their male student body is affiliated with Greek life, which if that\u2019s your thing, great. When I visited W&amp;L, my impression was I would quickly fall into a very strong \u201cfinance-bro\u201d type culture, which while can be a rewarding and fun environment for some, was not what I really wanted to get into.",

They may be great at their sport, but if they are going to a D3 school they probably aren't in it for that anymore.  I'd say the stereotypical \"athlete\" culture is pretty different than the general Carleton vibe.  So the standout athletes are probably just more comfortable with each other and thus you perceive this as cliquey.",

If you\u2019d like a less \u201cblanket\u201d like statement, I\u2019d say that three of the sports teams (two fall sports and one spring) have not presented themselves to be nice people, and I\u2019ve had upperclassman from other sports let me know that it\u2019s like that with those teams almost every year.\n\nThe cliquey statement is also true. Many athletes mainly hang out with people on their team. It\u2019s not a bad thing, but it definitely holds true and is also logical.",

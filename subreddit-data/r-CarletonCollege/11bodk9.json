            "comment": "This is a definite yes. SLAI program over the summer gives you a sense for what the classes at Carleton are like, what the dorms are like (you live in them while here) and what the social scene will (kind of) look like- - but only kind of because it\u2019s obviously more curated towards the academic + it\u2019s only SLAI students and Carl Counselors you\u2019ll be interacting with in terms of peers. That being said, if you\u2019re on the fence about Carleton being for you or not, I\u2019d say SLAI is an amazing opportunity. You\u2019ll get to get a sense of what life in Northfield is like and whether or not you like our campus and academic style!!",

    "postText": "Hello! I was recently accepted to both Carleton and Davidson Colleges. Was anyone accepted to both schools and was deciding on which to commit to? If so, how did you decide?\n\nI am an Asian female planning to major in digital media, communications, media studies, film, or something along the lines of that. I hope to go to a school that will have a good program in such fields!\n\nI have a very social personality and love making lots of friends. However, i also prioritize an academically rigorous environment, but not too competitive. I wouldn't say I am the typical \"nerdy, dorky\" student, but that's an impression I got from researching about Carleton College (in a good way!). For Davidson, I had the impression of it being more of a social place where people go out more and things like that, but I'm not too sure about this.\n\nIt would be great if anyone could give me more insight about these schools if possible, and how they decided which school to attend! Thank you so much in advance! :)",

                            "comment": "&gt;does Carleton ever feel too rural?\n\nEverybody has different backgrounds and preferences.  Some people hate it.  Some people love it.  Some people ... \"meh\".   \n Some people start by hating it, then loving it.  For some people, it's the reverse.\n\nIf  you have a sufficiently high bandwidth connection and capable computer, you should check out how the surroundings look from both the ground and air on Google Earth or Google Maps.\n\nNote that Charlotte (2.8 million) is significantly smaller than Minneapolis-St. Paul (3.8 million).  But also note that Northfield is farther from downtown Minneapolis than Davidson is from Charlotte.\n\nYou can see from Google Maps Satellite View that Davidson is part of the continuous suburban sprawl that radiates outward from Charlotte while Northfield is cleanly separated from the Twin Cities built-up area by about 10 miles of farmland.  Thus, Northfield probably \"feels\" more rural than Davidson.\n\nSomething that might be more relevant to some people than geographic isolation is cultural isolation.\n\nI'm not as familiar with Davidson College as I am with Carleton (I'm a Carleton alum), but I would speculate that Carleton is probably more culturally isolated than Davidson. \n\nFirst, as u/Some-Awareness4898 noted, Davidson is more conservative than Carleton, so Davidson probably fits in somewhat better with conservative rural North Carolina than left-wing granola tree-hugging Carleton does with conservative rural southern Minnesota.\n\nCarleton, while predominantly white, still has a significantly greater percentage of people of color than the rest of Minnesota, as well as a much greater percentage of non-Christians: atheists, agnostics, Jews, Hindus, Muslims, Wiccans, Druids, Buddhists, etc.\n\nThere's also a large LGBT community (more than 35% of Carleton students identify as LGBTQA+).\n\nFurthermore, there's also a bit of a perceived intellectual bubble / ivory tower attitude that some people think separates Carleton (and St. Olaf) from the surrounding communities, although I suspect this also applies to Davidson as well to some extent.  (This probably applies to most of the top 100 colleges and universities, honestly.)\n\nSecond, Carleton's automobile policy is rather restrictive, so most students tend to stay on or near campus (this is intentional, and was a policy that was actually favored by the students when originally implemented back in the 1970s; I'm not sure how current students feel about it, though).  There's another recent thread in this subreddit about how the bus service between Northfield and the Twin Cities was reduced.  I don't know if that's just temporary.  I also don't know anything about the transportation situation at Davidson.  Be sure to look into those two topics.\n\nMany Carleton students, including myself, were never bothered by either the geographic or the cultural isolation.  I was just simply way too busy to go off campus most of the time anyway.  When I had any spare time, there were lots of things to do on campus.  Even during break when nothing was happening on campus, I spent my time in the Library, the computer lab or in the Arb.  In any case, I was never bored, although that probably would've been true regardless of where I went to college.  As Arthur C. Clarke once said, \"a well-stocked mind is free from boredom\".",

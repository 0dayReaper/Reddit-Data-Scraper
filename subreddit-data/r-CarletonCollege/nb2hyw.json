    "postText": "Hello!! I am currently deciding between three schools and I really wanted input! I also applied to different majors to different schools because I know I want to go to Law School, however, there were so many undergraduate majors I was interested in. \n\n1. Carleton College\n- I will be majoring in CS\n- smaller, but liberal arts college\n\n2. UC Berkeley \n- I will be in the Letters and Sciences Department\n- I can graduate a year earlier due to my IB. and AP credits\n- Very competitive from what I heard\n\n3. UCLA\n- I will be majoring in English \n- Closer to home (hour away)\n- I can graduate a year earlier due to my IB. and AP credits\n\nCurrently I\u2019m leaning towards UC Los Angeles or Carleton College. I took out UC Berkeley because the high school I attended was very competitive, so I did not want to face that again at Berkeley. \n\nFinancially, both UCLA, Cal, and Carleton are all very similar in terms of how much financial aid I will be receiving).\n\nIf I could hear your input on how you decided Carleton and any helpful information that could help me decide, I would greatly appreciate it!",

Are you ok with being in a rural area. Do you like winters? Would you like a small close knit community or a large one thats in a city.",

However, as others have said, Carleton probably couldn\u2019t be more different than UCLA. If you want close relationships with professors, close advising, and a strong campus community, choose Carleton. But it\u2019s all about how you see yourself fitting here. At UCLA you\u2019ll have huge classes and less flexibility, but also you\u2019ll be in a huge city, there will be a ton of big events, and you get to focus in on your studies. Carleton has great campus life but is smaller, closer, and more interdisciplinary for sure",

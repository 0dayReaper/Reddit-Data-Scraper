You certainly don\u2019t need to be fast. \n\nTo make the varsity squad that swims at the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) championships, you need to be 1 out of 18 swimmers (18 for each gender) selected by the coaches. This is about 2/3 of the team, so a significant portion of the team instead tapers for the Minnesota Challenge. \n\nDespite being set on not swimming after high school, I\u2019ve found that the swim team has been one of the best parts of my experience here; I highly recommend giving it a shot! Let me know if you have any questions  :)",

I did my supplemental essay about how I was a part of my school's initiative to combat antisemitism among the students, and how that would translate into me bringing a sense of belonging to Carleton to make sure everyone is accepted, included, and respected. Feel free to DM me if you have more questions!",

My common app essay was about fostering a community of safety and love for queer students at a private southern predominantly conservative school. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you meant by Carleton supplements but I\u2019m happy to answer any questions",

I used some creative writing and joking conservational language. To me, supplementals are when the admissions staff want to know about your personality and why you care about the school, not your achievements. They want to see you fit with their vibe, and the Carleton vibe (to me) has always been a little playful and creative",

Carleton definitely favors strong writers (theres a writing portfolio requirement for graduation) so I would recommend making your supplements personal and passionate while ensuring that they have a purpose. Don\u2019t be afraid to be vulnerable or to lean into what makes you unique. Carleton is a small school and every student impacts campus life, so give them the chance to truly know you.",

You can ask the people in their subreddit about it: r/CarletonU\n\nCarleton College does have various events occurring on campus during the summer (or at least it did prior to COVID).  Some of these programs are connected to the college (e.g. Summer Liberal Arts Institute for high school students) while others are simply external third parties renting the campus for whatever reason (e.g. some New Age group used to rent the campus for a week each summer during the 80s &amp; 90s).  The latter will not affect your chances.  The former might make a (small?) difference if you use it in your application as an example of demonstrated interest.  But the vast majority of people admitted (both international and domestic) never attended any of the high school summer programs.",

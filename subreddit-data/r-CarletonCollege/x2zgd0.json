I wasn't a drug user though and this is my experience only. YMMV. \n\nI would recommend checking the student handbook to see if there's anything there.",

I worked as a salaried Carleton staff member for many years and never was tested, so seems unlikely student employees, who have much less responsibility than full time staff, would be tested.",

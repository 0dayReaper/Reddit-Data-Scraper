    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am a prospective student looking to apply for fall of 2023. I am also looking to maybe join the swim team at Carleton, and I was wondering if any current students here could speak to the swim team's reputation on campus or how \"cliquey\" the team tends to be, as I have heard that some of the sports teams can be like that.\n\nThanks so much for your help!",

            "comment": "I'm a current member of the swim team. You said you wanted to hear about other students' opinions but here's one from within the team if you're interested.\n\nI think we have a pretty great reputation on campus(obv biased but I think the vast majority of Carleton students would, agree). Apparently the team used to be pretty crazy/wild, but as of recent the public perception of the team is that it's made up of very nice and innocent (a decent portion of the team doesn't drink) people. Obviously we still love to do fun shit, we just make sure that everyone is able to have fun in a way that's comfortable for them.\n\nYou mentioned cliquey-ness as a concern and if by that you mean excluding ppl from parties/hangouts, there's none of that. Everyone is invited to everything, and we make it a point to  have hangouts as a full team.\n\nI also think the fact that the men's and women's teams practice and go to meets together really helps to form that sense of connectedness and inclusion too. Of course, there will always be drama that pops up(usually relationship related), but it isn't more than what one would expect from a college sports team.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions! Feel free to PM me too",

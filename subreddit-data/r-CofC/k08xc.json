We've got a lot of interesting stuff planned for this semester, and it's a chance to meet cool people with similar interests.\n\nOur first meeting will be tomorrow (Thursday, 9/1) at 7pm in Simons room 422 (take the elevator by the sculpture studio to the 4th floor, follow the big pink signs). We'll meet every other Thursday from that point forward- if you want to check if there's a meeting on a particular week, you can check the Google Calendar on our website.\n\nWe've also got a call for submissions for our Student Run Gallery (the long hallway in the Simons center) out right now: any wall-mountable work will be accepted, and the deadline is September 12th. You can submit as many pieces as you like. Email photos of your work along with titles and dimensions to cofcvisualartsclub@gmail.com. \n\nYou don't have to be an arts major or even take art classes to attend the club and submit your work!",

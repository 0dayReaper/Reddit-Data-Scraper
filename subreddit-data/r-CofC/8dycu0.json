We just need a place for our gay rager (no we are not getting naked). \nBut seriously,\nwe live in transitional housing (we are not drug addicts, we just want some cheap rent)  and we can't have parties at our place. \nIf you want to discuss the party please message me on reddit and we can plan a theme ( for our party).",

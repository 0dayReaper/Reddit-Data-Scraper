Extracurricular activities. There are four mandatory fire drills for the year and one of them has to happen at night. That being said, there *should* only be four of them all year, but there will be more if someone does something that will set them off.",

I don't know how it was in the other dorms, but when an alarm went off they would check, I think, every dorm on the same floor as the alarm because (they said) the alarm system didn't actually say which room tripped the alarm. Anyways, they always caught people with weed and alcohol this way. Be careful.",

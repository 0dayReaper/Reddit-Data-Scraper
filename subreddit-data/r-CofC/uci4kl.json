    "postText": "Hey everyone! I made this new app, called FuzeMee, that allows students to buy and sell items to other students on campus in a safe and easy way. So, if you're looking to get rid of stuff before the end of the school year (furniture, clothing, books, etc), you can list it on the marketplace. **We will match anything you make up to $100 for these last two weeks of school!!** This is the app: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fuzemee/id1532369140](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fuzemee/id1532369140)",

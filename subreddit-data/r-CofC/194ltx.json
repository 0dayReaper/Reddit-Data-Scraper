The reason it was so low to begin with was because I took a couple of semesters before I joined the military, that I completely bombed in.  I've roughly been at a 3.0 level since I've started back, but unfortunately those two terrible semesters are still dragging me down.  I ended up not applying to CoC, maybe I still will tho, I don't know.  I've been accepted into USC and a few other schools, but we'll see. ",

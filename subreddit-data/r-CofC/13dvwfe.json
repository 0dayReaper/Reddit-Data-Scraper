    "postText": "I am looking for an off campus apartment for the fall 2023 semester. I\u2019m a transfer student and had a lot of complications with my current school that led me to enrolling after the May 1 deadline for guaranteed housing. If anyone knows of a good apartment that\u2019s near the school or is looking for a roommate to split rent with, I would appreciate it.",

    "postText": "So I'm a 27 year old transfer student who is having more problems than solutions when it comes to even going to school here.\n\nToo old for student housing? Understandable, I'll find some place off campus. Off campus housing downtown is nearly impossible to find unless I want to spend 2k on a 600 sqft studio or 1k to have three roommates at the swinger bingedrink glorified dorms that are that NoMo place that keeps spamming me? No thanks, I'll live on another peninsula.\n\nSo now I have my next problem, finding a parking situation since I'm commuting everyday. I'm a new student so I can't register beforehand, which is not the best policy. The Parking Office basically told me I should've known about this beforehand (and maybe I shouldn't go here) and they can't help me find anything. I've already put in some emails I found on CofC's alternative parking list, and been put on wait-lists or denied outright.\n\nAm I missing anything? Does anyone who lives outside the city have a good system or knows of a garage close to campus that has spaces available for a reasonable price? I really need some help figuring this out.\n\nThanks so much!",

It's a bit of a pain rearranging your schedule to fit the buses and occasionally they would show up late going home but otherwise it was a good, cheap alternative to paying for a garage. Later on when I got my car I would often park on the battery and bike/scooter down to the college. ",

Remember them bc it takes a while for the city to get to them, park residential for the hour or so you have a class it's 1hr parking (used to be 2 in some areas) you will get your car \"chalked\" digitally by parking enforcement.  Grab a bike rack for your car and park down next to the ravenel on east bay where walkers park and ride over.  Parking was somewhat easier to manipulate back in my day but has def gotten worse and rent was cheaper.",

            "comment": "There's a section of 2 hour parking on Bull and Montague streets between Rutledge Avenue  and Lockwood Boulevard. I lived on James island for a year as a student and moved my car to different streets within the same 2 hour zone between classes. \n\nI will say the city may have tightened up on this loophole such that you can only park in the same zone once per day, so you may want to check with the city parking department on those rules. \n\nEither way, definitely get familiar with the 2 hour parking areas. They're generally farther away from campus, but worth it if you only need to be there for one class. \n\nI'll also echo the park at the battery and bike suggestion. I used that area all the time, different times of day, and never had any issues. Just a long walk to class/work, but a nice walk is good exercise\n\nMaybe you can find someone to carpool with? \n\nGood luck!",

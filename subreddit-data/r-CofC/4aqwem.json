    "postText": "I have applied to CofC but since May 1st is coming up time to make a decision is coming soon. I absolutely love the town of Charleston, the restaurants, the fact that its right near the beach, and the overall feel of the town. Unfortunately when I visited they were on break, but do people feel a major of the people do sororities/frats? Also are a lot of the girls the stereotypical \"southern pretty girl\" (A little bitchy also)? Just looking for an honest opinion thanks! Also I'm coming from MA, think the school has a lot of students from the south, is that an issue?",

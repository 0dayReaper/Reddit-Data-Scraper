    "postText": "I am interested to hear from either current or former students in the one year MBA program at CofC. What is the experience like, what was the curriculum like, is it worth it, etc? I used to live near Charleston, moved to Florida for a little more than a year after graduating from Clemson in 2020, and I am wanting to move back to Charleston. I think the one year MBA program could be a good opportunity for me to further my education and earning potential, as well as be a good way to get a career in Charleston started. \n\nI am also curious about the out of state tuition abatement program, since I am now a Florida resident. The MBA web page made it sound like all MBA students pay in state tuition through the abatement, but the abatement program web page says that only students offered a graduate assistantship or an eligible scholarship qualify for the abatement. I am confused. I would love it if someone could explain this all to me, as I am trying to figure out what the cost would be if I decided to try and do the MBA program. \n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm a current MBA student and I can clear up some confusion and answer your questions. All students in the MBA program will pay in-state tuition. We have international students that also pay the same rate as in-state students. The curriculum so far has been very interesting but also time-consuming. It takes a lot of group meetings and outside class time. In my personal opinion, I'm not sure if the degree itself is worth it, but the networking provided by the faculty is surprisingly good. They give you your own personal mentor/Executive coaches based on your interest and someone in the class has the ex-CEO of Lacoste, Executive Director at Amazon, etc. I would look into it and reach out to MBA Alumni, students, Ron our director (super chill guy), and Seaton (MBA Admissions), or even just message me.",

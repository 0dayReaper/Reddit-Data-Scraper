The kitchen smelled like ass so no one used it and the washing machines broke down occasionally but nothing too bad. It\u2019s very quiet and it\u2019s central so getting to class quickly is easy. I honestly loved living there as it\u2019s one of the smaller dorms and it\u2019s quiet. I didn\u2019t have many, if any problems living there.",

For me, I only had problems with dust and mold (which was fixed within 3 days of discovering it and was a small spot.) the building itself is fine. There is no elevator so you have to take the stairs (no first floor rooms). Is there anything in particular you\u2019re worried about? I lived there last year btw, like the year that just ended.",

The second floor is divided into inside and outside rooms. The outside rooms open up to a walkway and the inside rooms open up the game room. Move in/out wasn\u2019t bad for me at all. It took maybe an hour, likely less than that. They have people there to help and it\u2019s only one flight of stairs if you\u2019re on the second floor, so it\u2019s not bad. The building itself is old, so nothing is in perfect condition. However, I did see someone say that there was no hot water, this isn\u2019t true \ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. The water actually runs really hot so you have to have it on a lower setting and it never runs out.  Personally I don\u2019t think it smelled or anything tbh. Other than that, there\u2019s not really much to say about it? Like it\u2019s a normal dorm tbh. I honestly wouldn\u2019t live in college lodge as I\u2019ve heard horror stories (someone I know had their room flood in the first week). And Craig\u2019s maintenance people are really nice unlike what I\u2019ve heard from college lodge. But I also know people who loved living there. Mconnell is nice but far from campus. I\u2019m not sure about McAllister as that one was closed last year.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text. But everyone Ik who lived in Craig last year, loved it and would love there again if they could, including myself. But I\u2019d say just go with where you think you\u2019ll be the most comfortable and the dorm you have the most confidence in.",

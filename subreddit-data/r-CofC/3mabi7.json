    "postText": "Hi there, I am a high school student currently considering applying to College of Charleston. I was wondering how the fraternity rush process works at Charleston. When does recruitment occur for fraternities? Can anyone get into any rush event? If not, how does one go about getting recruited by a fraternity? How selective are the fraternities?\n\nI am from Texas, and I don't have any connections to Charleston greek life.\n\nI'd just like some more information about how the fraternity rush process works at Charleston. Thanks for your help!",

Greek life is much smaller at cofc compared to the bigger schools, but it does exist and can be quite fun. \n\nAs for selectivity, it ranges. I can't speak for how they are now, but some were very selective during my time and others were giving blanket bids to try and boost their numbers. It's all about who you click with.\n\nAlso, you'll hear other comments like the previous commenter a lot. Greek life is small and in a community like Charleston it's not strictly necessary to have a good time and make friends. That being said, if I had to do it again, I would definitely rush again. The money doesn't just dissappear, it gets reinvested and put towards parties, activities, and multiple travel weekends during the year.\n\nAttend the rush events no matter what. They are free parties and the fraternities are going to do it big to impress you.",

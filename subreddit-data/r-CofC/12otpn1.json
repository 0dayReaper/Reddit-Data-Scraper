    "postText": "im a prospective student for cofc, and the school is my number 1 choice given that staying local in the charleston area i really only have 2 options; cofc and csu. i worry though if my GPA will be good enough, as looking at the common data set and what the school looks for it seems like most are 4.0. ik ill never get to that kind of gpa tho, as currently i only have a 2.8 uw 3.2 w in my sophomore year. i have one ap class this year and am planning on doing a good bit more next year. i haven't taken sat or act yet, and my class rank isn't the best either as my school is small and on the more competitive side, with likely no more than 70 students in my whole grade and im on the lower end of that. i don't have extracurriculars either currently but im planning on picking some up. i just don't know if i should be worrying this much, how do i compare to other people who were admitted? college just means a lot to me, and cofc seems like my best bet in the area having the higher admissions rate, but even with the admission rate of ~75%, i can't help but worry. thanks.",

Also try to have your application in by the early action admissions date (usually some time in December).\n\nThe key to successful college admissions is making yourself stand out in good ways.",

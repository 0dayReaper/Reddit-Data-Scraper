    "postText": "I really want to go to college of Charleston.  Not only is it next to the beach, has a beautiful campus, and a great school, but my grandmother only lives 20min away. \n\nThe problem is I only have a 3.45 GPA, have taken only 1 AP class a year, realistically I\u2019m white (I\u2019ve heard that doesn\u2019t help) and I play golf. The one thing I have going for me is my SAT of 1260, however now testing is optional. If I use my early decision will I likely get in, in 2021? I want to use my early decision wisely, but I love this school. \n\nAny thoughts or response would be much appreciated. Thanks so much!",

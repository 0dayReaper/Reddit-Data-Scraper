On such a short term basis it won't make much of a difference, house apartments will probably be cheaper but have a few less niceties. Check the CofC class of '19 '18 and maybe even '17 FB pages and you'll have tons of postings for a summer sub-lease, that's more for living downtown though. Hell if you're living downtown this simmer and need a sublease pm me, I need to find a sublease for the summer. I'll be out early May for the whole summer.",

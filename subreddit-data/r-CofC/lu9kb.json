He's an excellent orator, and he has a way of winding information into good stories that you end up naturally remembering so well you barely need to study your notes when it's time for the exams.",

Also, if Dr. Poole is teaching 116 whenever you have to take that, then try to take him because he's a great professor. I have him for an upper level, but I have to assume he's just as fantastic in introduction classes as he is in mine. But Vincent is definitely a good professor. Unfortunately, I don't know Phillips; I believe she's new to CofC though I could be totally wrong. However, there is a small amount professors in the history department I wouldn't recommend, and I have heard nothing bad about her from other history majors/other students. I'd say you could take either one and be a-okay.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, they have taken away 101 and 102 courses, and the only reason they continue to offer 103 and 104 is because education (for history, specifically) majors can only take 103 and 104. The 115 (pre-modern) and 116 (modern) courses are specialized classes, i.e. whatever the particular professor's focus is is what the course will be on. My 116 was based around technology for instance. It's mainly a way of allowing history professors to teach something a little more interesting than the basics. It makes the professors a little happier-supposedly- though I've found that most students who aren't history majors aren't interested in history at all, no matter how much they change the courses. If you ever want to know which history professors to take, just message me. I'm a history major, so I'm a good person to ask.",

When logging into myportal I'm met with a blank error page with \"An unexpected error has occurred\" written in heading text. Is this a common problem? I see no way to fix it because it doesn't give me any information about the issue. I've been trying to relog on my pc, my phone, my high school chromebook, using different internet connections and VPNs.\n\n\nEDIT: also adding that MyCharleston works but i need to view FinAid info only available through myportal",

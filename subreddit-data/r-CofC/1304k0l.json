    "postText": "hi yall! I am fully commited to cofc and am planning out my top halls. ive seen a lot of people on instagram/roommate chats say they need 2 other girls to be at liberty with them. I am confused bc when i toured cofc, we were able to go to liberty and i dont remember it being suite style? I know that two rooms share a jack and jill style bathroom but that was it. with that being said, are there other floorplans at liberty that arent on the website or, if not, are we allowed to pick the pair of girls to share a bathroom with or is it random? thanks!!",

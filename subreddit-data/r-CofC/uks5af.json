    "postText": "Good evening fellow Charlestonians! Planned Parenthood is holding a rally for reproductive rights next Saturday, May 14th, 4-6pm downtown in Marion Square and they need your support! As you may already be aware, last Wednesday they held a rally downtown with less than twenty-four hours notice and had a turnout of over 200, so it is anticipated that this upcoming rally will be at least twice that. While this is good, the fight for reproductive rights here in South Carolina needs these rallies to be as large as humanly possible, and that can only happen with your grass roots support. So spread the word and tell your friends, family, coworkers, dentist, pets, everyone both online and offline to show up and show the politicians that we won't take this laying down! #Rally4RoeSC\n\n(This account is not affiliated with Planned Parenthood, just a supporter who wants to spread the word)  \n\n\nEdit: And now with graphics!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hx3znl8veby81.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cda2f81f1614931f5cc3694f3e8daa54d48f2066\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qq0xp8veby81.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=277424077fbf51ac95a0cdc593f842771dde2d7a",

There are deff some larger classes for the popular pre reqs but there\u2019s no crazy packed lecture halls. \n\nMost freshman classes are in Maybank and those classrooms can only comfortably fit like 35 students max. Key word comfortably.",

This has helped immensely making a connection with the professor. \n\nIf you go to class and raise your hand a few times, even if it\u2019s you don\u2019t understand something (be me: slow learner), it goes super far with the professor.",

You can actually expect most professors to know your name. Most classes don\u2019t have TAs (I\u2019ve only had one class that did) but professors tend to be really good with office hours and if the times don\u2019t work for you, you can typically get an appointment.",

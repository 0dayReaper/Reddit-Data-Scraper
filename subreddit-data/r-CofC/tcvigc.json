I've looked and only about 8% of the student population is black and it is in the south, so I just wanted to see if it would be smart to apply here. Thanks :)",

The school im at now is wayyy better. But I\u2019m just one experience out of many. Some of my colored friends love cofc. I know the actual college does a lot to combat racism. I would try talking to some people in the marketing department to see what they think! And I\u2019m sure the admissions office can find you a student to talk to :)",

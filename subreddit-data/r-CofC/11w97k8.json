    "postText": "Hello, I've been looking at CofC's catalog for a while now, and seem to have an interest in both the software engineering and data science majors. I also took a look at the other majors and even minors that are available here and looked at their required courses as well. But after looking, my interest in getting a double major in both still stands for me.\n\nThat being said, my question to whoever may know how to possibly answer this is: how feasible would it be to double major in the BS major of Software Engineering and Data Science, and do you know of anyone that has done the same or something similar?  \n\n\nThank you in advance.",

Source: senior BS CS and was thinking about SWE. \n\nCS double in Data would be my choice if I had to start over. \n\nReason is the state board (or whoever decides what programs colleges can have here can\u2019t remember which) said Clemson and USC already have relatively competitive swe programs. The only way they\u2019d approve cofc is if they added a language minor. \n\nHit me up if you have other questions about the CS dept.",

            "comment": "Hey, DS senior here. So both majors have a lot of overlapping classes that would help you out with a double major. The issue would be that DS doesn't cover software architecture class and SWE doesn't cover more math and stats.\n\nHowever, if you focus SWE you'll need to still take the following DS classes:\n\nMATH 203 Linear Algebra (3)\r  \nMATH 250 Statistical Methods I (3)\r  \nMATH 350 Statistical Methods II (3)\r  \nMATH 440 Statistical Learning I (3)\r  \nMATH 441 Statistical Learning II (3)\r  \nDATA 101 Introduction to Data Science (3)\r  \nDATA 210 Dataset Organization and Management (3)\r  \nCSCI 310 Advanced Algorithms (3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should be good otherwise if you wisely choose your electives that count for both and choose the Language Processing and World Outlooks Emphasis in DS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you choose to focus DS:\n\n\r  \nCOMM 104 Public Speaking (3)\r\r  \nCSCI 360 Software Architecture, Security, Testing (3)\r  \nCSCI 320 Programming Language Structures (3)\r  \nCSCI 392 Seminar on Computing and Society (3)\r  \n3 Foreign Language/Culture Minor Courses (9?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis also assumes you choose electives that count for both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoodluck with whatever you choose!",

            "comment": "Not in SWE but I am a junior in DS. My DS concentration is language and I considered making in a minor. It\u2019ll help you stand out and would probably overlap with required SWE minor. \n\nI\u2019ll share what my advisor told me about double majoring (do take this with a grain of salt). I planned to stay on track to double major in CS and DS but was told (by my advisor) that the double major doesn\u2019t really help when looking careers. To be fair I am not sure the exact overlap of SME and DS but I can imagine you take all the essential classes that programming careers are built off- \n\nProgramming I &amp; II \nAdvanced Algorithms \nCSCI 250 (forgetting the name atm) \n\nI ended up just sticking with DS and double minoring in my interest to feel like a more well rounded person. \n\nAll my professors have made my time in the program amazing. But be on top of your prerequisites and plan out your courses for the four years. \n\nCharleston is a great place to be!!",

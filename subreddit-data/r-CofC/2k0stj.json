Of course, I know that the film highlighted the more positive side of the trip albeit it made me want to pack my bags and paddle off right then. Funny thing is: I've never sailed. I'm into water and into tiny houses; single, no childrens. I'm looking for a sailboat right now to restore/ live in.\nWhy I'm telling you this? I have NO idea.\nGood luck!\n\n",

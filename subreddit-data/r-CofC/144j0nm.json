I was wondering whether the computer science or data science route would be a better fit for my interests? I\u2019ve heard great things about each one and both seem like good options! Thank you for your input!",

            "comment": "My best friend specializes in these two topics and has a masters degree in each, so I will share the opinion that he gave after reviewing the programs provided at CofC:\n\nThe current trend in Natural Language Processing is to heavily rely on statistical models (machine Learning, neural nets, ATC; etc.) Previously they were mostly ruled based which required a deep understanding of linguistics, but nowadays, while a strong understanding of linguistics is helpful, it is not necessary while a strong understanding of Machine Learning is. It would be helpful, but not mandatory, to have a minor in linguistics. This changes if you plan on going the masters/PhD route. \n\nEither of the three\u2014CompSci BS, CompSci BA and Data Science\u2014work; however, the one that most closely aligns with the topics you mentioned would be Data Science as it encompasses everything you would need for the future. However, you have electives available to you in both CompSci choices that would allow for you to be prepared as well. So, if you are more self driven, you could choose the CompSci route, especially if were to change your mind part way through, but if you definitely want those topics, go for Data Science. No matter what you choose, take Linear Algebra.   \n\n\ntl;dr Data Science with an optional minor in Linguistics is ideal, but both Computer Science (BS/BA) options with certain electives are sufficient. You must take Linear Algebra if you want to pursue a career in these topics.",

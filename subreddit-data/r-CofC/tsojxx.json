    "postText": "Hello,\nI\u2019m thinking about applying for Computer Science major of CofC. Probably it is t the best college for this major but I saw they have partnership with big companies like Google. If there\u2019s any student who can let me know if they got any benefits for jobs or internships I\u2019d like to know that. And also I\u2019d love to hear anything that you think I need to know",

            "comment": "Sorry I\u2019m a bit late to the thread, but I have some thoughts\u2026\n\nI just graduated last spring and I have a few thoughts. I went to COFC for my CS degree and I loved it but I think it depends on what you want to do after college (which I know is a ways away). If you want to be a Software Engineer, Data Scientist, work in computing in the arts, or CIS you should be in good shape. There are partnerships with Boomtown, Capgemini, and other local companies for internships/jobs. There is also a resume book that gets put together in the fall for CS students as an added bonus. \n\n\nBUT I left out Cyber Security intentionally from above. I currently work in Cyber and there just aren\u2019t many classes that are offered at COFC. I believe there are 2 at the undergrad level (CSCI 111: Intro to Cyber Security and CSCI 345 (mandatory for BS): Intro to Computer and Network Security) but there is a graduate certificate offered. This may not be a big deal and I may be blowing it a bit out of proportion, but I was a 4 year member of our Cyber Club and we\u2019ve had A LOT of success recently and the dept. hasn\u2019t added classes to reflect it. \n\nOverall it was a good experience and I think it depends on what you want to do after college. I just wish there were a few more classes offered for Cyber Security since it\u2019s a field with TONS of open jobs and it\u2019s a high paying field too.",

I plan to major in computer science this fall, but I generally want to pursue a career in cyber security. I have been told and understand that the computer science major still covers some of the core building blocks I would need to branch out into cybersecurity. But wonder if I will be so far behind other candidates, even with participating in the cyber club, or teaching myself missing pieces?",

That\u2019s probably the best hands on experience you can get and you\u2019ll get built up and ready for a career in cyber. \n\n\nI came in with 0 experience and I ended up leading the club for 2 years before graduating. It\u2019s possible but I definitely recommend getting Sec+ done before you graduate just so you have an intro level cert under your belt. Also, IT has student positions for Helpdesk and Networking which will greatly help with cyber experience (my VP and I both worked in IT before our current positions in industry). \n\nThis may have been unorganized but if you have any questions, just ping me I\u2019m always available to help out \ud83d\udc4d \n\nOne last thing: here is our website if you want to check out the club some more: https://cofcsecurity.github.io",

            "comment": "The CS Major and CIS majors are fundamentally similar, but if you aren\u2019t a genius in math or have a learning disability like me (ADHD) then the CIS (computer information systems) major would be better for you. In the CS major, you are required to take 4 or 5 advanced math classes as a part of your major, but for CIS you can choose 2 or 3 of those math classes and a business class to replace the other maths you\u2019re missing. This was great for me because I understand programming better than mathematics and still got the same amount of programming experience as a CS major, just a little less workload in math specifically.",

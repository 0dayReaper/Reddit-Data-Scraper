    "postText": "So, a little about myself.  I'm big on arts and music and stuff, and I'm planning on majoring in music industry.  I grew up in Charleston, so I know downtown pretty well.  My roommate also grew up in Charleston but is more the jock-ish type I guess, if I had to categorize.  What's the best option?  I was thinking either College Lodge or McAlister, but I'm open to other suggestions too.  Thanks!",

            "comment": "Berry has traditionally been the all girls dorm, but they are changing that next year. The second and third floor will be honors housing and the other floors will be learning communities (5th floor is for arts). \nThey are renovation it over the summer, completely redoing it by adding new furniture, new paint and possibly new floors. \nI've lived in Berry this past year and it is really spacious compared to the other dorms with a living area and bathroom that connect the two shared suites. The price is mid-range and is pretty decent for what you get. We also have a kitchen, study room, tv room, and laundry on every floor. Not to mention it's very close to the main campus.\nThe only down side would be the atmosphere since everyone keeps to themselves a lot; however, with the learning communities and switch to co-ed I think it will really improve!",

            "comment": "College Lodge is a HUGE \"community-style\" dorm. RAs are very involved and everyone knows each other. McAlister is more \"manage yourself\" but is way laid back, e.g. not much RA involvement. Liberty is for people who want to keep to themselves, not much interaction between students, imo. I was an RA in Liberty. If it comes down to it, Craig really doesn't suck as bad as you'd think. The RAs are super laid back. Get a historic house if possible! Are they still open?\n\nGet to know your RA. Get to know the RA of another floor/one you click with. You can get away with sooo much more that way. Just FYI. \n\nIf possible, go off campus. Everyone says \"stay in a dorm bla bla bla\" and I think maybe for the first semester, sure. But off campus has better prices and the rules suck. Join a club, you'll make just as many/better friends.\n\nIs your roommate a friend? Make sure it's a friend you're ok with not being BEST FRIENDS with. You have to like each other, you have to respect each other, but you WILL get sick of each other. Girls are worse. Ugh. So much worse. If you are a girl, I urge you NOT to room with a friend! Seriously. \n\n",

I lived in Mcallister and love it and it seemed like the place to be for me but for everyone is different. I'll add that they are probably the most different dorms on campus in the people who live there and the buildings. Mcallister being the newest and arguably nicest and college lodge the oldest(or oldest looking inside-- it hasn't been renovated in forever)",

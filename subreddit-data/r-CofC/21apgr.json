It matters that he is a confederate sympathizer because its disrespectful to African Americans that have ancestors who were slaves. \n\nI don't think it's as big of a deal as everyone is making it out to be, calling McConnell a racist and homophobic, but I'd rather have an elected official representing the values of the CofC student body. \n\nThe biggest reason I have chosen to take action against McConnell is that he is most definitely going to make the College go through with the merger with MUSC. I am opposed to the merger because our schools are completely different. CofC students chose to go to a liberal arts college, not a medical research university. ",

If your cell phone provider starts enforcing policies or makes other changes you dislike you change carriers. The same mindset applies to the College.  ",

I noticed most of the game stores in the area are pretty far away, especially considering as a freshman I won't be able to bring my car. \n\nI was wondering if anyone here knows if there is a group on campus that plays regularly, or if there are any upperclassman that I could get a ride with to the local game stores.

There's also another group that meets in the game lounge in the stern center but I don't know anyone in that group. \n\nThere definitely is a huge community for it here you'll be welcomed into it for sure :) ",

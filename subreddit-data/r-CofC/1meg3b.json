    "postText": "For all of my gamers and League of Legends fans! October 4th, the League of Legends World Grand Finals goes down. I've been hosting local parties here in Charleston for months, and wanted to do something big for World Finals, so I've rented out the Charleston Airport Holiday Inn and am planning to do a livestreaming event for anyone interested. If you aren't familiar with League, read this: http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/11/4710948/a-viewers-guide-to-the-league-of-legends-world-championship\n\nI've created a Facebook events page, which you can view here: https://www.facebook.com/events/217505745076084/\n\nIt can seat up to 150 people. In order to help offset the costs, I've decided to sell tickets for the event. As a college student, this is the only way I can cover the expenses this will incur. You can buy tickets here: https://lolcharleston.eventbrite.com/\nFurthermore, I'd like to give a huge thanks to Thomas from League Event for putting our dot on the map and for bearing with me. You can view his map, as well as the link to our event, here: http://league-event.com/\n\nThanks to everyone for their interest and advice in helping this come together. I'm still working as hard as I can to make sure this comes together to be the best viewing party possible. I hope to see you all on October 4th. Lastly, this is a NOT FOR PROFIT event, meaning any funding I raise over the investment in the venue will be pumped directly into making the party better.",

It's #4 of all the state schools behind Clemson U of SC and Citadel.  I checked those other schools, and they don't have entrepreneurship, OR they don't have it online.  I can't afford to chuck my job and move.  Finally, I'm a county away, and if I absolutely had to go to campus like for orientation, I can do it.  Clemson and U of SC are too far.",

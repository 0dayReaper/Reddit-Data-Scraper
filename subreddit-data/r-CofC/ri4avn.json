    "postText": "Hi! Im a high school freshmen and I really wanna attend CofC when I go to college! I have anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD, and my dog Crumble has helped me sense I got him back after dad died. I spoke with my therapist and she said that Crumble qualifies as an emotional support animal and that she would help me write the letter to college when it came time to apply. There are a few concerns I have though:\n\n1. It says that Freshmen can only have double dorms, but that any student with an ESA have to have a single\n2. What if I apply and the school denies my ESA request, but I'm already registered?",

I believe now there\u2019s a 6 hour limit you can leave your car there continuously now. \n\nThere are a few other spots downtown where you can park on the street for free but you gotta work for those",

Just use the trolley as well. But if you only have one class and yeeting out after, park by the newer st Phillip parking by the bistro",

    "postText": "For anyone who listens to podcasts, I started the Holy City Hoops pod last year and we just released the first episode of this season. This one features interviews with Grant Riller and Coach Grant. \n\n[https://holycityhoops.com/grant-riller-and-coach-earl-grant-preview-the-upcoming-season/](https://holycityhoops.com/grant-riller-and-coach-earl-grant-preview-the-upcoming-season/)\n\nGive it a listen/subscribe if you like it. New episodes weekly. The Cougs are projected to win the CAA yet again, so it should be a great season!",

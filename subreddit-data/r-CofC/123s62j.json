    "postText": "hi yall! I just got accepted to Cofc for pre business/marketing. I have toured campus twice and absolutely loved it as a prospective student. As of now, I am between Cofc and one other school (UNC-Charlotte) and hope to decide by next week.\n\nI was just wondering if any of yall had anything you like/dislike about Cofc that I should consider as I make my decision. I've gotten the gist of the basics but was wondering if there was any random things you think I should know from people who have been in the scene for a while (dorms, food, extracurriculars, social life/city life, classes, just anything honestly!)\n\nThank you!!",

Talking about Charleston life and not cofc in general. \n\n2.  Lots of great clubs for bizz school. Building is pretty cool too. \n\n3.  Main campus drains me now (MaybankRobert Scott Small, Rita Science buildings general area). Liked it as a freshman cause you see so many people and it\u2019s beautiful but I avoid it at all costs now. Just a cluster f. Bizz school is on the south side of campus so you\u2019re relatively safe but still have to most likely get there via main campus. Love strolling thru on a Sunday afternoon tho. \n\n4.  If you decide to live off campus as you get older be prepared to spend a fuck ton on rent if you want to live this side of the crosstown. \n\n5. Lose all motivation spring semesters because it starts getting nice outside. \n\n6. Parking blows unless you know the spots. \n\n7. May add more as my procrastination continues.",

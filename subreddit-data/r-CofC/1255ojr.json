Has anyone lived there/have any strong opinions on either?? Any and all advice is appreciated! I\u2019ll be a rising senior in college if that helps.",

I\u2019ve never lived in either but have been in both albeit drunk. \n\nYugo feels more dorm like. I was up there at like 11p on a Saturday night and there was all kinds of activity going on. Rooms look just like dorms too although you get your own room. \n\nI was at 61 a long time ago but it seemed a little more home like if that makes sense. Also pretty close to blackout drunk but that was the vibe I got. Like I said earlier it\u2019s much easier to find parking around the residential area.  Not saying it\u2019s easy but I go to the gym under Yugo and finding parking is a ho.",

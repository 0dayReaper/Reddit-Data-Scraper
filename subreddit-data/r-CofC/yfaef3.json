    "postText": "I was super excited to start here, but it just plain sucks. Theres not a lot of help even with the \u201cresources\u201d offered at the math center and other tutoring services\u2026. the food at both liberty st fresh food Co. and city bistro suck\u2026 I have heard the staff there getting into arguments and they always have an attitude when I try to be nice because I have been working food and bev for years\u2026. the admissions department put a hold on my account for registration because they never got my last transcript but i sent it into transfer resource center and was given credit for that class to be placed into the class I am currently in\u2026 before I even started school they lost my transcript 3 times. I got an email about a transfer only pre-orientation session and I called within minutes to try to do that and my \u201cname wasnt on the list\u201d the lady called me back at the end of the day and said sorry I have been taking calls for appointments all day so now im booked out 2 weeks\u2026 causing me to register late and get last minute picks on classes. The only good department was the counseling center\u2026 the math class at maybank hall upstairs are packing us in like sardines I feel so bad for the overweight person in our class bc I am struggling at 120lbs 5ft 2\u2026. The desks are so tiny in there I cant even fit my laptop on it without it creeping over the edge.",

CofC has no school spirit at all and I\u2019ve found that it appears to be a \u201c2nd choice\u201d school for the majority of kids.",

I had my maths in there and sometimes it gets hot in there \ud83e\udd72 you\u2019d be lucky if your class was in the AT&amp;T building.

            "comment": "in my experience, the honors college has been very worth it! if only takes a few extra classes, but it provides you with a lot of opportunities for jobs/internships/research etc. after your first year you\u2019ve basically completed half the requirements anyway and then it\u2019s basically one class a semester and more research/internship stuff and with something like history, you\u2019d have plenty of opportunities in charleston. basically, i think you get out whatever you put into it honestly",

Even the science nerd like me married my college sweetheart \n\n- it\u2019s city living but in a small city so be ready yo ride your bike everywhere and walk a lot. Busses are free for students if you want to leave the peninsula. \n\n- the classes are smaller so you will get to know your professor. Even see them at parties sometimes. \n\n- the honors college has students selected for lunch\u2019s with the Dean on Sunday\n\n- the athletics range from sailing to horseback riding. Take advantage of them. \n\n- the annual library rave is alot of fun \n\n- the restaurants on king st all have incredible happy hours so take advantage. You\u2019ll get a James beard award winning meal for under $15. (May have been impacted by inflation)\n\n- bring a towel and frisbee so you can lounge and get some color between classes\n\n- be prepared to get killer at corn hole",

            "comment": "They are right^ this is my first semester I am a transfer student and its been the absolute worst time. The desks are super tiny in some classes, the food and cafe staff are both shitty, they lost my transcripts 3 times so I had to pay an extra $30 to get them over to them, and more\u2026They held my account preventing me to register over this and all the classes I wanted got filled up. The math center is supposed to help people with class but they didnt open until 2-3 weeks into classes and they only have students working in there\u2026 they didn\u2019t even have it open before my first quiz in math\u2026 the students working in there are \u201cqualified\u201d for precalc but they often had to ask each other how to help me and then had to look it up online\u2026 not to mention they are in there doing their own homework so they arent giving 100% of their attention but it makes sense to me because they only pay them $10/hr\u2026 every department I came into contact with other than the counseling center was crappy tbh\u2026 before this school I have always had 3.5-4.0\u2026 I actually worked for a college helping to set up biology labs. If you are taking precalc you wont be allowed to use a calculator at all or any formula sheets\u2026 the caf\u00e9 locations soda machines are flat sometimes or they are out of the popular sodas\u2026 the list really goes on\u2026 save yourself some grief I wish someone wouldve told me before I wasted my time and my pell grant/loan money",

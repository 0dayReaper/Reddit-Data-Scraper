I've been accepted for fall as a math major. \nFavorite thing about CofC?\nLeast favorite?\nPeople generally friendly?\nDid you have any trouble making friends initially?\nIf you could go back, would you still choose CofC? Why?\nRecommend living on campus?\nThank you!\n",

            "comment": "Favorite thing is all the people here and the vibe that's just all out friendly. Add to that all the dogs and the city. Second Sunday and farmers markets and all sorts of stuff is always happening. Least favorite? Nothing really except how regimented my major is but that's strict to education majors.\n \nMaybe not trouble making friends but definitely had trouble getting out and about. I transferred here for my sophomore year so I totally get that coming from the transfer point of view. Just go out of your way to be outside and hang out with people.\n\n\n Definitely would choose CofC again. I love it here. Living on campus / off really depends on your money situation and if you know people. I lived in liberty when I started here and really didn't like it. Some on campus places are really nice though and you'll definitely make friends if you're in the halls, albeit freshmen friends. Good luck!",

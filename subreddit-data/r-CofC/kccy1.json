Is anyone unclear about his motivations? The kid who quit after he lost? On his blog he admits that RK may be protected by law. He then formats a blog post with so much bold/large/red text that it renders it unreadable. It's clear what his goal is, but is anyone convinced?\n\nSecond of all, the anonymous private Twitter account wasn't that bad from what I saw. Nothing unusual in diction or sentiment from the rest of the student population. I guess he lost the privilege of a shred of humanity when he was elected. I don't think what he did brings \"shame\" or \"disgrace\" or whatever the impeachment process necessitates. It's clear that he and VP didn't get along very well. Seems to be very clear where the \"scandal\" is coming from..",

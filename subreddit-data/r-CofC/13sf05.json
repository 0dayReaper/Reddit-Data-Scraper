    "postText": "Hey all!  I'm a current student of UCSB (Santa Barbara, California) and I'm thinking of transferring for my junior year (current sophomore).  I visited before and I really like CofC.  My main problem with SB is the poor quality of some of the teachers, which I think is a direct result of the tight budget in the state of California right now.  So are there any students here who can give me their two cents on the engineering andor teacher situation of CofC?  ",

Look up Chris Starr and send him an email and I'm sure he'd be happy to talk to you. His email I think is StarrC@cofc.edu. Dr. Starr is a good guy. ",

Charleston is working to become a huge CS area, with companies with Benefits Focus, Peoples Matter, and Blackbaud to name a few.  I have met Chris Starr and he is an excellent professor and department chair.  To find the best professors, I would advise to use websites like ratemyprofesor and talk to students to get a good idea which professors to take.",

But I don't have any experience with engineering professors.  I'm also not sure how CofC ranks in research funding or their engineering programs.  One upside is that Boeing has a plant here and seems to be constantly searching for engineers.",

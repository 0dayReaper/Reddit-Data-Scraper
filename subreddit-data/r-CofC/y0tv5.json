    "postText": "I've been looking on craigslist and newspapers, and still haven't found a new roommate.\n\nWe currently have 1 room for rent in Mount Pleasant starting September 1st. It's the Master Bedroom, which includes a full walk-in closet and vanity sink / mirror. It is a 2 story town home in Wando East. A quiet neighborhood with great neighbors. Current residents are a 22 year old male and 23 year old female. We're looking for someone who is responsible, respectful, laid-back, pays bills / rent on time, and preferably around our age. It should probably be noted that we're both past our college party years, so if you're looking for a party house, this isn't it.\n\nSo if you, or anyone you know, is looking for a room in Mt P, let me know!\n",

In college I have come to realize that the housing doesn't matter as much as the people you live with. If you get along with your roommates it'll make everything so much easier. Goodluck!",

If your not in the honors college I have heard good things from mcnonnel. Both of these are cheaper options. Lodge can be cool but its a little bit dirtier and there is usually a decent drug culture. I would advise you to stay away from liberty. Also, Mcalister is cool at least layout wise but it was a little too broish for me.   ",

I lucked out and got put with 5 other guys that were pretty clean and respectful towards being noise when another wanted to study and such. Only downside was 1 week of no hot water in the middle of the winter, and 1 week of no AC in the summer.\n\nBut I recommend after your first year, find at least one more friend and move off campus. I was just looking at the rates for this semester and people are paying $691/for the cheapest dorms and $1187.5 for the most expensive ones. And in my opinion that is a bid pricey, I paid $580 on average for rent+utilities when I get my own room and bathroom. And its only 1 mile away from campus so that is about 4 minutes on a bike or 15 minutes walking.\n\nand here is the link for the prices of the dorms\nhttp://reslife.cofc.edu/housing-and-rates/",

Lodge has only 2 people per room, but it is just a like a hotel room, so its kind of cramped. At craig you will have a common room area which is good, so you wont have to be in your room all the time. So Lodge would be the place for a single roommate.",

So if you had a visitor the 3 meal a day one (or maybe 15 a week.something like that) wont let you scan for the other person which really sucked, the cafeteria costs $8 or $9 for dinner if you dont have a meal plan.\n\nI had the 3 a day one first semester and ended up wasting a bunch of meals. For a really rough estimate, we are in college for 3~4 months per semester. I got the 100 meals the second semester that came with some dining dollars (lets you scan your ID to eat at the other college locations aside from the cafeteria and the hungry cougar, your parents can add money to this card also if needed). And that was enough for me, if you want to be safe you can get the 175 meal block plan. Just so you know, unused meals dont roll over which is ridiculous because you payed for them :/.\n\nif you have more questions feel free to ask, its the end of the semester and I have nothing better to do lol",

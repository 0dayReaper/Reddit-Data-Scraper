    "postText": "Hello! We are a group of Temple University students conducting research on different technology platforms and how we interact with them every day. The study is centered around young adults, age 18-24, and there are no limitations to geography or occupation. The survey below will take you through some questions about your lifestyle, technology usage, and opinions on technologies. It should take around 5-7 minutes to complete.\n\nIf you are interested and willing to participate, please complete this survey before Monday, October 28. Individuals that qualify and are interested in participating in follow-up research, will also be entered in a drawing to receive a gift card. We appreciate your consideration and thank you in advance for your time!\n\nLink:[ https://forms.gle/mje5hGh83tUarXgL7](https://forms.gle/mje5hGh83tUarXgL7)",

She says she was so surprised and interested in the general architectural differences between cities in England and cities here, especially Charleston with its older (relative to the rest of the US) southern houses and buildings. \n\nShe has only been here for a couple of weeks but she says Charleston is quickly becoming one of her favorite places she's ever been much less lived in her entire life. Funny moment in class when she learned that the United States had no castles she was very surprised which is what started our talk about architectural differences between the two countries.\n\nIf you have any general questions about Charleston from someone that is an American I'd be happy to answer them as well, especially helpful that I'm relatively new to Charleston as I transferred here from a school in Massachusetts in August",

Do you think its worth paying more for a single room there or should I pay less and get a roommate?\n\nI've seen some people say that greek life is a must. Is that true? We don't have greek life where I currently study so would you recommend it?\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

If you are at all interested in American history, this is the place for you. Because Charleston belonged to G.B. for so long, it was in the center of almost every major historical event in the U.S.\nThe people, I have found, are fantastic and I would suggest getting roommates but the dorms are apartment style, so you will probably have suitemates anyways if you choose to pay for a single room.\nGreek life can be super fun and fulfilling but it does cost money and it takes up a lot of time. It's a huge commitment but if you get in touch with someone apart of it they will probably be able to give you some better insight on the matter. I have not joined a sorority but my friend has and she absolutely loves it. It's how she met all of her friends and her current boyfriend.",

The campus is dead center in the city with great restaurants and shops very nearby (King Street), and an awesome park just a block from the middle of campus. \n\nThere is always something happening nearby or on campus from outside events to college sponsored speakers and much more. The surrounding neighborhoods of the college are all very nice and the suburbs off of the peninsula have great places to do things in (such as West Ashley, James Island, Mt. Pleasant). This is all not to mention how great the beaches are, as close as a 15 minute drive. I suggest Folly, Sullivan's, and Edisto as my favorite beaches.\n\nI think paying less to get a roommate would be the route I would go for. It would be a good way to make friends on campus but I also highly encourage you to get to know people in your classes and around campus at events as well.\n\nThis is the one warning I have for you. The greek life in Charleston is particularly dangerous. There have been a lot of sexual assaults and multimillion dollar drug busts in recent years. Some of my roommates were in a fraternity that got kicked off campus last year for drug use and this year they were completely disbanded by their national organization for sexual assault charges against two members. I would suggest not getting involved with any of the frats, not to say all of them are bad but the majority are unsavory. It is much better to make friends with your personality than to pay for them with membership dues. Some of their parties can certainly be fun and I've attended several but I tend to stay away and stick to non-greek parties. \n\nhttp://www.postandcourier.com/archives/cocaine-pills-and-textbooks/article_771357b4-42aa-5bc8-bfe8-6af658c1073d.html\n\nhttp://www.postandcourier.com/archives/sobering-reality/article_40bce42b-dcd8-528a-a1fb-2c09708ec8da.html\n\nhttp://abcnews4.com/news/local/cofc-frat-suspended-after-sexual-assault-reported-to-police\n\nHere are some articles about the recent frat troubles. This is the only aspect of the college I would say drove me to indifference. Thankfully the college and the Charleston PD have dealt with much of these problems. But I promise you that if you choose to come to Charleston for a semester you will have the absolute time of your life and will definitely want to come back as soon as possible. I find myself feeling that way every time I have to leave for any multi-day obligation.",

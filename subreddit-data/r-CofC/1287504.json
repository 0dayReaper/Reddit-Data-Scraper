Lots of clubs to choose from as well. The professors really try to help us out with events and such. \n\nI\u2019m BSci and I think it\u2019s the way to go if you don\u2019t have something particular in mind. \n\nI\u2019m senior currently.",

Applications were fairly easy and interviews weren\u2019t too technical at all. \n\nMy other friends are kinda waiting last min which I wouldn\u2019t recommend. \n\nI\u2019ll be done in \u201824 and I\u2019m not too worried at all. Internships have been a medium struggle for me but I\u2019m getting interviews. \n\nThere are huge defense companies here that are always hiring. It may not be a MANG job but do it for a year and your resume looks great.",

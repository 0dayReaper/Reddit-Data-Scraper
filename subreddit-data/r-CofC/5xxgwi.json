            "comment": "Caveat: I graduated regular physics in 2007, so take my information with a grain of salt.\n\nI loved the physics program at CofC. The teachers were great (better than at my highly regarded graduate school), and the whole thing was very student-focused. For a relatively small program, I had a lot of freedom to choose my elective classes, and even a few beyond that. I don't really know how it looks on a resume, because everyone pretty much talks about my graduate degree, and as soon as you do something other than undergrad, that's what people will talk about.\n\nAs far as graduate school (if you want to actually go into astrophysics, you'll probably need a PhD), I've heard that letters of recommendation are more important than school choice. So make sure that you find a few professors who really love what you're doing, but thanks to how small the program is and how involved the professors are, everyone in the department should at least be aware of you.\n\nA generally forgotten aspect when you're looking mostly at the academic side is everything else. It's a liberal arts school, so your gen ed requirements are going to be probably more significant than some other schools, but as annoying as that is, I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing. It's good to at least be aware of many things outside your main subject of interest to make you a better person in the long run. And the city itself is a pretty nice place to go to college, so you'll probably have a lot of great experiences from that as well.\n\nGiven the choice to do it all over again, I would 100% make the same decision. But don't take my word for it. Go visit, talk to the professors, and see if you like the atmosphere.",

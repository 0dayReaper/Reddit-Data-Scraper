With Amazon Student you get the following:\n \n* Free two-day shipping\n \n* Amazon Video (Meaning Yes, Mr. Robot)\n \n* No minimum order size\n \n* Upgrades to 1-Day shipping for $3.99\n\n Also, this is a 6 month trial. After 6 months, they will immediate charge you $49 (50% off) and upgrade you to full Prime automatically; However, you can easily call customer service and have them refund you should this happen.\n \nDon't have a .edu email address? Not a problem! Just register at a local community college without signing up for any classes. You get a free .edu email address, and it cost nothing.\n \nSorry Canada &amp; UK, I believe this offer only extends to .edu emails whereas Canadians use .ca emails and UK-ians use .ac.uk.\n \n#[Referral](http://a.co/81LhWET)/[Non-Referral](http://a.co/81LhWET)\n",

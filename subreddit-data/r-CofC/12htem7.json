CofC isn\u2019t a super big Greek school but it has a presence. \n\nWarren is nice. Rooms felt the largest to me out of all the dorms. It\u2019s also in a good area if you\u2019re into the bar scene. It\u2019s also 2 blocks (small) away from main campus.",

Plus it\u2019s right next to King Street if that\u2019s your thing and close to City Bistro dining. Overall good spot, I can\u2019t think of anything I disliked about it.",

Also, it built a lot of character for me going into my adult years. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely not easy, but so worth it! \n\nEdit: if you have any questions just ask!",

I didn\u2019t take it personally though, so it was fine. You\u2019re not going to like every person you talk to, or every house. Some people just suck, whether they\u2019re in a sorority or not. \n\nThe one I ended up in couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. Also, sororities are so big, and it\u2019s not like you have to be friends with every person in the sorority to be in it. You\u2019ll find your people.",

The most important thing I learned was, \u201cyou get what you give\u201d. If you give a lot (time, patience, understanding, perseverance) you\u2019ll learn a lot in the end and it\u2019ll help you as a person. You\u2019ll also become really close with people you never expected.\n\nI think it\u2019s hard to be in a sorority because several things about it will challenge you, but promote growth.",

Due to the size most people know each other and you end up having a pretty good repertoire with a few professors as well as you will take several classes with them. So basically, laid-back but well-respected in Charleston, i.e. it won't be to difficult to find internships and prepares you for most careers. Math department is generally good, but some professors can be hit or miss. Don't know too much about it though. Also depends in what your interest is in too. If you want more research opportunities by all means a bigger college like UNC would be a better fit. Also probably more resources and a great program as well. ",

    "postText": "Today is the the day! During every Cougar Countdown the lutheran campus ministry hosts a hot-dog cookout on Rivers Green. We 'officially' start at 5, but we'll probably start grilling around 4:30.  \n \nWe should have some chips and fresh fruit available as well. I think we'll also have some veggie dogs available.\n \nAbsolutely free, just our way of cheering you on during exams. So come on by and grab some food. ",

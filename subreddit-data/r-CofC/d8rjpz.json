    "postText": "Hey y'all,  \nI'm a history major at CofC and I'm looking for some extra income and to share my love of history (things are really rough this month, I just had to cough up over $2k for a new transmission). If anyone would be interested I'd be happy to set up a time and place (probably Addlestone or Stern honestly) and I can start helping y'all with some history stuff.   \n\n\nIn addition to history stuff, I can help proofread and edit your history essays and papers as well as helping to analyze texts that you may not be getting or just helping with general issues relating to your history class.\\*   \n\n\nI can be flexible on my prices if anyone is bound to ask, but I'd prefer at least $10/hr.  \n\n\nIf you're interested, let me know!",

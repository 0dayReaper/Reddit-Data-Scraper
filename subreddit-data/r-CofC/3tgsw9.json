I was involved a few years ago at the one in Clemson and would like to start again at CofC. If anyone has any info/recommendation/dislikes/whatever please let me know! Thanks",

            "comment": "I used to be the GM of CisternYard Radio (I graduated a few years ago)!  It's an amazing organization, but probably way more low key than you are used to at Clemson.  I'm not sure if Clemson's still broadcasts on the actual FM radio, but I know it did at some point.  CofC's radio has been internet only since before I was involved with that, so keep that in mind.  If you're cool with the internet only thing, CYR gives you some amazing freedom to do some pretty sweet shows, help with lots of great music events, get lots of free tickets, etc.  They always have interest meetings.  I highly recommend finding their facebook page and/or Twitter because they have a really excellent social media presence and are good about advertising their events.  If you have any other questions about the radio I can definitely help or if you have a specific question I can't answer, I can ask the current GM! ",

I have never heard of the Stern Center Food Court before, it is not listed with the other dining halls. So I do some digging. For three hours I search the Internet looking for anything I can find about the stern center food court. The last post I see referencing the Stern center food court was made in 2018. After that nothing\u2026 food courts don\u2019t just disappear. What the hell happened to the Stern center food court?",

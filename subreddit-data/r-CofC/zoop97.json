    "postText": "So i\u2019m like 90% sure I\u2019m going to attempt to get my dog registered as esa for my anxiety. The main thing holding me back from doing so is I have questions about the dorm situation if I do so. My top choice for dorms would be Warren and if i\u2019m not mistaken that\u2019s 4 people to a dorm and i\u2019m wondering if I could still live there if I have an esa or am i required to have a single dorm?",

The only way one can get and ESA is if you are disabled and shave a letter from the doctor who is treating your disability. I am not saying you don't qualify for an ESA but if you are just trying to get your dog into college you are making it near impossible for the people like me who can not function without their service dogs . If you have any questions feel free to ask.",

I do understand that my post probably didn\u2019t make that clear but that\u2019s the reality and I also know that there is no official esa registration and that I just need to go through the school do so, but thank you for that information as well.",

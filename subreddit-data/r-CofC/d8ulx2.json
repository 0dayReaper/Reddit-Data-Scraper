Would you recommend it to someone who has yet to leave high school? Why?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a junior here. It\u2019s a good school. Everyone here is super nice and the teachers I\u2019ve had actually want to teach you. Some of the classes may be difficult based upon what teacher you get so it\u2019s best you look up professors but that\u2019s given for just about any school. \n\nLiving off campus in combo with having a job makes it hard to really get to know people but I\u2019ve joined a club (insert shameless plug for our esports club) and met a ton of awesome people.\n\nThe only downside I could see is the fact that it\u2019s in the city so you have to deal with a lot of outsiders when you\u2019re walking. (And parking costs a pretty penny) Other than that I love it and I\u2019m glad I chose it over USC-Columbia",

And i\u2019ve looked at housing options already and am thinking of living in a hall like Joe E Berry or something (since i\u2019m thinking of living with 3+? people, and the rate split amongst a few dudes isn\u2019t all that through the roof). Also, ironically, I love the city but am a huge introvert lol",

CofC is a great school and I had a wonderful, but sometimes stressful, time there. College is hard! It\u2019s good to be in a place where you\u2019re comfortable and supported. My professors were all incredibly supportive and truly shaped my experience. I have a history degree and German minor, so I can\u2019t speak to graphic design. But I don\u2019t think you can go wrong picking CofC. It was my first choice and the only place I really considered. \n\nI really think it has a lot to do with your personality and what you want to get out of your college experience. But keep in mind, your experience is really up to you. CofC can be a bit of a party school, but if that\u2019s not your scene then it\u2019s easily avoidable. It\u2019s my honest opinion that there\u2019s something for everyone. Downtown is beautiful and keeps you active. Exploring is great for your mental health when you\u2019re stressed. It\u2019s a fun place to be but you\u2019ll learn a lot and be challenged everyday. It\u2019s a small school and, at least as of 2014, class sizes were never bigger than about 120 and that was very rare. Most of my classes were 15 or so students. If you haven\u2019t visited and spent time there, I\u2019d really recommend it. If you apply and are accepted, I\u2019d encourage you to go to accepted students weekend (if that\u2019s still a thing). Good luck with everything!!! \n\ntl;dr it\u2019s a great school with something for everyone, highly recommend!",

            "comment": "I graduated in '12 and I think I'd still recommend it even though I've changed a lot since those days. It had a reputation as a party school when I was in high school but I didn't drink for years when I was there and I made a lot of friends who didn't drink. I got into undergrad research and they had some really great professors that helped me get a job quickly after college. Even though I eventually changed careers I think it was a good experience overall. I will say Charleston is a lot more expensive and busy than it was in 2008 and that was the main reason I moved in 2015. Rent and utilities will be very high. An old buddy of mine did the computing arts degree the first year they offered it and he spoke highly of it at the time but I think he ended up elsewhere in computer science.",

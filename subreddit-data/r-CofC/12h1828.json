If not, Berry is right next door and mid. College Lodge is old af but a vibe. Liberty rooms are small imo but it\u2019s a dorm so duh. McConnell is pretty standard. They are all in prime locations. \n\nGreek life isn\u2019t huge at CofC but if you decide to rush, it\u2019s pretty chill. \n\nSource: Senior comp sci.",

That\u2019s what\u2019s most important right?\n\nIntro class CSCI 220 starts off in python. 221 switched to java and most other classes stick with java since it\u2019s one of the most widely used oop languages. C and assembly is used for the computer architecture classes. \n\nThe cybersecurity club is pretty big here and would help you if you\u2019re interested in IT. Also I\u2019m currently taking Network Security class and it\u2019s one of my fav so far. Lots of IT related stuff packed in. \n\nWatch some YouTube vids on python and java to get yourself familiar.

            "comment": "I double majored in French and Sociology and found the profs and classes to be amazing. Especially in sociology, I had tons of really practical knowledge and experience before getting a real job. I felt really prepared for the real world after CofC. Also, I loved that it was liberal arts and forced me to take courses in all subjects. I never would've found sociology if I hadn't been forced to try it. Of course I know some schools are \"ranked\" higher, but I kind of take it all with a grain of salt. What other schools are you considering? Do you think an employer will really look at a degree from the other school and a degree from CofC and find one is worth more than the other? Maybe... If the other school is Ivy League or something... But it's probably not a huge factor. I think your practical experience will be more important (I worked at the school's Career Center so I have sooooome idea of what employers generally like I think). That's just my opinion, hopefully it gives you a new perspective!\n\nAlso used to be a tour guide. About 20% of students are in Greek life. A pretty sizable number I think, but not so big that it's in your face all the time. I wasn't involved with it, but still managed to make tons of friends because we had so many awesome clubs. So I think it's a good percentage for both sides (if you want to be involved and if you don't).",

The reason: there is little to no  research going on at CofC, so the teachers are hired based almost entirely on their ability to teach rather than their ability to do research (which is a much bigger money-making opportunity for the school, not to mention the reputation boost publishing gets them). So keep that in mind.",

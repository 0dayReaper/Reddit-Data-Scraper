    "postText": "Hey guys, I am supposed to be going to cofc this fall, but my grades have REALLY been slipping. Right now I am failing two classes, Calc for the quarter, and AP Computer Science for the year. I do expect that my calc grade will rise to passing before school ends. But I am worried about computer science. What will failing this class risk?",

I am pretty sure I was in about the same situation as you, in one of my classes I had a terrible grade and I think I did fail another one my senior year. As long as they do not prevent you from graduating or turn your great GPA into an absolutely horrific GPA (Which It wont) you'll be fine.",

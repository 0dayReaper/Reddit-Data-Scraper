I thought you guys would be the people to ask about getting down.  \n\nAny recommendations or suggestions would be appreciated for efficient, cheap, easy, or fast travel.  I will be happy to pay in karma\n\noh, and how is school going for everyone?",

            "comment": "This might sound horrid, but a fairly easy way to get down here from up North is Amtrak. They have a track running directly from New York all the way to Florida with a stop in North Charleston. If you book in advance, you normally pay in the $100 range. Though it is a long ride, you don't have to worry about anything besides feeding yourself and getting off at the right stop. Only thing is that your friend will have to pick you up from the train station since it is a good 20 minutes and a trip on the interstate away from downtown.\noh, and school is going great :)    ",

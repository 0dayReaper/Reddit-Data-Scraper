Just make sure to talk to people in your class, or while grabbing food. \n\nAlso, if you befriend someone in the dorms you can go hang with them and meet everyone that they know. That'll probably be the quickest way.",

If you\u2019re good at people you should be able to make friends easily. Everyone is super nice here. \n\nLucky my high school friends are still hangin in there",

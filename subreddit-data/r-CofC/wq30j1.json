    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m thinking about applying to Charleston and had some questions if anyone was interested in sharing. Even answering just one would be helpful! Thanks :)   \n\n1. How is the school spirit\u2014 football games/basketball?  \n2. Are there a good amount of tailgates/darties? Do you need to be in Greek to go to them? \n3. How big is Greek life? Would not rushing put me at a disadvantage there? \n4. Are people generally nice there? \n5. What sports/clubs are popular/did you join? \n6. How did you make most of your friends here?  \n7. What are the weekends like party wise, frats, bars, is partying popular? \n8. I\u2019ve heard the student culture is the preppy, southern type. Is this true and could you describe more in depth what it\u2019s like? \n9. How big is the campus? What surrounds the school? \n10. What was the one thing that made you want to come here?",

            "comment": "1.  No football team but the bball has made it to March before. Games are fun. Also the baseball team is pretty good and it\u2019s fun to go catch a game. \n\n2. The college is located in the middle of the city so no real tailgates except like going to one of the horse derby\u2019s out of town. Dartys on the other hand are plentiful. This is a party school. \n\n3. Greek life has gotten bigger over the years but I\u2019ve chilled at frat/soph parties with no problems. By no means do you need to be involved in greek life to have a good time here.    \n\n4. Vibes are usually really good. No problem meeting new people in classes and starting study groups or searching for dartys. \n\n5. There\u2019s a ton of intramural sports you can participate in. Basketball and soccer are big. Depending on what you want to study there\u2019s tons of active clubs. \n\n6. First time at cofc; mostly dorms/fresh classes. This time around I\u2019ve met all my friends in classes. \n\n7. Bars are very popular. House parties are abundant. Legit walk down the 3 streets that cut through campus/dorms and you\u2019ll find huge groups of people partying or going to a party. Very walkable to find a house party or hit the bars. I\u2019ve been out of the house party scene for a min but I see them constantly. Cofc is known for partying heavily. \n\n8. Depends what you\u2019re studying. I\u2019m in comp sci and it\u2019s really diverse. I did business my first time around and it was deff a little oreppier vibe. STEM programs are a little more diverse I\u2019ve noticed. \n\n9. Campus is prob no bigger than 1 NYC block and that is really pushing it. It\u2019s very walkable. Some buildings are a littler farther away (comp sci) but it\u2019s a 5 min bike ride from main campus. City surrounds campus. Campus is legit in the middle of the small city center.\n\n10. First time around I just wanted to get away from my home city and the snow and ice. I knew a few of my friends older siblings went here and really fell in love with the small campus, weather, and overall chill vibes. This time around I wanted to get a comp sci degree from a good program and I already had a lot of electives/classes done. Teachers are great and class sizes are small. \n\nLemme know if you have any other questions. Again it kinda depends what you\u2019re studying but this should be a good start.",

    "postText": "I'm an accepted student transferring this fall from Middlesex County College in NJ. I'm excited to be a Cougar but I'm having some problems with MyCharleston. I'm working on getting  my financial aid straightened out and from what I was told over the phone it seems I'm missing a tab on mycharleston page. Would anyone be so kind as to upload a screenshot of their account, so I could compare? Blurr out any sensitive information...but anyway, It'd be most appreciated.\n\ntl;dr - I need a screenshot of a regular student's MyCharleston page so I can see what's wrong with mine",

The financial aid department sent me an e-mail with instructions to follow and I kept getting the same error. So I sent them screen shots of what I was seeing on my end, and they still kept sending the same e-mail with instructions. Finally, I just went into the office and they told me the issues I was having had never happened to any other student before. (yeahhh) So maybe you just need to go to the office. I don't know when you're visiting, but e-mailing them is ridiculous, and I don't even know why they have phones. They never answer or return voice mails. ",

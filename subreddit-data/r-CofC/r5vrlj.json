Adjuncts keep the system afloat. There are yes a few that do teach one class a semester while working a full time job. However there a also quite a fair few that are deserving of an instructor role that instead are paid just a few thousand dollars a class.\n\n\nEdit: nvm looking through, full time professors get paid huge money. Probably a mix of that and everything else. Somewhere they\u2019ve gone completely overboard in their spending.",

Administrative costs that don't contribute to teaching are one of the main reasons why college tuition increased at the highest rate, second to health care. Perhaps the money that goes into the administrative bloat could instead ~~by~~ \\[be\\] allocated to adjunct professors' pay and provide some benefits to assist them. There is no need to have a vice president, vice president provost, vice president associate, etc.",

I know it takes a lot to get some professors for some fields but paying someone 70k-130k a year to teach two classes a semester and publish a paper or two seems hard to manage. It may not sound like a lot of money for their education but I have on a little bit of anecdotal evidence that professor salaries have gotten way larger (accounting for inflation) than they were years ago. Could be wrong, I\u2019d like to look into it more. It\u2019s probably a million different things but 13 grand a year for instate is fuckin insane",

There are low-to-mid administrators that we have to take into account for the bloat. -- Their salaries and benefits add up. How many administrators (outside of faculty) do we possibly need, and are they necessary? And professors do much more than just teaching and getting papers published, which is difficult to do nowadays especially when aiming for high-tier publications. They have to construct the curriculum (e.g. select relevant readings and map them out throughout the semester) and have the course approved by the department, grade and provide constructive feedback for each assignment, paper, project and test/exam (and just imagine if there are 50+ students in the class -- Yikes!), complete grant applications (because they're responsible for bringing money to the university), and so much more. Professors' salaries are justified, I believe.",

There are professors that go balls to the wall and teach 4 classes a semester and publish a book every year who deserve every penny but there are also some that teach 2 online classes publish virtually nothing and get paid six figures.  But honestly it\u2019s probably neither admin or professors getting bloated salaries it\u2019s probably just students having thousands of dollars of east loans at their disposal and colleges spending oodles to make college a theme park.",

But the reduced tuition plan only applies to three universities: Elizabeth City State University, the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, and Western Carolina University. - All are not competitive. If something similar were to be implemented in SC, I don't think the tuition plan would apply to Clemson, USC, and CofC, since other universities in South Carolina that are less competitive are in dire need of more students and would greatly benefit from having the $500 in-state tuition plan to attract more students.",

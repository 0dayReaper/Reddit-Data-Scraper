    "postText": "Hi! So i\u2019m going to be a freshman this upcoming year and I am in a long distance relationship. I was reading up on the rules and it says that you cannot have an overnight guest more than 6 times a month. It said that this rule should still be followed even if your dorm doesn\u2019t have a front desk but I was wondering if there will be a way to get around this if possible. I ideally would like to live in Warren and if not Kelly would be my second choice. I already have 3 roomates who I know do not care about him visiting so that isn\u2019t an issue I was just wondering if there\u2019s anyway around that rule or no (or if Warren and Kelly have front desks but I think they do)",

As long as you\u2019re polite and you make sure to sign the guest out when they leave the whole \u201c6 nights a month\u201d thing is not enforced by the RAs. I had no issues when my gf would spend the night 10+ times a month. You\u2019re chilling",

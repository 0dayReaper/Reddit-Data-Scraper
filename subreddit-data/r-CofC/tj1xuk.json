    "postText": "hey! im a highschool senior who\u2019s been admitted to cofc for the fall 2022 semester as a biology major, and also into the honors college. cofc is near the top of my list, but i just recently learned that the school is about 75% white, and only about 8% black. as a black male, diversity is really important in a school. \n\nso these questions is for all people of color who are currently at the school. how has your experience been? have you felt isolated or have you felt like you stood out? have you experienced any type of racism? were you often the only person of color in you class?\n\nthanks!!",

            "comment": "Congrats on your acceptance! I graduated with a bio major in the class of 2018 and you\u2019re going to love the bio professors. As a fellow minority, I would say yes the school is mostly white. But I do see diversity improving, especially when I went there with the emphasis on getting more minorities to come to the school (diversity program). \n\nI visited campus last month (well the city but walked through campus once for the nostalgia) and just walking around, I did see more minorities on campus. \n\nThe percentage of minorities didn\u2019t bother me much because I grew up in a mostly white neighborhood and just never thought about it, but if you\u2019re looking for more diversity, CofC may not be your best choice. However the school is still great and you will not feel left out. I know there were a couple of black fraternities that my friends were part of and loved. If you have any other questions, feel free to message me.",

The population size is right around 200, so it's a small community, but a strong one. The price is nice as well. It's definitely old and kind of crappy at times, but that doesn't ruin it for me. I'm currently an RA there and have been for three years, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask!",

It's a pretty unique chill place but it is a different crowd than the typical always drunk cofc(er). But lodge always has great pot. ",

I really like the people and the community that Lodge offers, but sometimes the building can be a bit shitty. For example, because Lodge is such an old building, we've been doing construction/renovations so I wake up to drills and saws at 8 am, the hot water goes out sometimes, the paint is peeling off the walls and sometimes the heat or air conditioning stops for like a day. But all these things are just little things, and I'd still really recommend Lodge as a great underclassmen dorm! ",

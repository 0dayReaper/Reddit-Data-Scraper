                            "comment": "1) I slacked off hard in high school, which I really regret because college is basically time management and otherwise it's easy as heck, but I had A/B's in High School with mostly A's. I don't remember what my GPA was there, but it was probably in the 3.5ish range.\n\nI got an 1170 on the SAT. I was preoccupied with everything except taking that seriously, so I wish I had taken it over and tried to improve my score. I didn't take the ACT.\n\nI also didn't have all of the foreign language requirements. I think CofC wants 3? I only had 2. Overall, I had pretty good reasons in my opinion to think I'd get turned down, but I got accepted!\n\n\n\n\n2) The dorms are pretty nice. I live in McAlister as I personally only like it (not that there's valid reasons for me to dislike the others, I just wanted McAlister or to live off campus haha). I've been in Berry (the all female dorm) and Liberty. Those are both nice. If you're a guy, obviously you won't be in Berry, but Liberty's not too bad. It's right on top of one of the dining halls, so a lot of people sometimes complain about the smell since they get to smell food from 7 in the morning to 9 at night. Craig is literally in the middle of campus, but I've never been into the dorm building itself. McConnell is really far away, but my roommate has been there and he said it's cool. Lodge and McConnell probably have the most \"community\" aspects of it from what I've heard.\n\nAs far as McAllister, I like it. Most people move off campus after freshman year, but that's not really because the dorms suck or anything. There's so much to do in Charleston and I personally don't like having all the rules and stuff of living in the dorm. (Rules that are obvious, like partying). \n\n\n\n\n3) The ratio is true, and it is noticeable. In some classes you'll have, the ratio will be closer to 50-50 or not so obvious, but when you're walking around campus you'll see it a LOT. \n\nEhh, sorry I can't get it spaced out. I suck at formatting on Reddit. What dorm hall are you wanting to stay in?",

I have a few older friends who all recommend Mcallister so that's most likely what ill be going for. I love Charleston so I feel like anywhere will be fine. I've always heard people talk about the ratio but I honestly never believed it. I'm going to be touring early December I think to see it all for myself, so there's that.\nThanks for the nice response. It really helps in figuring out everything.",

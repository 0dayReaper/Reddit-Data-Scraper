    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm currently interested in transferring from ETSU to C of C for the fall semester (I'm a sophomore right now) and I want to know what student life is like there. I love the ocean and the outdoors in general, and I enjoy going to the movies, bowling, and just talking and hanging out, etc. I'm also straightedge (for those of you who don't know what that means, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs) and it's pretty hard for me to find people my age who don't drink (or at least know their limits and stick to them). So, another, more specific question I have is, are there many people there who aren't in the party scene and actually spend time outdoors and just doing simple but fun things with friends? I'm not at all religious, by the way, I just chose to be \"clean\" from the start. Thanks in advance for any helpful comments! :)",

You'll find no problems getting access to all of your interests here (although you will have to make a drive out of town to go hiking in any kind of mountains). We actually have an outdoor club just for people like yourself. Already they've gone kayaking, camping, and other things like that. As far as I know they're still functioning. If not then you can always start one. You can definitely find the kind of people you're looking for, it's just not as apparent than the general student population is. \n\n",

I dont want to say anything to dissuade you from coming here as I love it and don't want you to get the wrong impression, but as an example: on my way to car after work last night: I was involved in a drunken group hug and someone was peeing on the tree next to my car when I walked up and I thought he was trying to jump me and hilarious hijinks ensued. Ill be honest, lots of drinking going on down here",

I should be able to make a trip sometime in May, so I'm looking forward to that. I have another question. How close is the nearest shopping center? I realize there are a lot of touristy shops in town but I want to know how close the nearest Target and places like that are. Again, thanks for your comments! :)",

The only bad thing about living on the peninsula is that we don't have a Target/Wal-Mart within walking distance. You can take a 15 minute drive or 40 minute bus ride to get to them though. It's not too bad. We do have a CVS and soon a Walgreens within a 5 minute walk. ",

Most people shop, take walks, relax in their enos, fish, go to the beach, etc on weekends when it's nice out. \n\nAlmost everyone here drinks though. Not necessarily in a trashy way, people usually keep it together, but it's a fact of going to CofC. My friends and I aren't into the party scene, but we do enjoy drinking on the weekends in our apartment and watching movies, playing games, talking, etc. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them.

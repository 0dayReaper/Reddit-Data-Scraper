    "postText": "This school has been my top choice ever since I visited Charleston about a year ago. My overall GPA is about a 3.1. And I had to take numerous breaks through out my first years of community college due to finances. I explained all this in my essay and made sure to mention my lofty academic goals and my intention to major in international business. I have sent in the application without a letter a recommendation seeing how it is not required and I kind of wish I did in retrospect. Anybody else transfer to CofC with an A.A. with a 3.1 gpa and get in? Thanks guys hopefully I'll be a cougar soon enough.",

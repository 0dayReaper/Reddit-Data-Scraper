I just visited my other choice and attended the acceptance day for students and learned a lot about it. I love the atmosphere at cofc! I wanna know how's student life, what teachers helping out students, what people do for fun, studying abroad, do they have cultural events, how's the food and just things that I should know to help me make my decision. Thanks!",

But let\u2019s do a brief run down. \n\nStudent life is cool. Diversity isn\u2019t the best. But there are all types of students here. You wanna party? There\u2019s a crowd. Study till 4a? There\u2019s a crowd. Love to be involved with events? There\u2019s tons. \n\nEvery school has a shit teacher or two and cofc isn\u2019t an exception but overall I\u2019ve loved most of my teachers. Very helpful with office hours and research ops. Even the ones that have shit ratmyprofs have been decent with me. I am vocal In class tho. \n\nWhat students do for fun. Beach is close. Greek life is cool if you\u2019re into it. Lots of clubs to be involved in. Lots of night \u201cclubs\u201d bars to be involved with. \n\nStudying broad is huge here for how small the school is. Almost every program participates. Global opportunities. \n\nFood is great (southern focus). Not as diverse as I\u2019d like but I\u2019m used to a much bigger city. \n\nThere\u2019s cultural events here but it\u2019s not like a big city. Diversity is getting better slowly tho.",

If anything if you want a taste of the school and mainly the city (which is what most students end up coming here for), maybe defer from the other school and attend here for a semester for fun, then go to the other school later. This environment isn't sustainable for a productive undergraduate experience, if that's what you're looking for.",

I was going to use the aquarium garage but now its $300, and I heard a rumor that on-campus garages were going to start doing hourly rates. Either way, I can't afford it. Do you guys know where to find cheap parking not too far from campus?",

            "comment": "There are some residential areas near campus where you can park for free for a short while.  Most are only one-hour districts, but there are some streets that allow you to park for two hours for free.  If your classes are short or if you are able to move your car to a different street every once in a while, you can park for free.  \n\nAlso, the metered spots are free after 6pm if you take classes at night.  \n\nIt doesn't hurt to look for other deals too.  For example, I am a graduate student with a graduate assistantship, so as long as I use my student ID to pay, there are several parking garages on campus that I only have to pay $5 to park in all day.  If you have a job downtown or on campus, parking is something you could ask them about.\n\nWhat I do most often is ride my bike, though, because I live close enough to.",

    "postText": "Hey Reddit!\n\nI\u2019m a Dutch American Studies student at the University of Groningen. As part of the program, my faculty gives us the opportunity to go on an exchange with American students from certain partner-universities, and you\u2019ve guessed it: Charleston is one of those!\n\nThe thing is, for every American Studies student from Groningen an American has to go to the Netherlands. And as Groningen is not the most well-known city in Europe, I can only assume that many of you haven\u2019t heard of it which could lead to you not considering it as a viable option. \n\nAnd that, my friends, is a damn shame, because it truly is an amazing city. It has everything you expect from a Dutch city and the connection to the major cities in the Netherlands and Germany is good, which makes traveling very convenient. It is a major university city with nearly one-fourth of its population being a student. That, of course, means that the nightlife is diverse and fun. \n\nFurthermore, the university itself is great and always scores high on the worldwide rankings. \n\nIf some of you are considering going here after reading this post, do it. If the possibility is there I will get you a beer in one of our many pubs. \n\nObviously I have a double agenda here, but not only does you going to Groningen raise my chances to go to the United States for a semester, you will have an amazing time here.\n\nSome pictures:\n\n[Central Station](http://www.groningenwoont.nl/wp-content/gallery/groningen/netherlandsgroningen01.jpg)\n\n[One of the canals](http://toerisme.groningen.nl.4.cdn.iwink.nl/uploads/excotickaartbackground/21c48b51-e682-40aa-956c-e3cabb5e18af/2742169796)\n\n[The University building](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/090529_Academiegebouw_Groningen_NL.jpg)\n\nFor more information, you can e-mail me at thomofgroningen@gmail.com\n",

    "postText": "  \n\nThese uncertain times are the ones that challenge us. Just before this pandemic, I established my business. And then, this pandemic. My company at first, was completely stifled, but I am developing a model to evolve through these times. My company is seeking two individuals to become part of it\u2019s team. And my most sought-after value? Ambition and Heart. My companies mission? To redistribute the wealth directly to the community it serves.\n\nI acknowledge the post here might be a long shot. I am hoping to stay local. I want to reach out to people who \\*love\\* Charleston. More importantly, those who have a good heart and want to help with current global problems on a local level. \n\nPersonality is going to go a long way for me on this one. We are living in a changing world, and I need someone who has the ability to adapt. My company has a strong focus on environmentally friendly services and uniting local businesses together. I hope to find someone who can keep up with my company\u2019s tenacity and think differently. We need to get along, as we will work closely together. Of course, during these immediate days, we will practice social distancing, but we need to get along. All tasks needed can be done remotely. \n\nThe two roles I need filled are Social Media Management and Website Development. As Social Media Manager, you\u2019ll be response for taking care of social media platforms, helping grow the social media following, and, well, hopefully having a little bit of fun. The Website Developer, at this time, will be responsible with crafting a dynamic website in these uncertain times. \n\nThis is a small startup company that was just formed. COVID-19 has changed the original plan of the company, but it has not changed its direction. My long-term goal, is to obtain nonprofit status. I hope to establish a lot of chartable causes with this. And I want some people on the ground floor. As such, I am looking for someone with a heart. My company has had to make a pivot within this pandemic, and the focus is on helping Charleston\u2019s economy stay afloat. If you\u2019re thinking this might be you, send me a message on here. The person who will fill most at home here is a person who, right now, wants to do what they can to help Charleston as much as we can during this global pandemic.\n\n\u201cThink globally, act locally.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Matt (Founder)",

    "postText": "How hard is it really to get into cofc, I lived in Charleston (Daniel island) for all of my life leading up to 9th grade when I moved to Erie Pennsylvania. I love CHS and wanna come back so bad. Unfortunately when I moved I became depressed and had no motivation which cause me to blow off school work. Unfortunately I have a 2.9 but managed to get an 1150 on my SAT as well as being a varsity athlete. What do y\u2019all think my chances are looking like for acceptance, and what can I do to help me?",

I think you'll be good if you write good essays, and show what else you have to offer the school, besides just academic.",

    "postText": "I went to community college out of state and have worked the past three years, as well as did a stint in the military. I'll be attending in the fall, and worried about making friends. I assume I'll be a sophomore and probably living on campus - best way to get to know people? Also, anyone have any idea about playing club lacrosse and how to go about it, and also anyone have any opinions on rushing? I'll be 21 turning 22 again as probably a sophomore.",

There are a lot of people who transfer from community college, and there are a lot of veterans who are using their GI bill.\n\nThe best way to meet new people is to get involved in extra curricular activities. Club Lacrosse is a great idea. To sign up for club or intramural, you go down to the Physical Education center on George Street. It's right outside of the TD Arena. \n\nThere are a ton of different organizations on campus to get involved in. During the first month, the college will put on a street festival called \"Georgestock\". You should definitely go to this, because all the clubs and organizations will be out there looking to connect with new students. \n\nIf you're living on campus, you will also meet people in your dorm.\n\nYou will get a ton of email messages about activities on campus, so just keep an eye out for them and you will be fine. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

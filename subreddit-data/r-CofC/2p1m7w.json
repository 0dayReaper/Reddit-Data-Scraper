    "postText": "I just my acceptance letter, but my senior year grades are not looking too hot. I am usually an A/B student but right now I have 4 C's; partly due to senioritis, but mostly due to me picking up a new job working 6 days a week after school and on weekends to pay off some insurance bills (car accident). Am I in danger of getting my acceptance rescinded/revoked? Will admissions understand my situation and be forgiving? Am I worried over nothing? Please Help!!\n\nEDIT: This is my number one school and I intend on attending!",

You won't be rejected unless you outright fail required classes for (high school) graduation. If by some rare chance they do retract their offer, I'd contest it with an explanation of the situation.

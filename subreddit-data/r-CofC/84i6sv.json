DNR, SC Aquarium, Port Authority, and a few others will be speaking and answering questions. It's important to be informed of what exactly is happening offshore at Charleston. Please come out and support the ocean. (https://www.facebook.com/events/2149846041700174/?notif_t=plan_user_joined&amp;notif_id=1521070570182193)",

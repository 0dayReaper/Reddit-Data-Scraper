However, I cannot seem to find any online. Does anyone know where I might be able to find one? Preferably online since I live in Boston..... Thank you!",

You may be able to call them and see if they can ship it to you. \n\nEDIT: Sorry, didn't see anything in the store. Try calling the bookstore still though, they may be able to point you in the right direction. Good luck!",

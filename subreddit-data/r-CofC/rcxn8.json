    "postText": "Does anyone know the details of the Spring Bike Auction? It was briefly mentioned in a recent e-mail about a new bike policy (sent out March 23). The e-mail says it will take place on April 3rd, but I can't seem to find any details. Since that's only 2 weeks away, they have to have a time and location by now, right? If anyone could point me to a link or event page, I would be really grateful!\n\nEdit: Left out a word. Whoops.",

            "comment": "F\n\nHere's a couple of mine:\n\nI didn't drink. I had a buddy gave me his ID (wasn't even his originally) so I could get into clubs. But I was walking around King Street and ran into one of my friends and his ex girlfriend (ex at the time, even) who were on their way to the Upper Deck. Dude's ex was hot, so I figured what the heck, but I let them know that I'd never really drank before. I found out later, that's basically code for \"Get me fucked up because it'll be funny,\" because that's exactly what happened. I thought was doing pretty well holding my alcohol, until I got up for the bathroom the first time. I had no idea what was going on. So, yeah, my first drunk experience was at the Upper Deck.\n\nA few years later, I had gotten buzzed at Mellow Mushroom (100 beer club member, thankfully) and realized I needed to pee just a little bit into my walk home. I hit up the Upper Deck, but felt weird just using their bathroom, so I grabbed a pint of PBR (I remember I asked the bartender for \"A glass of yonder peeburr,\" pronounced as such and he was understandably confused). Pretty much my only other memory of that night is being in some stranger's apartment (still have no idea who it was). I'm pretty sure it was a weekday, too.",

    "postText": "Hey. I'm assuming that some of you like music. So do we. Cofc has a record label. We're called 1770 records. At the end of the semester we'll be putting on a show. So if you like jazz or bands like Long Miles, Wadata, HeyRocco, South Street, and Stoplight Observations, you'll love our show. Details aren't exact right now, so I'll keep you updated. I'd love to hear any ideas to make the show a great success. Check us out on facebook!",

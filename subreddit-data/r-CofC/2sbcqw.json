Charleston is making parking more and more expensive and they've eliminated a lot of the free parking areas. \n\nThese tips are only really helpful if you're coming from outside of the peninsula, but.. If you go northward on the peninsula and are willing to walk a mile, I know Columbus Street is free (at least it was seven months ago). There are some areas around Colonial Lake as well (or there used to be), but you'll need to get there early. ",

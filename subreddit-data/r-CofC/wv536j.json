With that being said, I did take a geology class here and learned a lot. There\u2019s some fools rocks you can check out from the library but this isn\u2019t called the low country for nothing.",

You also take field trips for shark tooth hunting and seeing the earthquake prevention systems downtown.\n\nYou can check out one of the professors Robert Boessenecker on an episode of shark week about the megalodon.",

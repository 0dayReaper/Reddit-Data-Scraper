Also I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s an option in dorm selection to be placed with other members. \n\nCofC is a really progressive school despite being very very Southern and rooted in tradition and I\u2019m sure you would have a good time there l",

They weren't my scene so I left the board, but if you just wanna hang out with other queer people and have game nights and stuff then they're your group.\n\nThere's plenty of queer people who don't interact with PRISM tho. I've met so many people who just do a little bit of everything or nothing on campus. It's varied but pretty open all things considered.\n\nIf you want a better idea, I could send you the PRISM email address and they could explain things better, and perhaps give you the discord link- there's about 100 of us chilling on there most of the time!",

I started going by a different name and pronouns and everyone was pretty chill about it. I was able to get an ID without my deadname within 24 hours of requesting a preferred name change even though I hadn't legally changed it yet. \n\nThere were sometimes students would would say something shitty, but they were shut down *fast* by professors.",

The teacher was also super sweet as well and is openly queer if I remember correctly. I don't live on campus and don't interact with other students too much but I think most of them are accepting of LGBT students.",

Extracurriculares are big. \n\nIm minoring in comp sci but I\u2019m probably switching that to my major. Why not do the comp sci? I think it\u2019s a more secure degree when job hunting.  All dependent on what you\u2019re looking for tho.",

I know this school has connections with google and some other companies so i was wondering if that would also be helpful for cis majors as well",

Love the emails but curious about goog as well. \n\nCIS you need to take accounting! Ew. But the math isn\u2019t that bad for CS. Discrete Structures I sucks but the others aren\u2019t bad at all.",

I do suggest getting hands on experience and projects and certs to set yourself different from other fresh candidates.\n\nI am not good with Java coding nor math as well, but I did fine afterwards \ud83d\ude0c\n\nI graduated in 2017.",

            "comment": "When I attended CofC, which was some time ago, [**Marcia Snyder**](http://spinner.cofc.edu/~facfocus/Faculty_Articles/SnyderArticle.htm) was one of my favorite professors. I took her micro and macro economics courses. She not only would teach the material, but she would discuss (often at the beginning of class) current events that directly related to what we were learning at the moment. For me that type of real world examples really helped me get a handle on the subject matter. Plus she was fun, easy going, very nice, and would go out of her way to help you with the subject matter even so much as attending after class study groups. \n\n**Guoli Liu** was another favorite professor of mine. I took three different political science courses with him and enjoyed every one. He was born in China, so his English reflects that a bit, but that's not to say he's hard to understand. He just has a certain way of speaking, which at times was funny but not in a mocking sort of way. Like I said, I enjoyed his classes, he was very patient with explaining new concepts or ideas, he would go out of his way to help you after class, and he is a genuinely nice person. And his grading style was fair. There was always a lot to learn for the exams, but he would give you a topic study sheet that would tell you exactly what would be covered and how. Meaning what's multiple choice, what would be short answer, and what would be the essay questions. Anyway I definitely recommend him for anyone that is majoring/minoring in Political Science.",

I also took Calvin Blackwell for micro for summer I, and I really liked his teaching style, though he definitely liked to lean more on the mathy side of things (which is partially why I liked his class). \n\nIf any of you guys take Guoli Liu, ask him to sing his Chinese opera. I sorta doubt he'd do it, but you may as well try. I got to enjoy it during a China study abroad trip during the summer of '08. ",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am interning in Charleston this summer and was looking to sublease for the summer starting May 10 and ending sometime in August (yet to be determined but my guess is the 9th or 16th).\n\nI am currently a Junior at Iowa State University and was looking to live preferably with roommates so that they could show me around and like to have a good time.\n\n\nA little about me:\n\nMy name is Steve, I'm originally from Ohio and as I said before , currently go to Iowa State. I am studying Management Information Systems and will be interning at Boeing. I like the outdoors, sports, and pretty excited to be in Charleston for the summer. I get along with most people and have a pretty outgoing personality. \n\nIf anyone is looking for a subletter please let me know! \n\nThanks,\nSteve ",

My husband works at Boeing and there are plenty of people you will meet there to hang out with.  You could also find out if Boeing has any other interns coming to the area that you could possibly room with!  Good luck! Airbnb is a great website where you can find a ton vacation rentals (some whole house, some room only) maybe you could find a rental that way!\n",

    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking about transferring in the fall and had overall questions about the school.\n\n1. What are the academics like? Is there good networking, class size, easy/hard? (I plan on majoring in marketing.)\n2. What is Greek life like, is it big, cliquish, do you need to be in it to party/have friends?\n3. Is the school diverse, open minded, progressive?\n4. Is there a good amount of school spirit and community? Friendliness?\n5. Night life and day to day things to do?\n6. Is the city overall safe?\n7. Do you need to be well off financially to go to school here? \n8. Does going to school here feel more like a vacation than a school? \n9. Is the honors college worth it and is it harder? \n10. Upper classmen dorms? \n11. Do transfers seem to fit in? \n12. Is the gender ratio a big deal?",

Again, as big as you want to make it. Greek life has never been shoved down anyone\u2019s face. Ive been to a few Greek house parties back in the day. I\u2019m back at CofC after a long break and still Greek life just seems like iou wanna join cool, you don\u2019t cool. Deff don\u2019t need to be in a frat/soro to fit in. \n3. Diversity has always been a struggle here but over the years it\u2019s gotten much better. Kids seem very very open minded about the current issues that are all over the media today. I\u2019ve never encountered any hate towards anyone because of race or sexuality. It obv happens somewhere but i haven\u2019t seen it. \n4. The basketball team is very good this year and games are usually packed. Baseball is also division 1 and fun to go see a game. No football so there\u2019s not any huge tailgates per se but there\u2019s been really school spirity stuff going on for March madness that has had good turnout. \n5. Night life is s tier in my opinion. King street is legit behind the school and there are 50 bars to choose from. Back in the day when I was a little younger I\u2019d walk down st Phillip and pretty much walk into any house party and have a good time. \n6.  Stay with a group and don\u2019t walk by yourself after the bars close and you\u2019ll be okay. \n7. Deff some freshman riding around in 2020 range rovers but no one cares at all if all you got is a bike. \n8. Spring semester yea. It\u2019s so hard to focus when the weather starts getting nice and the beach is so close. \n9. I know a few honors students and it\u2019s all what you make it. Some are super involved and others are just doing it cause there parents made them. \n10. Yes. \n11. Tons of people transfer to cofc and get along just fine. No one cares. There\u2019s a large community college here where a lot of students start. \n12. People will say sO MaNY GuRlS and yea there are more girls but if you\u2019re concerned about the party aspect of it. I\u2019d say it\u2019s either 50/50 that party or a little more dudes. Doesn\u2019t affect classes at all.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm about to graduate high school here in city, and I've decided to go to CofC since it's both cheaper than I could get outta state and fairly liberal compared with the rest of Charleston from what I hear. I reckon I'm just a bit nervous of what to expect at CofC, y'know? Freshman jitters.\n\nGraduating Porter Gaud, and while it can be liberal at times, more often than not it's got a lot of.. er. Smart idiots, I guess. It's hard to know what to call a guy who in general's pretty intelligent but then goes off and says \"the poor should die off cause it's 'their fault' for their issues\". \n\nI'm gonna assume there's nothing like that in CofC, but also--is the school welcoming to new students? I had a lot of issues trying to make friends here with well solidified cliques and the like. And are people more open minded to things like atheism and LGBT, all that sort of stuff? Never really been able to be wholly myself in PG just because I don't want to be ostracized for my views and nature, and I really want CofC to be a fresh start in that regard.\n\nAh sorry, this has gone on way too long. Just any tips and advice would be appreciated really. Thank you!",

Most people here are open-minded to different views, beliefs, LGBT, but there is always that one kid in bio class that points out how dinosaur fossils were fabricated by the devil. \n\nYou definitely will not be ostracized unless you isolate yourself. There are groups and clubs etc. for everything and they will welcome you with open arms! ",

As a member of both the AHA (Atheist Humanist Alliance) and the GSA, I think you'll do just fine. It's not about looking at those that don't share your ideals as much as focusing on those that do. ",

That's the freshman dorm and its the most expensive one that allows them. It would make sense for the richer ones to be there as they are new and haven't been exposed to the world and all of the shittyness. Do NOT take 8am classes if you can help it... Best places to live if you're weird, Lodge. If you're a guy and not weird, Craig. Stay away from Room 224 unless you're also autistic. (Not really...) If you're a female....just stay away from Berry (unless you like and/or get along VERY well with females... Still wouldn't advise it though.) Don't partake in Thirsty Thursdays every Thursday. There's no such thing as a Walk of Shame. Of you ever meet Kon, Landon, or Exavia...or even Dotson (you'd have to stand directly in front of him) say hello and reference this. MSPS (Multicultural Center....yellow house on Pitt and Calhoun) is your friend.\nIF YOU CAN, DO SPECTRA!!!\nSend me a private message and we'll get you started with networking and stuff....",

Don't know anything about the people except for your description, but that'd make sense. Tour guide I had mentioned off hand that he'd been at Liberty a good year or so and only truly met like three people. Think I'll avoid that, aye. Actually applied for Lodge too--seems like it's the only colorful dorm on campus. Maybe overly colorful, but way more appealing than just lots of grays. \n\nYeaaah, Berry didn't seem that interesting to me. Not to mention it felt like someone tied a mini sun to the ceiling with how bloody hot and stuffy it felt in there. Maybe the other girls in there are just that suffocating, I dunno lol. And aight, got'cha! Thanks so much for all this stuff--lots of good things here!",

Some of the other floors were pretty .. douchey. \n\nI don't think anyone likes living in Berry. \n\nLodge is a haven for drug users. Mostly Pot, but there are people there who are on some harder stuff. They have a pretty laid back culture, and a lot of people really enjoy staying there. It is certainly more of a community than the other dorms. \n\nMcCalister in my experience was pretty douchey. A lot of entitled people with more money than sense. \n\nI don't know enough about McConnell to comment. Other than the fact that is one of the older dorms. I only knew a few people who lived there and didn't visit very often.",

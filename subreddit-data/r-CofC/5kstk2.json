I applied to the honors program as well and I was wondering if the acceptance or denial came separately for the honors program or what. Also what is your favorite part about the school. Thanks :)",

Most honors students will tell you it's not super worth it, but it still looks good on grad school applications. My favorite part was the class sizes. I don't think I ever had a class with more than 40 people and most were about 20. I guess that is one advantage to honors classes. lol",

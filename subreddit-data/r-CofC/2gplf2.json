    "postText": "Im trying to find a cost effective way to make a website for my mobile car detailing business but certain features are beyond my grasp such as adding features to pay through the site and set appointments. In addition, I just need something clean which I am not capable of. Can anyone suggest the best route for me to take? do people ever design templates for projects they could repurpose and sell? Thanks!",

Basically, it is a platform that allows you to customize web site templates. \n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you could try to create your own website using Wordpress, Joomla or whichever CMS (content management system) you prefer. I've created websites before, and this is the method I used. \n\nBasically this method includes --\n\n1. Registering your domain\n2. Finding a hosting company to host your domain\n3. Installing a content management system via your cPanel\n4. Buying, downloading and installing a website theme. I use Themeforest for website templates.\n5. Add content, tweak your theme, etc. \n\nTo receive payment and to schedule an appointment through the site, you will need a specialized template. So you need to make sure those features are included. \n\nThe third option is to hire someone to do it. But chances are this option will be cost prohibitive. ",

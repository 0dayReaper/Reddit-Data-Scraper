I'm not big on parties myself, I went to maybe six my freshman year and then got sick of them and started chilling with friends in our rooms and smoking copious amounts of weed. If you're not the partying type, all you have to do is not go party. \n\nAll in all, I think CofC is a great school and I love it here, wouldn't trade it for the world. ",

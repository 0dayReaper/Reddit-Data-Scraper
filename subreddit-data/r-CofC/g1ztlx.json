I was hoping some of you could give me insight into how big my classes would be and if the level of difficulty permits you from having any sort of social life. Thanks!",

I\u2019ve taken intro level history and economics classes that had 90-130 people and then I\u2019ve taken \u201csports in Irish culture\u201d with 12 people and upper level French classes with like 8 people. Classes that are required for a lot of different majors or requirements tend to be much larger. On average you\u2019ll get between 20-30 people in classes.",

            "comment": "Hello! I'm a c/o 2019 grad and I double majored in Political Science and International Studies plus I was in the Honors College. \n\nInternational studies class sizes vary but are typically on the smaller side. You might be looking at 30ish people in an introductory level course and this will decrease as you progress. My senior year capstone course was around 15 people, for example. International Studies professors are quite good at making sure the classes are discussion-based so when those class sizes start decreasing you are expected to contribute substantially to the discussions/debates.\n\nThe major's difficulty is not a straightforward thing because everyone has different experiences. The first reason for this is because you must choose a regional focus (Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, or Asia (includes the Middle East)). Your experience in the major will largely be characterized by this focus area because the lion's share of courses you take pertain to this area--including a requirement to take more language courses pertaining to your region than you would otherwise be responsible for under general education language requirements. Furthermore, there is a study abroad requirement that must be fulfilled in your selected region so that will be a unique experience for each student.\n\nI took the Asia concentration and studied Mandarin for three years which got me up to 400-level coursework in the language because I followed an accelerated track abroad in China (Chengdu). I was also able to take Political Science courses on Chinese politics and count them for both PoliSci and International Studies; you can double-dip like this for three courses during your four years. Indeed, double-dipping is common for this major in part because most professors are actually employed in various departments (economics, political science, religious studies, languages, etc.) and will teach courses that fulfill International Studies requirements. The actual International Studies department only has a handful of faculty members itself.\n\nRegarding workload, it's not bad at all. I fully recommend doing two majors if one of them will be international studies. For me, I chose political science as my second major because its global politics courses are much more international relations-focused than most international studies courses. Think of the IS major as language/culture and PoliSci as politics (duh) and the ways global powers interact with each other. It's also common for IS majors to double with History, Economics, International Business, English, and even STEM fields. Also, if you're in the honors college then you'll be able to take honors courses that satisfy your major requirements!\n\nI've never seen people double-majoring and in the honors college having serious issues with workloads. Most students fitting this profile still have time to get involved in the community or get jobs during the school year much less to develop a healthy social life. I would not worry about not having time to have fun; as you get adjusted anywhere for undergrad you'll work out a system of getting sh!t done so that school doesn't totally consume you. If you do run into problems with this, CofC and the honors college in particular have great advising mechanisms in place to support students.\n\nI hope this helps!",

Like the other guy said you'll need a language to hunker down in. \n\nBeing at CofC means you'll have a social life no matter what. The city is awesome and once we get out of this pandemic state we'll be able to return to the norm.\n\nSocializing, I will say, will be what you make it. Don't keep yourself secluded and go ahead and put yourself into new situations.\n\nWhat other schools are you considering?\n\nEdit: Practically every class over 300 level is going to be 15 or less students with a few exceptions.",

I don\u2019t believe you have to pay once you have that pass, so I would look for the maroon and white parking spot signs because that\u2019s where the pass applies. Hope this was helpful :)",

You could be parking in the lot all the way down by the joe or you could be parked a block away from main campus or even at the aquarium garage. Just make sure to do your research. The good lots always get taken way ahead of time and can cost close to a thousand bucks a semester. The other ones leave you a shuttle ride away from campus. Consider taking a park and ride with CARTA if there\u2019s one near you. I parked at the aquarium as a commuter for 4 years and it was only a quick 10 minute walk to campus but cost 4-500 bucks a semester.",

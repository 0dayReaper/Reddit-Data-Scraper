    "postText": "hi yall! i had a question and wanted to see if anyone had any input. I am coming in the fall and have warren as my top choice for dorms, specifically the four bedroom private suite. I have three other girls who are also interested and would love to all live together. However, i was looking through the housing part of the website and it basically says, if you choose a private room, you cannot pick your own roommates? has anyone gone through this/know anyone that has or have any advice as to what to do? being in warren is definitely something I want however, i do not like the idea of random roommates. thank you!",

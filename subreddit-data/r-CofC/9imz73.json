    "postText": "Hi all, I'm looking for a roommate downtown.  I'm moving soon to a building called The Guild, and need someone to fill the other bedroom.  2BR/2BA. Rent and utilities would run you about $1,500, give or take. Parking might be more. I will furnish the entire apartment except for your bedroom/bathroom, so I would prefer someone neat who won\u2019t destroy my stuff. I\u2019m a C of C student, a veteran using the GI Bill, so I\u2019m a little older than your traditional college student. If you're at all interested, shoot me a message. ",

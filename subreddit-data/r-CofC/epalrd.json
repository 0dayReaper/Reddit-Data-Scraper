To get financial aid you must visit the website and fill out some stuff. \n\nIf the school has told you what scholarships they\u2019re awarding this is all you\u2019re getting unless you have ones from other organizations (you might get an \u201cinstitutional need based grant\u201d but considering you have a 15k scholarship it\u2019s highly unlikely) \n\nVisit your MyCharleston and look at the \u201cfinancial aid\u201d tab &amp; click \u201caward\u201dfor more information",

Basically what did your application look like? I\u2019m trying to gauge if I would be awarded a lot of merit money. Thanks !!!",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a 19 year old who has got into this school and has been considering it but have been losing interest based on things I\u2019ve heard, wondering if these are true from current or former students perspective \n1. For starters I\u2019ve heard no one comes here for education, they come here to party and hang out on the beach\n2. That if you are not a social butterfly or in Greek life you will have a crappy experience due to no spirit or opportunities to meet people.\n\n\nJust going off of people I\u2019ve met and what I\u2019ve heard but wondering if people have found good friends and a good education without these experiences.",

It was kind of awesome to hang out with people so into the thing that you're into which doesn't really happen as much after college (excepting grad school, which is the same but even more passion and even more specialized). The party and beach scene are always there but there are a lot of people who don't participate and even more people who don't participate all the time. There are places that focus more on academics than CofC, to be sure, but it's not just a daycare for young adults who only want to have fun.\n\nI will add that, if you're interested in something like STEM where it is common to do laboratory academic research in that field, I would say that CofC has some advantages by not doing that because the professors focus a lot more on education. I went to a world-renown university for grad school and the actual teaching was a notable step down from my undergraduate teaching despite the fact that some of the professors teaching the courses wrote the standard textbook for that subject.",

The student body has no idea what a party actually is, just want to seem like they do since they basically have nothing but academics and beaches to attract students",

I was in a top sorority at one point and went out all the time but I was miserable. I now have a few close friends and spend most of my time alone. Join clubs and get out as much as u can to meet people. But its much harder due to the fact most people do party alot",

US news world report is a great source but if you want personal experiences then here it is:\n\n- Everyone just goes to grad school afterwards\n\n- The beach was fun but not a daily activity \n\n- you can learn to sail for free\n\n- king street has incredible happy hours so you can get James Beard award winning restaurants for under $20\n\n- you mostly get to know people in your major\n\n- a lot of people married their college sweethearts. \n\nGraduated 2011",

    "postText": "**I am a transfer student and my first semester will be this fall 2022. I am a biology major. I keep going in between a B.A and a B.S. I wanted to talk with other biology students about the classes. I am not the best with math so even though I transferred in 66 credits and I am technically a junior- I still have to take pre calc (MAT 111) and the statistical methods. I have never taken chemistry or physics before in high school or college. I did very well in A&amp;P 1&amp;2, Bio 111/112, and Microbiology. I suck at college algebra but I did very well in college prob &amp; stat.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you happen to run across this please tell me what you wished someone would have said to you when you started this major.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is-- do you think it would be too much in a semester to take:\n\n1.)Chem 111 &amp; the lab  ***OR***  PHYS 101    (Which one should I take first which is harder in your opinion)\n\n2.) Statistical methods **(HOW HARD IS THIS CLASS?)** \n\n3.)Biology class level 300+ (Either genetics or  Bio 320 Histology or Bio 336 Parasitology) \n\n4.) Random class like maybe a psychology (for my minor in psych)  or a pre-modern history. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(For background I also work 25 hours a week as a lab assistant and it is super flexible as long as I get my hours in) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you :)",

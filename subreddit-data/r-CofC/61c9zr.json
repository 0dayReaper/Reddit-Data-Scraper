    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm a veteran going to school on the Voc Rehab program (like the GI Bill, but actually better) in the DC area. I'm looking to transfer to the College of Charleston for Fall 2018 and have some questions about the degree requirements for the Historic Preservation and Community Planning program. \n\nI can't find a full breakdown of what is required for the HPCP degree. So far, between the liberal arts/general education requirements and the HPCP requirements, I can only account for 83 hours out of the 122 required for graduation. Are the remaining 39 credits just electives? Any guidance on this would be awesome.\n\nAlso, anyone in the HPCP program, please feel free to tell me what you think of the program! Thanks everyone. ",

I've taken a couple classes just for fun outside of my major and minor like sociology and an education class. ",

You need a certain number of credits overall, and a number of those courses are pre-defined by being required for general education or your degree. If you're quick on the registration, you could take sailing for some of those credits (when I went, that course filled up quickly). Unfortunately, I graduated nearly ten years ago, and I double majored in two completely unrelated fields, so I can't offer any suggestions for fun classes that would enrich your life. All of my classes were planned out before I ever started.\n\nOn another note, I am also from DC and living there now.",

It's changed a lot in ten years, though, so maybe that's not the case. It was also hot, humid, and quite rainy. Buy an umbrella, especially one that will do okay with wind.",

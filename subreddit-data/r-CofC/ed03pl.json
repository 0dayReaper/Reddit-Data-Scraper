Some who find java easy find python hard, and vice versa.\n\nThird/4th year is PHP, Docker probably, using frameworks like Flask, Laravel. This is as far in development as a CIS major will take you. I think CS majors end up taking C++ as well  \n\n\nSource: Just graduated with a CIS degree  \n\n\nMANY of my friends dropped out of the program after python. Even more after Java. If you can make it past Java, you'll probably make it the whole way through.  \n\n\nIf you wanna get ahead, study Java, practice Python and Java ON PAPER (as dumb as it sounds, tests / quizzes are on paper), so get your syntax right. Also study Discrete Structures - like algorithms, set and logic theory, and using proofs like induction (strong and weak). I passed Discrete with a D, now they require a C+. Avoid professor Andrew Prowezki (can't remember his last name, it looks russian)  \n\n\nIf you wanna get ahead on Database class stuff, practice SQL Queries with subselects and joins.",

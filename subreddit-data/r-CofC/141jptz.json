    "postText": "Hey, everyone! I'm an incoming junior, international transfer student joining the CompSci and Computation in the Arts majors, and I'm going to be living out in Hanahan, which means I definitely need to drive to classes. I'll be travelling between main campus and the harbour walk campus a lot, but I've been reading a lot of posts about parking nightmares; so, here is the question: **What are my options** (some combination of cost and time) **for getting between the two campuses?** I'm open to hearing anything between the range of expensive, but convenient vs. more affordable, but inconvenient.  \n\n\nI'm seeing posts in here saying there upwards of $200 parking with a substantial walk to get to the main campus plus (according to Google Maps) a 17 minute walk between main campus and the harbour walk campus. While that's something I *can* do, there are certain health complications which make long walks taxing for me. I'll do it if I need, but I would love to hear what other options I have. I'm seeing information about CARTA and DASH downtown, but because I'm not familiar with the area, I'm not sure if they are of any use for these purposes. So, I'd love to hear your input!   \n\n\nWhat methods do you use to get between the campuses? Is there parking near the harbour walk campus instead of aiming for the main campus? Anyone with disabilities that have any tips or tricks? Anyone in my majors with some insight? Any information would be wildly helpful.  \n\n\n*Tl;dr: I'm disabled and have to drive to campus from Hanahan. The combination of finding parking, paying, walking from parking to main campus and from main campus to the harbour walk campus sounds daunting. Any tips?*",

I know you mentioned walking would be difficult, but if riding doesn\u2019t pose that same difficulty, the ride isn\u2019t bad. I don\u2019t know what your plan is for parking your car downtown, but moving it between the campus\u2019s all day would be very annoying, it will be much less annoying to park once and then ride a bike from campus to campus. As long as you have a U lock and lock your bike up properly, you could leave it locked on campus over night.",

The passes are limited and it\u2019s not guaranteed you\u2019ll get one. \n\n2.  Park in a meter spot if you can find one. It comes out to like $2 per hour or something like that. \n\n3. Park in the garage and pay the $2 per hour or whatever it is. The garage is never full and like I said earlier it\u2019s across the street from HW. \n\n4. Park at the battery or other free street parking areas downtown that are roughly a mile or 2 away. Buy a bike/scooter to get from where you park to HW. Sucks if it\u2019s raining and popular spots fill up quick.  There are unknown spots that are always open but I\u2019m not gonna blow them up here. You\u2019ll deff get to know them by word or mouth. \n\n5. There are unicorn free spots VERY close to HW but they fill up quick and not all cars are built for those spots. Talk to people and walk around the area to figure it out. \n\nLet me know if you have other questions.",

They are separated by less than a mile. \n\nParking at main campus is much harder. So aim for parking around HW and use the shuttle. There are several garages on main campus but they fill up with daily customers fast so you can\u2019t really count on them.",

Also as mentioned are the CARTA shuttles which are just free anyway that go between places on the peninsula and the stop is right on the corner of the main campus.",

The walk to main campus isn't that bad, like 15-20 minutes depending on where you are. There's also a CARTA shuttle that comes by every 15 mins or so that takes you from the aquarium to main campus. There might be a couple other small lots downtown that are left over, but they'll be more pricey, same with non-cofc lots.\n\nYou def don't need a car downtown, but as /u/Arcanine26 said,  there are lots of fun surrounding areas that you'd need a car to get to.",

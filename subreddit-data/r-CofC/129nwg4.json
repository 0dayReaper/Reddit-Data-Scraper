    "postText": "Hello! Is there anyone in here that's in the environmental geosciences degree program or knows anyone in that program? Im researching environmental programs for various schools and trying to figure out where I want to focus. \n\nBasic questions, what's the curriculum like, what does it cover, what are the kinds of jobs that are being suggested one could get after completing the course, are there any clubs on campus that would be relevant?\n\nAny and all info would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

It really feels like a family and almost everyone I graduated with got jobs right away, I landed an amazing position within 2 months of graduating and I can directly attribute that to my coursework and research in the geo program. Got accepted into one of the top schools in the country masters program as well. I would do it 1000 times over.",

Since we have a dorm thread, we should totally post our majors in this one so we can see who we might be having classes in.  Even if you're undecided you should post what extra classes you're in.  To start it off, I'm a Women's Issues/Gender Studies + Psychology double major right now, and I'm taking some music theory too so freshman year isn't terribly dull.  ",

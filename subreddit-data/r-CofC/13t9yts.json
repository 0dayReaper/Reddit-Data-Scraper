Your SAT or ACT scores will help offset a lower GPA of you score well on one.   \n\nDefinitely sign up to take both tests early so you can have time to take it twice!  And remember:  you need 3 years of a foreign language to qualify for admissions.",

Cofc doesn\u2019t require you to submit SAT or ACT scores, but if you get a high enough of score it can boost your chances. As it stands now, you should be totally fine to get in to Cofc it\u2019s not really competitive.",

Test scores are optional according to [this source](https://admissions.cofc.edu/applyingtothecollege/test-optional-faqs/index.php). Keep in mind that if these are averages, there is a sizeable acceptance below those scores. You aren't significantly below any of these metrics, so just go ahead and apply.   \n\n\nIf you want further clarity, the admissions office helped me out when gauging my application strength and even gave suggestions to bolster my chances should I need them. Best of luck!",

All spots are atleast $200+ a month which is not going to work with a college students budget\u2026. \nI\u2019m lost and i don\u2019t know what to do, any suggestions??",

            "comment": "Unfortunately that\u2019s probably the absolute cheapest you will find. I\u2019m actually surprised you even found somewhere offering $200. \n\nThere are free street spots but 99% of them have days where street sweeping happens. So if you are able to find an area that is 1) not residentially restricted and 2) not a meter; you\u2019ll have to make sure you find the sign that tells you what days Street sweeping happens and move it on those days. It doesn\u2019t take long. I\u2019ve lived in one of those districts before. \n\nThese spots aren\u2019t near campus. They are semi close but you\u2019ll need a bike or don\u2019t mind walking 10ish minutes from the dorms. Also some of these areas of free street parking are near areas where I wouldn\u2019t leave my car several days. People catch on to cars that sit for days and will be tempted. Especially if they are out of state plates. \n\nLastly, make friends and ask around. There are some unicorn spots close to campus. The ones I described above tho are somewhere north of campus. \n\nUse your brain and be careful.",

I think i\u2019m just gonna have to leave my car at home\u2026 Besides, everything in charleston is within walking distance. I just wanted my car for when i wanna go visit friends at other colleges, my family, etc\u2026",

Those fees have been going up lately and it doesn\u2019t make much sense if you use it beyond the cost of what you would pay monthly. \n\nProb the right call leaving it at home freshman year tho.",

You\u2019ll see other cars parked there and left overnight but it\u2019s slightly sketch. If you\u2019re just taking an Uber from campus to the stop you should be completely fine.",

            "comment": "Honestly I doubt you will be able to find a spot near campus. If you're willing to walk 10-15 minutes then there are some good lots but beyond that it would be street parking. I live off campus now but my apartment (I live above one of the shops on king) doesn't have parking so I pay to park in a lot. It's $175 a month, a paved lot (not gravel), semi-elevated so it won't flood if it rains, they are diligent about towing cars that don't have passes which I like because it means they monitor the lot and they don't oversell it so there are always spots to pick from. That being said, it is a tradeoff. While it's only 5 minutes from my apartment its 15 from campus. You could try to post on facebook and see if anyone will sell you a driveway spot but the only problem there is most driveways are a 'pull in and back out' situation multiple cars deep so if someone needs to move a car you might be fucked. I won't lie, having a car with you freshman year is honestly a blessing. You don't need one since you live downtown but it's nice to have the freedom to just get in your car and do what you want.",

One time in particular I think I went to 4-5 different garages and lots and they were all full. I actually missed a lab one day because there was no where I could park. It really sucks \ud83d\ude15",

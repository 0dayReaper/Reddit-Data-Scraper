    "postText": "Hey everyone! Myself and 2 others will be interning in Charleston for the summer, and we need somewhere to live. \nWe want to be downtown, and we'd really really really prefer the place to be furnished. We'll be there mid/late May to very early August. I have a cat, so it needs to be pet friendly (deposit okay).\n\nWe can easily find more interns to fill rooms, so if you know of anywhere with 3 or more rooms available, please let me know! I can't get in to any CofC Facebook groups cuz I don't have an official cofc email. I've been checking craigslist and the off campus housing page but haven't been having any luck so far. ",

            "comment": "**AC's Bar and Grill**, my second home once I was of age. Great food, laid back atmosphere, kind of a neighborhood everyone knows everyone else kind of place. At least it was when I was there in the early 2000's. A place like that doesn't really change much though.\n\n**The Griffin** was another. **Tasty Thai** is great. **Tsunami** was always a good time, provided you got there early enough to grab a table before it got super crowded. **Big John's**. **Meritage**, which was beside Big John's, was one of my other favorite haunts, but I think they have closed now. :( There are dozens of others I could list, some I'm sure have changed or moved since I was there. Really if you walk down King or Market, you can't go wrong. \n\nOh and **Charlie's Little Bar** above what was Saracen was a great hang out spot. One really cool thing it had/has going for it is that it's fairly well hidden. The fairly nondescript door to it was in a bank parking lot and you had to go up a flight of stairs to get to it. I always loved taking friends there who had lived in Charleston a number of years and never even knew it was there. It was small, dark, with large leather chairs and couches with a cool atmosphere. I'm guessing it's still around, but I don't know for sure. I'll have to put that on my list for the next time I head back to Charleston.",

I'm not sure if this is still going on, but they have trivia night on wednesday's that is a ton of fun. ",

It's kind of tucked away in this little nook, and my friend and I discovered it by accident. It's one of the most enjoyable places in Charleston to sit down and eat.\n\nAnd my absolute *favorite* place to go to is Mellow Mood. It's this little place off King and the guy who owns it is super nice and fun to talk to, and his other employee is the same way. The owner goes out of town pretty often to travel and he brings back some awesome stuff. \n",

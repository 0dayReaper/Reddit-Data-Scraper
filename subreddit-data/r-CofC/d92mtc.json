So it gives you essentially two majors in one, and given a lot of businesses are becoming tech-focused nowadays, having that hybrid education should prove very fruitful. IMO CIS is going to become the big CS degree to have, but it comes down to preferences.",

However, I don\u2019t know what MIS entails, and this is all personal opinion. I just find it hard to believe that Cyber Security ain\u2019t pan out as it\u2019s being predicted to. I\u2019ve talked to a couple of people who\u2019re higher up in the industry and they generally seem to agree.  \n\nBut it\u2019s up to what you want to do, jobs won\u2019t be hard to come by for any CS student if we\u2019re being honest. I think the ratio of open job opportunities to qualified individuals to fill them is like, 7:1 at least.",

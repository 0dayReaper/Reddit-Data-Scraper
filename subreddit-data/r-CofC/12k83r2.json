With that being said, and thru personal experience, you don\u2019t have to be in a frat/soro to have fun with the Greek scene here. \n\nAlso, the regular party scene is rather large. Walk down the major streets close to campus and you can hit up 10 house parties if your heart desires. \n\nKing Street is basically on campus and it\u2019s where all the bars you want to be at are. \n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of partying in Charleston at all.",

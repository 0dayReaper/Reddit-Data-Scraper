It's very hard to actually meet and get to know people and I never really talked to my neighbors much. However, Berry does offer a laundry room on every floor, is in a good position on campus, and has nicely sized rooms and bathrooms. Oh, and it's a girls' dorm.",

The dorm has the essentials and there are no suites, just 2-person dorms. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but it is a very open atmosphere. Most people, on the guys floor at least, kept their doors open and encouraged social interaction. I'm so happy I spent my freshman year there. In 2 weeks, though, I'm going to be moving off-campus.",

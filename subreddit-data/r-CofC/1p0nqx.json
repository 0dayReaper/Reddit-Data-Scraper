I feel like e-cigs should've been exempted, since they don't actually contain tar and would be a more acceptable alternative to running off campus for 5-10 minutes between classes. ",

You may see it at civil liberties being restricted but I think it's a good step in reducing the amount of cigarette butt litter all over campus and increasing the health of the students. I will miss enjoying my pipe late at night in the Cistern but I'll be graduated before the rule goes into effect. ",

I used to smoke and would go on the sides of buildings where there was lite to zero foot traffic. Surprise! Most smokers will venture to these areas. \n\nThe smoking students are a minority at this school, honestly. I mean, should we also ban people from blasting music from their headphones so everyone can hear?\n\nThe people that are complaining probably *feel* like they are surrounded by smokers but, they aren't. \n\nNow, on the other hand, from their point of view- it made quitting miserable having to see it and smell it. Designated smoking areas would be best. What about the commuter students on campus for 6 hours that smoke? They can't please everyone. \n\nHonestly though, the amount of people on such a compact campus will make it tough to enforce. ",

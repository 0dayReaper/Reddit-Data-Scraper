I've seen listings in the College of Charleston Class of 2017 group and I'm sure there are postings on the class group pages for 2018, 2019, etc. They are closed groups so you might have to request to join but I don't think it'll be an issue getting added in. Also there's an open group titled Housing and I've seen listings for subleasers in some of the free and for sale groups. Hope this helps! Enjoy Charleston.",

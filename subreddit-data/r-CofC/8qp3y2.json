    "postText": "im from Michigan and Charleston is basically my second home. I'll be a Junior 2018\\-2019 and I've been rushing to look for colleges or career paths, but the college part was the easy one. Literally been my dream college since I even started thinking about college. I've visited the campus, been to Charleston countless times, and know enough about it that you'd think i've been there for a year. I just have some questions and was wondering if i'd even be eligible!!!!\n\nSo first off, i'm 51 out of 224 with a 3.6917 gpa (lets just call it 3.7). I know that the CofC gpa average is around 3.75 (or so I read on my college search website) and I plan on taking AP next year. I know being out of state tuition would be around maybe 40,000 a year (yikes) but i've heard colleges want out of state students so they give scholarships!!!\n\nSO now the questions:\n\n1 \\- Do you think I would be easily accepted in with my current 3.7?\n\n2 \\- Do you think the fact that I am taking General Studies at U of M this year would affect anything at all?\n\n3 \\- I'm interested in english or international studies or psychology (im sooo open to everything tho and i know cofc offers at least 2/3 of these programs) is that something they would accept?\n\n4 \\- Would my familiarity with campus and Charleston help me into admission?\n\nALSO!!!\n\nany tips for getting in?!!?! literally my dream college!!! id also like some tips for career paths lol, so unsure about it. thank you !!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*EDIT: yea i checked again and turns out the average is 3.9!

            "comment": "They do like to give out scholarships, I think a lot based around SAT, ACt, and state-issued test scores, so did you score high on those in high school? \nBased on my experience going to CofC from 2009-2013:\n1 - yes\n2 - I loved and kind of picked this college because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. They don\u2019t make you pick a major early, and it seems even if you choose or switch yours pretty late in your college career it won\u2019t make you take many extra classes, if any at all. \n3 - When I was there they had all of these, and different denominations of each.\n4 - No, but it might help you not trip over the bricks ever morning the first few weeks  of class!",

            "comment": "Hey Im currently enrolled in College of Charleston. You'll definitely get accepted. I had a 3.4 and I was accepted so I'd say anything above that will definitely get accepted. ALSO Cofc loves accepting out of state students. They just gain more diversity and MONEY. I love College of Charleston so much and its just an overall great school. You don't have to 100&amp;#37; know what you want to do right away either. I know plenty of English/Psychology majors and they all say its very interesting and rather easy.  As for int. studies, my roommate was very set on being an int. studies major then she took her first class for the major and realized it was boring (in her opinion) and didn't want to do it anymore. And thats the great thing about this school, its a lot of trial and error. Just take a wide range of classes and you'll figure out what you want to do. Familiarity with the campus won't do much for admission, they honestly won't really care. But it will help you a lot. However, I've lived in Charleston all of my life and I still had no idea where my classes were lol. Also make sure to include your extracurriculars, you'll really need them if your GPA is on the lower side. \n\nSome tips for career paths: Cofc has very good business and computer science programs. I'd definitely look into it, if you're interested in either one. But there are so many majors and minors and you'll definitely find one you like. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

            "comment": "you're going to get in. they definitley want out of state students. scholarships for students are VERY comptetive because COFC is a public institution and doesn't have stacks of cash to give out to students.. the most common institutional scholarship that I have seen for out of state students is around 10,000 but there could be more out there that I am not aware of. The budget for an out of state student is around 50,000 (mega yikes), just be sure this is where you want to go and that you are comfortable with the COA because if you were one of the lucky ones to get a institutional scholarship that is only 10,000 knocked off 50,000 so thats an extra 40,000/ year to pay out of pocket or in loans after graduation. If you're considering majoring in the studies you listed above, COFC is a great school for those areas. However, as a student studying STEM... If I could go back I probably would of chose another institution with more consentrations and options for the path I am pursuing. I have visitied other campuses around the country and was totally shocked by their STEM facilities compared to the ones that we have at COFC. Some may disagree with me and I am not trying to discourage you from applying- I am just giving my honest opinion... know exactly what you are getting out of what you're paying before you hop right in.

                            "comment": "Hi, sure. I started out biology and switched to computer science. While our building is awesome for the space that we have (Charleston is small as we both know)....I feel that the college doesn't offer enough courses within my major to specialize in a field of study. I toured a couple other universities that my younger sibling is interested in attending and their computer science facilities were pretty extraordinary(way more labs, tech, study space) and their course selections were impressive. As a senior approaching graduation, I can honestly say (shamefully) that I don't have a special focus because there is simply not enough opportunity for me to discover a focus. I feel that I have gotten a broader education and I wish that I had more options to hone in on something like AI, Machine Learning, etc.. . I'm not saying that there are zero cool courses that spike my interest BUT those awesome courses are filled up 2 minutes after registration because everyone is eager for a chance to learn something new. So- in conclusion. I guess my disappointment shouldn't be directed towards all STEM facilities, but rather the limited number of options one can pursue with the current course offerings in the CS department and the need for more labs to explore different areas of the field in a hands on atmosphere.

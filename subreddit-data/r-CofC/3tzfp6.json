Im down to drop someone off between here an there as long as they can split some driving with me. I dont really give a shit if we split expenses, I was gonna have to pay for the gas anyways. I just dont want to have to do all the driving. If your interested you have to like dogs, the only reason im driving up is cause my dog is too large to be crated on a plane.\nLet me know if anyone is interested.\nThanks \nTabor",

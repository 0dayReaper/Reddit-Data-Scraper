            "comment": "Honestly, regardless of what other people say, I lived in college lodge and absolutely loved it! I started out my year in Berry and after 5 or 6 weeks ending up switching to lodge. It's two people per bathroom (private in your room), larger rooms from my perspective, and you are right in the center of everything. I will also say having the outdoor balconies was a blessing! I spent probably 80% of my time chilling outside on the balcony and my friends constantly came over to chill on the balcony with me.\n\nI also felt that the community in college lodge was so much more comfortable and welcoming then berry. I was friends with all my neighbors in lodge unlike berry where I knew maybe one of my neighbors.\n\nI don't have much experience in Liberty (I didn't live there and neither did my friends) but from the minimal time I did spend there I felt it was very similar to Berry.",

I\u2019m living in George this year so fingers crossed",

    "postText": "I have been hearing about student's protesting the instillation of a Chick-fil-a on campus. My question is why does this have to be such a big deal? If you do not agree with Chick-fil-a don't eat there. I understand this is a touchy subject but I have to be honest sometimes people do get too easily offended. No matter what you say you are more than likely going to offend someone and if we boycotted every business that offended someone, our economy would be even worse off. I am not for or against gay rights. I am just wondering what yall's take on this is?\n\nedit: sorry there seems to be some confusion. I am aware that there is already a chick-fil-a on campus. I was talking about the instillation of a NEW one. ",

The college supports Chick-fil-A by having one of their restaurant's on campus where other students will purchase their food. Chick-fil-A will then take that profit and donate it to the hateful organizations that they are in full support of. That's where this becomes a big deal. Like you said, I don't have to eat there, but ultimately the money I pay in tuition, however small it may be, still goes towards Chick-fil-A in some way and that is something that does not sit right with me.

I\u2019m probably more interested if there are any that are being specifically avoided though lol. \n\nIf there is any help from current students on any of the first year seminars, that\u2019d be super helpful too!\n\nThe only information I have about them is from \u201cRate my Professors\u201d, so if there\u2019s any other resources anyone has about them, it\u2019d be super appreciated!",

Couvares is  a super cool dude and not terribly difficult as a grader, plus his lectures are all super funny. If you take him, just don\u2019t sit right next to him while he\u2019s lecturing because he\u2019s kinda got a bit of stank breath",

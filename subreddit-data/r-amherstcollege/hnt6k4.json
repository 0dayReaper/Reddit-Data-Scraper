My understanding is that he left in 2007 with an explicit promise that no one at Amherst would ever hear from him again, even those with whom he was very close. He kept that promise according to folks I\u2019ve spoken with. Last night I searched again but this time I found him: he died at age 61 from a heart attack on 9/13/22. Just devastating. :/",

There is unquestionably more to the story that is intentionally not public. My hunch is that his popularity with students and personal eccentricity didn\u2019t earn him friends with the mainstream dept, certain logicians in particular, but I really don\u2019t know. Whatever it was, it was not an amicable parting and he explicitly cut off all ties with everyone Amherst-related, including people who had been very close with him. It\u2019s really tragic. I didn\u2019t realize until he died, but I always thought we\u2019d have a chance to reconnect.",

That person (who was extremely close with TP) confirmed that they\u2019d been notified by his little sister that he\u2019d died, but also that TP had never returned their many calls/emails since 2007. The sister had sent them the link to the Medium obit, and they passed it on to me. I ruminated about this for like two weeks when I learned. It\u2019s the worst.",

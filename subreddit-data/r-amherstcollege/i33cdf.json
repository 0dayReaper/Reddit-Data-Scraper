    "postText": "I have read that Amherst College does not really have weed out classes, but that the science classes are particularly difficult.  Are the science classes graded on a curve? Any classes graded on a curve?  For anyone that has taken science classes at Amherst and the corresponding AP or IB in high school, can you describe the level of difficulty? Did you feel prepared because you had those classes in hs? How large are the intro classes?Also, I  read about SURF research opportunities. Any idea how difficult it is to be selected (ie. not many spaces for the number of students interested?  Lastly, is there grade deflation/inflation? Thank you",

            "comment": "I am an alumnus who studied science and graduated fairly recently. Science classes (and essentially all classes) are graded on a curve, though what they are curved to varies by professor and/or department and should be set out in the syllabus.  Some classes have a specific number of As, A-s, etc. each semester (e.g. intro econ), others have traditional bell curves (e.g. chemistry department classes).\n\nI took AP physics B and C in high school, both of which were very rigorous but I felt prepared me well for introductory physics.  I would still recommend taking the intro classes because departments sometimes have preferred methodologies for problem solving and are definitely more intense than an AP level course. I did not take advanced biology or chemistry courses in high school and found both to be very approachable in college.\n\nIntroductory classes range in size depending on department and in which semester you take them. For example, traditionally premed students take CHEM-151 first semester, PHYS-115 and CHEM-161 second semester, and progress from there.  I took PHYS-123 first semester and CHEM-151 and PHYS-124 second semester which made all of those classes ~30 students (much smaller than the regular cycle).  When I took organic chemistry, it was the largest class on campus at 110 students, but most fall into the 30-60 range.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know much about SURF, though I did know a few people who did it and professors are great resources to whom you can direct questions (and they actively promote SURF so they would be more than happy to talk to you).  As far as I know there isn't grade inflation, but I don't know anybody who felt that they received grades out of line with their performance in class (science or otherwise).\n\nOverall, I loved studying science at Amherst and I think that having engaged professors who are there because they love teaching cannot be overstated. They also rely very little on rote memorization but focus instead on thought process and problem solving using available information and resources which I really appreciated. Feel free to reply or PM me with any other questions and Roll Mammoths!",

They both loved the professors and felt that the theoretical framework Amherst teaches was really valuable as they started looking for jobs.\n\nAs far as club sports are concerned, Amherst doesn't have a ton (the biggest four by far when I was there were ultimate, rugby, soccer, and crew). Intramurals are really easy to get involved with; I played basketball every year with guys I met playing pick-up. It's also very easy to find other people with whom to play and many have loosely organized group chats where people will plan times to play. Finally, the equipment room access as a student is great and allowed me to rent equipment to try squash with a group of my friends which ended up becoming a regular activity for us in spite of the fact that none of us had played before college.",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t answer everything in here, because I haven\u2019t taken science courses besides Psych and CS, but I went to TA hours with my friend who majors in Physics so I can answer some things?\n\nSo I took AP Physics C, and the Intro physics at Amherst is definitely harder. Like, it\u2019s the same topics so nothing was completely incomprehensible, but the homework questions were definitely a level above what I had been doing. The TA for physics was great though (definitely go to TA hours!!!)\n\nThe intro classes tend to be larger in Amherst, but nothing crazy. A lot I\u2019ve seen have been around 40-50 people, with smaller sections for labs if needed.\n\nI don\u2019t know enough about the SURF program, but I hope you figure it out!\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been major grade inflation at Amherst, but I know that it\u2019s not as hard as some college courses. As long as you go to TA hours and office hours and everything, you should get at least an ok grade.\n\nI know most of the classes I\u2019ve been in have been graded on a curve, especially if the class does unexpectedly badly on something.\n\nI\u2019m also going to respond to your follow up questions cause why not lol.\n\nI\u2019m a CS major, but I skipped the intro courses so I\u2019m talking about what I\u2019ve seen from my friends in them. They tend to be an ok pace, with intro 1 and 2 being about equal to the AP. You learn Java, which imo is a good starter language for CS. The teachers are lovely and super supportive, and I know most of them are super chill on extensions. \n\nAs for clubs, I\u2019m in horse riding, but Idk about the other club sports. Riding is actually fairly chill for beginners, and we usually have 2-3 new people a year who go in an intro group together. The club provides all the equipment you need as well.\n\nGood luck with everything!",

            "comment": "I am a current Biology, psychology double major who has just about finished the requirements for both majors. None of my classes have been graded on a curve. Once, one of my professors talked about changing to a curve if he thought it would boost the class's grades, but I don't think he ended up doing it.\n\nAs for the difficulty of the classes, I am a transfer student, and the effort that got me a 4.0 at the school I transfered from got me a B+ average at Amherst. I don't feel like the classes were very hard though. I slacked a lot and did not study, so I probably deserve what I have. \n\nI don't know for sure about the surf program, but I heard that the majority of the students who go for it get in.",

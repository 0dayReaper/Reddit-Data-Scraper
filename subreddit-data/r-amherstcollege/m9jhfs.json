Will people be able to come onto campus if herd immunity doesn't work? What will vaccine stuff at Amherst look like for those who have autoimmune conditions or just underlying medical conditions? \n\nI saw that some colleges felt that it was immoral to require it and that for other colleges it's not a matter of if but when they can legally mandate it. Where does Amherst stand on it?",

I don't think any college will.\n\nHowever, a more important question is \"Will Amherst allow personal reasons (philosophical) as justifications for not getting the vaccine?\" And I personally think Amherst will not allow personal reasons.",

I had heard that the college is pretty liberal and supportive of a lot of different views and stuff. I was looking up personal reasons others might have for not taking the vaccine and it said there's a justified weariness \"because of the country\u2019s history of racist treatment in the medical realm.\" I'm kinda surprised Amherst wouldn't consider that since they seemed so \"be whoever you want to be\" on paper.",

My intuition is partly based off this \n\n[https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx)\n\nas Mass only allows religious exemptions. I see this being another exemption, but personal exemptions feels a bit of a stretch. \n\nRegarding the medical racism you point out, I don't see it winning out over protecting our faculty (many who are really old) and our community. It's your choice to not get the vaccine and it's also Amherst's choice to not let you back on campus.",

Thank you so much for sharing that link. I saw that someone down voted my response to you. Is there something I said about the college that was wrong? I'm still weighing my options so I'd love to hear anything else you wanna share about Amherst (good or bad)",

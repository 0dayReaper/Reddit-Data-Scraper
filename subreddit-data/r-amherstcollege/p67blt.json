As far as I know, registration opens at the same time for everyone and you need your advisor to approve it before you can register.\n\nOn the same topic, you normally get all the classes you want so really don't sweat it. If you don't, speak to the professor, show up to class the first day, and make your case and they usually try to accommodate as much people as possible.",

However, when I reviewed my application, the testing section showed up empty. I have not sent my sat scores through collegeboard directly, so I\u2019m worried if they will even be considered.",

Some of my friends who applied to other colleges said the same and then we did some digging and found this: https://appsupport.commonapp.org/applicantsupport/s/article/Why-is-some-of-the-student-data-missing-from-the-application-preview-PDF\n\nSome colleges suppress testing information and if it doesn\u2019t appear on our version of the pdf, it\u2019s by design.",

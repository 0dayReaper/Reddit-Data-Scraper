Now as far as your fin aid application is concerned i really don\u2019t know.But what i can tell you is that when i was applying and i submitted 2-3 days later they told me that it\u2019s just fine and that the date they set is kind of a guideline and not a deadline. \nAlso i think that because you had a pretty serious reason it will be fine !!!",

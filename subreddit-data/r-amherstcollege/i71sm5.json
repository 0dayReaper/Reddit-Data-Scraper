    "postText": "Hi!! I'm a high school senior from India and I had a few questions about Amherst. Are they any cases of sexual assault, racism and other safety related issues? How safe would you call the campus? Are there a lot of international students? Is it hard for an international student to make friends? Is the environment friendly and relaxed or extremely competitive? How exactly does the housing system work? Does Amherst help international students get jobs after graduation, especially if one can't get a work permit in the US? Also, how good is the Studio/Fine arts department, it looks pretty new. Does Amherst arrange transport to and from the international airport? How exactly does the five college consortium work? Can one do a major/minor at those colleges or only short courses?",

            "comment": "Hi there! I graduated about 5 years ago so here's my attempt at answering the questions. Note that I'm sure this all is different in regards to COVID and obviously the school might've changed somewhat since I've been there:\n\n1. Not sure if you mean the town itself or just the campus. If you're looking for town crime stats that information is meant to be public, so I'm sure you can find that information on the Amherst town website. In terms of racism, I'd say the most common occurrence was microaggressions. My time at Amherst there was the Amherst Uprising which was a sit-in in the library to hold the school accountable for supporting the school's large, diverse population. \n2. general campus safety - I never felt unsafe on campus (as a woman). Not sure if it still exists, but during my time there was a safety van that you could call to pick you up and drop you off anywhere on campus. I never had an incident that required me to involve campus police, but I did have to call the campus EMT service for a friend. They responded quickly and were able to transport my friend to the nearest hospital.\n3. I believe when I attended Amherst there was a sizable international student population (I vaguely remember it being around 10% of the student body).\n4. I am not an international student, but I made quite a few international student friends (still have them to this day). There's an International Student Association to represent international student interests as well as a dedicated Dean who can assist students from everything to organizing trips to get US SIM cards to visa applications. There was also (again, this was during my time) an international student orientation where students would arrive a week earlier than the rest of the incoming students to bond, get settled, and have orientation leaders (other international students) discuss culture shock and life in the US. Because of this a lot of international students would be close with each other. But also, plenty of domestic students would have close friendships with international students. By no means were international students ignored. I would say my friends found that the hardest thing to connect with domestic students tended to be around American pop culture (especially if they weren't familiar with it).\n5. I would say that the environment at Amherst was extremely friendly. While the campus tended to divide itself between athletes and non-athletes, I never had a bad experience socializing with athletes. Academically, I think everyone really worked hard and pushed themselves, but people weren't competitive. If anything, I found the environment to be extremely collaborative. People would form study groups for STEM classes or you'd go with your friends to the library to study together. No one really tried to undercut anyone else for the sake of a grade.\n6. As for housing, you're guaranteed all 4 years to have a dorm room. That means that you will never be forced to live off-campus if you don't want to. Before your first year you are sent a questionnaire to fill out. It is short and essentially asks if you are messy or neat, are ok with smoking, or would prefer to live in substance-free housing (housing that has strict rules about alcohol and other drugs). You are automatically assigned one of the freshman dorms and a roommate. After that, there are two main routes to secure housing:\n   1. You go through a housing lottery where you are randomly ranked within your year. Then you are assigned a time to pick your desired dorm and room. The times are assigned based on seniority (i.e. rising seniors automatically get first pick). Obviously, the lower on the list you are, the less choices you have (and also the less ideal dorms/rooms). You can enter this lottery with a friend (typically this will be your roommate) or a group of up to 6 people. There's also a fun competition called Lip Sync where students will compete to gain the top slot of their year. \n   2. You can apply to be in a theme house/floor. There are various themes that range from living in a house that only speaks Spanish to a house that is focused on the arts.\n7. As for jobs as an international student, all my international friends were able to secure OPTs and work in the US after graduation, but the Dean of International Students is an extremely helpful resource for your job search in the US and guiding you on obtaining a work visa in the US. As for jobs outside of the US, I'm not too sure, but I do know from my own personal experience that the Career Center can be limited in terms of finding jobs beyond New York or Boston. But, they did encourage me to reach out to network alumni and there is an extensive international alumni network. \n8. The art department is not new at all! I have quite a few friends who were Art or Art History majors. I will say it isn't the most popular major, but they do a good job about giving support to students. I took a film class and we each were able to get our own camera to use for the entire semester and if we wanted more specialized equipment we could rent it (for free) from the Art Department. If you choose to do a senior thesis as an art major you are also provided a free studio that you can access anytime you'd like. \n9. Travel to/from the airport depends on which airport you're talking about. Bradley International Airport is about a 45min drive from campus and Boston International is around 2 hours. However, were many options even before Uber/Lyft arrived at Amherst. There was a local shuttle service that you could pay to go (I believe it was $40) to the closest airport (which is Bradley International). But the student government always organized free buses before the major holiday breaks (on a first-come/first-serve basis) to both Bradley and the Boston International Airport. Additionally, there was always a student or two who owned a car that would shuttle people to the airports (some for free or some for a fee). I also had friends who would buy a bus ticket to go to Boston (which costs about $20). There is also Uber/Lyft but I'm not sure how much that costs because I graduated before they arrived to Amherst.\n10. The 5 College Consortium basically means that you can take select classes at the other 4 colleges. You had to independently look for the classes you wanted to take and then petition Amherst to take them. For the most part, any class was fair game, but Amherst doesn't allow you to take classes they deem are pre-professional (say a Journalism class or an Accounting class) or a class that Amherst offers (you can't take intro to calculus at another school for example). You also have to make sure that you can easily get to class because you need to factor commuting. I took 2 classes outside of Amherst and enjoyed my experience! I will say that depending on the school you're taking classes that the rigor can be quite different. I found my two five college classes to be easier than any Amherst class.\n11. You can't have a minor at Amherst and you can't major in another 5 college, but there were these things called certificates that you could have if you achieved the required classes. Some certificates were easier than others to get. I believe there's one for international relations and another for marine biology, but you'd have to look them up (just google \"Five College Certificates\" and I'm sure you'd find the full list. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps!",

            "comment": "Tbh I don't think you should ED here. A rape happened last year and the authorities asked the victim to leave campus. So the point is you wouldn't want to go to such a school. Plus as previously said it is very difficult to make friends and plus the aid is very unpredictable usually worse than it's counterparts like Williams. Anyway it's yr call this is just my experience.",

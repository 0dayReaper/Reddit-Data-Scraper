    "postText": "Rising senior in HS, planning to apply ED to Amherst for premed. Had a few questions regarding specifically the premed program and the general school:\n\nPremed specifically:\n\n1. How accessible are research opportunities?\n2. How accessible are volunteer and service opportunities (shadowing, hospital volunteering, etc.).\n3. Do you feel as if the courses prepared you for the MCAT/med school?\n\nGeneral questions:\n\n1. Are students ranked based on GPA?\n2. How toxic is the student environment (saw a lot of negative comments online about the student environment)?\n3. Will I be left out if I don't play sports?\n4. Is there grade inflation/deflation?",

            "comment": "1. Research opportunities: all basic science, no computational research, no medical/engineering research. Get to work on independent projects but publishing rate is much slower than an R1. Pros are you get very good LORs from professors and research training, which are useful for applying to REUs. Get to go to conferences with professors. In short, possible to get a good research experience, but maybe not the type of research you want. \n\n2. Clinical opportunities: Not much. Cooley Dickinson is an option but might need a car. There\u2019s a hospice 15 min away by bus. Probably better to do shadowing during J-term or summer. \n\n3. Yes, courses will teach you the foundations relatively strongly. However, since depth over breadth is emphasized, you will need to read up on some MCAT material on your own. \n\nGeneral: \n\n1. No ranking. \n2. Not toxic. Premeds here are chill and most take gap years. Only 2-3 ppl per year who go straight in to med school. \n3. Nope. \n4. Moderate inflation. Honestly, grading here feels a little arbitrary. \n\nFigure out what you want as a premed in terms of opportunities. Amherst is a little limited imo, but plenty of ppl are successful with med school apps (though many take gap years and make up for those limitations after graduation). Feel free to PM me.",

The environment isn\u2019t toxic, I found that people are pretty nice overall and you can make friends if you put in decent effort. And you definitely won\u2019t be left out if you don\u2019t do any sports. I don\u2019t do any sports and most of the people I know don\u2019t either.",

            "comment": "1. If you are a good student and stand out, accessible. Professors regularly recruit students to help them with studies (though more in STEM than in humanities, but it still happens for the latter. A friend of mine is a phil research assistant). However, this is not a huge university, you will not get access to the same level of resources a huge college will have in terms of research (for instance, you can't work in a huge neuro lab doing fMRI studies).\n\nI'll skip questions 2-3 because I was not premed\n\nGeneral questions:\n\n1. Class ranks are private, people are not competitive about GPAs, except if you are in a group that is inclined that way. Grade inflation is out of control at Amherst, so everyone has a good GPA.\n2. No idea what people are complaining about. People are extremely non-competitive, friendly, and non-toxic. There is a bit of groupthink on the campus, though. The fact that it is so small means that it is hard to disagree with the majority. I don't think it's a big problem however.\n3. No, but athletics are a problem. The student-athlete divide is a big and there is definitely not a lot of crossover. I also think athletics is toxic af at Amherst, can elaborate if wanted. However, there are lots of non-athletes and parties are open  + many clubs so you do not need to be part of athletics to fit in, at all.\n4. Yes the grade inflation is completely out of control. The average grade is an A-, and it is nearly impossible to get below a B in most classes without trying to fail.",

I'm not premed and I don't have much comparison but I know lots of friends who were premed and got research opportunities, some going to postbacs at FancyPlaces\u2122, etc.\n\n...general...\n\n1. not as far as i know\n2. 2. There's a fair amount of (probably unfortunately typical) small elite liberal arts college complaining, but toxic is kinda a vague word.\n3. As mentioned by others, no, you'll be fine.\n4. I felt like there was grad inflation, but I get the sense that a lot of small elite liberal arts colleges do that. There were several courses where I thought I was just doing the standard and got an A+, and college was def. easier than high school for me. That said, idk if it's like that across majors, and I don't have any numbers to conclude anything with certainty about this",

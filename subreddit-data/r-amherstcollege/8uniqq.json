There a lot of opportunities, you just need a car to get to them as public transit doesn't efficiently connect you to the biggest hospitals. I volunteered at Baystate medical center in Springfield, lots of Amherst alums there. The Amherst premed advisor is an excellent resource and I would reccomend meeting with him in your first semester. Feel free to pm me",

Amherst, like many other schools, has a summer undergraduate research fellowship (SURF) program where many people get their first research experience. It is open to rising sophomores and juniors. Many students continue to work in their surf lab during the academic year. Because of this carry over of surf students, very few freshmen start working in labs immediately. After sophomore year you become more competitive for summer research internships at other institutions, but it is not impossible to get a summer research position as a freshmen. Best advice is if you are interested in a specific topic, look for a prof who is doing that type of research or something related. Speak with them about the topic, why you are interested, how you can get involved. They might now have an open spot in their lab, but may be able to refer you to colleagues at other institutions. Feel to pm me for general pre med advice aswell. Currently applying this cycle and recently admitted to Tufts Med. ",

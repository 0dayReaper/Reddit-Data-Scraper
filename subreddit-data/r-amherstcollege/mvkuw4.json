I will also add that I initially applied REA to Harvard, was deferred and then waitlisted, so I certainly understand the sentiment of wanting to attend a university like Harvard. During the college application process, however, I discovered many new things about myself (as you can tell, a lot of the schools I initially applied to didn\u2019t even resemble Amherst, but I doubt that I\u2019d be as happy there simply because I know myself better now). In the meantime, I was accepted to Amherst and decided to decline the waitlist accept.",

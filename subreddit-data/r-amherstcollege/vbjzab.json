    "postText": "So I submitted my financial aid info really late, like a week or two ago (but I've been in contact with the finaid office and they said it's fine), but I'm just wondering how long it'll take them to give me my financial aid package? \n\nAlso in the financial aid portal, it says on the actual page that you can see \"Awards\" and everything if you click on the three bars in the top left corner, but that doesn't show up for me. Does it only show up once you've actually been given a finaid package, or is there something wrong with my account?",

You'll still get internships and jobs at amazing places but if you are looking for a great undergrad CS experience, you will be left somewhat disappointed \n2. Mostly theoretical knowledge like data structures / algorithms so no specific industry knowledge. From my friends experience, jobs will usually train you to work with their specific tools / frameworks\n3. Amherst is known for having consulting / IB /finance recruiters come but I don't recall SWE / tech recruiters coming to Amherst. \n4. ehh, its alright, and umass is down the road if u really want to party",

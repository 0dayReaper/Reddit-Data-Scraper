    "postText": " Hello!\n\nI'm an incoming freshman at Amherst College and I'm interested in declaring a major in Mathematics or Statistics. I have a few questions regarding the Mathematics/Statistics experience at Amherst:\n\n* As an undergraduate at Amherst College, what opportunities are available for students interested in machine learning? Is it common for students to participate in research, whether through shadowing, volunteering, or scribing?\n* What is the typical outcome for students majoring in Math or Stat at Amherst College? Are Amherst graduates often admitted to top-tier schools?\n* I have been awarded work-study as part of my financial aid package. Can research in a laboratory count towards fulfilling my work-study requirement? \n* Looking back on your experience as a Math student at Amherst College, what are some things you wish you had done differently? Do you have any advice for succeeding academically and maintaining a high GPA at Amherst? \n\nI would appreciate any insights or personal experiences that you can share. Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Hey, first of all, congrats and welcome to the herd!\n\nI recently graduated last May with a double major in math and stats and so that's why my friend pinged me lol. I'll try to answer your questions briefly and if you have any more questions, feel free to dm me and we can continue the conversation in private.\n\n  \n**As an undergraduate at Amherst College, what opportunities are available for students interested in machine learning? Is it common for students to participate in research, whether through shadowing, volunteering, or scribing?**\n\nYes, for machine learning, that's mostly through the computer science department so I don't know much about that. I can connect you with some CS majors tho. Since we are an undergrad only institution, the students are the main focus and thus pool of researchers that professors select from. Moreover, because of our small size, it is very easy to reach out to professors and get involved in research. There's a program called SURF that basically guarantees you summer research your first year. There's also 4 other colleges nearby with plenty of opportunities of their own so you just got to reach out and see.\n\n  \n**What is the typical outcome for students majoring in Math or Stat at Amherst College? Are Amherst graduates often admitted to top-tier schools?**  \n\n\nI don't think I could pinpoint a typical outcome for students majoring in math or stats. The math major is one of the most popular majors at Amherst, most likely due to the amazing faculty such as the Benedettos, Zhang, Daniels, and Culiuc. The cool thing about the math / stat major is that the critical thinking skills and logic you develop are translatable to a variety of fields so people are doing a bunch of stuff. That stats major is relatively new but I think its growing in size each year and I think people who do stats often pair it with something else like psych or econ or cs so they have very certain interests so it really varies. I would suggest going on LinkedIn, look at people from amherst who majored in these majors and just stalk them to see what they are up to.\n\nIn academia, its often the faculty you work with that matters more than prestige so keep that in mind... but yes, Amherst people love doing more school, especially at top-tier schools. I'm doing a masters in biostatistics at Harvard right now. I know people doing PhDs in math at Berkeley, Brown, people are doing Phds in Stats at Columbia, Duke, Rice, a friend of mine majored in stats and psych and is doing a PhD in quantitative psych at UW. On the other hand, I know several people that are at Morgan Stanley, Hedgefunds, Consulting, whatever that shit is. I think Amherst is very  evenly split between people who go into industry and people who go in academia. But yes, Amherst graduates are often admitted to top-tier schools for a few reasons (not all):\n\n1. we can develop close relationships with professors that leads to amazing recc letters\n2. the undergrad focus means we get more research opportunities which gives us time to develop our passions and give us a good idea of what grad school entails\n\n  \n**I have been awarded work-study as part of my financial aid package. Can research in a laboratory count towards fulfilling my work-study requirement?**\n\nI'm so bad at the whole financial aid thing but I think the answer is yes.  \n**Looking back on your experience as a Math student at Amherst College, what are some things you wish you had done differently? Do you have any advice for succeeding academically and maintaining a high GPA at Amherst?**  \n\n\nI declared my math major actually my junior year so I was two years behind everyone. I wish I had taken more math classes early on. In my freshman year, I was strictly humanities but started to pivot during my sophomore year to stats then eventually stats and math. \n\nJust some general advice, go to Office Hours, get to know your professors. Start on the psets as soon as they are posted. Even if the material isnt covered yet or you don't know it, atleast read the questions and mull them over. Grade inflation is real so Idk if this is good ethical advice or whatever but imo I went to class everyday, participated in lectures, went to OH and overall demonstrated my engagement and my desire to learn the material and no matter how bad i did, the professors were chill and gave me a nice curve. \n\nI think because of our small size, the students and professors see and treat each other like humans, not a number or a random student, but humans with emotions and interests. Math and stats may seem very cold and objective but at Amherst, and I'm sure at any LAC, its full of life, eating pizza or pie on pi day discussing new areas of research, going into your professors office and asking them about their kids and how their pickleball game is, watching basketball together, its laughing over the dinner table and learning from one another.",

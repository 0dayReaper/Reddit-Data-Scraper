I\u2019m biased towards  Amherst because I go here but atleast I can give personal experience to the pros and cons. This person just spouts platitudes found in College Confidential",

You\u2019ll be fine, they don\u2019t use the track all the time and like someone else mentioned, running outside is nice. There\u2019s also basketball courts and stuff so you\u2019ll have plenty of space to run and work out. I know track uses the indoor track fields during winter time around like 4pm -6pm and there\u2019s always morning lift and various scheduling. You can actually look online at Amherst athletics website to see how the schedule looks and you can also schedule time too.",

Amherst does have some decent facilities, but the reality is students won\u2019t have constant free time to go running. There will likely be other responsibilities that may take priority over your exercising during your free time. Also, I totally blanked and forgot that Amherst has track. I read it as this student wants to participate in track but Amherst does not offer it, in which case I was saying that if participating in track is important to consider other schools that may offer that and weigh the pros and cons with amherst.",

We have one indoor track field that serves as a tennis court and a softball field and the outside track is super far away from campus. Stop with the trite sayings it doesn\u2019t help anyone. I\u2019m assuming from your name you go to JHU, please go on the JHU subreddit and give your personal experience.",

            "comment": "yes! u can def double major in those two. take classes to see if you enjoy ljst and cs and if you really like both, then double major but be sure to try out other classes as well! \n\n  \nlet me put it another way: most majors require 9-11 courses to finish the major; over the course of your amherst experience, you will take approx 32 courses. two majors will then lets say take \\~20 of those classes. And if you want to do a thesis, that's two more classes in your senior year (1 per sem). \n\nso its definitely doable but also many professors will advise against double majoring and my two cents are: if you really like these two majors then do it but if you are doing it because you think it will help you in the job market (ur going to a lac for petes sake lol) and you can brag about it or its some kind of prestige thing, then I would highly suggest you to reevaluate your decision. Amherst contains a brilliant and diverse set of majors and courses. Try a course from each department, it could change your mind.",

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware already but just because you\u2019re prelaw doesn\u2019t mean you need to or even want to take LJST or polisci or whatever. You can legit major in anything in undergrad, just do what you like. I know people who are econ music English math majors that went on to do law. My friend is a religious studies major but is also premed so definitely Broaden your horizons.",

But no, Amherst is incredibly well connected to Wall Street / Consulting / IB. You can get any job go to any grad school with an Amherst degrees just like you can at any perceived elite institution. My point, to be clearer, is that any degree you get at Amherst or any other LAC, Is less important than getting some degree. A liberal arts degree is more indicative that you\u2019re well rounded and can critically think and less focused on what that degree is.",

I think I am a strong student, but I have no clue what to expect from college-level academics. Especially not from a school with a reputation like Amherst. I would imagine that there are some students who do not care that much about school, and then there are some try hards. Do think being one of the \"better\" students at Amherst is hard, or do most people just fall in with the pack?\n\nthanks for responding to my last question btw!",

Most Amherst students are very down to earth, some of the smartest people I know are the most humblest. People here aren\u2019t cutthroat so don\u2019t worry about being the best or whatever, go at your own pace is what Amherst is teaching me :)",

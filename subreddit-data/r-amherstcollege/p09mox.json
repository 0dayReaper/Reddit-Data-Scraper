    "postText": "I am so stressed and worried rn, I can\u2019t take it anymore.\nHere are the facts:\n- I am an international \n- I have a 3.5 unweighted GPA; my school doesn\u2019t weigh, but if they did, my GPA would be higher\n- there is an upward trend in my transcripts\n- I am applying ED to Amherst\n- I sent the office of admission an email explaining why I screwed up in the first two years of high school, and they replied to me, saying that my email will be included in my application and undergo a holistic review\n- alumni of my high school who got into Amherst during the previous years have VERY impressive applications, so the AOs should know that I am nothing compared to those alumni, and it makes me sad\n- a have a certificate of merit for excellence in academic performance lol (I became a straight A student in junior year of hs)\n- other parts of my application are pretty good; I have a research paper and poetry publications, awards from national and international competitions, projects, work experience, volunteering, an internship at a newspaper (even got a letter of gratitude from the chief editor), and a bunch of career-oriented ECs\n\nNow, my question: is there anyone who got into Amherst despite their \u201clow\u201d GPA? \n\nI am hopeless, so I need a little bit of hope because I don't want to be depressed anymore.\n\nPlease, help me to calm down; my hair is going grey and falling out :(",

            "comment": "They are 100% willing to over look bad grades in the past. I had a 0.9 GPA in high school, and then transferred into Amherst from a community college with a 4.0 at the CC. After spending a few years at Amherst, I get the impression admissions are more interested in collecting etcentrics than min-maxing their student body's credentials.",

Just create your narrative around that spike and if you have any identities pertinent to you (first gen low income etc) make sure to include it as well. Amherst loves diversity and I think you could have a decent shot!",

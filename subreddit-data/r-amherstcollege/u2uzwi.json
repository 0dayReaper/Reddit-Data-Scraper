    "postText": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nI have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/amherst) and I am really excited to share it with you.\n\nYou can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.\n\nLastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.\n\nEnjoy!!",

            "comment": "Ages ago at Amherst, on the last day that each class met, students filled out a course survey.  Results were compiled into a publication for all students to see, with the express intent of helping students know which classes were better or worse, easier or harder, etc.  I remember finding out, too late, that my Greek professor was by far the lesser rated of the two who taught the course.  (How is Rick Griffiths still at Amherst after 50 years?  He was the better rated professor.)\n\nIf my memory serves, the publication was called Scrutiny and it was a student-run publication.  Does that not exist anymore?  If not, I wonder when it disappeared, why, and how:  with a bang or with a whimper?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nSo I applied RD to Amherst for this fall, and (on the off chance I get in\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc hahah) I was just wondering how easy it is for students to create a club sport team. In my case, I love lacrosse but Amherst doesn\u2019t have a women\u2019s team:( I hoped to continue playing and I don\u2019t know how likely it is that I\u2019d make it as a walk on lol.\n\nI get that it also depends on participation so hopefully there are some fellow lax players out there or people involved in athletics that know of an interest in this sort of thing!",

Perhaps you\u2019ll learn a bit or be able to make friends from that team.\n\nIf you petition student government for a new club sport, they will tell you that lacrosse exists via varsity athletics and it doesn\u2019t make sense to fund a new club lacrosse program. One way of making your argument might be to find a club league around the five colleges to give people a reason to play. Does Mt Holyoke or Smith have a club team Amherst could play (or you could just join frankly, some clubs at other places allow that).\n\n*I graduated in 2010 so things may be different. I went to student gov for funds for a club so know a bit about that process.",

    "postText": " \n\nHey there!\n\nI\u2019m a prospective student who is interested in studying Chemistry. I was wondering if anyone would be open to speak on their experience being in the Chemistry major? Are there many research opportunities and connections to internships and jobs?  Is it a supportive learning environment in the classroom and labs? Does it matter that it will be a B.A. when you graduate?\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "Not a chem major myself, but pretty close I guess, so I\u2019ll speak on everything besides the chem department itself. If your focus is on the research side, then you\u2019ll have the option of doing SURF, which will have you do research with a professor in the department over the summer. After that, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for independent research with professors over the next school years or summers. If you want to go beyond that to a bigger research university, then you\u2019d probably have to an REU internship, to which the professors are pretty well connected with. If your goal is to go into industry straight out of undergrad though, there are still lots of opportunities (a B.S. or B.A. doesn\u2019t matter btw), but I would probably say that, unless your goal is to do a PhD, you\u2019d probably be better off at a larger university that\u2019s more well connected to the industry sector. The learning environment is a big plus at Amherst. You\u2019ll have the benefit of classes with no curves, which in turn fosters a very non-competitive collaborative environment with your classmates. The professors are usually very accessible, and provide plenty of opportunities to work in their labs, so research opportunities during the school year are not too hard to find if you\u2019re passionate about a specific topic.",

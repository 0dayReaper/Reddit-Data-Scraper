As I\u2019m going through info about the school I\u2019m still in love with it, but one thing I\u2019ve noticed is a lack of info on the dorms/living situations. I might just be missing something, but if anyone could tell me a bit more about housing(and how the school managed to have 35 dorms!) I\u2019d appreciate it!",

            "comment": "Hey, congratulations on getting into Amherst! \n\n* Do we really have 35 dorms that's crazy. Under normal conditions, as a first year, you will live in the quad which consists of Appleton (Crappleton or Trappleton depending on who's living there that year), North, South, James, Stearns (my old dorm) and Charles Pratt (the nicest and newest dorm, if you've been on a tour this is the dorm they show to impress the kids, it looks like a mansion).\n* Like other schools, you'll fill out a housing application indicating your preferences like time of waking up, drugs, noise levels, etc and then they try the best to match you up. I'm not sure if you can choose your roommate freshman year but you can create living groups the following years.\n* The dorms themselves aren't nothing special. Pretty big with two desks and drawers each.\n* You can ask for a single if you have accommodations or needs of whatever.\n* No AC so a fan is like a must when its hot and when its cold its fine. You can say you have asthma or something to get one but then you won't get the experience of sweating your butt.\n* You can choose/or indicate you want to be in an all boys or all girls floor or coed. \n* Each floor has its own RA or RC or CA or whatever that will buy you snacks and have tea time!\n* Each floor also has a common area where you can hang out and study together with the rest of your floor mates. \n* No kitchens besides a microwave and fridge. Kitchens are in upperclassmen dorms like Newport or Marsh House.\n* If you do come to Amherst, the best dorms imo are Greenway/Weiland/King (upperclassman tho), they feel the most modern and have kitchens and the rooms are bigger.\n* Beds are standard, make sure to invest in a mattress topper\n* I think you get 4 hangers for free \n* Make sure to establish guidelines with your roommate early on and stick to them.\n\nGoodluck deciding!",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the reply, much appreciated! It sounds like Amherst dorms are pretty normal, although it sucks to hear about the AC. If I can ask, is there any particular reason that Appleton is known as \u201cCrappleton?\u201d Also, unrelated but something I\u2019m curious about: How\u2019s dining there? I\u2019ve seen some people really praise the food on campus, but others complain that it\u2019s not good at all. It kind of factors into housing and living so I figured I\u2019d ask lol.",

                            "comment": "Actually, they renovated Appleton so it looks pretty good now. I think Appleton used to be a building where they kept lab animals or something like that, but Appleton and Williston (which I forgot to mention oops) are the two smallest dorms in terms of building size and room size. It's also fun to name things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFood is pretty good. As a FLI student from a public high school where the pizza was literal cardboard, the foods good to me. I think if you're picky, then it might be bad but if you're like \"food is food\" then you'll be fine. Also Amherst is continually improving it's menu and food options so it's actually decent now. Maybe not during the pandemic but ... \n\nIf people tell you the food sucks, ask them when they went there and if it's pre-2015, their opinion is no longer valid imo",

One last semi unrelated question if that\u2019s okay- does the cold get really extreme up there? I\u2019m coming from a warmer climate that\u2019s only really cold for a couple months a year, so I\u2019m just trying to get a handle on what I might be in for if I head up to MA lol.",

I definitely don\u2019t want just one season all year round though, so it\u2019s nice they\u2019re so distinct! So another question I\u2019ve been wondering about is the workload. Would you say pretty much everyone was always stressed out, or did it become manageable after a few months? Plenty of people talk about how rigorous everything is, but it oftentimes seems like they sugarcoat it a little bit. Part of what drew me to Amherst was it\u2019s academic rigor, but I shied away from schools like Swarthmore because I didn\u2019t want to spend all of my time buried in books cramming for tests. How would you characterize it?",

I think we have a really good work-life balance and no one is constantly stressed out. If they are, then they probably are spreading themselves thin. At one point, I was taking 4.5 classes, working 3 jobs, in two clubs and still had time to go to the gym and hang out with friends. but then again, I'm not the most academic person at Amherst. You will not die here if you come here. Life works out",

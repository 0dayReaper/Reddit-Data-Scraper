But a lot of it is really up to chance, and even if you don't get in, it doesn't mean you don't deserve to be here (or at a top school). My test scores/GPA were a little higher than yours, but again, I've never been nationally/internationally recognized for anything, not even close. I think you have a good shot. Let me know how it turns out.",

    "postText": " Johns Hopkins vs. University of Florida vs. Amherst College\n\nHello, I'm a High school senior trying to decide between these three schools. I'm pretty sure that I'd get better grades at UF and I also have an easier time, but I have heard a lot about how good of a school Hopkins is for Med school and how it has a way higher Med school acceptance rate than the national average. I have also heard how Amherst College (the little ivy) has a high med school acceptance rate and will let me build better connections with professors. I've also heard about Hopkins' difficultness and grade deflation which worries me. I've always wanted to go to a T10 college since I started High school but my end goal is Med school and I was wondering if anyone could give me advice about what to do or about the Pre-med program at UF, JHU, or Amherst College.\n\nIs Hopkins really a better option or should I just go to UF? or should I go to Amherst? PLEASE HELP I LOVE ALL THESE SCHOOLS :(\n\nI got a full ride at these schools too so cost isn't an issue. Thank you in advance.",

            "comment": "This is a tough question to answer because they're all very different schools.  I'm a current M1 student who attended Amherst and I personally loved going to liberal arts school and the premed counseling and support are incredible there.  I would say the pros of a school like Amherst compared to the others are getting to take a wide variety of classes (many people who enter college wanting to go to medical school elect to go a different route, even those who are quite certain that's what they want to do going in), you'll get the opportunity to know professors well which would help with letters of recommendation, you would likely have more leadership opportunities with student groups due to the smaller size, and the premed office is amazing and will know who you are (I am still in touch occasionally with the premedical dean and he is wonderful).\n\nThe downsides I would say are that you will have fewer opportunities for research, at least that which is directly related to medicine (at least that are offered on campus), upper level science courses may not directly translate to a medical curriculum as much as other schools, and you obviously do not have an associated medical school with the campus for easy access to shadowing and such.  The setting is obviously very different between at least JHU and Amherst (I know nothing about Gainesville so can't speak to that) which was certainly a plus for me but probably isn't the right choice for everybody.\n\nI also agonized between a few different schools and by the time I had been a student at Amherst for two months I never even thought about the choice because I had more pressing things to think about.  My best advice would be to choose the place you're going to be happiest for the next 4 years; it won't be worth getting to medical school if you've burnt yourself out along the way.  All of my classmates are amazing people with a wide range of backgrounds and now more so than ever there is no one path to this profession.  Happy to answer any questions you have here or in PMs and best of luck!",

            "comment": "Since cost isn't an issue, I think Amherst and JHU are definitely your best choices. Both Amherst and JHU will set you up incredibly well for med school in terms of academics and advising, so it comes down to culture and location. I'm from Baltimore and have spent a lot of time on and around the Hopkins campus, and can definitely say geographically it's a great place to be. It doesn't feel cramped, Baltimore is an awesome unconventional college town, and DC and NY are great day trips.\n\nI would side with Amherst in terms of culture. Hopkins is definitely more competitive than collaborative, and courses are less intimate. It's still a mid-size university so you won't necessarily be reduced to a number, but it's really easy to feel isolated there. Amherst is an incredibly small and tight-knit community with a super collaborative vibe. The open curriculum is also a plus for pre-med, since you'll get the chance to explore outside of your major and pre-med requirements.\n\nCongrats for getting into these schools, they're all great choices! It all comes down to where you think you'll be happiest and what you're most comfortable with. Whatever you choose, I'm sure you'll be set up well for your future and I wish you the best of luck.",

            "comment": "Sorry, I don't really see why you would ever go to the University of Florida in your situation. Don't get me wrong, it's a great school, but when you have Johns Hopkins and Amherst covering your fees, the choice is clearly between those two, as they will lead you into very strong career paths and med schools. I think you should decide if you want to go to a rural LAC or a city university. They're both fantastic places, I suggest you check the area out on google street view to see where you'll be, look at vlogs, etc. Take part in their online meetings, sit in on classes, etc, see what you like more! You'll get into a fantastic medical school from either of them, but please don't go to Florida when you have a choice between some of the best schools in the country! They provide fantastic academic support too, so don't be worried about stuff like grade deflation, you got this :)",

Being in Baltimore will give you so many opportunities that will allow you to delve into the pre-med/medial field. They do deflate grades, but med school takes a 3.5 at JHU better than a 4.0 at Amherst. If you are serious about med school, go with JHU all the way! I\u2019ve read that JHU is in the top 25 for colleges with the highest med school acceptance rates. There are so many opportunities there and it is an amazing school for pre-med.",

    "postText": "Hi I\u2019ve been admitted to the class of 2025 and I had a couple questions about life at Amherst\n\n- Is the culture at Amherst competitive? Community based? \n- Do Amherst students typically find themselves overworked?\n- does anyone have experience with zipcars and how they work? \n- do Amherst students socialize with other colleges in the area or do they stick to people on their own campus?\n- has anyone had experience working on the book and plow farm? \n- how has Amherst prepared you for post graduate life? \n\nThanks so much for the help!",

            "comment": "Hey, congratulations on getting into Amherst first of all! Take some time to relax and enjoy life right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Is the culture at Amherst competitive? Community based?\n\nI would say the culture is definitely community based. We don't run into issues at bigger universities where people are competing for a limited number of spots, there's enough seats at the dinner table for everyone. I can speak more about the STEM department, but we really emphasize group work/projects and collaboration. This is great preparation for someone like me who wants to go into public health research where the work is interdisciplinary and collaborative.\n\n&gt;Do Amherst students typically find themselves overworked?\n\nI think if you're a nerd then yes hehe but for the most part no. People have good work-life balances here and Amherst encourages it. My friend tried to take 6 classes (God knows why) and his advisor shut him down immediately. During this pandemic, Amherst even dropped the number of classes from 4 to 3 to make it easier for us studying remotely while giving you the option to take 4 if you want. They even made flexible grading and pass fail options to alleviate the additional stress from online learning.\n\n&gt;does anyone have experience with zipcars and how they work?\n\nYeah so you have to get a membership (student is around $70 iirc) and there's one lot near campus behind the police station that usually has like 5-6 cars. There's a lot in downtown Amherst and some at UMass. I'd say demand is pretty high while supply can be limited. And last time I checked, an hour was like \\~$10. It's just like renting a car but more scuffed since cleaning and maintenance is like weekly as opposed to after each use. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;do Amherst students socialize with other colleges in the area or do they stick to people on their own campus?\n\nI think that's for you to decide. We have several colleges nearby and Amherst definitely feels like a bubble sometimes, a really nice comfortable bubble that you don't need to escape from but if you do, there's a lot of explore. For me, I've made friends from UMass, Smith, Mt. Holyoke, and Hampshire College. I go to talks at these places, get food at these places, and explore the cities. Northampton is super cute and Smith's campus is so freaking gorgeous. If you have a chance go to Florence Pie Bar in Florence MA. The owner plays piano for Amherst's Choral Society and the pies are absolutely amazing.\n\n&gt;has anyone had experience working on the book and plow farm?\n\nI know some people that do it and I visited it for an environmental studies class before and I heard it's really nice. You get to learn how to work on a farm on a smaller scale and the food you grow varies by season but it all gets used at Val (our dining hall) so you really feel like your work has an impact for the environment and for the school.\n\n&gt;how has Amherst prepared you for post graduate life?\n\nI can't answer this one since I'm still an undergraduate so I'll let an alum answer this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoodluck in deciding where to go and I'm happy to answer any more questions.",

I was just admitted to 2025 as well so I can\u2019t answer those questions lol, but we have a zee mee gc that\u2019s super active with other students and a ton of upperclassmen who are hanging around and answering questions. There\u2019s also a discord where you can ask that stuff too!",

            "comment": "1.) Community based for sure. Even for the most competitive parts of campus (getting summer research) students are more supportive of one another than trying to sabotage or put down.\n2.) Being overworked 100% depends on what classes you take, double check with an advisor or someone who took the class to know your workload. Most students are at a point where they\u2019re worked very hard, but it\u2019s manageable. \n3.) No, actually.\n4.) Amherst students (in a non-COVID year) will socialize a bunch with the other Five College Consortium colleges. Chiefly UMass Amherst but every campus is fair game. In fact, to complete a certificate you are allowed to attend courses at any of the other colleges and vice versa, my history class right now has a UMass student in it.\n5.) Ive worked on the farm before, lots of fun and a big change of pace. Miss Maida is wonderful and the work is fulfilling. It\u2019s cool picking food and seeing it in the dining hall a week later.\n6.) Have yet to graduate, check back in on me in four years.",

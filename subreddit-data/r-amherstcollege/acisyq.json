I feel blindsided by this -- I was expecting an A- in the class since I've put in my all through the semester; had a B+ going into final and left the final feeling great.\n\nI feel I'm really close to a B+ -- is it worth asking to meet with my professor and discuss bumping up my grade especially if I'm close? Has anyone ever done this before and what happened? Really hoping for some hope.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA bummed freshman \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

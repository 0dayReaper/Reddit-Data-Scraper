    "postText": "Hi! I am curious as to what it is REALLY like to be a bio major at Amherst College. Does anyone regret it or are they thriving? \n\n**How hard is it to earn the A? Is there grade deflation?** \n\nI am applying to Amherst and **it is my dream to attend**. However, I am quite worried that I might not thrive and wish to have gone to another school once I am there. Thank you for hearing my thoughts.",

            "comment": "The difficulty is all over the place. It will depend on what classes you take and with what professors. If you game it, I could see you getting through with minimal effort. However, if you pick classes like an actual human being, that is to say, you take what interests you, expect to have to work for some of your As. Amherst seems to give professors a lot of room to run their classes as they see fit. \n\nIf you are worried about not being able to thrive, know that Amherst's goal is not to brutalize their students in an academic gauntlet. Generally, Amherst does not seem to think that higher difficulty and standards make for a better education.",

What I'll say is that if you did your work and didn't slack that much (there's certainly room for slacking), you can definitely get A's. Also, the college is certainly challenging, but it's not THAT hard. Most students here are typically happy, so I'd say just shoot your shot and apply; you won't regret it",

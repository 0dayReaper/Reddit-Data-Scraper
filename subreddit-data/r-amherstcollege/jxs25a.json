Amherst responds but doesn\u2019t always respond sufficiently or swiftly, which is unfortunate. However, I do believe because of our small school, we as a community have a bigger impact and easier access to administration which we have made sure to use in implementing various policies to make campus more safer since 2012 when this article was released. But like you, I\u2019m disgusted this happens at our school and I\u2019m disgusted it happens in general.",

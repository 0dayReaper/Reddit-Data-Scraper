And suicides aren\u2019t exactly common, I think there\u2019s been 2 in the last decade. \nA big issue here is depression, a large portion of the student body is pretty seriously depressed and the counseling center tends to get overwhelmed. The school has been trying to curve the issue for the last few years but it\u2019s not an easy feat.",

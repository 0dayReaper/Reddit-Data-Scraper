    "postText": "According to [source](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/economics/newstudentsinfo), \n\n&gt;Students who display sufficient knowledge of elementary economics may have the option of passing out of Economics 111/111E if they wish.  We generally recommend that students pursuing this strategy start with a 200-level economics elective.  Students have several options for exhibiting sufficient proficiency in elementary economics: 1. Proficiency Examination in Economics: pass the exam given by the department. \n\nI'm an incoming freshman planning on taking the proficiency exam... while I understand that it's an awful idea to study intensively or stress myself out over the placement test, it probably is also a bad idea to go into the test *completely* cold.\n\nDoes anybody here know what is covered on the placement exam so that I can review a bit? \nAnd is it possible to place into ECON 300 or 301 in my first semester?\n\nThanks.",

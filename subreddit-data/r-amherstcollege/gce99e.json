Strongly considering Amherst for ED but I\u2019m concerned about living in a rural area - not a huge hiker, and I like to go out (though not a huge partier, mainly just strolling aimlessly down the street lol). Do you often go to Boston?",

            "comment": "I would say going to Boston is doable, but I would say most people didn\u2019t go frequently. Without a car or a place to crash, traveling to Boston can be expensive. When I attended they also had a rule that you could not have a car as a freshman.\n\nAs someone who grew up in a large city, I didn\u2019t particularly mind the lack of city-ness mostly because I wanted to experience something different. It allowed me to focus on building friendships as we hung out together in town, Northampton, hikes or even the impromptu trip to Boston. \n\nThat being said, I will say not everyone is suited for it. It worked out for me and I loved experiencing a more serene life. But of course, I\u2019m not you. If you\u2019re that unsure about committing yourself to the school due to that, I would hold off of applying ED and apply regular. When the time comes to pick a school, you\u2019ll (hopefully) have the opportunity to visit amherst in person and get a sense of what it\u2019s like.",

It\u2019s a bit of a trek (about 3-4h bus ride), so I wouldn\u2019t want to do it too often, but it\u2019s definitely possible.\n\nI also used to live in a city, although I was excited about the rural stuff. Not liking hikes will not hurt you in any way. There are good trails in Amherst, but I\u2019ve been hiking like twice and been fine.\n\nThe main problem you might have is most of your life will be on campus, because that\u2019s where most things happen. You can get a free bus to the other campuses too, and to places like Walmart, but there\u2019s definitely less non-campus activities within walking distance. \n\nDo you have any particular questions about the switch from a city to rural?\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re still unsure, just apply RD and you can think about it a bit longer :)\n\nGood luck!",

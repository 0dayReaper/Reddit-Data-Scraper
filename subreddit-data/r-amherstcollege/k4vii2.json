    "postText": "hi! i\u2019m a high school senior and i have a few questions about amherst:\n\n1) i\u2019m interested in public health (not necessarily premed) and i have plans to pursue public health after college too, but there sadly doesn\u2019t seem to be a public health major. anthropology seems like a pretty good fit for what i like, but i\u2019m wondering if there are any students who\u2019ve designed their own major in public health, health policy, etc.? \n\n2) most of my ecs revolve around campus/local/state community organizing and it\u2019s definitely something i want to continue doing in college! how is the campus organizing scene at amherst? is there a strong presence of college activists/organizers?\n\n3) i\u2019m a little concerned that because amherst is somewhat isolated, it\u2019ll be a bit harder to find ways to engage with the community, find volunteer/internship/shadowing opportunities, etc.- especially since i\u2019d love to organize in the surrounding community. does it sometimes feel like amherst is a bubble? is it hard to find these sorts of opportunities?",

            "comment": "1. You can design your own major, I think it's an interdisciplinary major. You can also major in whatever you want because any major will be fine. Also, there's [this](https://www.fivecolleges.edu/chs) that is like a public health certification. I think that's the beauty of liberal arts is because no matter your undergraduate major, you will learn critical thinking skills and life skills for any career field. Also, I would recommend no matter where you end up to never fixate too heavily on one topic unless you're super passionate about anthropology. At Amherst, we encourage people to take a bunch of different classes (open curriculum). Similar to you, I'm passionate about Public health and so I came in here wanting to be a humanities major (LJST/Environmental Studies) but I took a statistics class and I really enjoyed it. I'm still interested in Public Health but now I want to help people through epidemiology or biostatistics. Public health is a very large field and there's many ways to make an impact!\n2. Yes, check out this [picture](https://twitter.com/cgm616/status/1179425213001474048/photo/2) of my friend who hosted an environmental awareness campaign. Check out Amherst Uprising in 2015, check out our new racial diversity and inclusion committee created earlier this year to address issues of racism at our school. My fellow peers are some of the most passionate and driven people who organize and actively participate in making our school and our community a better place. \n3. I think Amherst does really feel like a bubble sometimes and it's really up to you to get out of it. Its hard because the the closest school is Umass and that 's still a 10 minute bus ride away and the others are like 30-40min. There's lots of way to get involved in the town of Amherst, but I think it's really up to you to find those pockets of opportunities. Even though we are \"isolated\", we have several opportunities for volunteering, interning, shadowing. You can read to kids, interact with the elderly, (nursing homes nearby) and sometimes they come to Amherst to give sage advice. There's also a billion churches as well which are all places that have their own volunteering opportunities.  I'll just spout some stuff I remember in terms of volunteering and whatnot: My friend did a Habitat for Humanity once, some Environmental clubs do like River clean up days, there's a public health group that raises money for people in other countries, there's a club that helps people with disabilities / autism. So many more, but really it's because people are passionate about these things, so if you find yourself really passionate about a certain thing, Amherst can give you the resources to start a club or host an event. Also, you don't need to apply for clubs like at other bigger schools so you can join whatever club you want, people are pretty inclusive for the most part.",

            "comment": "1. You might want to consider concentrating on econ, biology and poli-sci/LJST since public health is as much about policy and implementation as sociology/anthro. My sister just finished a public health masters and was dual english/bio for undergrad (not Amherst but similar liberal arts school). Perhaps look into graduate programs that look interesting to you and work backwards from their requirements.\n2. (and 3) I can't really compare to other schools, but Amherst had a surprisingly active community scene when I was there fifteen years ago. We did a lot of work in Holyoke and Springfield, which aren't too far away geographically, but are worlds apart demographically.",

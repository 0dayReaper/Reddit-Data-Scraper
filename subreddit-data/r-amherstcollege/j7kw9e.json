It says visual arts portfolios says you need one from someone who is familiar with your work or is that just for prospective art majors? I\u2019m applying for a STEM major btw.",

            "comment": "I was in the same boat when applying. STEM major, art portfolio. Amherst did require a letter of recommendation from my art teacher when I applied (last year) but things may change because of COVID. Always good to double check. If you're applying to multiple colleges where you can submit an art portfolio, you can just reuse the art teacher's recommendation letter.",

Amherst is a liberal arts school with no core curriculum and it is quite common to see double-majors or the \u201cbut I\u2019m pre-meds\u201d. If you have a nice art portfolio, it will only strengthen your application. I am an alumni and I was a Biology major, but I usually put two non-science classes in my schedule each semester. You could wind up both or none of the above. It was some of the fun flexibility at Amherst.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI was just recently accepted off of the Waitlist via phone call. (Like 2 hours ago recently) I was just wondering if any of you were accepted off the waitlist or if you know what that timeline looks like. He told me over the phone that I have one week to decide and that I will receive my letter of admission soon, but I was just wondering if any of you have a more specific timeframe that you can offer me. Thanks!",

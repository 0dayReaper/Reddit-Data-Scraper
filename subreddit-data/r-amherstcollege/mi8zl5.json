    "postText": "Hi amherst peeps! I just got accepted c/o 2025, and I have a couple questions to see if i'd really like it there! I live like 14 hours away from amherst, which is scary, so I want to make sure ill really be happy. \n\nFirst, I've heard a bit about a social divide between athletes and non-athletes since there's such a large varsity athlete population. I'm not a greek life person, haha, so I don't know how a strong athletic culture would compare to that type of environment, if that makes sense. I like want to meet all kinds of people though, and what's really appealing to me is amhersts diversity!! Would you say there's a more competitive or collaborative social environment? Please be super honest. \n\nAnother thing that I'm not sure about is location. Is there a good amount of social stuff to get involved in, both at the college and in the city of amherst? I know nowhere will be perfect, but the campus from what I've seen was not at all what I expected from a 200-year-old school. Are any of the original buildings still there? \n\nWhat are the alumni prospects like? I know amherst people generally go on to do awesome things, but is there a good advising system in place? Are there people who help you find what your strengths are and how you can do awesome things with those strengths? (because after all, what more could you ask of the perfect college, lol)\n\nAll in all, I just really want someone to sell amherst to me. If you really love it or really hate it for whatever reasons, please give me your whole schpiel. Most of the opinions online are from in-state folks, and I cannot relate to that at all. Is it out of your comfort zone? Is it worth it?",

            "comment": "You can read through my old posts because I answer variations of this answer a lot but I'll answer it again tailoring to your specific questions.\n\nFirst of all **congrats** on getting into Amherst and whatever you choose, you will be **fine**. I'm not a tour guide or whatever so I won't give you a bullshit answer, but I'll try to answer as honest as possible with my experiences (currently a Junior).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;First, I've heard a bit about a social divide between athletes and non-athletes since there's such a large varsity athlete population. I'm not a greek life person, haha, so I don't know how a strong athletic culture would compare to that type of environment, if that makes sense. I like want to meet all kinds of people though, and what's really appealing to me is amhersts diversity!! Would you say there's a more competitive or collaborative social environment? Please be super honest.\n\nThere's a lot of athletes. A lot of white athletes. But there's also a lot of POC and FLI athletes. There's athletes who signed, there's athletes who do crew, there's club athletes. Being an athlete is just one part of their identity. Amherst is extremely diverse, you will find lots of interesting people I **promise** you. And it's more collaborative. There's no weed out classes or applying to your major so people aren't cutthroat at other institutions. My friend at UW couldn't get into the CS department so he transferred to WWU. You won't find that here. The faculty and staff are **extremely accessible.** My friend's professor reached out to her personally to check in on here because she was \"quiet on zoom\". I go to office hours to just shoot the shit with professors sometimes. Everyone wants to help everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Another thing that I'm not sure about is location. Is there a good amount of social stuff to get involved in, both at the college and in the city of amherst? I know nowhere will be perfect, but the campus from what I've seen was not at all what I expected from a 200-year-old school. Are any of the original buildings still there?\n\nI think there's enough things going on, plus Northampton and UMASS are nearby. Noho is really cute, so is Holyoke and so Amherst. It like cuteness/quaintness overload. Very aesthetic. I don't know about buildings per say but is that a deal breaker? We do have a new science center which is really cool. My friends and I agree that the style of Amherst is all over the place. Sort of unsightly but also it has it's own quirk I suppose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What are the alumni prospects like? I know amherst people generally go on to do awesome things, but is there a good advising system in place? Are there people who help you find what your strengths are and how you can do awesome things with those strengths? (because after all, what more could you ask of the perfect college, lol)\n\nLast summer I had an REU lined up but it got cancelled and Amherst reached out to it's alumni and asked if they could find internships for us and I was able to link up with an Alum who did nonprofit work. My friend asked the CEO of Steve Madden for an internship and he was like okay. I don't think this is unique to Amherst though, any college will have great alumni ties but our alumni donation rate is actually kind of high, which might indicate we keep a good relationship with our Alum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;All in all, I just really want someone to sell amherst to me. If you really love it or really hate it for whatever reasons, please give me your whole schpiel. Most of the opinions online are from in-state folks, and I cannot relate to that at all. Is it out of your comfort zone? Is it worth it?\n\n**Amherst** **is not special**. You will find these comments at any similar colleges (Williams /Bowdoin whatever) I'm from Washington state and I decided on Amherst because it was the best liberal arts school I got into and my junior year AP english teacher bashed on liberal arts schools so I wanted to experience it. I enjoyed smaller communities with less competitive environments and so I chose the top rank LAC I got into. I was also looking at Bates because their cereal bar is probably the coolest thing ever. And when I toured Bates (never toured Amherst before I got here), I really enjoyed the LAC feel so then I just went on US News Weekly and chose Amherst.\n\n**With that being said**, once I got to Amherst and I personally experienced the small community, the caring professors, the immense resources, the free sparking water and chips at every event, the beauty of rural Massachusetts, meeting passionate and brilliant people, that is when I fell in love with Amherst. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best advice I can give you if you're choosing between LAC is to just go off location and ranking. They're all in bumfuck no where so pick your poison.\n\nIf you're deciding big uni or LAC, go off of size and allocation of resources. You will get more per student spending at tinier private institutions. But I'm also a big fan of medium sized schools, they seem great.\n\nBut honestly, go off of the **vibes**. \n\nGoodluck in deciding and remember your worth is not tied to whatever goddamn institution you choose, but also it feels great to say I go to a top tier mini ivy that is Amherst.",

I was just waitlisted (sad day) but I will just say that I knew that it is where I want to go because after I heard the name and looked at the website, I felt so drawn to it. I just knew it in my gut. Go with what feels right. If there\u2019s another school that feels more right, go with that. If Amherst feels right, go with it. For comparison, what are your other options? Maybe compare the opportunities, location, and alumni network between the schools and go with whichever had the most pros. And congrats on getting in!",

I live 17  hours away and I can say I am really glad I chose Amherst. The location is quiet, but there\u2019s enough stores and other colleges nearby that you won\u2019t get bored, and it\u2019s not overwhelming like a big city might be. The bus route is great for getting around, and having the other schools breaks up that athlete culture a bit. Financial aid just can\u2019t be beat, and the health insurance is great too. The best part of Amherst though is that the professors genuinely care and you can use them to build your own experience Im a rising senior and this year my whole friend group all took at least 1 independent study with their favorite professor to dive deeper into something Amherst doesn\u2019t offer",

    "postText": "Hello HS Senior here,\n\nI was kind of confused what the requirement is for the option B essay. It says that it should be a graded academic paper that shows analytical thinking. I have an essay that was shortlisted by the john locke essay competition and wondered if I could submit that paper even though it wasn't necessarily an essay I wrote in class but it was \"academic\".\n\nDoes anyone have an answer to if It qualifies?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Amherst is a chill, flexible place when you get in, and Admissions and Fin Aid are very helpful.\n\nJust email your regional rep and ask the question. If you have a marked-up analog copy, you can scan it. Ask what they would prefer. They want kids who can write, but if you can\u2019t when you arrive, you for damn sure will by the time you leave. Really true of all LACs, and it\u2019s a marketable skill.\n\nGood luck this season, and relax.",

    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m a recent admit, and with the deadline for choosing schools coming up I\u2019m trying to settle on a school. I\u2019m mostly set on Amherst, but I\u2019m still up in the air on their Computer Science major. I love Amherst\u2019s open curriculum, campus, social scene, all of it. But their Computer Science program seems a little bit lacking at surface level. I know you can take classes at Umass Amherst, but it looks a little complicated(please correct me if it\u2019s not true!) and I also want to make sure I have job security after college. I really want to go into game development as a programmer, and I do want to make sure I can get internships during the summer to beef up my resume, as well as have help from the career center to get a job after I graduate. Amherst is definitely liberal artsy and I love everything about it, but I don\u2019t want to be struggling when I graduate. Any insight would be super helpful!",

            "comment": "it dont matter where u go to school, personal projects / experience is crucial. amherst can probably help you get your foot halfway through the door with name and connections alone but SWE as a field depends on the person and less so networking imo. My friends all applied to hella places and participated in many hackathons, its all a crapshoot.\n\nI was a CS major for two years then dropped and switched to Math because CS feels like a stupid degree. I can google this shit and learn all online for free. I can better help you out if you have specific questions but I promise you you will be fine here if you decide to stick with CS. People here get positions at FAANG and other top companies all the time. You won't really need the career center for CS, maybe to get exposure to different fields but if you're deadset on what you want to do, do personal projects, put everything you can on your github, buy a light up keyboard, maybe one of those adjustable desks and you'll be fine I promise.",

From what I could tell there weren\u2019t a ton of them, and they seemed to only cover basic stuff. You said you switched majors, but from your time in the major how did you feel about it?",

Yeah, it covers the essentials like data structures/algorithms/systems/ML/Security but not much more. You can definitely find the course catalog online.\n\nI thought CS was cool until the pandemic hit and I had to teach myself the material because online learning sucks then I realized I enjoyed coding as a hobby and I couldn't see myself hunched over staring at a screen as a career. From my peers experience, it seems like they are also ambivalent to the CS department here. It's not bad, it's not great. If you're independent and motivated, you will be fine in terms of internships and research opportunities here. \n\nIf CS is something you really want to do and you want to make sure you squeeze everything out of undergrad, maybe go to another school with a better CS program. But if you want to do CS while taking a variety of courses from every department and experience what it is like to go to a LAC, then Amherst will do you just fine. \n\nTangent: I don't think my CS friends are super passionate about their major such that they want to take more classes than necessary. They'd rather take a class from the American Studies department or the Sexual, Women and Gender's studies department, or dabble in learning a new language or learning music theory. It seems like they're all in it for the bag so they're fine with the amount of courses offered at Amherst while being able to explore their own interests at the same time. \n\nI'd advise not being too stuck on one thing at your age if you choose to go to Amherst. Amherst opens you up to so many new things and so many new possibilities. I came here wanting to be an environmental lawyer but I took STEM classes and I realized I liked interacting with people through science/math. So if you decide to come here, have CS as your tentative major but you have the freedom to take many courses and who knows, maybe you wind up enjoying that one random class you had on the structural poverty of immigrants and now you want to major in polisci and become a social worker. Amherst does that you and me and everyone else I know and that's what makes Amherst really neat imo",

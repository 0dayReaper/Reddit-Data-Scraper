Mango spinach smoothies in the morning, the large selection of fruits, incredible desserts (val, please bring back the red bean rice cakes), stir fry station, burger section with the occasional turkey burger &amp; cod cakes, etc.\n\nAnyways, my favorite meal is probably either the burgers w/ fried eggs or chicken tikka masala. Both are just so solid.",

Dunno why, but the vegan ones are better than the standard ones. Gotta get one of the waxy papers from the panini press to hold the bars, though, since they're so sticky \n\nI also like pretty much all the fish options.\n\nAnd the pesto is really good -- I put it on a lot of different things.",

My favorite desserts are the Vegan Ranger Cookies and Butterscotch Blondies. I also enjoy the Grab N Go sushi since even though it's not amazing, it still satisfies my sushi craving.",

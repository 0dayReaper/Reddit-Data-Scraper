    "postText": "Hi! I just had a couple of questions I was hoping current students could answer. \n\n1. At the end of the year when you move out of your dorms, where do you put your belongings? \n2. What are the most common methods of transportation from Bradley Airport to campus? \n3. What were your favorite first year seminars? There's so many options that I can't decide \n4. For those who did the summer bridge program, were the laptops new? How was the overall experience and faculty in general during the program?\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to answer them!",

On campus storage (limited if available), a service called boomerang storage (expensive but convenient, they have given out fee waivers for low income students for a few boxes), or getting a storage unit with a group of people. \n2. Uber is the primary way. There\u2019s also shuttle services you can book in advance and pay for. If you really want to save money, there\u2019s several public transit options that\u2019ll get you to campus but take a few hours.",

            "comment": "1. What everyone else said\n2. Uber/Pioneer Valley Shuttle/Get a zipcar and have a friend take you\n3. You take one FYS so I don't think anyone has a favorite. I took an LJST one with Douglass that I found interesting, not my favorite class but make sure to read the course description and perhaps as faculty for the syllabus if you are curious.\n4. I did summer bridge and I have no recollection of getting laptops, is that a new thing? Summer bridge was one of my favorite moments at Amherst, just being able to experience college without the pressures of college really helped me transition and its so much easier to make friends.",

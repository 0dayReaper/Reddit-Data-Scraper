    "postText": "    by John Lord, LL.D. \n\n        AFTER Moses, and until David arose, it would be  \n         difficult to select any man who rendered greater   \n         services to the Israelitish nation than Samuel.  He  \n         does not stand out in history as a man of dazzling in-  \n         telligence qualities; but during a long life he efficiently  \n         labored to give the nation political unity and power,  \n         and to reclaim it from idolatries.  He was both a po-  \n         litical and moral reformer, \u2014 an organizer of new  \n         forces, a man of great executive ability, a judge and a  \n         prophet.  He made no mistakes, and committed no  \n         crimes.  In view of his wisdom and sanctity it is  \n         evident that he would have adorned the office of high-  \n         priest; but as he did not belong to the family of   \n         Aaron, this great dignity could not be conferred on  \n         him.  His character was reproachless.  He was, in-  \n         deed one of the best men that ever lived, universally  \n         revered while living, and equally mourned when he  \n         died.  He ruled the nation in a great crisis, and his  \n         influence was irresistible, because favored alike by   \n         God and man.   \n            Samuel lived in one of the most tumultuous and  \n         unsettled periods of Jewish history, when the nation  \n         was in a transition state from anarchy to law, from  \n         political slavery to national independence.  When he  \n         appeared, there was no settled government; the sur-  \n         rounding nations were still unconquered, and had  \n         reduced the Israelites to humiliating dependence.  \n         Deliverers had arisen occasionally from the time of  \n         Joshua, \u2014 like Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson, \u2014 but  \n         their victories were not decisive or permanent.  Midi-  \n         anites, Amorites, and Philistines successively oppressed  \n         Israel, from generation to generation; they even suc-  \n         ceeded in taking away their weapons of war.  Resist-  \n         ance to this tyranny was apparently hopeless, and the  \n         nation would have sunk into despair but for occa-  \n         sional providential aid.  The sacred ark was for a time  \n         in the hands of enemies, and Shiloh, the religious  \n         capital, \u2014 abode of the tabernacle and the ark, \u2014 had  \n         been burned.  Every smith's forge where a sword or  \n         a spear-head could be rudely made was shut up, and  \n         the people were forced to go to the forges of their op-   \n         pressors to get even their ploughshares sharpened.  \n            On the death of Joshua (about 1350 B.C.), who had  \n         succeeded Moses and led Israelites into Canaan,  \n         nearly the whole of the sea-coast, all the strongholds  \n         in the rich plain of Esdraelon, and in the heart of the  \n         country, the invincible fortress of Jebus [later site of  \n         Jerusalem], were still in the hands of the unbelievers.\"  \n         The conquest therefore was yet imperfect, like that of  \n         the Christianized Saxons in the time of Alfred over  \n         the pagan Danes in England.  The times were full of  \n         peril and fear.  They developed the military energies  \n         of the Israelites, but bred license, robbery, and crime, \u2014   \n         a wild spirit of personal independence unfavorable to  \n         law and order.  In those day \"every man did that  \n         which was right in his own eyes.\"  It was a period of  \n         utter disorder, anarchy, and lawlessness, like the con-  \n         dition of Germany and Italy in the Middle Ages.  The  \n         persons who bore rule permanently were the princes  \n         or heads of the several tribes, the judges, and the high-  \n         priest; and in that primitive state of society these dig-  \n         nitaries rode on asses, and lived in tents.  The virtues   \n         of the people were rough, and their habits warlike.  \n         Their great men were fighters.  Samson was a sort of  \n         Hercules, and Jephthah an Idomeneus, \u2014 a lawless  \n         freebooter.  The house of Micah was like a feudal  \n         castle; the Benjamite war was like the strife of High-  \n         land clans.  Jael was a Hebrew Boadicea; Gideon, at  \n         the head of his three hundred men, might have been  \n         a hero of medi\u00e6val romance.  \n            The saddest thing among these social and politi-  \n         cal evils was a great decline of religious life.  The   \n         priesthood was disgraced by the prevailing vices of the  \n         times.  The Mosaic rites may have been technically  \n         observed, but the officiating priests were sensual and  \n         worldly, while gross darkness covered the land.  The  \n         high-priests exercised but a feeble influence; and even  \n         Eli could not, or did not, restrain the glaring immorali-  \n         ties of his own sons.  In those evil days there were no  \n         visions from the prophets.  Never did a nation have  \n         greater need of a deliverer.   \n            It was then that Samuel arose, and he first appears  \n         as a pious boy, consecrated to priestly duties by a  \n         remarkable mother.  His childhood was passed in the  \n         sacred tent of Shiloh, as an attendant, or servant of   \n         the aged high-priest, or what would be called by the  \n         Catholic Church an acolyte.  He belonged to the great  \n         tribe of Ephraim, being son of Elkanah, of whom  \n         nothing is worthy of notice except that he was a po-  \n         lygamist.  His mother Hannah (or Anna), however,  \n         was a Hebrew Saint Theresa, almost a Nazarite in her  \n         asceticism and a prophetess in her gifts; her song of  \n         thanksgiving on the birth of Samuel, for a special  \n         answer to her prayer, is one of the most beautiful  \n         remains of Hebrew poetry.  From his infancy Samuel  \n         was especially dedicated to the service of God.  He  \n         was not a priest, since he did not belong to the  \n         priestly caste; but the Lord was with him, and raised   \n         him up to be more than a priest, \u2014 even a prophet and a  \n         judge.  When a mere child, it was he who declared to  \n         Eli the ruin of his house, since he had not restrained  \n         the wickedness and cruelty of his sons.  From that  \n         time the prophetic character of Samuel was established,  \n         and his influence constantly increased until he became  \n         the foremost man of his nation, second to no one in  \n         power and dignity since the time of Moses.   \n            But there is not much recorded of him until twenty  \n         years after the death of Eli, who lived to be ninety.  \n         It was during this period that the Philistines had  \n         carried away the sacred ark from Shiloh, and had  \n         overrun the country and oppressed the Hebrews, who  \n         it seems had fallen into idolatry, worshipping Ashta-  \n         roth and other strange gods.  It was Samuel, already  \n         recognized as a great prophet and judge, who aroused  \n         the nation from its idolatry and delivered it from the  \n         hand of the Philistines at Mizpeh, where a great battle  \n         was fought, so that these terrible foes were subdued,  \n         and came no more into the borders of Israel during the  \n         days of Samuel; and all the cities they had taken, from  \n         Ekron unto Gath, were restored.  The subjection of  \n         the Philistines was followed by the undisputed rule of  \n         Samuel, under the name of Judge, during his life, even  \n         after the consecration of Saul.  \n            The Israelitish Judge seems to have been a sort of  \n         dictator, called to power by the will of the people in    \n         times of great emergency and peril, as among the  \n         Romans.  \"The Theocracy,\" says Ewald, \"by pronoun-  \n         cing any human ruler unnecessary as a permanent ele-  \n         ment of the State, lapsed into anarchy and weakness.  \n         When a nation is without a government strong enough  \n         to repress lawlessness within and to protect from foes  \n         without, the whole people very soon divides once more  \n         into the two ranks of master and servant.  In Debo-  \n         rah's songs all Israel, so far as lay in her circle of   \n         vision, was divided into princes and people.  Hence  \n         the nation consisted of innumerable self-constituted   \n         and self-sustained kingdoms, formed whenever some   \n         chieftain elevated himself whom individuals or the body   \n         of citizens in a town were willing to serve.  Gaal, son  \n         of Zobah, entered Shechem with troops raised by him-  \n         self, just like a condottiere in Italy in the Middle Ages.  \n         As it became evident that the nation could not per-   \n         manently dispense with an earthly government, it was  \n         forced to rally round some powerful leader; and as the  \n         Theocracy was still acknowledged by the best of the  \n         nation, these leaders, who owed their power to circum-   \n         stances, could not easily be transformed into regular  \n         kings, but to exceptional dictators the State offered no  \n         strong resistance.\"   \n            And yet these rulers arose not solely by force of  \n         individual prowess, but were expressly raised up by  \n         God as deliverers of the nation in times of peculiar    \n         peril.  And further, the spirit of Jehovah came upon  \n         them, as it did upon Deborah the prophetess, and as it  \n         did still more remarkably upon Moses himself.   \n            The last and greatest of these extemporized lead-  \n         ers called Judges, was Samuel.  In him the people  \n         learned to put their trust; and the national assembly  \n         which he summoned was completely guided by him.   \n         No one of the Judges, it would seem, had his seat of  \n         government in any central city, but where he hap-  \n         pened to live.  So the residence of Samuel was at  \n         his native town of Ramah, where he married.  It  \n         would seem that he travelled from city to city to ad-  \n         minister justice, like the judges of England on their  \n         circuits; but, unlike them, on his own supreme au-  \n         thority, \u2014 not with power delegated by a king, but  \n         acknowledging no superior except God himself, from  \n         whom he received his commission.  We know not  \n         at what time and whom he married; but his two sons,  \n         who in his old age shared power with him, did not dis-  \n         charge their delegated functions more honorably than  \n         the sons of Eli, who had been a disgrace to their office,  \n         to their father, and to the nation.  One of the great-    \n         est mysteries of human life is the seeming inability of  \n         pious fathers to check the vices of their children, who  \n         often go astray under an apparently irresistible impulse   \n         or innate depravity, in spite of parental precept and ex-  \n         ample, \u2014 thus seeming to show that neither virtue nor   \n         vice can be surely transmitted, and that every human  \n         being stands on his individual responsibility, with pecu-  \n         liar temptations to combat, and peculiar circumstances  \n         to influence him.  The son of a saint becomes myste-  \n         riously a drunkard or a fraud, and the son of a sen-  \n         sualist becomes an ascetic.  This does not uniformly  \n         occur: in fact, the sons of good men are more likely   \n         to be a honor to their families than the sons of the  \n         wicked; but why are exceptions so common as to be  \n         proverbial?    \n            It was no light work which was imposed on the shoul-  \n         ders of Samuel, \u2014 to establish law and order among  \n         the demoralized tribes of the Jews, and to prepare  \n         them for political independence; and it was a still  \n         greater labor to effect a moral reformation and reintro-  \n         duce the worship of Jehovah.  Both of these objects  \n         he seems to have accomplished; and his success places  \n         him in the list of the great reformers, like Mohammed and  \n         Luther, \u2014 but greater and better than either, since he did  \n         not attempt, like the former, to bring about a good end  \n         by bad means; nor was he stained by personal defects,  \n         like the latter.  \"It was his object to re-enkindle the  \n         national life of the nation, so as to combat successfully  \n         its enemies in the field, which could be attained by  \n         rousing a common religious feeling;\" for he saw that  \n         there could be no true enthusiasm without a sense of  \n         dependence on the God of battles, and that heroism  \n         could be stimulated only by exalted sentiments, both  \n         of patriotism and religion.   \n            But how was Samuel to rekindle a fervent religious  \n         life among the degraded Israelites in such unsettled  \n         times?  Only by rousing the people by his teachings  \n         and his eloquence.  He was a preacher of righteousness,  \n         and in all probability went from city to city and village   \n         to village, \u2014 as Saint Bernard did when he preached a  \n         crusade against the infidels, as John the Baptist did  \n         when he preached repentance, as Whitefield did when  \n         he sought to kindle religious enthusiasm in England.  \n         So he set himself to educate his countrymen in the  \n         great truths which appealed to the inner life, \u2014 to the  \n         heart and conscience.  This he did, first, by rousing  \n         the slumbering spirits of the elders of tribes when they  \n         sought his counsel as a prophet, the like of whom had  \n         not appeared since Moses, so gifted and so earnest; and  \n         secondly, by founding a school for the education of    \n         young men who should go with his instruction wher-  \n         ever he chose to send them, like the early missionaries,  \n         to hamlets and villages which he was unable to visit  \n         in person.  The first \"school of the prophets\" was a  \n         seminary of missionaries, animated by the spirit of a  \n         teacher whom they feared and admired as no prophet  \n         had been revered in the whole history of the nation  \n         since Moses.   \n            Samuel communicated his own burning spirit wher-  \n         ever he went, and the burden of his eloquence was  \n         zeal and loyalty for Jehovah.  Before his time the  \n         prophets had been known as seers; but Samuel  \n         superadded the duties of a religious teacher, \u2014 the  \n         spokesman of the Almighty.  The number of his  \n         disciples, whom he doubtless commissioned as evan-  \n         gelists, must have been very large.  They lived in  \n         communities and ate in common, like the primitive  \n         monks.  They probably resembled the early Domini-  \n         can and Franciscan friars of the Middle Ages, who were  \n         kindled to enthusiasm by such teachers as Thomas  \n         Aquinas and Bonaventura.  Like them they were  \n         ascetic in their habits and dress, wearing sheepskins,   \n         and living on locusts and wild honey, \u2014 on the fruits  \n         which grew spontaneously in the rich valleys of their  \n         well-watered country.  It did not require much learn-  \n         ing to arouse the common people to new duties and a  \n         higher religious life.  The Bible does not inform us as   \n         to the details by which Samuel made his influence felt,  \n         but there can be no doubt that by some means he  \n         kindled a religious life before unknown among his  \n         countrymen.  He infused courage and hope into their  \n         despairing hearts, and laid the foundation of military  \n         enthusiasm by combining with it religious ardor; so  \n         that by the discipline of forty years, \u2014 the same  \n         period employed by Moses in transmuting a horde of  \n         slaves into a national host of warriors; a period long  \n         enough to drop out the corrupted elements and replace   \n         them with the better trained rising generation, \u2013 the  \n         nation was prepared for accomplishing the victories of  \n         Saul and David.  But for Samuel no great captains  \n         would have arisen to lead the scattered and dispirited  \n         hosts of Israel against the Philistines and other ene-  \n         mies.  He was thus a political leader as well as a  \n         religious teacher, combining the offices of judge and  \n         prophet.  Everybody felt that he was directly com-  \n         missioned by God, and his words had the force of in-  \n         spiration.  He reigned with as much power as a king  \n         over all the tribes, though clad in the garments of hu-  \n         mility.  Who in all Israel was greater than he, even  \n         after he had anointed Saul to the kingly office?   \n            The great outward event in the life of Samuel was  \n         the transition of the Israelites from a theocratic to a  \n         monarchical government.  It was a political revolu-  \n         tion, and like all revolutions was fraught with both  \n         good and evil, yet seemingly demanded by the spirit of   \n         the times, \u2014 in one sense an advance in civilization,  \n         in another a retrogression in primeval values.  It  \n         resulted in a great progress in martial arts, culture,  \n         and power, but also in a decline in those simplicities  \n         that favor a religious life, on which the strength of  \n         man is apparently built, \u2014 that is, a state of society  \n         in which man in his ordinary life draws nearest to  \n         his Maker, to his kindred, and his home; to which    \n         luxury and demoralizing pleasures are unknown, a   \n         life free from temptations and intellectual snares, from  \n         political ambition and social unrest, from recognized  \n         injustice and stinging inequalities.  The historian with  \n         his theory of development might call this revolution  \n         the change from national youth to manhood, the emerg-  \n         ing from the dark ages of Hebrew history to a period of  \n         national aggrandizement and growth in civilization, \u2014   \n         one of the necessary changes which must take place  \n         if a nation would become strong, powerful, and culti-  \n         vated.  To the eye of he contemplative, conservative,  \n         and God-fearing Samuel this change of government  \n         seemed full of perils and dangers, for which the nation  \n         was not fully prepared.  He felt it to be a change   \n         which might wean the Israelites from their new sense  \n         of dependence on God, the only hope of nations, and  \n         which might favor another lapse to pagan idolatries  \n         and a decline in household virtues, such as had been  \n         illustrated in the life of Ruth and Boaz, \u2014 and hence  \n         might prove a mere exchange of that rugged life  \n         which elevates the soul, for those gilded glories which  \n         adorn and pamper the mortal body.  He certainly  \n         foresaw and knew that the change in government  \n         would produce tyranny, oppression, and injustice, from  \n         which there could be no escape and for which there  \n         could be no redress, for he told the people in detail  \n         just what they should suffer at the hands of any king  \n         whom they might have; and these were in his eyes  \n         evils which nothing could compensate, \u2014 the loss of  \n         liberty, the extinction of personal independence, and a  \n         probable rebellion against the Supreme Jehovah in the  \n         degrading worship of the gods of idolatrous nations.  \n            When the people, therefore, under the guidance of  \n         so-called \"progressive leaders,\" hankered for a govern-  \n         ment which would make them like other nations, and  \n         demanded a king, the prophet was greatly moved and  \n         sore displeased; and this displeasure was heightened   \n         by a bitter humiliation when the elders reproached him  \n         because of the misgovernment of his own sons.  He  \n         could not at first say a word, in view of a demand  \n         apparently justified by the conduct of the existing  \n         rulers.  There was a just cause of complaint.  If his  \n         own sons would take bribes in rendering judgement,  \n         who could be trusted?  Civilization would say that  \n         there was needed a stronger arm to punish crime and  \n         enforce the laws.  \n            So Samuel, perplexed and disheartened, fearing that  \n         the political changes would be evil rather than good,  \n         and yet feeling unable to combat the popular voice,  \n         sought wisdom in prayer.  \"And the Lord said,  \n         hearken unto the voice if the people in all that they  \n         say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they  \n         have rejected me, that I should reign over them.  Now  \n         therefore hearken unto their voice; howbeit yet pro-   \n         test solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of  \n         the king that shall reign over them.\"  The Almighty  \n         would not take away the free-will of the people; but  \n         Samuel is required to show them the perversity of  \n         their will, and that if they should choose evil the con-  \n         sequences would be on their heads and the heads of  \n         their children, from generation to generation.   \n            Samuel therefore spake unto the people, \u2014 probably  \n         the elders and leading men, for the aristocratic element  \n         of society prevailed, as in the Middle Ages of feudal  \n         Europe, when even royal power was merely nominal,  \n         and barons and bishops ruled, \u2014 and said: \"This  \n         will be the manner of the king that shall reign over   \n         you: He shall take your sons and appoint them for  \n         himself for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and  \n         some shall run before his chariots, and he shall ap-  \n         point captains over thousands and captains over fifties,  \n         and will set them to ear [plough] his ground and reap  \n         his harvest, and to make his instruments of war and  \n         the instruments of his chariots.  And he will take  \n         your daughters to be confectioners [or perfumers] and  \n         cooks and bakers.  And he will take your fields and  \n         your vineyards and your olive-trees, even the best of  \n         them, sand give them to his servants; and he will take  \n         the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give  \n         to his officers and to his servants.  And he will take   \n         your men-servants and your maid-servants, and your  \n         goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to  \n         his work.  And he will take the tenth of your sheep;  \n         and ye shall be his servants.  And ye will cry out in  \n         that day because of your king which ye have chosen  \n         you, and the Lord will not hear you in that day.\"  \n            Nevertheless the people refused to bey the voice of  \n         Samuel; and they said, \"Nay, but we have a king  \n         over us, that we also may be like all the nations; and  \n         that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and  \n         fight our battles.\"  It would thus appear that the mon-  \n         archy which the people sought would necessarily be-  \n         come nearly absolute, limited only by the will of God  \n         as interpreted by priests and prophets, \u2014 for the theo-  \n         cracy was not to be destroyed, but still maintained as  \n         even superior to the royal authority.  The future king  \n         was to be supreme in affairs of state, in the direction  \n         of armies, in the appointment of captains and com-  \n         manders, in the general superintendence of the realm  \n         in worldly matters; but he could not go contrary to  \n         the divine commands as they would be revealed to  \n         hi, without incurring a fearful penalty.  He could  \n         not interfere with the functions of the priesthood  \n         under any pretence whatever; and further, he was  \n         required to rule on principles of equity and immu-  \n         able justice.  He could not repel the divine voice,  \n         whether it spake to his consciousness or was revealed  \n         to him by divinely commissioned prophets, without  \n         the certainty of divine chastisement.  Thus was his  \n         power limited, even by invisible forces superior to his  \n         own; for Jehovah had not withdrawn his special juris-  \n         diction over the chosen people for whom he was pre-  \n         paring a splendid destiny, \u2014 that is, through them,  \n         the redemption of the world.   \n\n_________________\nfrom *Beacon Lights of History*, by John Lord, LL.

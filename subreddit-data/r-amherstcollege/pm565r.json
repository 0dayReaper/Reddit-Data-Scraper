    "postText": "I am applying ED to Amherst. I have been simping over Amherst for 8 months now and its getting incredibly stressful. I just got my SAT scores back and it was a 1490. I am devastated. My GPA is fine (Its around 95% in the curriculum I follow, which translates to a \\~3.8-3.9 on the 4.0 scale. It is unweighted). Should I consider going test-optional? Could this score be a reason why AOs outright reject my application? Without ever looking at ECs etc. All of this ties in to me being international, which is sort of, bad? Please tell me what you think, thank you.",

You're right within the average. I think it's certainly good enough that an admissions person would look at the rest of your application! Good luck out there, you've got this!!",

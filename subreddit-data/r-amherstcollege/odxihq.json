All his classes are super fun and it\u2019s really easy to talk in them. They\u2019re pretty much all discussion based, and he is really good at making you feel comfortable about answering any topic in class. While I didn\u2019t have much experience in Islam before his classes, he makes everything super easy to understand, and doesn\u2019t put any pressure on you to get the material the first time around. He\u2019s also super funny as a lecturer and makes 3 hour classes go by like they\u2019re nothing. Overall 10/10 professor and love the dude",

I had zero chem background before that and he gave me sooo much extra help whenever I asked. And I mean whenever. Like 11 pm on Sunday night he'd hop on zoom and go over my homework with me to make sure I'd get full marks. He's incredible",

    "postText": "My son got into Amherst College and UMass, and we are still deciding. We are full-pay and in-state, so Amherst College would cost 51K more per year, 84K vs. 33K. If the costs were similar I would send my son to Amherst, which is his preference.\n\nHe would major in CS at UMass and probably also at Amherst. He is interested in business and points to many Amherst grads working at consulting firms and investment banks. However, Amherst is much more selective than UMass. Is the school itself making a difference? My son mentioned that Amherst sponsors industry-specific \"treks\".\n\nAmherst does not have a business major. Besides Econ 111, are their typical courses that students who get internships at banks or consulting firms will have taken?",

But yeah if he ultimately wants a job coding for a business company the alumni network at Amherst might pay off for him.\n\nOrrrrr the job market is a disaster in 4 years and he\u2019s not able to get a strong starting salary to pay off a 200k loan.",

            "comment": "I think the CS program is better at UMass due to sheer size and availability of different courses. At Amherst, the CS courses are very core and more breadth than depth imo but thats sort of the nature of taking CS at a LAC. I'm not sure about the pathways in consulting at UMass but Amherst does a fine job at preparing people for consulting / investment banking. I don't know how much the name itself gets you places but Amherst is a well known name within these industries that your son is interested in. A lot of people who do consulting do stuff like economics or math or honestly anything. I have a friend who majored in political science whos working at EY and another who majored in Black studies and is working at JP Morgan. With that being said, you're shelling out 50k extra a year to get you maybe a slightly more prestigious name on your resume so that sums up to an extra 200,000 dollars. I don't know if that's worth it honestly and I feel schools like UMass or universities with actual majors in business or whatever are more tailored to people who have specific careers in mind. Amherst emphasizes a holistic learning experience so they really encourage students to explore their options so it may turn out that after coming here, your son suddenly wants to get a PhD in English, now you're down 200k and your son will live a brutal yet honest life of academia. Overall, I think UMass makes more sense financially and career wise.",

I love Amherst. It is a really good school but if you can't afford it or its a stretch go to UMass.  Yes we have a lot of programs with alumni to help people get into banking and tech. It's a common thing that I hear from students how they go to Wall Street after graduation. As far as I know they recruit any major but I typically see Math,econ, and comp Sci. Amherst does have a lot of resources to help get students internships and do research but 200k is just to much of a gap for me.",

However, the alumni networks and connections is incredibly strong at Amherst. I once looked up an alumn in my field to learn more and they basically promised me they could help me job search once I graduate, I can also thank Amherst for a summer internship that\u2019s extremely competitive for my field (clinical psychology, very hard to find good jobs at undergrad level vs research opportunities, which Amherst also has lots of but I can\u2019t speak for Umass). \n\nAll things considered, it\u2019s a tough choice and depends on your kid. Lots of people waste all of the benefits of Amherst, and I know plenty of Umass kids who will get ahead because of their work ethic and ability to \u201cmake it happen\u201d. Also consider that your child may make a complete 180 change in career path which is ridiculously common here so several of these points may not matter.\n\nBottom line, I can vouch for the connections and job-finding aspect of Amherst (I also hear requirements for med schools are a little more lax for schools like AC), but can\u2019t vouch for how your kid will make use of the resources in a way that justifies the cost. \n\nHappy to talk more here or in private",

If we decide to send him to Amherst we will pay for it from his 529 plan without his taking loans, but if he went to UMass that money could be used for graduate or professional school or even for his children some day (it is allowed to change the beneficiary of a 529 in that manner).",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nHas anyone taken 105 Introduction to Computing and The Arts with prof Malita? Here is the course description: [https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/computer\\_science/courses/2122F?display=curriculum](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/computer_science/courses/2122F?display=curriculum)\n\nIt sounds more interesting to me than the normal intro course with Spector, (sidenote, does anyone have any opinions on him? His ratemyprofessors looks a little TOO perfect) but I don't know if it'll prepare me less for future courses.\n\nThanks!",

Also, what\u2019s the difficulty of the intro course? My highschool compsci classes didn\u2019t really have timed exams, and I\u2019m worried abt coding under pressure. Thank you !",

Did a bit of research with him and he deeply cares about his students/teaching.\n\nYou don't need any math to major in CS at Amherst. That being said, I'd recommend you take some math (probably up to linear algebra w/ apps).\n\nThe intro course is fairly easy if you diligently keep up with the work. There's a lot of guidance if you need it through office hours and TA hours, and the exams should be simple if you understand all the core concepts.",

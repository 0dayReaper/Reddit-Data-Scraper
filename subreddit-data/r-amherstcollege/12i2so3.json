            "comment": "Parties are pretty much open at Amherst, anyone can go irrespective of whether you are an athlete. I saw many non athletes at parties. However, athletes do host a lot of mixers/pregames and so the social scene around parties and exposure to them is easier if you\u2019re an athlete. The quality of the parties is another question though, I was never a fan personally and some of my friends who were more naturally into party culture didn\u2019t like them either. \n\nI knew some people that went to bars but I think most students stay on campus. You can definitely find people who do that if you want to. \n\nAnyway I hope I didn\u2019t quell your excitement. Could go on more about the social scene if you want but it seems you mainly wanted to know about parties.",

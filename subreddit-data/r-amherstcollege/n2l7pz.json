I\u2019ve nothing to compare it to since this is the school I chose, but I found it to be a pretty low-stress major. Not a lot of work, interesting and diverse material, cool projects, chill professors (Alfeld is the coolest). I wish there were more student groups for the major (i dont think the CS club was always a thing, or popular when it was), but my peers were always cool too. You\u2019re in for a good time. \n\nMost classes are Java based so if you have experience with it, you\u2019re in a good spot and might be able to skip 111 or 112. I skipped 111, and 112 was a good starting point for me having taken AP CS in high school.",

And yep, I was thinking I\u2019d just skip straight to 112 since I\u2019ve been programming in mainly C# and Java for like five years. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, was it hard to get a job or anything? I was a little worried since Amherst is a LAC lol",

So that being said, it\u2019s my own fault I don\u2019t have a job right now lol. \n\nThe alumni network is really nice for jobs. You can reach out to graduates and talk to them about opportunities at their companies, and sometimes they\u2019ll refer you to positions. I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about employment after Amherst, there are plenty doing big things with a degree from here.",

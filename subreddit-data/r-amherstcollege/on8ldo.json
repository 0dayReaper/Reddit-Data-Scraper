Everyone loves Amherst (why would we be here if not?) but it\u2019s nice to get away from campus once in a while. So, what do you like to do when you get away for the weekend? Or when you\u2019re really trying to avoid that paper you still need to do?",

            "comment": "We didn\u2019t do this too often, but my favorite \u201cget away\u201d moment was when my friends and I would walk to UMass up the road and wait around outside their main dining hall in the snow and try to convince the students there to spare us a guest swipe into the dining hall. It was good respite for when we grew tired of Val (never the lighter side chicken though) and needed a little change up. Not sure what our success rate was, but we would always manage to get in one way or another. Not sure if this is sacrilege, but the food there is extremely overhyped. More selection than Val definitely, but I was slightly let down by the actual food, most of which had massive lines as well. The nice thing is that their dining hall is open until midnight (I think?) and I went once with a friend whilst inebriated and it made everything that much better. Also, you find someone willing to guest swipe you in much quicker if they are also inebriated into the night. I highly recommend that everyone does this at least once during their stint at Amherst. If anyone needs good lines to get in, hit me up",

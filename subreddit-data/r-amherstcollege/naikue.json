    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm an incoming '25 and was wondering about how finance is treated on campus. I don't really know what i want to do, but I am considering going into consulting.\n\n1. What is the support on campus like for pursuing these jobs. How is the alumni network in finance?\n2. I know that Amherst regularly sends kids off to companies like Bain, but are these jobs competitive to get amongst the student body? Is everyone gunning for the same opportunities? \n3. Are the finance clubs on campus selective? (do you have to interview like at other schools)\n4. Does the econ department prepare you for jobs such as consulting, or is it more theoretical things being taught.\n5. Kind of a dumb question, but when you interview do you fly out to the companies? (this is me worrying about the location of Amherst bc I think its far from recruiting sites).\n\nThank you!",

Support on campus is generally pretty good. We have a career center with a badass finance/consulting advisor (Stephanie). My advice is to seek her out early, as she gets booked up during recruiting season. Alumni network is amazing in that everyone is really happy to talk to and help out current students. I've gotten so many referrals to jobs from excited alums hoping to give students a hand. We have a directory with everyone's emails, so it's easy to contact someone you see in a role you're interested in.\n2. If you're asking about a company quota, I can't really answer this one as it really varies from company to company. Opportunities from Bain, BCG, and McKinsey are pretty tough to get anyways, but I notice that a decent chunk of the junior/senior classes gets internships/jobs from all three every year.\n3. No. All clubs are inclusive by nature. Pre-professional clubs here are much less serious than those at big schools anyways.\n4. Theoretical. Any practical work is going to have to happen in your own time.\n5. Depends. Before COVID we used to have to. But I could see companies adopting a zoom-based interview after this year. I'm a tech guy so I had a few final rounds last semester that would have been on-site (in SF, Madison, Boston, and Seattle), but I was able to do the interviews from my room bc of the pandemic.\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to DM for any q's",

            "comment": "Hi! Alum here with plenty of friends who have been/are in the consulting/finance industry:\n\n1. there is a TON of support for consulting and finance. Not only is there a dedicated career center advisor, these companies actively recruit on campus/give out internships to top tier liberal arts schools because they like the skillsets that liberal arts develops. There are plenty of alums who are always happy to get on the phone with you to chat about their career paths. I would recommend using the directory since alums are probably some of the most responsive I've seen (compared to other schools friends have attended). I will say most of these alums are concentrated in NYC, Boston, and SF so just keep that in mind.\n2. Consider the top consulting and finance companies (Bain, McKinsey, etc) as competative regardless of how many are applying. Yes, there will be a sizable chunk of students seeking these jobs, but that being said usually 2-3 will get a positon at these companies.\n3. Clubs at Amherst are not selective. You just show up to the meetings. There's no applicaiton process of that kind.\n4. Econ is 100% more theoretical. All the majors at Amherst are skewed this way. There are some courses at UMass you can take, but Amherst can be iffy about which courses you take there because they don't want you taking any pre-professional courses. For example, my friend was rejected from taking an accounting class simply because the registrar deemed it too pre-professional.\n5. Depends on the company. During my time at Amherst they would have either on-campus interviews/recruitment sessions or you would be flown out. However, most of these companies are in Boston/NYC which is a managble bus ride/train ride away (Boston is 2 hrs by bus and NYC is 4-5hrs by bus). I had friends who would regularly make day trips to these cities for interviews or would just make a weekend out of it.\n\nThat being said, if consulting/finance is your current career goals, Amherst is a great place to be. A large portion of my class (I would honestly say a solid 1/3) ended up in a consulting/finance job. If you want it, you will find a job.\n\nFeel free to DM me any more questions!",

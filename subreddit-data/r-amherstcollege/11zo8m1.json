These routes ran in a l[imited trial for winter break and spring break](https://www.gazettenet.com/New-bus-service-launches-with-service-from-region-to-Boston-New-York-48840393), and now it is turning into a daily service starting tomorrow.  \n\n\nHer[e is the schedule,](https://www.ourbus.com/routes/boston-ma-to-amherst-ma?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8e-gBhD0ARIsAJiDsaUsrjVDdRqvFr2ymh0KhMTzu_ZPY7RzCImuBbq7E1n08XfSd9ya7OUaAq67EALw_wcB) it leaves from Amherst Common on Pleasant Street. Tickets to Boston start at $20, NYC starts at $25, and they vary based on demand. It will run once a day for the time being, the plan is to add more runs to the schedule in a few months time.  \n\n\nFor the first week of the route (3/24 to 3/30) we are giving away free rides on this route with the code OURBUSPIONEER.",

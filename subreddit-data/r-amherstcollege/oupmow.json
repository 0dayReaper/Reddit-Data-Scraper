Amherst was my top choice since its curriculum allows for the freedom to double major/explore, but I'm not sure how that'd all work out and would love to talk with a student already pursuing a double major here :D",

            "comment": "The neuroscience major has a larger course requirement than other majors, and the department heavily discourages double majoring because of that. I am a biology/psych double major, and I have found it to be very reasonable. I even took a chunk of the neuro stuff and counted it towards my psych or bio requirements. I think most students double major, but I have not heard of any neuro students doing so. I am sure they would let you if you made a big deal about it.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a prospective high school student studying in Pakistan according to the British Educational System i.e. IGCSEs and A-Levels. I was wondering whether me studying at an institution that follows the British system has put me at a disadvantage when applying to Amherst, and if I will find it difficult to adapt to the new educational system?\n\nMoreover, I would love to gain a unique insight into the student body at Amherst. What is the general attitude of the student body towards incoming international students? A generalised review of the student body which although is not an accurate representation of the student body itself would really help me.\n\nAs I am in the final year of A-levels, nearing the application process for Amherst College I would love if you all could take a few moments out of your day to answer my queries.\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "While I can\u2019t speak for the transition from a British education to an American one (I was technically a domestic student), I will say that Amherst (during my time 5 years ago) was very attentive to their international student population. There was a Dean for international students who you can reach out to for issues, a special international student orientation where you\u2019re paired with current international Amherst students to guide you through the transition in the US, and a strong International Student Association Club presence. \n\nAs for student to student relationships, I was (and am) close with my international friends. Granted, it was clear that international students tended to form closer bonds with each other, but a large part of my friends said it was because international students were grouped together early in the orientation process. My friends never really had trouble bonding with domestic students. Maybe there was the occasional reference to American popular culture or history that my friends didn\u2019t get but they also weren\u2019t shy to speak up and let me know they didn\u2019t understand that concept. My friends told me that that was probably the biggest hurdle for befriending domestic students especially when a domestic student relies on American popular culture for driving a conversation.\n\nI hope that answers some questions! From what I remember, Amherst has quite the sizable international student population and the school tries to do its best to cater to students.",

They are welcoming and will do as much as possible to make the experience easier.",

            "comment": "You would face no disadvantage having studied under the British education system. It's fairly well-known/understood to the admissions committee relative to some of the more obscure international qualifications systems. A-Levels are a good preparation for life at Amherst and the transition is quite easy in my opinion - most British students I know do pretty well academically. I found my first two years at Amherst easier than my last year in the British education system.\n\nIn my opinion, the international community at Amherst is a little insular. International orientation is the week prior to domestic orientation, and so people tend to become close friends with their international peers and don't always branch out as much when the domestic students arrive. At the same time, certain groups of domestic students are more welcoming than others  - it sort of depends on your interests, the makeup of your freshman floor + dorm, and what classes you choose. Either way - while I'm not super involved - the international community is pretty great and generally very supportive of each other. The international resource center staff also make a huge, huge effort to aid students in whatever way they can - they're the best.\n\nHope this helps.",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly how Amherst admissions works, but they do take a fair amount of international students, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019ve never seen an A Level or anything. Overall, I would try your best on the exams and you should be fine :)\n\nAs for adapting to a new culture, I know that moving country can definitely cause a bit of culture shock. I moved from the UK a fair bit before college apps, so I can\u2019t speak firsthand about adjusting while at college, but Amherst does have a resource center for international students that\u2019s fairly active. America tends to be less test focused, and as a liberal arts college you may end up taking more different types of classes than you did in A Levels.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen people are pretty accepting to international students. I know a couple who applied internationally, and they all seemed to fit in fairly quickly (although I know time zones are being a pain in the ass for them now)\n\nGood luck on A Levels!!",

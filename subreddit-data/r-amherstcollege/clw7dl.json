    "postText": "Hi! I'm an international applicant looking to apply to Amherst, I had a couple questions I was hoping people could answer. Any info is appreciated!\n\n1. I'd be applying as a Comp Sci major. How good is the university at internships and job placements, also for international students.\n2. Are there a lot of international students and diversity?\n3. I'd be applying for financial aid, but they don't mention how much of it would be loans. Do internationals receive scholarships? What's the max. amount?\n4. Can you work on-campus? Does this make a significant amount of money?\n5. Do IB credits transfer?\n6. Can you graduate a year early?\n7. Anything else you want to tell me about the school?\n\nAlso my stats are\n\nSAT - 1530\n\nIB score - predicted 40 - Math phy chem hl\n\nI'll be taking my subject tests this october in math 2 and physics and hopefully do well",

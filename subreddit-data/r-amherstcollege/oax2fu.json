            "comment": "CVS in town is probably your go to for most small items. Target is up route 9 and so is trader joes / wholefoods / walmart / big Y (the best store). It's not walkable within 5 minutes but a bus ride is like 10-15 min or you can walk which will be about 20-25 min. \n\nThe last time I bought anything at CVS was two years ago and the prices seemed fine. due to shtf, prices might be higher because of shortages / droughts",

Amherst IT also carries a lot of Apple and PC tech accessories that they\u2019ll loan you for the year, so most likely you\u2019ll not have to buy those",

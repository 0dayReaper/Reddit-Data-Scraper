There are (or was before Covid) a few different concert venues, a place to go \u201cclubbing\u201d, some nice restaurants and cafes (woodstar and cafe mosaic are 2 of my favorite places over there and still like they were 10 years ago), unique bars (Tunnel Bar).",

How is the shuttle/transportation system at Amherst, and was their anything in particular you did with friends whenever you went offcampus?\n\n(If you know anything about the earth sciences or geology program there too I would like to learn more about that)",

There\u2019s a bus service that runs between the various schools but it\u2019s a bus and it\u2019s slow especially going back and forth from Northampton and Amherst. The bus to Northampton runs through UMass so if you need to get to Smith it\u2019s a bit of a longer trip than it needs to be.\n\nIf you want to be able to do things off-campus, I\u2019ll point out the Crew team rows from a boathouse on the nearby river and it can be a good way to get away from campus. They are welcoming to new students who have never rowed before.",

If your worry is that your interactions will be too limited, I will say that it hasn't been a problem for myself. This campus is small yes but it is much easier to make closer and more lasting relationships with other students here. I will say that, in regard to your question, that social interactions with others from the consortium are not really that prevalent unless you're a big partygoer, are a part of a 5-college club that regularly meets, or take classes with the other colleges, but those friendships are also somewhat difficult to sustain. So yeah, the vast majority of your social interactions will come from Amherst itself, but isn't a real problem after you make close friends here.\n\n2. As a minority myself, I haven't had any issues with the town/area, nor have I heard of any.",

There are a few bars and places to eat in town but if you're someone that really enjoys the night life of a larger city then there probably is not too much for you. The places to eat in town are generally very good and are a nice treat to have after having dining hall food for too long, and the bars are also fun if you go with friends. There are quite a few nice spots in Northampton that are accessible from the bus, and can make for fun and short trips with friends. Generally, the surrounding area is pretty remote, but it makes for a lot of nice hiking spots if that is your kind of thing. There are also opportunities to get out of campus and in to Boston/NYC with club events or weekend trips with friends. Generally, I think most people think they are going to be going off of campus more than they actually do once the school work and campus activities start setting in. It's a pretty typical small college town in that there is everything that you would expect to find, but in a much more limited capacity. Is there anything in particular that you are looking for?",

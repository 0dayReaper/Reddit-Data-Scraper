            "comment": "Rising senior here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly, congrats on getting into Amherst! There is something for everyone here and I hope that you enjoy it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for some classes:\n\nI really enjoyed Philosophical Questions (PHIL-111) when I took it last fall with Prof. Hasan. It wasn't so much the material that stuck with me (it was still very interesting though!), but rather the deep and out-of-the-box responses from my classmates. Some of their responses just leave me awestruck and appreciative that I go to a school like Amherst. The class also teaches you how to effectively evaluate and craft arguments, which has helped my writing in other areas too. I'd recommend to take that at some point in your Amherst Career. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, Intro Geology (GEO-111)  with Prof. Tekla was just plain awesome. She is a great professor and the material, in my opinion, covers some of the most interesting topics that I have ever learned. The class talks about Earth's processes and basic geology, including earthquakes, volcanism, plate tectonics, how the Earth changes, and more. You also get to go on some field trips around western MA that I thought were very fun. That class alone pushed me to pursue a double major in geology (my first being computer science). Also any class with Dave Jones is a great pick, just because he is one of the nicest and most caring people that I have ever met, on top of being an excellent professor (he's also in the GEO department).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone already mentioned Prof. Couvares in the American Studies dept and I can confirm that he's super cool. He's like a cool grandpa that tells stories and I really enjoyed the one class that I took with him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it's valuable for every student to try Intro Comp Sci (COSC-111) at some point, because programming can help improve work efficiency in pretty much every field.  The class  teaches problem solving and compartmentalizing, which is applicable to anything that you do. I'm likely biased because I am a comp sci major, but these classes are no doubt valuable, regardless of your major. Try and get Prof. Gardner if you can, she's the best in the department for sure.",

My recommendations are likely influenced by both those facts.\n\nAny class with Adam Sitze will improve your ability to analyze and argue--and more importantly, to do so with patience and empathy.\n\nEven if you don't pursue computer science, the introductory courses are a great way to try out programming and understand the mindset.\n\nThe Modern World with Natasha Staller is a terrific survey of art history and she is a quirky, fun professor.  Seriously, she's a hoot.\n\nIndustrial Organization with Jun Ishii has come to define my career the most.  It covers the theory of how companies organize themselves and behave in the marketplace, which is essential stuff if you're interested in business, economics, or (in my case) law.  This was definitely one of the hardest courses, I took, but also one of the most fascinating and useful.",

I didn't plan to major in computer science, but I am *so* glad that I did.  My two majors were a nice break from each other; when I couldn't read or write any more, I would code, and vice versa.  And when it came time to apply for graduate school and jobs, knowledge in two different disciplines made me a better candidate.\n\nI would choose courses based on a combination of both.  Take a sliding scale approach.  Sometimes you need to take a particular course, whether for your major or to find out if you like it, and you should do so unless you hear the professor is terrible (rare at Amherst).  Other times, you may enjoy a professor's teaching so much that it's worth taking another course with her, even if it's completely outside your interest area.  There's no universal formula.  And honestly, you will probably take a bad class or two, but that doesn't matter in the scheme of things.",

In summary, it gave me a terrific foundation that I could build on in my work and education afterwards.\n\nMy professors taught me the substantive skills I rely on every day, mainly reading critically and arguing with both empathy and effectiveness.  That's the hallmark of a liberal arts education.\n\nI also learned the basic principles of various disciplines.  In my case, those were law, computer science, and economics.  Graduates of research universities may come out of their schools with more knowledge in any one of those disciplines.  But I felt pretty comfortable with all of them at a basic level and I've had more than enough time to expand upon my knowledge and interest in each one.\n\nOf course, I had a lot of fun, too.  I performed with a student group, worked a campus job, wrote for campus publications, and went to a lot of parties.  Amherst's small size meant that when I did each of those, I knew at least some people there.  Don't underestimate the role of the open curriculum, either; the fluidity between departments means that you'll make more friends in other disciplines.  Most of my closest friends from Amherst majored in the hard sciences.  It has been *so* much fun to see the variety in what everyone has done afterwards:  law school; medical school; business school; PhDs in ecology, biochemistry, and international relations; and careers in finance, marketing, consulting, and non-profits.\n\nDespite its size, Amherst has resources, too.  I found the pre-law advising office to be quite helpful when I applied to law school.  They helped me with my personal statement and provided detailed feedback and guesses on my application list.  \n\nI felt one disadvantage, but I suspect most college graduates do and you won't face it for a while.  At Amherst, I constantly received feedback:  discussions in office hours, grades on midterms, grades on papers.  I knew where I stood in each course.  When I started my first job, I didn't receive formal feedback as often.  I would frequently scramble to finish an assignment, send it to a supervisor, and *then* fret over whether I could have done better.  Without formal grades, I didn't realize that every piece of work I did reflected on me.  I eventually learned to take pride in my work, to complete it more carefully, and to treat most work I completed as final.  I bet a lot of college graduates had a similar experience, but I wonder if the small, intimate, and high-feedback environment at Amherst made it harder.  To be clear, those are all *great* things--really, Amherst's strengths.  You'll just have to leave them behind at some point!",

My time at Amherst has been the most transformative period of my life and I'm glad I made the last minute decision to enroll at a small liberal arts college in rural Massachusetts on that one fateful day. I hope you experience something similar in your journey.\n\nIn terms of classes, there are a few that come to mind that have changed the way I think and view the world. We are fortunate to have some amazing professors who are genuinely interested in their field and their students. Professor Corrales is a super personable, intelligent, well-accomplished man and his class on political economies of the developing world changed my understanding of what exactly a country needs to experience to go from a third- or second- world nation to a first-world one. His lectures were always engaging and class discussions lively. \n\nProfessor Heim is an amazing professor as well. Eloquent, brilliant, and extremely understanding. She teaches various classes on ancient Indian religions and Buddhism. I never expected to take a religion class, not to mention one about ancient India, but I'm glad I did because I got some invaluable lessons on happiness that I apply to my daily life, even today.\n\nI have a lot more to say but I don't necessarily have the time right now. If you have any questions, reach out to me and I'll happily answer any question you have. Cheers!",

TA hours were also pretty useful, but I never thought anything was impossible if I had to skip them.\n\nLogic and reasoning is discrete. Idk why Amherst doesn\u2019t call it discrete, but even the professors call it discrete. Anyways, I am not a math major, but this class was just interesting. There was a fair amount of class and homework time, but the TA and teacher were very supportive and so it wasn\u2019t too bad. I had Pflueger, and he was definitely a good professor. He\u2019s good at explaining new concepts, and understanding if you ever need extensions or help.\n\nOk now least favorite... I\u2019m going to have to say Intro to Econ. It wasn\u2019t completely awful, and the teachers were lovely, but the class was too lecture heavy for me. It was basically reading, then review what you read in the lecture, then have a short discussion class about more reading. Again, not a complete bust, but I definitely prefer the less completely lecture classes.\n\nAlso yes this subreddit is so dead lol",

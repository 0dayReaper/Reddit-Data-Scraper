    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI have recently been admitted to the class of 2027.  I would like to ask you your opinion on the physics education in Amherst. I have been trying to make a decision and thought it would be the best to ask current students their opinions. I am planning to go to grad school after bachelors if that will make a difference in your comments. Thank you so much for your answers, I am looking forward to become a member of the community next year!",

            "comment": "Hey, congrats on your acceptance! Math/physics junior here. The physics here is great, and if your goal is grad school, you're at the right place! As a small LAC, research opportunities are very accessible, and it's very easy to begin working one on one with a professor as soon as your freshman year. More access to professors helps with letters of recommendation, which are crucial for graduate school. Do keep in mind though our size also means there isn't as wide a selection of research areas as say a big university (ex. there's not a lot of computational stuff and you'd have to go to Dartmouth for engineering).\n\nThe community here is very tight-knit, as there are only around a dozen majors a year. That I think will become a big part of your experience if you attend. The major is not easy, and in all honesty, our professors aren't as stellar as the math department's. But office hours are a big part of every class, and if you make the effort to study with other majors in your year, I think you'll have a great time.\n\nPhysics majors here consistently get great grad school placements, though if you change your mind and decide to go to tech, finance, or grad school in another field, many people have done so and been successful.\n\nIf you're deciding between other LACs, one advantage Amherst has is that it's easy to take grad level courses at UMass. Although imo this is more important in something like math or CS.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. I'd be happy to talk over DMs!",

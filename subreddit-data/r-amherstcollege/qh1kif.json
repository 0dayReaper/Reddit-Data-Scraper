    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm a student at Northeastern (down I-90 in Boston, for those of you unaware of MA geography). I'm currently in my third year, looking to transfer to Amherst, entering in Fall '22.\n\nI toured the campus last week and I simply fell in love with the College and town - I could write a whole essay on this, and if you'd like my specific reasons for transferring and why I love Amherst please do not hesitate to ask - but it's safe to say I'd love to attend this school one day. Northeastern, which is essentially the polar opposite of Amherst, has, for a million different reasons, driven me to wit's end, and I'm eagerly awaiting my exit from this institution and unwilling to give it any more of my money, if possible.\n\nI understand that transferring is nigh on impossible (about a 5% transfer acceptance rate most years) but I'll still give it my best shot. Having said that, I think my qualifications make me quite competitive. I have a 3.9/4 GPA here and I take part in leadership as part of a number of clubs/organizations related to my major, international affairs and economics double major w/minors in history and poly sci, and as a prospective future lawyer, I've done two internships at major law firms and organizations in NYC. I was a decent, not incredible, high school student (3.95/4.5 weighted, 3.55/4 unweighted, 31 ACT and 1380 SAT, good ECs and APs) but seeing as I'm three years removed from high school, I don't know how much more my college grades will be given preference over my HS ones. I shouldn't have any issues getting letters of rec or anything else necessary for the Common App. I'm willing to relinquish a large amount of credit to attend Amherst, as much as is necessary to make me a decent applicant.\n\nBottom line is, if there are any of you 4-year transfers reading this, do you have any advice for me? Am I a competitive applicant? If you have any questions or require any clarification, don't hesitate to DM me or reply to this post. Thank you very much!",

Majority of transfers would go in as juniors or second semester sophomores.\n\nYou are currently in your third year, so you would transfer in as a senior, assuming they took all your credits (which they probably will not). I think for various reasons they would see you as a rising senior and just ignore your application, unfortunately. Even if your transcript dropped a whole year.\n\nReread your post. If your essay is amazing that\u2019s probably your best bet. I live in Cambridge and work at BU so I\u2019m sympathetic, but it\u2019ll be tough. I\u2019d contact the admissions dept and see if you could discuss with them if your are a strong candidate. If you don\u2019t get in, consider UMass for grad school, the area itself is amazing, if that\u2019s the thing you\u2019re looking for. Very different from Boston.",

That's why I'd love to see how much credit I could relinquish to make me a more competitive applicant. Hell, I'd be willing to relinquish enough credit to start as a sophomore (or even more?), that's the extent to which I dislike Northeastern (though they did give me decent financial aid, hence why I can make this decision).\n\nOf course it'll be tough, but as a wise man once said, you won't know if you don't try!",

            "comment": "Sounds like you have a stronger application than I did as a community college transfer. I was just 4.0 with no extracurriculars and nothing else on the side. I did not take any standardized tests, and my high school GPA was 0.9. In addition, I had a 10-year gap on my resume. \n\n I think your only problem will be spinning a narrative for why it makes sense to drop credits to enter as a junior (no way around this). If you put the school you are at down too much, I doubt Amherst will be impressed. All of the non-CC transfers I have met did not have nearly as much done already as it sounds you do. If I was in Amherst admissions, I think your situation would look a little sketchy. It can't hurt to try.",

Having said that, you are right in that it might be difficult to spin my narrative as to why I would be content essentially forgetting a few years of college.\n\nI've got just a few more questions, if you're comfortable/capable of answering them - how many non-CC transfers do you happen to know, and does Amherst have a preference towards CC students in the transfer process to your understanding?",

CC students are definitely heavily favored for transfers. There are 3 students total that I know who are non-CC/international transfers.",

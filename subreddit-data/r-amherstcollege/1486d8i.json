(To clarify, they were doing great academically, e.g. 5 classes with a few grad-level classes as sophomores). I think the oppression wasn't really overt, it comes more from just a generally toxic atmosphere of some selection of very vocal people losing the desire to have civil conversations or understand other people's perspectives, and that just makes a lot of viewpoints socially out-of-bounds, even if some majority of people might be down to discuss or interested to hear",

            "comment": "I think it can feel like a suppression of free speech because Amherst is just one big echo chamber of all things liberal. It can be difficult to go against the grain in an environment like that. \n\n\nThere\u2019s also a rumor (never been associated with the department or the majors so idk) that the poli sci department only has one professor that does not identify as a socialist or even further left. There could be an argument in there somewhere about the suppression of bipartisanship or whatever.",

I imagine it\u2019s like every other campus where students can, if interested, experiment with expression and identity. If you\u2019re asking whether there\u2019s a predominate ideology \u2026 Maybe? I\u2019d bet, if anything, the majority is \u201cconservative New England democrat.\u201d",

The few that think it\u2019s not at all a problem are probably the problem themselves.\n\nI\u2019ve had a couple of class discussions on the topic and every time people get very quiet and uncomfortable. Sometimes one or two kids will very strongly argue that no discomfort exists, but they\u2019ve always been the \u201cSJW\u201d types.\n\nOn the opposite side of things, I\u2019ve had  classmates grumble about how nobody understands Dave Chapelle\u2019s genius or complain about not getting to make highly offensive jokes. The anonymous Reddit-like app for the campus, Fizz, is full of explicit racism and misogyny. Those are likely the people that feel most \u201coppressed.\u201d\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s an issue, but no, it\u2019s not anywhere close to as dramatic as Fox makes it out to be.",

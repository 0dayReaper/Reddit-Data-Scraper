    "postText": "On the 31st March, I took OurBus to visit my parents and it was my first time taking OurBus. Someone commented on my inquiry post regarding the ride with IG link for their ongoing offer. I am not bragging about OurBus but ride was comfortable and I did not have to pay for the one-way ride as they were having 100% discount as their part of launch. \n\nIf you want to travel to NYC from Amherst I would recommend you to travel with them. They have regular services as well. I am still in NYC but I have booked my return journey with them and it only costs $25 from NYC. It is very affordable for people who are traveling on budget.",

I am so happy to be a part of an organization that thinks about students and has services available during Spring Breaks.  \nIf you ever need any info regarding OurBus feel free to contact me but don't jump to any conclusions without knowing any facts.  \nBe kind to people no need to get offended so much.  \n\n\nTake care Bro!",

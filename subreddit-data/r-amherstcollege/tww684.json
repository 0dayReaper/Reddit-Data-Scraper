    "postText": "I received my financial aid letter from Amherst yesterday, and well, they expect my parents to contribute more than half of their yearly salary. \n\nI was really surprised by this, considering that we have a fafsa efc of zero and the net price calculator gave me a net price of about 2k per year. \n\nI booked an appointment with an financial aid officer tomorrow, so I was wondering if there was anyone who also went through this experience and has some guidance on what I should prepare. \n\nThank you!",

Just bring the facts with you and lay out your situation. It is possible something had been filled out incorrectly. \n\nIf you plan on taking out loans anyway ask if there are any options besides private loans from an outside bank.",

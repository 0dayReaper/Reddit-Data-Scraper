    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm currently in the thick of IB exams/IAs etc but have already been accepted to Amherst ED. Right now I'm wondering how much value the diploma/IB exams/IB classes have and if getting a certain grade will allow me to not take courses or get credit. I'd also love to hear some personal experiences/perhaps tips since I'm quite stressed since the whole Ib thing feels quite futile but also very necessary. Thanks!",

For instance, this is the statistics department and they tell you what IB scores you need: [https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics/major-in-statistics/getting-started-in-the-major/placement-information](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics/major-in-statistics/getting-started-in-the-major/placement-information)\n\nI don't have any experience with IB since I did AP but I'm pretty sure for the most part, you can only place out of classes in STEM like Math / Econ / CS / Bio so if you're thinking about going into more humanities, regardless of scores on your English or Humanities portion of the IB, you will need to take the classes.",

            "comment": "Hi! First of all, congratulations on getting accepted to Amherst! I took the IB in high school, so I completely understand how you are probably feeling right now. It is a struggle to get through that second semester of senior year. \n\nI personally found the IB diploma valuable for two reasons. First, if you score a 6 or 7 on certain HL courses, you can place out of one or many intro-level courses. Each department has their own policies so you should check on their respective websites for more information. Generally, this applies more to science/math/CS/econ/foreign language fields as they have intro courses that are pre-requisites to take more advanced courses. On the other hand, humanities/social science fields (Anthropology, Political Science, Sociology, etc.) are structured differently so there aren't really courses \"to place out of\" in those fields. \n\nYou won't get credit for any of the IB courses you take. Amherst requires that all students take 32 courses so while you can place out of courses, you'll still have to take 32 total. \n\nAnother benefit is that I feel like if you try hard in the IB, the transition between high school and college will be pretty smooth. I just finished my first semester here and I think the skills I acquired in the IB (e.g. reading, writing, problem-solving) have been quite useful this semester. \n\nGood luck on your exams in May!",

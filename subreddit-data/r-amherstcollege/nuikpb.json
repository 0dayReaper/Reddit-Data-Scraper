    "postText": "I am really curious to know about the motivation and cheerfulness of Amherst's students.\n\nIt's been one month, but the whole Amherst community seems too dead to me. From be a mammoth sessions to zeemee community, Instagram to WhatsApp groups, discord to Facebook groups, current students, my upcoming freshman batchmates- all seems too silent, introverted and unengaged.\n\nEven none of the clubs have a structured website and the Facebook groups are dead for two years, seems like no club activities are happening at Amherst for 2-3 years. The whole vibe is very depressing. Moreover, the 1000 acre area campus with only 1800 (mostly introverted and gloomy) students, I think I will feel lonely and depressed as hell. So had some inquiries.\n\n1. I know all kinds of people will be at the college, but still is it hard to find a big group of cheerful, engaging, extroverted people who do academics, club activities and fun all together? I surely want good academics and a good job, but I also want to make some fun and nostalgic memories here for my lifetime which I couldn't do during my 12-year school life.\n2. Is there any STEM and tech-focused societies or clubs which do personal projects and participate in different competitions? Or is it possible to find similar-minded motivated students? I will probably major in either cs or physics. In other universities, students of both majors independently collaborate on personal design projects like developing a machine learning framework for detecting drug resistance or creating a software for biomedical robotics, things like that. Are Amherst students engaged in this kind of club and design activities? Can I find similar-minded students and enough resources to work on personal design projects and teachers to mentor (I have personal wishes to develop a software for helping disabled people and another computer program to develop drug delivery system and participate in various tech competitions like Microsoft Imagine Cup, BIOMOD design competition etc. That\u2019s why I am curious if I will find proper teammates and resources)?\n3. Everybody says at a small school like Amherst, it is way easier to land research positions. But is it really that easy? What should one do if he wants to land an independent position during any random semester in the 1st or 2nd year (not as part of the SURF)?\n4. Another question about research, how broad and diverse are the research scopes and areas? Like at big research universities, students do research like it is a regular eca. And the labs they work on are so diversified. A junior year girl I know from MIT studying cs, during her stay on the campus, she worked on a data science project led by a professor of MIT Sloan business school, then did another research at the MIT's KAVLI astrophysics research institute and worked on a machine learning project regarding cell function in space, then did another research at MIT Broad institute on machine learning for detecting antibiotic resistance. So none of her research labs were part of the CS department but she got cs related research jobs at so many labs, the opportunities were not limited to only cs labs or professors. Is it possible to find this kind of diverse position at diverse labs at Amherst?\n5. I know its perks, but still want to hear from a student who had real experiences. What are the benefits you got for being small classes and how much attention you really got from professors as an individual student?\n6. Any notable employers (any field- finance, business, cs, tech) which come to or regularly recruit Amherst students? Does Amherst organize any seasonal or annual career fair?",

I can assure you that Amherst students (unlike the New England weather) are cheerful/excited/brilliant/warm/outgoing/welcoming students and that you wont regret coming here.\n\n1. yes, personally i like having a small group of friends that I can call my own but if youre looking for something bigger, joining club sports is a great way. row/club soccer/ ultimate frisbee\n2. yes, but understand the things here will be more small scaled and are mostly personally driven. most clubs/projects are because students like yourself are passionate about certain things. you will get funds to be able to start your own club / do your own projects if you so inclined. \n3. yes, talk to professors and ask if you can help, you most likely wont get something your freshman fall but spend that time getting to know professors and being an outstanding student in those classes so they see you're passionate\n4. hmm for CS/programming its pretty applicable to a different bunch of fields so id say yes. in my personal experience, i did programming for the Center for Teaching and Learning / Statistics Department / local community organization \n5. everything people tell you about small schools and small classroom sizes is absolutely true. and the professors at amherst genuinely care about us the students like no joke. like they will reach out if they see youre struggling and will share with you their lives. Ive been to professors houses for dinner, went out to get meals with them, they bake us cookies, take us on hikes. you will not get that at a bigger institution.\n6. big consulting firms come here a lot like Bain, McKinsey, EY etc but i dont recall big tech (regardless many amherst people go on to work at FAANG etc, i have two peers interning at Microsoft rn for instance even tho our CS deparmtnet is meh)",

Yes, currently I had grown some negativities regarding Amherst and I know it's really bad but hopefully, everything will change after going to the campus.\n\nCan you say one more thing? Do Amherst students have a history of participating in big tech or case competitions? Like big research unis like Stanford, MIT are famous for their acm icpc, solar car teams, Harvard is popular for their case and biomedical societies, NYU has a record number of awards in big business and entrepreneurial competitions. Does Amherst have any spike in any competitions related to tech or designing?",

After a few weeks on the zee mee we all kind of broke out into our own smaller groups to chat with over the summer instead of talking on one big group. Sorry to hear you\u2019re feeling bummed out though, that sucks. But we\u2019re definitely not un engaged, and we\u2019re all super friendly! I think once we get to campus stuff will be a lot better. Also, try the snap gc! A bunch of people have been dropping their tags, so I think I think people might be more active on there.",

I also think SC is more active, but unfortunately can't install the app on phone coz no space left. But I think we should engage in conversation in a big group, cause we are already a very small college. Nonetheless, looking forward to meeting everyone on-campus.",

And by the way, I\u2019m also majoring in CS, and after doing weeks of research on the strength of the program I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll both be fine. I reached out to the department head and asked him how well graduates to after leaving Amherst, and how they competed with other schools. He essentially said that their teaching methods are fairly similar to other schools with highly ranked programs, and that Amherst graduates had no trouble landing jobs at top companies after graduation- plus, Amherst\u2019s internship program is apparently fantastic. Also, they do a super cool program where 12 students go to Silicon Valley and basically intern with major companies to get a start on their careers. So I\u2019d say don\u2019t worry too much!",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm a prospective transfer student, looking to study neuroscience. While browsing Amherst College's neuroscience faculty, I notice that no one has research I am interested in. However, while looking across the consortium, I notice that there are several faculty at Mount Holyoke College that conduct research I am interested in (Kenneth Colodner, Kathryn McMenimen). Is it unheard of, or forbidden for Amherst College students to do undergraduate research with faculty across schools? I'm a male, so it's not as easy to just apply to Mount Holyoke College.",

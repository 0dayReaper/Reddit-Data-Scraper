            "comment": "The best advice I can give you for these types of questions is to not think too much about what you think they want to hear and more about what you feel comfortable sharing and how you can use that story to highlight your strengths. I will say just flat out saying \"I experienced this ism every day and it's frustrating\" is going to be a very common story that any college will read on the applications.   \n\n\nI'm not sure which part of the Common App you're talking about (personal statement, supplement, or the add more), but, for example, if you wish to share information about your relationship with your sister, frame it in a way that shows how you got better or how it inspired you to do something. Did your experience with your sister make you realize you wanted to follow this career? Or did it teach you an important thing about yourself (you're resilient, know how to set up boundaries, etc.)? If you'd like to talk about the ism you experience, make sure to tie it into this as well. For example, a student I coach is writing about the pressures they feel about being a first born child in an immigrant family and how that taught them the importance of overcoming any challenge that comes their way. Instead of it being about the frustrations or toll it takes on them, it's about how this experience taught them skills to be better.\n\nTLDR: Stop trying to figure out what the schools want and just be genuine. Every college is going to read thousands of applications and they will probably see every story under the sun. College admissions would rather hear about how you personally dealt with things and how that helped become the person you are today. Plus, it is really easy to tell when someone is being genuine versus someone who is just writing it because they think it looks good. No matter what you pick to write about (ism or your family relationships) make sure it's framed less as a sob story and more about how it has improved you or inspired you.",

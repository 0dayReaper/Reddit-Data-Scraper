I was wondering if there is any nice/friendly teacher I could work with on a research project (or anything for that matter) in economics/political science. Any help would be much appreciated.",

I'm not intimately familiar with the econ/polisci departments, but I do know people who are, and they're doing really amazing things alongside some professors. Usually students don't do research/internships until *at least* the summer after freshman year, if even that. More commonly, internships/research starts to occur the summer after sophomore year. Don't stress about needing to connect with a prof right now. Focus on having a good time in HS :)",

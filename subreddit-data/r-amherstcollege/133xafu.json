Amherst has enough prestige, and many people here turned down Ivy\u2019s (I turned down 3 and a top 10 as a transfer student). For context, every year, a few students turn down HYP for Amherst. Again, just go where you'll be happiest, as all will open similar doors\n\nOld Reddit post detailing which schools people chose Amherst over: https://www.reddit.com/r/amherstcollege/comments/mvkuw4/which_schools_did_everyone_here_pick_amherst_over/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1",

            "comment": "First of all, congrats on getting into those schools. They're all amazing schools and you will surely thrive in all three. Name prestige wise, I would have probably chosen Yale but if you're choosing based on fit which is the most important factor to consider, I would have chosen Amherst if I had to do it all over again. Yale is nice but it's situated in New Haven and my friends say you really feel the college bubble over there while at Amherst, the college is basically in downtown Amherst so I felt a sense to participate in the community outside of school. I'm also a country mice (as opposed to a city mice) so I liked the pastoral and serene background that is Western Mass. But you are only a 2 hour bus ride from Boston and 3-4 from NYC so weekend trips were definitely doable.  \n\nDo you like big classes or small classes? I'm currently doing a masters at harvard where my classes are 2-3x the class sizes at Amherst and I feel so unseen and unheard sometimes. When I'm sitting in a big lecture hall, I just sort of zone out and start mindlessly scrolling on my laptop but when I'm sitting at a table with 6 other students and the professor is right up in my face, I feel like I have to participate. I think Amherst facilitates making those connections while at bigger schools, you have to really go out of your own way to make these connections with your professors. \n\nAre you planning to go to grad school? Many people from Amherst go to Ivies and other top institutions after graduating as Amherst prepares them really well since close relationships with professors mean better letters of recommendations.\n\nAre you looking for the stereotypical college experience? Maybe choose a bigger school, a small school like Amherst is probably not the best place to go.\n\nBecause we are such a small school, I think Alum are also that much more willing to bat for us and help us out. Our pool of alumni might be smaller (much smaller) compared to the other 2 but I think that encourages us to help each other out even more. But probably Yale or Columbia has better networking / career development resources. iirc not many career fairs happened at Amherst while at bigger schools, fairs happen all the time. I think we are very chill and notcutthroat are atleast on the surface it appears that way. Everyone is super friendly and nice but maybe you're super competitive and a grinder and a city like NYC would suit you better.\n\nOverall, I felt like my time at Amherst was this dreamlike, ephemeral 4 year escapade in the pioneer valley. I don't know how much it prepared me the rest of my life but I had a pleasant experience overall.",

I in no way feel at odds with my peers, so its easy to make friends. Problems I have with social makeup or anything similar would likely be exacerbated by an ivy, tbh. When I think the people here can be pretentious I imagine Yale",

If you would thrive in one, you\u2019ll be frustrated in the other.\n\nFor one, basic thing, Great Books required curriculum versus open curriculum. Amherst trusts students to have both the preparation and insight to choose their classes, rather than having them imposed.\n\nAmherst recs really have weight. \n\nThat approach bodes well for grad school. It also allows individual bright students to shine, regardless of competition. Almost eliminates competition and fosters collaboration, helping others meet personal goals.\n\nAmherst, if you have financial need, blows Columbia out of the water by meeting your needs. About a $30K total difference.\n\nMy first year at Columbia, I spent more time in the city than on campus, and my campus relationships suffered. They unfortunately were not balanced by my city relationships, though conceivably they could be. There\u2019s a reason Columbia says the city is your classroom. At Amherst, they pay for you to take professors to lunch at the faculty club to help oil those relationship. (Chicago does this too, great idea.) It is easier to get recs, academic opportunities at Amherst or similar LACs as an undergraduate. I have a child that is not an honor student, but has been able to get academic opportunities, jobs, and recs at a LAC by showing interest and positively interacting with professors. \n\nColumbia is the stingiest Ivy, in my opinion. High costs, smaller endowment, less alum loyalty.\n\nColumbia alum, current Amherst mom. advised against both Cornell and Columbia for my kids based on personal experience. Not to say that CU and CU aren\u2019t the perfect schools for advanced studies or for others, depending on goals and personality.\n\nAmherst is over 200 years old. Columbia is an old colonial college, but its personality and mission were transformed under Nicholas Murray Butler from undergraduate focus, LAC, to a German-style regimented education.",

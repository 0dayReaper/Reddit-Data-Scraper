As for a taser/pepper spray, it\u2019s not needed. Campus is like it\u2019s own separate entity, super safe and the only people really on campus are students or staff. We don\u2019t have any issues with crazies making their way into campus.",

Saferide is a student driver network with college vehicles that work pretty deep into the night that can ferry you anywhere on campus for no cost.",

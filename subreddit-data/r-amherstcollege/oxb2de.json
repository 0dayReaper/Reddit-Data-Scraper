I do think the stigma is somewhat unwarranted though....\n\nHonestly, UMASS only has good food because it has more options but I was not blown away the few times I went there.",

I haven\u2019t eaten in Valentine since 2016 but I thought it was fine.\n\nBy the way, there was self-serve hard-pack ice cream before the 1994 renovation.  And\u2026 I date myself.",

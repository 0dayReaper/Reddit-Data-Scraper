Everyone has hobbies but what is your passion? And how have you shown that passion through the things you\u2019ve done? How has your passion helped you grow and mature? What obstacles did your passion create? That\u2019s why essays matter a lot because they are a great place for you to talk about your passions or your extracurriculars and achievements. I\u2019m more interested in that than whether or not you like to exercise or read.",

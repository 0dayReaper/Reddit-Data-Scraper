How is the theatre department? Is Amherst effective in helping students find internships (and eventually jobs)?\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "1. Favorite has to be the student body. Amherst doesn't pit students against each other in terms of academics, and I've found that it fosters a really supportive and collaborative student body. I really don't think there's anything wholly objective that Amherst is lacking in, so my least favorite (personally) would have to be the winters. \n2. The student body. By virtue of the small campus, remote setting, small class sizes, and generous financial aid to both domestic and international students, there is a lot of diversity packed into a really tiny campus. This plus the point 1 above really makes Amherst a really unique experience that you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else in the States.\n3. The housing is great. I think it's really nice that housing is guaranteed for all 4 years, so you don't have to stress about finding a lease/having long commutes on and off of campus. It also feels a lot safer living on campus than if you were to live off campus in the city. The food gets a bad rap, and its kinda a meme to make fun of it, but I think its really whatever you make of it. The college does a good job of trying to accommodate the diverse food needs of a small population, and the hours of the dining hall (which would have been my only complaint 2 years ago) have been getting better.\n4. No clue, but I could ask a friend if you're really curious \n5. Yes, and yes. At Amherst, you benefit from having super accessible advisors. Not only academic advisors, but also career/future planning/funding etc. They each only advise a small group of students, so you'll very quickly form personal relationships with them as well. I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Aronson (the premed advisor), as he's been such a great help to myself and the other premed kids. The one thing that you may not see about Amherst in the college guides and such is just how strong our alumni network is. It is one of those things that are kinda on the students to explore themselves, but the alumni directory is a great place to connect with established alumni and get internships or mentorships from. It is also a place where you can get some pretty powerful referrals from as well. There is a program for students called the Charles Hamilton Houston Internship Program that finds summer internships/jobs hosted by either Amherst alumni or partners that are ONLY for Amherst students. That is huge in securing great internships while at Amherst, and affords Amherst students many many opportunities that would be impossible to get anywhere else. \n\nHope this was helpful, please feel free to ask anything if something else comes to mind",

            "comment": "1. My favorite thing about Amherst is the professors. They genuinely care about us so much its insane. I came from a public high school where teachers/counselors were often inundated and lacked the resources to adequately help all the students but the professors will literally drop what they are doing and help you out if you reach out. They invite you their house for dinner, to hikes, ask you to babysit their kids for them, the bonds created are so strong.\n2. My least favorite thing is probably the humidity and cold. Blows.\n3. Honestly, any LAC is like any other LAC when it comes to the individuals and professors that inhabit them. Some things that make us stand out is our open curriculum which really embodies the LAC mentality. But also, even if a curriculum is not open, many top schools have shaped their curriculum to be holistic and very intersectional. Some may even argue that an open curriculum may dissuade people from taking courses outside their comfort zones and only take classes they feel like they would succeed in. A more rigid and guided curriculum could then theoretically ensure students are exposed to potential subjects outside their comfort. I think it really depends on you as a person. I'm like sort of willing to go outside my comfort zone so every semester, I do three STEM classes and one humanities class where I force myself to read and write but there are others who solely take one type of course or people who really take advantage of the open curric and take all sorts of classes. \n4. No AC for the most part so its lowkey brutal but people keep coming here so are we masochists or is there something else about this school that appeals to us? Who knows.\n5. Food is okay.\n6. I can't really speak on it but I think the theatre program is really welcoming to new people. They have these 10 min play ideas where anyone can submit a play and if its approved, they will do a 10min performance of it. \n7. Yes, absolutely yes. When the pandemic began, my internship got cancelled but an Amherst Alum offered an internship knowing student's were getting cancelled. Our alumni network is not wide (given our size) but it is deep and alum are very kind about helping us.",

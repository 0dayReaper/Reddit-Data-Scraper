We are sure you are all swamped with various college acceptances and if you guys need that little push to come to Amherst, I'm more than happy to chat with you all as a senior here at Amherst. Best of luck choosing, and remember Roll Mammos! \n\n(And to those who did not, this year was tough and not getting in is not indicative of your potential. I'm proud of you all regardless :))",

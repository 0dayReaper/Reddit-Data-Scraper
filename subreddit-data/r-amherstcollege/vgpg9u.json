She's a fantastic facilitator and is great at getting students to use text to support their points.\n\nI also love Music-101 with Schneider. I never really appreciated the difference in eras of classical music (despite playing violin for much of my upbringing) and that understanding has made me seek out classical/opera ever since.",

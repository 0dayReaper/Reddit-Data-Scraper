Does anyone know what exactly can make them want to take the acceptance back when it comes to grades. Do you think they'll be lenient this year because of online learning? I'm literally on 2% in life and am so tired of everything but also I'm worried that getting a C in my AP Calc class wouldn't look so hot. I could explain that I'm the only one in all my classes that's remote, that I can't hear my classes bc the school mics are shitty, and that I feel super alone but would they care about any of that? Again sorry if this is annoying to anyone I just really don't want to lose my financial aid or acceptance.",

You will probably get rescinded from everywhere and not end up going to college, but rather living at home for the next two years wondering where it all went wrong. jk unless you do something really bad, Amherst won't care",

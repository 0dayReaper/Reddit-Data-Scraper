Amherst has been dead and gone for a long time. No one cared how he lived his life when things were named after him, and no one cares now. It affects no one's life. You losers need to get a life of your own instead of trying to destroy one that isn't around.",

And they banned smoking in bars and restaurants. And you can't drink and drive. The state banned happy hours in 1983. And you can't grope the ladies at the office anymore! What is the world coming to!!!1\n\nBut no one is ever canceled. No one is silencing anyone. Some people who are paid to express opinions might lose corporate sponsorship. Some people who believe in wild conspiracies or who spread lies in bad faith might be denied opportunities to present their ideas to live audiences. But no one is being canceled. The people being oppressed in this nation -the ones who lose sleep and are under tremendous stress- don't look like you and me. They are brown.",

Please pardon the interruption.\n\nI have a [change.org](https://change.org) petition to strip Lord Jeffery Amherst's name from the town of Amherst, Massachusetts. Amherst College is aware that the name is toxic like Trump. In 2018, the institution stripped his name off the hotel they own near the Common. It seems Amherst College knows that someday, the name of their institution and the town will also have to change. It won't be easy, but I propose we be proactive and start the process to rename it now, rather than leave the fix to the next generation.  As a sweet bonus, one of the better new names is that of a great woman (when does that happen in the USA?). Please take a look at my petition, and sign and share if you agree! Thank you.\n\nWrongs can be righted. And a really bad name selection in the 18th century should be corrected. The town and your prestigious institution would be better for it. Town first.",

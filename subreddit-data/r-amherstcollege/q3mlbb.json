    "postText": "Hey yall! So I'm planning to apply to Amherst ED (considering chemistry \\[not for any medical degree\\] and psychology/russian/idk). I did have some questions but I cant seem to find some of the info online and I couldn't get in contact with any admissions officers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Anyone who's majoring in sciences, how overwhelming are the 3-4 hour lab courses? Seeing that I may have to do 7 course hours per week for science w/lab kinda scares me, but if it's doable, I can make that commitment. I'm mainly worried because I will probably have to double up on sciences and 14 hours sounds like a lot\n\n2) Does getting a 5 on the AP Physics C Mechanics exam place me out of my Mechanics requirement as a chemistry major? Or does the 5 only apply for physics majors? Similarly, if I get a 5 on AP Chemistry, will I be able to take the more advanced \"gen chem\" class?\n\n3) Does only having a B.A. option for chemistry leave me with a lack of knowledge that a B.S. degree may have? Will I be missing some crucial math or science skills to apply to graduate school? Does Amherst do well in preparation to go for a Masters or even a PhD? \n\n3.5) I know since Amherst is only an undergraduate institution, there isn't groundbreaking research, but is there enough good research opportunities to fill out a resume \n\n3.75) Does Amherst have that \"prestige\" when applying for grad schools? I know that it's not a household name college-wise, but that doesn't concern me\n\n4) Is the teaching method for foreign languages different than in high school? (basically, is it more application based and not learning based if that makes sense?). Is there an option to get a certificate in a foreign language like Korean through the five college consortium? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone can give me more detailed information about pursuing chemistry, psychology, or a foreign language, could you DM me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "1. It should be possible to avoid taking more than one lab course at a time. In my experience, Labs rarely use their entire time slot.\n2. No idea\n3. Amherst briefly gave out B.S. degrees but stopped to double down on its identity as a liberal arts college. As an Amherst student, you would have the option to take exclusively natural science-oriented classes and end up with a more science-oriented education than students at other institutions. the BA/BS distinction is meaningless in this case.\n3.5 As far as I know, all of the science faculty are involved in research, so there is a lot here. You will not need to compete with grad students as an added bonus.\n3.75 No idea\n4. The different language departments do things differently. I am taking Japanese. Most of my classes have been one-on-one, and the classes that were not were never more than 3 students. We are assigned material to study and practice independently, we then practice what we studied with our professor when we meet.\n\nHope that helps.",

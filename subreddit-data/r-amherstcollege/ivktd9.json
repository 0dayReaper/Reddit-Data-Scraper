    "postText": "Asking this here because I really can\u2019t talk to my parents about it unfortunately when discussing college choices. So this is really my best shot.\n\nWhile I certainly did love Amherst College\u2019s campus and what I learned about its academics on my tour, as a lesbian prospective student I\u2019d be lying if I don\u2019t speculate about the # of gays at each college I visit. Amherst is a college even smaller than my high school and even here the gay population is pretty small, or at least the openly gay population is, and sort of concentrated in one 5-6 person friend group that I\u2019m personally not a part of.\n\n I think my main concern about going to a college like Amherst is that it would be sort of stifling because it sure even feels like that in the town I\u2019m living in now. I also heard Amherst is historically quite preppy and white, and I fit into neither category. Though I heard from some people that is a stereotype that is slowly being erased especially looking at the stats that say Amherst is now one of the most diverse campuses in the United States.\n\nTL;DR: How gay is Amherst College? Is it easy to meet other gay people whether that be as friends or more?\n\nAlso general question: Do you guys hang out with other people in the Five College Consortium? Or do people mostly keep to their own schools?",

They do a great job fostering community and a home away from home (or a home that you\u2019ve never had). But the community is there and you can be as involved as you want. Amherst even has a mini graduation ceremony for all senior students who are a part of the lgbt community. \n\nAmherst during my time was a diverse place and I almost never hung around the preppy, white population. You\u2019ll find your crowd pretty quickly and it doesn\u2019t need to involve anyone that you don\u2019t mesh with. If you seek diversity you\u2019ll find it. \n\nThe blessing for LGBT life was really the 5 college consortium. I think LGBT people at amherst are more connected to Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke and Smith because of this. Don\u2019t get me wrong - dating is still so so so tiny and everyone knows everyone.",

There\u2019s a Queer Resource Center on campus, so that\u2019s a physical space with a couple of queer events per week. There\u2019s also gay specific parties that happen every few weeks. You can also take queer history classes, which tend to be like vast majority queer students. Last semester I took Queer people in pop culture, and 24/25 students plus the prof were queer. Basically, I think you\u2019ll be chill on the queer stuff. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if this is possible for you, but Jxhn is the head of the QRC and they\u2019d be happy to talk to you about anything over zoom or email. Their email is jsmartin@amherst.edu\n\nAs for the college consortium, I know the other colleges use it more than we do. Amherst tends to stay pretty secluded, although you will have one or two people from other colleges in some classes. Most events are open to all the colleges, but there only tends to be lots of people from other colleges at the bigger events. Basically, taking classes elsewhere it totally normal, but the majority of your social life will most likely be with the Amherst college community.\n\nFeel free to dm me with any questions, and good luck!",

Or are you talking about Elton John-Adam Lambert-Rachel Maddow types who seem pretty LGBQT the second you meet them? \n\nJust curious.",

Like they want be in full ass costumes or anything wild, but there\u2019s a lot of people who have flags all over their dorms or just give off the super gay vibes (I legit met one of my best friends because they were sitting around in flannel looking gay af and I was like fellow gay?). Also, if you\u2019re super oblivious (like me sometimes), you can just hang in the Queer Resource Center and the gays will come to you.\n\nI know there are a lot of not obviously gay people somewhere round here though, cause I had a SWAGS class full of them and I was like oh wow even more gays. I guess I just don\u2019t know about them as much, since you have to actually become friends with some people to find out about their queerness, and I prefer fairly small friend circles.",

While preparing for my trip, I learned about the upcoming summer break and became curious about what other travelers have planned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I am on a tight budget and would appreciate some advice on affordable modes of transportation and destinations to consider. I have always wanted to visit New York City and places on the East Coast and would love any tips or recommendations on how to make this trip happen within my budget.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease feel free to share your travel plans and any suggestions you may have in the comments. Thank you in advance for your help",

Their marketing team is the fucking worst and uses a fake  Reddit account to ask a question eerily similar to yours on dozens of college subreddits, and then uses another fake account to respond as a previous customer saying you should use OurBus because of its cheap and blah blah blah. May not be illegal, but I\u2019d consider it unethical. Idk why they don\u2019t just use an official account and post their promotions. I\u2019d sure trust you\u2026.err *them* a lot more",

I\u2019ve never used OurBus so I can\u2019t speak on its services, but I would absolutely rather pay Peter Pan $25 than support this manipulative company.\n\n\n- Sherlock Holmes",

    "postText": "I\u2019ll be a freshman at Amherst this fall and I\u2019m a bit concerned abt how my social will hold up there. Umass is like 5 minutes away though; Would it be at all plausible to enjoy a social life at Umass while still going to Amherst? Like going to parties on the weekend for example. Do Umass kids have any predisposed hate/dislike towards Amherst kids? Thanks\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

It\u2019s not unheard of for Umass kids to come to Amherst, and other five college students visit every weekend. It\u2019s a fairly inclusive scene!",

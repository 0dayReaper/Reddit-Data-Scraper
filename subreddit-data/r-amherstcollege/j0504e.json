Being on my own in what was meant to be a double has been really nice since it's allowed me to get used to college life without navigating a relationship with a roommate. There are definitely parties on the weekends where there are way too many kids and I've seen some drinking, but we haven't had any new covid cases in about a month so I'm less concerned than I was at the beginning of the semester. I stay out of that scene though and there's plenty of fun stuff to do like movie nights, karaoke, visiting the museums and the farm, or anything you put your mind to. I'm lucky to have 2 in person classes which operate pretty normally, though my zoom class is definitely a little rough to get through just bc I get tired of staring at a screen. I'm so glad I got to be here for this first semester despite the weird restrictions! I've met some incredible people and it's really reassured me that I picked the right place. No word on spring though ://",

From what they\u2019ve said, absolutely no parties or really gatherings of any kind. You have your own dorm room to yourself, and have a few friends in a housing group (you pretty much just live close to each other) and those are pretty much the only people you can interact with. You\u2019re not allowed to leave campus. Haven\u2019t heard anything about classes, but some of mine went online only whether I was there or not. Radio silence from the school regarding spring plans.",

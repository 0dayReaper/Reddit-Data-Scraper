    "postText": " \n\nHello Everyone,\n\nI got into the Amherst class of 2025 with a full ride. I know Amherst is an extremely prestigious and awesome college. But I will 95% chance, will enter an occupation in CS or any other engineering field in future. So I had some questions.\u2019\n\n1. How is Amherst College in general for any one of these STEM subjects- CS, Math &amp; Statistics and Physics.\n2. What kind of teaching I will get at Amherst for one of the subjects (any of the 3 majors mentioned)? Is it teaching-oriented or research-based? Will I be able to learn industry-based knowledge like landing a job at Silicon Valley or starting my own startup for any of these majors?\n3. Does Amherst college have popularity in one of these majors? do top CS and engineering companies recruit people from Amherst on a regular basis?\n4. Research and extracurricular opportunities in any of the fields?\n5. What is the alumni scenario? Is there any estimated salary Amherst alumni may earn?\n6. Estimated percentage of students entering top US graduate schools like Stanford or MIT for ENGINEERING and CS?\n7. For STEM, as far as I know everything is located in the New Science Center. Is it too facilitated with labs and equipment for major physics or biological research?",

            "comment": "Hey congratulations first of all!\n\n1. We're decent, I don't think there's anything notable about our programs (coming from a Math/Stats major)\n2. Teaching oriented, I'm not sure what you mean by researched based. I don't think you'll learn industry knowledge. For instance, our CS programs starts with OOP programming using Java and teaches theoretical CS from Data Structures to Algorithms. I don't think you'll learn JavaScript or various frameworks, too niche.\n3. I think CS is growing every year and lots of CS majors at Amherst go off to work/intern at FAANG and top companies. \n4. Yes, talk to professors and see how you can help them.\n5. Very helpful alumni, we have one of the highest alumni donation rates if that is any indication of alumni love for their school. \n6. I don't even know, Im sure its googable tho\n7. yeah thats where all the science stuff is. Math/Stats is located in Seeley Mudd",

The thing is I also got into the University of British Columbia with a full ride in Canada which is a huge institute for engineering and CS research. But as it is in Canada, I was thinking there can be a negative edge when applying to top US grad schools because I hear US grad schools value local degrees over an international one, don't know tho if it is true or not. So considering this US grad school probability thing and all the academic sides, will it be wise for me to go to Amherst than UBC if I want to pursue a CS or engineering major in the future?",

I do think that international vs local won't matter as long as you can succeed, so the question now is which place do you find yourself succeeding? Amherst is small and won't have the resources and research opportunities that UBC might have. There's various factors as well but if engineering is something you want to do (still have no idea what engineering means) UBC sounds great. We don't have an engineering major nor majors like communications/business marketing. It's more general majors like \"English\" or \"Economics\" whatever that means but we do emphasize a holistic well roundedness to education, focusing on critical thinking skills/soft skills instead of really specific stuff.",

            "comment": "1. The math department is wonderful. Professors are so understanding, kind, and knowledgeable. The statistics and CS departments are a mixed bag. Certain professors in stats/CS are awful lecturers and unjust graders. \n2. Amherst professors are definitely here to teach (though many are world-class researchers in their own right). They are invested in students' success and really care about pedagogy. I've worked with professors as they developed courses and they always put students' interests first--something rare at a lot of research universities. I will say that courses don't focus on industry-based knowledge--a lot of material is more abstract and high level. Let me put it this way: Amherst will teach you everything you need to learn, but if you want to master something, you will need to put in a lot more effort on your own time. For instance, when I went through the recruiting process for data science, courses had taught me how to write SQL, but I had to do a lot more drills to feel prepared for the technical interview.\n3. Out of the majors you've listed, math is definitely the most popular. A lot of people who major in math go the finance/economics route, or they have an interest in pure math. CS is probably the second most popular, followed by physics and stats. The statistics department is relatively new and small. Regarding recruitment: if you want to work at Facebook, Microsoft, etc etc, reach out to Amherst alums who work there for a referral. I did this and alums were able to push my resume through in a lot of instances. I also think that Amherst is a target school for Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, but I'm not sure.\n4. There's a lot of research opportunities. Since most professors have research funding, it is VERY, VERY easy to get a research gig. (I can't emphasize just how accessible research is for Amherst students in comparison to other institutions!) In most cases, once you find a professor whose research you like, you can reach out to them and they'll take you on. If you have an individual project that you want to do, you can request research funding from a pot of money and work on it with a professor of your choosing. You can also write an undergraduate thesis.\n5. I don't know the median salary off of the top of my head, but they do very well!\n6. Again, I don't know this number off of the top of my head. I will say that a lot of Amherst people are business-oriented and end up in consulting or investment banking versus graduate school.\n7. Yes, the science center is equipped with a bunch of labs. I don't do physics, so I can't elaborate on the specifics, but I hear that they have a lot of resources. The math and statistics departments have their own building separate from the sciences.",

I am not talking about Dartmouth dual degree program, I am talking about going to top engineering grad schools from amherst doing a bachelor in physics or math and landing a job in the engineering industry?\n\nStudents, who graduate from a LAC like Amherst College with a mathematics or physics degree, do they face obstacles to get into a top grad school like Stanford or MIT for a master's or Ph.D. in engineering branches? Do they have a disadvantage regarding getting accepted? Also, how often LAC graduates get into engineering industrial jobs with a physics degree?",

    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nso i am an incoming freshman at Amherst, and I am considering the premed track. I have a small question though: Is it manageable to double major in neuroscience and statistics? I am really interested in both majors and can't choose one over the other, but I am thinking that is not a good idea considering how heavy the neuroscience requirements are. Any advice? Also, if there are any premed students willing to chat, that will be great. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Neuro senior here, not premed. It is possible to double major and complete all the coursework for both majors and premed requirements (the neuro major alone covers most of them), the issue is mainly how heavy your coursework will be, you may not be able to do a thesis simply due to time/course restraints. Is it manageable? Yes, I\u2019ve met people who have done it all, however most of those people were suffering and were not having a good time. Your time at Amherst will probably be more enjoyable if you do one track or the other with premed.",

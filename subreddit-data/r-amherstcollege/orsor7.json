    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman to Amherst College and when I checked the Student Account Statement on ACData I noticed that the health insurance is quite expensive, and when I tried to waive the insurance, it was declined. I was thankfully informed by a student currently attending Amherst about a scholarship that covers the cost of the insurance. I am not too sure on the specifics, but if you meet the requirements, and youre having issues with the waiver, please check out the link below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/Health\\_Insurance\\_Request\\_21-22.pdf](https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/Health_Insurance_Request_21-22.pdf)",

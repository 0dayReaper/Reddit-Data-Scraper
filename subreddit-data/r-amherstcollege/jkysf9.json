They do something about every two or three weeks, which is pretty cool. I think there are other groups on campus that just aren't running at the moment, though I could be wrong. I know a lot of my friends are involved in theater in one way or another and seem to love it here.\n\nSorry I can't help more!!",

            "comment": "If you know where to find them, there are a few five-college collective groups. Five College Dance Dept is the only one I'm familiar with, but if dancers can perform at all 5 colleges, theater and music people should be able to, too. Hampshire has GORGEOUS creative spaces, even if the humans who go there can be a bit...much sometimes, so I highly recommend getting yourself over there at least once. Not certain what's going on with Covid and 5-college collabs, or even Hampshire, since last I heard it was kind of broke. \n\nAmherst has SO MANY acapella groups, and their orchestra isn't shabby either. Honestly, the only thing preventing you from doing more with the 5 colleges is time. It takes time to get to/from other campuses, and depending on courseload/jobs/etc., that's where you'll run into issues. I couldn't read/do homework on the bus (yay motion sickness) and wasn't blessed with friends with cars, so largely stayed on campus. I was also double-majoring, and scheduling any trips off campus for performances and stuff was a nightmare. But the theater department at Amherst, though small, is wonderful. If I had had the capacity, I would have triple-majored (theater and dance being the 3rd major). Wendy Woodson is a lovely (if...odd, in the way that creatives are) human being who helped me navigate the complications of the double major and passion for the THD department. \n\nSorry if I rambled a lot.",

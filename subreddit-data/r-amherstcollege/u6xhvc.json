    "postText": "Hi all! I'm considering committing to Amherst, but I just wanted some more info on the athlete/non-athlete divide. I plan on doing a club sport, but I haven't been recruited or anything. I realize that a lot of people on the '26 pg are recruited athletes. I've also watched some vids on  amherst, and it seems like athletes are usually closest w their fellow athlete friends. I'm not looking for an extremely cliquey school, so should this divide deter me from going?",

            "comment": "There are a lot of athletes here. I think some statistics reported over 50% are athletes in some shape or size. They do tend to be closest with their fellow athletes which makes sense since they hang out with them all the time. This is not a bad thing nor is it a weird thing. Think of every school or anywhere in life, you are friends with people you hang out the most with.\n\nNow can it get cliquey? Hmmm honestly, I think the athlete / non athlete divide is the less cliquey division. I would say wealth disparities and identities like race/ethnicity are more apparent to me IMO. I really don't know where I'm going with this, much like everything else I write but rest assured, that if you come here, you will find your own clique and friend group!\n\nAlso, when I say clique, don't think about it in a high school kind of way where its the Heathers and they bully everyone for not being pretty. Instead, everyone respects everyone but everyone has their own group that they like to hang out with.  Best of luck choosing! Roll Mammos.",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t tell you whether or not it should deter you from coming, but I can definitely tell you the divide is very real. It hasn\u2019t been a big impediment to my time here bc I\u2019m mostly past of activities where athletes tend not to migrate, but it makes the going out scene super divided. I don\u2019t go out at all anymore because I\u2019m never in the mood for a mens soccer/womens volleyball mixer etc and that\u2019s mainly what you\u2019ll find. It\u2019s ultimately up to you/what you\u2019re looking for. Don\u2019t let it be the only reason you don\u2019t come here if you\u2019re otherwise really excited about Amherst.",

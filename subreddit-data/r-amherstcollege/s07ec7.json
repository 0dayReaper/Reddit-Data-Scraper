    "postText": "Hello! I am applying to Amherst this year and it is one of my dream schools. I spent a lot of time in highschool doing art, hence I am submitting an art portfolio.\n\nHowever, to my understanding an arts portfolio can only be submitted with the additional letter of recommendation from an arts teacher/mentor/ etc. I filled out the request form days ago, and got a confirmation email of me sending it, but my teacher hasn't received any kind of information regarding the letter of rec yet. It is due tomorrow, and I emailed the admissions office if there was any error or missing steps I should take. I didn't make typos in my teacher's name or email or anything, and from another classmate who applied with the arts portfolio I did the exact same steps as he did.\n\nWill it affect me badly in the chance that the arts supplement gets cancelled due to the lack of a letter of rec? Is there anything else aside from emailing admissions that I can do?\n\nThank you so much!!",

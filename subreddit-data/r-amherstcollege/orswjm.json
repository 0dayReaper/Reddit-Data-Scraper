I hate to give my secret study spot away, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s widely known that smudd is open 24/7, and it\u2019s definitely my go to when I need somewhere to go after frost closes. The only downside to smudd is that the vending machine seems to be always broken. I don\u2019t really get the appeal of science center at all, I feel like it\u2019s way too distracting. I especially don\u2019t get how people are posted up in the wide open atrium of the science center studying during the day time.",

And arms! Arms is really cool too as a study place.\n\nLeast favorite is Frost 3rd level, all the heat rises and it gets unbearably stuffy. No can do.",

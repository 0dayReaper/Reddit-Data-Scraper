Head of school offered to write a recommendation letter to me, but unfortunately I cannot submit it because of the Amherst requirements. Do you think not having a head of school rec is a bid setback? (since he really showed me what am I within a community and not only in academic subject).\n\nOr maybe is there a way to deliver it anyway? Thank you!!",

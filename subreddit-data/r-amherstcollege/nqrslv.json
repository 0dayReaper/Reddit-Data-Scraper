I think you\u2019re overthinking it, this isn\u2019t an interview, it\u2019s just to get you a look at the college and hear the perspective of a student there. There really isn\u2019t much preparation to be had for it, it\u2019ll mostly be the guide talking at you for the duration while you listen, with a bit of time for questions at the end. There aren\u2019t any questions that would be inappropriate in the context of Amherst College that wouldn\u2019t be for any other university, so just use your judgement on what would be blatantly inappropriate.",

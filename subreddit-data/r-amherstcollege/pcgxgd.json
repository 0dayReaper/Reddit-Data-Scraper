    "postText": "Hi all! I am a senior who wants to apply to Amherst for CS (one of my dream colleges along with UIUC). I don't know if this is the right sub but I am trying to find interesting clubs, internships, research, faculty achievements, etc. Want to know more abt the college as I am passionate abt this college and I eventually need to write my Why X essay. Pls do help a fellow senior.\n\nP.S-I know most would recommend looking at the official CS website for searching up these kind of things but for some reason, I am not able to find anything abt clubs, research, etc. Any help would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "CS and Math major here. Straight up, Amherst isn\u2019t the school for you if you\u2019re looking to do CS with the intent of landing a tech job. You\u2019re better off going to a bigger state/research school (like UIUC). Amherst has a CS club which mainly does interview preps, hackathons and networking events (very pre-professional) and a few professors doing research. Most students in CS gets involved with research through either summer research   or thesis writing, with some pursuing it through out the semester. Lee Spector, Matteo Riondato, Scott Kaplan and Scott Alfeld are some names to look for. Try to read some of their papers to see who you\u2019re interested in. Their websites would be good resources too.",

            "comment": "One of the key selling factors of Amherst, well any Liberal Arts School is the liberal arts factor... so for your Why X essay, it will be important to reflect on a few questions:\n\n1. Why do you want to do CS?\n   1. Why at Amherst?\n      1. Will Amherst's open curriculum and LAC way of thinking supplement your CS abilities?\n      2. Are you solely doing CS or do you want to come to Amherst to explore different options, ultimately gaining the critical thinking and soft skills needed to succeed in any career?\n\nBe specific and genuine in why you actually want to come to Amherst. But honestly, CS at Amherst is subpar. Go to UW or Berkeley or some school with more funding. Then again, CS is like one of those fields that is really independent and self-driven so it really comes down to funding / research opportunities if you already know what you're interested in. But for people like me who are aimlessly wondering around, Amherst is great for me because I can explore different things and see if I like them.",

It helps to find a Prof from that department, and discuss a research paper or something from them that you really like to demonstrate that you're seriously interested in the school. That strategy works really well. If your into chem, bio, or Arabic I can point you to good profs to write about",

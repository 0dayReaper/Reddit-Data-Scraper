Amherst seems to offer so many things I want in a school.\n\nIs  there anyone here who's majored/is majoring in Poli Sci at Amherst?  How's your experience? Are there good opportunities for undergraduate  research?\n\nAlso, this is only tangentially related, but has anyone taken Persian with the Consortium? How is it?",

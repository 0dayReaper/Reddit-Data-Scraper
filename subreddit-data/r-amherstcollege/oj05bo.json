            "comment": "New England Weather is the most well-rounded imo. Each season is very distinct, like summer is summer and winter is winter if you catch my drift. It depends on the year but generally, there's a lot of snow and it is really cold. If you're from NYC, you'll be fine here at Amherst since you're used to east coast weather. The snow can get pretty deep but the crew does a great job at clearing paths super early so you really don't notice it.",

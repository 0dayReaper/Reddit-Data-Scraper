You can the small intros at Amherst, and then more specific classes at UMass when the class size narrows down. The professors are all lovely and super supportive. I know Kaplan is a massive advocate for taking care of mental health even if it means not completing work, and Gardner has been asking for feedback from everyone to try and make online learning as good as possible. \n\nGood luck with everything!",

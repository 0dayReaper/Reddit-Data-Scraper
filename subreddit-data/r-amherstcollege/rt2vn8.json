    "postText": "1) Any experiences with the geology program? The classes don't seem to be that extensive, but I haven't researched possible work/internship opportunities that deeply\n\n2) As a black student, how much would I have to worry about racism in the community, especially student group v student group or administration v student body. How much is a disconnect is there? Are students sort of weird/performative regarding racial issues? (DMs can work for this question)\n\n3) How tight-knit is Amherst? if I'm coming from an extremely small boarding school, is it much of an adjustment? how is the general community?\n\n4) How is the party scene? I don't need a big emphasis on partying but I wouldn't want a completely dead scene either. \n\n5) How prevalent is the divide between sports and the rest of the student body (socially)\n\n6) Is there an emphasis on school spirit? If not, what about the Amherst community makes it appealing to you?",

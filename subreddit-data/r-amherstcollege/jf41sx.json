The college is definitely super exciting to me! \n\nThe only thing holding me back is I\u2019m wondering if there are ample opportunities for research, shadowing, and clinical volunteering there. Is anyone here premed and in that case can they help me with this? \n\nMy decision is falling between UPenn and Amherst and I don\u2019t know which to pick :(",

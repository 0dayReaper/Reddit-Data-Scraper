The dining hall seemed alright but there\u2019s only one. Everything is a fairly short walk away on campus. There are great views. Many new modern buildings and older brick ones, all very nice. The new dorms looked amazing.",

            "comment": "Anything specific about the campus or just in general?\n\nOverall it\u2019s beautiful but kinda hilly. The buildings are spread out, but since it\u2019s a small uni everything\u2019s in walking distance. It snows about a foot in winter, which was definitely a highlight for me lol.\n\nFor specific details...\nThere\u2019s this amazing view from the memorial of the forest and mountains, so I always make sure to take people there. Sometimes, when I pass by, I\u2019ll just stop and enjoy it for a bit.\n\nThe science center is the newest building rn. It has a bunch of couches on the first floor, which are a nice place to chill. It\u2019s pretty modern looking, and it has roof lights that change color on the hour at night. I\u2019m not a physics major, but my friend is, and for some reason they have a lounge? So I\u2019ll chill on the couches in there too during their TA hours lol.\n\nThe library is also a great place to go (I\u2019m a nerd I know). The floors are split by sound, which works pretty well. I usually go to the second floor because I like low level noice while I study, but I\u2019ve been in the lower floors and honestly it\u2019s the most silent place I\u2019ve been in lol. It\u2019s almost freaky.\n\nThe resource centers are a great place to hang. You don\u2019t need to be a part of a minority, as long as you\u2019re accepting. I spend most of my time in the Queer Resource Center. There\u2019s usually a couple people there, so it\u2019s a chill place to hang out, and everyone\u2019s super friendly. Also- free food. I have never snacked so much lol.\n\nGood luck with everything and let me know if you have any other questions! :)",

I know stuff is kind of hectic now, and it\u2019s especially difficult to visit campus to check it out, so I thought I\u2019d offer to answer any questions people have coming in or applying.\n\nFor some info about me: I\u2019m both trans and bi, I\u2019m majoring in CS and debating majoring in SWAGS, last semester I did Zumba and horse riding (we\u2019ll see how that pans out lol), and I\u2019m a rising sophomore. \n\nFeel free to DM me or just reply to this post. If I don\u2019t know the answer to something, I\u2019ll try to connect you to the right people where possible.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

Things could have changed from then (it was 3 years ago) but be careful about putting all your hopes on Amherst. I kinda wish someone would've told me back then. That being said, good luck with your search! You might do better than I did!",

Does the college push students academically or can a student choose to not be as rigorous? What is the social scene like? I really don't want to go to a college with a crazy scene or huge parties. The AO on the zoom said that the college partnership makes the social scene a lot bigger whereas I would rather have a close knit community. Thank you for any answers!",

Teachers want you to do well, and they will push you, but most don\u2019t try to push you to \u201cget the top grade\u201d, but just improve. You have to be at least fairly rigorous, because there is a higher homework:class ratio and you\u2019re expected to do the homework, but I\u2019ve found it less stressful than high school where you have to worry about getting the top grades. Of course, you will probably feel more grade-stress if you plan to go to grad school, because then it does matter. \n\nThere are parties on campus, but it\u2019s completely possible to avoid them and still have fun. Personally, I dislike the amount of random people at parties, and therefore stick to generally hanging out with friends and going to club meetings. Since everyone lives on-campus, clubs can happen at any time, so it\u2019s fairly easy to fill a schedule with them :). Now, the parties do exist and you can\u2019t completely avoid them in all contexts. For example, if you walk around campus late on a Friday night, you may walk past a party or see some drunk students or something. \n\nFor the 5 colleges, it does make it bigger but people tend to keep an Amherst community as well, if that makes sense. Like some people will go to parties at UMass, or there might be multi-college events, and you may meet some people from other colleges in your class. However, the vast majority of people you interact with in class and in clubs will be Amherst students. I would treat the community just Amherst for most intents and purposes.\n\nGood luck with everything!",

The lacrosse team then got suspended for this season (this was before COVID). I\u2019m not sure of any recent updates on that.\n\nI also know that the Black Student Union has been pushing for more diversity in admin, because admin is not very diverse, unfortunately. It looked like Biddy was listening to the issues and working to fix them with the BSU, but that\u2019s in the beginning stages rn so I can\u2019t say how well it\u2019s going.",

Kaplan can be a bit disorganized sometimes, but he\u2019s very much in the mentality of \u201cmental health first\u201d, which means he\u2019s fairly chill about things like extensions. Gardner I had this past semester, as well as an advisor, and she\u2019s been asking all her advisees and students for as much feedback as possible to make sure she\u2019s not giving us too much. Rager is like ok? He was less accommodating for virtual learning (lectures weren\u2019t recorded so time difference was rough), which was annoying. He is fairly chill about homework and tests though, so like he uses the final as a grade booster only.\n\nAs for students, for the majority people have been pretty cool. The worst I\u2019ve seen is people just not wanting to work as a group, so we\u2019ll split the work and come together at the end, but even that seems to be a minority. There isn\u2019t much in terms of competiveness either. When I first started, I was super nervous about not being good enough, but everyone around me has been supper supportive and it\u2019s def helped my confidence a lot. The profs also do encourage group work as well, with I think Gardner doing it the most with mandatory study groups. \n\nThe only issue I really have with the CS department is it\u2019s problem with diversity, cause it does have one. Gardner is the only female prof, and there are no POC profs in CS. Even during hiring, they were looking at mostly white guys. Amherst is implementing some more anti-racism plans rn, so hopefully some of that will change, but it is disheartening to see so little diversity in the profs.\n\nDo you have questions about anything else to do with the department?",

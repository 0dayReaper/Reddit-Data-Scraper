    "postText": "After a thorough review of your application for admission to Amherst College, the Committee on Admission has decided,\nwith regret, not to offer you a place in the Class of 2020. In fairness to you, we have made a final decision at this time.\n\nNearly all the applicants we reviewed were academically qualified and had the enthusiastic support of their teachers and\nguidance counselors. Selecting among those applicants was a daunting task. Be assured, however, that each application was\nread in its entirety, recommendations were considered fully, transcripts were interpreted with care, and every case was\nreviewed more than once.\n\nWhile I know this outcome may be disappointing to you, I encourage you not to consider it an adverse judgment of your\nreadiness for college. Rather, it is primarily a consequence of the fact that Amherst is a small college that attracts a sizable\ngroup of well-qualified candidates each year; our decision largely reflects the unavoidable and significant constraints imposed\nby the limited number of spaces available in our first-year class. We are simply not able to offer admission to many\napplicants who could be successful students at Amherst.\n\nI greatly appreciate your interest in Amherst and the considerable time and effort you put into preparing your application for\nour review. I wish you the very best as you proceed with your college plans, pursue your educational aspirations, and move\nforward with confidence to well-deserved success in the future.",

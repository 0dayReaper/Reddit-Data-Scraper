    "postText": "I am interested in submitting a photography supplement, I have works from the last 3 years, and 1 or 2 photo series too. I found it hard to find portfolio examples so if anyone has submitted or will submit one too, can you let me know what are the things to consider while choosing the pictures?\n\nI intend to major in film and media studies. I take pictures with my phone, and also what you'd call a street photographer. I love capturing the life outside on a typical day.",

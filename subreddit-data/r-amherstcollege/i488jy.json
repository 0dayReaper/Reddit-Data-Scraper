            "comment": "An incoming international student here, from sub-Saharan Africa. I will try to answer all your questions as properly as i can. Remember I havent yet been to the school, so take my answers with a grain of salt?\n\n\n&gt;How difficult is it for int. students to get it?\n\nHey, I got in... Idk if it is easy or hard. But based on an email they sent us recently, and I quote, \"This year we had a historically large and diverse group of international applicants--a record total of 3,141 students applying from 140 countries and regions... Only 141 applicants were admitted\". Yeah based on that, it is so hard to get in. But again, i remind you, i got in.\n\n\n&gt;how's the financial aid like and am i being too hopeful\n\nThe financial aid is awesome. My package was good enough and i think i can comfortably attend. Plus amherst is need blind for internationals. \n\n\n&gt;\\-how is the film and media dept. like\n\nI am sorry i dont know this one.\n\n&gt;tips on writing the supplemental essay\n\nJust try to answer the prompt. Make sure you answer the prompt. It can be unique or not, depending on you. But the important thing is you answer the prompt. [Here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1LOVCNMBy711bEnePeluMQNwnFNPJemQt) are some essays of admitted students of the class of '24. \n\n\n&gt;general tips to stand out even as an int. student\n\nEssays are your best chance to stand out. Bring an international feel to your essay. Make sure your contribution can be seen on campus. \n\nAlso aim high on the SATs, but dont stress too much about them. Rember SATs matter more than you'd like, but less than you think.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have more questions.\n\nEdit: grammatical errors.",

I\u2019m an Art and the Practice of Art major, and I have some experience with the FAMS (film and media studies) faculty (who are often cross-registered between FAMS and Art)\u2014in particular Prof. Justin Kimball who teaches photography and by association Prof. Adam Levine who teaches film/video production. I have heard great things from Prof. Levine from both Prof. Kimball and his students, but Prof. Kimball himself is just excellent. His classes are part application and part lecture (like learning about different photos and their political/social contexts and implications or learning about the camera). He\u2019s super helpful and very understanding, and he\u2019s also a pretty famous photographer with many published art books! I\u2019m also friends with 2 FAMS majors and they\u2019re very cool down to earth ppl.",

Plus as previously said it is very difficult to make friends and plus the aid is very unpredictable usually worse than it's counterparts like Williams. Anyway it's yr call this is just my experience.",

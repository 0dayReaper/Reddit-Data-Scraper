    "postText": "I applied for Amherst last year and was rejected. However, due to Rona and uncertainty in my country about joining another college I have decided to give it a try again. I am also applying ED. Will my new application be overlooked because I was already rejected? Also, I have done an independent mathematics research during the quarantine. \n\nP.S.: I am an international student.",

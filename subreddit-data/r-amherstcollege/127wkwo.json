    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI'm a prospective '27 currently choosing between Amherst and Georgetown. I'm personally leaning towards Amherst, but I'm a bit worried about general recruiting/internship opportunities, especially given Georgetown's location right in DC. How are career services? Is the alumni network strong? Can the \"Amherst name\" get you an in in certain places? I'm looking to major in Economics, for context. \n\nAlso, does Amherst ever feel really small? I go to a fairly small HS (&lt;1000 students), and I've sometimes wondered if a bigger environment would be better for me. \n\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "Can\u2019t really answer your question directly, but here are some points you can consider:\n\n1) Being in D.C., Georgetown definitely has some advantages over most schools if you\u2019re looking for summer internship opportunities related to politics, think tanks, or government (or for Econ, perhaps also consulting for the federal government).  Outside of this, I think the D.C. advantage is mostly negligible\u2014but I\u2019m not an expert on D.C.\n\n2) If you do reasonably well, Amherst Econ will afford you ample opportunities. \n\n3) Amherst can absolutely feel small, especially after a bad breakup \ud83d\ude05 But being small is also why I chose it. I wanted a small liberal arts college where I had access to faculty and small class sizes\u2014and Amherst seemed like the best one that also wasn\u2019t in the complete middle of nowhere (*cough* Williams *cough*). \n\n\u2014\n\nThis isn\u2019t really a response to your question, just thought I\u2019d mention this just in case you weren\u2019t aware.  For law school, most go straight out of college since it\u2019s basically decided by your LSAT, GPA and professor recs.  Work experience can help, but that\u2019s really more of a factor for people going elsewhere (like the MBA route where GPA doesn\u2019t really matter).",

Great financial aid (if you\u2019re low-income), likely much better than Georgetown due to their endowment. You can take classes at local schools (Smith, UMass.) The big draw is its curricular flexibility similar to Brown. And of course, it\u2019s a liberal arts school, life of the mind place. You can get to Boston, but the Valley is not DC.\n\nI think Gtwn and Amherst are quite different. You\u2019ll prefer one over the other.",

I'm a freshman; potentially majoring in Computer Science and Gender studies, but I'm also taking Econ this semester. I do horse riding, zumba, electronics club and juggling club. I am bisexual and trans, so I know a lot about the queer shit. I also have a friend with a wheelchair, who will happily answer any disability questions through me (who is majoring in Physics and Math and wanted me to add that).",

Then he started the class off with a hypothetical.\n\n\u201cSo I did a lot of cocaine in college. \u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t expect the class to be that weird, for lack of better words. Sometimes we\u2019ll all randomly start singing, sometimes he tries to get us to finish random sentences, and sometimes we all put our hands up and yell \u201cfabulous\u201d. \n\nSo I guess I just didn\u2019t expect any of my teachers to be anything but super serious, although I\u2019m glad I was wrong.",

I went to Amherst and graduated and was, at the time, the only student with a visible disability. I had such a horrible experience that I refuse to give the college any money (and am in a position to donate, if that matters). I think back to things administrators said to me and I wonder how I handled any of it at the time. The current dean of new students once discouraged me from taking classes because of my disability, i was told not to do a thesis because \"someone like you can't do this,\" and Accessibility Services was a joke. I hope things have changed. \n\n(Ps--using fake account because my real one would be too identifiable. Not too many disabled people at Amherst. If having guidance from someone who has had far too much experience dealing with the ableism of Amherst administrators/professors would help your friend, message me.)",

They hired an outside consulting firm to come in and assess things; they did a series of listening sessions with various stakeholders and produced at report in the spring.\n\nAs a result, the administration has done a bunch of different things:\n\n* repaved a lot of walkways, roads, and curb areas and added more accessible parking, especially around Quadrangle Drive and Webster Circle\n* the online campus map is being updated to include the locations of all accessible (and van-accessible) parking on campus \n* created\u00a0[an online form for reporting barriers](https://www.amherst.edu/mm/594708)\u00a0to accessibility. \n* a new Committee on Student Learning is discussing accessibility-focused improvements to the learning environment\n* increased the staff in the Office of Accessibility Services\n* created an [updated accessibility webpage](https://www.amherst.edu/accessibility)\u00a0\n* In the spring plan to convene an ad hoc advisory group focused on accessibility considerations for the new Student Center.\n* hired an IT Accessibility Specialist (who is blind) and improved training on creating accessible documents, and updated the [IT accessibility webpage](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/it/knowledge_base/accessible-information-technology)\n\nSo I think the college has made some good headway, but in doing so has acknowledged that they were falling short in some significant areas in the past.\n\nDM me if you'd like a copy of the accessibility report.  I couldn't find it on the website, but it isn't marked as confidential.",

Here's some more context for you, point by point--not comfortable saying when I graduated, but happy to speak privately. Feel free to DM me. A lot of the work you're talking about was done by students. \n\n\\-couldn't speak to the repaving as I haven't been there in a while\n\n\\-getting this form up took at least two years and lots of arguing, as I recall most administrators weren't for it--in most jobs, not doing something for two years would get you fired. \n\n\\-a friend of mine and I literally did this work for them a while ago. They've been saying this webpage will be put up for, minimum, three years and likely longer. \n\n\\-great! But it doesn't make a difference if the people working in the office treat disabled students horribly. In my time at Amherst, and having spoken to current students, I have never met a student who had something uniquely positive to say about working with accessibility services. \n\n\\-This was written almost entirely by one polisci professor. Administrators didn't write it. DM me if you want more info/evidence. \n\n\\-good\n\n\\-the IT department is one of the few that has always taken accessibility seriously, so I'm glad to hear it. \n\nOn the consulting firm, I've heard from multiple people that none of the consultants were actually disabled (of course this is all secondhand, thirdhand in some cases) so I'm skeptical.  That said, I could be wrong on that point. For what it's worth, I also continue to get inaccessible alumni communications. \n\nI'm not sure in what department you work, but accessibility also varied a lot by department. Out of the three departments I was most heavily involved in, two were pretty good at accessibility and one was...eh. One of my professors once got to the point where she could say \"I think disabled people should have equal rights,\" but you could really tell she thought it was some radical position. Odd. \n\nHere is probably the most telling thing: after graduating, I immediately took a corporate job. I have had zero accessibility issues since starting work. I have so much more free time and can wake up in the morning and not have accessibility be the first thing I think about. I feel like a person and not Amherst's token disabled person. \n\nHappy to discuss further over DM.",

I got sidetracked by finals and holidays.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to report accessibility doesn\u2019t seem to have improved. I ran into a lot of problems dealing with them, especially before arriving on campus, including instances where I was told to get a lawyer because of attempts to break ADA. This advice came from multiple people including doctors I was seeing at the time.\n\nOverall, the campus is not the most nor the least accessible place I\u2019ve been. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a priority placed on making things more accessible than the bear minimum. People, other than the administration, have generally been kind and understanding, if a little misguided at times. \n\nOverall, my experience day to day has been generally good, but my experience working with the administration and accessibility office has been overall negative.",

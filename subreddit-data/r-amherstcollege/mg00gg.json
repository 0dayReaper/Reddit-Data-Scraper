    "postText": "Amherst is my #1 school and I'm not holding my breath to get in. At first, it didn't feel pleasant when thinking about the great possibility that I'll be rejected, but the fact is, some people's dreams are going to be made today, and that's beautiful. I've gotten some acceptances that I'm really grateful for and regardless I have great options, so I'll be looking forward to wherever I decide to attend. But to the people who find out they are accepted in about a hour (not counting myself out though lol) , that shit is amazing, as if you need me to tell you. Even if I do get a rejection, it'll sting a little less (just a little) knowing that students my age who put in so much work over their high school career did get to open an acceptance letter to this institution. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe an hour later: f\\*\\*\\* everybody",

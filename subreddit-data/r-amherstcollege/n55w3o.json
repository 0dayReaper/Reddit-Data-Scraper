    "postText": "Hi!\n\nApologies in advance for the wall of text.\n\nSo I am an incoming BU freshman for engineering and it's safe to say that that was more of a compromise. As someone who enjoys small, creative and intellectually stimulating environments, my heart  has always belonged with the environment of an LAC. However they are not exactly known for engineering and so I had to compromise. BU is a great school, and a scholarship and admission to the honors college were enough for me to be satisfied attending there.\n\nThat being said, I have begun to question my interest in engineering, and if I were to switch out of engineering I feel like I'd be happier at an LAC. \n\nI just want to ask... does that seem unrealistic? I know Amherst already has a low transfer acceptance rate and transferring from an engineering college at a large school probably wouldn't help too much.\n\nI don't want to come across as unsatisfied with BU. I have yet to even start there, and I'm sure I will likely love it there. However I also want to make sure if transferring were something I'd want to do, that I figure that process out now instead of not having a plan.",

Amherst\u2019s acceptance rate is very tough, and the transfer rate is even tougher, so I\u2019m not sure any of us can pass judgement on that. My inclination is that you need to have a clear academic reason for transferring (i.e. your current institution does not have the adequate infrastructure to support your academic interests &amp; pursuits), which it sounds like you definitely have.",

            "comment": "To echo /u/ElliotJustATech, you\u2019ll  need to clearly show that Amherst would better suit your needs than BU does. Also, to keep that door open, make sure you keep your grades up! I can\u2019t speak for everyone obviously, but I think most college students (me included) have thought about transferring at some point early in our college careers. It\u2019s definitely going to be an adjustment wherever you go, but I think most people end up really finding their fit or niche wherever at whatever college they\u2019re at. I would definitely give it some time and try to explore BU to the best of your ability before thinking about transferring a year or two in. Also, if your scholarship is important to you, just be aware that most LACs (Amherst included) don\u2019t give academic scholarships, but give really generous financial aid instead. \n\nAlso, didn\u2019t see that last part, but I wouldn\u2019t think that transferring from an engineering program at a large school would impact transfer decisions at all.",

So I can probably give you some advice but since I wasn\u2019t a student at BU I\u2019m not sure I have the full feel of the place.\n\nAs for what to do: get a 4.0 and take all \u201cliberal arts\u201d classes, or at least something that would have an equivalent class at Amherst. I don\u2019t think you would get credit for \u201cEngineering 101\u201d when transferring, for example.\n\nBU is great if you like the city. Are you from Boston area? If you\u2019d prefer a smaller town/rural feel then you\u2019ll probably appreciate Amherst more. It seems like you can definitely \u201cget lost\u201d at BU given the scale of the place where you could have trouble making friends or feeling comfortable. I really like Boston now, but I can imagine feeling overwhelmed by it as a college freshman.\n\nAt Amherst your graduating class is so small you will probably know the faces of half your class, which is both good and bad. But it feels kind of neat to have those small connections. And the connections with faculty would be better too.\n\nIf you have other questions let me know.",

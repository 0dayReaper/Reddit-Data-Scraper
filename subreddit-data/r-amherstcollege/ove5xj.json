    "postText": "I toured a couple days ago and found myself a little worried? Amherst was always a top choice of mine but I got a little spooked by my tour. Long story short, it seemed to me based off of my tour guide that students really don\u2019t have any life outside of Amherst? When asked to describe what our tour guide did for fun, they talked about some writing clubs and made it seem they do ungodly amounts of work every day, amounting to no time to do anything related to fun. By fun, I don\u2019t mean debate club, just to be clear. Anyway, I was wondering if this impression I got was right, or if I just got unlucky on my tour, and in actuality plenty of students at Amherst have time to relax and recharge.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I think we play hard and work hard. That being said, a lot of students are overachievers and put a lot on their plates, hence seeming like Amherst is their entire life. \n\nPersonally, I prioritize my health and sanity so I always have time to go the gym everyday, hang out with friends, and attend sporting events. Although I don\u2019t know about that anymore considering I\u2019m writing a thesis next year and applying to graduate schools\u2026 \n\nTo end on a high note, if you can pace yourself, there is some many things to do for such a small town. Sporting events, affinity groups, cooking with your friends, talks from renowned professors, going to other schools and attending their events, getting coffee in town, exploring the bike trail/book and plow farm, going to Noho, Val sitting, and from your username, the Hillel group at Amherst is very close and tight knit, listening to the performances at Marsh house on Friday nights, seeing Gads Improv on Mondays, Jazz night at Schwemms on Thursday, Acapella performances, Fall fest, Winter fest, International Streets but the best moments are whatever you do with your friends so finding a good friend group makes everything doable.\n\nGood luck on your applications!",

            "comment": "With the tour guides being college employees and tours also with high school students and parents, thy probably can\u2019t say things like \u201cI get blasted on the weekends and throw vending machines out windows\u201d (which has happened). But plenty of students make time for fun and shenanigans on the weekends. There definitely is a lot of work to do during the week, but you\u2019re also going to be living right next to your friends 24/7 here, so there\u2019s always something to make happen. There are also a lot of events that are thrown by the school, and parties thrown by clubs/sports teams if you\u2019re into those kind of things. Personally my weekends usually consist of substance abuse with friends and playing games together, milling about campus looking for anything interesting, going to student club functions, or just looking at one another.",

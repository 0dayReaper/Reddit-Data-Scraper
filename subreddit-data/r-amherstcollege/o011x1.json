I took it the first semester of my first year and it was really what opened my eyes to the religion department and led to me being a religion major and choosing Andrew Dole as my advisor. I kinda chose the class on a whim to fill out my schedule, but I\u2019m so glad I ended up taking it. As someone that came into Amherst thinking I would be dead set on pure STEM, I\u2019d really recommend everyone take a class out of their comfort zone their first year.",

I ended up forming a very close relationship with my older adult and we still talk to this day! The class was super eye-opening and made me realize how disrespectful and discriminatory American culture is towards old people.",

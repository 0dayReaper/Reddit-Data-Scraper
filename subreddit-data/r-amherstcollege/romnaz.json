Within two weeks of first calling to schedule an appt with a therapist I: saw a therapist, saw a psychiatrist, approved academic accommodations with accessibility services, and started my first dose of medication (paid for by the awesome student health insurance). \n\nHonestly... I can't imagine how all of that could have been achieved faster. Amazing service. I really feel that Amherst cares. Maybe those articles u/Samurius linked were because the school was unprepared for the huge uptick of students seeking mental health services due to COVID; maybe since then, things have changed (?).",

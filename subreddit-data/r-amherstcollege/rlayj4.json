    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nFor Amherst College's writing supplement, I'm planning to submit one of the papers that I wrote for my US history course in 11th grade. The thing that I am unsure of right now is that we were supposed to write the essay on google docs and my document only has the content on it, not the grade that my teacher gave me. Is it okay to simply submit the essay as is or do I need to attach a screenshot of my google classroom assignment to show the AOs what I got for my \"graded paper?\" Thanks a ton!",

I think showing the grade / comments on it shows you are honest / transparent / values feedback (?). If there is a way to show comments made by the teacher that reflects you honestly, I think it would only benefit you.",

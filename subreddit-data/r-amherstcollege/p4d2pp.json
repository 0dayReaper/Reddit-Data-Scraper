    "postText": "Hello!\n\nIm a prospective student considering EDing to Amherst this fall. One of my desires for a college is that it has beautiful architecture and nice looking buildings. When looking at some of the online videos of the Amherst campus, though, the campus looks very spread out with not a lot to do and lacking the beautiful buildings present at other top colleges (besides the new science building). Is this true? What has your personal experience been with the Amherst campus, especially if you have had the chance to visit other colleges?",

            "comment": "Amherst is like a hodgepodge of different buildings from different times. You can really sense the history when walking from one part of campus like Johnson Chapel to the new Science Center but there\u2019s really no aesthetic cohesion. If that is a major selling point for you, I\u2019d advise against it. Nearly every \u201ctop\u201d school follows the same scheme. Really old and pretty quad, center of campus but as you walk out of it, it quickly turns into more modern architecture.\n\nWith that being said, I really like Chicago\u2019s Quad, UW has a cool library, Berkeley feels somewhat cohesive. \n\nCheck out this students pictures of Amherst, I think he does a great job of capturing the beautify of Amherst. \n[Here](https://instagram.com/henrytong_lingkongzhuying?utm_medium=copy_link)",

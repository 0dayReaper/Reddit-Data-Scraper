            "comment": "For me, I just remember being extremely uncomfortably hot for the first week, further exacerbated by the fact that my dorm was 200 years old and orobably had never even heard of air conditioning. My LEAP group was also really confusing as well, as I was not really sure why we were spending the night in sleeping bags on the floor of a church rather than in our beds that were a 5 minute walk away. The first week was really a haze though, it goes by super fast and its kind of overwhelming with all the orientation and acclimating going on as well as trying to also get to know everyone you meet. I was really confused for the most of the first week of being on campus, as college was kind of like a very strange summer camp. This kind of \u201csummer camp\u201d phase of being a first year is also a great time to make friends! Your classmates will all be looking for something to do, and you don\u2019t have any schoolwork or extracurricular obligations just yet! \n\nMy biggest tip to the new students would be to not go too crazy at your first party on campus! It happens almost every year where new students will go a little too hard on their first outing and end up doing something very regrettable or end up at the ER getting their stomach pumped. Campus is small and you don\u2019t want to be \u201cthat person\u201d on your first week!",

            "comment": "* I was in the Yoga LEAP trip because I wanted to do something easy but I would not recommend it. If I could, I would force myself to do something more difficult that made me uncomfortable. First week was terribly humid, I think I had to shower three times every day because I was just dripping sweat. \n* I'm not sure if orientation week is the same this year as it is usually but if it is, there are so many events jam packed and I want to let you know its okay to tell your Orientation Leader that you are overwhelmed and exhausted from participating and just not go (or don't tell them and just dip).\n* Take advantage of the first few weeks and make as many friends or say hi to as many people as possible. People are the most willing and open at this point and it feels way harder later into the school year. \n* Get a job quick (especially one where you can sit on your butt)! Go to the job fair or network with upper class men. If you meet me in person and we get to know each other, I can reach out to my supervisors / departments to see if there are any jobs available.\n* Do not sign up for every club at the club fair, you will not attend any of them and eventually have to end up emailing them to take you off the listserv.\n* Do not take an 8 AM class your fall semester. Really feel it out and see if you can do it but these are the most draining. Similarly, do not take a 3 hour long once a week class your first semester. Those are so draining (imo). Incidentally, those 3 hour classes are usually from 2-5 so you end at 5PM, holy moly nty.\n* Mattress Topper / Fan / Shower Shoes \n* Most importantly, have fun and relax a bit! You guys earned it :\\]",

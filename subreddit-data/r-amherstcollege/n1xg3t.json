    "postText": "Welcome everyone to the subreddit for Amherst College! \n\nMy friend (u/Grimes\\_fanboy) and I are your newest mods here.\n\nA quick intro: I'm a Junior, double Major in Maths and Stats. I'm from the West Coast but was drawn to Amherst for its open curriculum and emphasis on learning. I'm currently studying remote but on campus I'm usually Val-Sitting or cooking in the Greenway Kitchens.\n\nThis subreddit has mostly ran on its own accord but as current Amherst College students and active participants in this subreddit, we figured we could facilitate livelier discussions and manage this subreddit .\n\nPersonally, I've never modded before so bear with me as I navigate this new responsibility. Any feedback or things you'd like to see from this subreddit, shoot me or u/Grimes_fanboy a dm.",

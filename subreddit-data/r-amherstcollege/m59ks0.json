My teammates and I are in the process of designing a sound-based digital coworking platform and we're looking to get feedback from a few undergrads and graduate students who have experience with frequenting public places with other people around (campus library, Starbucks, local coffeeshops, etc.) to study or do work before the pandemic.\n\nThe interview will be conducted remotely through BlueJeans, and should take anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes. If you're interested in participating in this study, please fill out this 30-second eligibility survey: [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_5748ix0M9NZd5yK](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5748ix0M9NZd5yK). You'd really help our research, and we'd love to hear your thoughts!",

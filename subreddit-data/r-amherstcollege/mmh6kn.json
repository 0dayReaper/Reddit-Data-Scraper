            "comment": "The train you want is Amtrak's Vermonter, it can be taken daily from New York Penn Station to Northampton Union Station without changing trains. It's considerably more comfortable than the bus, I'd regularly take it from Amherst before they rerouted the train through Northampton after upgrades. You can can also catch any train to New Haven Union Station (Metro North or Amtrak) and change trains to Amtrak's Valley Flyer which departs multiple times daily.\n\nYou can take PVTA or Uber from Northampton Union to get to Amherst College.\n\nhttps://www.amtrak.com/vermonter-train\n\nhttps://www.amtrak.com/valley-flyer-train\n\nIt should be noted that Vermonter is suspended for the moment due to COVID service cuts on Amtrak. Service should be restored once immunizations curb the spread of the virus and travel picks up.",

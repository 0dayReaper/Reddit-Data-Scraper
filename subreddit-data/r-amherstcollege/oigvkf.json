            "comment": "My first friend at Amherst was my RC (now known as a CA I think) funny enough. She made everyone on our floor feel really welcomed and built a really great community with our floor, so lots of my friends were also my first-year floor mates. My closest friends, however, came from going to club meetings. I think its kinda a rite of passage for first-years to sign up for way too many clubs initially, so I kinda realized that this one group of kids were in all the clubs I had signed up for as well. We really bonded when I kicked all they asses at chess club, but pretty soon we were kinda inseparable. So my advice for incoming students would be to acquaint yourself with your floor mates early in the first month before the whole \"why are you now being so friendly when you've been avoiding eye contact for the last month\" period sets in, and to join clubs! Personally, I got to know my floor pretty quickly by just hanging out in the common area of my floor a whole bunch. Going to club meetings and then getting food with your new club mates at val is also a great way to get to know people better, and if you don't know what to talk about, just complain about the food!",

I've also made friends from clubs like my affinity club and a club sports team. I also have some friends that I've initially met at parties but solidified our friendships through meals, classes, etc.",

I went to Summer Bridge which is a program for FLI students to get acclimated to college before college and I made many of my friends there. If you are going to Bridge, it will be one of your best moments in college. \n\nEveryone is desperate to make friends early on so take advantage of that desperation and befriend people. I feel like it is harder to make friends later on. \n\nAlso, make friends with people in your same major. If its something like Psych or Econ, it might be harder but if you're in Religion or English or Classics, being friends with each other and seeing each other grow is an amazing feeling.",

Psych (I can\u2019t personally speak for Econ) tends to be a bit more lecture based while having larger class sizes, but religion/English/classics tend to have much smaller class sizes while also being more discussion based. However, I have found that most of my major friends have come from discussion/lab sections of STEM classes, so there\u2019s always opportunity to meet people through classes.",

With smaller majors, I feel like that sense of solidarity is built in while with bigger ones, you can find that solidarity through labs / professors",

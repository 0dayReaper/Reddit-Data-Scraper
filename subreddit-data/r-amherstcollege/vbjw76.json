            "comment": "Yup, like what Bob said, Java is used mainly for CS I, CS II, and Data Structures (three of the necessary requirements for a CS major). Electives such as AI use Python, and Computer Systems uses Assembly languages.\n\nIn terms of preparing ahead, I would actually say not to stress too much about it if you end up in CS I. Comp Sci I is a really accessible course that is catered to those who have no coding experience, so you'll definitely pick up the language anyways.\n\nComp Sci II also typically has a month or so of review as well (depending on the prof you get), though since CS II focuses on Inheritance and Object-Oriented stuff, it's best to have a firm grip on the basics of coding (loops, if-statements, data types, arrays).",

    "postText": "With over half of Massachusetts being vaccinated and staff + students being required to get vaccinated before getting to campus, how do you all think campus will look in the fall? I am ridiculously excited to get to school, and I\u2019m hoping to have as normal of an experience as humanly possible. Since you don\u2019t need masks when you\u2019re in vaccinated groups/when you\u2019re outdoors, I\u2019m wondering if masks will still be mandated. Of course nobody can know for sure but I\u2019m hoping things will be pretty much back to normal. I\u2019m sure classes will be in person, and I know Val\u2019s already opening up, but outside of that, what are everyone\u2019s thoughts? Will weekly testing still be a thing, for example?",

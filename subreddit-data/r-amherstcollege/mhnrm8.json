    "postText": "Hello all! \n\nI\u2019m still so excited that I got accepted. However, yesterday, I saw my aid award and it was way more than I thought and my parents won\u2019t be able to pay. \n\nI\u2019m currently in the process of appealing my financial aid and drafting a letter. I was wondering if anyone has had any luck with appealing their financial aid before? I\u2019m really worried I won\u2019t be able to attend because Amherst is my dream school :(\n\nThank you so much for any help! :)",

            "comment": "There are two main ways to tackle the appeal:  \n\n\n1. is there something that happened AFTER your parents' tax year that drastically affects how they could pay for college (laid off, less work, recent medical expenses)? Because FAFSA only looks at tax years and that's based off of 2019, if there was something that happened in the past two years that affects how you could afford college its worth bringing it to the financial aid's attention\n2. Do other (similar) colleges that you have been accepted to have better financial aid packages? For example, if Amherst is making you pay $10 for tuition but Williams (or other similar liberal arts school) is making you pay $5, you can try to mention that. Something along the lines of \"I really love Amherst, but finances are an important part of my final decision and other schools have more competitive financial aid packages.\"  \n\n\nDoing an appeal does not mean that you'll get a better financial aid package. Be prepared to have the financial aid office tell you that they can't give you more. Make sure to really stress that the only thing holding you back is the money.   \n\n\ni wish you the best of luck!",

I also got accepted into Colby, Hamilton, and Bowdoin and they\u2019ve all given better financial aid offers, so I was planning to include that.\n\nI really will make sure to stress that finances are the only thing that\u2019s holding me back in my letter, once again, thank you so much for this advice!",

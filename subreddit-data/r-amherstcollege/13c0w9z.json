    "postText": "hi, would appreciate thoughts about the amherst social/academic scene as i'm considering transfer. \n\n1. what's social life like? what do people do for fun? do people spend a good deal of time with their friends?\n2. what's the academic culture like? is there a lot of discussion in classes? do students like the classes (humanities)? \n3. are there clubs for creative pursuits?\n4. is it easy to talk about ideas/things you care about with friends?",

            "comment": "1. yes a good deal of time w/friends. People do a variety of things, i dont think it's a super party school but there are some. Pick-up games, eating out, watching performances, board games, video games,...\n2. Usually a fair amount of discussion, cuz classes are small. I think it depends on the student whether they'll like classes or not but in general you kinda get what you put into it for humanities classes imo\n3. yes\n4. yes",

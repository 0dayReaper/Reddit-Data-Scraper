    "postText": "Hey all! I'm a student at a university in Boston, but I am living at home in Northampton because of COVID. I've recently started development (along with a partner) of an app startup, and we're looking for student developers who would be interested in joining (for equity)!\n\nWe're looking for someone with experience in, or a willingness to learn as they go:\n\n* React Native\n* MongoDB and MySQL\n* Node.js, or other serverside frameworks\n* Experience using APIs in mobile applications\n\nAdditionally, if you're not a student but are still interested in joining, reach out!\n\nPlease PM me with questions or inquiries. I've kept this brief as I am interested in meeting the kind of people who are interested in work like this for potential future partners regardless of whether or not you're interested in this project specifically.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you!",

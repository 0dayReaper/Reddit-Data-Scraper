    "postText": "I'm an international junior who is kinda falling in love with Amherst, but still has my doubts about applying ED. My intended major is econ, I've got decent stats(1590 on the SAT, 95%+ my whole life) and good enough ECs I guess?([https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/nyro4a/chances\\_for\\_economics\\_international\\_student/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/nyro4a/chances_for_economics_international_student/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) \\-more details)  \nAmherst is one of my top choices because:  \n1. It's need-blind   \n2. Has great graduate placement  \n3. I like the idea of a small school where you can form deeper relationships with everyone, and everyone seems to be sharing anecdotes of how close the students are with each other and the professors  \n4. No grad students, so no TAs and better research+ internship opportunities  \n\n\nBut I'd like to have a balanced viewpoint before I make the decision to apply ED(Plus there's always the \"what if by some crazy stroke of luck, I get into like, Harvard or something? Will I regret my decision then?\"). Applying ED would probably boost my odds significantly(I've been told they fill a third of their class with ED), but still. What do you think are the absolute worst things about amherst which I need to keep in mind before making a decision?",

But yeah, the fact that it's ED is what makes me doubtful. Because if I got into like, Harvard or something by some stroke of luck, then I might regret it? Are you an Amherst student? What do you think of the college?",

    "postText": "A  group of us from The Surreal Times newspaper meet on Thursdays downtown Amherst to hangout, play surrealist games, brainstorm and  collaborate. We report on news sourced from reality as well as the broader Sir Reality, telling stories of what happens in the objective world as well as in non-ordinary realms\n\nWe are looking for more people to collaborate with! Please message me or email [editors@surrealtimes.net](mailto:editors@surrealtimes.net) if you're interested in getting involved.\n\nNote:  If you haven't heard of us, you can get a copy of our newspaper from  our distribution boxes downtown. We have one in front of Amherst Books  and one in front of The Works.\n\nBest wishes!\n\nKeep it surreal",

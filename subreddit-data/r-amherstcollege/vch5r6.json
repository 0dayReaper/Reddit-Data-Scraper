The beautiful thing about Amherst is that they support you in whatever ambitions you have. If you want to perform and be heard, then you can ask for money / support from the school to host your own event and get speakers / other students to participate as well. A con of this sort of openness is that its really on the student to initiate events and get things rolling.",

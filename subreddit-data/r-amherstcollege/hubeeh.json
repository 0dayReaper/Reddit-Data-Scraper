    "postText": "Hi, as the title says I'm an incoming freshmen, and I'm thinking of majoring in history or biology. My interest weighs heavily towards history - I love history. I have questions for current students who have taken history classes. How does a history course at Amherst compare to a class like AP American history or AP European history? To what extent did your writing abilities improve by taking a history course? Who is your favorite history professor? What freshmen seminar would you recommend? I've heard that the one about lies behind politics is amazing. I looked at the list, and the one about the Enlightenment and Romanticism looked very interesting.\n\nAlso, I've heard it's pretty essential to get involved in a sport because the social life revolves around that. Is that true? \n\nPS - other incoming students PM me!",

However, as a bio/psych major, I can tell you that the biology department is fantastic, and completing both a history and biology major would be entirely realistic. \n\nYou don't need to be involved with sports for a social life. Are you coming to campus this semester? It is going to be weird.",

            "comment": "I know I\u2019m the second person to not really be involved in history to respond to this, so I hope it\u2019s at least a bit useful.\n\nI did take a History or Sexuality course in SWAGS, and I thought that it was pretty interesting. Some of the writing got scrapped towards the end because of everything that went on, but I think between that and the intro to SWAGS course my writing definitely improved. The writing center definitely helps with that (at one point in first semester I was going twice a week lol).\n\nAs for first year seminars, Secrets and Lies taught by Sarat was a great course. He\u2019s an LJST professor who focuses a lot on the death penalty, and the course is mainly about politics and morality, so there\u2019s a lot of political history. I took AP Gov in high school, but this course definitely made me think a lot more. Sarat likes to cold-call people, and he always posed a moral question at the beginning of class that we would spend the whole time discussing. \n\nThe rumor about sports is because sports teams tend to hang around each other a lot since they practice so much. I\u2019m involved in club sports, but most of my friends are not. It\u2019s useful to get involved with at least some clubs (sports or not) in order to meet new people, but if you don\u2019t like sports you\u2019ll be fine :)\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Hi, I\u2019m an American Studies major who takes many classes in History and is applying to grad school for History! I also took AP Euro and AP US.\n\nI love love love every History class I\u2019ve taken, and my favorite professors are Professor Franklin Odo and Professor George Qiao. They\u2019re both very smart people, with degrees from Princeton and Stanford, and Professor Odo is even a founding member of the field of Asian American History and an original Asian American Civil Rights Movement activist! Both of them are so very caring and understanding and will take time out of their days to meet with you.\n\nHistory classes I\u2019ve taken are usually quite small (between 5 and 20 people, smaller as the level increases) and I would say there is much more discussion and nuance than AP classes. I would say the reading is greater in volume than AP classes, but it is much more dynamic and interesting, and some teachers will encourage you to skim the reading because it is intended to lay groundwork/context for any essays you will write (you may write 3/4 short essays or two large essays or be required to make one large final project depending on the teacher). It\u2019s totally ok if you miss a reading here or there because, again, it\u2019s meant to lay groundwork for class discussions and lectures (lectures are very important for classes with multiple choice tests, which is mainly the foundation classes!!).\n\nUnlike AP classes which involve a lot of rote memorization, Amherst History classes stress critical thinking and analysis and discussion using this information rather than hard memorization of facts (you don\u2019t need to stress about memorizing super exact dates like in AP, but you will need to interpret the ideas you\u2019ve learned and conduct some extent of original research depending on the difficulty of the class).\n\nAs for writing skills, I would say, yes, the intro history classes probably will improve them quite a bit. They also encourage you to meet with the writing center before essays.",

            "comment": "Also, I disagree with the sports thing hahahah. I don\u2019t have any close friends involved in a sport and we all have good social lives. You can get than by being involved in an affinity group or a language club or a music group (chorus, orchestra, etc) or theater or just having friends in general. I have my close group of friends that I  met initially in various classes or orientation and I also have \u201cgroups\u201d from an affinity group and chorus. I would actually say that you don\u2019t need to be involved in any clubs at all to have an active social life, because Amherst classes are very small and often involve team projects, and most of my close friends I met while working closely with in class.",

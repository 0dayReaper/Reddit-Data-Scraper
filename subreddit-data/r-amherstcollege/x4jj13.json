            "comment": "Graduated in 2017, so things might have changed since my day.\n\nDepends on what you want. If you want a city experience with concerts &amp; loads of different restaurants, then Amherst being in the middle of nowhere is probably the worst thing about it. I knew it would be like that going in, and I was fine with it. Many of my classmates disliked that, though. \n\nOn a superficial level, walking on all those hills is not enjoyable, and it sucks that there\u2019s only 1 dining hall. The lines can be really bad for that.\n\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t love how (white) athlete heavy the student body was. I went in thinking it would be loads of quirky nerds since it\u2019s a small school in the middle of nowhere, but I think like 1/3 of the student body was athletes. It wasn\u2019t a huge deal. I was able to find my people there, and I feel like everyone can. It was just a little disappointing to me that that was such a prevalent part of the social scene. There was some gathering of football boys in one of the dorms going crazy celebrating Trump\u2019s win in 2016. One of the black lacrosse players experienced very explicit racism from his white teammates a few years ago that you can probably read about somewhere online. Most of the athletes weren\u2019t like that. In fact, some of my closest friends were athletes. It\u2019s just that in general I steered clear of the athlete portion of the student body.\n\nThinking back on it, it wasn\u2019t even just the athletes. There was also a white preppy New England culture that I wasn\u2019t used to coming from Missouri. Think Sperry\u2019s, salmon shorts, long sleeve button up, spends summers with parents at Martha\u2019s Vineyard. One such guy once got drunk and told a classmate of color that scholarship students should shut up about problematic stuff on campus and be grateful bc he funds their education. Back in 2015 during the Amherst Uprising (protests about racial disparities at the college), some anonymous butthurt conservative put up posters saying \u201cRIP free speech.\u201d\n\nAll that being said, I did appreciate the solidarity amongst the POC at Amherst. The Black Student Union was really tight knit. I\u2019m half Taiwanese, and I experienced more Asian solidarity at Amherst than I ever had at home. The diversity was something I will always cherish about my time there.\n\nSorry that was so stream of consciousness. I hope it helped.",

Many athletes only academically qualify because they do a fifth year of high school to get grades up. Football players are allowed to act like assholes and behave terribly toward women. The school has known about it for decades and does nothing to fix it. By the time I left, pretty much every woman on campus hated the places.",

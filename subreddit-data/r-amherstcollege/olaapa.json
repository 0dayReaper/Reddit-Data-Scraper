            "comment": "I can't fully answer the first question because I've never actually skated at Amherst, but there is a rink and if you bring skates, you'll be able to skate there (probably during hockey's offseason? idrk though). There is also an event in the winter called winter fest where the college supplies students with skates so they can skate with their friends and also enjoy some hot cider and donuts.\n\nAs for the climbing gym, there's a Central Rock Gym pretty close and the outing club usually makes trips a couple of times a week (really, it's whenever people with cars want to go). If you go with the outing club, they pay for all your fees so you can climb and rent shoes for free! Highly recommend also joining the climbing team. They used to have regular practices and are generally a very welcoming group. Nobody really knows how things will look this semester as basically every club on campus came to a halt over the last year and a half, but there are some active climbers around (including me!) so I'm sure there'll be a decent amount of trips happening throughout the semester. Feel free to reply or DM me if you want to know more :)",

Some student orgs do trips to the UMass rink during the year and they'll cover all the fees\n\nthere's interest in starting a skating club on campus to cover skate costs so if that pans out that will be an option too :) welcome to amherst!",

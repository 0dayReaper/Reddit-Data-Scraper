    "postText": "Hey guys! Does anyone know if it's possible to appeal. They expect me to pay 3.4k a year... it says I can do work-study for 2.4k a year but like idk.... that's still a lot of money compared to what other schools are offering me. I thought it was a full ride at first and then I saw these numbers and was like OH-",

            "comment": "hmm, 3.4k a year is not bad? you will practically have no debt when you graduate assuming you do the work study. also if you work two weeks during commencement reunion, you make like a grand. If other schools are offering you better deals and they're better schools, go to that one instead.\n\nIf you work 10hours a week and get paid avg 13 and you work like 30 weeks, thats already 4k. and 10 hours is extremely doable. most jobs just let you sit and do your homework. this is coming from a fli student who normally juggles 20 hours of work from ubering / grading / research / IT which all are super lax and chill.\n\nbut im not answering you question tho, i think there's another post that has a great answer so check that one out",

            "comment": "You can shoot your shot and appeal. Make sure to stress to financial aid how much you want to go but the money is holding you back and other schools have better offers. However it\u2019s not full-proof. \n\nIf they offered you 2.4k in work study, that means you\u2019ll be prioritized in almost every campus job. And if they pay minimum wage (in MA that\u2019s 13.50) that means at minimum you need to work 6 hrs a week. I\u2019ve had friends in work study jobs and they usually took more hours because they got to pocket the rest. \n\nIf you choose to take the work study (i would 100% recommend) then you\u2019d end up only having to find a way to get 1k. \n\nOf course, if other schools are giving you better options without working, then that\u2019s a fair consideration. I always tell students that I work with that you should pick the school that you feel most comfortable with (both financially and as a future home).",

That all expenses are being considered fairly.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure I understand your circumstance specifically.  Did they offer you a mix of merit based and needs based support or is it needs based and you are trying to close the gap?  If the award was merit based and you appeal for financial aid you are going to have to pull together a fair bit of documentation to show a change in circumstance between the last submitted tax year and now.",

            "comment": "Hey, i'm a little late to respond but I went to Amherst and successfully appealed financial aid a handful of years back. Not sure if your offer was based on your parents' income or not, but mine was not.\n\nI can't remember how it went down exactly but basically I told them the truth about my situation - that whatever financial info they used to make the offer wouldn't paint an accurate picture of what my income would look like while I would be enrolled. \n\nI worked full time while attending a community college before transferring to Amherst, and told them that I couldn't succeed while commuting/working so often, and that I really thought I'd need additional financial support. \n\nI think from there I filled out some forms and met with a financial aid dean a few times. The guy was actually really nice. In the end it really worked out in my favor to try. \n\nI hope that helps. Good luck.",

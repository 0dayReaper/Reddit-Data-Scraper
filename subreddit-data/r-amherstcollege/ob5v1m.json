The nice thing about single gender floors is you can use any of the bathrooms, so you can just move if one is full. Otherwise though I didn't see much difference.",

Everybody switched rooms/dorms between semesters bc the rules changed about who was allowed on campus. I think usually your dorm is yours for the whole year unless you're having an issue with accessibility or a roommate or something.",

Otherwise, change of scenery and to room with different friends. Also certain dorms may be more common for parties or studying, and you may want to live in or close to that environment.",

You can go in through the side where people are coming out, and you probably won't be noticed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest option though would be to go to the bathroom (opposite end of where the dining hall is, when you enter the building). Then leaving the bathroom just walk right past the line of people waiting to swipe in. Since the only bathroom is outside the dining area, they'll assume you swiped in before.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am an international student planning to apply to Amherst College next year. My family has a low income and I am too worried about my uni apps, cuz this year a university in Europe cancelled my scholarship due to the Ukr-Rus war and gave all the possible scholarships to the war refugees and this made me stressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am interested, do I have even a chance to get into Amherst. Also, this sibling will apply for unis this next year too, does Amherst even accept 2 students from one family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy cgpa is 4.5 over 5.\n\nMy IELTS score is 7.5.\n\nExtracurriculars: 4 times national and international level hackathons. I have organized one of the biggest hackathons in my country with the support of the European Commission. participated in the Harvard research conference and won an innovation challenge. Have a research paper about physic. I have some related courses &amp; job certificates in the ethical hacking field. Have programming projects and currently developing a game. Youtube channel where I share hacking tutorials etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks before for replying.",

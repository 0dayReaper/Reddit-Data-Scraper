    "postText": "Hi! Can any current or former Amherst students talk about their academic experience at the school. How would you describe the academic difficulty of Amherst? Is it hard to make A grades? How does Amherst compare to your high school experience in terms of academics and what was that high school experience like? Do the Professors actually want you to succeed as much as they say? Can I have a healthy social life while balancing academics.\n\nI\u2019d be particular interested in the difficulty of pre med reqs like bio, chem, calc, and physics. And, any info on the LJST program would be much appreciated!!",

            "comment": "Hi there, alumnus and current medical student here! I would say that classes at Amherst are certainly a step up from my HS (a fairly rigorous, small school with many seminar classes) but that in my experience the professors genuinely want students to succeed and are more than willing to work with students both in and outside of class to clarify points and work through difficulties. That was true of my science and humanities professors and, perhaps most importantly, my peers. For me, I never felt that it was unclear what I needed to do to get an A and I was able to be reasonably successful in that while having a very healthy social life and being heavily involved with several organizations.\n\nAs far as premed classes go, I would really lean on Dean Aronson (the premed advisor who is GREAT) and your academic advisor to offer some guidance on what would be reasonable timelines to complete those requirements and other classes that might look good to medical school adcoms (e.g. Medical Anthropology). Upperclassmen can also be helpful when selecting which professors you want to have for different classes. I was a biophysics major (BCBP) which I think is a great program for premed students if you're interested in exploring a bunch of different fields, though I know many people who are now in med school who majored in everything from biology to art history to LJST; the lack of distribution requirements is a huge boon to your ability to complete both programs. Let me know if you have any more questions and best of luck deciding!",

            "comment": "Grade inflation go brrrrrrr!!,!  But my friend says we have grade deflation idk but premed is very hard track regardless of where u go, I will say Amherst and schools similar to Amherst have the resources to help u succeed so don\u2019t sweat grades. Grades mean more in high school so I understand your question and I guess grades matter at Amherst too for premed but I think the prestige of Amherst goes a long way as well. Umm final thoughts, Amherst is fine not too will not only survive but succeed! And ur grade is never a reflection of who u r !",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your response! I\u2019ve already applied ED so I\u2019m locked in if I get in, I think Amherst is a good choice from the research I\u2019ve done and the people I\u2019ve talked to, but I\u2019ve always questioned what the difficulty may be like at college, especially at a school like Amherst. I\u2019ve taken many AP classes and one dual enrollment, but the difficulty of those vary by school and I would assume Amherst would be challenging because of its reputation. I have strong scores and I think I\u2019m academically capable but I have no clue what to expect and I want to keep a reasonably high gpa. I am interested in LJST. Would you happen to know how the \u201cweeding out\u201d  is conducted in a class like Legal Questions. In classes that you take, is it homework every night or do you think you have less assignments than you did in high school?",

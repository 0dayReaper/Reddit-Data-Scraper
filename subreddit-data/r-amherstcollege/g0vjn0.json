I wanted to hear from students about their thoughts on the school and what you like about it etc.\n\nSo I guess, you can tell me stuff about like:\n\nWhat are other students like at Amherst? Are they friendly or super competitive? I heard at prestigious schools that it tends to be cutthroat and students compete with each other on how many hours of sleep they didn't get and compare themselves with others, though so far I don't get that kind of vibe strongly from Amherst.\n\nWhat do you think about the professors here? Do you like their instruction style?\n\nWhat's the campus like?\n\nWhat's your major?\n\nWhat kind of personality do you think is suited for Amherst/ or is there a common type of student / or mostly diverse? (like are a lot of kids here super math-y, or are more students tending to be artsy/ into humanities? Do students tend to be serious or more fun-loving and perhaps party-goers?)\n\nAnd anything else you like about Amherst.\n\nI'd love to hear about it! Thanks!",

            "comment": "Rising junior majoring in Statistics at Amherst here:\n\nWhat are other students like at Amherst? Are they friendly or super competitive? I heard at prestigious schools that it tends to be cutthroat and students compete with each other on how many hours of sleep they didn't get and compare themselves with others, though so far I don't get that kind of vibe strongly from Amherst.\n\nANSWER: \n\nAmherst is so small, it fosters a collaborative environment. There's no advantage in being cutthroat. Students are for the most part friendly / chill. Like at any school, kids will be deprived of sleep. No difference at Amherst.\n\nWhat do you think about the professors here? Do you like their instruction style?\n\nANSWER: \n\nProfessors are very friendly, want you to learn. With that said, the number one priority is the students' education at any liberal arts college / small college.\n\nInstruction styles vary widely but in a generalized manner, humanities are usually seminar/discussion and are small (&lt;15 people). Lectures for introduction / bigger classes. STEM classes are bigger but it varies (I'm in an upper-level stat class with only 12 people while my lower-level Data Structures class has 40 in one section).  As a Statistics Major, we are constantly doing group projects. Not my cup of tea....\n\nWhat's the campus like?\n\nANSWER: \n\nBeautiful for like 1/5 of the year to be honest. It's the Northeast so winters can be brutal although this year, it wasn't quite bad. But unique to Amherst, it's a small and quaint campus. There is a good spectrum of old to new buildings. Very hill-y so be prepared to work out your calves.\n\nWhat's your major?\n\nANSWER: \n\nStatistics Major!!!\n\nWhat kind of personality do you think is suited for Amherst/ or is there a common type of student / or mostly diverse? (like are a lot of kids here super math-y, or are more students tending to be artsy/ into humanities? Do students tend to be serious or more fun-loving and perhaps party-goers?)\n\nANSWER: \n\nI think if you want to become more well-rounded, learn how to think critically, engage in meaningful and deep conversations, willing to be in a small community. There is a good mix although more and more are STEM majors. The open curriculum allows for a lot of crossover and exploration so while I'm Stats, I've taken courses from the American Studies and PoliSci and Enviro Studies department (but it is up to you to explore). Then again, it would be a reductive statement to generalize all STEM majors as geeks and Humanities Majors as liberal snowflakes. Amherst is very diverse for such a small school so ! I feel like most students here are chill or perhaps that is the crowd that I associate myself with. People grind during the week and party on the weekends. \n\nAnd anything else you like about Amherst.\n\nANSWER: \n\nNo frats, so parties are open for everyone. \n\nExtracurricular Clubs are open to everyone, once again, small college, having an application process would be unsound.\n\nTiny rural town, not for everyone. There's like 3 boba places within a block of each other though... UMASS right next door. Amherst can feel like an ivory tower sometimes but that is what you make of it.\n\nAmherst's per-student spending is like literally insane, look up the statistics. In my example, I've been able to travel to multiple conferences across the US, travel to a different country, and visit NYC/Boston for free. Amherst's devotion to the student on the financial side is par excellence, although I'm suspect this is to make up for some inadequacies in other non-financial resources.\n\nPeople speak of the athlete/non-athlete divide but it's only prevalent due to how small our school is. It's not really a big issue unless it translates to shitty things being done like the Men's lacrosse team this semester. Athletes spend all their time with their teammates so of course they will be friends and hang out with them. It's more natural tendencies rather than a structural issue. I have friends that play a sport and they are all super nice. Once again, it is a small school, you really can't be mean without it coming back to bite you in the ass.",

            "comment": "Rising Sophomore, on a neuro/premed track and potentially double majoring in psych\n\nI have to say, students at Amherst tend to just be nice. I've never really encountered the cutthroat atmosphere here, and we all complain about a lack of sleep (usually STEM majors but coursework is rigorous across the board. I think STEM classes just have worse hours). I did come from a competitive high school and I've heard of similar things at Harvard and other places, but not here. I've only ever had positive responses to asking for help or getting to know people. \n\nThe professors are great, can't say much about their style because that's very individualized. I will say that the focus is definitely on the students, the size is fantastic because of that. In my largest class (I think one of the largest in general) of 80 or so students (prob a little less) I still feel like the professors really care, and most of them get to know all students by name.\n\nCampus is beautiful, everything is within walking distance that you could possibly need, by your second year you might start feeling a bit cramped but there's free public transportation, and you're also allowed to bring a car starting sophomore year. I love the outdoors, and the area is great for exploring and hiking. \n\nThe diversity of the student body continually surprises me, there's not really any one 'type' that fits on campus, and I think that's great. I have heard frequent complaints about the social life, and I didn't have much in high school so I'm happy but it definitely doesn't hold a candle to other large schools, even UMASS down the road. I think the school is kinda in a party recession after the party dorms were torn down a while back, hopefully things will get better again but unless social life is a must for you it's not too bad. \n\nThe athlete/non-athlete divide is significant, it kinda comes from the small size. In general, what you do on campus (sport, club, etc.) tends to define you. It's the one thing I dislike, because you don't have quite as much freedom to be yourself as you'd expect. Not to mention (as was mentioned by someone else) if you're a complete dick to people, it'll get around quick. Generally, you at least recognize by face the majority of people on campus, which is a blessing or a curse depending on how you life your life. \n\nBesides this, all the students I've met love getting to know others, and that includes all the weird or quirky things you might enjoy. Everyone's just figuring themselves out, and even if it's small we're all just exploring and being super open-minded.\n\nAll in all, I love Amherst and I can't imagine being anywhere else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.\n\nFuck Williams",

They\u2019re usually either one above or one below us on the college ranking charts, and they\u2019re both similar size. I will say the Williams campus isn\u2019t quite as pretty (trying to say that unbiased), and if u thought Amherst was isolated, Williams is practically on its own planet. I drove up there for a rugby match once, we were driving through the mountains for hours before getting there, and as far as I could tell they didn\u2019t have any restaurants or fast food chains or anything like that up there. Also, we won. You\u2019d rly have to ask around more for details, but just ab everyone I know says they\u2019re similar in most other aspects. Except, of course, we\u2019re better. (PS we also have the five college consortium, and I don\u2019t think they gave any equivalent.",

We all share our libraries, wifi network, you can take classes at any consortium college (most of us go to UMass if anywhere), and students attend events at consortium colleges, because they're relatively close together. The 5 colleges are Amherst, Smith, Hampshire (which I believe is closing down, actually), Holyoke, and University of Massachusetts. I know many students here take certain UMass courses because they're easier (these are usually non-required courses however) and if you finagle your schedule right, you can get a voucher to eat at UMass's dining hall (one of the best in the nation).",

I know I was worried going in, because I tend to get a bit socially anxious, but everyone was in the same boat and that definitely helped. Just don\u2019t be afraid to talk to random people! Tbh I\u2019ve not seen much of any competitiveness at Amherst. Everyone has been happy to help me with stuff I don\u2019t understand, and I know I\u2019ve helped other people with homework when I understand it better. I would say they\u2019re definitely not cutthroat like that lol. Actually, I know that at least in my friend group, we tend to push each other to take care of ourselves a bit better. I know they\u2019ve definitely convinced me to take breaks whenever I got super stressed. Tbh, id say although I\u2019m sure competitive people exist, it\u2019s easy enough to become friends with the kinds of people you want to be friends with, so you should be good!\n\nProfessors:\nI love the professors. All of the professors I\u2019ve had have been really supportive and understanding, and while I\u2019ve disliked material and style I\u2019ve never disliked them. Sometimes classes are more lecture heavy, especially for intro classes, and I get kind of bored during lectures tbh. But, gathered are also a lot of smaller, non-lecture classes, and I love those. I\u2019ve been in a couple of smaller, discussion based classes, and they\u2019ve all been interesting and engaging.\n\nCampus:\nThe campus is fairly small, but imo beautiful. It\u2019s fairly hilly, which is kinda annoying lol. The buildings are fairly spread out, which means sometimes you have to run to make it to class, but I also like the walking.\n\nMajor: \nI am a CS major, although I\u2019m thinking about doubling in SWAGS.\n\nPersonality:\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a common student in terms of math vs humanities or party vs not. Both are pretty common. I think you have to be open to new ideas and accepting of other minorities, because teachers will challenge your ideas and the campus has a diverse student body. For reference, I am fairly nerdy and definitely not a party goer, and I\u2019ve been fine. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask! Good luck!!",

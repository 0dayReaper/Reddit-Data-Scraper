I personally like going right before closing time since I have way too much energy at night, I don\u2019t enjoy lifting enough to do that a lot, mostly I just play pickup basketball or with club tennis if I want to work out. And I feel like there\u2019s almost always time for the gym, sometimes the hard part is actually being motivated enough to go. As far as times go, it\u2019s really whenever you feel like it. It gets a bit packed sometimes, but you\u2019ll usually always be able to find some machines or benches open. If you\u2019re just trying to avoid people at all costs, I\u2019d say 9-1 is probably peak dead hours if your schedule allows for it.",

            "comment": "The gym is divided into two levels, the lower level has free weights and is where the athletes usually work out at so avoid downstairs if you do not want to be perceived. Upstairs has the ellipticals, smith machines, and some dumbbells so stay on that level if you're more casual about the gym.\n\nI used to go every weekday but then only three times a week because you just get busy but I do not think its hard to balance. Just takes prioritization and dedication. I think the best time to go without being perceived is between 9-3. The athletes have morning and evening lifts so the best time is the afternoon imo.\n\nGood luck!",

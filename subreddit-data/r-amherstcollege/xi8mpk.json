    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently preparing my Amherst application, I'd love to know if the school offers a major in particular (other than CS! Not because I dislike coding, but because of competition) that would be particularly suitable for a career in quant finance (and the tech industry as a backup, SWE or managerial positions). I'd like a STEM undergrad, am planning to go to grad school, am good at math. ECs/student profile are also STEM oriented.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S. Any CS + X or interdisciplinary majors?",

It\u2019s a pretty good major to pair with anything else\u2014if not cs maybe econ to get some exposure to markets etc, but you def don\u2019t need Econ to go into finance. Our math major here is pretty interdisciplinary too.",

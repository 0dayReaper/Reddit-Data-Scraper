I think I saw somewhere that they have more graduate students than undergrad and I\u2019m applying to the teaching/multiple subjects credential. Just wanted to know if anyone knew or has had an experience! I\u2019ve heard it isn\u2019t that hard especially for an alum but I want validation hahaha",

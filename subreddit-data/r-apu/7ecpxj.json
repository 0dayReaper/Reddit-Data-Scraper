            "comment": "We want to invite students at APU to participate in the inaugural \u201cGreenhouse Initiative\u201d\u200b. For the first time, Sambazon and The Ecology Center are collaborating to help bring sustainability ideas and projects to life on college campuses where the Sambazon acai bowls are served. This opportunity is only being offered to APU and 13 other universities, so all ideas and proposals are strongly encouraged, no matter what stage of development they are in. To apply, students can submit a 3-minute video by December 3rd for the chance to receive up to a $4000 stipend from Sambazon and a Spring semester mentorship from our ecological experts from The Ecology Center. The money and mentorship will help the winning students reach their community and campus sustainability projects. Details of the program and how to apply can be found at theecologycenter.org/greenhouse",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm interested in applying to the Entry Level Master's of Science in Nursing Program at APU with a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (Primary Care) specialty. I was wondering if there's anyone in the program or has heard about it? What are your thoughts on the program? Does APU have a good nursing program? Do you feel well-prepared to be a nurse?\n\nI know that this program takes around 4-5 years to complete, since I would be working as an RN after the first 2 years. Do you think that's enough experience as an RN?",

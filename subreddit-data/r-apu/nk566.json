Now my classes are all ~100 student size.\n\nI took a bible class but somehow got it to transfer as a GE, pretty lucky. I didn't really plan out transferring as well as I should have. I come back to see all my friends, try to do it once a month or so, and it's much easier with my brother there.\n\n'98, do you still visit ever?",

    "postText": "Hey everyone hoping for some input . I don't wsnt another student to go through this.\nI was a student at the mft department at the Azusa campus. My first semester I got bullied by another student in the program. I'm not a push over either so I stand up for myself.  Given that it's grad school and my first semester  I tried to remain as polite as possible.  Eventually when the girl became extra disrespectful I asked her to stop and we raised our voice at each other. The students in the program ended up spreading rumors about me saying very mean things. The same semester a professor got upset because I didn't agree with how her TA graded my papers.  I had emailed him numerous times and no response so I looked for him in class and asked the professor if he read my emails. The professor said she didn't appreciate my attitude and went to go talk about me to the department chair. So did the girl who was bullying me around. Fast forward. I was placed at an internship where I experienced sexual harassment from a client and staff members (talking about body parts spreading rumors hostile enivotment etc). I reported them to the state and the defense that they are using against me is \"well her clinical director and department chair didn't like her either they said she was challenging student and is making a big deal out of this .\" Mind you I told my clinical director what was going on and they did nothing. For a period of time they ignored my emails. Fast forward to comps. I studied my butt off and passed but found out the class a year before me cheated (they used the iPhone messenger on their laptop), and that these students got alot of hours signed off they didn't do because their supervisors knew my clinical director.  This os ridiculous. I'm afraid if employers are calling the school and the school is speaking about me negatively (since they clearly have before). It would be hard to prove this but im bummed at this experience",

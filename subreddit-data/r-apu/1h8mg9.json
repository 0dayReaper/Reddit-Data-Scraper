You guys will need dishes and other kitchen \"essentials\" whatever you think that means. Then it's just furniture and household stuff. Toilet paper and cleaning supplies and stuff like pans or collandors if you want to cook. Make a list of everything you've used at your house this last week and remember to pack it or buy new ones. Also talk to your roommates about who is able to get major furniture cheaply! Hope this wasn't too late to be helpful. ",

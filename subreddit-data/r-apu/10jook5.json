    "postText": "Hi! so im not a student but i was wondering if anyone knew about this program they used to do (if they even still do it) Where one of the students would go to a middle school and hang with the same kid every week. They would take the kid out of class and stuff. \n\nAnyways i was wondering what that program was? i was a part of it in middle school and have always wondered why i was in it! it was only me and maybe 5 other kids. I ask my parents but they say they dont remember why i was apart of it.",

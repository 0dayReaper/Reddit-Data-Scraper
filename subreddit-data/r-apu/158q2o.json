            "comment": "Do you mean socially, or academically? Socially the school is very good at fostering a sense of \"community\" (you will hear that word until it becomes a cliche, but they mean what they say) If you are looking for a place to get wasted and partying then you'd be better off looking somewhere else where they will let you have alcohol on campus. \"Sheltered but generally open-minded\" is probably a way to describe most (but definitely not all) of the student population. If you are interested in making friends, finding a SO, and learning a bit about the Christian faith, APU is definitely one of your options. \n\nAcademically, the quality of your education will depend on your major. I studied Nursing (graduated Dec '10) and the quality was stellar. My friend studied Graphic Design and she probably could have gotten a better, cheaper education elsewhere. But both of us agree that what we gained socially and personally far outweighed any negatives (for me the negative was that a stellar nursing education means 4+ years of academic hell). The friends we made at APU, we will probably keep for many years to come. I'm not an APU recruiter; the school has many issues (don't even get me started on its issue with \"diversity\") but as a whole people find a very, very positive experience there.",

Well now I'm finance and I really wish I would have actually worked in HS so that I would have gotten into a target school. Moral of the story at least from my perspective that you are paying APU for the 'community' experience that they provide you, not for the strong academic background. Also you had better be prepared to answer many times where APU is, very few people know about it outside of the Christian community and the direct geographical community surrounding it. Academically its a waste of money, socially (if your white and Christian) you'll excel.",

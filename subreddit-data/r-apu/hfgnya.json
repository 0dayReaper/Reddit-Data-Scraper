Should I go with a more personal direction or follow the guidelines and only the guidelines? And I'm not Christian, will that hurt my chances?\n\nThanks any tips will help!",

It asked me if I would commit to chapel and such of course as a Grad student you wouldn't have to worry about that.But just to sum my answer, if you're worried that you are not Christian and applying to APU will lower your chances it won't. I applied as a Catholic, they give lots of chances to people. The admissions committee is really understanding and generous in accepting students. I rejected their offer for Fall 2019, I re applied for Spring 2020 and I was accepted yet again. No worries if you've got the grades and show commitment there is nothing to be afraid of. \n\nAlso I personally think you should do a little bit of both, so personal but then following the guidelines. They want to know more about you, so don't be afraid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck!",

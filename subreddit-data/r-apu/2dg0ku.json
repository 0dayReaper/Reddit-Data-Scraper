However my concentration was in Media Studies which was a lot of film courses.\n\nSince graduating I've dived back into video editing and working on graphics at my church.\n\nIt was a combo of After Effects and Premiere. I did all of the animation in AE and then exported the uncompressed file to premiere and added the fades and exported it for YouTube from there.\n\nIf you're going to be entering the film program I would suggest taking \"Christianity and the Creative Process\" and I think it's \"Beginning Script Writing\" or some thing like that, it's the first level of script writing class, from Thomas Parham. He's the BOMB!\n ",

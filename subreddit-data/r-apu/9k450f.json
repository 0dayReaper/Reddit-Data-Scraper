Many students enter apu with some view points and leave with new insight. If this insight doesn\u2019t align with the school\u2019s alleged Christian values, did the school fail a student? I may be way off topic here. \n",

Also, as a Christian University, they are going to have values that should be upheld due to the beliefs of the religion. Can you really claim to be a \"Christian\" university if you do not hold any of the universal beliefs?",

            "comment": "Alum here ('07). The moral clauses. I smoked all through out college, just had to do it off campus. Drank (mostly off campus), drank underage too, was on campus drunk, never got turned in or punished. I also didn't flaunt it, basically went straight to my room if I came back drunk.\n\nI'm gay, in my day is was a little different. Gay issues were just started to really be discussed on campus, but you still really couldn't be out or if you were you had to fake 'struggle' with it for the admins. Basically act like you were trying to change. Actually if any more recent grads are reading this, what is it like now for LGBT students? I was sexually active but not on campus and not with anyone from APU (as you could imagine it would be for a gay guy). If you are sexually active on campus just be careful. Really gauge your roomies and be quiet. I did know some people who got turned in by roomies for drinking or sex but, and I'm being honest, it was always girls who did it. Don't know why, that's just how it happened. \n\nIf you're in the Mods or Apartments it is easier to get away with stuff than the dorms, so long as your roomies are cool or not there. It's not like your bag or grocery bag gets checked by RAs for alcohol and condoms. My memory is a little hazy on visiting hours but for the dorm it was something like 12-10 during the week and 10-11 on the weekends and all other housing it was like 9-12 every day, I think. The online handbook should say. They're pretty liberal about it, you could close your door with opposite sex visitors, but they 'encouraged' us not to. After reading this it makes me sound like I was the bad kid on campus, I was actually pretty tame, I'm just highlighting the \"bad\" stuff I did because that seems to be what your question is geared toward.

A gay person who has come out may have to have mandatory counseling, for example. There is an informal GSA known as \"Haven\" on the campus, but it is semi-underground. If the OP is interested in getting connected with it, I could point her/him in the right direction.",

He was an 'ex-gay' and would bring a guy called Sy Rogers (another ex gay) into chapel for a 2 or 3 day series every year. I was part of the first group for 'struggle and change' on campus. Funny thing is a few weeks into it most of us decided it was BS, kept going to keep up appearances then go dancing in WeHo on the weekends \n\nEdit to the OP: I wasn't implying you're LGBT, reading it again it sounds like I might have been. I was just relaying my personal experience. Also the long and short of it are APU is what you make of it. If you want to be super sheltered with tons of accountability, as they call it, you can. If you want the average go to class, booze sometimes, have sex sometimes college experience you can do that too. If that is what you want I might live on campus your first year (I take it you'll be going in as a sophomore, which means you'll be in the Mods or Apartments), get to know some people, get a feel for campus life, then the next year get an near by off campus apartment with some roomies (unless something has changed most people would rent from the complex right across from the main East Campus entrance).

If you get caught, you may have some minor consequences. The consequences will vary on a case by case basis. You have alcohol, you could be asked to pour it down the drain. You could get a warning. If you supplied alcohol to people under 21, you may face more serious consequences. If your sexual behavior is inhospitable to your roommate, you may have to move. I'm not sure if any punishments go as far as expulsion, but more serious punishments would probably be used the more you seem to be detrimental to \"community life.\"\n\nIt depends on the Resident Director of your residence, but most RD's have an understanding that alcohol and sexual policies are designed to benefit community life, which means the less you disrupt community life, the less it matters. You probably won't even get caught unless you have done something disruptive (loud parties, loud sex, something that caused your potentially conservative roommate to report to their RD that he or she feels unwelcome in his or her own home). With a bit of common sense, you will never be caught. As an RA, I never caught anything more serious than violation of \"visitation hours,\" which pretty much only gets you a slap on the wrist. No one is *trying* to catch you, unless they are an asshole.\n\n\nPros and Cons of APU that I can speak to?\n\nPros:\n\nSome departments are actually quite good programs: Social Work, Theology, Biblical Studies, Nursing\n\nAs far as Christian schools go, it has a really interesting environment. It is distinctly and intentionally Christian, but it is not interested in a fundamentalist withdrawal from secular discourse. It is a community genuinely trying to be Christian in the real world. There are a number of fascinating progressive subcultures in the community.\n\nCons:\n\nIt's really expensive.\n\nThe dominant culture put out by the administration is pretty conservative.\n\nIf you aren't a Christian, you are likely to feel out of place and maybe unwelcome.\n\n\n\nWas there something in particular you wanted to know? What makes you interested in APU?",

The class was small, the teacher was funny and the course was interesting. The community sense feels nice since I grew up in a big city where you can sometimes feel isolated. APU is only 20-30 minutes away from my home without traffic which is a plus for me. \n\nFor a long time, I thought I was going to transfer to a CalState but the friendly atmosphere at APU appeals me.\n\nDo we fill out a questionnaire before you move into the apartment so your personalities and lifestyles match?\n For example: I'm not an early bird. I'm athletic but a bookworm. I'm a Christian that just want to be a good person and treat others like I would want to be treated myself. Especially the not to judge other people.\n\nHow is the Psychology program? I want specialize in I/O Psych. \n\nBesides theology class. How much does religion plays into the average classroom?\n\nWhat are the visitation hours? When are they?\n\nIs it irrational to have a fear that APU will be like Pleasantville? Happy and wholesome on top but repressed and prejudice? Is it like that???\n\nThese are just some of the questions I can think of so far.\n",

I always got good wildcard roommates, but I think there was a bit of luck in that.\n\nI don't know much about the Psych program. I don't even know what I/O Psych is. I did have one friend who was a Psych major and she enjoyed it. She ended up having the opportunity to help a professor do research, so that's gotta be good at least. There was at least one Psych professor to avoid, who will advocate things like \"reparative therapy\" as a response to homosexuality. \n\nI think there will be a \"faith integration\" aspect to every class, but that will vary greatly from class to class. It could mean asking how things play out in churches, or it could mean writing a weird reflection paper on how learning biology has given you an appreciation for God's creation. I was a Theo major so I didn't have much out of place \"faith integration.\"\n\nVisitation hours is when you are allowed to have a person of the opposite gender in your room. I think that for the apartments it was midnight on weekdays and 2am on the weekends. Dorm was 10pm and 12am.\n\nI think APU has a bit of a pleasantville vibe (that's not an irrational fear), but most people are pretty genuine. Part of it is that you will have students that have been homeschooled or in private Christian school for their whole lives. You will have missionary kids and pastors kids (sometimes not as sheltered, sometimes oblivious to the rest of the world). You will probably get less of the pleasantville if you live in the transfer housing because most transfers have spent a few years at another 4yr college or community college.\n\nAPU does have an interesting community that can be really cool sometimes. Some colleges that I wish I had been more aware of in the area that seems really cool are the Claremont Colleges. They are pretty prestigious and I'm not sure how they handle transfers, but they might be worth a look. ",

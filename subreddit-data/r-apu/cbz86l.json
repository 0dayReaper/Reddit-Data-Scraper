            "comment": "Pros: generally small classes so you get more professor interaction.  One of my profs invited us to his house for the last class session.  That's pretty cool.  Most of the profs actually care about you.  Also bible classes (I enjoyed them), and chapel 3X a week (which may be a con depending on you).  Also lots of service opportunities.  You generally can get classes pretty easily as opposed to classes filling up too fast.  The proffs will help you with your schedule if you need.  \n\n\n\nCons:  Way more expensive than public college, might be more affordable for you to just go to a public college.  I wish I did.",

    "postText": "Hello my fellow Cougars,\n\nSeeing that the creator and old moderator of this sub /u/ smoothmoniker went inactive for over a year, I have decided to step in and become the moderator for this sub. My goal is to grow this subreddit so that we can eventually turn it into a place for networking and socializing. In addition to this, I would like everyone to edit their flair to match their major so that we can more clearly identify people. While I am an agnostic/atheist, I do not expect everyone on here to be, and I want it to be fully known that both Christians and Non Believers, as well as any other religion are fully welcomed and respected here. Any banter or use of memes that is too extreme and harmful to the community will be banned. Thank you for respecting everyone and their beliefs. Finally, if anyone knows people that are redditors but are not subscribed, mention it to them. Thanks and I hope to see you guys around.\n\n**EDIT** P.S. I will be working on some basic CSS changes to our page, however I am not savvy with CSS and it will take me awhile to figure it out and get things spruced up. If anyone has any CSS knowledge and is willing to do some basic changes I would really appreciate it, pm me if you do. Thanks! ",

I know not a lot of schools allow repeats to stuff like anatomy and physiology, but if you can, it\u2019ll significantly increase your chances. Don\u2019t be afraid to go out of state. Don\u2019t be afraid to get your ADN at a community and transfer because a lot of schools have an ADN-BSN and even some ADN-MSN pathways. Or hell, Western has the same price tag and I\u2019m told it\u2019s not as difficult to get into, but that\u2019s just from here say. \n\nAnd I\u2019m still like 22k in student debt from one year of undergrad at APU. If you can swing the price tag, it\u2019s not a bad option. \n\nBest of luck!",

    "postText": "Hi! I was wondering how difficult it would be to get accepted into APU? I have a 3.4 cumulative GPA in HS, however, I made some bad choices in the past regarding my college education right after I finished HS. I regret attending college back then due to my immaturity, which definitely hurt my GPA in college (due to bad choices and depression which affected my motivation). However, almost 5 years later, I am now 25 (about to be 26), and currently enrolled in a LVN program. I fell in love with nursing and have grown a passion for the field and the studies (I currently have a 3.5 GPA in the LVN program) :)\n\nI graduate in a few months and decided to continue my education. I was looking into the LVN - BSN program, or to just apply for the 'nursing major' program and start as a freshman. However, I am worried about my old college transcripts and was wondering if that would ruin my chances of getting accepted into APU? \n\nAny advice will help! \\^\\_\\^",

Unless someone from admissions is lurking in here it might be hard to get much feedback about your specific situation. I wish you the best though - APU has a great nursing program.",

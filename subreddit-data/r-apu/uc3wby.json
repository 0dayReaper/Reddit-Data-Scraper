    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm about to enroll for the Exercise Physiology lecture/lab course (KIN 363) with William Wilkinson for this Summer I Term (05/09-06/10). There are no reviews of him on ratemyprofessor. Has anyone taken this class with him? Really curious how much of a struggle it will be or if an A is reachable with consistent studying.\n\nPlease let me know. Thanks!",

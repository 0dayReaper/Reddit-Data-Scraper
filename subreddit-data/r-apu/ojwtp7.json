I'm getting emails about putting together a new presidential search committee, and requests for parent/alumni surveys about qualities wanted in a new president.  I've been out of the loop for a VERY long time... what's going on?  Ferguson didn't work out?",

I'll rephrase the bottom line issue as this: He got tired of all the political bullshit, and large portions of APU could no longer be led.\n\nEven John Wallace fought some of these battles, but he couldn't walk away, because APU was his life.  I was there in the mid-late 90s, and am sure I wouldn't recognize the place today.  APU was a great place for me over 25 years ago, but I'll be sending my kids to state school.  Makes me sad.\n\nI'm sorry I can't say more publicly.  If this means something to someone out there, great; and I'm sorry if the lack of details frustrates others or causes doubt.",

He had favorite rooms and least favorite rooms to practice in. \n\nCan't help you out much more than that though.",

I\u2019ve been in the band building a little bit for a soul music class, but I know some rooms can be open access to use as free as long as there\u2019s no classes. Otherwise people play outside it all the time and it was fun listening to them practice as I walked to the school of business building. As a freshmen I remember the men\u2019s floors had a practice room, so for sure Trinity has at least a few. \n\nProbably not the most accurate answer you can get, but hopefully this helped a little bit",

And when I was it was either in the lobby or a friend\u2019s dorm. Sorry. For a better answer, I highly recommend emailing campus life for more details. They should know more than I, or at least can contact someone on-site to get an accurate answer for you",

I'm Christian but I'm not extensively religious. My fears is that I won't fit in well here because of that, I tend to hang out with some pieces of shit at school and I'm perfectly fine with this. Anyways, I also fear there won't be much of a party scene or much social life on the weekends. Can anyone comment on this, maybe clarify my perspective. Honesty would be very much appreciated, please don't say APU is perfect for me just because you're a cougar. Thanks!",

To be completely honest, I'm a little skeptical about APU because of its religious affiliation. I'm Christian but I'm not extensively religious. *Edit*: There are also several options for chapel, so if its a style concern, you can probably find a chapel that is more your style.\n\nIf Chapel 3 times a week sounds *okay*, then you'll probably be fine. Sometimes you might actually like chapel. Sometimes you won't. You could visit a chapel or two if you're wondering. \n\n&gt;My fears is that I won't fit in well here because of that, I tend to hang out with some pieces of shit at school and I'm perfectly fine with this. \n\nThere are conservative Christians. There are liberal Christians. There are nominal Christians. There are few non-Christians, and they often feel excluded from community life and sometimes they resent being required to go to chapel . The dominant culture is moderately right leaning evangelical Christian.\n\nOne of the cool things about college is that you can pick who you hang out with all over again. It's likely to be a bigger social climate than your high school, so the cliques are not quite as constricting. You can hang out with the same kind of kids you hung out with in high school, or you may find yourself finding different friends as you explore your own identity and get to know people from backgrounds that you could not have encountered where you grew up. Find your own subculture.\n\n&gt;Anyways, I also fear there won't be much of a party scene or much social life on the weekends.\n\nI wasn't into the party scene, so I can't say much more than that it exists. Alcohol is banned on campus, so any party with alcohol will probably be hosted off-campus by a local house that is being rented out to APU students, by a student whose home-town is nearby, or by another college nearby (Citrus).\n\nThere is an active non-party scene too. There will be students going to the beach and having a bonfire every weekend in fall and spring (pretty much). It's also common for students to explore different parts of LA, hang out in Pasadena, or buy an annual pass to Disneyland. I can more confidently say that there is social life on weekends than that there will be the party scene you are looking for.\n\nLet me know if you have ay other questions.",

Although they're giving me a significant amount of money, I don't know if I can justify getting myself into debt for a school that wasn't my first choice. I've narrowed my decision down to either APU or doing community college for a year with hopes of transferring to UCI. Did you attend the APU overnight preview?\n",

Also my oldest brother will be graduating in a few days now from APU so I have visited and stayed with him a few times. Really enjoyed the times I have had there. I would say upfront that APU was not at the top of the list, but i'm in love with California (being from Washington), both my brothers will be close, and they also offered me enough money that I knew I could afford it without being constantly stressed about money. If you have any other questions I'd love to help you figure stuff out! PM if ya want! Good luck with your decisions!",

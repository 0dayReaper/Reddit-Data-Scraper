    "postText": "Pretty much the title ^\n\n- Looking into more sub-urban LAC's to apply to, mainly looking for matches in terms of school culture, fit with major, and offcampus life and transportation \n\n- Current schools I plan on applying to for reference are like tufts, amherst, F&amp;M, Skidmore, Vassar, Carleton, Haverford, Wesleyan University, and some SUNYS. (my main problem is that I have too many reach schools - F&amp;M and Skidmore are the only match schools from my list there. Denison looks like a good stat match for me, but I of course want to look into other aspects of the college\n\n- how rural is denison university? interested in a more sub-urban type of LAC - especially with transportation to the bigger/notable cities (amherst is an exception from the list I mentioned, but yea)\n\n- Transportation to big cities? Is it really far? What exactly do students do offcampus?\n\n- Is campus life there cliquey at all? What about in terms of diversity - how is the student population and how are the clubs/organizations and stuff?\n\n- Anything in specific about geoscience/earth science/computer science? I will probably be delving into those subjects as my majors or minors\n\nI'll keep looking into the university myself, but I figure that theres no harm in also asking here and seeing what happens. ty!",

            "comment": "It is definitely rural, however, I feel that the school does well to allow you to get off campus with events they usually pay for. and trust me even if you don't know many people someone will eventually ask you to go with them to Columbus.  \nthe town is super cute I love it, and the food is pretty okay for me to it's a nice walk and it has the basic necessities.   \n\n\nthe transportation, eeeeeh not too good. There is an uber-connected to the schools that won't charge you much if you go with friends but like I said before as long as you on campus the school tries to let you attend events outside of Granville as often as they can, for me that's good enough.   \n\n\nI honestly don't leave campus unless there's something going on in Columbus tbh, the school really keeps you busy in my opinion.   \n\n\nI personally, as a Hispanic student do not feel like Denison is cliquey, sure some people play into the stereotype but not really. it's as diverse as a university in Ohio can get lol. but I feel they are trying and the students of color here do a lot to represent themselves.   \n\n\nThe organization's here are great, there is everything in terms of clubs, you pick what you like and if there isn't anything you like make your own.   \n\n\nI'm not a science major but i do know there is a geology club that is pretty cool, sorry for the long post and hope i could help",

Private vehicle is really only practical way \n- yes its cliquey , clubs are probably roughly similar to other schools.  \n- I was a geoscience major and cs minor - both departments are fantastic.",

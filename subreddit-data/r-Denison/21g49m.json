Curious what you guys think about this situation in general, if the extra hour will help, who is to blame...",

            "comment": "It's not Brew's fault. It was his fault. The bartender did exactly what they are supposed to do, and now they are being forced to change what time they close (Ohio's law for last call is at 2:00 am bars shut down at 2:30am). The media is trying to put the blame on someone else, we can clearly see that in the article above. \n\nIt was the kid's fault. Simple. \n\nHe should have not drank that much, he should have wore a coat, his friends should have realized that he was drunk and walked him home. But instead we are here, bickering over the who, what, when, where, and why's. It's a really a tragedy for his family. I can't imagine what they are going through.\n\nThe toxicology report should be turning up within a week or two. I will make my final judgements after seeing this report.",

            "comment": "As a senior, his passing really brought together my class. He is the third person my class has lost and as such I'm in the process of having some of our senior week funds used towards a memorial for all three students.  \n\nFurthermore, DCGA has just put forth nearly $400,000 for a Roost renovation and the creation of a an on-campus bar in the basement of Chamberlain, affectionately called The Chamber.  \n\nDCGA policy committee is working on drafting up a rideshare service that is student run. Essentially a shuttle that runs from the sunnies to east to granville to sunnies.  \n\nAs the other commenter said, it's a tragedy, and it's easy to place blame. But it's not constructive. Moving forward and making changes to prevent this from ever happening again is much more positive and respectful to the life lost. ",

I really need a good GPA in college and I was wondering if it's possible to get mostly As at Denison. \n\nI would be very grateful for any responses. Thank you.",

            "comment": "My experience:\n\n- You'll learn a lot (like, much more than you thought you'd learn in college).\n- You'll be surrounded by lots of people smarter than you.\n- It won't be easy.\n- Grade deflation (not inflation like at many other schools) is the norm at Denison.\n- No, getting all As is not the norm at Denison. And personally, I think it's a silly objective going into university. If you want all As, be incredibly studious, very smart, a suck-up (most professors worth their salt will see through this), or go to an Ivy League school or a state school.\n\nDenison (and most LACs) are places for rigor and challenging yourself. I'd say that should be your aim. If you're worried about GPA for grad school/law school/med school/etc, [Denison has pretty excellent placement results irrespective of GPA](https://denison.edu/the-denison-difference).",

Major, relationships on campus, academic performance, extracurricular involvement, personal connections, and level of effort seeking an internship/job all play into it.\n\nAgain (see link in original comment), Denison has very strong post-grad employment or grad school enrollment numbers.\n\nAs with most things in life (unless you're fantastically well-connected or wealthy), opportunities won't just come to you\u2013\u2013you have to seek them out.",

As long as you show up and do the work you'll be fine and you'll learn a lot. Work can pile up if you let it (I'm currently overwhelmed with work for finals) but if you're better at spacing out your work than me you'll do great.",

Can someone suggest good study spots in the area? Libraries or coffee shops for example... (Not a Denison student, so I don\u2019t know if your library is open to the public or not)",

If not, the local public library is a good spot too. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind being outdoors, there is a lot of outdoor study space on campus or on main street. \n\nNewark isn\u2019t far away, they may have public library spots as well.  \n\nGood luck on the exam, boards aren\u2019t fun.",

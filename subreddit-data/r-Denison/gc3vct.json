    "postText": "Greetings!  \n\n\nI'm an international from India, who's committed to Denison this week (day before the deadline lol). I have an aid package of 50k which puts my expected cost of attendance at 20k.  \n\n\nI'm considering majoring in CS and/or Math but I couldn't really find anything related to it on the internet. So in your experience, how good are the CS and STEM courses at Denison? Is it worth it or should I consider going somewhere else?  \n\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I am a Math and CS student at Denison. Our department is one of the larger departments on Campus. I feel it has been a good education, but I have been to no other department to compare it to which I have been a student at. Despite this, people are friendly and lot of the students know each other well.\n\nDenison has a very theoretical approach to math and CS where they don't emphasize practical application and how to get a job with your skills directly, but rather the basis in how these sciences work. For example, software engineering is sometimes a core class in other school, while it's a rotating elective at Denison. Instead, Denison CS students are required to take mathematical foundations of computer science and advanced algorithms.\n\nThe classes that teach applications like networking, video game design, and AI will most likely only be available to you during your junior and senior years. For math, classes like topology, abstract algebra, and combinatorics are offered at a higher level.\n\nSome great faculty for CS are:\nAshwin Lall, Matt Kretchmar, and Tom Bressoud\n\nSome great faculty for Math are:\nSarah Wolff, Lew Ludwig, and May Mei\n\n\nDenison is great in this area, but if you want to have a harder focus on math and CS ordered towards a career other than research, you can look at bigger state schools like OSU or UC",

                    "comment": "Great answer, I'd second this. You'll get a strong theoretical foundation at Denison. You have the chance to get to know your professors on a first-name basis. There is the downside that some electives might come around only once every couple of years, since it's a small department compared to larger schools. I'd add the Jessen Havill is also an outstanding professor in the CS department; he was a recent addition in my time and he was a great teacher who really knew his stuff. Same for Matt Kretchmar, though I'm not as familiar with the other ones who are there now. In general Denison attracts professors who care about their students and are passionate about teaching, which isn't always the case at larger or more research-oriented schools.\n\nAt Denison you will get a liberal arts education, which means you will have to take a diverse set of classes. This is probably a good thing for most people, but it was hard for me the first couple of years when I really just wanted to dive deep into CS. I thought about trying to transfer, but I'm glad I didn't.\n\nI graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Math almost 20 years ago, so some things have probably changed since then. I did my master's in CS at Cornell a few years later and now I work at a major tech company. I feel like I was well prepared overall. Feel free to direct message me if you want to chat more.",

At no other similarly sized school will you find a biology department with a 6-story building all to itself, where each professor gets their own office and lab space to conduct their research. The professors are all incredible, and it's always interesting when they include their own research in the classes they teach. There are also excellent opportunities to do research both during the summer and during the semester. I've also taken classes in the math, geosciences and chemistry departments. Although I found these classes to be a bit tougher (biology is truly my only forte in STEM), the professors are always kind, accommodating and available to give help if needed. I have a number of friends in the DA and CS programs (and I was roommates with one of the CS professors' son) who talk about how helpful the professors are in some of the tougher classes.",

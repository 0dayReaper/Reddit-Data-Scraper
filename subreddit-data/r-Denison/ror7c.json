Now, a lot of the frat fanboys will tell you that Denison is a quiet, boring backwater and that they could've been doing keg stands at Cornell, but absolutely everyone else who actually makes a point of being active has an absolutely brilliant time.  So if you're willing to actually do things to make it happen, Denison will be the best experience of your life. ",

The advantage of it being a small school is that people everywhere are involved in unique organizations and clubs. It's not taboo at all like it may be at bigger schools to be a club member.\n\nAnother advantage of Denison, I would argue, are the professors. We really do have a strong staff campus-wide. They're all brilliant in their own ways and very passionate about their fields.\n\nI have to disagree about the partying, however. I wasn't a member of any sororities and I partied a lot in Columbus because that's where my friends were, but despite our small size, I would argue that Denison knows how to party. You'll get nasty sweaty because you live and party in dorms all four years, and kegs aren't allowed, but it can still get pretty rowdy. If you're into that sort of thing, trust me, you can find it.\n\nAnd if you're not, you can certainly avoid it!\n\nLastly, the campus is gorgeous and all the buildings have great napping spots for in between classes. Ha, sounds silly, but if you ever pull an all-nighter and have an hour in between classes, check out the couches in the newer buildings that face huge windows. You can sleep like a baby on those things.\n\nCons: quiet hours at 1am (this may be a pro depending on your lifestyle, however. Also, the food gets real old after four years. Learn to cook and spend less time in the cafeterias. Also. Ihaven't been there since the new Ebaugh was built but watch out cos skunks looooove that area. \n\nHope this helps and to the original comment, yayyy 2011!",

Dale T is retiring after this year, I beleive, so his speeches will not be around much longer. \n\nI came up with what I think is a good summary of Denison's campus: Lots of people passionate about a lot of things. \n\nI, for one, am an actor/singer, theatre/political science double major, fraternity brother, a capella singer, ex-ultimate frisbee player. Because of fairly constant theatre obligations I am not invloved in half the amount of things I could be. \n\nIt may take a little while (every freshman wants to transfer) but you will find your niche, and when you do- it's a great place to be.

Do you have any particlar questions for us? I'm just kinda throwing stuff out there, haha",

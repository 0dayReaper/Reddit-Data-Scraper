    "postText": "I saw Cookie Sunkle at a grocery store in Granville yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person and not just through emails, but I didn\u2019t want to be rude bother her and ask her for photos or anything.\nShe said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d\nI was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but she kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cMiss, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, Cookie stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, Cookie kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly. \n\nOdd running into both her and Adam over break. ",

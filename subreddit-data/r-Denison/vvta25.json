            "comment": "In my opinion, the food is pretty good. Yeah, it's repetitive but it's food you know what is there to complain about. \n\n  \n\\-------------\n\n**Curtis:**\n\nBreakfast is always the same, it consists of Scrambled Eggs with either shredded potatoes or tater tots with sausages and a little dessert that's warmed up. There is also a waffle bar where you can make your own waffle that is left on for the entire day. And there is also a dessert and an ice cream bar that is there for the entire day, and yes the desserts do rotate every breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The ice cream only rotates if they are finished. There is also a machine where you can get drinks which if I remember correctly include, pomegranate vitamin water, water, die Pepsi, Pepsi, mountain dew, root beer, Gatorade, Powerade, apple juice, orange juice, sprite, HI-C (Fruit Punch) and a couple of others.   \n\n\nFor Lunch, they remove all of the breakfast and replace it with lunch food, so if you like to eat breakfast around 2 pm cuz you wake up late then this is going to suck for you. Just to let you know as a vegetarian and this problem most likely doesn't involve you but it's good to point out, **THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO VEGETARIAN OPTIONS**, if you are vegetarian expect to eat a lot of cheese pizza \\^\\_\\^. Also starting from Lunch -&gt; Dinner they have a Pizza bar which consists of Cheese Pizza, Pepperoni Pizza, and a special third mystery pizza. Also at this time the dessert bar mainly puts out cookies and brownies however the dessert could be different I am just stating the average desserts they put out during Lunch hours. They also offer a deli bar. So if you like sandwiches then they can make custom ones for you at your request.  They also have a Salad bar open from Lunch thru dinner.  \n\n\nDinner time is practically the same as lunch but during these times they most of the time get rid of the Deli bar and replace it with more desserts like cookies, ice cream, donut balls and etc. You can make your own creation for example if you want an ice cream sandwich you can get 2 cookies and smash them in an ice cream ball and boom ice cream sandwich. Also forgot to mention throughout the day they also have coffee machines and tea machines so if you want tea at any time or coffee then you can just get it, they also have bread and a toaster and other condiments like Peanut Butter and Jelly and butter and etc.  \n\\-------------\n\n**SLAYTER:**  \nEverything here costs money, they have a Pub burger which is an abomination of a burger it literally looks disgusting it just has too much cheese and too much junk on it. They also have a black bean burger which is an option for vegetarians and maybe vegans (**I DONT KNOW I AM NOT VEGAN** **PLEASE DONT GET MAD AT ME)** They also have an Impossible Burger which in my opinion is really good, whenever I am in the mood I always get an impossible burger with no cheese, avocado, lettuce with the side of rice. They also have other burgers but I barely go to Slayter so I don't know. Also around Slayter, they have a deli bar with much more options than the ones at Huffman or Curtis. I never used the deli bar but people say it is pretty good. Now also at Slayter, it's like a tiny grocery store, the only downside is that everything is **OVERPRICED**, a single monster energy drink is **3.75**. The other stuff is also overpriced. Now around 11 pm - 1 am I believe on the third floor there is a secret night takeout place that opens up, they primarily serve pizza, nachos, chicken wings, mac &amp; cheese, alcohol, and other drinks. Now I got to say. I live in New York I come from Queens, and what annoys me is that Slayter has this \"New York Style Pizza\" I have got it once and I just have to say **THIS IS NOT A NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA** All they do is put so much fucking mozzarella on the pizza and then on top of that is more cheese so there is barely any pizza sauce. Like wtf is that?????? By Slayter there is also a coffee shop which I got to say, is **REALLY GOOD COFFEE SHOP**. If you are a fan of Starbucks or Dunkin donuts, they make coffee exactly like them it's pretty crazy.  \n\\-------------\n\n**HUFFMAN:**  \nIt's pretty much the same exact thing as Curtis the only difference is that the people who cook here don't do the best job. Once you are on campus there is always an argument where people say which is better Curtis or Huffman. If you ask me I'm on **TEAM CURTIS**.  \n\n\n\\-------------\n\nOverall, Denison's food is 7.5/10, in reality, if you don't like the food every residence hall has a kitchen so you can cook your own food. But yeah I really like Denison Food. If you really want to take a look at the food at Denison then go to the [Bon Appetit website](https://denison.cafebonappetit.com/) and they have their whole menu of food on there.  \n\n\nJust be careful about how much food you intake because let me tell you this Freshman15 does exist and if you aren't careful you will gain 15 pounds. **No joke**.",

I also feel like there are many many options and that you can find something to eat that is at least okay everyday. If you\u2019re gluten free, vegetarian, or vegan you will have less options and it can be a little bit repetitive. I usually feel like the food has almost no spices, but I\u2019m also not from the US and I usually eat well-flavored foods. I feel like the meals from the traditional dining halls can be either too salty/ spicy or with no flavor at all. I really like food from Slivy\u2019s and sometimes from Slayter.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s terrible. These responses are either from people with no tastebuds or are from the administration trying to brain wash you. Everyone at Denison develops IBS after less than a week of eating at the dining halls. Everything is overpriced and the school forces students to be on a meal plan for three years in a row. The normal meal plan costs about $2,800, but students get $1,500 in money to spend on food. You\u2019d think the price of food would be adjusted for this. However, a burger still costs about $10 and they also charge you for sauce.",

If those idiots stopped writing angry letters to no one in particular like an impotent soccer mom and did something to actually bring back the \"glory days\" they whine about so much. Like, I dunno, something other than hiding in their rooms writing drunken tirades of all the curse words they could think of, or disrespecting the art of graffiti on perfectly innocent walls. \n\nAnd threatening the freshmen? That's like kicking puppies. They don't know not to chew up the furniture yet, but they'll figure it out eventually. The majority of us upperclassmen aren't going to let a few assholes trash the freshmen's stuff just because a few wingless morons are butthurt.",

Their pranks were entertaining and sometimes even productive.\n\nNow they just whine about nonexistent problems. I mean, come on, every year the incoming class seems drunker.  Oh, and remember that time they passed out flyers telling everyone to steal cups from Slayter to protest high food costs?  No.  You don't.  Because they suck at distribution.  And even if you had heard about it, you wouldn't have done it because it's a stupid idea.  And sometimes they pull pranks, but they're never particularly entertaining.  And sometimes they're inconvenient or irritating.  Denison might be a better place without them, but they never have enough of an impact on anything for anyone to care.  So, carry on with your sucking, wingless angels.  ",

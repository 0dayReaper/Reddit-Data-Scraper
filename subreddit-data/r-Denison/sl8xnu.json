But if you want quieter and less crowded living space you can select that, and it\u2019ll put you in a house with less than 40 people. I had morrow house which was amazing. Either way you can\u2019t choose specifically what hall to live in. It\u2019s more randomized.",

You can also be in Crawford however not that many people like being there cuz Huffman sucks. The only good thing about being at Crawford is that you are close to the gym, however, you are pretty far away from the main building such as Slayter and etc. In my opinion, it doesn't matter if you are an upcoming freshman you have a high chance of living in Shorney.",

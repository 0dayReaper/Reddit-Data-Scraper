    "postText": "Hi everyone. I am currently a rising junior from Pakistan, with a CGPA of 3.76/4.0 (I am on the Deans Honor List). If it helps, I am currently studying at a highly selective institution, considered the best in the country, and it is one of the few unis which are internationally accredited. I recently applied for transfer admission since they are still accepting on a rolling basis. I have got lots of extra curriculars, volunteer work and internships. Currently, when they asked me for how much I can contribute per year, I wrote 8500 dollars. I know I am already late. Do I still have a chance? I am interested in the anthro-socio program. Thanks guys.",

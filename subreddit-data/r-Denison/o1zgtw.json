My cousin is starting at Denison in the fall and I\u2019d like to give him gift cards for fun things to do in town or restaurants (local or even fast food!) that are a nice break from a dining plan. What is nearby or accessible without a car that will be helpful to him? TIA!",

Although a nice gesture, I think it would be more a pain in the butt the first year trying to get down to Granville and eat without a car. The campus dining halls are actually quite good and Slayter has some food options he could use the cash/gift cards to order. Either way, that is a great gesture :-)",

Our circle(s) of friends from both deparments included a lot of LGBTQ folks with varying interests.\n\nFun fact: Andrew Levitt who was on Rupaul's drag race as Nina West is a Denison alum: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_West\nReally amazing person.\n\nFwiw I was never into greek life and if that matters to you, it may be a different experience. But otherwise I'm pretty sure you'll find a good group.",

            "comment": "Hi I\u2019m a rising Junior at Denison majoring in history.  The Greek life can seem heavy for some people, but it doesn\u2019t have that much of an effect on social life.  I have very good friends who are part of Greek life and others who aren\u2019t, it just depends how much time you want so devote it.  The vibe (in my personal opinion) is pretty chill and friendly with lots of people from different backgrounds getting along pretty well. The professors are very engaging and love to talk outside of class, and the coursework can be light or heavy depending on the class.  In my history classes I generally have lots of readings with only a few big essays, while in the math classes there will be a lot more consistent homework.  I\u2019be only taken an introduction to political theory class, but if the department is anything like the history department (which from what I hear it is), then you\u2019ll enjoy studying political science.  Opinions on the dining halls differ depending on what you like, but I think they\u2019re all great and offer a good range of food choices that change day to day.  I love eating at Huffman, which is over by the sophomore and junior housing in East Quad.\n\nThis is all only from my personal experience and other people might say differently, but basically what I\u2019m saying for most of your questions is that there\u2019s something for everyone at Denison and you won\u2019t need to worry about a huge overarching activity or program that dominates the social scene.",

            "comment": "I'm a current rising junior, so hopefully this helps out! Feel free to pm me any other questions you have or just comment them below whatever works. \n\n\n1.\tI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s a heavy Greek scene at Denison. Can non-Greeks/more introverted people still have a solid social life? Would they end up feeling left out?\n\n\nDue to our campus size, Greek life is about 20-25% of our campus. I'm in Greek life and honestly if you can pay for it (it is nowhere near as expensive as southern or larger schools, but isn't free) and see yourself there, I definitely recommend. You can definitely join parties without being greek, as there's usually a handful hosted every weekend + smaller parties friends have in dorms or open campus parties at the moonies. Greek formal recruitment at Denison is in the spring, so first years always usually have a friend group/social circle by the time it rolls around anyways. You'll meet friends in class, the dining hall, clubs, etc. Just be friendly and people will want ti be friends with you. Gaming guild for example has lots of introverts and we literally just hangout and play video games and eat snacks. Sometimes I go to anime club and they just binge anime together on a huge screen in one of the lecture halls and chat and sometimes okay games too. There's plenty of clubs tho so if these aren't your thing you'll find your place. \n\n\n2.\tWhat\u2019s the campus vibe/culture? What kind of people tend to go to Denison, and what kind of people don\u2019t?\n\nI'd say there's some of everything. Rich kids, poor kids, middle class kids, we're ethnically diverse for the size but we tend to be more diverse from international students than domestic students. Not a bad thing just that it'll seem more diverse on paper than it is. I'd say people here are friendly, and mostly chill. There's some heavy partiers but it's easy to find or avoid depending on what you want. We have some kids that look like tik tok famous type of kids and some that are average. I'd say we have some of everything and there's not more of one than another since everyone sorta blends on campus. Since we do spring formal recruitment, you'll have plenty of time to decide if it's for you. Every sorority on campus (MGC, nphc, etc)  also does COB/informal recruitment outside of the spring NPC rush so if you decide sophomore year first semester you want to join you will be able to try and have a good shot. I'm not sure how it is for IFC frats though as far as recruitment as an upper classman. I know MGC, nphc, does things on a different timeline but I have many friends that joined their other orgs as a sophomore or junior and it isn't weird to do so. \n\n\n3.\tHow are the professors? Are they generally engaged with students and easy to talk to?\n\nSo far I've only had 2 crap profesors, one just got approved for tenure (idk HOW but probably because ~diversity~) and the other was a visiting teacher for just one semester while another prof was on leave. Hated both of those guys but everyone else is incredibly dedicated to making sure you succeed. I've never had a teacher give me a poor grade and not offer me resources, ask me to workshop in office hours a study plan, or even a chance to redo the assignment. Teachers here really want you to do better even if it means they have to re-teach you the material during office hours or after class. Teachers here are really nice and they'll actually talk to you and want to help you, and see you as a young adult. They'll remember what you talk about with them, they don't treat you like a baby or forget your name by the next class day. They truly make an effort. \n\n4.\tWhat\u2019s the coursework like? \n\nReally depends on the class and major. Stem (bio, Chem, DA) of course will have plenty of labs, and classes like photography, ceramics, theater will require lots of time outside of class. If it isn't your major I'd suggest doing it when you have more free time/less heavy courses for a semester. The earlier you take these the better because you'll have more work when you get to higher level classes junior and senior year. I'm an ANSO major and it's a lot of reading and papers. I've taken CS and Bio 210, really depends on the teacher for those. Some are textbook heavy and some aren't. Ask around to upper class students when you register for class so you get someone who won't make you read the book cover to cover lol \n\n5.\tHow are the career development opportunities? Is it easy to access good internships?\n\n\nYES. It's so easy to find internships. The Knowlton Center regularly invites companies to campus, they'll host info sessions about jobs/internships. Bring a nice outfit (khaki pants, button up, don't wear a tie to this lol, or for ladies a nice sun dress or a business casual outfit, doesn't have to be too dressy). They also host career building workshops over weekends, etc etc. Denison also has alumni events on campus, like recently the BSU turned 50, tons of alumni and students networking events. There was a Sophomore career conference that took place over a weekend with dozens of alums, Outlook hosted one as well that could be used to network!! Denison has helped me find internships every summer (even this summer in my hometown after I lost my first one due to covid, rip summer in Tennessee), along with helping pay for expenses like rent and travel etc if your internship is paid or not. I had one in sf last summer, fully covered by Denison. My resume is (imo) very good and I cam always ask the KC for help or advice. One of the best groups of staff on campus! 10000/10 recomend. You can go in anytime, even freshman year to start working on your resume or LinkedIn. It's never too early especially when you have free professional help. \n\n\n\n\n6.\tHow are the econ and polisci programs? I know there are a lot of major options in those fields! \n\nI'm not in these departments so I'm not sure, I have a friend who is a polisci major I can ask if you'd like! \n\n7.\tWhat are the best and worst parts of Denison?\n\nMy least favorite thing is housing/rescom. The student RAs are fine but the office itself is a mess. If you don't have any special housing requests for medical stuff you should be fine but if you ever need to change rooms it'll be annoying. It'll happen they're just weird about it and if you decide to be an RA to save money - don't. It's severely underpaid for the amount of work you're doing and no, free housing doesn't make it worthwhile. That isn't just a Denison issue though housing stinks at a lot of universities. \n\nBest part - campus culture. Everyone here is pretty friendly and sweet as far as a majority of faculty and students go. People will offer to help you out, study with you, etc. It's very easy to make friends! Since it's a smaller school you almost always run into someone you know on the way to class, the dorms, or even to Granville. It's helpful for connections in the future and present because you can never have too many friends or acquaintances. \n\n\n8.\tWhat are some of the most popular clubs/student organizations?\n\nI don't think there's any org that has like, over 50 members aside from DCGA (campus Gov), cultural/C3 orgs, any greek org, or DCA (community service org) and there's probably something I'm forgetting but we are a smaller school so clubs don't have tons of members. Everyone knows about nearly every club but a lot are interest based, like gaming guild or Asian student association. Most clubs average around 20-30 members and new clubs exist every day! \n\n9.\tHow\u2019s the dining hall? I\u2019ve heard mixed messages.\n  \nIt's okay. I wouldn't say it's the best meal I ever ate but it's not terrible. There's enough restaurants that are affordable and in walking distance (just down the hill) so if I get tired of it I can do that or take a 10-15 min drive to get some taco bell/chain meals in the next town over",

Not a problem haha I'm literally just sitting at home all day doing nothing so I don't mind!\n\n1.\t\u2060Can students do research with professors? Does that extend to non-STEM fields?\n\nYes!! A lot of students do summer research, some do it during the school year but usually it's summer research. The summer research program is seen as competitive but it's only hard to get if you don't start early. Express interest to your prof early or mid fall semester the year before (so this fall if you wanted to do it next summer), and you should be fine. Typically it is done in campus but some students travel with profs or on their own depending on the sucject. You also get paid for this! Out of my friends I have one doing research in math, anthropology, Chem, and 3 for physics. Someone last summer did research on memes and another did astrology so there's a wide range. We host a research showcase in the fall the following summer, so there might be some Information online about specifically things people have done! \n\n\n2.\t\u2060What\u2019s Denison\u2019s grad school placement like? Are students generally able to get into their top choice grad school programs?\n\nI'm planning to get a teaching license, but not via gead school so for myself I'm not really sure what the chances are. I have a friend from Denison who majored in anso who is at Berkeley now for grad school, and another at OSU. Lots of people go to med school after as well but I'm not sure the specific stats. \n\n\n\n3.\t\u2060Is it common for OOS students to get merit scholarships?\n\nYes! I'm out of state from Louisiana and I got a very good package. I pay ~$5k a semester and meal plan + room and board and the rest is scholarship + aid. I applied test optional so that won't be an issue since many of my friends did the same and got good packages as well, just make sure you're involved on campus, like have some clubs or a sport smth like that. You don't have to be team captain or a president but just do something other than study. I'd say if you really want to look at costs, check and see what your efc is based on your fafsa as Denison follows it closely for some of my friends. They do reconsider so if you have a chnage in finances from the year you file your fafsa vs what year that fafsa is you can definitely speak with them and work something out. \n\nHopefully these help!! \n\n\n\n\nThanks again! :)Ofc dude glad to help!!

    "postText": "I attended a dinner about this a few days ago. They pitched the idea to a few carefully chosen students to see if there was any demand for this program. The whole idea is that you take a few \"Power and Justice\" courses that are already offered. Then you get involved with some DCA/Service organizations. Then you take two \"Changemaker\" courses. And then you do a senior year portfolio where you reflect on how you will innovate for the common good.\n\n\nThe whole idea is to innovate, contribute to your profession, and be a model citizen. And just do a whole lot of \"good\" in general. In the end, you get a certificate that says you are indeed interested in \"Innovation for the common good\" or you get a \"B.A/B.S/B.F.A In your major with a concentration in Innovation for the Common Good\". \n\n\nSounds great? Or not? What do you think?\n\n\nI feel like this is a good idea being executed in the wrong way. I believe that Denison's academic curriculum should prepare us to innovate and try and bring positive change. We don't an entirely new program to teach this to us, it should be incorporated into what we are already being made to do both inside and outside the classroom. These are essential skills that should be taught to all majors and not only to those people who have the time and electives on hand to do this program.\n\n \nDenison's mission statement says that it strives to churn out \"autonomous thinkers, discerning moral agents and active citizens of a democratic society.\" These are essentially the ideas that are fueling this \"Innovation\" program. I feel that these core ideas should be incorporated in every aspect of life at Denison. There is no need to spend valuable time and money on creating a new program to teach us things that we should already be learning. \n  ",

            "comment": "As we all know the price of college textbooks at this time has become outright extortion. Thus many of us in the industry have taken it upon ourselves to put these companies out of business. So here is a set of links to some resources that will aid you in your education process. Get all the books you can as fast as you can. as I write this publishers are fighting us at every turn and keeping these resources available to the market is getting increasingly difficult. They may not be here tomorrow.\n\nI only ask that you propagate this resource to fellow students and others on the web. This is one thing you can do that will make a big difference. Every book you give to another needy seeker of knowledge takes 100's of dollars of extortion money from the oppressors of knowledge in this world. Given the sheer mass of books sold and the fact that the student unable to 'acquire' books will either be at a disadvantage or be forced to pony up the cash this effort is making a real difference not in just opposing the Corporate takeover of our education system but ensuring education is not a resource available only to the wealthy.\n\nhttp://www.torrentmybooks.com/index.php\n\nhttp://librarypirate.me/?p=home&amp;pid=1\n\nThe Pirata does not ask for your money, only your support, pay it forward.\n",

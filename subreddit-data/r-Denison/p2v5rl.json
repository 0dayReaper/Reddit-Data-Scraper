Rush for freshman usually takes place during the second semester, and there are other rush options during the fall for sophomore and above. \n\nRoughly 30-40% of students are in Greek life, including fraternities and sororities that are traditionally POC. We also have our own frat row from the 20th century before all frats were kicked off campus (Almost all have since been allowed to return, though frat houses are now largely student housing). \n\nI never rushed, but looking back I made a friends with a group of guys in one fraternity and we always wondered if I should have rushed with them. \n\nSo is Greek life necessity to have a social life? Not at all. Is it still a great experience on campus? Absolutely.",

I'd say assume no, as I've never heard of that happening. It'll most likely just take off the cost of housing but not impact your overall out of pocket cost.",

In other words, you\u2019ll save roughly $8,000 per year on housing expenses and receive a small allowance as well. I initially paid $20,000 per year but now it\u2019s around $12,000.\n\nand about Campus jobs, work as much as you want (20 hours per week at most of course), your financial aid won\u2019t change.",

However, I\u2019ve met some people who were form smaller towns than Granville and felt like there was a lot more to do. \n\nEither way, main source of entertainment in Granville will be restaurants and coffee shops, along with Whits",

Getting out of Granville is a lot easier if you have a car or are best friends with someone who does. Columbus is also further away than they say, it\u2019s really like 35-45 min and not 25. Ive never felt confined in a normal year",

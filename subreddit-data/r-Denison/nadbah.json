    "postText": "Hello, I'm an international freshman who will intend to major CS in Denison. I would like to know how the internship oppertunities in Denison (Especially CS department) are. I have heard that there are many people in CS department got the decent internship in Columbus, Cleveland, even in Chicago before their junior year. I believe Denison is a wonderful school, however, I have a little concerns to getting a job.\nWill the international student be given to same internship oppertunity? Is there any disadvantages since I'm international student who needs CPT/OPT Visa? \nAlso, as you all know, Denison is liberal arts university. there are some bias that liberal arts university is hard to get the job. I'm worried that since Denison has lack of alumni, it will be harder to get a job than other big universities. Thank you so much to read it and if you are in CS department or international student in Denison, please comment for me.",

While I am not in the CS department (nor particularly aware of their opportunities), I have been exceptionally pleased with how easy it was to find internships through the school. Handshake is probably your best bet to find internships. And I don't know where you got the idea that Denison has a lack of alumni--we have one of the best networks of alumni in the nation in terms of their activity with current students! Using LinkedIn to connect with alumni in your field is another great way to get yourself rolling with the job market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenerally speaking, from my experience, most of the internships I've applied to have not asked nor required the VISA, but I am not an international student either. Reach out to the Knowlton Center, they are EXTREMELY helpful in helping you find jobs and generally giving advice! I hope this helps somewhat!",

And one more, Do you think Silicon Valley or Big Tech companies evaluate Denison is great school like other prestigious school? I mean is Denison competitive in the job market? I would like to have a job in LA or Chicago in the future. But I'm not sure whether Denison has a great reputation outside of Ohio.",

I quite enjoyed theory of computation, though that\u2019s not a very applicable class so if you\u2019re hell bent on industry it might not be worth taking. Other than that I don\u2019t have any specific recommendations! The department is great, you can\u2019t really go wrong as long as you don\u2019t mess up your course progression.",

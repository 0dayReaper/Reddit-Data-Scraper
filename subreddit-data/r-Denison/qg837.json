    "postText": "Our swim team won THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP last year and yet still more people show up to Jackson Katz' presentation than the pep rally for the reigning champs. We have some real good teams here (girls soccer, girls basketball, mens lacrosse to name a few) but the majority of the campus, as far as I have seen and experienced, doesn't really give a hoot. What is up with that?",

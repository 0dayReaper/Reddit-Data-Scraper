Trees are priced totally standard: $60 8ths (you can usually find $55 8ths and/or $110 quarts), grams are $20. Usually pretty heady. Some people have shroom, molly, LSD, coke connects, but they're usually from nearby Newark or Columbus. Not a particularly druggy school in my experience, mostly it's just alcohol culture with some coke thrown in among the more \"elite\" frats, plus the weed smokers obviously. You'd be extremely lucky if you found someone who could consistently get you DMT or 2C drugs, so by my standards, it's a pretty shitty drug school. Vyvaanse is usually pretty easy to find, if that's your thing, addys are harder, but that's going around everywhere.",

I mean, come on, we're number two with only 14 drug arrests, while number one has 801? Sure, we might have a smaller student body, but still, drug use isn't widespread here.",

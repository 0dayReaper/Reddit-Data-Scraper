I applied for Political Science, but I really want to take classes in Data Analytics and Computer Science. Any recommendations between a MacBook or an iPad(or even a PC or Chromebook)? Also any suggestions on where to buy one? Can't wait to be on the Hill this fall!",

I've done it on a 2015 MBP, but you can't do it on the newest Apple Silicon (m1) Macs. Triple booting might be a little difficult though depending on how much experience one has with tech, and I'm also unaware of anyway to have full-disk encryption on all 3 OSs on a Mac. \n\nIt also pretty much requires an SSD with 512GB of storage or more, and since they're soldered in on some Macs, that could be pricey if you go for a newish one.  \n\nTechnically, you can dual boot on some old Chromebooks (ChromeOS, Windows 10 and some Linux distros), but I haven't seen one built after 2015 that handles it particularly well, though I don't keep up with Chromebook modding news much. I definitely wouldn't go with an iPad though (or any other tablet.)  \n\nAside from Thinkpad, some of Dell's XPS laptops also support some Linux distros ([some even come with Ubuntu pre-installed](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/overview/cp/linuxsystems)), so you could dual-boot Windows and a Linux distro for that.  \n\nBut yeah a Thinkpad, XPS, or old MacBook (if willing to spend some time learning how to triple boot) is probably a good way to go that way you can have both Windows (Office, Adobe CC, etc.) and a Linux distro. Plenty of laptops will run Linux, but not necessarily well (have various driver issues). These 3 brands are pretty good about support.",

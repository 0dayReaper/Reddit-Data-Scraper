    "postText": "Is anyone else having issues with sound on the campus cable?\n\nI recently got a TV for my room, and after running the autoprogramming on setup, I don't get any sound for channels above 28.1. The picture's there, but the sound isn't. I tried running autoprogramming twice more, to no avail. Could it be my TV, a problem right out of the box? Or is it more likely to be a cable service thing?",

The other channels I get are recognized as digital and they work, so I'm not sure what the deal is.\n\nI sent an email to the customer support address I found on Campus Televideo's (I guess that's our provider) website, so hopefully I'll hear something back.",

This is a big one.  \n\n2. If you are caught feeding deer or buzzards, you risk jail time. It's an old Granville law from the late 1800's when the deer population boomed and destroyed farmers crops when locals left out too much food. For some reason cops love to cruise campus at dusk and dawn and see if people are trying to feed the deer.",

You WILL get in trouble for it and you\u2019ll have to take a fire safety class. I myself have taken said class 2 times now (not for hanging stuff lol) and it\u2019s annoying as hell. In fact, avoid anything that\u2019ll get you put in one of those classes, cuz they make you write a paper, and in the middle of the semester it can be a pain to complete alongside academic deadlines.",

In many cases, if a smoke detector goes off in your room you\u2019ll at the very least have to deal with campo. Worst case scenario, the fire department actually comes. Just the other day some girl had a candle that set it off and a whole ass fire truck came to Shep. Also when you\u2019re cooking, make sure there\u2019s an open window. It\u2019s only happened once to me this semester, but sometimes people will set the alarm off from the kitchens and the whole building will have to leave. It\u2019s a pain in the ass.",

This should keep the wick at or below 1/4\u201d. That \u2018mushroom head\u2019 on the wick is what releases all the soot which sets off the smoke alarm. If you do that, you\u2019ll have a candle which burns without sending smoke into the air.",

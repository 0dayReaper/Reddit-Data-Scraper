            "comment": "I\u2019m a Denison alum - while I don\u2019t work in finance, I (for a couple odd months) considered it and did do a reasonable amount of research on where Denison stands relative to other schools. The tl;dr is: Denison isn\u2019t a target for any high comp (read: IB, HFT, hedge funds, etc...) finance fields, but does successfully place students into mid-comp roles. \n\nMore specifically, our Econ program seems to place people into perfectly ok analyst positions at F500s, non-IB analyst positions at JPM/Chase, and (in exceptional cases) big 4 consulting gigs - I know one recent alum who works in PE, but he\u2019s the exception who proves the rule. \n\nTake from that what you will! Finance is, sadly, not very meritocratic and is incredibly pedigree sensitive - if you do want to go into IB or PE or whatever, a target school might be more your speed.\n\nFrom a less careerist perspective though, Denison is awesome and you should totally come. Life isn\u2019t all about squeezing money out of the middle and lower classes through financial engineering, after all :)",

            "comment": "Sorry for the late response, I did work as an IB analyst for a year after graduation before returning to firefighting. As Denison is a liberal arts college, we don't have a dedicated finance program, and most heavy finance information you'll need to know will be self directed.  \n\nAs was mentioned, we do place people in finance roles. I have several friends at top banks and F100s working as financial analysts, but most of their financial work was accomplished through internships or self-directed learning. Almost all of them were economics majors like myself.",

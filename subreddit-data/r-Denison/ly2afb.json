            "comment": "It probably depends on what you want to study and where you want to live: in general, Denison and Skidmore are more highly ranked than Lawrence but that probably doesn't matter all that much unless you're trying to get into med school or something like that.\n\nI've visited all 3 schools (though I went to Denison and my sister goes there now, so I am not unbiased) and they are all pretty nice. Appleton (where Lawrence is) is a small city, Granville (where Denison is) is a small town near a big city (Columbus), Saratoga Springs (where Skidmore is) is a small small city (much smaller than Appleton) but it's pretty close to Albany. Depending on where you have family and how far you want to get away from them, any of those might be an attractive option.\n\nOh and depending on where you're coming from, Denison will have the mildest winter (Lawrence will probably have the harshest) but as long as you'll bundle up, you'll be fine no matter where you go.\n\nGood luck with your decision! Feel free to message me with any questions.",

I\u2019m currently a Junior and I don\u2019t remember much about Skidmore but I enjoy being able to talk to so many different people here who all hold different beliefs and think I\u2019m different ways, I\u2019m not sure I remember Skidmore being like that.  I can\u2019t say much about Lawrence other than I have a friend who goes there and enjoys it, but I can say that Denison is extremely good about communication.  As of today there have been only four cases of COVID on campus and the administration does a fantastic job of keeping everyone up to date on what\u2019s going on.  Parents as well.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to DM me!  I\u2019m a History Major with minors in Classics and Ancient Greek and I sing in an a cappella group but I have friends in almost every department/extracurricular category",

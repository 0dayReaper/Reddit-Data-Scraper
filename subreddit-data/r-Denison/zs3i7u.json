    "postText": "Is there a boxing club or anything boxing related like a gym or something nearby at least? Was hoping to do some boxing if I could. Also, I wanted to know about bands, specifically metal. Are there any bands formed up by students? Do they have concerts and such? How often are there any bands, is it a popular thing? I\u2019m a bit of a metalhead and would like to know if there\u2019s any concerts to go to, or maybe start my own band, as it\u2019s been a dream of mine for a while. Is this much of a thing here or not at all? Thank you for answering any of these questions, I appreciate it. Super looking forward to coming to Denison next fall.",

            "comment": "1) there is a kick boxing club, I am unsure how active they are these days. Last time I checked they were twice a week, I went a couple times and had some fun. Some decently experienced people there. Not sure about combat sports in Granville/Newark but I\u2019m sure you could find something. \n\n2) yes there are bands formed by students, most popular one on campus being the cuties right now. They and other student former bands perform at fraternity parties/formals, IIRC club soccers formal had someone and D-Chi has a massive music festival in October or so that they have student bands play at. However, I doubt you\u2019ll get traction with metal; to be blunt people don\u2019t wanna hear that at parties. If you wanna start a metal band go for it, I\u2019m sure you could find people but you wouldn\u2019t be asked to play anywhere on campus",

There is supposed to be town halls sometime soon where you can ask administrators questions about protocols this year but we haven\u2019t heard anything yet. I imagine they are waiting until the last minute just to get everything right. At June O Weinberg said baring a radical change in the disease there will be no restrictions. However given the progression of delta I can see there possibly being s travel restriction. Maybe some professors would like the students to wear masks in their class, but that\u2019s all I can see being put in place.",

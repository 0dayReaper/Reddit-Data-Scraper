Taking pictures of other people without their explicit consent is one of the major rules regarding naked week and I think it\u2019s safe to say that your track record is indicative of inappropriate behavior for naked week and residing on campus at Denison to begin with",

If you want to participate in naked week as a celebration of body positivity, great. Respect the rules, and participate in possibly the most unique celebration of body positivity I\u2019ve ever participated in or heard of.\n\nBUT if the real reason you\u2019re interested is just because you want to ogle the other participants, take secret photos, or any number of other things that would make other participants uncomfortable, please don\u2019t. Intentional or not, doing these things *would* make the other participants uncomfortable, which goes against the entire purpose of naked week.\n\nTl;Dr - there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with being kinky or into voyeurism, but if you\u2019re going to attend naked week, please leave those feelings/desires at home. This is a chance to celebrate body positivity, not ogle your classmates.",

Pretty sure dates, locations, and themes were published in the Bullsheet as well as shared around Facebook. I don\u2019t think /u/Chiefton and I had made the Denison subreddit yet, otherwise we would have posted it here too. Y\u2019all have fun now, it\u2019s tradition to high-five a security guard with your junk out!",

Most (not all) of the pics I found on the internet already. I would not want to make anyone that participates uncomfortable and it is all about body positivity and acceptance to me. If anything I am more of an exhibitionist than I am a voyeur for what it is worth.",

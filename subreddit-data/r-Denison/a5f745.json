    "postText": "Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that I think I saw a mountain lion in the bio reserve. It was yesterday on the far side of the solar panel field looking north, just before dusk while I was on a run. It was sitting under a fallen tree about 50 feet away looking at me. I just kept running and hoped it wasn't hungry, but I just want to let anyone on campus late at night that they should be alert.",

I think he would have thought the presence of such an animal out there to be really great.",

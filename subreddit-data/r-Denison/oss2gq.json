I\u2019m a rising senior not from US, and I really consider Denison University \nI have watched video about Denison\u2019s soccer team, but I\u2019m not sure if it is up to date, and how realistically it depicts the experience \nIf anyone did play Soccer for Denison, could you pleeease share your experience.",

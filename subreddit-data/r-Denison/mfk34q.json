    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm an international student who just got accepted to Denison for the Spring semester and a waitlist offer for the Fall. I want to ask if there's any benefit for starting college in the Fall, and how should I approach the 200 words waitlist essay: \n\n**Considering your other options for college, we would like to know more about your interest in Denison. Please tell us a little more about why you would like to remain on our fall waitlist.** \n\n  \nIs this basically a \"Why Denison 2.0\", or should I treat it like a LOCI?",

And did you already commit spring offer? I'm wondering if It means I can choose only one between fall waitlist and spring admission",

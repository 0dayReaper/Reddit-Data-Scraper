            "comment": "It's not that great tbh it's the weed dorm which I think is because the vents suck there more than other dorms so you can smell it much easier. I was an RA in shorney last year and had to go to Smith as well to do rounds. Super loud on weekends because of the amount of people that live in the dorm and it's really not that nice but is isn't as bad as others. I'd say it's middle tier first year housing. It's not as quiet as north quad but it's quieter than shorney (not by much). Close to the dining hall and of course a-quad which is nice! The common room isn't that great and the hallways look like they're out of a horror movie imo",

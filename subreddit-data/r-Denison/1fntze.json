    "postText": "**First years**: First of all, Congrats on getting accepted to Denison!\n\nI've created this thread to try to reduce the clutter of several incoming/prospective first-years making threads and to consolidate all the advice. Hopefully this way, we can answer the questions many of you might have without having to make extra threads.\n\nFeel free to ask ANY questions you may have.We know that this is an exciting time, but also confusing and terrifying, so don't hesitate to ask us about anything, and we'll try to answer as honestly as we can. Dorm life, packing list, classes, social life etc etc.\n\nIf you have specific questions regarding majors or minors, /r/denison pretty much has at least one person in each major, so feel free to ask those questions too. \n\nCurrent students: Please contribute any general advice or experiences you'd like to give! No need to wait for a question, since your advice might answer their question beforehand. Also, lets be nice.\n\nPeace,\nVaude",

            "comment": "Been a Dension student for about 2 years now so here are my least and most favorite thing about Denison. \n\n  \n\\------------------\n\n**Least Favourite Things:**  \n1) In dorm rooms, these stink bugs keep on coming inside your room and it's annoying because if you kill them they released a lot of nasty smells so to get rid of them you can either kill them or pick them up and throw them out. Also, watch out for wasps and bees because they do somehow end up inside the room.\n\n2) No one ever f\\*\\*\\*\\*ing flushes the toilet. They would take a massive dump and not flush. Like what?!?!?!?! If you are an upcoming freshman good luck because Shorney is the worse residence hall in my opinion.\n\n  \n3) They don't offer any transportation either than to Walmart or Easton even if you do go to Easton you're supposed to get back to the bus in a certain amount of time which ruins the whole point of going to Easton. They used to offer rental cars however they shut them down due to [\"covid\"](https://imgur.com/a/FjV9Yay) apparently. What bs.\n\n4) The Gym. It's a 20min walk if you are in East Quad(Shorney Hall and etc). Since it's below the Hill you have to put in some extra cardio to get there, imagine doing leg day LOL good luck going up to long freaking stairs.\n\n5) **UBER**. Since Denison is in Granville it's practically a ghost town. Let's say you are an international student and you don't have a car on campus and you want to go to the movie theatre that's in Easton or Columbus. Well, you better time your Uber rides. I shit you not there are **NEVER** any uber rides in Granville. If you are planning to take an uber you better get on 1 hour early or 30 min early. If students are going back home for winter break and you aren't and you have plans to go to the Movie theatre then you better order your UBER like 1-2 hours early. Also if you do have an uber problem people on campus will tell you about Uber Jack, let me just tell you this, he charges 35-45+ USD from Denison -&gt; Easton. Let me tell you this Uber Jack is not the way to use Uber. If you want the cheapest way of getting Ubers to download WeChat and add **ubercaller** this guy gets you, users, for 50% of the price. So if your Uber is 60 USD because of **ubercaller** it's now going to cost you 30 dollars. This guy is a lifesaver I've been using him for 1.5+ years.\n\n6) The people. Teachers, students, everybody. Some of them are nice, some of them are dickheads, and some of them do things that if I say I will prob be banned. Make sure to hang out with the right people. \n\n7) Dorm Parties. I swear to god every day there is some idiot having a party in their dorm room blasting trash music from the morning till night. This happened once and I told my community advisor about it, they literally didn't even do anything about the issue. Some CA's take their job seriously and some of them are just abusing the role to get a free single room.\n\n8) If you have the Dension Dollars form of Meal Plan then good luck with enjoying food from Slayter because their prices are **TOO HIGH**. 3.75 for a singular monster drink like what is that BS. Lucky for me I have Big Red so I didn't have to really deal with the Denison Dollars but even with 130 Denison Dollars, I'm limited to a couple of items.\n\n9) Roommates. I just want to let you know this, and this will save your life!!! The person you meet at the beginning of the year might act all nice but as the month progresses their true colors start to come out. So even if housing says to stay with your roommate even if you don't like the person see how the relationship will turn out. Do what you think is best. In my first year I had a roommate who would moan and sing out loud 24/7 for no f\\*\\*\\*ing reason, he would do it when I would call my family or when I'm talking with my friends on Discord, the guy was an absolute ass. And I couldn't switch roommates because time was up since housing gave me the shitty advice. just **trust your gut**.\n\n  \n10) Laundry Rooms. I swear to god, people need to understand that if you put laundry in the machine and your laundry is done **REMEMBER TO TAKE YOUR LAUNDRY AND DONT LEAVE IT IN THE MACHINE.** The amount of machines that have clothes left in them and just sitting for hours is so annoying. Tip of advice, if this happens to you, take their clothes out of the machine and leave them on the table, it's their fault their lazy ass took 10 years to come back to the machine.\n\n  \n\\------------------  \n\n\n**Most Favourite Things:**  \n1) The food omfg. Curtis although people say their food is pretty repetitive, the dessert bar and the ice cream bar and the waffle bar and the deli bar and everything else is just amazing. Just be careful because **YOU WILL GAIN WEIGHT IF YOU DONT WATCH OUT**. \n\n2) The teachers are amazing. I major in Computer Science and the CS Professors are just a \\**chef kiss\\** they are amazing. Literally, almost every teacher on this campus is amazing and you can even make friends with most professors even if you don't have their class. Trust me, make friends with your professor, and attend their office hours. It will be the best decision you ever made in your college life.\n\n3) The tutoring service they provide is pretty good. If you ever need help you can just get a tutor for **FREE**. The tutors are mainly students who excel at the subject and even have gotten a referral from their professors so you can trust them.\n\n4) Notebowl is amazing, the UI, and the simplicity of going through the website are amazing. It sucks that apparently they are getting rid of Notebowl for the FALL 2022 semester but hopefully something better is used. Hopefully, it's not blackboard.\n\n  \n5) The community of people is hilarious at times. If you don't have the app I recommend downloading YikYak you can see what everybody is talking about on-campus and you can send msgs anonymously. It's pretty much a Reddit copypasta.\n\n  \n6) The events. Denison pays **A LOT** of money for the big events that happen at the very beginning of the semester and other days in the semester. The events are really good to attend but it sucks going there if you don't have any friends. Lol story of my life :)\n\n  \n7) Clubs. There are many, My top 2 clubs are Anime Club and Gaming Guild. In Anime club you watch anime that is voted upon by the audience. In Gaming Guild you play board games and around 8 pm EST, there is a social event that happens with everyone that is at Gaming Guild. They have Guild every Thursday and Saturday but people barely show up for Thursdays, Saturdays are when it gets **CRAZYYYYY**.\n\n8) The Scenery. Although it's a small campus IMO, there are some spots where you can really breathe in and out and just admire the place.\n\n9) The WIFI. I gotta say the Wifi is literally **GOD LIKE.** I don't know what service provider they use but I have never had any problems with the WIFI. Its literally so freaking fast.\n\n10) Safety. Literally everywhere especially at night time, there are the campus police that monitor the campus to make sure the students are safe. At times I have been up until 4 am and walking around campus I just feel safe. They also do provide more safety for females as they do provide a phone number to call and even have poles where you touch the button and it sends an alert to the campus police.\n\n  \n\\------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, those are my most and least favorite things at Denison. I guarantee you there is more stuff that could go on the list but my small brain can't think of anymore. I hope this information helped in any way! Have a nice day \\^\\_\\^",

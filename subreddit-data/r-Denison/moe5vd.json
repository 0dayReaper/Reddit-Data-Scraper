    "postText": "How are the dorm rooms at Denison University? I'm scared that if I go with multiple dorms then my dorm roommate might be a total jerk or something but there is also a chance that my roommate might be a completely nice person. Can anyone give me their reviews of their dorm life, because right now I'm leaning toward the single dorm rooms.",

            "comment": "Dorm life is actually pretty neat. You get a new friend right away. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you can transfer to a single or a new double or triple.\n\nIt is a learning process though. Each of you will be learning to live in a small room with another person. Setting clear rules of behavior at the beginning is key, and also keeping the lines of communication open throughout the year. Very rarely will your freshmen roommate be your roommate through the next 3 years, but you\u2019ll find your group and and use your skills that you honed with your first roommate to make sure you\u2019re not the jerk.\n\nThe whole living in dorms and leaning to live with others is part of the Denison experience.",

            "comment": "I couldn\u2019t recommend LESS the idea of getting a single. It\u2019s more expensive, gives you a much greater incentive to stay in your room, and lacks the fun concept of just getting paired with some dude you\u2019ve never met before, which is a super cool life experience. I was very lucky to become best friends with my random roommate from freshman year, and I lived with him up until the end, but that\u2019s pretty rare. \n\nWhen I was a sophomore I was an RA and had a single dorm room because of that, and man did I hate it. Now, I\u2019m a pretty introverted guy- I love my alone time and the idea of keeping my space how I like- but the positives of living alone did not outweigh the negatives. Not only did it incentivize me to always be in my room because I could be alone and do what I want, but it also made it much harder to maintain connections with my friends. There\u2019s a part of living alone where your introvert-ness can almost consume you and actually negatively impact you a little. My case isn\u2019t the same for everybody at all, but all of my RA friends expressed the same kinds of concerns that I had. \n\nAnywho, get a roommate. If it doesn\u2019t work for you, you can live alone the next 3 years, but you have your entire life to live alone so there\u2019s no need to rush it:)",

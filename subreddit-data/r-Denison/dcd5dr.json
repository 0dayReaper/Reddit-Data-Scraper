How\u2019s the strength of the Arabic program and the PPE program? How big is it? \n\n3. How\u2019s intellectual life on campus? Is Denison truly the place where students have intellectual conversations outside the classroom, to what extent?  \n\n4. How good is merit aid? \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "For numbers 2 and 4 speak to the admissions office for information, they have more detailed info. 98% of students are on merit or need based aid, average tuition cost per semester ranges in the $20K - $30K. PPE is a strong program as well, students go on from that to Law School, Econ PhDs, the big 4, and so on. PM me if you want more information on the other questions.",

            "comment": "1. Less than it should be. Denison is much more inclusive in recent decades than it was historically, but Greek life is still the biggest social influence. That said, there are plenty of independent clubs with welcoming communities.\n2. Can't speak directly on either. I don't believe Arabic is itself a major, but I could be wrong. Being so small though means that it may not feel as robust as a larger department. PPE is extremely popular among pre-law students and seems to be very well-regarded.\n3. Your mileage will vary greatly. In my experience, people with similar enthusiasm about their majors and other intellectual topics group together, so if you make friends with like-minded people you should be fine. Denison brings in lots of public guest lecturers for every department and they are always open to everyone, so you shouldn't be bored.\n4. The merit aid lives up to the hype. I see in your account that you're applying to a bunch of well-endowed schools, and Denison is probably close to the top tier of them. Basically every student gets at minimum a third taken off sticker price.\nDM me if you have any other questions!",

How big is it?  shoot me a dm I am in Arabic, it is very very good as of right now. I also came in as a PPE but switch to another major, My exposure to the program was very positive.\n3. How\u2019s intellectual life on campus? Is Denison truly the place where students have intellectual conversations outside the classroom, to what extent? honestly, it's pretty good in my opinion, that being said it's very much up to who you make friends with. I feel like most of the school events around discussion have gone poorly. \n4. How good is merit aid? idk",

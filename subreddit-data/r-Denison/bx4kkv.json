    "postText": "Researchers from The Ohio State University are studying how to inform hookah users about the health effects of hookah.\u00a0\n\nIndividuals who are between ages 18 and 29 and who have used hookah at least once in the past are eligible to participate.\u00a0\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete surveys and view pictures of hookah pipes on a computer that tracks their eye movements for about 30 minutes. They will then be asked to complete a 10-minute phone survey about a week later.\u00a0 Participants who complete the study will receive up to $30 in cash for the in-person session and a $10 store card for the phone survey.\u00a0\n\nPlease call or email our study staff to learn about the project:\u00a0\n\n (614) 758-3053\u202c  \n \n\n[OSU.Waterpipe.Study@gmail.com](mailto:OSU.Waterpipe.Study@gmail.com)",

But can anyone help me with two questions I have?\u00a0\u00a0\n1- some people online make it sound like Denison has a pretty big community of frat/Red Pill guys, more than a some other liberal arts colleges.\u00a0\u00a0Is that true?\u00a0I\u2019m open to a community with a lot of different points of view but I\u2019m from California:) \n\u00a02- how is the environmental science program?\u00a0\u00a0I was really impressed online and on in my in-person tour, but it\u2019s ranked pretty low by Niche.\u00a0Thanks so much for your help!",

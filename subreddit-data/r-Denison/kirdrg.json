    "postText": "Hello everyone! I'm planning to apply for ED2 at Denison. Since EDs are binding, so Denison is my first choice. I prefer this university more than the other ones because of its location (not too far from the city, yet far from a distracting city life, and also on top of a hill). Also I'm an international student, with my family income less than $45,000 (around $6000), so I'd also apply for a financial aid, with work-and-study program. It's my dream to study in US, so I'm taking it as a challenge knowing that I can't afford any University at US.\n\nSo here's how my profile looks like:\n\nCourse: Bachelors of Science, Major in Computer Science\n\nAge: 19\n\n+++ *Extracurriculars* +++\n\nProfessional Experiences:\n\n-&gt; Lead Software Developer at an IT company, for the past 8 months.

Went to many events that help poor and needy people by giving them stuff that they'd need daily (like medicines, etc)\n\n-&gt; Member of an NGO which helps grassroot Athletes. I was an interviewer, content writer and I used to do counselling sessions. \n\n-&gt; Software developer at an Non Profit Organization which educates people about Climate changes, and how to save the environment. I'm making a mobile app for them like Khan Academy where they could do various free courses on the same.\n\n-&gt; I'm one of the founders of a Non Profit Organization, that takes donations for planting trees. \n\n+++ *Academics and Other Qualifications* +++\n\n-&gt; Overall Score:\n\n9th grade: 85% \n\n10th grade: 88%\n\n11th grade: 65%\n\n12th grade: 75%\n\n-&gt; Computer Science score:\n\n9th grade: 98%\n\n10th grade: 95%\n\n11th grade: 100%\n\n12th grade: No exam due to COVID19.\n\n(Idk how to calculate GPA and what GPA is accepted in Denison.)\n\n-&gt; SAT without Essay: 1320\n\n-&gt; No AP exams taken.\n\n-&gt; Senior Diploma in Fine Arts.\n\n+++  *Awards* +++\n\n-&gt; School topper till 10th grade.

My grades went down because of a reason, also will it matter a lot in the application? But SAT score lies within the score range they listed in the website, that is 1200-1410, so will my school grades still matter a lot?",

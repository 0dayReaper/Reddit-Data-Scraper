Since they're both LAC's in Ohio, I'm assuming a similarity in cultures (pls correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure a good lot of you have been exposed to both these schools and I'd like to know which one you'd go for! \n\nCost- about the same, but I'd be 15k in debt if I choose to go to Kenyon \n\nI'm planning on grad school after undergrad, so any insight into kids from denison going into the ivies for grad school will be much appreciated! \n\nMerci d'avance!\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who chipped in w their views! Much appreciated!",

            "comment": "So I was making this decision in about 2008. So take it with a grain of salt that it's been some time since my experience. I would choose Denison hands down over Kenyon every time for a couple of reasons.\n\n1. When I went to visit Kenyon everyone was too serious to be perfectly honest. At Denison people were friendlier, happier, more outgoing. I felt like a lot of people at Kenyon got really stuck on the school's academic reputation and felt a little holier than thou.\n\n2. The Denison alumni network will win out over kenyon's time after time and my experience. Granted I did decide to make Central Ohio home after graduating Denison, so my sample is skewed. But Denison has made huge efforts to engage their alumni community and bring meaningful experiences like continuing education and employment help for alumni. \n\n3. In terms of your desire to go to graduate school, the major you're choosing might matter a little bit between schools, but overall most graduate schools are looking at not just the name of your school, but your recommendation letters, your course work, and research/internships. I'm not as sure about kenyon, but Dennison has long-standing intentional research opportunities for undergraduates that are paid. I went to graduate school at a top 10 ranked public administration and policy program, and the meaningful relationship that I had with my faculty enabled them to write compelling letters of recommendation which I believe were the reason I got into grad school. It definitely wasn't my GPA.\n\n I do think that your student loan that is something to consider as well. your financial aid package can change over the years if you received different scholarships or grants or if your family's financial situation changes. But knowing that at Kenyon you're likely to pay $15,000 more would definitely cause me to pause. Just about everyone is graduating with student loan debt, but if you can minimize it between two fairly equal choices, I would recommend doing so. \n\nBest of luck!",

Denison wasn't my first choice tbh but I ended up really enjoying my time there and look back on it fondly.",

There's people that fit that \"small liberal arts college\" stereotype, but plenty that don't.\n\nThere are sports and Greek life, but I was not a part of either and I still had a wide circle of friends with tons of different interests. There are parties on the weekends like other posters said, but clubs and other organizations usually have lots of other events going on that aren't necessarily parties (and have been quite fun in my experience). If you're comparing to Kenyon, there really is nothing going on in Gambier, Ohio (where Kenyon is located). Granville is small, but it has a number of restaurants and some things to do. It's also closer to Columbus, and a popular weekend spot for students (pre-covid) is going to Easton, a massive shopping village for movies and restaurants.",

Of course, that's because the Denison culture was one where I fit in much better compared to Kenyon. \n\nWhat really matters is where *you* feel you fit in best. Both schools will give you a top quality education, rivaling the top LACs. Both will set you up for success, and both will allow you to develop and grow into a mature and improved version of you. However, if you pick either one because of metrics and you don't gel, you won't succeed. I vibed with Denison over Kenyon. And I have friends who ended up picking Kenyon and excelled as well.  \n\nDenison will give you better financial aid though.",

    "postText": "Hello Denisonians, I am a prospective Denison ED applicant. I have completed my application but I am left with finances.  I can easily pay from $10k to $15k and I have asked the office about my admission with aid to which they mentioned possible.  Now, I have been wondering what amount to mention in CoF form since Denison takes that amount as EFC for international students. I have planned to pay 50% of my EFC through parental contribution and 50% through bank education loan from India.  So, here's the reason I have been debating the amount.  \n$10k=800k INR  \n$11k=900k INR   \n$12k=1000k INR   \n$13k=1100k INR   \n$14k=1200k INR   \n$15k=1250k INR   \nThese are the conversion. I have been majorly debating between 12k and 15k since the difference is significant over the period of 4 years.  \n\nCan you guys provide me insights into this amount through your personal experience or your friends (international students)? \n\nHere is my [chanceme post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/xxtpdn/chance_an_educationfrench_major_intl_needing_aid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nThank You in advance:)",

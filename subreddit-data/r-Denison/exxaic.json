But after spending a year here, I can honestly say that it hasn't been worth traveling far from home and dealing with the terrible weather. There is not a united sense of community here. Yes, you will find the large majority of people here privileged Greeks, but there are hipsters, intellectuals, nerds and any other category you can think of. The issue is that groups don't interact. If you (like me) can't be categorized by these limiting categories, it's very difficult to find friends here. Honestly, the social scene here seems more stereotypical \"high school\" than my high school experience was. The classroom experience isn't much better because there is a competitiveness amount students that doesn't match up to the academic expectations here.\n\nhow much do you agree? Do you feel you fit in one of those categories?",

That type of life is pretty prevalent.  \n\nThere\u2019s an ongoing effort for groups to mix, as that is a problem on campus, so with that, it can seem like high school sometimes. But really I\u2019d be hard pressed to find a school the same size as Denison who doesn\u2019t have this problem.\n\nI can speak on some other things too if you have questions",

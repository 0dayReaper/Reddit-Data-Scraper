    "postText": "If you were unsure of your career before denison, figured it all out in the university, and then studied mechanical engineering through the \"3-2\" engineering program, please answer the following.\n1. How did you decide to study mechanical engineering? What did you go through?\n2. Who helped you decide to study ME ( professors? If so name them, career center?)\n3. Do few people use the 3-2 program? Is it hard? Why?\n4. Who is your favourite physics professor and why\n5. Any warnings or anything to say to prospective international students who might want to study engineering through the 3-2 program, but unsure and want to explore other fields of study?\nPlease feel free to add anything you'd like to talk about.\nP.s. i am new to reddit, please correct me if i broke any rules that i dont know of ( if there are any)\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I was not in the physics program, but I had two friends who initially enrolled in the 3-2 program with an intention to finish at Columbia or WashU. They told me of all the students in the program, very few continued on to leave Denison after their three years. The reason: they didn't want to leave their friends they had made during the first three years. In addition, they all had only great things to say about their professors as well. Most of those who entered the 3-2 ended up finishing with a physics major and going on to a Masters / PhD program. \n\nDon't worry about not exploring other fields of study. Denison is a Liberal Arts college so in order to complete the 3-2 program you still must take classes in a [wide variety of studies](https://denison.edu/academics/curriculum/general-education-program) including: Humanities, Languages, Social Science, Fine Arts. I ended up double majoring in Biology and Economics after I took an Econ 101 class just to fulfill a GE requirement.\n\nIf you're not sure what you want to study don't worry. Denison doesn't require you to declare a major until after your Sophomore year, which means by then you have taken on average 16 classes in a wide variety of subjects.",

I still get lunch with old friends from college weekly, and my best friend was my roommate for 3 years. Everyone has a different experience, but many make friends for life.",

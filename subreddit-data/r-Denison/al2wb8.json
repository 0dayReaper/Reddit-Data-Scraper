    "postText": "Camp Kesem is a nationwide organization dedicated to help support kids impacted by a parent\u2019s cancer. When Professor Sue Davis passed away from cancer early in 2018, the loss touched all of us at Denison. Empathizing with her family increased our awareness of the devastating effect that a parent\u2019s cancer has on children, and made us aware of the amazing work done through Camp Kesem. When we brought up the idea of starting a chapter to our campus, we were overwhelmed by the amount of support and enthusiasm shown by our faculty, students, and local community. Unfortunately, cancer is prolific in our society and all too often the children of adults who have passed away from, or are currently afflicted with cancer are left to cope with the devastation wrought by cancer all by themselves. If you or someone you know, with kids, has cancer or has passed away from cancer you should let them/their loved ones know about Camp Kesem. It's 100% free and an amazing support system that can make all the difference in these young kids lives(they take kids from ages 6-18).\n\nGo to cast your vote for Denison at https://vote.campkesem.org and as long as we maintain a top 5 position we are eligible. Please note that it\u2019ll take a bit after you vote to receive an email for you to confirm your choice. Your support is greatly appreciated.",

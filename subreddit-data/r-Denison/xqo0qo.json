Otherwise, I can\u2019t pinpoint the other location clues. \n\nI\u2019d love to send these back to the family in the video but need help doing so! Let me know if you recognize anyone or any place, or if you have any suggestions or know of any good subs for this. \n\nThank you!",

A common confusion, we are Denison University, a small liberal arts college in Granville, Ohio.  \n\nThis looks like great film, I would recommend starting your search with Denison's City hall (903-465-2720). I would see if they have some office for town records, they may be able to help. Best of luck!",

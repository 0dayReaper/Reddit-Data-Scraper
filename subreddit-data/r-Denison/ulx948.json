    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an international student. I enrolled at Denison and will be attending next term. I need to have a medical professional complete my wellness examination form in order for me to continue my enrollment process, and my medical provider is supposed to provide my immunization history but the thing is that they don\u2019t keep this on their records. I used to have the certificates but I lost them in a flood. Does anyone else have had this situation where they didn\u2019t know how to provide the proof of their immunization or know another international students who has gone through this process and could perhaps help me? \n\nThanks a lot in advance.",

For those doses that are still missing, just get an additional shot. The whole process should only take a few days at most.",

    "postText": "I plan on applying to Denison and I have some questions. Before that, here's some background info- I'm an intl. applicant from India and I'm applying test-optional. My school gives a GPA out of 100 (and mine is 84.84).\n\n1. I saw that the overall acceptance rate of Denison is 27% which is way too low for someone like me (I know I can apply ED II but I don't have my hopes high after getting rejected from Grinnell College ED I) I need financial aid and I'm not so confident about my profile, so should I even apply RD?\n2. Any suggestions?\n\nI would greatly appreciate candid and detailed answers. Thank you for reading this and please answer if you can :)",

Denison cares more about your uniqueness and what you can bring to the table rather than what your grades are. Take the chance you will be fine. Be unique and most importantly be yourself, because there is only one you in the whole world.",

            "comment": "Dude just apply. I got in by not submitting my SAT scores and my GPA was 3.6 i believe. In my opinion the most important thing about your chance of acceptance is your College Essay. I wrote about League of Legends, Minecraft, Ironman and related all to how this drives my passion to Computer Science. They wrote a note when I got accepted and said they loved the essay. Don't worry too much, make sure to have back up schools and make sure to express yourself in your college essay. Also the grants this school gives you ARE CRAZY!!! my tuition was originally 80k but with grants my tuition dropped to 20k so now I pay around 7k per semester. I also recommend to invest in the Big Red meal plan if you do get accepted it's a 100 dollar difference and you get unlimited meals in Huffman and Curtis.\n\nCurtis &gt; Huffman",

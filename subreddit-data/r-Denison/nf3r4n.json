    "postText": "I have heard that Denison University, and other two schools are now official Questbridge partners. Will it make them increase denison's rank? (for example, on US news, QS) I think Denison is apparently underrated even though their output of graduated school and employment have been so good. What do you think? Will Denison increase their ranking?",

Don't go to a school because of rankings\u2013\u2013you'll just end up sad and bitter.",

Find the school that best fits your interests and whose culture you vibe the best with. Straight As from Denison are better than straight Cs from Harvard.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm sorry if this has been addressed before, but right now I'm choosing between Denison and UW Madison. Both verryyy different schools. I was just wondering why Denison? And with a school so small, is it cliquish? Do certain groups \"rule\" or stand out on campus? Do you regret picking Denison? Is everyone up in everyone else's business? Thank you so much and I appreciate any/all answers, insight, etc. :)",

I picked Denison because I was excited to go to a school where people listened to each other and didn\u2019t get upset when someone had a view that was different from theirs (politically speaking).  I find that almost everyone on campus is extremely friendly and it isn\u2019t cliquey at all, I have friends in many different groups across campus.  Feel free to message me if you have any questions.",

While they are both different, their effect on the human body is rather pleasant. You should try sometime. Denison is absolutely litty and I think you just have to open up. Also have never experienced or witnessed people opening doors in the middle of the night or people trashing the hallways.",

Greek life and party culture are very prominent on campus.\n\nI do not regret picking Denison. Although I do not party and I'm not affiliated with a Greek life organization, I've still found a lot of great friends from classes, clubs, sports, and mutual friends. Everyone at college wants to have friends, so people are very accepting.\n\nEveryone is up to eachother's business, meaning drama gets around pretty quickly when it happens.\n\nBetween those 2 schools, I don't think you can make a bad choice.",

            "comment": "If you want to hear negatives, I can definitely help with that. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love this school but sometimes it just rubs me the wrong way. Currently the worst part about Denison is the lack of air conditioning in most of the dorms. If you\u2019re one of the (un)lucky people with a condition like asthma u can get a window unit, but be ready to be hit with HEAT at move in. Ohio gets really hot in the summer, and ur dorm can become a swamp. Invest in some fans. \n\nAnother thing is the size. Specifically in regards to people. Sure, it can be nice to see the same people all the time and always meet somebody you know at a party, but when you piss someone off you WILL see them everywhere. And if there\u2019s somebody you don\u2019t like, you\u2019ll most likely see them at least once a week outside of class.",

The Knowlten Center is great and you\u2019ll become best friends with some of your professors. Several of my friends routinely go out for drinks with one of their (now retired) professors. The relationships across the board are fantastic. \n\nA negative that Denison doesn\u2019t tell a lot of students is that Denison is kind of in the middle of no where. We are no 25 minutes from Columbus, it\u2019s more like 40-45. If you have a car it\u2019s great and not really a problem, but.",

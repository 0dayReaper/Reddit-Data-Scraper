Gotta wonder if it'd be possible to drop an atom bomb on that dumpsterDenison without annihilating any other surrounding cities or states (with the exception of OKLAHOMA...bc who'd actually object to decimating that anal-sore syphilitic pit of \ud83d\udca9 state? \ud83e\udd14 NOBODY). The only drawback from atomizing Denison,  tx is that all those human cockroaches would of course survive and use the extra space to procreate more diseased human roach Denison demon trash babies.",

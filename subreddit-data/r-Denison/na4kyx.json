    "postText": "Hi. I wanted to go Denison next fall, but I'm taking a gap year and applying next year. I'm really concerned about the apparent lack of hot girls at the school from touring, and as a person with a high sex drive, I fear that quality hookups will be few and far between because of the campus size, students I've met, and the general vibe at the school. I know this is not-pc, but it's a legitimate question and this is the only place I feel I can ask it honestlt without being judged. Thanks.",

IMO Denison has a student body of above-average attractiveness and I never had issues with hookups while there, but that's not the point. Denison is also a school where intellectual curiosity, emotional intelligence, empathy, and respect for others are important, and it doesn't sound like that's a primary focus for you.\n\nI agree with /u/I_wanna_ask. Go to Miami or something, haha.",

Got backstage in Denver because I knew the opener and got free tickets to Cleveland because I bought the bassist argyle socks (which he wore during the show). Going to the show on 8/3 in Detroit and hopefully something amazing will happen that'll top all that off!",

I heard he'd be opening instead of Danny, so I started listening to his stuff (he's pretty good!) and tweeting back and forth with him maybe 4 months before the show. Then tweeted the day of saying I was gonna be there, asked if I could get \"hooked up to hang out with you guys\", and he was like \"hell yeah\", texted me and came outside. Hooked me up with one of these! He's a great guy for sure.\n\nI did get to meet Donald, but my conversation senses froze up at the sight of my idol (if you can't tell by now, I'm a huge fan) and it wound up being a short \"I'm a big fan, thanks for making music\". He signed my vinyl and CD and disappeared to the tour bus. Now Ludwig was a fantastic guy! Came up to *me* and introduced himself. Great night !",

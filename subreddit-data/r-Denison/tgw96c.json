    "postText": "Hey y'all, I got into Denison for spring, waitlisted for fall, and I have a couple of questions regarding my acceptance. \n\n1) The fall semester is the most famous, and most of the class enters in the fall, I'm worried that I won't be able to make friends if I come in the spring since most people make friends in their first week, and that'll be done in fall.\n\n2) I got an estimated fin aid offer of 54.4k, leaving me to pay 20k (which is my efc), however, the letter states that ***All awards are estimated until you submit your enrollment deposit and complete all financial aid requirements.*** So does this mean that there is a chance my fin aid will decrease? I can only submit all my fin docs after enrolling, but if my aid decreased after enrollment then that'll be a big problem.\n\n3) because of my worry stated in point 1, I'm thinking about accepting a place on the waitlist for fall, so how likely is it that I'll end up getting in for this fall instead of spring? \n\nThank you for reading this and please help answer my concerns, thank you!",

            "comment": "You should not let the fall/spring thing bother you too much. It's not like everyone meets everyone the first week and doesn't make friends after that. \n\nnevertheless, i could totally see the desire to want to start as soon as possible, especially if you dont have interesting things planned during the fall. But it is early enough to get something in the works. If i were you, i would much prefer to start in the spring for many reasons. \n\nOne, you can develop some interesting hobbies and interests between now and then. Read some and figure out more clearly what you want out of your college experience. \n\nTwo, you'll be able to work some and save some money. Everyone loves the new guy that buys springs for a round of drinks or pitches in for a tank of gas within a scowl. \n\nthree, you wont waste quite as much time during the first semester phony show. Not that anyone is particularly at fault, but the first semester of college can be a very bizarre time, with people trying on personalities and having no idea how they actually want to act. By second semester it'll be easier to see which people are actually your kind of people and who you want to hang out with because they wont be quite to wacked out in pretending they are someone they are not just to look cool or make friends.\n\nIf you really want to go to denison as opposed to some other place, then dont worry about the semester gap at all. Heck, you could even do a gap year program and (if you can put together some money) go to some interesting location and work on a service learning project for a couple months.",

And don\u2019t worry about making friends, You will make friends a long the way. Your fin-aid shouldn\u2019t decrease also actually Denison gives out a shit load of money in their grants so you should be fine. 20k per sem is the average tuition everyone on campus is paying atm.",

My roommate on the other hand is from Japan and he pays around 20k per semester which is crazy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day it depends on how much you get from grants and scholarships which will result in your final tuition cost",

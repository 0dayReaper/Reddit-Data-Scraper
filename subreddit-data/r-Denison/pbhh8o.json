    "postText": "Where is the best place to post off campus jobs for Denison students? \n\nFlyers around campus? Flyers at local businesses? Somewhere online? (I have the job posted on Facebook, but applicants have been sketchy).\n\nI reached out to Denison directly but never got a response.\n\nFor context, I am a small business owner that lives near campus. I am looking to employ someone a few hours a week, with the opportunity for more hours if desired. Flexible schedule. Independent work. I think it would be perfect for a college student looking for some extra money and a flexible schedule.",

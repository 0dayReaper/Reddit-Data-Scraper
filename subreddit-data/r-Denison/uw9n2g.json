I really enjoyed living in a place where I could go to the party but come back to a quieter and cleaner space. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be the same way next year but I think it was a good thing to consider. However I honestly don\u2019t think that it truly matters which dorm you\u2019ll live in in the greater aspect, all of them were renovating recently and have pretty much the same amenities",

            "comment": "Your three basic picks are Shorney, Smith, and Crawford.  Shorney and Smith are on West Quad which is closer to academic buildings and the center of campus while Crawford is on East Quad, which is further from the center of campus.  On West Quad you\u2019ll have more opportunities to interact with other first years and you\u2019ll be closer to senior and frat parties.  East Quad is where the majority of sophomores and juniors are so you might spend time with more people outside your year.  It really comes down to your personal preference",

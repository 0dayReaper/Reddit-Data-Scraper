    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m an international applicant from Vietnam. I registered for an interview on Dec 30th. Close to that date, my interviewer emailed me and said that they wanted to reschedule the interview due to a time conflict. It was also unfortunate that a family member of mine tested positive for COVID during that time as well. So I didn\u2019t want to interview because I was feeling unwell. I suggested that the interview be Jan 2nd because it\u2019s gonna be after new year\u2019s eve. This was when we ran into more time conflict because he is only available at either 7 AM or 1 AM in my time zone. He said that I can wait until all the senior interviewers are back to have more time options, but I\u2019m kinda worried that having an interview that late would make me look bad to the university. I expressed this concern with him but he didn\u2019t reply to emails anymore. \n\nWill doing an interview this late harm my chances of admission? Also, I want to change application round from RD to ED2 because I really like Denison. Will the interview on Jan 17th be counted in my ED2 application? \n\nThank you!!",

I never did an interview for my application process and got in. I wish you the best of luck, the interview is just a process so they can get to know you better. Hope you have a great day and get into whatever school you think is best!",

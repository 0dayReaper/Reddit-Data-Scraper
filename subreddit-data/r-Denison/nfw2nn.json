            "comment": "Hey welcome to Denison! As far as clubs go, literally whatever you like to do as far as hobbies go there\u2019s a club for you: photography, gaming, community service, sustainability, like there\u2019s a lot. My favorite club was the September Committee, who are in charge of September Fest (a party dedicated to the song September by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire), but I\u2019m pretty bias. \n\nAs far as graduating early goes, just hope you got 4s &amp; 5s on all your APs and be prepared to spend semesters taking 5 classes (the norm is 4), and many various 1 credit classes. If this is something you\u2019re keen on doing, make sure your advisor knows as soon as the two of you meet in August. \n\nMust sees/dos? Hmmm- it\u2019s a small campus but with enough intuition it can become quite the large place to explore. The bio reserve (an off-campus park with various nature trails) has a lot to be explored. It\u2019s located just across from the East Gate, you can\u2019t miss it. Every building has its story- and knowing them is pretty crucial in finding secrets. I say that like there some serious secrets to be found, but there are little fun thing to learn about what buildings use to serve as, and the people they\u2019re named after. For example, the English/Envs building has a roof to be explored (be very careful please), an awkwardly placed shower to find, and history of what it was used for to be discovered. There\u2019s tunnels under campus that with the right blueprints from the basement of the library you can find. And lastly, just about every dorm room has secrets left by former residents that are very fulfilling when you discover them. Beta House has a cool attic and a former senators residence to explore, and Taylor has a really cool secret room within one of the residencies with notes from former explorers who have also found it. Throughout all my 4 years there I was always discovering new things about the campus we all lived at. \n\nHave fun and just explore! Feel free to DM anytime for other recs n stuff.",

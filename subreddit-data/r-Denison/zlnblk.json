    "postText": "Hi! I have been very into Denison University these last few days. I heard that it has a great party scene, great professors, and a friendly environment! But I guess I have more chances to get admitted into Bryn Mawr. I won't submit SAT scores and my first priority is finaid, and I'm not really sure about finaid at Denison since I'm an international student, but I'm pretty guaranteed that Bryn Mawr will meet them, even though I don't want to go there. Any help?",

Demonstrated interest is very important and it\u2019s a beautiful university. My daughter has been accepted I would apply to both.\nThis way you have strategized but also way your options.",

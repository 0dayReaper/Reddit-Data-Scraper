    "postText": "What is pre med like at Denison? Is there a good matriculation rate to good med schools (like top 75). Also does the school provide great support and research for pre med students. \n\nThe vibe I felt when I visited campus was that it was very liberal arts which is great because I\u2019m interested in the performing arts as well, however, I am very serious getting accepted into medical school\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I want to state first and foremost: I am currently a medical student at Dartmouth, having graduated from Denison in 2016. If I had attended another college, I am not sure I could have gotten into medical school given how much support Denison offered me during my time at school, and when I decided to apply even as an alumni. Applying to medical school is a brutal process, less than half of all applicants end up getting accepted every year.   \n\nBut I want to clarify a common misconception. \"Liberal Arts\" is not like \"arts\" in high school. Yes it does encompass things such as sculpture, dance, theatre etc... but the term \"Liberal Arts\" is the description of an Academic Tradition dating back to the ancient Greeks. This primarily revolves around the following subjects: hard sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. Another core concept to a liberal arts education is focusing on \"critical thinking\" and being well rounded. You are required to take courses from other disciplines in order to have a basic understanding of humanities, language, science, and art. My favorite classes from undergrad were probably my Roman Art History and Creative Writing courses. Both were intellectually challenging but incredibly enlightening. In fact, I use what I learned in both of those courses nearly every day in medical school.  \n\nDenison offers bachelor degrees in most STEM fields including: chemistry, biochemistry, biology, psychology, physics, mathematics, computer science, as well as minors and concentrations in many other specialties including neuroscience and astronomy. These science classes meet, and often exceed, the same rigor demanded from Universities and other programs.  \n\nDenison has a phenomenal track record of getting students into medical school. In fact, one of the years I attended, all who applied to medical school got in. Of my year, more than 75% of those who applied got in on their first try. The remaining students either got in on their second or third try (very common for most applicants), or ended up pursuing a PhD.\n\nPersonally, I majored in two fields: Biology and Economics. I performed research in both disciplines, and worked as a firefighter in Granville. Denison, being a small institution, allowed me to pursue these interests as well as several others. My research was grueling, but rewarding, and my science classes were incredibly rigorous. There are not only professor-offered research opportunities, but you have the option to design your own studies and pursue your own interests if you are a self-starter. The faculty are incredibly supportive, and care more about their students than their research. There are no graduate students at Denison either, so every single class you take will be taught by the professors themselves.  \n\nBut I also want to offer some advice for a pre-med journey: You do not need to graduate with a science major or minor to get into medical school. You only need to take a set of required courses known as \"pre-med\" courses (which Denison obviously offers). If you have an interest in one of the arts, go ahead and major in your passions! Being happy with your academics is important, and it will make you a more interesting applicant. During my application process for medical school, I never spoke about my biology degree, everyone wanted to know about my degrees in economics.  \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. I am happy to offer advice about Denison, the liberal arts, or medical school!  \n\nA few links you may want to look at: \nhttps://denison.edu/academics/history/feature/104208\n\nhttps://denison.edu/academics/biology/feature/136936\n\nhttps://denison.edu/liberal-arts",

Read your comment, loved how you explained everything in detail!\n\nI'm an international Denison admit (will attend!!!) and I plan to study Physics and Astronomy, while also exploring my other interests in Philosophy, International Relations, Archaeology, Data Analytics and Earth Sciences. \n\nThe fact that it's a Liberal Arts institution really appeals to me but I have so many interests, so is it possible to explore all of them at Denison?",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm here because I am thinking about applying to Denison for this upcoming admission cycle. I currently have 20 colleges on my list and am trying to narrow it down to around 10-12. I have limited knowledge of Denison and would like to hear from current students about their time there. If possible, could some people give me an honest pro and con list on the different aspects of the college? You can discuss anything \u2014 weather, academics, social life, athletics, or dining. I am planning on registering for information sessions but would like the information not given at info sessions. Thank you so much for your help!",

I\u2019ve gotten jobs, letters of rec, emotional support, grade bumps, etc. It\u2019s so worth it\nRelationships in General- Just hung out with President Weinberg 20 minutes ago, you meet awesome people, so many organizations\nStudy Abroad - Very available and encouraged\nFinancial Aid - Paying less than I would for my state school\nDecreasing acceptance rate - Acceptance rate is WAY lower this year than the past. My grade was the lowest in 2019 and it continues to lower each year. Currently ~18%. Really just prestige. \nAlumni Connections - I\u2019ve gotten internships, jobs, etc. They\u2019ve helped me with planning and have talked through careers with me. Just awesome people. \nAthletics - Many of the sports have D1 level athletes. Ex: One of the swimmers transferred from University of Iowa. Lax, field hockey, football, tennis, golf, and swimming have insanely talented people (other sports too)",

Denison, in my opinion, is a pretty good college the only downside I truly see is that it's in a secluded area so you will feel like you are confined on campus most of the time. The teachers are amazing though. The weather is pretty good, it's mainly hot but when it gets around December - April it starts to snow crazyyyyy. Social life is good, everybody is approachable. athletics is good the only downside is that the gym is at the bottom of the hill which is about a 10-20min walk if you are around East Quad. But yeah Denison is pretty good.",

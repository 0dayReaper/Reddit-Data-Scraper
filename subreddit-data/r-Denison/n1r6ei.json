It\u2019s fairly heterodox (If you know what MMT is it\u2019s fairly well regarded here), but isn\u2019t a well known heterodox program (like Umass Amherst). \n\nIts phd placement seems to be pretty poor, though it has produced at least one economist of note, Claudia Sahm. If you are interested in a PhD you\u2019d be better off majoring in math and minoring in Econ anyway, so this point may be somewhat moot.\n\nAs far as the students go, there are lots of folks who major in Econ because they want to go to B school but don\u2019t attend a school with a business degree. Global commerce has sucked up some of these people, but they exist.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether they did this to cater to the above \u201cI want a business degree but go to a SLAC\u201d demographic, but Denison\u2019s Econ degree also requires distressingly little math. \n\nYou can graduate with an Econ degree *without having taken single variable calculus*, meaning that upper level Econ courses can\u2019t assume a decent math (calc, linear algebra, proofs) background. This means that certain fundamental proofs that are taught in most undergrad Econ programs (like the fundamental welfare theorems) are basically ignored from what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like an ass, if you do come to Denison I would minor in Econ and major in math.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI was planning on applying to Denison University and on their website they indicate that the school is score optional and they pride themselves on this fact I think. I would like to send my scores but couldn't find anything about self-reporting my scores. Do any of  you know if they allow this or if I will have to send my scores the official way. (Also my best score is 1400. Do you think I should send this score?) I'm an international so if any of these questions or statements upset you I really didn't have any intention to do so. Thank you very much in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

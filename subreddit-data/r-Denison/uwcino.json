            "comment": "There are a couple of jobs on Campus like the mailroom, lifeguard, tutoring, gift shop, and many others. The pay rate is around 10.50/hr so don't expect anything crazy. You can work at whit's ice cream if you want but my recommendation of advice. If you don't have a car DONT WORK AT EASTON or any place near Columbus City.\n\nI made the mistake of working at Easton without having a car so I had to pay Ubers don't make the mistake I made. Uber's to Easton and to Columbus City cost around 40-50 USD.\n\nYou can also look for internships and summer research with professors which can pay up to around 4k depending on the task. For instance, my roommate is doing summer research with a professor and is being paid around 4k just for 2 months of research for the chem department.  Summer research is good but its **HIGHLY SELECTIVE** you either have to know your professor really well or being really freaking smart.\n\nYou can also get internships. Good thing about Denison is that they personally help you get internships to your field of study. And lets say you get an internship but they don't pay you anything, than Denison will **PAY YOU**. Which is really good in my opinion.\n\nAlso lets just say you have a business idea and you want to take it to the next level, well Denison also offers the Red Frame Lab where you can talk to experts that will help you to get your business on the road which will hopefully make you a lot of income.\n\nHowever in my opinion, if you want the most amount of income then Focus on your study, then get an internship, and hopefully, that internship can skyrocket you to a good job!",

A question was brought up regarding your reply, and I wanted to clarify that the summer research with professors pay is not 10-40k. I'm not sure if it was a typo or not, but on campus summer research pays 4k over 10 weeks of research. In freshman year you may opt to do 5 week of research for 2k as well as a \"early experience\" option.",

What's the job placement like? Do a lot of students go to google/facebook/microsoft/etc...? \n3. What's the culture in the CS department like? Are people competitive, nice, are people friends with each other, etc...?\n4. Are the professors good? Can you get enough attention from them?\n5.

            "comment": "I just graduated from Denison with a CS degree (definitely semi-doxxing myself but w/e, who cares, nothing on this account is that interesting). Answering your questions in order:\n\n&gt; How is the CS department teaching wise?\n\nIt\u2019s good! I wouldn\u2019t describe any of the professors as bad, or even mediocre - most of them fall somewhere between \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d. The classes are small, the professors are attentive and accessible, and the course content is top notch. The curriculum is *very* theory heavy relative to other programs, which imo is good, but if you\u2019re looking for a class like \u201chow to make a mobile app\u201d, Denison doesn\u2019t have that kind of stuff (for good reason)\n\n&gt; What's the job placement like? Do a lot of students go to google/facebook/microsoft/etc...? \n\nNot gonna sugar coat this one, it\u2019s not great.\n\nHere are two posts I made ([post 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fd9bt2/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_new_grads/fjgrvle/?context=3), [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fd9bt2/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_new_grads/fjgscls/?context=3)) detailing my job search results if you\u2019re curious what a Denison degree and a little elbow grease (plus being a white, male, native English speaker) might get you\n\nUnfortunately, I think my relative success in the job market is anomalous - most Denison CS students don\u2019t end up in Silicon Valley, and I can only think of one recent alum who works at a FAANG (common abbreviation for facebook, amazon, apple, netflix, google). The good news is that, from what I\u2019ve seen, this is the fault of individual students rather than the school writ large. Denison does a great job of preparing you for technical interviews, but you\u2019ll have to put in some extra work on your own. \n\nAs mentioned above, Denison\u2019s curriculum is very theory heavy. This will help you prep for job interviews at pretigious tech companies, since none of them give a shit about practical skills and mostly ask theory-centric questions in interviews, but you'll have to put in some extra work and practice to get all the way there. Unfortunately, a lot of Denison students don't seem aware of this, or simply don't care. \n\nOther schools have older students/alums who have gotten internships/jobs at FAANG and can tell younger students how to prep for interviews, how to apply, when to apply, etc\u2026 Denison doesn\u2019t have that kind of alumni network, so you have to seek that kind of information out on your own. At another college the career center would help make up for that knowledge gap - unfortunately, when it comes to software jobs Denison's career center is worse than useless, don\u2019t even bother talking to them. I did a lot of interview prep on my own, and while I didn\u2019t get a FAANG job offer (I did make it past Google\u2019s interview process, but didn\u2019t end up matching with a team), I did pretty okay. I got a couple 6-figure-Silicon-Valley-offers, which is probably all you want anyway. \n\ntl;dr, if you put in the work you\u2019ll be fine, but there\u2019s no institutional culture of reaching for FAANG jobs, so you\u2019re kinda on your own. \n\nAs an aside, don\u2019t chase the tech-job prestige dragon. If you score that Microsoft job, the prestige-chasing mindset won\u2019t go away and you\u2019ll just set your sights on google. And after you get to google, you\u2019ll set your sights on an even more selective firm like Jane Street or Akuna Capital. The sooner you get over the whole \u201cI want to work at a prestigious company\u201d thing, the better. There are more important things in life than making some tech CEO even richer. \n\nIf you're looking for self-teaching and learning resources, the /r/cscareerquestions subreddit is good, order a copy of **Cracking the Coding Interview**, and make sure to bookmark [leetcode](https://leetcode.com)\n\n&gt; What's the culture in the CS department like? Are people competitive, nice, are people friends with each other, etc...?\n\nThe CS department\u2019s culture is\u2026 fine. I made some friends in the department, but I wasn\u2019t friends with them *because* we were both CS students, I made friends with them in contexts outside the department (like sports or clubs or w/e) and they just so happened to be CS majors. I double majored in another subject (there\u2019s the doxxing info!) and my other major's cohort had a much stronger social group despite being far smaller. \n\n&gt; Are the professors good? Can you get enough attention from them?\n\nAs I said above, the professors are great. They\u2019re accessible, and if you go out of your way to ask them questions they\u2019ll be more than happy to chat about CS and non-CS stuff. \n\n&gt; For CS majors, what made you decide to major in CS at Denison? \n\nI like discrete math, computer systems, making lots of money, brain teasers, and algorithms. Unfortunately there are no non-CS degrees that check all those boxes, so I had to settle for CS.",

Looks like you're getting lots of good info in the rest of the thread.\n\nI don't work at Palantir - while the money was tempting, going with that offer would have required some personal sacrifices that I wasn't willing to make (my job search\u2019s primary goal was ending up in the same place as my partner, not maximizing total compensation). I don't feel particularly comfortable saying *exactly* where I work, but it's a tech company you've heard of that\u2019s paying me more than enough - again, like I said above, don't focus too much on the money/prestige thing. If you work in software, you will make enough money to have a happy, fulfilling life. It seems, from the other comments in this thread, that you're anxious about that - don't be. \n\nMy second major (as you can probably surmise from my comment history) was philosophy. I would absolutely recommend double majoring, especially in something completely (or seemingly) unrelated to computer science. Being able to write clearly and cogently is, in my opinion, a super power in the world of CS - doing a second major in philosophy, english, history, classics, etc... is (imo) a great choice. Another popular double major combo is CS/Math - my CS advisor told me to take as much math as I could get away with, and he was right. I constantly feel my lack of math expertise biting me in the ass, and if I ever do a MS in CS or something I'll probably have to do some \"catch up\" linear algebra, combinatorics, etc... work. One specific recommendation: no matter where you go, there will probably be a math class called \"intro to proofs\" or \"proofs\" or something like that. Take it, even if you decide not to major in CS. I don't care what your major is, a proofs class is one of the best uses of your time out there. \n\nAs for the workload, if you love both your majors it's not that big a deal. I would, oftentimes, take a \"break\" from CS work by reading a philosophy paper (or vice versa). If you're just slogging through to get the \"double major\" check mark on your resume I can see how it might feel like a lot of work, but if you genuinely love both majors it shouldn't be too overwhelming. You should, as a word of caution, try to stagger your courses such that you're not taking difficult classes in both your majors at the same time. I took two upper level CS classes at the same time as a (quite difficult) philosophy of law class. I wouldn't recommend doing something like that, it was not a fun semester.",

            "comment": "I just graduated from Denison this spring with a double major in math and CS! Math and CS are the same department (even though they're separate majors), so all of my answers are pretty much reflective of both sides, if you're potentially interested in math as well. I see myself more as a CS person though :) \n\n1. For the most part, I think Denison's CS professors are very good, teaching-wise. Some will always be better than others, but all of the professors there chose to work at Denison because they genuinely enjoy teaching. As a result, they put WAY more effort into teaching and interacting with students than professors at larger universities would.  The classes are small (my largest one was probably 30 people in intro to CS; my smallest was 6 in an upper-level elective) and the professors really pay attention to the students and what they need help with. \n2. I'm starting a PhD program this fall, so I can't speak too much to job placement. If you're potentially interested in grad school, our CS department has a relatively good placement rate there, although I think most Denison CS students go into industry after graduating. I know of Denison students going on to work on PhDs at highly-ranked universities (for CS) like University of Michigan, UT Austin, and Duke. My own offers to PhD programs were really good and my professors in the CS department were SUPER helpful with my applications. If you ARE interested in grad school, Denison as whole has some good resources and programs to help you prepare for it. \n3. I would say that the culture is not super competitive, which I really liked. I can only think of one or two people I had classes with while I was there who fit the stereotype of like, techie guy who has been coding since he was six and wants everyone to know how smart he is. The department isn't too big, so you'll know everyone else in your class year after a while. I made the majority of my friends in my dorm and through clubs, but that was mostly because I chose to not spend a ton of time working in the computer lab. As a whole, I think the culture of the department is really positive and friendly. \n4. I think Denison's CS professors are FANTASTIC. You've probably already heard the marketing talk about how Denison has great student-faculty relationships (and if you haven't, you definitely will) but I honestly think it's only slightly exaggerated. The CS professors are really, really great. Most of them hold a lot of office hours (like at least 6-8 hours a week) and are really accessible outside of those hours too. I've house-sat and pet-sat for multiple professors and one professor took all of the students who took some particularly difficult upper-level electives out for drinks in Granville at the end of the year. There are also a fair number of social events run by the professors that are actually a lot of fun; discussion forums about issues in CS, puzzle days with one of the math professors, an end-of-year picnic that all the students and professors attend.\n5. I knew I wanted to major in CS before I started college after taking some classes in high school, and I knew I wanted to go to a liberal arts school for the smaller size and ability to study things besides CS. I decided on Denison specifically because 1) I noticed that their CS department seemed much bigger than other liberal arts colleges' did and 2) when I visited campus, I ended up sitting down and talking with two professors for about an hour after one of them forgot to list one of their classes as cancelled and I tried to sit in on it. It was totally unplanned but they just gave me their time to talk about Denison, grad school, etc. and it gave me a really positive impression of the school. I didn't get that at any of the other schools I visited.\n\nFeel free to ask any other questions you might have. I'm guessing it's pretty difficult to be a rising senior right now so I'm happy to help if I can :)",

                            "comment": "I think a fair number of people go to graduate/medical/law overall at Denison across all majors, although I don\u2019t know the exact stats. I think it\u2019s much more common for CS majors to go into industry, but that\u2019s going to be true for any university just because you take a serious pay cut to go to graduate school in CS. You get paid to get PhD (if you apply to a PhD and they tell you you\u2019ll have to pay tuition, they\u2019re basically rejecting you) but you still make about 1/4 of what your peers going into industry make in entry level positions. \n\nI think that Denison probably has better resources in place for preparing students for grad school in CS than job placement in CS, partially because the folks in the career center don\u2019t know much about how to get CS jobs (it\u2019s pretty different from other industries, I believe). Denison has a very good program that pays students to do research over the summer with professors and has a whole office that helps students apply for national awards and postgraduate fellowships like Fullbrights, Goldwater Scholarship, NSF fellowships, etc. They helped me out a lot while I was at Denison and definitely made me a more competitive grad school applicant. Since all of the CS professors went to grad school at some point, they were somewhat more helpful to me with my applications than they were to my friends applying for industry jobs. For example, one new professor connected me with a friend of his who was still in his PhD program in the same subfield I\u2019ll be going into, which ended up being really really helpful. \n\nBasically, Denison has very good programs and resources for students interested in research and grad school across all disciplines, but their resources for job placement in CS specifically are not as good. I think they are working to change that though. Honestly though, I think Denison has equivalent or better resources than most small liberal arts schools when it comes to CS and either way, if you really want to make the most of them you need to seek them out and put in the work yourself. I agree with some of the issues raised by other comments about issues with job placement but I think that those aren\u2019t issues that are just limited to Denison; big companies aren\u2019t going to recruit heavily at small schools or have large cohorts from them to help new students out. I think that there are a lot of other benefits you get at a school like Denison like small class sizes, better relationships with professors, etc. that, for me, outweigh those downsides. \n\nSorry for such a long response! If you\u2019re willing to share, I\u2019d be interested in hearing what other schools you\u2019re considering at the moment.",

I personally think Denison is a hidden gem in terms of CS and Data Analytics where there is a really good mix of theory and practical skills. I can\u2019t speak on career placement as a sophomore but I have found the professors to be really incredible and the culture to be very friendly. I have found the content in my CS classes so far to be pretty quick paced but the profs are more than willing to adjust the pace and accommodate students. My experience has been that to professors have a very good grip on their courses (with 2 of my textbooks being written by Denison faculty) which allows for a very efficient experience. I haven\u2019t declared a major yet but if I were to choose CS or DA it would be because I have genuinely enjoyed the classes and what we learn is incredibly interesting. I wouldn\u2019t say that the CS department itself has a \u201cculture\u201d just because at Denison you make friends with people of every interest and the whole campus is very connected. Then again, I am only a rising sophomore so I may not have been introduced to the upper level class culture yet.",

It varies based on the professor, but the rate my professor website will help you out here.\n\n2. I don't hear a lot about my classmates getting jobs at big tech companies, but there are definitely a few of them. We occasionally have alumni come back to talk to the department. Several of which I can remember have worked at Garmin, 3M, and Lucasarts.\n\n3. The department culture is nice, but most people have their nose to the grindstone and won't go out of their way to socialize while working in the department building. You'll make friends over time, but it's not like it's a big party. People aren't too competitive, but you'll meet at least one strange person you'll tell stories about, as it's a science major at a liberal arts schools XD\n\n4. Profs are great. Sometimes their office hours may not line up with your schedule, but they do try to make themselves available.\n\n5. I was between classics and computer science ( yeah u know who it is :) ) and I ended up picking computer science because it was so much more stimulating. A lot of paper writing majors like ANSO, History, and Classics have their merits, and it's great that the GEs at Denison make you try them out, but I felt like I was making a creative impact on the world when I made a CS project, something that I could see a future in. When I wrote my paper about Alexander the Great, I learned quite a bit and had an artifact I could show my experience with, but I didn't see a future in it.",

The CS department offers courses that apply directly to the industry like Software Engineering, Networking, and AI. There are gatherings every now and then where students can practice interview questions together and share some pizza, but we don't get big tech companies regularly walking through our hallways asking to hire us. When we have guests, they're usually speakers from higher education speaking about their own research in math and CS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't feel unprepared to go work in app/software development, though. The advice I got from the career center was from another student who was trained to improve resumes, which was a bit helpful. The career center also offers mock interviews and career development talks, but I haven't had the time to make much use of them. However, I did recently do an internship through Denison's RedFrame lab for entrepreneurship which had me doing consulting for several clients. Denison's got a lot of people and places that can help you out, but searching them out is a bit of the work. As I have understood it, Denison won't have famous tech companies bidding for their CS grads right out of graduation, but a Denison education will give you what you need to get started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe theoretical, higher education side of Denison is much more present. You'll get emails on the regular from the office that gives you information about scholarships and opportunities for cool academic things to put on your resume. While that's very helpful, I really don't make use of it too often.",

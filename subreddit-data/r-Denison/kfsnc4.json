    "postText": "Hi dear Denisonians!\n\nI'm an applicant to Denison's class of 2025 who is looking for an opinion of Denison students and alumni of my chances on getting in. Besides that, if you could provide your opinion on whether I would be a good fit for Denison based on my application components, it would be awesome!\n\n**Intended Major:** Financial Economics\n\n**Demographics**: Male. 17 Years Old. International student from Medell\u00edn, Colombia. Middle class. Applying for full aid (Although I'm middle class here in Colombia, my family income bracket is way below 65.000 USD a year) Attended a Private-Religious school that is nation-wide recognized (My counselor put into context with the AO everything important about my school)\n\n**Stats**: 4.42 UW GPA on the 5-scale. Ranked 6/136 in my class. 1340 SAT (700 Math, 640 Reading). The curriculum at my school is the same for everyone, so no AP's.\n\n**Extracurriculars** (I summarized some of them)\n\n\\- Mentored over 70 middle and high school students for the last 4 years. Taught them STEM and Humanities subjects. 25 hours per week, 50 weeks per year.\n\n\\- Represented students at my school as the Student Government President. Created distance learning strategies, helped to raise over $26K for paying student's tuition during the quarantine.\n\n\\- Developed the 8th version of the school model UN which had over 180 particpants. Led a team of 20 presidents, arranged academic affairs of 10 committees, mentored over 60 delegates.\n\n\\- Created a fitness business during quarantine. Delivered fitness equipment to over 300 customers all over the nation.\n\n\\- Created a charity event that delivered 100 Christmas gifts to low-income children at a local hospital. Recruited and led a group of 50 teenagers. Also collaborated in several other charity initiatives throughout my entire city.\n\n\\- Competed in over 12 races including a half marathon and the Youth Departamental Games\n\n\\- Researched how to build a Machine Learning model to predict crop yield. Self-taught machine learning, developed a predictive model for housing prices, attended an AI and Financial Technology fair.\n\n**Awards:**\n\n\\- Finalist of a National Economics Essay Contest. Chosen over 900 contestants.\n\n\\- Outstanding delegate, best speaker and best delegate awards in 7 different Models UN nation-wide\n\n\\- 1st Place in School's Intercollegiate oratorical contest.\n\n\\- School's honor mention for solidarity, entrepreneurship and communication skills\n\n\\- Ranked in the 75th percentile of an international Machine Learning competition\n\n**Essay:** Talked about what means to be Paisa (a Medell\u00edn citizen). It explains some very unique circumstances I've faced by living in my city and how they have shaped me as a person. In the additional information of Common App, I explained more deeply my mentoring extracurricular and wrote about how I've been able to provide to my family by being a mentor.\n\n**LoRs:** I would say they are pretty good overall. One is from my Calculus teacher who has been at my school for the last 29 years and considered me as one of the best students he has ever taught. The other is from an humanities teacher who knows me very well and encouraged me to study abroad.\n\nI also had an alumni interview in July. I feel I gave a good impression. She told me I would be a good fit at Denison, but having your perspective would be great!",

            "comment": "Sounds like you'd be a good fit! You've got a very solid chance at acceptance based on what you wrote. Denison admissions looks for well rounded kids and gives a lot of attention to the applicant outside of their GPA and test scores. There are lots of opportunities for students in terms of extracurriculars and academics despite being a smaller school, which really gives you an opportunity to participate and stand out, which is one thing I always enjoyed. I went into Denison an Econ major too, then switched to English, then graduated with a Global Commerce degree, so I definitely appreciated all the chances I had to explore my interests. Good luck!",

I\u2019ve met some great people and I\u2019ve met some terrible people. The administration is so so. I\u2019ve met very nice administration but I\u2019ve also met and heard about racism within administration. Professor are great in comparison to other schools. Location is subpar in my opinion but that\u2019s also a matter of what kind of surroundings you like. However, like I said earlier, you can do better than Denison. I think you have a good chance of getting into some ivy leagues with everything on your resume.",

I would be very thankful if you could elaborate more on that (maybe through PM?)\n\nBesides that, surely I applied to the prestigious and fancy colleges too. However, after attending Denison's webinars, I realized that it would definitely be a place I would want to be if they give me the opportunity. \n\nDespite that, thank you very much for your insight and advice!",

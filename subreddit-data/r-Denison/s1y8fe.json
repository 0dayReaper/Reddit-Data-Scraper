Is there anything to look out for? I want to tell them not to worry but I also don\u2019t want them to completely let down their guard.",

            "comment": "Denison is in the middle of rural Ohio and in a village that is largly upper-middle-class white people. In terms of being safe at night, there are not many safer areas. There's also campus safety that does multiple regular patrols with at least one that goes the entire night (most stops at \\~2:30 am) and cameras too at the entrances of dorms. I believe there is still a safe-walk program where you call and a campus safety staffer will walk or drive you where you need to on campus.  \n\nThat said, violent personal crimes do happen. Rape and sexual assault are an issue and are undercounted/unreported but Denison is no different than other colleges. Most of them happen in the dorms, with alcohol, and between people that know each other in some way. I'm not saying that to shift blame (it is always on the rapist) but to say that if you are walking to and from the library or from wherever the hell they are throwing parties now back to your dorm you'll most likely be safe. You'll more likely encounter a deer than another person.",

Some areas outside of the schools campus might be a little dangerous to be in but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been to Easton Town Center since 3am and no one did anything dangerous to me. And the campus safety is EVERYWHERE at night time. They\u2019ve questioned my uber driver several times lol. But yeah Denison campus is very safe in my opinion!",

I do take precautions though and always have pepper spray with me, but I never felt the need to hold it or something. I work until 3:30 am sometimes and walking alone was never an issue. I\u2019ve also walked back to my dorm from parties alone and also felt safe. And if you ever feel unsafe you can call campus security to give you a ride.",

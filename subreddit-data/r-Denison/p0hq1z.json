            "comment": "I think it can be broken down into three categories: \n\nMajor expenses that loans will cover, IE tuition, meal plans, room: generally you should spend nothing a month because you already paid at the beginning of each semester/took on loans to pay. \n\nMinor expenses, such as eating out, School supplies, dorm supplies, traveling: could be anywhere from $0 to hundreds but that\u2019s special. Sometimes I go spending $0 a month but I know people who come from stupidly wealthy families and spend hundreds a month, If not in a weekend sometimes. \n\nFinally, Natty Lite budget: $100 a month should work.",

If you want to go to the mall you have to call an Uber which will average around 40-50 dollars USD. However of you know a couple guys they can hook you up with this guy known as \"Ubercaller\" he gets you ubers 60% off so a 40 dollar ride goes down to 18 dollars. I use him every time I go to the mall. But yeah if you come to Denison you might feel like your trapped on campus. They don't even offer rental cars anymore cus of \"covid\" yet no one wears their masks",

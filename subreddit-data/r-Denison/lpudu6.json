There\u2019s a social circle for literally everybody and it\u2019s not hard to find like-minded people at all. You might have to put yourself out of your comfort zone a little bit at first, but it totally pays off. You\u2019re gonna have sooooo much fun, dude.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m too lazy to type a lengthy answer out again, but I\u2019m a recent Denison CS grad. Someone asked this question about 6 months ago, here\u2019s what I said: \n\nI just graduated from Denison with a CS degree (definitely semi-doxxing myself but w/e, who cares, nothing on this account is that interesting). Answering your questions in order:\n\n&gt; How is the CS department teaching wise?\n\nIt\u2019s good! I wouldn\u2019t describe any of the professors as bad, or even mediocre - most of them fall somewhere between \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d. The classes are small, the professors are attentive and accessible, and the course content is top notch. The curriculum is very theory heavy relative to other programs, which imo is good, but if you\u2019re looking for a class like \u201chow to make a mobile app\u201d, Denison doesn\u2019t have that kind of stuff (for good reason)\n\n&gt; What's the job placement like? Do a lot of students go to google/facebook/microsoft/etc...?\n\nNot gonna sugar coat this one, it\u2019s not great.\n\nHere are two posts I made ([post 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fd9bt2/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_new_grads/fjgrvle/?context=3), [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fd9bt2/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_new_grads/fjgscls/?context=3)) detailing my job search results if you\u2019re curious what a Denison degree and a little elbow grease (plus being a white, male, native English speaker) might get you\n\nUnfortunately, I think my relative success in the job market is anomalous - most Denison CS students don\u2019t end up in Silicon Valley, and I can only think of one recent alum who works at a FAANG (common abbreviation for facebook, amazon, apple, netflix, google). The good news is that, from what I\u2019ve seen, this is the fault of individual students rather than the school writ large. Denison does a great job of preparing you for technical interviews, but you\u2019ll have to put in some extra work on your own.\n\nAs mentioned above, Denison\u2019s curriculum is very theory heavy. This will help you prep for job interviews at pretigious tech companies, since none of them give a shit about practical skills and mostly ask theory-centric questions in interviews, but you'll have to put in some extra work and practice to get all the way there. Unfortunately, a lot of Denison students don't seem aware of this, or simply don't care.\n\nOther schools have older students/alums who have gotten internships/jobs at FAANG and can tell younger students how to prep for interviews, how to apply, when to apply, etc\u2026 Denison doesn\u2019t have that kind of alumni network, so you have to seek that kind of information out on your own. At another college the career center would help make up for that knowledge gap - unfortunately, when it comes to software jobs Denison's career center is worse than useless, don\u2019t even bother talking to them. I did a lot of interview prep on my own, and while I didn\u2019t get a FAANG job offer (I did make it past Google\u2019s interview process, but didn\u2019t end up matching with a team), I did pretty okay. I got a couple 6-figure-Silicon-Valley-offers, which is probably all you want anyway.\n\ntl;dr, if you put in the work you\u2019ll be fine, but there\u2019s no institutional culture of reaching for FAANG jobs, so you\u2019re kinda on your own.\n\nAs an aside, don\u2019t chase the tech-job prestige dragon. If you score that Microsoft job, the prestige-chasing mindset won\u2019t go away and you\u2019ll just set your sights on google. And after you get to google, you\u2019ll set your sights on an even more selective firm like Jane Street or Akuna Capital. The sooner you get over the whole \u201cI want to work at a prestigious company\u201d thing, the better. There are more important things in life than making some tech CEO even richer.\n\nIf you're looking for self-teaching and learning resources, the r/cscareerquestions subreddit is good, order a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview, and make sure to bookmark leetcode\n\n&gt; What's the culture in the CS department like? Are people competitive, nice, are people friends with each other, etc...?\n\nThe CS department\u2019s culture is\u2026 fine. I made some friends in the department, but I wasn\u2019t friends with them because we were both CS students, I made friends with them in contexts outside the department (like sports or clubs or w/e) and they just so happened to be CS majors. I double majored in another subject (there\u2019s the doxxing info!) and my other major's cohort had a much stronger social group despite being far smaller.\n\n&gt; Are the professors good? Can you get enough attention from them?\n\nAs I said above, the professors are great. They\u2019re accessible, and if you go out of your way to ask them questions they\u2019ll be more than happy to chat about CS and non-CS stuff.\n\n&gt; For CS majors, what made you decide to major in CS at Denison?\n\nI like discrete math, computer systems, making lots of money, brain teasers, and algorithms. Unfortunately there are no non-CS degrees that check all those boxes, so I had to settle for CS.",

The school has many attractive features, but number one is its attractive people. The kids who go to Denison are just generally hot. You are thinking about cs so this may not apply to anyone involved in cs. Second is the drug scene. Impeccable. You honestly have to be careful drinking from water bottles at this school, I swear to you half of them are filled with molly water. Fraternity and sorority life are huge too. But again with you being cs not sure how much of this applies to you. Faculty is chill af, sometimes you\u2019ll even see professors sparking blunts in their cars in the garage under slayter. Come to Denison if you want a taste of success along with bumps of coke and k",

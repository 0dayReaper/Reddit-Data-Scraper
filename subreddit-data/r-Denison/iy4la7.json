    "postText": "Hey r/Denison! Your moderators have granted me permission to post about the organization that I intern for\u2013so if you\u2019re at all interested in helping out prospective college applicants by making posts about Dension\u2019s campus then please stick around!\r\n\r\nWhat is this organization? A site called CollegeVizzy; a platform that aims to improve the college application process for students who lack the ability to visit college campuses in person.  \r\n\r\nHow does the site achieve this goal?  Effectively, CV aggregates thoughts, opinions, ideas, and comments about different university campuses in a format that is readily accessible to prospective students.  Instead of relying solely on clicking through a school\u2019s virtual tour, or their social media pages, applicants are offered firsthand accounts of what campus life is like. \r\n\r\nWhy?  The idea for this site was spawned on a different subreddit \u2014 r/ApplyingtoCollege \u2014 by a moderator who was dismayed by the lack of options for first generation and low income students who wanted to learn as much as possible about the schools they were applying to.  Of course in the time of COVID, the usefulness of this site has taken on a new dimension.  Right now, more than probably ever until this point, high school students could use as much information as possible to learn about the schools they hope to attend.  \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in making an account, the link to the site is below.  Everything is free to use, there are no ads, we sell no user data, and making a post will enter you into a giveaway that we\u2019re running for a $150 Uber Eats gift card.  If you have any questions about the site or about posting, or any feedback, leave it down below.  I didn\u2019t want to make this post unbearably long, so if there\u2019s anything that doesn\u2019t make sense or isn\u2019t clear I would be more than happy to follow up in the comments.  \r\n\r\nThanks a bunch, and good luck with this semester.\r\n\r\n(For those of you who are concerned about spam, this will be our one and only post per the wishes of your moderator team).\n\nLink! https://collegevizzy.com",

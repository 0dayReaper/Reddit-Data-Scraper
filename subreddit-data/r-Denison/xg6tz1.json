            "comment": "Hey,   \nI think I replied to one of your posts in another subreddit.  \nI applied last year RD with thrice IAAC medalist and interests in physics and astronomy.  \nI got in with $55k per year (full need met) which is nearly full tuition at 60k.  \nAs I have seen after contacting several people to help my juniors at school that Denison prefers partial pay or at least people who need full tuition over full ride.  \nI have seen not more than 4-5 full rides given to internationals so I believe that you would be wasting precious ED if you end up not getting in.  \nI think you can use your ED to trinity, brandeis, lafayette where other people do not apply ED and offer full rides more than Denison in particular.  \nThis is my advice in regards to admissions.  \nBut you have great ECs and honors to back up so you would be an excellent fit to Denison.   \nYou can see by applying so plan accordingly.  \nMaybe RD would help you better at Denison but take this with a grain of salt.  \nBest of Luck.   \n:)",

I hadn't found any information about the financial aid. and brandis prefers first generations and is above my act score so it might be difficult.  lafayette might actually be a good chance.  \nI will take your advice and maybe make Denison as ed2 in case things didn't work in ed1. Thank you so much for answering me.",

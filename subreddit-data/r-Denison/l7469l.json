My family is not in any kind of a position to pay an amount this high without assuming serious financial vulnerability. I have explored the work-study opportunities offered by the school and noticed that they are competitive. I would like to ask any current or former Denison student if:\n\n1) the work study program can significantly reduce tuition without jeopardizing campus life\n\n2) If the program is as competitive as it is represented\n\n3) If students with low family income are prioritized over ones with higher income \n\nDenison is my dream school and I really, really want to make this work.\n\nThank you",

Everything from sitting a desk doing homework while people worked out, to working for IT (what I did).\n\nThere are also jobs in Granville and Newark that people will get if they want higher wages or other types of work.",

Recognize that as students turn down their packages they may be able to offer more toward the end of the spring. you certainly can make a case that your financial situation was not reflected in your FAFSA and bring documentation to support that. I was eligible for work-study but I don't think that it significantly impacted my financial aid situation but it did allow me to have money in my pocket. good luck and I hope you end up at dennison, it was a fantastic school and it did offer me a lot of support as a low-income first-generation college student. And they've only gotten better about it since I've left.",

Did you do it through email or phone, what circumstances were you in etc.\n\nI'm taking a deferral year, so I probably won't appeal this year considering that financial aid is awarded based on my FAFSA. However, I do intend on appealing as the worst they can say is no. My mother is in danger of being laid off, but I'm not sure if that'll be relevant if it hasn't happened yet.\n\nAny reply would be greatly appreciated!",

But from what I recall I contacted financial aid office and asked about an appeal based on a change of financial circumstances since my family's taxes and FAFSA had been filed. You will need to be able to show proof that things actually have changed, not just that they might change. Such as being laid off. \n\nI would recommend googling how to appeal your financial aid decision and see what other people say. You might also check out r/studentloans and some other similar subs about financial and financial aid advice for students.",

            "comment": "&gt;I would like to ask any current or former Denison student if: 1. the work study program can significantly reduce tuition\n\nIt really depends on how much of a difference you need, but becoming an RA (Resident Assistant) (now formally called CA \u2014 Community Advisor \u2014 by Denison) gets you a free room on-top of being paid 7hrs/week at around $9/hr. If you're a US citizen you can only work 10hrs/week under the work-study opportunity (international students can work 20hrs/week.)\n\nHowever, you can't become a CA until sophomore year, and there's no guarantee you get the position. So assuming the best case scenario for a US citizen would be...\n\n10hrs \\* $9 \\* 35 weeks = $3,150/year from on-campus job pay. I mean, it helps, I worked on campus all four years, but realistically you're probably not concerned about $12,600 of debt, as that's definitely a manageable amount of debt to take on.\n\nSo assuming you get a CA job sophomore year, and you keep it throughout the rest of college, that's $7,600 (cost of a double room) saved each year for three years, or $22,800 in total over your time at Denison.\n\nSo best case you can save $35,400 over four years through work study if you get a student job freshmen year, work 10hrs/week, and then get a CA job sophomore year and work another on-campus job for 3hrs/week for the next 3 years: that's a lot of money and that's roughly what I did (though I studied abroad a semester, so I didn't have a job that semester due to the country requiring a worker's visa (student visa not good enough), but I got a scholarship to go abroad, so didn't have a huge impact on my overall finances.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;without jeopardizing campus life\n\nI was a STEM major with a 3.5 GPA (didn't plan on going to grad school, so that was good enough GPA for me), so I'd definitely say it's doable, but certainly difficult at times. Suffered sleep deprivation at times and definitely struggled mentally during certain semesters, though not always due to class or work. Still, made some great friends and had some really fun times (and learned a ton!) I'm glad I went to Denison, took the classes that I took, and worked the jobs that I worked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;2. If the program is as competitive as it is represented\n\nIt was super easy to get an on-campus job when I went to Denison. Not sure how it is now with COVID, as that could very well change how many jobs on campus there are. However, becoming an RA was fairly competitive. They actually turned me down at first (putting me as a backup), but someone ended up quitting or getting fired and I got the job. They fired a lot of RAs over the years for some BS reasons, though fortunately that never happened to me. Most other campus jobs pretty much never fire someone unless they do a really bad job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;3. If students with low family income are prioritized over ones with higher income\n\nNo clue, but I very much doubt it has any impact. From [Denison's website](https://denison.edu/campus/finances/student-employment): \"If you have a Federal Work Study award in your financial aid package, your earnings will be paid out of federal funds. If you do not have a financial aid award or Federal Work-Study awarded in your financial aid package, your student employment earnings will be paid from university funds.  Regardless, it is the student\u2019s responsibility to seek out employment on campus.\"\n\nI imagine the departments hiring do not check what a student's financial needs are (e.g. ITS isn't going to pull up your financial information when making a decision, they're just going to hire you based off whether they think you can perform the job well.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, it just depends on how much financial aid you're currently being offered, how much you're able to currently pay, and how much you expect to earn after college. $25,000 in student loans is totally manageable as long as you're making at least $30k/year and living in an affordable location (parts of Columbus, OH would be fine with that paycheck.) $50,000 in student loans is going to be tough, but possibly survivable if making enough and living very frugally. $75,000 and you're almost certainly going to have to live with your parents and be getting a pretty good salary. $100,000 and you better be dead set on becoming a doctor, because otherwise you're never paying that off. $150k or more and you better be making some incredible 6 figure salary or you're screwed. [Source.](https://loans.usnews.com/articles/how-much-student-loan-debt-is-too-much)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf an on campus job can bring you to $50k of student debt or under, then great. Otherwise, as u/mldkfa said, you need to negotiate with them and see how you can get it to that level.\n\nPS: If you're extremely set on Denison and negotiation fails, and you can keep up with your classes and jobs, you can get a job at the dining hall and they pay more (IIRC somewhere around $12/hr) and don't count towards your hours limit for the work-study program. But realistically few people can be a full-time student, be an RA, have another on-campus job, and work in the dining hall and not fail a class, get fired for missing work, or be painfully miserable. 3 jobs and 4 to 5 classes is a bit much. But I did meet someone who did it! If I were that desperate I probably just wouldn't have gone to Denison though honestly. I'm glad I was able to go, but 2 jobs and a full schedule was exhausting enough. A third job would've been horrible.\n\nAnyway, I wish you the best of luck! I hope you can figure this out! I'm really thankful I was able to go to Denison, and I hope you are able to as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: default best case work-study can save $12,600 over four years (easy pre-COVID), and $35,400 total if you become a CA sophomore year (fairly competitive). If that doesn't bring you to a total of $50k of student debt or less, negotiate with admissions about financial need.",

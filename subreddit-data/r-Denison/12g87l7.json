    "postText": "Hey everyone, this post is mostly for people considering Denison. If any of you have any actual questions about Denison I\u2019m here and willing to answer 100 percent honestly. I\u2019m a Computer Science Major with a math minor, but I\u2019ve taken a ton of courses at Denison and I\u2019m willing to give you the perspective of an actual student at Denison right now instead of the watered down versions of answers you\u2019ll get from anyone else. I can answer responses from pretty much any department because I have lots for friends and I believe at least a little insight into any department, therefore I am able to give you a fair answer for anything you might ask. Feel free to dm me any questions you may have or comment on this post and I\u2019ll respond as quick as I can with an actual legitimate answer you probably won\u2019t get from a tour group or anything else.",

You might need to do a little extra practice on your own (which Denison has resources to help you find) if you want to get applications of things down confidently, although that\u2019s totally up to you. Also, there are a ton of group projects, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing and it does a good job preparing you for the real world, but if you\u2019re the type who isnt good at working with other people be warned haha",

I am pretty average at math and stem, so I do not intend to enrol in science and math courses, although I might try Calc I. The APs I've took in high school are American History, European History, Human Geography, and Micro-economics. I am stronger in the social sciences.\n\nI really need a good GPA  and I was wondering if it's possible to get mostly As at Denison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

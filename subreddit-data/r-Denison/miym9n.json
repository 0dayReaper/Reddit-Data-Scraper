            "comment": "I was visiting another school the same weekend. I\u2019m from the Philly area, so definitely didn\u2019t want to drive 7 hours for one school visit. I was being recruited to row at the other school, so DU was a pretty distant second. Driving up the Hill, I\u2019m pretty sure I said \u2018oh shit\u2019 out loud. The campus is beautiful, that\u2019s what drew me in at first, but I knew it was a great school, and I knew it was a better opportunity than the other one I was looking at. People needed to ultimately talk me into it, but I\u2019ve never once regretted the decision. Speaking as an alum, (and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this a ton) the network strength of Denison cannot be exaggerated. It got me my first job. If you have any questions, shoot me a message!",

Denison is a smaller community, you feel like you know almost everyone on campus in your class. Leadership positions are abundant, the quality of education is amazing, and the opportunity to take a self directed initiative and turn it into a passion is ever-present. The community is great, location is amazing, and the educational structure really fits the demands of the workforce seeking college educated labor. It helps that the campus is absolutely gorgeous.",

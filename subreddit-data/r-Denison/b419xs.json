            "comment": "We wrote about hazing when we attended Denison.\n\nHazing. It\u2019s happened to all of us. It is a national treasure that is a tradition treasured by all Americans. But recently it has gone too far. With hazing rates staying fairly stagnant, we decided that an investigation was far overdue since the great hazing crisis of 2002.\n\nWe have decided to investigate the new underground fraternity Beta Gamma Omicron (B\u0393O). Upon investigation of their new hazing practices, we were shocked, appalled, traumatized, and a little turned on (in our pants area). The first horrific act that we witnessed through our heavy undercover study was the mean process of not getting picked. The second horrific act we heard through our friends was whittling the wheaklings. The B\u0393O\u2019s locked the young potential pledges in a room with seven handles of cranberry juice. They were told they couldn\u2019t leave until they finished all seven handles.\n\n\u201cOh it was just terrible- seven handles between the 12 of us. We couldn\u2019t take it! There was just so much cranberry juice and I personally found it to be bitter and harsh tasting. We all threw up then passed out,\u201d said recently outed B\u0393O pledge Sam \u201cSon of Sam\u201d Samson.\n\nThe third sickening act was when they took the pledges out to dinner (or should we say dinnerz).\n\n\u201cIt was great! All the brothers paid for dinner, it was delicious. Then after the dinner, the brothers put us in the backseat of the car, blindfolded themselves, and drove us to another restaurant,\u201d said Perry Pepperman, current member of B\u0393O.\n\nThen things started to turn bad. The new pledges were forced to eat eight full meals. At restaurants such as: Texas Roadhouse, Steak N Shake, Incredibles, Del Mar, Arby\u2019s, Nona, Dragon Buffet and Yoder\u2019s Country Style Kitchen (listed from best to worst meal).\n\n\u201cNot only did I puke several times after the meals, but I kept shitting fucks for weeks after,\u201d said Sam \u201cSon of Sam\u201d Samson.\n\nAfter our investigation we have decided that nothing bad has ever resulted from hazing. Thus, we conclude with these words: KEEP HAZIN\u2019, YOU\u2019RE AMAZIN\u2019!\n",

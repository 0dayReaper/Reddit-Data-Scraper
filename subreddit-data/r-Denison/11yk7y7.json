    "postText": "Hi everyone, so I was recently accepted into Denison and I was wondering what the Greek life was like. I looked on niche and saw it was pretty big but I\u2019ve read here that the school isn\u2019t a total party school. I was just looking for some insight to how the school was Greek wise and social life wise. Thank you!",

If you don\u2019t then you don\u2019t have to interact with them. It\u2019s def not a party school but I was surprised at how many people went out at first.\n\nThere are still plenty of other things you can join like clubs, sports and councils. I am a little dissapointed that there are quite a few cool clubs that don\u2019t really do much though.\n\nAnyways, if you want to party on a Friday or Saturday night you\u2019ll either end up at a frat party or a friends dorm. They only really control the party scene, (and compared to bigger schools it\u2019s tame) otherwise they do charity events and stuff like that.",

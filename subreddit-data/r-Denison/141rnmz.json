    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been accepted for the class of 27, but I didn\u2019t have a strong spring semester. I\u2019m not sure exactly what grade I will be receiving, but it could be a C of some sort\u2026\n\nMy gpa is about 3.5, and I got basically straight as and one B- last year.\n\nWill this C put my admission in jeopardy? How much do grades have to drop for them to begin to consider this? My other grades for the semester should be fine, but I\u2019m worried about this one class.",

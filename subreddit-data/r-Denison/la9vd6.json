Did you like the program? Do you feel it prepared you for the work force?  \n\nI\u2019m very curious about the job outcomes, the Denison website has some old statistics about jobs that are very vague (no median salary or anything) so any help would be appreciated!",

I know they collect outcome and salary data (because I filled out an outcome and salary data survey), I'd be shocked if they weren't willing to share it. \n\nAddressing your number one concern, job placement: \n\nDenison math, CS, and DA majors tend to do fine. Most of our majors don't make [180k right out of school](https://uw-se-2020-class-profile.github.io/profile.pdf) like they do at UWaterloo, but most CS majors that I know managed to find work as software engineers, most math majors I know are doing analyst kind of work at F500s, and most DA majors I know are doing data-y stuff (I know nothing about the data-y job market). I did better than most, here are a couple posts  ([post 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fd9bt2/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_new_grads/fjgrvle/?context=3), [post 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fd9bt2/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_new_grads/fjgscls/?context=3)) I made about my job search in the 2020 /r/cscareerquestions salary sharing thread (my job hunt went better than most folks', but I'm not a massive outlier I think).\n\nI know a couple CS students at FAANG or FAANG tier companies, but most end up somewhere in the midwest or Chicago. My impression is that DA majors tend to struggle a bit with finding jobs, but that's just an impression (any DA folks feel free to correct me)\n\nTl;dr: you'll do fine.",

Plenty of folks at FAANG (but also many doing important non-FAANG work and not selling their souls to the $$$ devil). There's a great focus on fundamentals and theory, and you're expected to do work that'll prep you for the job market yourself. Get an internship by between your sophomore and junior year, learn a lot, and prep for interviews (seriously a big part of the job search for CS). Unless you're a top 10 target school, school name doesn't really matter in our industry (honestly, having a degree doesn't really matter for many tech companies).\n\nIf you like learning a lot in a wide variety of classes, being surrounded by people who think differently (i.e. don't want to go to a tech institute or big state school), and getting to know your professors and fellow students well, Denison'll be great. Don't expect Denison to get you a job though\u2013\u2013it's a university, not a job mill.",

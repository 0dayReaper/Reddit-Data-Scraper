Mostly cause of how recently freshman dorms were renovated so recently, (they added air conditioning to Crawford the spring semester of my freshman year for example)\n\n\\-Shorney and Smith are very very close to a-quad while Crawford is one of the furthest dorms from a-quad so you'll need to be ready to walk\n\n\\-You'll have a good time no matter where you live so honestly don't stress about it very much, I just thought I'd post this so you guys could have an idea of what to expect\n\n\\-Any questions feel free to ask! I'll try and answer quickly (although it is finals for me so I've been a bit busy)",

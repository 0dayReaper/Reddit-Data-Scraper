Also the fact that the university is a liberal arts college is kinda scaring me because I've seen leople on the internet saying a CS major from a liberal arts college is worthless. How true is that?",

He got a very good internship the summer before senior year, and was hired in software engineering before he graduated ($80k to start)\nOur career center (\u201cKnowlton center\u201d) helps a lot with internships, coaching etc, and our students do well - they also have skills that employers want like collaborative problem solving, good writing and oral communication etc",

I would give you an email for a student but I don\u2019t know any majors because I\u2019m just not in that circle. Ask the department head for some TAs\u2019 or fellows\u2019 emails and im sure they\u2019d be glad to pass them along",

The classes are nice and slow so everyone catches up however in the beginning towards the end of the semester everything starts to ramp up pretty quickly. If i were you having good knowledge of some language will tremendously help and make these classes much more easier. I really recommend the CS department they are very nice and caring and help you to secure a job for the future!",

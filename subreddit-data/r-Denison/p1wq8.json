The tape was tall enough for all cars to pass under with no problem, but most of the sorority girls were stupid enough to stop and try to back all the way up and go down the side road. Once they stopped, we had them. One of my buddies got it through a sun roof, into the lap of one of the drivers and spilled her coffee all over the place. It was fantastic.",

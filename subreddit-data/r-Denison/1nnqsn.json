    "postText": "I recently visited the Denison campus and I was pretty impressed with it. The campus was beautiful, everyone seemed nice, and the facilities were excellent.\n\nI am considering applying, but before I do I had a few questions about the college that I wanted some feedback from real students on. Answer as many or few as you feel comfortable with.\n\n1. How does a small liberal arts school in the middle of Ohio build up a 700 million endowment?\n\n2. What is the drinking/drug culture at the school like?\n\n3. What exactly is the Denison bubble?\n\n4. When I was visiting, I read The Denisonian and it seemed like a disproportionate number of articles were about things like rape culture and sexual assault. I also know that 60% of the population of Denison is female and there is a large Womens Studies major. None of these things by themselves is an issue, but I feel like they point to a problem a lot of colleges have where a large feminist movement can dominate the public discussion. To what degree is this true at Denison?\n\n5. What is there to do on weekends? I heard that 96% of students stay on campus.\n\n6. Is there anything important I should consider about Denison that isn't in the tour/reading materials?\n\nI know some of these seem like hardball questions, but I feel like the best way to get a feel for colleges is to ask real students about their experience actually going there, rather than just asking my tour guide questions or reading pamphlets.

            "comment": "This is just one perspective, but a lot of these are directly related. After visiting, 2 things should have immediately been clear. There are a lot of people with money, and it's located in the middle of nowhere. \n\nFirst off, the endowment is so big because there are a lot of graduates and people's families throwing plenty of money at the school. They will also call everyone and their mother to try to get you to donate. \n\nThe \"Denison Bubble\" is used to describe the enclosed upper-middle class experience that you won't find once you leave campus. Think along the lines of a nice gated community located in the middle of a county stricken with poverty. That's basically Denison, although there are no gates and even less security. Things on campus get trashed quite often... but it's cleaned up by the time you go to class. A utopia of sorts. \n\nAs for the other questions, there really isn't much to do in the middle of rural Ohio, so people take drugs and drink. A lot. People can afford to become alcoholics, often supporting their friends' habits as well. Many drank long before attending Denison because their parents didn't say no. Therefore, they didn't learn what \"no\" meant and you get your answer to #4. This isn't only one-sided though. Guys are often blamed for the rapes, but Denison girls dress in next to nothing and drink until they can't remember.\n\nFor #6, I'd say watch any movie about \"college\" and you'll get a pretty good idea of what to expect. The tours and literature are written by the administration, but haven't exactly been on *great* terms with the students. The education is pretty good if you get the right professors, but they tend to hire from less-desirable grad schools as well. The biggest thing you might want to be aware of is the drama. Since it's such a small school AND no one leaves campus (for more than a few hours), people get on each other's nerves. The biggest problems seem to be when the administration or police get involved. \n\nIf you lump it all together like this, it seems pretty terrible. In reality, you can feel pretty safe on campus. A surprising amount of students have to learn common sense when they get to the hill, and the \"bubble\" is there to give you a chance to grow up without going to jail. People do have money, but not everyone's a jerk about it. The big donations make it so less-fortunate kids can still make it to Denison. You will meet some of the most interesting people in the world there, but you'll have to look. The drinking and parties are tons of fun as long as you don't overdo it. ",

                    "comment": "There is less partying here than most public schools in Ohio (OSU, Ohio, BG, Kent etc), but more partying than places like Oberlin or Wooster. I think that saying people take \"a lot\" of drugs is a bit exaggerated. \n\n\nAnd your bit on rape is a little speculative. Like, you're making some pretty specific accusations about a big group of people. (People here didn't learn how to say \"no\" so they rape..?)\n\n\n\nBut other than that I agree with you.",

Compared to the other schools I have visited, Denison is still probably #1 for now, and I haven't even asked students from the other schools the tough questions yet.",

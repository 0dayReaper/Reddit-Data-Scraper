And no, not the ENTIRE population of 2016 are \"dumb-asses\". Like in every class, there are those who fuck things up for everyone else and give the class a bad name. This does not mean that the class as a whole should be receiving the blame, or putting their lives at risk by these Wingless Angels.",

I'm sorry if that wasn't clear enough in my statement, I'm definitely not saying that it was the class' own fault. No one deserves treatment like that. One again, I'm sorry for any confusion there, but I have nothing against the Denison class of 2016, just this year's group of Wingless Angels.",

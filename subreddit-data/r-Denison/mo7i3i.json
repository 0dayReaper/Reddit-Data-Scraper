I heard that they accept about half of all applications, but everyone I know who applied was accepted, so who knows lol. \n\nNot to cast aspersions, but some of the folks who got accepted the summer I did research were... not the sharpest crayons in the box, so I don't think the bar is super-duper high. \n\nMake sure that the professor you'll be working with is enthusiastic about working with you and you'll probably be fine, they write half the application after all!",

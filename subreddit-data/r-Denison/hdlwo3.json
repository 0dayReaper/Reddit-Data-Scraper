            "comment": "1) partying is how you make it, tbh. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the status quo of party culture, so my friends and I started throwing our own. I don\u2019t personally like going to frat parties because they\u2019re all the same: but some of the multi-cultural organizations throw bangers that I couldn\u2019t recommend more. \n\n2) from my point of view, there isn\u2019t a hierarchy: but there are sororities and frats that do try and make them: i.e. I am dating a former tri-delta and she said they do a lot of shit talking together of other sororities and it\u2019s just kinda the norm. All you have to know is that KKG, the sorority, is full of nice girls but are always lowest on the fictional \u201chierarchy\u201d scale because, well, they\u2019re nice girls I guess idk. As far as fears go, they all suck in their own way, but I guess Beta and Lambda are the most ok- I could honestly compare them to Joe Biden: like I guess it\u2019s the best we\u2019re gonna get even tho they suck. The historically black, latinx, and asian frats and sororities are all awesome and I have 0 issues with them. But like in my opinion, Greek life is a toxic institution and schools would be better without them. \n\n3) snagels are an acquired taste: so I\u2019ll leave that up to you to find out. \n\n4) Homestead fucking rocks I love it there. Used to date a girl who lived there and I had so much fun visiting and interacting with the community. I helped with a lot of yard work and cooked a ton: 10/10 would recommend. Living there tho: lots of drama that\u2019s for sure. I am glad I was apart of it from afar. \n\n5) if you\u2019re a hard worker and have med-school ambitions: you\u2019ll get in. Anyone can get into med school as long as your grades are high and your mcat is solid. Denison does prep you for the mcat in a way and all my friends who wanted to go to Med school are going this fall. \n\n6) traditions: well I started one 4 years ago called \u201cSeptember Fest\u201d, which is like one of the biggest parties of the year now. It\u2019s basically a night where you dance to groovy 70s-90s tunes and September by Earth Wind and Fire plays every 15-20 min. I\u2019m bias, but that\u2019s my fav. I also really enjoy naked week, earth day, and the Granville Christmas Market (even tho I\u2019m jewish). \n\nTraditions I hate: the frats throw this \u201caround the world\u201d party where they all have a party and dress up as a culture from around the world. Like even tho they mostly do white European countries, it\u2019s kinda racist and pretty dumb. Just do decades like holy shit why do we have to be problematic. Really anything that\u2019s a frat tradition is typically problematic in one way or another so I\u2019m against all of them. \n\nBut yeah there ya go: I am a recent grad so I got 4 years of experience but take what I say with a grain of salt. Being apart of Greek life isn\u2019t a bad thing, in my opinion, but supporting the institution is, also in my opinion. Nothing good really comes out of a room full of masculine 18-22 year old men who all look the same.",

            "comment": "I'm a current rising junior, so here's what I have to say! \n\n1. wht is the party scene like overall (where do students of all grade levels tend to party, do they follow the new rules, ragers v relaxed, etc)?\n\nYes, there's a decent amount of parties so I'd say that our party scene Def exists lol but I'm not sure what rona will change because we haven't been back on campus yet. Many people have parties outdoor on beaver beach and in some dorms like Shaw, beaver, craw (basically any not quiet housing dorm). There's also Lamson Lodge Sunset Lounge, Frat basements, Moines, and lots of people just party/drink/have music with a handful of friends in their dorm. Do not do this in a freshman dorm. Parties in senior apartments specificly are considerably less common because the buildings aren't good from it, so there's some there but they're much more exclusive so don't wander up thinking you'll get in. There's also new senior apartments, not sure what the party scene will be like in those they aren't completed yet but will be when fall semester starts. \n\n\n\n2. wht are the most \"popular\" fraternities and sororities (is there act the hiearchy)?\n\nI'd say the hierarchy more exists from the perspective of people not in Greek life. Once you join one like I did that idea sorta goes away, and all of the orgs are pretty great in their own ways. Just don't be a dunbass and try to rush an underground frat. Some rumors you here are more true then you might think. If you rush with a mentality of \"X house is the only house I want bc they're \"top tier\" they will pick up in that. Just be respectful and nice to whatever houses invite you back, no matter where you end up I'm sure you'll find friends and a connection and if not you can drop and find your place with others on campus. \n\n\n3. are snagels worth the hype?\n\nTbh get one with friends! Don't go to the snatch alone because you'll be the only loner and it gets boring real fast lol. I think it's fine but in general it takes ages to get food there (because there's ever only 2-3 staff, all students) so try it but go with friends so you can socialize in the meantime. \n\n\n4. do ppl enjoy staying at the homestead (ive always been curious)?\n\nEveryone I know at the homestead is one of those eco-life weed smokers. Not a bad thing but don't live or visit if you don't enjoy walking a couple miles in the snow to get to your 9am class and eating dinner with people lighting it up around you. It's a fun place, totally isn't for me but people love it. \n\n\n5. do ppl get into med school from denison, is it common?\n\nI'd say yes, there's a decent amount of people who get in but I'm not sure the exact numbers. It is pretty hard to get in ofc so take that with a grain of salt.  \n\n6. wht traditions are unique/whats ur fav?\n\nGaming Guild does two pretty small cons on campus, that's always fun. They've done that for the past few years and I enjoy going with friends. I also like the LNO and Hilltoper performances, they usually do one every so often (almost every month or so?) on different quads and I don't attend all of them because if you see them once you see them all, but it's a little comforting and nice walking around campus to your classmates singing and people cheering!",

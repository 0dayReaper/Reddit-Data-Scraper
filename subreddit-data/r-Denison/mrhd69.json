Right now it\u2019s at $9.25/hr, administration told some students they were raising it to $9.50/hr, the students said it wasn\u2019t enough and announced their demands for an $11/hr wage and admin cam back with $10/hr, so we\u2019ll see what it is soon. \n\nTo my knowledge yes you do have to be a sophomore to become a CA (community advisor Denison\u2019s version of RA). You get your room paid for from this position",

    "postText": "Hey. I was thinking of applying here from GA Southern due to the fact that I dont really fit in at Southern. Its hot &amp; people only care about partying &amp; getting drunk which is cool, just not when its EVERYONE. Im a really chill, hippie type, stoner deep thinker &amp; I was trying to see if Id fit here. Really into philosophy &amp; questioning the universe. How is the student body? Is it racist here? Is it homophobic? Do you feel you fit in? ",

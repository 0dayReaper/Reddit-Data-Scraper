Entirely apocryphal, but here goes:\n\nFor whatever reason, two Denison students make a drunken plan to streak down the hill, around the old opera house, and back. They have the bad fortune to run directly in front of the only cop in town, who throws them in the back of the car. He drives them back to the station (all of one block at that point) telling them how much shit they're in. When they get there, he lets them out, looks them up and down, and tells them to run their naked asses back up the hill as fast as they can. \n\nThe End (as told to me by a 70+ year old lifelong Granville resident while we were discussing how the cops aren't as nice as they used to be)   ",

    "postText": "hey, I got into the spring semester for 2023. I plan to pursue Computer Science and had the following questions:\n\n1. Can you defer a semester so that I start in the Fall instead of the Spring - I really do not want to start in the Spring Semester.\n2. My intended major is Computer Science - how are the CS department and the professors here, and how are the research and employment opportunities?\n3. How is the social scene in and around the campus and what are some fun things to do here? What is the general vibe of the college?\n4. What is the overall reputation of Denison in general particularly in the STEM field?\n5. What is the average number of courses that you take in a single semester - is the course rigorous and time-consuming and hard to manage? Is it easy to double major?",

It appears I am not the outlier either as the median scores for multiple tests have been Ds or Fs. Then again, I have only taken this one CS course in my entire life but in general I hear that the CS professors come and go. Now, I am shifting to DA because to me it is a lot easier. Rather than defining functions and learning how to develop algorithms like in CS, DA is using those functions to analyze data for real world application and develop insights. \n\nOh and in regards to spring semester, I happen to be part of the first spring semester group ever and it\u2019s not so bad.",

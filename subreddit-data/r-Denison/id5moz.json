Also without funds in the endowment there is no revenue generated from the investment, so you want to dip as little as possible. Denison's endowment has performed incredibly well in the last decades. \n\nPart of the financial and administrative landscape is tenured profs are more expensive, etc. also Denison has been heading in some new directions lately, and maybe they're seizing this opportunity to restructure some academic and administrative areas to support growth in new ones. Not saying that's a good idea, but it is *a* idea.",

The problem is that if the structure of our endowment does not allow for a rapid liquidation of some assets to cover a short term crunch, then we can't rely on the endowment during a crisis. This could radically change the college overnight for the worse because funds were unavailable. I don't think the situation is that dire, but what's the point of an endowment if a significant portion of it can't be used as a safety net? COVID is causing havoc now, but with continuing climate change, one byproduct is an increase in viral/bacterial pandemics. In the next 20-30 years I would wager we see another pandemic with similar repercussions (worse or not as severe I don't know). Also, why are professors being pressured in early retirement and hearing rumors of department eliminations WHILE the college raises a record $225 million? It's not a good sign.\n\nOn a more personal note, I feel Denison has become too administrated (for lack of a better word in my vocabulary), at the expense of what makes a college a college: professors and students. I have seen Denison add more administration positions that I feel are redundant, expensive, and unnecessary (and each one costs more than a tenured professor). I don't want to point out which department my gf's mom is in because nothing is concrete, just conjecture right now, but it's a department that's rather core to the liberal arts philosophy. On the student end we are seeing a big change in aid offered by the college. While the total number of scholarships hasn't changed, the total amount of scholarship money has been reduced by the Board even as tuition continues to rise. This will in effect change the makeup of our student body, and I think is another bad move for the future of Denison. Both of these I think are contradictory to Denison's goal of becoming a top liberal arts school among the likes of Bowdoin, Amherst, or Swathmore.  \n\nAnyways, sorry for the rant.",

It's literally one of the worst places that people *could* go at this point in time. No way this lasts until October, and then you're gonna have a ton of out-of-state (and maybe out of country) students scrambling to get home. Folks are going to be quarantined and isolated in their rooms\u2013\u2013it's just not going to be fun. What a horrid money grab. This whole stunt is pretty antithetical to Denison's mission to be autonomous thinkers and discerning moral agents\u2013\u2013you'd think someone would step in and point out the awful ethical mistake here.\n\nOh well.",

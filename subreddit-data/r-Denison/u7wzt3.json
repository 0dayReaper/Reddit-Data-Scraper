    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a prospective student and I was wondering what the support is like for executive functioning here? I tend to have trouble focusing, I procrastinate, and sometimes I can get pretty far behind on work. For students with these types of struggles, what is the support like here? Are teachers understanding or helpful if you get behind? Is it common for students to form study groups?\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t have ADHD, so I won\u2019t have access to disability services or test accommodations.",

            "comment": "What I like about our Econ dept is that there is a wide variety of viewpoints from different schools of economic thought. While I think MMT theory is weak at best, one of its champions, Kaboub, is in our department. Research is also a strong option for many students as well. My favorite professors where Quentin Duroy, Xiao Jiang, and Luis Villanueva, mostly as I was able to form close relationships with them. We still speak once every few months.\n\nBeyond that, Economics is one of the largest majors at Denison, with many people going into finance (like myself, though I left after I realized it wasn't for me), politics, and others going on to PhD and Masters programs at schools such as Havard, Columbia, NYU, Stanford, Michigan, MIT, etc. If you are looking for internship opportunities and what Denison has to offer, speak to Denison's career advancement center and ask them what they have to offer. It was very useful for me as a student. I was able to land my finance job through a Denison alumni connection. The PPE (philosophy, political science, economics) degree program is also a highlight of Denison, many students in that end up in Law School or politics.",

    "postText": "So I'm experiencing a dilemma.  I really like Denison (especially because of the cost lol) but I also really like Northeastern. If you had the choice, where would you commit to? At both universities, I'd major in either IR or Psychology. What opportunities are there at Denison for internships and study abroad?",

            "comment": "A bachelor\u2019s in IR and/or psychology doesn\u2019t really offer you a clear career to exit into.  IR probably points you toward an MBA or JD, and psychology maybe points you toward an MBA, JD, Psy.D, MSW, or PhD. If you\u2019re set on majoring in IR or psych, you\u2019ll want to keep the grad-school exit in mind.  So go with whichever school offers you the lowest costs and best potential for a high GPA.  That way you: (1) won\u2019t have too much undergrad debt on top of your grad school debt; and (2) you maximize your ability to get into a good grad school possibly with scholarship.\n\nMost study abroad opportunities are done through outside institutions, and the credits are then \u201ctransferred\u201d back to Denison (or Northeastern).\n\nInternship opportunities are probably about the same at either.  Though, Boston would probably be a more competitive market than the midwestern cities.",

            "comment": "Size is a very important variable here. Denison is 2,200 students, Northeastern is 10x that. I was deciding between Miami (OH) and Denison, and ended up deciding Denison on a gut check. It was, thankfully, the best move. Being at Denison means you have more opportunity for leadership, research, and extra curricular activities to really thrive in a campus environment. I went Econ / Bio (Pre-Med) as a double major, and was able to perform research in both subjects as the lead author (though unpublished, but that is a reflection on me, not the school). In addition, I was able to play sports, hold other leadership roles, and even become apart of a local community off campus which resulted in an incredibly diverse CV for grad and med school. \n\nInternships: Plenty. If you are interested, call our admissions office and ask for information on that. Denison has connections anywhere, and even helped me land my first job out of college in a state and city that I wanted to live in, not one where I just happened to get an offer (as an investment banker, I have had a very unorthodox path to med school). The internship office is able to find opportunities in any city you wish to go to, and will do their best to help you be a competitive applicant. Our good alumni relations often means you can end up working for an alum. \n\nStudy abroad is available to really anyone who wants it. I chose not to as I took time off from college to live in South America, but I still had the chance to do so despite my double major. Most people go Junior year for one semester, and the cost is usually a touch lower than a semester at Denison (depends on how good your scholarship is).  Again, the admissions office is an excellent resource for info on study abroad.  \n\nI would strongly suggest you contact your admissions rep at Denison (you should be able to find online, or just send an email to the office and they will direct you). They will have so much more information than we can provide here.",

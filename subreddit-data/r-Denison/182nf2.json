    "postText": "Not much discussion on here, so let's talk about party registration. Have you registered a party? How'd it go? Was security reasonable? Do you think it'll help campus climate in the way the administration intended? Any thoughts from alumni?\n\nI personally haven't registered a party yet, the only time my room had one I was out of town, but from what I heard from them it seemed that security mostly kept their distance and only checked in once to make sure there weren't any issues. I was on DCGA when party registration was first proposed a few years ago, and it originally was supposed to reward registered parties with later quiet hours, and was intended to serve as a step in the direction of allowing kegs on campus, though it seems that its implementation now is more defensive in the face of all that shit last semester rather than proactive in allowing students more freedoms with accountability.\n\nHave at it!",

            "comment": "I registered a party. It was pretty simple. Security and the RA came and checked on everything and then left us alone for the rest of the night. I also had an unregistered, spur of the moment \"party\" (we had way more than 15 people, loud music, yelling, etc) one night and we didn't get shut down or even talked to by security.\n\nI think the original idea was a good one (extended quiet hours-kegs-etc), but the way they implemented the system seems almost like a step back.  I guess I can see the safety benefits to an extent, but it mostly seems like the administration is making us jump through hoops. ",

Granted, I mostly partied in Columbus, but I went to my fair share of campus parties and hosted a few, but i have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n\nEdit: also, I remember the keg issue being a thing when I was on campus. Our DCGA members wrote into the bullsheet about it, or maybe other students, I forget.  But when the wingless angels lit a keg on fire on east quad, I feel like that was counter productive. Again, I partied a lot in Columbus, so I'm not the best denisonian to ask, but still  ",

                    "comment": "It just started this semester.  Last semester, there was a bit of a issue with drinking on campus.  Apparently, people partied hard the weekend before Halloween and an unusually high number of students were taken to the hospital in ambulances.  This was a problem because there were not enough ambulances to service Granville when something happened in town.  They formed a committee to talk about it and the result was that we now need to register parties if there will be alcohol and more than 15 people present.\n\nAs for OP's question, we had a Super Bowl party that we had to register.  There are some things that I was ok with.  I get the needing to have non-alcoholic beverages available (and this can literally be solo cups and a water faucet), and I get the whole having a little food at the party so the alcohol doesn't hit so hard.  Security was pretty chill, and the guy who checked on everything already looked bored with the whole thing.  They didn't check on us at all when the party was going, though that was probably because it was obvious that it was a sit around with the lights on and drink kind of party and not a lights off everybody grind on each other kind of party.\n\nHere's what I'm not cool with.  I don't understand why the \"host\" and the \"server\" BOTH need to be 21.  Can't just one of them be 21?  I also think that it's stupid that they have to be covered by two different people.  I think that someone can handle being the person who lives in the room and bar tending and the same time.  I also don't like that they had to be afraid of drinking in their own apartment just in case they get caught (they aren't supposed to drink, though that didn't stop them).  I also think it's dumb that a first year can't be the door guard (or as we called her, the \"bouncer\"--ours had fun with this one, had a costume and a list :P).  We should totally be allowed to draft second semester first years for that gig.\n\n",

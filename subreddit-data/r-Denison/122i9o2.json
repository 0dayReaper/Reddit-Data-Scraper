To me the exam was quite easy, and I got placed into multivariable, (If I remember correctly I only missed one problem, which was just me forgetting a geometry formula, not calculus). To give context, I got a 5 on the calc AB exam and a 4 on the calc BC exam. If you did well on those exams you\u2019ll pretty much definitely get placed in multivariable calculus as well without any difficulty - I didn\u2019t even study for mine.\n\nI\u2019m a current student, and I\u2019ve taken a lot of math courses here, so if you have any more questions about anything on campus or anything in the math/computer science departments feel free to ask me anything!",

In the end I'm glad, because going from the hardest classes at my high school to the easiest classes at college made my transition to Denison a lot easier and definitely lowered my stress level coming. My advice is to use any credits you have to skip some low-level gen ed credits. However, I wouldn't try to apply credits to your major, as often times majors are built around specific intro classes that are designed to lead you into the methods and materials used by the department with a cohort of your peers, and this can be an invaluable experience to have in order to orient yourself within your department!",

Don't expect to coast once you start college, but if you were able to keep up with IB, then your first couple of semesters may be easier for you than for your peers.\n\nHowever, don't let this comfort you too much, because as you get deeper into classes in your area(s) of interest, classes will get more work intensive and require more time and attention. I would recommend using your first year or so when things are easier to become involved with clubs and groups, meet friends and establish yourself socially, as it becomes much harder to do these things once your major picks up. \n\nA final thought is that upper level classes, especially within your major, aren't made easy or hard by the workload, they're made easy or hard by your interest in them. It's easy to do a 20 page reading and take detailed notes in lectures for a class you really love, but trying to motivate yourself to learn about something you simply don't care about is extremely difficult and the easiest way to get burnt out on school. The best way to avoid this would be to give yourself 'treat' classes if you can manage it in your schedule, classes that you don't need to take to graduate, but they'll be on the easier side here.\n\nSorry I wandered away from your question a bit, just some advice from a recent alum :)",

All of the professors who I worked with were not only dedicated and passionate scientists, but also true educators with a passion for teaching. The class sizes (never more than about 20 students) meant that developing relationships with professors is almost inevitable, which also makes it that much easier to ask them questions and attend office hours outside of classroom settings. Additionally, each stem department provides research opportunities during both the summer and school year. These positions can be fairly competitive, but also very rewarding, and an excellent leg up if you're looking to go into grad school later on.",

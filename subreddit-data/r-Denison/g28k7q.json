    "postText": "Hi guys, \n\nI was accepted into Denison about a month ago, with a merit scholarship of $21k USD a year, without need aid. This would set my eventual fees (with room &amp; board) down to roughly $50k USD, which is still considerably expensive. I understand that $21k is already significantly generous but it only covers a small pie of the fees.\n\nI guess what I wanted to ask here is, for admitted/enrolled students, how much of aid/package are you guys receiving? As well as is $50k usd still worth the cost? \n\nI'm also searching for any advice/suggestions for ways to ask for a higher financial aid package.",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm no longer enrolled at Denison, but as an alum, I feel I can confidently say no undergraduate education (not even Ivy League schools) is worth paying $50k a year (esp if you have to go into debt for it). Denison's pretty great, but $50k/year is absurd. I came out with about $35k in debt from Denison, and even that feels debilitating.\n\nMy advice to you as an old and cranky person is to follow the money for your education while still getting what you want out of school. Good luck!",

I'm still wondering if there's any way I could ask for more financial aid from them however.\n\nAlso, its just that I'm an international student, and if I do attend anywhere else its probably going to end up to be somewhere around that price if I do attend... But i'm not sure if I should choose my own local university (with the COVID-19 situation) or continue to pursue an education overseas",

    "postText": " Hi guys! International here who is considering ED 2 to Denison.  \nI studied under the British GCSE system. I'm applying to the US but my situation is tricky. During my O levels, I had 8 subjects including Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Maths, English Language, English Literature, and Sociology. These are the equivalent of the first 2 years of high school in America. My cumulative GPA was around 3.5-3.6. I come from a low-income background, and I've had to deal with a lot of issues at home that, during that time period, made it quite difficult for myself.   \nAlthough over the course of my A levels I have improved. These are equivalent to the final 2 years of high school in America. Here, I had 4 courses: Sociology, World History, English, and Economics. I received an A\\*, A, A, and B.   \nClass Rank:   Economics: top 40%, World History: top 10%, Sociology: top 20%, English: top 3% School does not provide overall class rank.   \nI gave the December SAT and received a 1370.  \n I have a substantial number of ECs. Notably, I have written and presented my own research paper on the deficiencies of the public schooling system in my country. During my O level years, I was student council president and continued to be a student council member as well as captain of the Model United Nations society during my A levels. I have won an international award at the Harvard Model UN in Boston. Moreover, I've worked extensively with a local NGO for the empowerment of girls' education in my country, as well as having co-founded a public cleanup campaign. Lastly, I'm also a published contributor to a well-respected news publication in my city.   \nMy EFC would be about $5000, unfortunately, this is all I can muster. I know that Denison does meet 100% need, but I don't know how generous the school really will be. I really like what Denison has to offer and I feel I would fit in well.  \nWith this in mind, do you think it would still be worthwhile for me to apply?",

Some people have been quite skeptical of this decision, I'm not entirely sure what to make of it. However, I felt I really like what Denison has to offer and I'm fairly hopeful it was the right choice!",

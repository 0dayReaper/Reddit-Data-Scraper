My advice to you is look up specific scholarships Denison offers and allude to one you think you are qualified for in your essay or in your interview. I got a great scholarship here and I'm 90% certain the only reason I was even considered for it was because I mentioned it in my essat.",

Now, \"demonstrated need\" might be a technical term connected to FAFSA, etc., which means it might not be enough for any given family to send their kid to Denison. But it does show you that Denison works really, really hard to get the students they want and help them afford the school. So the answer to your question is \"very good.\"",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nI am starting my first grad semester CSUSB this fall and was wondering about parking. My classes are going to be at 5pm or later most nights, so I was wondering what I should do. Should I buy a parking permit? I will be going to campus 3 days  a week, so I wasn't  sure if it was worth buying the permit or just paying for the daily parking rate. Any help or advice is appreciated!",

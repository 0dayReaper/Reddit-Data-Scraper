If so do you have to retake the General Ed classes or no? \n\nAnyway, who would I contact in order to get more info? TYIA!",

            "comment": "It's generally a terrible idea to get a second bachelors degree after graduation because (1) it's a lot more expensive, (2) is often more work than getting a masters degree, and (3) doesn't help you nearly as much as a graduate degree.\n\nA teacher with a masters degree usually gets paid more and can find jobs easier, since the education level is part of the pay range calculation of all public schools.\n\nThe answer to your second question is also a good reason to not attempt a 2nd bachelors degree because often you will have to retake some General Ed classes for no good reason, simply because GE requirements not only change over time, but the GE requirements can be different from the 2nd degree you take vs. the one you already have.\n\nGetting a 2nd degree in Spanish won't actually help you as much as you think to become a Spanish teacher.   What you should really be doing is pursuing a single-subject or multi-subject teaching credential.   A single-subject credential in Spanish would only qualify you for teaching that one subject, but you could find it much easier to find a reliable position if you also could teach in bilingual classes, English as a second-language (ESL), and adult learning classes in Regional Occupation Schools, community colleges, and as a lecturer at universities.   This flexibility could help you find work almost anywhere using your skills.\n\nGetting into a high school as a Spanish language teacher may be very difficult if the positions are already filled with young teachers that have higher seniority than you do.  If you can get into the school with a related subject, then you can be well positioned to be hired when an opening becomes available, since the administration will already know you and your history.  You'll be a known-quantity that's much easier to hire with low risk.\n\nSo you have a good idea for your career plans, just the way you're currently planning is not such a good approach.   Go for a graduate level teaching credential.   You may also qualify for loans that can be forgiven based on years of service teaching is schools that need qualified teachers.",

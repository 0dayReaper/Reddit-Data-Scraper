It goes into more detail, but I will let you read it, and if you agree please sign it. Thank you all!",

I was reaching out to both students and staff. I'm only reaching out to CSUSB students and staff and no one else, not sure how to block people outside csusb from signing the petition though, but I'm only posting it in csusb channels. I can completely support the idea that some students may feel they're not getting their moneys worth going remote and that is why it says to have the option for students to choose to go in-person or stay remote. \n\nI really appreciate your questions. This is mostly coming from the Computer Science Major side but I believe all students should have this option during the rise in covid cases.\n\nThis would also allow better social distancing for the professors/staff and for the students who wish to choose the in-person option.",

Think about the total student population and have a idea of a percentage you want to present to the president. 100 students out of ~1800 is about 5.55% of the total student population. More is obviously better. \n\nIt'd also be good to see the data about GPA/grades/retention. If students' GPAs went down year over year b/c of remote, you might have a difficult case. Go to CSUSB institutional research then go to the data dash board and look at the stats. Arm yourself.\n\nWhat will hurt most is in the pockets though. If students spend more while remote your in a good position.",

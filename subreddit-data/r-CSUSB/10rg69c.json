Do you get the Pell grant or anything else that's already paying for your tuition? The middle class scholarship only got awarded to me once when I messed up my Fasfa that year, and they said because I wasn't getting the Pell grant that the middle class scholarship was the next best one. But as soon as there was another grant/funding available they switched me over because they said it was more money than the middle class scholarship. As far as I know, you can't have both forms of funding, and the middle class scholarship isn't even enough to fully cover tuition. The semester that I had it, I still owed money and had a balance left over for what the scholarship didn't cover. \n\nSo I guess I'm asking if people are even able to use the middle class scholarship if they already have another grant/funding ? That extra money would be super helpful to me but I was always under the impression that you can only have one",

I only got my regular refund that I normally get from what's left over after the pell grant. I thought the email saying I was eligible for Mcs was a mistake tbh. Supposedly you can't be on both forms of funding. I would just call financial aid and ask them to clear it up, I'll be doing that too because I'm super confused on it.",

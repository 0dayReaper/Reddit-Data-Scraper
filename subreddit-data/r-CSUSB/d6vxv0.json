    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a recent transfer to CSUSB from a CC. Yesterday was my first day and what a day it was. The campus is beautiful and so alive. Now onto my question, I visited the gym yesterday and set up my palm reading to enter the gym. My only concern is, I can only go to the gym in a small break I have between class. I don\u2019t want to leave my backpack in my car since I have a MacBook. Is there any lockers in the gym to store my backpack? If so do I need to bring my own locker?",

It's a great resource, definitely use it \n\nAlso to add to the above answer, there are free-to-use day lockers that lock, and open with a code on a receipt just past the towel checkout.",

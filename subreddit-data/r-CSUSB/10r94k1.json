I know plenty of students that feel like the school system doesn\u2019t care about them. If I can be the one person who offers a child kind words and a chance to know that they are valued, then that\u2019s what it\u2019s about for me. I am also interested in medical social work in a hospital setting, working with people from all different socioeconomic statuses. From what I understand about the program, there is no offered concentration but they instead offer a well-rounded curriculum to prepare students for any concentration they choose. Are you two-year track? My school days are Tu/Th.",

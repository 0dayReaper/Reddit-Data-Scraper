These PowerPoints are what you need to study for exams.\n2. Quiz yourself everyday. Part of the test is written, while the other half is MC. The written part can ask you to fill out a diagram. \n3. The material isn\u2019t hard in my opinion. It\u2019s just a lot to memorize. She also has office hours which are helpful.\n4. For lab you will have a laboratory manual you will need to buy. It\u2019s 80 dollars I think. You can have mine if you want. Make sure you study it everyday. The lab exam will be on the stuff you learned during cat dissections and anatomy models.",

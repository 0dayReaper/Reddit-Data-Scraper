I always, always, always ate off-campus because I found all the on-campus options to be a terrible value, overpriced and under delivered on quality and quantity.\n\nCSUSB on-campus food options are terrible compared to every other CSU campus in SoCal.   It's sad.\n\nI suggest planning to go off-campus, period.  Everything is better: selection, price, quality, hours, availability, service....you name it.   Fortunately, everything is usually close enough to be worthwhile for the trip off-campus.",

Starbucks (Library) is always crowded) and it is similarly priced.  Coyote Commons (all the way to the right of campus) has a food court that is never open when I can go.  I actually just prefer a cheap coffee from the red vending machine and sushi from the coyote market.  If nothing else, go off campus.",

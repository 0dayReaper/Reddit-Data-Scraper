Their website says no pets, but also asks if there will be pets when you\u2019re filling out an application so I\u2019m confused \ud83d\ude10",

One roommate has her bf squatting there and is extremely abusive/hostile to everyone else. Cops are usually called, but don't do a lot. Another roommate will confront people about stealing their things, though they are rather fond of stealing your things instead. I also had a friend who lived there last year. They had roommates that would constantly break into their car/unit. Their downstairs roommate was eventually evicted after they tried to intimidate another roommate with a gun.\n\nManagement is pretty much non-existent. It seems like there's a new manager every month and the best they will do is offer to break your lease or switch you to another unit. They will absolutely NOT address the real problem or deal with roommates who are threatening in any way. It was a miracle the roommate with the gun got evicted, but according to my friend, they were still hesitant to do anything. \n\nI have heard from some people in other units that they have good roommates, but most people I speak to have similar situations like the one my partner has to deal with. \n\nOf course, the Glenn has other problems, but the roommate situation is so awful/toxic that you'll always be stressed and never be able to relax or focus on school/work, etc.",

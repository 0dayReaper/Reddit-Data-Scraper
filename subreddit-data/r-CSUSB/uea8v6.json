It's a college marketplace restricted to students so you need to log in with your user@**csusb.edu** email . You can buy, or sell anything you want to other students, ranging from dorm supplies, textbooks, lost&amp; found, storage space, tutoring, apparel (anything really!) ride-sharing, to subleasing or finding off-campus housing for next year ...\n\nThe app is free, a lot of hard work went into it so make sure you check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters or you want to sublease for a summer!\n\niOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/college-souk/id1560441766](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/college-souk/id1560441766) \n\nandroid: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collegesouk.souk&amp;hl=en\\\\\\_US&amp;gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collegesouk.souk&amp;hl=en%5C_US&amp;gl=US)\n\nTell your friends also follow on ig for support \ud83d\ude0a https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/\n\nLastly, please go ahead and list something! People are already using it :) I really hope it helps (upvote for visibility)! - might be a little glitchy on galaxy hoping to fix that soon",

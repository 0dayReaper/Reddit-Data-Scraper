    "postText": "I work part-time and go to school full time. I was at SBVC from 2018 to 2020 and have been here at CSUSB ever since. I am taking 5 classes and trying to withdraw from 2 of them because I cannot do it anymore. I am planning on taking a semester off to blow some steam or I might get expelled.\n\nMy question is if its bad to drop 2 classes and get 2 Ws. I'd rather get 2 Ws than hurt my GPA. I don't know what to do... Is it possible to drop this semester and take a leave of absence? I've read everything I could on the website but still don't understand it fully.\n\nI have not been put on SAP. But I'm sure that I will be after this semester. I am a supply chain management major and planning on doubling it with an administration concentration: information security. Mostly because I really want to find a job. and supply chain may not be enough. I need about 3 full-time semesters left, but again I'm just burnt out..",

It's good that you recognize it and are taking action rather than continue to burn your self out further. \nIt's okay to take things slow with less classes. I started taking 12 units instead of 15 because I know I couldn't handle it with my two jobs. To help solve these questions you can talk to your advisor and the office of Registrar. If you need help contacting your advisor or the office of Registrar, feel free to dm me",

After I transferred from SBVC to CSUSB, also with a part time job, I got a burnout wall very hard and I think if I would've taken a quarter off, I may never have come back. I know so many people who took time off and ended up dropping out. You know your resilience and motivation more than anyone else though. Best of luck!",

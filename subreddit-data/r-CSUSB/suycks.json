Students aren't the main source of spread, but we still do spread the virus and we closed campus for a reason. The cases are still really high compared to last year, and I just think it's silly to force everyone on campus. Some of my classrooms don't even have windows lol. They really should be pushing for more hybridization for students that want the option to learn from home. Especially at CSUSB, a large portion of the population lives at home with their aging parents. Its not like UCI where everyone that goes there lives on their own around other young students. Forcing everyone to campus is just going to create problems that don't need to exist when we clearly have the tech to cater to both stay at homes and campus students.",

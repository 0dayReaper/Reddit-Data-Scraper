Thing is, it has been 2 weeks since I have emailed him and a little bit over a week and a half since I put in a formal request. Anyone have any idea what I should try and do next?",

Find the professor's office hours and whether he is scheduled to be there and not elsewhere.  You can set an appointment with an academic advisor or the chairperson of the department to register into the course, which they can do directly to override and restrictions of the normal student registration system.",

I tried going to academic advising and all they told me to do was to put in new request, I went to the Computer Science and Engineering department and asked for a meeting or to set up an appointment, and they said to email the same professor I have been trying to contact for 2 weeks now, and I tried to set up an appointment with the department head and now I'm waiting for a response.",

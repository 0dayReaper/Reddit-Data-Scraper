    "postText": "For anyone interested in obtaining a teaching credential through CSUSB's program, here is my experience :)\n\nI completed **Track A** of the program which is basically set up like this: 5 classes during the first semester with 120 observation hours at a school and 4 classes during the second semester with a student teaching placement. This is the fastest and the most rigorous track. During the second semester, one of the classes is actually your placement at a school with a university supervisor and one is the TPA class that is 100% online. \n\nCSUSB was not very organized with this program but with covid restrictions still being lifted, I understand that things were still pretty spotty with the CTC and school districts. \n\nDuring the **first semester (Spring 2021)** where I was taking 5 classes, I was on campus 3x a week while also accruing 120 hours of early fieldwork at a school district local to me. Every class starts after 4:00 pm and they run as late as 9:45 pm. Some classes are hybrid but it honestly just depends on what the program coordinators decide for that term. They were not very clear about the format that this program would be delivered in and there was often confusion among students and faculty. I worked some evenings because it was absolutely impossible for me to survive without working. The first semester was hectic but it flew by! The professors that I had kept the courseload light because they understand just how hard it is to have to do so much! This semester definitely kept me super busy but I felt that it was doable.   \n\n\nMy **second semester (Fall 2022)** was complete chaos! This is where you complete both cycles of TPA's in a span of 16 weeks while student teaching. I feel like the program lacks in the area of preparing us for TPA's because they don't really explain any of it until the semester that you have to complete them. I was lucky in that I spent the summer reading the rubrics for both cycles because that is ultimately why and how I passed. They do not do enough to prepare you for TPA's. TPA's ARE HUGE! You cannot become a credentialled teacher without passing both cycles!! As I previously mentioned I spent the entire summer reading the rubrics for both cycles. If you have time, try to spend a few days prior to the start of your student teaching reading the rubrics for TPA's. The TPA professors that I had was so wonderful! He read every single template that I completed and he watched and approved every video before I submitted it but, there just isn't enough time in one semester to prepare for and meet the demands of TPA's. I also feel like the program didn't actually teach me how to teach. Student teaching is supposed to help with that and it certainly did but I feel like I just acquired a bunch of ideas on what activities I can facilitate in the classroom as opposed to how to deliver instruction while effectively assessing my students. I guess this will come with experience over the years. \n\nI am officially finished with the program and I am now preparing for my M.A in secondary education while I apply for teaching jobs this semester. This program was a complete rollercoaster. I laughed, I cried, I DID IT! If I can do it so can you! If you have any questions please feel free to reach out!! Good luck!",

            "comment": "Thank you for sharing. I\u2019m still working on my degree and am planning to teach. Still haven\u2019t decided if I want to do multiple subject or single. I\u2019m an English major with a concentration in linguistics. Why did you decide to go with single subject? I know some people don\u2019t like to work with younger kids but I do and that\u2019s why I decided this is what I want to do. However, I\u2019m a mom of three and I worry about the schedule of the program since I\u2019m the one to take my kids to and from school. It\u2019s a problem because my husband and I don\u2019t have any help. Did you have any \u201colder\u201d people in your classes? Also, have you ever subbed?",

                    "comment": "I decided to go with single subject because after years of working as an aid at an elementary school I could not handle it anymore lol. In my personal opinion, I noticed that it was a lot of work having to lesson plan for multiple subjects as opposed to writing one lesson plan for my favorite subject and teaching it all day. The behaviors at the lower level were getting worse and since they\u2019re younger there is no accountability and you have to deal with problematic behaviors all day as opposed to only 55 minutes a day at the secondary level. I did love all of the kids though! I was just super burnt out and not passionate about the other subjects the way I am with English. I prefer the older children because I enjoy the topics we can discuss in class because they are more mature. \n\nThere were plenty of people in their late 30\u2019s and early 40\u2019s in the program. Some were even in their 50\u2019s. :) CSUSB offers multiple track options. Track A is 2 semesters, and Track B is 3 semesters. You may be able to align your schedule with your children\u2019s if you are placed at a school in their district for observation hours or student teaching. \n\nI have subbed before and from my experience, highschool is my favorite! :) Currently, I am on a long term assignment at a middle school.",

Im interested in the program but I want to know how manageable the schedule is. \n\nAlso how expensive was the program? \n\nWhen you said that you worked some evenings because you had to in order to survive, it reminded me of when I attended an info session for the program last year. The coordinator giving the presentation during the session literally told us that they frowned upon students working during the program because of how rigorous it was and working would sort of a distraction.",

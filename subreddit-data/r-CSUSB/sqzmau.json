    "postText": "My daughter was accepted as a pre-nursing student for Fall 2022. I read that the generic BSN program is offered at San Bernardino Campus and at the Palm Desert Campus. Is there a difference aside from location? Is there housing offered at both locations? Her acceptance letter did not specify which campus. Thanks!",

Aside from location, there isn\u2019t a difference between the programs - same curriculum and requirements. \n\nShe should know if she applied to the San Bernardino (\u201cmain\u201d) campus or Palm Desert Campus, as she would have had to indicate that on her Cal State Apply application. If she\u2019s unsure, she can contact Admissions to verify! Congrats to her!",

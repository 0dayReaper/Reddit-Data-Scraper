    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have been going through the classes for Upper-Division GE Arts &amp; Humanities that are also writing intensive so that I can check off two required things at once. I have been looking at a few that seem interesting, but I thought I would ask if anyone has taken any of these courses and what you thought of the class. I am planning this course for the spring.  Can anyone help?\n\nPHIL3006 Philosophy in Children's Literature\n\nPHIL3007 Philosophy in Young Adult Literature\n\nPHIL3010 Truth, Lies, and Bullshit\n\nWLL3920 Great Works, Revolutionary Ideas, and Important Discoveries",

All they do is endlessly circle the lot looking in vain for an open spot, since it's always full of ghost cars.  On nights with a full moon, you may hear the yipping of werecoyotes in the distance.",

It was always scarily quiet and I lived next to Tokay (a dorm that hasn\u2019t been in use since like 2018) and I could see into it and it always seemed like it was haunted",

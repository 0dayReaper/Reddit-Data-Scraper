I would much rather teach my children to have compassion for their fellow human beings no matter their race/gender/sexual orientation than to teach them right wing harmful ideologies. Why is it that some states are trying to ban history books? Why is it that some states are controlling women\u2019s bodies? Why are some states trying to raise the voting age? Because they know what is coming, they are a dying breed. Why are some congressmen/women saying that gun violence is due to mental illness but then oppose mental health treatment in schools? Probably to keep the multiple centuries long love affair of white supremacy alive in this country. Those are the same people who (like you) vomit misogyny and bigotry from their mouth. The same people who want to oppress the marginalized communities. The same people who keep slavery alive today via mass incarceration. I can go on and on\u2026.\n\nSo they should be very afraid because more and more the younger generations are not falling for their lies. The only people falling for it are the same ones who fall for cult like ideologies.",

These kids struggle with the feelings they have inside. They don\u2019t transition for fun, it is very hard for them. If we can prevent children from suicidal tendencies and gun violence because they are ashamed of who they are, then we should.",

If it makes them happy to be who they really want to be, then what right do you have to tell them what they can or cannot be? That\u2019s like people telling me that I am a race trader because I am white and my husband is Mexican, I don\u2019t give two fucks about what anybody says because I\u2019m happy and it\u2019s my life and nobody has the right to tell me what I can and cannot do. How do you have any right to dictate someone else\u2019s life? You can think that it\u2019s wrong and immoral but so what? Nobody gives a shit, especially those who you are trying to tell not to do what makes them happy.",

    "postText": "Are we ever gonna do something about being used as $6000 pawns by Chancellor Reed who is instead of restructuring how we finance the CSU's operation, actually using our 9 percent hike to quiet the CFA. The CFA/fcaulty that says they are for students, yet they help push the tuition higher due to their greedy demands. Families and graduates are struggling to sustain any job whatsoever yet the union wants more when the state simply cannot give it. \nDemand that the legislature do something to fix the funding to CSUs, demand the pay cuts of presidents and highest offices of the CFA. \nAre you pissed yet? Stop letting them use us. I think we should boycott the tuition increase and simply do not pay it. Every student to not pay it.",

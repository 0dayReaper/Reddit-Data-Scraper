    "postText": "**Stay Away!**\n\nHey everyone, just wanted to shed some light on The Glen's current actions since they are constantly advertising their apartment complex on campus. The best they can do for us is wave the transaction fee for online payment, which is $2.95. They clearly do not care about our financial situations as college students, and I would never reccomend moving there.\n\nAlso, completely unrelated to the current situation, did you know that there have been 27 burglaries at The Glen since September? This includes car theft and actual apartment break-ins. The best they could do for us was install a chain lock on our back door, even though the person came through the window \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnyways, I urge you all to not sign a lease with them, anywhere is better than The Glen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/acyq4216wvp41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=525d20499ef40f7b3434872dc9ca1b2851cb0c74",

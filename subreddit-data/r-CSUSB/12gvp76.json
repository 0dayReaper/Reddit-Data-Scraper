    "postText": "I'm trying to decide which school to go. I want to major in psychology. (Pysch science with a minor in education if I go to UCI, but idk how the pysch department is). Im not going to receive much financial help from my parents, but I worked so hard and believe I can make it work despite the cost of uni. I'm planning to join air force ROTC as well during my time at university. Csusb is less expensive, but i love the location of uci. I just need to pick between these schools.",

            "comment": "Psych is a very impacted major here at CSUSB so you will initially be accepted as a Pre-Psychology major. Once you meet the prereqs you will be accepted as a psych major. It\u2019s probably the cheapest tuition of the UCs and CSUs. San Bernardino isn\u2019t the best city but the surrounding areas like Fontana, Rialto and Ontario are really nice and less expensive than Irvine. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in minoring in education because you want to become a teacher or work at a school in some capacity CSUSB would be the better choice. CSUSB has a lot of great resources for aspiring educators",

            "comment": "what\u2019s your goal with the psychology degree? If you are hoping to do something research related or a career path that requires a PhD, then UCI would be the school for you since UCs have strong research opportunities. If you are hoping to do something more practical (school psychology, counselor) then go to csusb. If money is an issue, you can always take the community college route then transfer to either. That was the one thing I regretted in my undergraduate program, not going to cc",

            "comment": "I'm sure UCI is a beautiful campus. CSUSB has mountains as a backdrop and it's not bad despite the location. You will get an education. I highly suggest going to the Psych department websites and looking through the faculty and seeing what their research interests are (if you have an interest in research). I know that there are SO many students in the Psych department so you can become a lost face at either school. You have to go out of your way to get to know the professors. Also, go to both university websites and look at the requirements. I am sure UCI has more stringent requirements. At CSUSB, there are three concentrations (General Psych, Biological Psychology, and industrial/organizational Psych. You can reach your goals regardless of which school you choose.  If you're looking for your degree to have a stronger math/science component, UCI might be a better fit. But if cost matters most, you can reach your goals at either school and CSUSB has a lot of resources for students, especially financially struggling students.",

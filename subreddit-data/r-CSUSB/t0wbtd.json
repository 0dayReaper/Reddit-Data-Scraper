I\u2019m not sure if all students received one but those who did- the full grant got divided into three parts. The amount you receive is based on the units you are taking and how crucial their financial need is. The money does not have to be paid back.",

You can pull now.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\n\n*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",

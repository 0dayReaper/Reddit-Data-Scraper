My MBA was about $6k total. \n\nI\u2019m making 240k/yr. I\u2019m not special, highly intelligent, or charismatic. It\u2019s really about staying educated and developing yourself throughout your career. This is what keeps you marketable. \n\nCSUSB had access to newer technology at the time (computer labs were well supplied) and we had to present in almost every upper division class. IMO, speaking well publicly is very important to succeed. \n\nMy husband got his BS from UCR. His salary has not exceeded mine. I am, however, more motivated by $ than he is. He\u2019s probably the smarter of the two of us because he is retired, and I am still working. \ud83d\ude09\n\nAll that said, go to a school that will engage you enough to stay motivated to finish. That\u2019s what really matters.",

I'm pretty involved and I see students who got their undergrad there. It doesn't seem like they are getting top notch students. I know it's not an ivy league school but Jesus. Not to be mean but some students can barely do simple tasks.",

Can\u2019t speak on the program, only business classes I took at UCR were intro, but the school is great. Enjoyed my time there but it really depends on what you make of it. Both schools are commuter schools, so you have to work harder to network. They both offer good amounts of aid and it\u2019s demographics are similar enough. UCR probably has better professors on paper, but that\u2019s always subjective to your own experience with them. Biggest difference is probably research opportunities, you\u2019ll find more of that at a UC. If you care to do research. Also, they probably offer more job/internships opportunities as well but you also face a stronger level of competition.",

You will be required to do many things for many reasons in any order needed to fulfill them to make progress and not miss any deadlines.\n\nDon't expect anyone to guide you by the hand through the process.  You need to be actively searching for all information that's already been published online for students.   Nearly every question that students normally ask can be answered by information on the university website, so that's why you should seek this information first so that you don't become bothersome by asking things you should've already read online.",

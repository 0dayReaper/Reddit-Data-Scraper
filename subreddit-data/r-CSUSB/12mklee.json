They\u2019ll even walk you from class to your car/dorm if you want. \n\nThe city of San Bernardino itself is known for being dangerous but honestly it\u2019s not that bad. Literally just be aware of your surroundings and don\u2019t be out in bad areas at night. \n\nIf you are worried about it I\u2019d suggest going more to cities that surround San Bernardino. Redlands is a very nice city a little farther down from San Bernardino and other cities like Fontana, Rialto, Ontario and Rancho Cucamonga are pretty safe.",

Those criminals are largely killing men at higher rates than women, so while women are getting victimized, they're demonstrably at a lower risk and rate even when they take safety precautions. Why? Because criminals tend to have social rules about harming women. Gangs for instance are more [likely ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/heinous-and-violent-ms-13s-appeal-to-girls-grows-as-gang-becomes-americanized/2018/05/04/a4132e94-40bf-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html)to recruit them than harm them.\n\nYou're just acting in bad faith and giving an emotional response to someone trying to provide something useful (data) instead of misinformation because this feminist university indoctrinates students to oppose civil disagreement and believe in feelings over facts.

Make sure that you have a clean cut plan for graduation so youre not wasting time with an extra semester. The school is a great place to be, but ensure that you choose your professors wisely; there are some great professors at CSUSB in the CSE department, but also some pretty sub par one. For the best help in all this; find out your advisor. Furthermore I recommend contacting Professor Fadi Muheidat, he is a great professor and always had helped me when i needed it most. If you need help finding classes in your first day then you could also PM me.",

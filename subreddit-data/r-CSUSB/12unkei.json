This way, you can determine how much traffic you\u2019re willing to tolerate. So for example, without traffic the drive from LA to campus could be an easy one hour or less. With traffic you\u2019ll be driving for at least three hours. The jams fluctuate depending on general work hours.",

It\u2019s definitely a pain but it\u2019s something you can survive. Maybe you can bunch all your classes on Mondays and Wednesdays or something. My car gets 400 miles at full tank and I spend around $50 bucks to refill. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m stressing you out but I want to be real with you about what to expect.",

    "postText": "Hello I will be a freshman this fall and I was checking my portal and I saw that I had 5 classes enrolled. I haven\u2019t registered for classes or gone to orientation and they had told me that I register for classes at orientation. Is this a normal occurrence? Will they change once I register? I don\u2019t like the classes or the schedule at all so it is a worry for me. Is anyone else in the same situation?",

Just go to ASUA Academic Advising Drop-Ins if you would like help seeing what classes to take, but feel free to take whatever you like when they show you how to change your classes. And you can take up to 18 units without needing permission, and at least 12 units to be considered a full time student. Do what you are comfortable with.",

If you want help finding better ones that work in your schedule, ASUA helps. \n\nAlso, we have a great Student Mentoring Program that can support you with stuff like this and overall adjusting to campus and finding other resources. I've been using it and it's been pretty great. If you get it, see if you can get paired with Simi. He was my mentor and really good.",

Make an appointment before choosing classes to go through your MyCap and choose classes then make another appointment after choosing classes if you end up with any different classes. The second appointment is to make sure those classes are ok and for any questions. Keep in touch with them frequently and bring up any class issues youre having.",

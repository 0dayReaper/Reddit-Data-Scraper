    "postText": "Hello,\nI just got admitted to CSUSB and it seems that the last step for me is my orientation/registration. I don\u2019t get to register for classes until my orientation. I\u2019m a little worried since I will be getting the last pick of the litter. I\u2019m scared my schedule will be scattered and that I won\u2019t have much options for classes. I prefer to do half online and half in person, due to my job. I\u2019m scared to get the worst pick. I also was wondering, what are the least busy days on campus.",

            "comment": "More options open up later on in the registration period as more people fill classes. Luckily, as a transfer, you have many classes to choose from. You should have no problem getting a schedule that it good enough to work with your schedule during your first term in most cases. I wouldn't worry too much, but make sure you get on waitlists sooner than later.",

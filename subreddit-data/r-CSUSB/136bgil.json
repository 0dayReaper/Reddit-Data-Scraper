Expect, at most, as a full time student: 4700k bill to pay upfront until some assistance kicks in. I would still recommend in applying for FASFA as there is only a universal grant called \"state university grant\" that offers 2000k on a first come basis, but there are plenty of scholarships worth looking into. After all, paying for a fraction of the cost is def worth it than getting nothing in return. Then again, FASFA is not a guarantee, so expect for the worst. Importantly, avoid those loans at all cost as their interest rates is really a sham itself. As an alternative, have you look into borrowing from relatives?",

I won\u2019t be able to work full time for a couple years because I have a baby, but I have enough support from my family and partner to finish school in the meantime. I might be able to rely on relatives for some support, but I\u2019m hoping my savings get me through by until then.",

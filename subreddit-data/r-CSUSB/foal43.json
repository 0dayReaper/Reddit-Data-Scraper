Video Cameras in the house - observing and recording your actions\n2. Harassing you to clean her house, demanding pictures every week. She circles in red of 'spots' you missed. Threatens to deduct your deposit if you don't re-clean it.\n3. If you break the lease early, she will demand money for breaking the lease\n4. She visits the house every Saturday in her white van to 'watch her house' thus ruining your peaceful weekend. No 24 hour notice of landlord entry.\n5. Tries to steal as much of your security deposit as possible, deducts deposit for the most ridiculous reasons! By Law, always require an itemized list of your security deposit.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\\*Invasion of Tenant Privacy\\***\n\n**\\*Landlord inability to fix plumbing and toilet in 2nd floor\\***\n\n**\\*Blackmail and Harassment for Security Deposit**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnyone staying in this house, ya'll have the right to sue her. I hope justice and karma comes to her for ripping off CSUSB students. All the Landlady cares about is money and not the well-being of her tenants, bad person to do business with!\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Remember that you can ask for 6 or 12 month leases, do your research before signing the contract\\*\\*\\***\n\n[Where she watches you 24\\/7](https://preview.redd.it/3pl0atooipo41.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a0489bbd38001cf388ed618b40865a0bf714a7f0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[View of her camera watching you.](https://preview.redd.it/j5e31pp1lpo41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=61154e9bb9413f64a15db9d432709273f3b83024)",

Stick to the facts with her.",

Her actions of video taping you 24/7 inside the living room/kitchen was NEVER written on the contract therefore it is illegal. \n\nBoth parties must follow the contract in good faith, when the other party deceives the other - the contract would become voidable and unenforceable. \n\nPlease be careful of the bad people out there guys!",

The landlord there charged her $300 for having a piece of her hair on the floor, like wtf! My friend asked if she can have her security deposit back and only gave her less than half of her security deposit. The landlord even made her clean the WHOLE house before she could even get her deposit back...\n\nThat landlord lady preys on international students that don't know their rights.",

IANAL but California is two-party consent state for recorded conversations where an expectation of privacy is expected.  Especially confidential information.   As others have stated if it's not specifically agreed upon in the contract I don't think she can even have the camera there and there would be no recourse if a tenant blocked the camera.",

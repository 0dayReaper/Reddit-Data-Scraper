    "postText": "Hey everybody, I\u2019m looking to restart the running club at CSUSB, since the current Coyote Running Club is defunct from what I know. I just wanted to gauge the interest of this as I need a couple members before I can undergo the process of restarting it, so either message me or comment below if you\u2019re interested!\n\nI know it\u2019s really hot right now and running outside might be the last thing on your mind but we would be doing our runs either in the morning or evening so it wouldn\u2019t be so bad!\n\n\nEDIT: https://www.facebook.com/groups/3257235814499379/?ref=share \nHere\u2019s the link to a Facebook group I\u2019ve made to organize everything, join if you\u2019re interested!",

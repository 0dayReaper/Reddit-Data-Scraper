    "postText": "Hello all. I am currently enrolled in an online university (paid for by my workplace), in which I am majoring in cybersecurity. \n\nI am debating transferring to CSUSB and finishing my degree here. Online has been perfectly fine - but I am eager to get in a classroom and get hands on, and I would like to be in a classroom with \u201cactual\u201d professors and classmates. I\u2019ve heard so many good things about CSUSB cybersecurity program, so that\u2019s a huge factor too. I also feel CSUSB would be better on an application than my online school. \n\nI am a couple credits away from getting 90 units. Meaning I\u2019ve already completed all my general in addition to some IT and cybersecurity classes.\n\nI was hoping for some advice on this - would the fact that I\u2019ve not taken part of my major at CSUSB hurt me - practically speaking, in the form of class/program continuity. There\u2019s other factors that are less important - cost, my graduation date would be pushed back a bit, as I have to apply before February for enrollment until fall 2023.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

Turns out he went on vacation and did not come back until after classes started. Now I have a debt with them but I will not pay because it was not my fault and I told them I will go to court for that amount. Their incompetence isn't my problem.",

    "postText": "I am coming up on my first semester as a graduate student and was wondering if there are any graduates who would share their experience with receiving financial aid/loans. I am not sure if I will receive the Pell grant as I have used almost 460% of the 600% according to the FASFA website. The only option I see in my financial aid portal is to accept a loan, which I don\u2019t mind as I have a Segal Education award of a little more than 12,000 that I can use to pay back the loan. Would I need to accept their whole loan offer or can I just accept the amount to cover tuition? My total cost for my graduate program is just under 17,000. I would appreciate any advice that graduate students can offer on receiving financial aid, taking out loans, or even using their Segal Education Award.",

The SUG covered the majority of my tuition for the fall and spring- i payed apx. 800 out of pocket if i remember correctly. *my EFC is 0",

My first semester I took 14 units where as now, I am taking 7 units for the upcoming Fall. Guess, what? Tuition is still the same, as confirmed by admin's email:\n\n&gt;CSU San Bernardino charges by units\u2019 range. 0 \u2013 6 units, would cost the student $2,987.22 (Graduate Programs) whether the student is taking one 3-unit class or two 3-unit classes. It\u2019s the same for 6.1 units and plus units (Graduate Programs). Since you are taking 7 units for Fall 2023 semester you are being charged $4,493.22. Hypothetically, let\u2019s say you enrolled in 18 units for Fall 2023, you would still be charged $4,493.22",

However, there is a State University Grant that aims to cover only a portion of your tuition based on a first apply basis. I got 2k per semester as a reimbursement to a nearly 5k per bill as a full time student. If you have some sort of a disability, apply to their DRC  in order to qualify for more scholarships in the future. The scholarship for this year has closed since March though. I personally don't have anything to say in regard to loans, but I never needed them as I had money saved up from undergrad. Luckily, my mother planned ahead of time to set aside some of her money too.",

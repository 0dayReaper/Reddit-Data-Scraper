I turned in everything they asked for in February before the deadline and haven\u2019t heard from the college since. I check my portal and it shows that everything was received and that I don\u2019t need to do anything but like I said I haven\u2019t heard from them since the beginning of February. Should I reach out to admissions or wait it out?",

Some have been getting their answers I think, but we just have to wait it out. What major did you apply for? \n\nBest of luck!!!!!",

    "postText": "This whole program literally screams \u201cdon\u2019t sit with us\u201d unless you have a 4.0 gpa or 85%+ in TEAS. Their requirements say 3.5 overall and minimum 70% in the TEAS but it\u2019s kind of stupid how it\u2019s still not enough you pass the requirements, you have to compete with everybody, so it ends up becoming like that. They\u2019re so proud as if it\u2019s such an amazing thing that they only accept 49 students in the program despite taking in 450 pre-nursing students only to pit them against each other, and leave the other unaccepted students out in the dust. Stop accepting these much pre-nursing students when you only plan to take 10% in. Pre-requisite science classes aren\u2019t really that good either unless you get one out of the two good professors (Dr. Sumida or Dr. Horner, but I think the latter doesn\u2019t teach A&amp;P for Allied Health anymore) who actually know how to teach their class, and you also get to have a single pre-nursing advisor who you barely see; so it\u2019s kind of setting you up for failure. \n\nI know someone who has the said requirements above and got her acceptance delayed because she took her pre-requisites early (because she could!) despite getting a good grade. \n\nThis program only sees you as numbers, that\u2019s all. It doesn\u2019t even matter if you\u2019re a healthcare worker who most likely want to further your career, if you\u2019re an average student and below, then you\u2019re better off somewhere else.\n\nThat\u2019s why make your research guys, if you\u2019re unable to realistically achieve this requirement for some reason then don\u2019t waste your time here like I did.",

            "comment": "https://www.rn.ca.gov/education/passrates.shtml\n\nWhich school has the highest number of students passing the NCLEX every year?   I'll give you a hint: they had 2,132 students pass last year.\n\nWhich CSU program has the highest number of students passing NCLEX?  CSU San Marcos.   How many?  150-200.   That's about 10% of the #1 school.\n\nIf you think CSUSB is bad, you haven't really looked at many other programs that are far worse.   The UCLA nursing program has about 100 times more applicants than CSUSB, and they accept only 25-50 students a year.\n\nIt's a matter of economics, supply and demand.  A lot more students want to get into a nursing program than there are seats and instruction available at public expense.  The tuition paid at any UC, CSU, or community college doesn't even cover half of the cost of running the programs.  The programs couldn't exist without state funding from tax money.   So you'll always get a situation in which student demand exceeds classroom availability, and the easiest way to limit enrollment is to increase admissions standards and make students compete for the spots.\n\nThey don't need you.  You need them a lot more than they need you.  They can always find other students to fill the seats when they reject you.  They will have a line of students around the block waiting to apply if they wanted to.\n\nIf you didn't qualify, then you didn't do as well as the ones who got accepted.    Rejecting applicants based on GPA and test scores isn't elitist.  It's the opposite.  It's egalitarian.  The ones demonstrating the highest merit are the winners, not the ones who pay the most or who have the most wealth.   That's meritocracy.\n\nBut that's for the publicly subsidized programs.\n\nThe #1 school for nursing is a private university.  That's not a coincidence.   If you can't get into a public subsidized program, you can pay to get into a private one.   The cost for the private BSN is $148,215.   But you probably won't have to pay most of that expense if you have transfer credit that you earned at CSUSB at a much lower cost per unit.\n\nIn other words, your CSUSB credits may not be a waste of time or effort at all.  You'll need to find a program that will accept your completed coursework for transfer.\n\nYou very likely will be able to complete a program somewhere if you keep at it.   Use the discouragement as motivation to step up your efforts.  I suggest you see if you can get into CSU San Marcos that has a higher total number of graduates passing NCLEX.",

There are other medical specialties that are in high demand that many students don't consider at all, like Respiratory Therapy and related technical careers such as biomed tech to repair ventilators.  Nobody could have predicted the massive increase in demand for these specialties in the last several years due to the effects of covid19 that targets the lungs of patients.\n\nI've had a chance to observe the roles of healthcare workers in ICU and telemetrics.  Respiratory therapists seem to have a lot easier job than the nurses.   Maybe there are some related career paths that might appeal to you too.",

    "postText": " TLDR: You will still need to wear a face covering when on campus regardless of vaccination. \n\nYesterday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced updated guidance for vaccinated individuals on face covering requirements as a health and safety mitigation to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\u00a0 The campus community is advised that the California Department of Public Health has not yet made any adjustments to the state-wide face covering mandate.\u00a0 As such, the current CSUSB Face Covering Policy remains unchanged and is still in effect.\u00a0 CSUSB will continue to monitor any changes on state and county face covering guidance and make announcements as they are received.\n\n**CSUSB Face Covering Policy**\n\nAll campus community members, including those who are fully vaccinated, are required to continuously wear a face covering over their nose and mouth when they enter any indoor campus facility.\u00a0 This includes all lobbies, hallways, bathrooms, break rooms, and any open office space with multiple workstations, even if there are no other individuals present. Face coverings are also required outside when physical distance of six feet or more cannot be maintained.\u00a0 Also, face coverings are required in vehicles on campus when there is more than one person in the vehicle.\u00a0 For those working indoors and alone in an enclosed office, the face covering may be removed if the office door is closed completely.\n\n**Face Coverings Exceptions**:\u00a0 Some individuals may be exempt from wearing a face covering under certain circumstances, such as those with a medical (including mental health) condition, or disability that prevents wearing a face covering, and persons who are hearing impaired, or communicating with a person who is hearing impaired, where the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication.\u00a0 Employees seeking an exemption for wearing a face covering should contact the Human Resources Office at 909/537-5138.\u00a0 Students seeking an exemption should contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 909/537-5238.\u00a0\n\nWhile everyone is encouraged to bring a personal face covering to the campus, they will be provided upon request at the Parking Information Kiosk at University Parkway.\u00a0\n\nDue to the fluid nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, CSUSB health and safety requirements are subject to change.\u00a0 It is important for the campus community to stay connected to the latest campus information through the [csusb.edu/covid-19](https://csusb.edu/covid-19) website.\n\n*This message from* [*COVID-19@CSUSB.EDU*](mailto:COVID-19@CSUSB.EDU) *serves as the official notification to the university campus community.*",

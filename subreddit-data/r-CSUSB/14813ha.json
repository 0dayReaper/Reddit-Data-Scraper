    "postText": "I start my MSA program in the fall.  I have filled out my FAFSA but on my financial aid page, it says nothing, no loans, no financial aid.  I need to know if I need to get loans myself.  Do Master programs have grants? I haven't been able to get ahold of anyone at the financial aid office.  Has anyone been in this situation?  Any advise?",

You may have to personally go to the financial aid office to see the status of your award letter.  I don't know the schedule for the letters.  The award letter shows all of the grants, scholarships, and work-study that have been given to you.",

Next, wait for it to be processed, reviewed, and approved. Then, check your financial aid tab in coyote. Then, accept or edit how much of a loan you want to take. I know you probably need more details on the second half, but start with applying for a loan and then feel free to come back to this thread and I\u2019ll do my best to help you further.",

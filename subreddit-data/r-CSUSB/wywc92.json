    "postText": "Hello. I am a 3rd year math major and I have enrolled for the Fall 2022 semester. I was going over the classes I am enrolled in currently and noticed that my paws report suggested differently from the website listing all the course requirements for my major. In my case, my paws report suggest I do not have to take a certain class, but the website listing all the courses does suggest taking that class. Which one is right? I have made an appointment to talk to an advisor already, but I was hoping someone here knows so that I can drop unnecessary classes. Thank you in advance.",

            "comment": "faculty advisor here. you should do all of the above, but you need to understand what each of things are and what they tell you.\n\nPAWS: this is actually a tool used by the Office of the Registrar and is not truly designed for student use. It tells you what requirements you need to fulfill to graduate but it doesn't tell you ANYTHING about why you need to take those things and in what ORDER you should be taking them in.\n\n[CSUSB Course Catalog](https://catalog.csusb.edu): this tells you the organization of your degree program (in other words, what is the REASON your program is designed in the way it is, including the GE portion of your degree). The Course Catalog also tells you course descriptions (what is the content of this course) and any pre-requisites for those courses. This tells you what the course is and why the course is, and it also tells you what order you should be taking classes in. But it doesn't tell you WHEN courses are offered. \n\n[CSUSB Schedule of Classes](https://www.csusb.edu/class-schedule): Many students try to look for classes via your student center search, but the problem with that approach is that you can only find classes if you know exactly what you are looking for. If you want to browse courses that are offered, this is a much more useful way to search. Schedules are usually released well in advance of registration for the next term, AND you can also search past years to look at offering patterns.\n\nFinally, you should be going to advisors (either [ASUA advisors](https://www.csusb.edu/academic-success-and-undergraduate-advising) or your faculty advisors in your department) for help with this. IN THEORY you can piece together all the information you need from the sources above. But in practice it can be complicated and confusing, and there are subtleties in things that are not obvious with the published information.",

The course catalog says I need to take an additional class outside of my major, but the PAWS report doesn\u2019t say anything about that extra class. I\u2019m not sure if the course catalog is outdated as the Paws report is for the fall 2022 semester.",

    "postText": "Hello, I got accepted into CSUSB for the fall as a transfer student from Chaffey. My selected major says pre-social work instead of just Social work. I\u2019m confused if those tittles make a difference in classes I should take. Also, according to some videos I watched we don\u2019t/can\u2019t register for classes until after orientation in July. Any advice on where I can reach  out for help bc they keep repeating that all answers will be answered at orientation but I don\u2019t want to wait that long if possible. Should I just drive to campus and try to speak with someone?",

It\u2019s the school\u2019s process to wait until after orientation to help you register. They want to help you for your first round, tell you where all the resources are, and explain what their graduation requirements are for the major.\n\nFurther more, the \u201cpre\u201d title will be removed once you\u2019ve met the prerequisites to be considered in the social worker major. Right now, you are in the program. You just need to take some prerequisite courses before you start taking the major requirements. They will explain this more I\u2019m depth at your orientation.",

Did you receive a separate email from the school of social work? \n\nJust to be sure you submitted the separate application to the social work program correct? \n\nIf not, you should be receiving a separate email from Maria Roa or Nick Watson about whether or not you were admitted to the program. Once you are officially in the social work program your major will change from pre-social work to social work. \n\nAlso you can\u2019t register for classes until after your orientation. You don\u2019t have to worry about your social work classes because those have spots designated for you. However, your capstone classes are the ones you need to ensure you get ASAP. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to PM me. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAlso congrats on getting into CSUSB!",

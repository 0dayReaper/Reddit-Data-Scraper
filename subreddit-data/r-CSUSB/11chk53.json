    "postText": "I am curious what the NSS MA program is like. I am about to get my BA in Political Science and I have a few professors actively encouraging me to attend CSUSB's NSS program, but I haven't really been able to find a lot about it outside of the program website and what my professors and CSUSB's professors have told me. If anyone in the program or has graduated from the program sees this, please comment. I would love to hear your opinion and view of the program.",

I got Wednesdays, so i got Friday until Monday off. second semester got a bit better gap wise. the more seniority you have, the better gap times become. clinicals are going to be around the Fontana and Colton area. my first semester clinical spot was at kaiser in fontana. it would be around a half hour drive in the morning from campus.\n\nfrom my dorming experience, i loved how i could just wake up at a later time and not feel rushed during clinical days or class days. i do feel it is beneficial to live closer aka on campus if you live more than 40+ minutes away. however, if you can\u2019t afford it, the commute within the county is not toooo unbearable since ive seen some people do it 4 semesters straight.",

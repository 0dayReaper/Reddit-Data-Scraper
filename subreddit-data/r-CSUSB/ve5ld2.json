    "postText": "Hello CSUSB Reddit!\n\nI am a Recruitment Coordinator for COPE Health Scholars at Kaiser Permanente Riverside and I wanted to let all of you know about our program! If you have never heard of COPE, it is a clinical volunteering program where students gain firsthand experience in both clinical and administrative health care settings and become an integral part of the care delivery team. They will work right alongside doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals in caring for patients and helping to run hospital floors. COPE is the best way to accumulate clinical hours and gain valuable experience while doing so. Additionally, students will be awarded a certificate from the Keck Graduate Institute upon completing 280 hours within the program! I have attached our flier for more information, as well. If you are interested in joining our team, please check out [https://copehealthscholars.org/programs/health-scholar/overview/](https://copehealthscholars.org/programs/health-scholar/overview/) or send me an email at kprrc3@copehealthscholars.org. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2k8y9jn7a4691.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1f2e77b5f53f4c65d0a6f2d18c52e20d3d45d8fb",

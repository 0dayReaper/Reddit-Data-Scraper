If the homework includes stuff like online labs, online textbook assignments or stuff like that, odds are itll be an online class.\n\nChild development, personally, sounds like most of it would be in person, but I honestly don't have a clue.",

Depending on who the professor is they sometimes offer zoom if you can\u2019t make it to class or they sometimes post recordings of the lecture. Most of my hw is posted on canvas, overall it just depends on the professor. Lmk if you have any questions tho!\ud83d\ude0a",

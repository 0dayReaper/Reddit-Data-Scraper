    "postText": "Hey everyone, there\u2019s like 3 weeks left until admissions deposits or whatever they\u2019re called are due, and I\u2019m pretty stressed. I still can\u2019t decide what school I want to commit to. I\u2019m going to visit both schools next week so maybe that will give me a better idea.It\u2019s between CSUSB and Northern Arizona University. \nBoth schools offer AFROTC, which is important since I am set on entering the program. CSUSB has my ideal major which is cybersecurity, but NAU doesn\u2019t, and they didn\u2019t even offer me into my first option there (mechanical engineering) because of a mix up with my app (I got admitted for Bio). But on the other hand NAU has a marching band and drumline I can join unlike CSUSB which only has concert ensembles. \nI\u2019m kind of stuck on what to do, and so I\u2019m just reaching out looking for some things that would draw me more towards CSUSB, and maybe hear about some things that drew you guys to the school. Thanks.",

            "comment": "CSUSB is a great school, and has a very good cyber security program. However, it is largely a commuter school. In my four years here I\u2019ve noticed that campus is dead silent after 5-6ish. Things have started to change a bit because we just got a new student union, and I\u2019m hoping it gets better next academic year in terms of food options (we have the main cafeteria, and the Habit which closes at 3) the actual city of San Bernardino isn\u2019t the best either and is dangerous in certain parts but the surrounding cities (Fontana, Rancho Cucamonga and Ontario) are very nice. There a lot of good things tho. CSUSB is the most inexpensive school out of the Cal States and I felt as if my professors were more reachable because it isn\u2019t such a big school. It\u2019s an improving campus and I feel like it\u2019ll get better with time",

Faculty &amp; staff are very helpful! It\u2019s very diverse, and you never feel out place. There\u2019s always events going on whenever I come to campus so that\u2019s a plus. Parking could be hectic if you don\u2019t come early enough. As for professors, it depends! I usually use rate my professor lol. there\u2019s a lot of food options on campus as well. I\u2019m not sure if I missed anything. overall it isn\u2019t the best csu compared to most, but it\u2019s definitely affordable!",

Sam bernardino does suck so u would avoid that area. Student quality sucks as well. Group projects are horrible and some students are really behind and it'll make you question the program.",

            "comment": "As someone previously said the school seems like it is on the come up, they just put a new building in which is beautiful and there is a lot of fun things to do like the bowling alley, pool tables, they have a very nice gym for the students and many other programs, but yes it is a commuter school and it shows when you walk around and try to smile or wave at people. They often are in their own bubble doing their own thing, I gave a fellow class of 2022 a \u201cwoot woot go class of 2022\u201d and she just stared at me. But all in all you have to do what\u2019s best for you, if this school has the better program that you want to pursue a career In then do it, I wouldn\u2019t pick a marching band hobby over your career. I have also been lucky enough to not acquire any debt from going here and I am very thankful for fafsa, the largest class I have had here was maybe 15 students in a classroom so you can get to know the faculty very well.",

I also am so excited to have close to no debt. Thank you for affirming where my head is at with this school. Seems perfect for my needs.",

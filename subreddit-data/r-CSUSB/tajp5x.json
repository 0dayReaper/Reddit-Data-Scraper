    "postText": "Hey everybody! This is a long shot but I need assistance and to be honest I don't know where to look. I'm a first gen student who is majoring in English at a community college, and after doing\nsome career research I found out about SLPAs (Speech Language Pathology Assistants).\n\nWhen I transfer to a cal state next year I will probably go for a communications disorders major, but I was wondering if anyone has taken a similar\npath to mine? (Of being an English major and switching it to the latter).\n\nAny personal stories or advice is appreciated! Thanks :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm currently enrolled in the teaching credential program and I've had a hard time getting in touch with faculty about some basic questions. I feel like nothing is being explained as thoroughly as it needs to be and my time matters just as much as theirs. ESPECIALLY since everything is time-sensitive with this program. The program coordinators have scheduled orientations via Zoom to go over some power points that are supposed to address questions but they cut most people off when they ask questions and do not respond to the full question. I've never encountered faculty that appear to get upset at questions from students.\n\nI understand that covid has had a major impact on various different aspects of education but I don't think this is ok that been reaching out since December 2021 and we are about to go into February 2022...... and I STILL have yet to hear back. Is this normal for CSUSB? I graduated from the University of La Verne and I have also attended various community colleges. I've never encountered any issues with faculty not responding to me for almost two months lol. I've followed up various times and I've been very polite in my emails. Is there anyone that handles complaints about this type of issue or is this pretty typical for CSUSB? Thank you for your insight! I'm just so lost and confused and would like to know if anyone else has had any similar issues.",

            "comment": "Hello fellow credential program sufferer! I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about. I made the decision to withdraw from the program yesterday, partly because I\u2019m not interested in being a teacher anymore and partly because the program was so horrible I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, but I did want to say that no, this is definitely NOT normal. Take it from someone who went to 4 (!) colleges before CSUSB - community college, public, private, in-state, out of state. I\u2019ve run the gamut and I\u2019ve never seen a program as horribly run as the CSUSB credential one is. They communicate poorly, never accept accountability for their own fuck ups, and, to be frank, the folks they picked to run the SS credential program are incompetent. It\u2019s a clown show. I have no idea how the college of ed lets it run like this.\n\nGood luck going forward! I hope they turn it around for your sake and other folks\u2019. I\u2019ve met so many phenomenal folks in the credential program and they all deserve so much better.",

I've seriously felt so lost throughout the process of being admitted into the program and now that I'm in, I feel even worse. Initially, I was going to complete my MA directly after this program but I think I'm just going to go ahead and transfer back to ULV after I obtain my credential. So far, my professors are great! However, this issue with student services has caused me so much anxiety this semester. If you don't mind me asking, how much of the program did you complete and what was your content area?",

The further along I got, the more I realized I didn\u2019t really want to teach. It just isn\u2019t a career that will fulfill me, unfortunately. I do agree about the professors though! So many of them have been wonderful.",

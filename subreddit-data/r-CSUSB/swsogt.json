This is the first college that has accepted me since last year I got rejected to all of the nursing schools I applied to. Can anyone help me understand the process on how to get into the BSN Program at CSUSB? Is it guaranteed? I have finished all my prerequisites and got A's on all of them expect Anatomy in which I got a B and I got a 76.7% on my TEAS exam.",

Today I got an acceptance email from kinesinfo@csusb.edu\n\nI'm not interested in kinesiology, it's not my field.\n\nI would assume scam, but it has a .edu email address. Anyone know if this is really an address for the department? This kind of mix up happen to anyone else?",

Evidently the email went to 200,000 people instead of just the accepted students that were supposed to receive it( essentially the email of everyone the college office has including faculty and staff) The poor chair of kinesiology chair has been dealing with this person\u2019s screw up in the form of angry emails all day.",

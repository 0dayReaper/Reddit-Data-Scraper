Today I just received an email saying that I got excepted for an exchange program to CSUSB , I thought I would hit up the San Bernardino Reddit before I made my final decision. \n\nI will be studying business and taking business classes well at San Bernardino, and was wondering how students at CSUSB feel about classes, professors, on campus housing and give me some general tips before I make my final choice to move.",

One of those schools where you don\u2019t go home right after class. I literally spent 90% of my time on campus all 4 years! Tons of things to do especially if you make some life long friends! The social life on campus was amazing. Pretty much went home to sleep and was ready to head back the next day even if I didn\u2019t have any classes. The party scene is decent unless you\u2019re a stick in the mud. Just make sure it doesn\u2019t get in the way of your study time! School always comes first.\n\nThe location is also decent. People give it a ton of hate, but they\u2019re just Fear mongering or being a snob. I had tons of foreign exchange buddies from all different socioeconomic backgrounds and they really enjoyed their time! CSUSB has a little bit of fun for everyone, but it\u2019s up to you to find it.",

How about San Diego State?\n\nCSUSB won't give you anything that you can't get just as well at CSUSM.  CSU San Marcos student housing and the location is much better.  The campus is a lot newer and has a lot more to do nearby.  It now has a train stop for the light-rail system that connects to Oceanside and then to downtown San Diego in a reasonable amount of time and convenience.    The Sprinter train runs about every 30 minutes and will take you to the beach in Oceanside in less than an hour.  You can get discounted public transit passes for less than $2/day as a student.   It costs a lot more for driving at $5/gallon and $643 per year for student parking permit, unless you ride a motorcycle or scooter.\n\nSan Bernardino....doesn't have good public transit to connect to San Diego.   \n\nFor example, CSUSB is about 120 miles to downtown San Diego, while CSUSM is 35 miles.   CSUSM also has much better public transportation in San Diego County.\n\nCSUSB does have a good business school.  So does CSUSM.  San Diego State is a top tier business program among all Cal State universities. \n\nAnd just a minor grammar/spelling problem to recognize:  you got \"accepted\" into the program, not \"excepted\".  Not the same thing.  Don't want you to get marked down on any college paper by making that mistake.",

You are probably referring to an ***exchange*** program for international students from another country, right?\n\nA transfer program is normally for a student in USA who completes lower division courses (the first 2 years, freshman+sophomore) at a regionally accredited community college or university for finishing a degree by awarded by another 4 year university.\n\nInternational exchange programs are usually quite a bit different than transfer programs because the students are working on a degree that will be granted and funded by the university in their home country.   Every student in the program is matched to another student from another country, so that it all \"evens out\".\n\nTo avoid confusion when discussing your situation with others, you will probably be an \"international exchange student\" not a \"transfer student\", even though you'll be temporarily \"transferring\" yourself to study at CSUSB.\n\nYou may be able to arrange your schedule to only be on campus for Mondays and Wednesdays, or Tuesdays and Thursdays.  It somewhat depends on exactly where in San Diego your girlfriend lives, because it's a huge region.  It's a completely different situation if she lives in North County, like Rancho Bernardo, Escondido, or San Marcos, compared to South or East County like Chula Vista or La Mesa.  That doubles the travel time, not including rush hours traffic.",

Most students live off campus, drive there, park, go to class, then immediately drive home.  There are students that live on-campus, of course, but don't expect a lot from on-campus social life.  It's all overpriced and not very good, in my opinion.   You probably will have to take whatever they give you without much choice, in any case.   It will be good motivation to do more studying than partying.  If you want an idealized college-life experience, you're gonna have a bad time at CSUSB.  If you want a business degree from an accredited business school, you can get that there.\n\nI suggest going to San Diego and avoiding San Bernardino, as much as possible.  San Bernardino has become one of the worst cities in the USA, and that's not gonna change while you're there, that's for sure.\n\n[San Bernardino ranking](https://www.ocregister.com/2022/10/10/san-bernardino-oakland-los-angeles-rank-most-dangerous-cities-in-state/)\n\nThe CSUSB campus itself is not nearly as dangerous as the surrounding city areas, but even short distances away from the campus can be very bad.\n\nI view CSUSB as a good choice for local students who already live in much worse locations, so the campus can be a big improvement compared to their current life and provide the stepping stone to move away to work and live in a better place for their future.\n\nIt might be OK for you.  I suggest visiting the campus in-person for several days to get a better idea of what you're getting yourself into.",

I just try to warn students of the reality if they aren't accustomed to this kind of urban city life so they don't get themselves into deep shit.   Since you mention music, CSUSB is building a new performing arts center that is a huge upgrade from the old theater.  If you have any interest in synthesizers, CSUSB has an amazing old-school classic [Buchla modular synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchla_Electronic_Musical_Instruments) that was donated to the music program.\n\nOne advantage of going to a school like CSUSB is that sometimes it's better to become the big fish in a little pond instead of a little fish in the ocean.  There's a better chance to be a person who stands-out based on personal effort and talent when there's much less competition.",

I liked the other analogy of big fish in a little pond rather than little fish in a big ocean, which is definitely what CSUSB can do. \n\nDepending how long you're here for, I'd recommend on-campus housing in either Arrowhead Village or University Village (both apartment-style). That way you're not sucked into an off-campus lease than is longer than you need, and that way your utilities are all roped in already, and you don't have to stress about getting everything set up. I like on-campus housing because you just have to show up, and your accommodations are set up (furniture, utilities). Just pack your stuff, get settled, and you're there!",

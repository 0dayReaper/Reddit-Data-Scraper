Do you feel as though you learn much from the classes or are they lacking?\nAlso I read online they recommend you buy a Macbook, can you get away with a different laptop? \nResponses would be appreciated \ud83d\ude0c",

There also may be computers available for loan.  Financial aid won't generally pay for expensive gaming gear like high end graphics cards or large display panels unless it's required for the program.  You can also go to the department of the major to ask them about ways to get the stuff you need to be successful without having to pay cash for it.\n\nYou should also ask to see if there are any student assistant jobs that are available for you now or in the future when you're ready.  This is a great way to get to know professors and staff in the department, and it's these connections that can lead to good internships and opportunities while you're in school.",

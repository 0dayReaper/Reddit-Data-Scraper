            "comment": "Sorry for the long reply, but your situation may be a lot more complex than you realize.\n\nI was in a similar situation as you.  My parents made too much to qualify for grants and unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans weren't an option, but they didn't make enough to pay for my college expenses.  I was on my own for expense.   So even though I was admitted as a freshman, I had a 3.8 GPA in the first quarter of freshman year, and I was working, I couldn't afford the full cost of attending.  I had to drop out to work full-time and wait until I was 24 or older when I could qualify as an independent student.  I paid for community college from my own earnings without loans until I was ready to transfer.  This took a lot longer, but I eventually got it done.\n\nIn direct answer to your question, no, it's not too late to apply for loans for Fall 2023.  However, you may not qualify for enough in loans to cover your tuition and fees, much less your living expenses.  That's because there are maximum limits in loans based on your year of study (freshman, sophomore, junior and above), your parent's income, their ability to qualify for a Parents Plus loan, and your dependency status for the purposes of financial aid.   The dependency rules are rather extensive and complex, but basically, if you're under 24 years old, you're likely going to be considered as a dependent student unless you're married, have a child, are in the military, or have been legally declared as an emancipated minor.  Most students under 24 years old must supply their parents financial information, but sometimes this isn't possible to do if they can't or won't do so.  They can't be forced to cooperate.\n\nThis is crazy and stupid, but that's the way it is.  Students under 24 can be prevented from getting enough financial aid due to their parents.\n\nThere are several types of student loans:  Federal Stafford Direct Subsidized Loans, Federal Stafford Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Unsubsidized Loans, and private loans.\n\nSubsidized loans require a higher financial need qualification (a lower Expected Family Contribution-EFC) because the government pays the interest while you're in school, and they have their own maximum limits even when you do qualify.\n\nIf your parents do qualify for a Parents PLUS loan, then you'll qualify for a lot less of direct unsubsidized loans.\n\nThe following link shows all the max federal loan limits:\n\n[Loan Limits](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized)\n\nSince you seem to be a junior transfer student, the maximum you can get in direct unsubsidized loans may be only $7,500/year if your parents qualify for a PLUS loan, or $12,500/year if they don't or you're an independent student.  You can't get that $12.5K if your parents don't provide their financial info or don't apply/sign.\n\nHere's the [estimated cost of attendance](https://www.csusb.edu/sites/default/files/23-24%20Undergraduate_1.pdf) for an undergraduate California resident.\n\nThe tuition fees alone are $7,536 and the estimated books/supplies are $788.  \n\nDepending on your housing options, the total estimated cost of attendance ranges from $20,700 to $31,716.   This is important because these costs are also the maximum that parents can borrow per year if they qualify for a PLUS loan.  If they don't qualify because they earn too much or if they have a bad credit history, then you might not get any loans from this source.\n\nAt this point, you need to update your FAFSA information for the 2023-2024 year.  I highly recommend that you also choose the option that you are willing to do work-study, because this is additional financial aid that you may need.  Work-study jobs are usually much better than local jobs for the following reasons.\n\n\"A school must make FWS jobs reasonably available to all eligible students at the school. To the maximum extent practicable, a school must provide FWS jobs that complement and reinforce each recipient\u2019s educational program or career goals.\"\n\n\"In assigning an FWS job, a school must consider the student\u2019s financial need, the number of hours per week the student can work, the period of employment, the anticipated wage rate, and the amount of other assistance available to the student. While there is no minimum or maximum award, the amount for each student should be determined based on these factors.\"\n\nRegular off-campus jobs don't have to do any of this.\n\n[Federal Work Study program](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/fsa-handbook/2020-2021/vol6/ch2-federal-work-study-program)\n\nI don't know your specific situation, but you can't get what you don't apply for.  You might as well see what the CSUSB financial aid department awards you in loans and work-study before you make any irreversible decisions or commitments, like signing a housing or rental/leasing contract.   It's not the end of the road if you have to end up working and saving money until you're 24 and can qualify as an independent student.  Obviously that's not probably the preferred path, but it's still a backup plan.   You may be able to start building up experience in some kind of social work or anything related to your future plans, which could make your college work easier and more relevant than without that real-world experience.  Sometimes ya gotta do what's available to you instead of the ideal plan.\n\nI also recommend that you read as much as you can on the links I provided because there's a ton more info that may be important to you.",

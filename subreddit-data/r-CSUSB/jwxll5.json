    "postText": "I have received an admit letter from CSUSB, among other CSU colleges(LA,LB, Fullerton), and from some of my research it seems SB is the one of the best colleges for cybersecurity among CSUs. Being on their website, I've seen various resources they have for cybersecurity, and an active community which participates in cyber competitions.\n\nI went through the course catalogues for my program (MS in CS), however I couldn't find many courses for cyber. Most of the ones I would want to do were present in the IST department, or maybe in lower level courses. I would like to know how is the overall atmosphere for cybersecurity here, and the job prospects after graduation.\n\nThanks for your help!",

            "comment": "As a student in my last term as an undergrad in the B.S. CS program, I can only speak from my own experience. The atmosphere for CS at CSUSB is great. I highly suggest you take advantage of the resources. It is a competitive field, despite what the news says about CS. Join the CISO club, attend the seminars, hiring events, etc. Network like your life depends on it. The IST professors are great and will be a good tool to help advance your career. My assumption is the MS program builds directly off the BS program but that may not be entirely true depending on your concentration. If it is anything like the BS program, then i would recommend it. Also, look into the Scholarship for Service program. In a nutshell, if you qualify for the scholarship you will receive money to pay for school in exchange for your service to a government agency after graduation. That applies to both BS and MS programs. As for job prospects, I have a job lined up right out of graduation next month with a large \"tech\" company (not one of the big 5 but still respectable.) The best guarantor for lining up a job after graduation will be from connections you make through the school resources or the SFS program. Unfortunately, for CS students, many companies are still hesitant to hire newbies with no experience in the field despite CSUSB's solid reputation. That is not to say you cannot find a job without those resources, certainly you can. However, if they offer any leg up, why not use them. Lastly, I want to add, the undergrad program gives you enough exposure to help you find your niche in CS. If you already have one, hone in on it in the MS program. Hope this helps you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.csusb.edu/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-center/programs/cybercorpsr-scholarship-service](https://www.csusb.edu/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-center/programs/cybercorpsr-scholarship-service)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.csusb.edu/cybersecurity/student-resources/student-clubs/cyber-intelligence-and-security-organization-ciso](https://www.csusb.edu/cybersecurity/student-resources/student-clubs/cyber-intelligence-and-security-organization-ciso)",

As a CS department student, were you allowed to take IST courses?\n2. How good are the networking opportunities, including the job fairs? Is it reasonable to expect FAANG?\n3. And finally, would you say your learning experience leaned more on the practical/experiential side or the theoretical side?",

                            "comment": "1. IST courses are a bulk of the CS (Cyber Security) curriculum. For undegrads, you have a couple of Accounting courses and one Finance course but that won't matter much if you are in the Master's program. However, try to focus more on the course descriptions rather than the titles. CSUSB can be a little strange in the way they structure class descriptors. For example, \"Business Systems I\" is pretty vague. In reality, it is an introductory Python programming course. Advanced Business Systems is an upper-division object-oriented study of Python programming. Moreover, my Junior and Senior year have been structured around many IST courses. I took 3 different IST courses that individually prep you for the A+, Network+, and Security+ CompTIA certification exams. So, if you are a diligent, you could potentially leave CSUSB with 3 industry-respected certifications. I also took courses on IT Governance and Policy as well as Ethical Hacking and Pen-Testing. The scope is very wide, as I mentioned in my initial response. \n2. Regarding networking opportunities, you will have to put in some work. You are competing with hundreds of other students. FAANG opportunities are not impossible, but I would not count on it. I cannot recall any major events where FAANG has advertised internships or job openings through the job-fairs. Don't quote me on that though. It is also important to remember that CSUSB is not an  engineering school so that does affect the job prospects. Additionally, CSUSB's Cyber program is government-oriented in many ways. One of their large advertisements are their government contracts through SFS and their reputation with the DOJ, DHS, NSA, and so forth. Alternatively, this notoriety will be good for students in the private-sector. \n3. You will certainly have a nice share of conceptual-based learning. In my experience, most of the professors I have had do a pretty good job and finding ways for students to implement the knowledge. For example, my IT Governance and Policy course was really just a ton of reading and some quizzes. BUT, my professor required students to group together to create a project where we actually had to apply the knowledge. We were subsequently judged by a room of students and the professor to simulate a real-world experience. Of course, there are some classes where you just read a bunch of stuff, take a quiz, and that is it. Those are the classes where your interest in the material needs to outshine to pursuit of a satisfactory letter grade. Truthfully, that statement should apply to every course you're taking. I find if you are interested in the subject, it's much easier and more enjoyable because you are less willing to give up. If you are not getting enough hands-on experience to quench your thirst, leverage the CISO and InfoSec clubs to fill the gaps. Partake in side projects to build on what you are learning. Not only will those projects develop your technical abilities, they are useful talking points for interviews and can even be listed on a resume if the outcome was substantial. \n\nHope those responses were not too long winded. Feel free to keep asking questions.",

Out of these 5 I'd be interested in OS and Algorithms maybe, but the other three are just not interesting enough (TOC, Computer architecture, SE), considering that I've already done all 5 in my undergrad. And the elective courses themselves are very lacking, there's basically no electives for cybersecurity or related at graduate level in CSE, and there's only very few in the IST department. Most of the courses you spoke about having done are actually 3000 and 4000 level courses, which are not allowed to be taken by graduate freshmen, and we're pretty much limited to 5000(3 courses max) and 6000 level courses.\n\nThere is a dearth of flexibility in the program that is definitely off putting, I think I'll probably get in touch with my graduate advisor to confirm or get a better view.",

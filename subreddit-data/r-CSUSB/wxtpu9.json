Seriously, the price of college has increased exponentially in recent decades and is continuing to do so. The 10k forgiveness is nice, but T. Morales didn\u2019t make it happen, and if he truly cared about \u201cadvancing his students\u2019 post-degree lives,\u201d he would find a way for CSUSB to lower tuition to something remotely reasonable instead of just saying \u201cgood news! Someone else did something so now I don\u2019t have to!\u201d\n\nThat being said, this is a big W for papa Joe. This is the kind of no-malarkey policy I wanna see, Jack!",

I feel like csusb is quick to take our money but when it's time to give us our FAFSA when need to buy books and also housing they are slow about it. I bet they wouldn't want to be in our shoes. But I ask them to step in our shoes for a few mins and see how far they get.",

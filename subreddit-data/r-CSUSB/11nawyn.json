If you have an internet link to a video on a publicly published service like youtube, then you can probably send the link without a problem.\n\nProfessors automatically retain full copyright of any videos they produce and students don't have the right to use them for any reason besides watching them in class.  If the video is actually stored in the student portal, then it hasn't been put there for public distribution.  The campus IT department may be able to track exactly who has accessed videos on any campus servers, in case you're wondering.",

Therefore, anyone with a link to the video is legally allowed to watch it.   How they got the link doesn't really matter.  Once the professor makes the video publicly accessible via youtube, the cat's out of the bag, so to speak.  It can't be undone from a legal point of view.   \n\nIf the video doesn't contain information like answers to homework, quizzes or exams, I don't think any valid claims of cheating or other student conduct violations could be supported.",

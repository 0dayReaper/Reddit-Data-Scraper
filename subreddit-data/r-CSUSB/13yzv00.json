You wouldn't \"owe\" 3.9k, just the difference between the cost and the pending financial aid. Even then, there are different payment options you can do, but it is normal to see the upcoming term cost. There are more factors that come into play when determining your financial stance and how much you would have to pay out of pocket, so I highly recommend you getting in contact with the Office of Financial Aid in order to get a accurate explanation of how your financial situation is.",

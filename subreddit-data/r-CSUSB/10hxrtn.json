My counselor said it might be better to enroll in the on campus program, but register for the online classes. The only difference is that you're not 100% guaranteed an online class (like if a class is filled up fast). Keep in mind I was looking into it 2020. I don't know if fees have changed.",

I wasn't interested anymore after my first semester but the one class that I took for that major went really well. All I can say is that they definitely have good resources for that major here if that's what you decide to do",

Some want students to come in person on exam dates, others want you to take the exam during zoom sessions, most are just asynchronous though in my expierence. I definitely think it's manageable if you're working full time and going to school part or full time.",

I feel very lonely as I am the only one who applied to CSUSB and I know I am the only one as our school is the only one in the town.\n\nHow is the social environment? I really want to join softball intermural to try it or try other clubs.\n\nI am in the pre-nursing program, but is it good? Any tips?",

My experience might be different from yours, since I had transferred from a community college where I felt like my hand was held the whole way, and going to a university seems like I was now on my own. That said, I had a great experience overall. \n\nCSUSB is a large commuter school, meaning a lot of students are local to the area and will drive to and from class each day and generally don\u2019t stay on campus. However, in my experience those who are in STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) type of classes do tend to stay on campus to study between classes. I\u2019d encourage you to form study groups in your core classes, because you\u2019ll likely see the same people repeatedly for the next few years as you guys complete your major together. When you guys partner up in labs, exchange contact info. Maybe you\u2019ll find that you share more in common than just nursing!\n\nThe nursing program is a great one; some people pursue it all the way and some people end up switching their majors. Please keep in contact with your academic advisor and understand your academic journey so you can plan ahead of time.  You\u2019re in good hands whether you decide to stick with nursing or end up changing your mind. Pre-nursing classes overlap with a lot of other great financially-rewarding career paths such as registered dietitians, dental hygienist, physical therapy, etc. My friend switched from pre-nursing to chemistry, and he is now applying to a PhD program in chemistry to ultimately teach at universities.\n\nIt would definitely help if you could make yourself known to your professors by physically visiting office hours, talking to them before or after class, sending emails, etc. That way, when it comes to requesting a letter of Rec, faculty will already have a face to your name. They teach hundreds of students each year, so having on-going communication will help faculty understand you beyond your grades if that makes sense. This results in a much better-quality recommendation letter.\n\nThat\u2019s great that you\u2019re already looking into joining an intramural softball club! Outside of my core classes, I made really good friends in my extracurricular classes (photography class, exercise classes), the gym (the gym also offers classes), and joining clubs. Not sure if they still exist, but when I was in undergrad, they had a salsa club and a swing dancing club! Which I had tried those ones!\n\nAnyway, welcome to CSUSB! It\u2019s a great school on the up and up, and you\u2019ll get out of it whatever you put it. Seek and you shall find haha. There are lots of opportunities and options at this school, and sometimes you just need to seek them out or network to find what you need. Best of luck to you!!",

They all went to West Coast or switched majors. My social life came from the dorms, clubs, and making friends in classes. You have to be proactive to make a social connection at this school hopefully you find a lot in softball or clubs that interest you. It is a commuter school, and many had jobs or were busy helping family. Good Luck!",

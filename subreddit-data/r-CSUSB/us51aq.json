    "postText": " So I have a dilemma where CSUSB says that I was enrolled in the fall 2021 semester, and since I failed my classes I owe them $2500 for the semester. I know I unenrolled in all my classes because I planned on going to UCR. I moved away recently and never received notification that I have \"OUTSTANDING CHARGES\" in their system. I cannot prove that I unenrolled in their system, and somehow the \"Middle-Class Scholarship\" grant was approved in their system. I never approved of such a thing since I dropped all my classes before transferring to UCR. I'm worried about this affecting my current financial aid at UCR and coming back to bite me. Will this be the case? Does anyone know what I can do?",

            "comment": "You don't make any sense. I'm going to assume you didn't \"unenroll\" officially because you just said that they failed you by giving you a grade; which means you were never out of the system. I personally have \"unenrolled\".. the correct term is dropped... I have dropped several classes and they send you an email and it's also on your mycoyote it shows you dropped it. If you didn't drop before a certain date usually a few weeks into the course csusb must give you a grade. Which means your GPA and financial aid are permanently effected. Again you know better than I do if you actually dropped or not. Call the financial aid office tomorrow",

            "comment": "You probably unenrolled from your classes but not from the university. Those are two separate things. You have outstanding charges because although you didn\u2019t take any classes, you were still technically \u201cattending\u201d CSUSB. So as of rn, if you haven\u2019t correctly unenrolled from the actual university, and because you failed all your classes you failed to meet the SAP requirement. This would mean that you will placed on academic probation, and your financial aid may be withheld from you until you submit an appeal explaining the extenuating circumstances as to why you couldn\u2019t complete your classes. Im not sure how this will affect you at UCR tbh. But as of rn you are still a student here",

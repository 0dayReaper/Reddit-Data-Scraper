I believe someone has him, I\u2019ve been to all near by shelters and he is nowhere to be found it is also not like him to run away. He is super friendly, loves to cuddle, he\u2019s just an absolutely gorgeous dog. Please let me know if you have seen him we are all completely heart broken. We just want him back, there is a reward for anyone who finds him.",

I totally get what you and your family are going through and the same happened with me when they took my dog, I had to track them down for 8 days to get him back. Everyone back home was devastated back then, so the way I found him was looking up websites where they sell pets and sure enough he was there(just be really polite with them and act like a genuine buyer) . Hope this helps in any way. Stay strong for the family, hope you bring him home.",

Good luck with everything though. Check Facebook marketplace or something similar to it. Just look within a 50 mile/ 75km radius from your place.",

            "comment": "An EFC of 0 doesn't mean that you'll get enough financial aid to pay tuition.  Students don't all pay the same tuition rates and they don't receive the same financial aid awards.   Non-resident tuition is a lot more expensive.  Financial aid can be a lot less for freshmen and sophomores than juniors, seniors, and grad students.\n\nFor example, many students from other states want to go to California public universities, but financial aid won't even come close to covering tuition and expenses.  You don't automatically become a resident for tuition purposes just by moving to California, like with some relative or friends, even if done years before attending.  In fact, moving to California merely to go to college is specifically excluded from being eligible for resident tuition.\n\nEven residents may have trouble paying tuition, and financial aid often doesn't fully cover living expenses.  A lot of factors are involved.   Be sure to check the box on FAFSA that you're interested in Federal work-study jobs because you may need it.  You may need to work at least part-time to afford student expenses.",

I was giving examples of situations in which an EFC of 0 will definitely not cover tuition.\n\nSince you say that only \"most\" of your expenses are covered, you still need to come up with the money for the expenses that aren't covered.   The expected family contribution of 0 doesn't mean that all necessary expenses will be covered by financial aid, which was my point.   The money will have to come from somewhere.  The school won't let you register for classes if you have an unpaid balance on your student account.\n\nThat's why many students have to work and still are eligible for food assistance programs.",

I\u2019m mostly just looking to see how much others with a similar EFC have to pay towards tuition, if they do. I was a student at csusb a few years ago, but I had to pay tuition out of pocket then. Thank you for your response.",

The max is only $7,500 for dependent students, and that $5K difference can make a huge difference.",

Thank you for your response, I feel a bit more confident proceeding with school. Living expenses are not an issue for me and I have enough savings to cover tuition if need be, but I prefer to not use it at the moment.",

Also, I would say little trash bags for the trash bins you get in your room because it's hard to get them sometimes. Make sure to download an app called \"payrange\" that's how you pay for the laundry machines on campus if you decide to do your laundry there. Maybe a desk lamp if you want to do hw in your room in the late hours so you don't have to turn on the lights disturbing your roommate (if you have one). *side note* coyote village does have study rooms on each floor that you can use.",

Many are closed and most of the rest are open Mon-Thu for only 4 hours per day.  No off-campus restaurant could survive with such poor service.  But they have a captive audience of Coyote Village residents who have no choice but accept whatever little service that is deemed minimally acceptable to dining services.",

They kept coming up w restaurants (Blue Sushi, the Mexican place, the personal pizza place) and they all closed within 2-3 weeks\n\nThey also fired most of the workers from those restaurants w no warning, which was horrible. \n\nNot to mention that the mandatory meal plan was a rip off bc they basically took away the breakfast option.",

I attended at a time when the food services were much better, but even then it wasn't very good compared to off-campus food or to other CSU campuses like Cal Poly Pomona, CSU Fullerton, CSU San Marcos, San Diego State, and many other campuses I've visted.   CSUSB has the worst food services I've ever experienced, and it's now ridiculously bad.   I attended at a time when food plans weren't mandatory for any resident students.  Service started getting much worse when the food plans started, since that supported the terrible service, quality, and value by providing a minimal level of demand by students who were forced or tricked into buying a meal plan.\n\nI don't want to be negative, but I'm more concerned about innocent students who have to suffer the results of having a meal plan.  My warning is this: don't use housing that requires a meal plan.  Don't attend CSUSB if on-campus housing with a mandatory meal plan is the only option.  It's not worth it.  You'll regret it.  I haven't met a single student who has a positive overall opinion of food on campus.  Not. A. Single. Student.   The situation isn't merely bad: it's terrible. It's unacceptable.  I think it's probably fraudulent at this point and may result in a lawsuit with major financial damages to compensate students for the lack of services that they paid to receive.",

    "postText": "Hello again!, so Yesterday I submitted my SIR to CSUSB for fall 2023, but was wondering about one thing. I enrolled and paid to take one summer class at my local community college. I emailed my counselor and she told me that CSUSB would no longer consider me as a first time freshman and instead might have to wait to transfer. Has anyone been in this situation or can help me?",

            "comment": "Drop the community college course immediately.  Yes, it can prevent you from being admitted as a freshman.   Once you graduate high school or get a GED, any college course that's officially attempted can eliminate freshman admission eligibility and require admission as a transfer student.   Transfer students must have 60 units and fulfill all transfer requirements.  CSU campuses do not accept transfer students who are freshman or sophomore in standing.  Only junior transfers are allowed, and only if they complete all the transfer requirements.\n\nSo if you attempt one community college course that is CSU transferable, then you're committed to applying as a transfer student.  If you drop the course before the official drop date deadline, then the course will not be listed as attempted on your community college transcript.   You also won't have to send your transcripts from that community college if you drop it in time.\n\nOnce you pass the first drop deadline, then it's too late because it will be on your transcripts as an attempted course, even if you get a W - for an official withdrawal.\n\nHowever, I think it's often better for students to attend community college and transfer to a CSU because it can save a lot money.  Community colleges are a better place to explore different majors too.   California community college can also guarantee admission to CSU campuses if an associates degree for transfer (AAT/AST) is completed.   \n\nhttps://icangotocollege.com/associate-degree-for-transfer",

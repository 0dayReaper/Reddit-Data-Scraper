            "comment": "Bro you\u2019re solid. You will probably get into any campus you want. Please note this is a California State University (CSU), not a University of California (UC). The biggest difference is that CSU\u2019s are usually cheaper and have a broader, general focus while UC\u2019s are usually much more expensive and are more research focused. Otherwise, the education you will receive is entirely up to the program you are in, the professors you get, the work you put in.\n\nGiven that you have built a resume in education, have experience in the field you wish to pursue, have demonstrated your interests and passion within education, you are a wonderful candidate for any school. What you need to focus on is letting them see that on paper. You will have to write an essay about you, not your accomplishments. Although you will talk about your accomplishments, your main focus should be why YOU deserve the opportunity to go to this school and how you will change the world doing it. This is what you call a statement of purpose (SOP). For that, I recommend you check out this link:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/comments/p7lfll?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=4",

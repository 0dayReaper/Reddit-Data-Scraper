    "postText": " \n\nTo the Campus Community,\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our campus, region and nation, Congress has again issued resources to colleges and universities as a part of the second Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, passed in late December.\n\nLike the first CARES Act, the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund has made available financial resources for the direct relief of students and to offset university operating losses and additional expenses related to the COVID-19 response.\n\n**CSUSB will allocate more than $13.1 million in direct relief to students from these resources. The university will also allocate an additional $600,000 in direct institutional support to our students not covered by the second CARES Act distribution, bringing total student awards to nearly $14 million.**\n\nWorking closely with campus leadership, a distribution formula has been developed that weighs multiple factors, including each student\u2019s full-time or part-time status as well as household income. Emergency relief funds will be delivered in a one-time disbursement.\n\n**Students who currently have an outstanding balance on their student account will receive emails and push notifications this week encouraging them to have their award applied to this balance first and any remaining amount sent to them directly. Please reply to the messaging no later than Friday, March 12 at 5 p.m.**\n\nWhen distributions begin, students with direct deposit information already on file with the university will have their emergency relief funds electronically transmitted to that account. For all other students, a paper check will be mailed to the address on file. If you need to update your mailing information with CSUSB, please do so via your MyCoyote Student Portal by Friday, March 12 at 5 p.m.\n\nWe anticipate students will receive payments by March 31.\n\nSincerely,\n\n**Toma\u0301s D. Morales**  \nPresident",

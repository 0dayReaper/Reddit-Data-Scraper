    "postText": "I was accepted to begin my 3 year MSW program in August. However, I am debating on changing my track to the 2 year program. I will be resigning from my full time job right before the semester starts and working was the main reason as to why I chose the 3 year track.\n\nCan anyone give me some insight on the 2-year MSW program if you have gone through it or currently going through it? The only thing I worry about with the 2 year track is the field practicum being 16 hours a week for the first year.",

I don\u2019t know your personal situation but I have 3 children so I know for me the commitment is hard but I also didn\u2019t want to get to that third year and think, damn I could be done already. There is also the almost extra 10k from taking another year.",

It\u2019s just hard to commit because I\u2019m already burnt out from working full time for the last few years. I know that when I start in the two year program, I\u2019ll have to dedicate 16 hours a week to field placement which is just working for free. :/",

I\u2019m looking at it as gaining the knowledge that I will need in order to be successful in my field. Whether you do the two year or three year track, you will still need to put in those two years of internship. You just need to decide if you want to do it now or later.",

I\u2019ll be moving to the area from my home 5 hours away and have no connections down there. I\u2019m nervous about on-campus housing too. Please let me know how your experience was finding housing down there! (Feel free to message me)",

Of course you\u2019re going to meet people who may not match the same wave length as you, but that\u2019s something that can happen ANYWHERE. Even in classes you\u2019re bound to meet lots of people along the way! I\u2019ve met tons and many of them so happen to be dorming as well! \ud83d\ude0aSo just come into this experience with an open mind! Don\u2019t be shy to say hi to someone and introduce yourself, especially to people you will be living with \ud83e\udd17, get to know them!Don\u2019t be scared to express a liking in someone, people LOVE hearing compliments and especially if they\u2019re genuine. And most importantly be YOU. the right people will love you. i hope your experience goes just as great! and that youre put into a household full of amazing and welcoming people \ud83d\ude07And good luck on your journey &lt;3",

Some of the areas right outside school are the safest and best, but i highly suggest looking at riverside, fontana, and ontario. Ontario mills and victoria gardens are some really nice malls to visit if you wanna get off campus and do some shopping. You\u2019re an hour away from the beach, disneyland, six flags, TAKE ADVANTAGE!\nOH and MY BIGGEST PIECE OF ADVICE, get to know the campus and the resources it offers\u2026 there\u2019s a grocery store u can visit varios times a week and get FREE food, shampoo, tooth paste\u2026there\u2019s a student wellness center that offers a place to relax in hammocks \ud83d\ude0c even a place for you to study with meditation music",

Well for the most part people i\u2019ve come across are very respectful of the space and won\u2019t make any noise to disturb, if you choose to, you can really be to yourself and in your own little bubble and NO ONE a will bother \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "Hey! Congrats on the acceptance. From my experience on-campus housing was not terrible. I had some really good roommates but I\u2019ve heard horror stories from others. It honestly is just left to luck. Off campus I didn\u2019t try searching as I heard the surrounding areas aren\u2019t great. The city of San Bernardino is pretty rough, I would recommend avoiding downtown San Bernardino. But the area around the school is pretty safe so if you find something around that area you should be fine. If you\u2019re ok with being like at 20-30 min away from campus I would recommend looking around Redlands or Loma Linda.",

Statement from the school: \n\n\"The situation with the pandemic remains extremely fluid, and campus health and well-being is my primary concern. Therefore, with the resurgence of COVID and the Omicron variant in our region, and nationally, in consultation with campus leadership I am announcing that the Cal State San Bernardino Spring Semester will open for remote/online instruction for the majority of courses on January 22, 2022, and remain virtual until February 18, 2022. Virtual instruction allows us to further slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting the number of additional individuals on campus on a daily basis. Notifications will go out to students in courses which require in-person, face-to-face instruction for how such instruction will be delivered. University operations will continue to remain open for in-person and remote services. Information on the status of specific on-campus events will be provided on an event-by-event basis.\"",

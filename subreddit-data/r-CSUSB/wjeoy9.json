    "postText": "This semester all but one of my classes are online so I will only be on campus an hour two days a week. I don\u2019t think this is enough time to justify buying any parking passes especially because I\u2019m in a really tough financial spot right now. My question is would it be feasible to park somewhere farther away and walk to class, a place where my car is safe? Does anyone know of any spots?",

It is public property so it's acceptable and you'd be walking maybe 20 mins max?\n\nHaven't looked to see if there's any parking warnings or rules but I'm sure you'd fine a spot you can use.\n\nAs for safety, the neighborhoods near campus don't seem sketchy so I'd say you'd be fine.",

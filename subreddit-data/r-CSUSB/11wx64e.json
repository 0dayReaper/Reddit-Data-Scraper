    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI am starting my first year of the 2-year MSW program this Fall. I am wanting to obtain my PPS credential as well but I know CSUSB doesn\u2019t offer it through social work. The department says that I can do all my training hours and then apply to (I think) UCLA when I graduate and they will accept the hours and issue my credential, along with taking 5 Saturday classes. Has anyone had experience obtaining their PPS credential this way? I am just worried about doing all of the extra internship hours needed and then hitting a huge bump in the road. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

I think CSUSB has an agreement with UCLA where they would accept our internship hours after graduation and issue the credential along with the 5 classes, which I was told is only 2k and I can take them the first summer if I wanted. I\u2019ll have to look into Redlands to see the cost and requirements.",

The only off campus housing ( the Glen) is ok, not ideal but you\u2019ll be better off with other students since the Glen isn\u2019t just for students so you\u2019ll have random as roomates too. The area around the school is decent, but anything on the outskirts isn\u2019t safe lol.",

            "comment": "Living on campus is much safer. At this point, it might be difficult to find housing as it is pretty late in the process. Still, you should try. I suggest University Village if you can get an apartment there. University Village is mostly upperclassmen.\n\nContact housing about questions. Their email is on https://www.csusb.edu/housing.",

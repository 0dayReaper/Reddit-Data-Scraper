Pace yourself and maybe put together a study schedule so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. On the days you don\u2019t go to class relax as much as you can do you feel refreshed later. I feel the same way at the beginning of every semester but doing these things helps. Good luck and good luck at the gym!!",

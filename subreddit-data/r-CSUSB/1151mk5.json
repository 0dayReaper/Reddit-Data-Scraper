Is the psych department good here? and is it dangerous. I will be commuting and I am not used to a big campus. I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019ll be dangerous and the same with parking.",

From my experience as a male, I haven\u2019t been in a fight or flight situation nor in a moment of fear. Campus has some poles with a phone on it in certain areas in case you feel uncomfortable and I also see a fair amount of police units around campus from time to time. Cpted of campus is okay but my opinion is we need some more light.",

            "comment": "If you're commuting, it's the drive and traffic that's the most dangerous part you need to be concerned about.  I suggest that you get good auto insurance with comprehensive, collision, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, a decent dashcam, alarm system, and 4G LTE GPS tracker.  Never leave anything of value in your car unless you assume that it'll be gone when you get back.   You can do a BA/BS Psych at any CSU, won't make any difference so long as you get a good gpa in prep for grad school, since you may need a masters degree to find work or advance in many careers.   There are more psych degrees granted than any other major, about twice as many as the 2nd most popular one.\n\nYou can see the degree stats for yourself [here](https://tableau.csusb.edu/#/site/PublicFacing/views/DegreesConferred/DegreesConferred?:iid=8)\n\nNo need to worry about the quality of the psych department.  The bigger question is the value of any psych degree because of how many are granted vs. the career openings for graduates.  I can't answer that question, but you can research the options at the career center.",

            "comment": "Lol I'm glad I've never seen that/run into them on campus. I think I would genuinely stop and ask them logical questions about why they're doing this. most of the ppl who are pro life don't even give money to any charities that would help moms or children, or don't even give money to try and help orphaned children or children in the foster care system. Most of them definitely don't have any adopted children either. How do you care so much about an unborn child but put zero efforts into improving current conditions that would cause a women to decide not to have a child?? They will say \"just give the baby up for adotion\" but don't give AF about what happens within the foster care system. I just don't understand why people want to control women's bodies like that and judge someone for not wanting to bring a child into this world when there are already so many children who are already living in poverty or belong to the system with no parents. It's fucked up that they think they would know what's best for someone else's life and their unborn baby's life.. Anyway that's my 2 cents.",

What should the community do?  Illegally violating the demonstrators' constitutional rights only wastes public tax money when they win a lawsuit.  You have the same right to protest your views that are different or oppose theirs.  If they were prevented, then you can be prevented.  That's how the first amendment works.\n\nGo to the health center to see what services are offered to see how women are supported in fact.   Go to the [Santos Manuel Student Union Women\u2019s Resource Center (WRC)](https://www.csusb.edu/smsu/resources/womens-resource-center).\n\nThe opinions of some random protesters has little effect other than shaking some air molecules nearby them with the voices.  It has literally no effect on support for women on campus.\n\nThis is part of attending a public university paid by public tax dollars.   Your ability to ignore them is unlimited, if you choose to develop that super power.",

Funny how quick everyone is to support FrEe SpEeCh but not division of church and state, a right in the Bill of Rights. Gen Z is overwhelmingly in support of abortion rights and women are traumatized right now by the policing of our bodies, so no it\u2019s not just \u201cshaking of air molecules\u201d.

There's no fetus blocking the door to the lecture or shouting at you in the classroom.  If you don't value yourselves/education because of them, you need to grow a backbone and thicker skin.\n\nThe way you win is to get your degree, make money, vote based on your beliefs, and participate in causes that you support.   How are they gonna prevent you from doing that?  They aren't.  You do you boo.",

Then consider what the consequences for that might be as far as economic inequality. For example, men are likely to be underrepresented in the majority of fields except 2 out of 15th and won't experience the economic growth of those other fields. \n\n2. Where are the conversations on men's mental health? All things considering they have higher rates of suicide and self-harm. You hear a lot about it for women on campus.\n\n3. The campus in March is ALWAYS hosting a very significant Women's History Month event with several to follow throughout the month. \n\n4. Faculty can't seem to answer questions when you ask them to explain why men are the lead representatives of the homeless population, homicides, incarceration (for similar crimes that data shows women get less time or no jail for), and likewise report being sexually abused at about the same rate with 70% of them saying it was a woman who abused them. They'll explain other disparities where men aren't struggling and advocate for those communities but never male students. \n\n5. They propagate the \"male privilege\" myth that barely exists on a campus of largely middle class and below students and can't fathom how out of touch that is.\n\nWith all these in mind, where's International Men's Day? Where's the Men's Resource Center? Where's the urgency to increase male graduation rates which are as low as male K-12 rates because we're telling guys they're all privileged rapists? Can go on and on.",

However, the issue's I am speaking to are centered on women, who are still, economically and socially disadvantaged.\n\nIf you feel like there is a disparity in treatment at the university I urge you to speak to the appropriate administration. CAPS is also a resource and they are open to men and women. But please don't be angry that the school is trying to help women. \n\nUnfortunately male privilege is not a myth in many industries, especially the ones that make the most money, like the engineering and finance field. \n\nSexual abuse stats is 1 in 5 women vs 1 in 71 men. That one is pretty obvious. \n\nSingle moms vs single dads is 80% to 20% respectively, with single father households better off financially. \n\nWomen have been historically oppressed, with Native American women not even having the full right to vote in many states as late as 1962. \n\nWomen are now getting their reproductive health taken from them. Men are still fully in control of their bodies and they won't be pushed out of any industry they want to enter. \n\nData has shown that as the number of women in a field go up, the pay goes down. A 2019 LeanIn study showed that approximately 60% of male managers feel uncomfortable engaging in everyday job-related activities with women. \n\n At the current rate of progress, it will take another 108 years to reach gender parity, according to the World Economic Forum\u2019s most recent Global Gender Gap report.  \n\nWomen are 47% more likely to suffer severe injuries in car crashes because safety features are designed for men.\n\n22% of AI professionals are women - and it could be down to lack of confidence.  \n\nFor every female film character, there are 2.24 men\n\nSeventy-six per cent of workplaces on don't offer any form of support for menopause symptoms. \n\nSurvey after survey finds parents are more likely to teach their sons core breadwinning skills like how to build credit and invest their money. \n\nOur built in support systems at CSUSB are not a hindrance to you. I could go on and on with stats and data but if you want to win the oppression Olympics go ahead. Also in case you didn't notice the women's issues I am listing are mostly driven by men, the issues you as men deal with are not caused by women.\n\n\"They propagate the \"male privilege\" myth that barely exists on a campus of largely middle class and below students and can't fathom how out of touch that is.\"\n\nAverage income in USA: \\~$70,000\n\nCSUSB: \\~$55,000, definitely not middle class. What does that have to do with anything anyways?",

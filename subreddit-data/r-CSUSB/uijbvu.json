            "comment": "Any KINE class is fun! \nI took Soccer and you just warm up and play the entire time. \nBody conditioning is just workout circuits \nJogging is just warming up and running around campus and sometimes the trails behind\n\nSOC 1100: It\u2019s a Latino Community Class and it\u2019s so easy and the assignments are not that hard. The professor is Yanira Fuentes. You do like 4 1 page write ups on a super easy book, 2 easy exams all multiple choice, and smaller assignments. She does take attendance and marks u down if you\u2019re late\n\nFIN 1001: It\u2019s a class about financial choices in life. The professor I took it w is William Stevenson. It\u2019s weekly quizzes that he gives the answers to in class and homework that\u2019s like Inquizative (you pay and do it, but it\u2019s super easy and it\u2019s you get full points once it\u2019s done) \n\nASTRO 3000: I took this w Kathleen Devlin and it\u2019s so easy. Weekly tests and answers are in the book and online. Plus like six easy homework assignments. \n\nCAL 3750: It\u2019s an Islam class (you learn about the religion and Islamic Culture) I took it with Dr. Dany Duoeiri and he is by far the nicest man &amp; professor I have ever met. Class is literally just completing modules and weekly quizzes that are easy. He does do attendance quizzes so u have to pay attention. He also gives away gift cards in class. \n\nSSCI 3000/3001: I took these classes with Corrie Cataldi/Rooze and they were so easy. Just watch the lecture videos, do the discussion post and take a quiz every other week. Exams are easy and sometimes questions from the quizzes and a term paper is due at the end (she is a easy grader)\n\nCD 2240: it\u2019s an intro to child development class and the professor is Stacy Morris. No exams, quizzes have unlimited attempts, 1 week grace period for any late assignments, several activities which are easy. Assignments are just prep for you to finish and turn in a literature review of your choosing. Also does not take attendance.",

    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI'm looking to relet my apartment. I'm looking to move out, by the latest, April 1st. I'll be moving to Latin America for work. This relet lease will last from April 1st through July 31st. I'm willing to pay half your rent for the duration of the lease. This is the equivalent of your first two months free. The apartment is furnished with a bed and a desk. Please let me know!",

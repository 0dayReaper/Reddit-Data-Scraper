            "comment": "Hi!  Let me welcome you to CSUSB!\n\nI'm going to take the liberty to offer you a little important advice based on my experience that will help you for the rest of your college efforts, and that you're unlikely to hear from anybody else.\n\nNobody can plan your possible schedules better than you for yourself.  Nobody really cares as much as you about your schedule.  Nobody will be able to put in the care and time that you have available for your own needs.\n\nTherefore, it's not a good strategy to rely a lot on others for your specific schedule and registration.  The more you do for yourself, the higher chances that you'll get a schedule that works best for you.   Self-help is the best help, in this case.\n\nFor example, I probably spent at least 10-20 hours for every term in planning my schedule options before registration.  Most students don't do this and many of them end up with the worst teachers in the worst classes, while I got the best ones.   I think the time I spent planning was well worth it to save me weeks and months of turmoil and anguish trying to tolerate the worst classes.\n\nWhat did I spend so much time doing?   I made a list of all the courses that I could pick and then I prioritized them in order of importance.  Prerequisites for other courses were always higher priority because they block progress in completing that sequence if not done first.\n\nI read every single review of the professors and courses that I could find to build my own accurate assessment of them.  I used this to create a blacklist of professors and courses that I intended to avoid as much as possible.  I didn't want to discover these bad professors too late, after already going to class to find them.\n\nGoing to campus and parking often takes a lot of time, so I made it a priority to reduce the trips to campus during the busiest times.  I loved night classes and Saturday/Weekend courses because the campus is often very hot during the day and parking is much easier on weekends.\n\nI was able to usually go to campus only 2 days a week, either Monday+Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday, usually after 4pm.\n\nHaving to go to campus and fight the parking situation at the busiest times for just one class was the worst outcome for me, so I successfully avoided that situation.\n\nThe counselors don't care about any of these things.  They will load up your schedule with terrible classes at terrible times with terrible professors and not care one bit.\n\nThat's why I'm taking the effort to help you and others avoid these problems.\n\nHere's are some final tips:  always, always, always complete your registration as soon as possible.   Don't wait minutes, hours or days after you're allowed.  Every minute you wait could prevent you from getting the last open spot in the best classes, forcing you to choose a worse schedule that what you could've gotten.\n\nEvery semester, hundreds of students have their entire course schedule automatically dropped due to non-payment of fees.  If you really need to get a course that's full, you can find these deadlines and refresh the registration screen for the courses to become available.   Those students are screwed and can't add the courses anyways after they lose them, because it usually takes many days to fix the payment problem.   Those dropped courses become available on a first-come-first-served basis in the registration and are not automatically assigned to students on the waitlist.\n\nYou can also frequently refresh the registration screens while you're sitting in class that you haven't gotten yet.   Many times I was able to enroll in a course this way while other students didn't get in.   It's a competition where the students who try the hardest often can find ways to beat others for getting the courses they need.",

Even though the building itself isn't all that special, being a renovated Carrows, the food and service is superb for the area.   Some other good options are the Yang Noodle House or Sushi Miguel\u2019s Style.",

We have 3 kids in our party of 13 so we\u2019re going to Johns Incredible Pizza because they close at 10:30 and we don\u2019t have to deal with getting a large table. I\u2019m saving Le Rendez-Vous Cafe for another day for sure though. Thank you for the suggestion!",

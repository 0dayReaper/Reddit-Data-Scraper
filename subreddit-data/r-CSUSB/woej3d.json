    "postText": "I think for everybody the finical aid disbursements, or when they are applied to your account, were on the 11th of this month (8/11/2022). But nothing happened that day for me and neither for a friend of mine. I have direct deposit set up and don't have any other charges dues besides Fall now. I'm not sure if this happened to me last year but from what I see in my finical acticvity was that all aid went through the same day as well.  I'm kinda worried that I have some sort of hold or issue with enrollment that I can't see, my \"Holds\" and \"Tasks\" are empty. Did anybody have their financial aid go through?",

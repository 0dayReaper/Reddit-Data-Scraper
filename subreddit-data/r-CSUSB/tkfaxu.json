    "postText": " \n\nHi Everyone! My Sports and Entertainment Marketing Class and I are putting on this golf tournament, and all the proceeds go to the Sports and Entertainment Marketing Scholarship at the College! If anybody knows anyone in the San Berardino or Inland Empire area please let them know about this! And if anyone wants to buy tickets or donate there will be a question asking if a student directed you to purchase, if you could put my name that would be appreciated since selling tickets is a part of the grade! Thank You!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested you can purchase your tickets here\n\n[https://springgolftournamnet.ticketleap.com/](https://springgolftournamnet.ticketleap.com/)",

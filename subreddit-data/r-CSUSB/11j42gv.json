    "postText": "The title says it all. Every other program I applied to has *at least* a timeline on their website of when they start reaching out for interviews/decisions. I don't see anything like that on the program website for CSUSB. Their portal is also a bit different from the other programs I applied to so I have no idea where I'd even find out if I got an interview or accepted/denied. Any insight would be helpful! Thanks and good luck to everyone who applied!\n\n**Edit (for future applicants):** I ended up receiving an invitation for an interview on March 7th (I applied end of January) and had my interview the following week. I'm still waiting on their decision but feel free to message me if you have any questions! :-)",

I think each program sends out acceptance and denials but have some applicants that they don\u2019t advise because they are waiting to see if anyone rejects the offer and then can fill the spot. I\u2019d say send them an email so you can have a little peace of mind on where your application stands. Good luck!",

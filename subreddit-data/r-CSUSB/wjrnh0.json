    "postText": "I wanted to live near campus this semester at The Glen preferably, but all the single occupancy's are taken, and was wondering if anybody had one that they wanted to transfer to somebody else? I'll gladly take it. Just DM or reply to this post, or if you know somebody that wants to transfer a lease, please let me know. I'm male, 20 years old.",

    "postText": "I am looking to sublease my room at the Glen apartments, literally down the street from Cal State San Bernardino. the lease is only up for a few more months and I will no longer be staying there. So instead of just occupying an empty room I\\`d much rather give it to someone who needs it. the rent is 850 with utilities included, private restroom, fully furnished, parking spot included, washer and dryer in building. please do not hesitate to message me with any questions you may have",

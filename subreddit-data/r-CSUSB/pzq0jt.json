    "postText": "If you live on campus or stay on campus after dark please be careful. Ironically enough I\u2019ve seen actual coyotes (sometimes a single one and sometimes in a pack) roam the campus. (Especially around the parking lots/dorms). So just walk with caution after dark. Just got home to the dorms Rn and saw a pack of them running towards the Serrano Village area.",

Never heard of them posing a threat to anyone and they're usually big ol chickens that want nothing to do with you. A little bit of yelling will most likely spook them and make them run if you're worried. They like roaming the campus because they eat the jackrabbits that are all over campus. Many nights I saw a coyote running away with a rabbit in its mouth.",

I've seen them trotting through the vacant lot on Georgia Boulevard down the street from the post office near the WalMart on Hallmark Parkway. They're probably not going to bother you, a human, but if you live off campus, you might want to keep your cats and your little dogs (if you have any) inside at night.",

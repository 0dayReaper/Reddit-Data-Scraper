    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am a first year grad student in the ma of social science and globalization program. I'm interested in starting a Bernie club since one hasn't been made yet. \n\nI got my history degree from CSUSB and I've never started a club but Bernie's message has struck a chord with me. His consistent voting record for being anti war, pro veterans, free college education, working to get money out of politics by continually opposing citizens united, access to medical care, raising the minimum wage, against the over reaching and illegal behavior of the nsa, the list goes on and on.\n\nI also know what its like to feel apathetic toward the political system we currently have but the polls and crowds continually show that Bernie is well on his way to overtake Hilary as the front runner for the Democratic party and consistently polls better than any Republicans meaning he's on his way to the white house. Only down side is there a quite a few people who are unfamiliar with his message (if that includes you, check out \n/r sandersforpresident)\n\nIf you feel like I do please comment or send me a pm and we can go from there. We need at least 5 people to make a club but my reach is limited bc reddit is basically the only social media I use. If you're interested and know others who might be or you simply have a Facebook, twitter, instagram account please spread the word and we can go from there. It'll be no problem getting faculty support and I believe we can use a lot of the groups on campus to draw attention to Bernie. I'm not very familiar with starting a club but if you're like me and want to turn this country around and in the right direction I cant wait to meet you. \n\nI'm on campus Monday/Tuesday/Thursday. Let's get started!",

I would be happy to join, but I am already stretched super thin with school, work, wife, and some other stuff so don't know how involved I could actually be.\n\nI re-registered as a democrat about a month ago just so I could vote in the primary for Bernie. Was registered as independent, but I wanted to make sure I could go out and vote for Bernie when the time came.\n\nEDIT: On campus Tuesday/Thursday/Friday but except for Tuesday I'm pretty much in class all day on Thursday and Friday.",

Well figure this out the most important thing we need right now is people to join. Can you meet me on Tuesday between 2-4pm?",

So I can't ever really say I'll be completely free with anymore than a weeks notice. I don't work at all on Tuesday/Thursday/Friday but in class most of the day. On Tuesdays, I am done by 3:50pm and can stay on campus for most of the day after that if I need to. Thursdays, I have a break from 3:50pm to 6pm and am done with my lab by 8:50pm if we needed to do something that late on campus. Friday I have one class but it runs 9-5 since it's field work.",

The fact that you're out of class when I go in can work to our advantage when we do tableling. What time do you normally start class on Tuesday? Damn I know that retail life though the schedules don't leave you much leeway. Um hm are you savy on Facebook? Would you want to build the page? What would you like this club to do? What aspects interest you? Maybe bc of your tight schedule it'd be best if we decide what you want to do rather then try to get you to every meeting or discussion? What do you think?",

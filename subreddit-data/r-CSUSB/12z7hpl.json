I'll tell you our results, my partner and I found that students who speak more than 2 languages (multilingual) experienced more academic stress than those who only speak 2 languages (bilingual) although the numbers were very close, we believe if we had more participants (we only had a total of 87) to take the survey the gap would be a lot bigger. We also found that females reported more stress than males. Thank you!",

            "comment": "The Entrepreneurship program is not only one of the best at CSUSB, it's one of the best on the whole west coast among all accredited business schools.  Although I didn't personally pursue that degree, I graduated at the top of my class with highest honors in business information management at CSUSB, so I could observe the program quite well.  The school director, Dr. Michael Stull, is one of the best for creating and promoting the program.  That makes a huge difference because he's the reason for the high rankings, nationally recognized awards, and so many industry partnerships.\n\nI would've personally pursued the Entrepreneurship program if it was available when I started my business degree, but alas I was already well down the InfoMgmt track before it was available.",

In general, the overall admit rate for graduate programs is above 60% at CSUSB, and the entrepreneurship graduate program has over 220 students admitted and enrolled.  That's a relatively large program, so lots of admit/seats means a lot of chances.  If you don't apply, then your chances are zero.  It's worth a shot, since you only have the application fee to lose, and even that can be reduced/waived for students based on financial need.   I suggest setting up a personal visit and tour to meet anyone in the department who's available, and possibly talk to some students in the program while you're there.",

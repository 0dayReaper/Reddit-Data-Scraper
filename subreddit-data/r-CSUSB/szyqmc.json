Figure at least 2.5-3 hours each way, not including walking to class.  You'll probably need to plan for 3.5-4 hours each way to ensure you get to class on time, including the chances of missed connections.\n\nThis route only takes about 25 minutes each way using the highways in a car, motorcycle or scooter (with enough power to ride at highway speeds).   Via city streets, a 150cc motorcycle or scooter would take about 45 minutes each way at 35-50mph.",

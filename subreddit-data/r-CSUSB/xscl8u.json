    "postText": "UC Grad Students: Lessons of the 2020 strike. Build R&amp;F committees! SAT., OCT. 1, 10AM PST - Live Zoom Meeting with Will Lehman, socialist autoworker running for UAW president\n\nYou are invited to join a Live Zoom Meeting on Saturday, October 1, 10:00 a.m. PST with Will Lehman, the Pennsylvania Mack Trucks worker and socialist candidate for UAW president. He is calling for the abolition of the UAW bureaucracy and the transfer of power to rank-and-file workers.  (FB WillforUAWpresident.org; [www.WillforUAWpresident.org](http://www.willforuawpresident.org/); Twitter @WillforUAWpres; Text (267) 225-6633) \n\nDue to the massive corruption scandal in the UAW bureaucracy, a federal monitor has taken over the union ordering for the first time in the union\u2019s 88-year history that rank-and-file members will be able to vote for the leadership of their union. Nationally UAW members will receive ballots by mail beginning **October 17** and should be mailed back by **November 18, 2022**.\n\nAs you know, your contract expires on September 30 between the UC system and the 48,000 tutors, readers, graduate student instructors and assistants, postdocs, graduate student researchers and research assistants in the United Auto Workers. Graduate students are the backbone of the university system across this country, providing your labor and expertise at low wages to the education of undergraduates and develop vital research that makes the UC system famous and rich.\n\nThe very same issues at the heart of the 2020 wildcat strike for COLA that was sparked by the actions of the UCSC grad students are raised again today. Absolutely nothing was resolved by the union\u2019s diversion into the NLRB with its Unfair Labor Practice complaint.\n\nIn a statement to UC workers, Will Lehman said, \u201cI stand completely behind the fight of academic workers throughout California. Whether you make your living on a campus or factory every worker is being hit by the rising cost of living and mistreatment on the job.\n\n\u201cAt the same time the UAW has completely abandoned the principle of no work without a contract and attempted to divert mass anger back behind the same pro-corporate Democratic Party and at times even Republicans. The result has been devastating for workers across the board as millions of dollars of our dues money goes to the same politicians responsible for gutting social programs, including the funding for public education at every level.\n\n\u201cAny genuine fight against concessions and to address the ongoing environmental crisis requires a turn out to the entire working class in California and internationally. My campaign is based on uniting all workers\u2014educators, health care workers, railroaders and dockworkers\u2014in a common struggle, which the union bureaucrats will not accept. It is for that reason that my campaign is prioritizing the building of the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC).\u201d\n\nWill Lehman is a socialist autoworker. He is advocating that workers in every industry form independent rank-and-file committees united in the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC) to communicate and unify their struggles internationally against capitalism: the source of austerity, war and climate change. \n\nDate Time: Oct 1, 2022 01:00 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)  \nJoin from a PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone or Android device:\n\n[Click Here to Join](https://us06web.zoom.us/w/84838073041?tk=hP2qOtafioV8022Cw8jpkQuZiGBTmucpWbf9A0sPBrM.DQMAAAATwL5C0RZQVV9mbHYyb1FaU0JjOVBfZk1oaGx3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;pwd=WjU3Y200S0E5RERXcXF2R0IxVEhadz09&amp;uuid=WN_LOc-CPZKRX6nHd_Ls-BD-Q)  \n Note: This link should not be shared with others; it is unique to you.  \n Passcode: 165840  \n [Add to Calendar](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/tZAldOGoqTgqHtXmuBT7c5CdgO2u7_aGltM5/ics?user_id=wFZHXoyCOJ6NcrhXPwnhyz4FMYWS0SK4PBFO-wScWivGC_6kWrg.BxaKYJdUHd7-p88J&amp;type=icalendar) [Add to Google Calendar](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/tZAldOGoqTgqHtXmuBT7c5CdgO2u7_aGltM5/calendar/google/add?user_id=QiYDVpZi2ArbprcaHwdBOY-1ND3MEuEoyiEd0D8En8nmVFgIizI.rzSaRcvOF2m2VMuX&amp;type=google) [Add to Yahoo Calendar](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/tZAldOGoqTgqHtXmuBT7c5CdgO2u7_aGltM5/ics?user_id=wU7810B4qBAgXpAtmcZWY13vQx2A3JHqzlGqIQ7tUlW-BVNcuHQ.iniWYarvEa754ySS&amp;type=yahoo)\n\n Or join by phone:\n\nUS: +1 929 205 6099 or +1 253 215 8782 or +1 301 715 8592 or +1 309 205 3325 or +1 312 626 6799 or +1 346 248 7799 or +1 386 347 5053 or +1 564 217 2000 or +1 646 931 3860 or +1 669 444 9171 or +1 669 900 6833 or +1 719 359 4580  \n Webinar ID: 848 3807 3041  \n Passcode: 165840  \n International numbers available: [https://us06web.zoom.us/u/kxV47WrvK](https://us06web.zoom.us/u/kxV47WrvK)\n\nHelp spread the word!

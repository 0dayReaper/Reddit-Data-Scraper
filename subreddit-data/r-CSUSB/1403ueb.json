I don't recommend taking the bus, which will be way more wasting time. Be prepared for around 100-mile round trip, so plan your commute and your class schedule accordingly. I was lucky because my Tuesday Thursday classes were both online, so I only have to drive Mon and Wed. I also carpool with my buddy and we take turns in driving our car. I drive him on Monday and he drives me on Wednesday",

I am going to try aiming for a hybrid class scheldule like yours, I think it will be very doable since I am going for cybersecurity. That carpool thing you did sounds very helpful, maybe I will run into a person one day that I can carpool with!",

Half my classes were literally only \u2018read these things and write about it\u2019 - no recorded lecture, no PowerPoint slides, no teacher interaction. And the pathways program cost more than half of the price of the 2 year in person and like $10,000+ more than the 3 year in person, for worse teaching. If you just need the degree I guess go for it but if you actually want to learn, you\u2019re better off not doing this program and finding a different online one.",

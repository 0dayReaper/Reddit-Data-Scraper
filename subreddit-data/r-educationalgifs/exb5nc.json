It may actually make the problems worse because you now have to excavate that area and compact it or stabilize with mechanical means none of this will be possible if you have  a massive turd of grout shown in this technique. It also can get really expensive because that amount of grout can be fairly small or super large depending on the voids. I would be fairly certain that this method may be the easiest to execute on a fairly small sinkhole but large sinkholes require other techniques. I\u2019m an EE but I\u2019ve done a lot of Civil Work in the Utility Industry we often encounter sketchy geotechnical situations.",

Other sinkholes could form, other settlement issues could arise, long list of other problems could happen.  All depends on the geology and hydro geology of the area. It's probably a decent fix though for the short term (i.e. 30 years or so). \n\nBtw, when referring to underground water the term hydrogeology is more accurate, as hydrology focuses more on top of the land.\n\nSource: am geologist.",

There were some jobs that took over 200 cubic yards of grout to finish, while others would only take 40-70. For reference, a cement truck holds 10 cubic yards so 20 of those pumped entirely just to shore up one house",

Either humans would still be around, and presumably still be aware of what these things were, or there would be no humans around and there wouldn't be another intelligent human-like species for a very, very, very long time (if at all) to find them. By that point they would have certainly eroded away along with the dirt. Concrete (technically grout here) would fare less well than rock to the forces of erosion over that long of a time frame, and at that point this future civilization would be finding concrete all over the globe. They'd see these sinkhole plugs as more signs of a previous civilization. There would be people who debated on future internet forums about whether this civilization was aliens, or the fact that in 1998 the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer\u2019s table.",

The depth of the surrounding bedrock and the depth of the actual sinkhole are found out then.\n\nThe grout is pumped until a pressure threshold is reached, with the idea being that the less space there is to fill, the higher the pressure will be. Different pressures for different materials, and again the materials would have been logged during the investigation phase.\n\nThis fix is not a guarantee, I've investigated some properties that have been grouted and we have found no trace of grout under the property, it was simply pumped into the surrounding aquifer and washed away. A method I always preferred was underpinning, where steel rods are drilled into the bedrock and attached to the house, essentially putting the house on stilts around the sinkhole.\n\nI'm glad that is no longer my career, but it was definitely interesting.",

They built spitfires near here in WW2 so the area got bombed to hell, so the buildings that remain (and those in a fairly wide radius) have damage from the shockwave of the bombs.",

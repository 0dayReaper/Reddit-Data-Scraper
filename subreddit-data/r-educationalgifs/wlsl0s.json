So when water lands on it the dirt on the outer layer of the lump forms a protective barrier; dirt itself is not porous, so if there's no gaps between the particles it effectively forms a wall of protection for the dirt inside. Eventually the outside dirt will hydrate enough that it breaks apart, but then after that each layer of dirt is a new barrier that needs to be hydrated, which takes a long time.\n\nIn essence, the reason saturated dirt drains water faster is because it's millions of tiny particles forming a very loose layer like sand - so pouring water on it isn't so much pouring water *on* dirt so much as it is pouring it *through* dirt. But dessicated dirt forms one big solid almost like brick, so it acts like pouring liquid on to a hard surface.",

They're convection storms, caused by the buildup of heat near the ground that then rises into the cooler air above that condenses the water into clouds, then, if they're still warm enough and moving up far enough, into storms. The hotter and more humid the day, the more likely that is.\n\nThe lightning is caused by a combination of snow and graupel (wet ice particles) moving up and down in the rising air respectively due to their different density and surface area. They tap each other, and the graupel particle has a different quantum-work function so it collects electrons from the snowflake. They keep moving, causing a charge separation. Multiply by a few quadrillion and wait for the electricity to find its way home again, and BOOM! Sometimes it goes up into the cloud and rebalances, but sometimes it sees the ground which rearranges its charges to oppose the lower-cloud charge, and they discharge into each other. The remnant upper-cloud charge discharges into the ionosphere, creating sprites and UV-stopping ozone.",

When I water them it runs basically just straight trough and comes out of the drainage hole.     \nSo I've to put a saucer below so that catches the water and let it slowly soak in. Takes forever but it works.",

Most plants are somewhere in between those two extremes along a wide spectrum of conditions.  No matter what conditions you can imagine, there is probably a plant that will be perfectly happy.  I've worked with some plants where you can take a stick (not a sapling but literally just a stick) and put it in the bank of a river or pond slightly underwater and in a few year's time, you will have a happy and thriving tree.  I've also worked with some plants where watering them *ever* seems to be too much.",

Put at least 2 in every plant, for wider planters if they'll fit, put 1 or 2 just laying flat on the top of the soil, plus a couple around the edge normally.\n\nThat'll help get rid of the ones already in the adult stage. To get rid of the future generations, Mosquito Bits/Dunks. Well, specifically you just want to use BTI, which is a specific strain of bacteria that's harmless to basically every living organism, except for mosquito and gnat larvae. I like the mosquito bits, because I take them and put them in empty disposable tea bags, like you'd use for making loose leaf tea. Just fill it up, throw it in my watering can, and that's it. Just water normally, maybe letting the bits sit in the water for 30 minutes or so to saturate the can with the bacteria.\n\nAnd every 30 days or so, just change out to a fresh batch of mosquito bits. \n\nI've tried every other thing out there just about, and this is the only effective method I've found.",

But now, even if I bring a new plant home or use a new bag of soil that may have a few adult gnats, it never becomes an infestation because I only water with Mosquito Bits \"tea.\" \n\nHere's what I do: I keep a pitcher of tap water and jugs of rainwater for my more sensitive diva plants (collected as we get rainfall). I put about a teaspoon of MB into each of these containers and let it soak at least overnight, and this is all I use to water my plants. I never water with just plain water without MB. So any adults will eventually die and then the eggs and larvae never mature.\n\nSomething that I think most people don't know is that adult fungus gnats also lay their eggs in the drainage holes if the soil there stays wet. I found this out years ago when I bottom-watered a calathea with water and a little bit of Rose RX.\n\n[Video of thousands of fungus gnat larvae dying in water](https://imgur.com/a/PZjRYV0)",

I've tried neem oil, hydrogen peroxide soaks, letting the plants dry out completely, repotting into completely new soil... Gnats didn't give a single fuck about any of it\n\nThe sticky traps plus mosquito bits/dunks are a crucial combo. You'll have doubts, you'll see those yellow traps start turning black with the corpses of those seemingly infinite hellspawn. You'll come back and downvote my comment and think I'm full of shit.\n\nBut, after about 90 days, and maybe changing the sticky traps once or twice, you'll notice they'll be mostly empty. After that, it's just maintenance. Keep using the mosquito bits in your water, since it doesn't hurt anything and helps keep them from coming back. \n\nYour will has to be stronger than theirs. It's *your* home, goddammit, not theirs! And you'll be good and God damned before you'll let some lower lifeform take over your domicile!\n\nBut in the end, with sticky traps and mosquito bits, victory shall be yours, and you will reclaim your home as your own.",

The soil is healthy and can maintain nutrients better.\n\nIt's not so much about the looseness of the soil as it is the fact that there is water in the soil currently. When there is water in the soil currently, and you add more water, the water that's already in the soil attracts the new water through it's cohesive properties. That's why a damp sponge(which has uniform \"looseness\") will absorb water MUCH faster than a dry sponge.\n\nhttps://agwaterexchange.com/2016/08/14/understanding-the-basics-of-water-in-soils/\n\n&gt;There are two attractive forces that work together and affect the availability of water in soils. Water molecules are attracted to each other via cohesive chemical bonds. Although water (H2O) is a molecule, there is a positively charged end as well as a negatively charged end. These positive and charges are like the positive and negative terminals in a battery but current does not flow. So, water molecules are attracted to each other. This attraction is called cohesion. The water molecule is also attracted to soil particles. This is an adhesive force which is much stronger than the cohesive forces.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that water cohesion is how very tall trees form. If you know anything about pressure and suction, it's impossible to \"suck up\" water higher than 33.9 feet. That's because \"sucking\" isn't really a thing and in reality its the pressure of the atmosphere pushing water up a tube or pipe or something that has a lower pressure. When you suck on a straw you're lowering the pressure at the top of the straw and the air pressure that's pushing down on your drink forces the drink up the straw.\n\n 33.9 feet is the maximum height that you can suck water up, or pump it up by creating a perfect vacuum above it. The size of the tube or pipe or whatever does not matter. Other types of pumps can pump water and other materials well beyond this limit but they aren't doing it by creating a vacuum. \n\nSo with that said how to trees grow to be 300+ feet tall in some cases? Basically what happens is that the trees have very narrow pathways for the water to move through that have almost no air in them. These connect from the bottom of the tree all the way up to the top of the leaves where the water evaporates. When it evaporates the water that is leaving kind of \"pulls\" on the water because of its cohesiveness. \n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-large-trees-such-a/#\n\n&gt;\"In reality, the suction that exists within the water-conducting cells arises from the evaporation of water molecules from the leaves. Each water molecule has both positive and negative electrically charged parts. As a result, water molecules tend to stick to one another; that adhesion is why water forms rounded droplets on a smooth surface and does not spread out into a completely flat film. As one water molecule evaporates through a pore in a leaf, it exerts a small pull on adjacent water molecules, reducing the pressure in the water-conducting cells of the leaf and drawing water from adjacent cells. This chain of water molecules extends all the way from the leaves down to the roots and even extends out from the roots into the soil. So the simple answer to the question about what propels water from the roots to the leaves is that the sun's energy does it: heat from the sun causes the water to evaporate, setting the water chain in motion.\"\n\nLAST EDIT:\n\nA little riddle for you\n\n&gt;Take a wet sponge that weighs 200 grams and is 99% water weight. Now, squeeze out some water so that it becomes 98% water weight. What is the weight of the wet sponge now?",

It's incredibly obvious that the left most example simply has blades of grass providing pathways for air to get into the cup and displace the water. The right most example has an almost perfect seal on the other hand. \n\nFor this comparison to be any good at all all 3 cups would need to have a solid seal between them and the earth that's absorbing the water.\n\nYou could accomplish this by having large beakers or planters or something with the 3 different types of soil in them. As long as the beaker is taller than the surface of the soil you could pour a controlled amount of water on top of the soil and see how long it takes to go completely below the surface.",

            "comment": "Water in the ground, and between individual grains of dirt/sand creates a force, referred to as pore pressure, that pushes those grains apart.  Although different grain sizes, shapes, and material type effect the pore pressure in different ways, generally more water = greater pore pressure = less cohesive material.  \n\nThink of a McDonald's ball pit being filled with water.  The more water you add, the more likely the balls will want to float and move around.  When the pit has no water, balls just stack on top of each other and dont really move. Half full of water, you will get some balls pushing against others, creating different forces throughout the pit.  Water all the way to the top, and balls will spread out, and move almost freely, floating and bumping against each other. This is kind of like adding water too dirt.  The more water you add, the more mobility the dirt grains have, and eventually you just have an uncohesive material (mud).\n\nNow the big problem is when you have no water in the dirt.  Grains of dirt can be so small that they won't let water between them easily.  Instead of the dirt grains letting water seep down through them easily when there is some water in the ground, you might have a situation like a neatly stacked pile of bricks.  Sure water will eventually move through and soak into the bricks, but it will be so much slower.  The pathway for water to travel is much longer. Possibly water will have to seep down, create a bit of pore pressure to let more water in, then seeped down a bit farther, create more pore pressure a bit lower, and continue in this cycle.\n\nThis ability for water to seep into the ground is demonstrated in this gif quite well for surface water, but what happens when it is an entire aquifer?  This is the problem happening in many parts of the world, and notably parts of the south western United States.  Entire aquifers of groundwater are being pumped dry, and since all the dirt grains are stacking on top of themselves, making new water penetration extremely slow, aquifers won't ever fill again until the pumping stops.  Refilling can take in the order of thousands to millions of years.",

This obviously has diminishing returns once a material becomes saturated, at this point earth can start to act like a liquid, and you get things like land slides.\n\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp960148y#:~:text=Equations%20for%20an%20adsorption%20isotherm,at%20large%20surface%20pressures%20%CE%A0.\n\n\nhttps://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/41368/why-cant-dry-soil-absorb-water-well\n\n&gt;dry soil compacts\n\nFurther on this point, when your lawn becomes dry does it shrink? The answer is no, because the soil doesn't compact simply by becoming dry, it would take some sort of mechanical action ie: cars driving over earth to compact the earth. And dry earth just so happens to be much more resilient to compacting that wet earth.",

It moves faster through wet soil because they are attracted to other water molecules. Think of when you have two water droplets that join - they spring together. When the soil is wet, the soil grains are already coated in water and attract the new water to them, and act as a lubricant for the new water molecules to move across . This is, of course, before 100% saturation is reached, when the water will sit on top of the soil as well. When the soil is dry, the water isn't pulled into it. It will eventually permeate the soil but it is much much slower, as shown in the video. \n\n\n- source: I have a bachelor's degree in Hydrology and watched way too many water moving through soil experiments.",

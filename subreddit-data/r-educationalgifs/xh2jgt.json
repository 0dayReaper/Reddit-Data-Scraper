When a dataset and function have an r of 1 there is a perfect match with no error. When the value of r gets lower the dataset has more deviation from your function",

It assumes the reader/viewer knows what fuck is going on in the first place and knows what is meant by the words 'linear function'. To me this is a bunch of moving lines and dots with some numbers that change. I have no idea what they're trying to do or why. \n\nThis happens a lot to me on this sub, I think math taught in the States is a lot more advanced than is taught in most other countries.",

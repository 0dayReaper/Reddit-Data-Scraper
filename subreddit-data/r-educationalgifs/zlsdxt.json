There are varying species that survive in diverse places, like the ocean vs. in a chunk of moss, but that doesn't mean you can take the mossy fella and launch him out of a submarine. \n\nThere's also the issue that they don't so much survive in space, but rather, they can survive for a time, in a dormant state. They won't wake up and be all like \"fuckin' sweet, dude, gonna go eat me some vacuum!\"",

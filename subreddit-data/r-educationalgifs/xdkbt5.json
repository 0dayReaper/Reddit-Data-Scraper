If the numbers were a lot bigger than 12, you could try to be clever, either by capping the number of 1s in your selected set (if you never need more than 5 mushrooms, then don't try combinations of 6+), or by backtracking (keep adding mushrooms until you exceed the target weight, then remove the highest-index one and replace it with the next available...). The first approach makes it O(n^6 ), I think, and the second one would be slightly better and more flexible (but with a higher constant).",

Longer lists take longer to sort, but sorting N+1 items isn't *that* much more complex than sorting N items. The complexity goes up according to some polynomial equation - e.g., 4 + 3\\*N + N\u00b2 steps. Its order of complexity is O( N\u00b2 ) because that's the term that grows the fastest as N rises. It can be solved \"in polynomial time.\" This set of problems is called P. If a solution has polynomial complexity, it is \"in P.\"\n\nThis problem is not in P. \n\nThis problem is in fact so hard, it is in a special class of pain-in-the-ass problems. \n\nProblems where you could *check* a solution, in polynomial time, are a set of problems called NP. The N stands for \"nondeterministic,\" because why would this be simple? Problems in NP could theoretically be solved in polynomial time using a \"nondeterministic Turing machine,\" which either means guessing right the first time, or testing all possible guesses at once. Real machines cannot do this. Goddammit. So the complexity of these problems rapidly spirals out of control - taking e.g. 2^N steps. \n\nGetting as close as possible to a desired total by adding different-sized numbers is in NP. It is also in NP-Complete, which is a subset of NP where bullshit wizard math lets you convert it to or from any other problem in NP. If we find a polynomial solution to even *one* NP-Complete problem, then P = NP, mathematicians will celebrate, and cryptography as we know it will be destroyed overnight. \n\nBut for small N, you can just test every combination. This has 12 spots and I don't remember how variable combinatorial picking works so I'm just gonna point out 12-factorial is half a billion combinations. Whoop de doo.",

This has 12 spots\n\nThere are only 2^12 (ie. 4096) possible combinations, since each of the 12 mushrooms is either included or not included in making a set of acceptable weight. In reality, it's actually even less than 4096, since it's unlikely to take more than 4 mushrooms to make the set. So there are really only C(12,1) + C(12,2) + C(12,3) + C(12,4) (ie. 12 + 66 + 220 + 495 = 793) sets to test. Even if you test sets of 5 mushrooms, that only adds another 792 sets to test, for a total of 1585 sets, which is really nothing for a program.\n\nEDIT:\n\n&gt; 12-factorial\n\ndoesn't really come into play here, because it doesn't matter the order in which the mushrooms are placed in a set.",

I think its a type of online single class. they must have an acceptable range for total weight, then they shrink the problem set to 12 mushrooms and looking for the first match that's in that value range. It must be first match since it lights up before she even puts a mushroom down. if no matches, she starts swapping mushrooms.\n\nI'd be curious of the time to first match with swapping. there must be runs where there are no matches.

And visa versa if it was under weight you would just break off a small piece of the source product or find already appropriately sized pieces and add it to the bag you are selling.\n\nWell, that's pretty much what scales like this are doing, it's just been automated. This one is operated by hand, but I've seen patents for ones that have multiple conveyor belts that can weigh individual items, and selectively deliver them to different bags, so each bag ends up with close to the defined weight. The system knows \"Bag #2 need 10 more grams, item #343 is 10 grams, deliver it to bag #2 and then ship it!\"\n\nThere's even ones that do the math for minimum number of items in the bag vs. total weight of bag, so you don't get one bag with a lot of little items, and one bag with a few large items.",

Since they don\u2019t have a central nervous system, it\u2019s entirely possible that they feel less pain than broccoli.

The answer is that there is a delay on the indication of the  weight and thus more down-time to shuffle with the mushrooms.",

It looks complicated but it's very easy to use, computers do all the hard stuff behind the scenes. I use Python's PuLP package to solve linear programs, or you can use Excel's Solver add-in for simple problems. Linear programming is very flexible, you can easily add all kinds of specialized constraints to the problem (e.g. certain songs sound bad together and can't be included in the same playlist, or the playlist shouldn't include too many short songs or long songs).\n\nIn this case I'd make a binary variable x_i for each song i -- 1 if it should be included in the playlist, 0 otherwise. Each song i lasts T_i seconds. The objective is to minimize abs(sum(T_i \u00b7 x_i) - 3600), the difference between the length of the playlist and 1 hour. You'd just have to use a trick to get rid of the absolute value by adding some special constraints, since only linear functions are allowed, but there's lots of ways to do that.",

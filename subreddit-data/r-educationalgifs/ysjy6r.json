Lowering the rope into the black hole while you are \"stationary\" (by that you'd have to thrust in the opposite direction of the black hole, or at an angle if it's spinning) you would see the rope getting slower and redder, as the rope would experience extreme time dilation. This continues until the wavelength of the light lengthens until it's not visible anymore.\n\nAs for the force you'd feel, I'm not sure, but I imagine that it would get stronger and stronger until either when the rope reaches the event horizon or somewhere inside the black hole the atomic forces holding the atoms together will be ripping apart and you'd have to pull with equal force so you'd also be ripping atoms at your end if you got that far.\n\nI'm not a scientist, so correct me if I said something we know is wrong.",

It can stretch the length of galaxies, and that force gets stronger for every unit of measured distance that an affected object gets closer.\n\nLet's imagine an indestructible rope with no stretch.\n\nIf you are holding the rope yourself, and the other side of the rope is at say 100km from the event horizon, you would have to be pulling on the rope with a force equal to having the event horizon of another black hole of the same size be 100km behind you. At this point a 1kg object is subjected to around 100 billion Newtons of gravitational force.\n\nHowever, remember that the gravity well isn't just pulling on the end of the rope, like you. It's pulling on every atom of the ropes length, with different strength depending on the distance to that point of the rope.\n\nIn order to keep the rope in a balanced state, it needs equal forces pulling on it, so as the rope is approaching the event horizon, at some point (Waaaaay before even getting anywhere close to the horizon) something is going to break.\n\nEither you can't hold the rope because it starts to pull harder than you, or the anchor of the rope breaks off, or, if the rope isn't indestructible, the rope breaks at a weak point.\n\nUsing the equation for Newtons universal law of gravitation, we can approximate the distance at which you would not be strong enough to hold the rope against the force of the black hole. (Supposing there is NO other force involved)\n\nWith an average size black hole (3-10 sun masses), and the average maximum human grip strength (around 500 Newtons), you would probably reach your limit at LEAST when the rope gets around 300-500 million km from the black holes center of mass. (The event horizon for an average black hole being less than 30km from the center of mass)\n\nThat's not even taking into account the kinetic energy of a moving rope of the required length to do this. That alone would be much more than any human could hold on to. Probably more than we could possible invent an anchor for as well.",

You can make an experiment, deduce something from it, repeat the experiment with a different parameter then generalize and assume it will always work for any value of that parameter and call that a \"law\". \n\nWhen the laws of physics \"break\", it's just that we found a parameter value for which our generalization doesn't hold true. Usually it doesn't matter because it's good enough for all applications, but sometimes (typically when you go infinitely small or infinitely massive) our meso-scale laws are not predicting the observation anymore.",

I don't think you'd even realize you crossed the event horizon until you tried to accelerate away, at which point you'd find that no matter how hard you accelerate, you can't escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.  Though, if you plot the world line (kinda like the relativity version of plotting a trajectory), the time and space dimensions sort of 'switch '.  That is, just as you can only move forward in time, inside a black hole you can only move forward (that is, towards the center/singularity) in space.  This is assuming you don't immediately get ripped apart by the gravitational force of the black hole and survive for a little after crossing the event horizon.  All of which is to say, the physics are a bit strange, but not necessarily unknown or unpredictable (source: Leonard Susskind's general relativity lectures on YouTube)",

You get things that make sense mathematically based on our known equations and constants, but make no sense in practical terms. \n\nFor example, what happens when you start getting negative numbers when calculating the time something takes to occur? The math technically checks out, but it makes no intuitive sense. Stuff like that happens all the time when trying to figure out what happens inside a black hole's event horizon.",

It's all spaghettification, and has more to do with the underlying shape of spacetime more than the physical action of the body.\n\nEdit: Another post I just saw refers to Tidal Disruption Events, which this seems to depict the action of. A search reveals that these TDEs lead to the 'spaghettification' of the star, further confirming this posts title. I have learnt things today.",

It's the same phenomenon as the one you're describing, but at the scale of a star. It's actually the most common real life example shown to physics students on the topic.\n\nIt forms a ring because the star was revolving around the black hole. If you were revolving around the black home, you would also form a band around it as you spaghetified. Albeit quite a short band and quite thin too.",

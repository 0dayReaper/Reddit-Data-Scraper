Next we used a bottle of soju to poor into the shot glass, whoever makes it sink, drinks the it all.\n\nMinimum 1 drop into the shot glass when pouring and no maximum.   3 second safety period, meaning the next person to pour counts to three, if it drops within those 3 seconds, the previous person that poured drinks it.\n\n\nEdit:  Lol you guys think your so funny huh.   TYPO SHOT GLASS but will leave as is for additional laughter.",

If you add soap to water, it would already spill from the first drop because soap breaks all those hydrogen bonds. You can also easily jump flat onto water without any pain if you add some soap because there too, its the hydrogen bonds that give that surface tension that hurts.",

This can be used to tell how likely a electron will be where you\u2019re looking etc.",

It is no coincidence that post-modernism evolved during the same time period as quantum mechanics (early 20th century).\n\nDuring this time, philosophers like yourself were trying to figure out what to do with this radical new way of thinking about matter, time, and space brought about by Schrodinger, Einstein, etc. Reality had gone from being hard, solid, knowable matter into  a chaotic unknowable mess that could only be represented statistically in waveform.\n\nJust like the physicists, the most obvious conclusion for philosophers was that REALITY was not a hard, solid, knowable creation of God but rather a chaotic unknowable mess! Or as you put it, an arithmetic \"average experience of reality\" with each person being a data point.\n\nThus we get post-modernism, where subjective experience (each data point) is the source of truth. Moreover if you add all those data points up, you should see a pattern that points to a new \"ultimate truth\" which would be a direct replacement for God as the guiding light for enlightened atheist man!\n\nThe only problem is that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people have spent the last 100 years looking for this pattern and it is nowhere to be found. Lack of unified thought has only produced ever increasing isolation, depression, and a distance between people who can never agree on whose version of the truth is the ultimate reality.\n\nAs we are finding out, maybe humans were never meant to be cold machines that grind out unbiased scientific observations of sensory input to reinforce our individual notions of right and wrong. Perhaps our ancestors were not so ignorant when they decided to agree to a single, unified theory of reality and meaning as coming from God the father of creation.",

Because space itself probably also runs out of valid configurations of its fabric to support anything under a certain size.\n\nI imagine it like how an ink stain travels on a cotton sheet. If the ink isnt so dense as to bleed through the fabric, There's nowhere for it to go in between the threads so it travels along the threads.\n\nComplete blunt thoughts on the toilet so I have no idea what I'm talking about, but I guess the less you know about physics, the more you can abstract and woo away the complicated bits",

Even weirder is entanglement, where particles in isolation are defined by their own wave functions, but at soon as those particles interact they\u2019ll share the same wave function, no matter how far apart those particles are.  This means you can measure the state of one particle, and know the state of its partner particle even if it\u2019s on the other side of the universe.  More bizarrely, it\u2019s proven that the particles have no definite state until it\u2019s measured, so it\u2019s not like the particles \u201cchose\u201d their states when they interacted and maintained that state as they separated, they never had a definite state until something measured one of them. \n\nThis has very deep philosophical implications, and questions basic assumptions of locality (things can only influence other things in their immediate vicinity) and realism (things are as they are independent of you).\n\nThe Nobel prize last year was given to physicists that helped prove that \u201creality isn\u2019t locally real\u201d: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/",

Stone can be broken into fragments, blood can be dribbled in drops. \n\nAt the smallest scales, reality doesn't match that. You can't just keep breaking into smaller rocks, or smaller drops. \n\nWe've known this for a surprisingly long time. After all, wood burns, making smoke, heat and ash. So wood must be made up of 'something else'.\n\nAfter a lot of work, we've learned that, at the smallest scales, reality isn't made of stones or drops, but waves.\n\nLook at that first image. On the left is the wave. It moves, it shimmies, it's in motion - it's not a very small rock  That's the quantum mechanical reality of a wave.\n\nOn the right is something that looks a bit like a very small rock. It doesn't seem to move. It's not dynamic. It's just ... there. That's the world we perceive.\n\n And it'll behave more or less like we'd expect, unless we try to squeeze the thing into a space smaller that that bump shape. If we do that, some of the wave reality will be obvious to us.\n\nThat's how all this was worked out. At the start of the 20th century, we started building experiments that squeezed rock-like things smaller than that right hand image. And we started to see the surprise under the surface.\n\nWe call this new model of how things work quantum mechanics. And it works really, really, really well.",

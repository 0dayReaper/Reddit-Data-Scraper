You fill a hole with salt water, cover it with something that will cause it to heat up, put an empty cup in the middle with a rock on top of the cover that causes the lowest point to be the cup.  I believe you can also do it with piss, but I've heard that the water is...slightly weird tasting. \n\n\nAs it evaporates the water/steam condenses on the film/cover and rolls down into the cup.  If you can get hot coals or rocks you can do it way faster.  \n\n\nBasically you boil/evaporate salt water, collect steam and get water.  It isn't amazingly fast, but the goal is to survive, a cup of water here and there in addition to rain catchers and minimizing the amount you need from streams always helps.\n\n\nAs always, it depends on what tools you have.  You can get really weird shit if you have tubes and various other containers and glass.",

The mechanical advantage comes in when you take the tag end from the tow hook, and pass it through the initial bite that is tied up high. Bummer the video doesn\u2019t show the knot finished. You can then pull down on that tag end, creating what is effectively a 2:1 mechanical advantage. Set tension and finish with a Munter/Mule, half-hitches, or whatever you prefer down low. In this case the bite at the top not only redirects our force like a pulley, it also acts as a force multiplier.",

A sheepshank both allows you to easily control the length of rope by adjusting the distance between the two loops, which is important if you are carrying variable sized loads and thus are using a rope that will occasionally be too long for your load, and it only stays tied under load. This means that when you release the tail after cinching it down, the knot falls apart. Cinching down other knots might make them hard to untie.",

There are many choices for what knot you use for the loop and what knot you use for the hitch.

I was going to post a link but I can't find it anymore. It also put knots head to head against one another (thus the name). It would show you how to tie them, show how much pressure they could take &amp; where the pressure was, if you could slide it, and what was the knot's best uses. It had a ton of valuable information for fisherman, campers and just general use. If anyone finds the site please post it.",

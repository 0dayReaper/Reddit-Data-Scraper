            "comment": "Actually, a propagating signal/pulse can be thought of as a combination of different frequencies and wavelengths, similar to the way light can be broken down into its individual colors. This idea is fundamental to the study of wave physics and is crucial for understanding how signals travel through different mediums. It's fascinating to consider how even the smallest changes to a signal's composition can have significant impacts on its behavior and propagation.",

Make the box and circle walls as thin as possible and as perfect as possible.  Then use a diffuser system to equally distribute the particles (basically a bunch of vertical straws or tubes).  There will be some Brownian diffusion of particles as they fall, so drop over a large area so the diffusion effects only significantly influence the edge, so have the square well inside the drop zone so it sees a uniform drop pattern.",

Approximating pi is just an entry into Monte Carlo though, to show how it works in a situation where you have nice existing analogues. Once you've got the hang of it, you can use Monte Carlo simulations for all sorts of really complex problems that can't be otherwise solved, or which would far more complex to do any other way. In college we used this process to determine radiation dose rates in complex layouts, for example. We have equations and if you wanted to drive yourself mad you *might* find a way to apply them that's fairly accurate, but it's easier to throw 100,000 statistically random rays out from a source and let the computer do it's thing.",

The coordinates themselves are repeatable, you could calculate what the next location is going to be. But they're spread out in a way that over a large enough number of \"drops\" there's no bias in terms of where they'll fall. It's actually a good thing to have a statistically random but also repeatable set of data, it allows someone to verify what you've done independently. \n\nSo to answer your question more explicitly, you drop marbles randomly by calculating their next position using an algorithm known to produce statistically random data and then very carefully dropping the marble in that exact spot, repeating the process thousands of times.",

Hence, computer simulation.\n\n\nNotice how I originally said, 'it is easier to improve accuracy' and not 'Monte Carlo is more accurate'",

The cones that were there are just gone now, because people are so used to bullshit Bham roads, they've just been driving over it. Oh, and it takes up two thirds of a lane in a nearly blind, pretty busy intersection.   \n  \nEdit: I accidentally a word.\n",

Yes!)\n\nI think that a lot of manholes have more going on below grade than you see in this video where they just set the rim on the hot asphalt and vibrate it into place.   I know some are built with bricks, and then the steel/cast iron rim is set on that masonry, which contributes to them being a bit high or low relative to the roadway.  Others are based on a pre-cast concrete box below grade, but I don't know what goes up from the box... sometimes a pre-cast tube/cone?  Again, if the rim height of that structure is off, you end up with the manhole rim/lid off.",

This looks like an ad for a specific company for their frame and covers, but typically you'd only remove the asphalt if the asphalt itself has been damaged and you need to repour asphalt to seat the frame (so that shit don't move). \n\nFun fact: towards the end, the guy with the watering pot is spraying diesel, not water. makes it so the hot asphalt doesn't stick to the plate whacker.",

They have to remove the asphalt around the existing casting so they can get the old casting out and put the new casting in (sometimes they just reset the old casting). They then put in new asphalt to secure the casting thats going back in. They would have to replace the entire vertical drainage structure to put in a larger cover, as the hole at the top of the concrete drainage structure cannot be easily changed in the field, and never needs to be widened. Replacing the drainage structure would cause a much larger portion of the road to be torn out. There is zero purpose to widen them or make them larger, unless all the workers who go down to clear them all got too fat to go down. These kinds of structures collect water below, and not through the top of the structure. Though if you meant add a vertical extension when you said, \"the newer ones are larger\", then it would have made sense, but not in this case. The surface isn't new and probably not raised. The original video shows that this manhole casting was rocking/ loose. That was the reason for a new casting, but that's irrelevant. You took a shot in the dark and missed by a mile. \n\nSource: I do road design shit for work. I go out in the field at the very start of my project, and look at everything on the road, so we know what needs to be replaced. Also I get annoyed when people present their uneducated opinions as fact, but that's cool. We need more dumb sheep in this world to spread stupid opinions.",

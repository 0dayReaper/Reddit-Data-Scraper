It's probably minimal, but it distracts you when you're busy reading the rest of the content. Emphasis within the text is best in italics, emphasis for table titles can be done with just one horizontal separator, so bold isn't really a necessity and does more harm than good.\n\nI don't know if I 100% agree, but I've stopped using bold at all and I feel like the overall look of my articles is better that way. I sometimes use a little bit of bold for presentation slides though, because in that particular situation, the fact that it attracts the attention of the reader constantly while the slide is up is sometimes exactly the intended effect :)",

I also have to follow section-508 compliance on the PDFs I generate from the Word docs.\n\n* Keep the grid. It helps guide the eye.\n* Increase cell padding to create more breathing room.\n* Make the alternating color rows white with a subtle color. Use even, not odd coloring. The first non-header row should be the lighter color.\n* I prefer specific data, but I would at least use the same number of decimals for consistency.\n* Vertically center the header row. I prefer horizontally-centered header text as well, regardless of the alignment below.\n* Simplifying the first column requires merging cells or leaving blank cells, which aren't 508 compliant for the seeing impaired to navigate without creating a complex table.\n* The finished design gives no hierarchy to the header row besides a dividing line. At least bold the text.\n\nLastly, the starting table is more relaying standard data, whereas the other design is attempting to be artsy for something like an annual report. They're kind of apples to oranges imo--going out of the way to create row gaps between face, heel, and jobber, for example. I do agree with nixing Calibri though.\n\n**Edit:** Slow day.. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/zsrrC6w.jpg) my preferred take on the table--placed in the middle of the other options. I tend to center simple words, but the *Year of the...* column could go either way.\n\n**Edit 2:** Why drop calibri? It's too soft imo. The details of the font get lost at smaller sizes, and I'm not a fan of how the details get dithered/aliased/whatever it's called. This is super arbitrary though..both are terrible fonts when it comes to trying to make something look pretty, but they serve the purpose of sending standardized data that gets transferred a lot.",

If you take a standard table and remove the data in the first column then you can't sort it without everything breaking.\n\nIt would be nice if excel added some feature that would automatically remove repeated information from one row to the next and repopulate it when sorted.",

They fucking will. You need to be absolutely god damn sure that they have absolutely no excuse to lose track of what number is next to what.

You ever try to throw a grocery bag in front of you while running as fast as you can?  It doesn't work.\n\nGetting actually tangled up in your primary is pretty rare.  More likely you have too many twists in the line, or you have a line over. \n\n\n\nIf you've decided your main is unflyable, you grab both the reserve and cut handles, usually a pillow and metal ring but sometimes both are pillows.  You grab both so that you don't have trouble grabbing the other after cutting.  You \"pull, punch, release) right, then left. (and if you have the presence of mind try to hold on to the reserve pillow so you don't have to buy another one).  \n\nYou MUST do it in this order.  Having \"two out\" is real bad.  Depending on how they come out determines what you do.  But the worst case is side by side, and then you turn one away from the other.  This will cause both of them to aim down and charge you at the ground.  There are other options but they drill \"look right, grab right, look left, grab left, pull. Punch release. Pull punch release\" for a reason.\n\nReserve pilot chutes are spring loaded.  They have a mesh on the bottom side and a spring is actually inside the pilot.  When you pull the reserve the spring shoots the pilot away from you and that yanks the reserve out.\n\nReserves typically don't have sliders.  A slider is a rectangular piece of fabric that all the lines go through to slow the opening of the parachute.  You care less about a comfortable opening when you're pulling your reserve.  They're also typically a more conservative design than the main, less sporty.\n\nAnd then you have to buy your rigger (aka the person that just saved your life) a case of beer.",

Now skydivers can pack their own main parachute, but to jump at a FAA regulated drop zone a qualified rigger needs to pack the reserve parachutes and that gets documented on the parachute as well as in the rigger's own records in case of a problem later on.\n\nSkydivers are also required to receive an FAA certification based on the skills they have been able to learn and demonstrate those skills to an instructor. This is all to keep the sport safer. \n\nAll sport parachutes that are used contain one main parachute and at least one reserve parachute.",

You replied to a comment that claimed that it was to prevent a single point of failure (which it isn't preventing) and you implied this is better because a single point of failure is bad. That shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what \"single point of failure\" means. The way you're using it in your last sentence makes no sense. The ring spreads the force over itself, as do its neighbors, which lowers the shear pressure on the pull, which prevents it from sticking.  None of that has anything to do with lowering the amount of potential points of failure unless you're counting \"designing it so it doesn't fail every single time\" as \"reducing points of failure\".  Which it technically is but you know that's not what's being discussed.",

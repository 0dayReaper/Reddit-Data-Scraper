Usually 2 or more people are working together to ensure that anything that can be in danger is out of the way. If something isn\u2019t out of the way, there are emergency stop buttons that stop the lift and unlock the doors. \n\nI would assume the same safety features, or even more, like a deadman\u2019s switch, is in place here.",

                    "comment": "Only like 85% sure, but I believe it would work with a conductive, non-ferrous metal, not just copper. I felt like I understood the mechanics until I started writing this comment. But because it is conductive, the moving magnetic field creates eddy currents that would cause some resistance to the pendulum in this case.\n\nI believe this is due Lenz's Law. So copper doesn't create a strong enough magnetic interaction with by sticking a magnet to it, but when you have a magnet moving like in this case, the interaction is kind of magnified.\n\nEDIT: For anyone wanting to know more, here is the link for this video.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sENgdSF8ppA",

But that magnetic field only stops the conductor not a human inside it. So even though it looks smooth, the forces needed to stop a moving vehicle are the same. It also doesn't scale well. A small magnet and a piece of copper will repel each other nicely, but to stop a car you would need a magnet the size of a truck.",

So the better the conductor, higher the current(due to Ohm's Law), therefore stronger fields. That why you can levitate a super conductor, it can generate very high currents that oppose any change in the magnetic field, and lock itself in place.",

A perfect conductor, should one exist, would not exhibit the locking effect seen in a superconductor, instead it would look much like the experiment above, namely the conductor would fall until it reached a speed where its change in magnetic flux produces a force equal to the acceleration of gravity. The speed would be lower the lower your resistance is, but the number would be non-zero.\n\nA superconductor is different. It *rejects* the magnetic field around it, which essentially creates a little magnetic bottle for itself. This alone wouldn't explain the locking effect, but they make those superconducting discs in such a way that there are holes in the superconducting materical, called \"flux pinning holes\" that mean [essentially the magnetic lines hold the superconductor up like its on a string.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Flux_Pinning_Field_Diagram.jpg) This is also what allows the superconductor to be arbitrarily reoriented.",

If you get the 7th most powerful electromagnet to ever run on the planet, you can levitate a frog, or a strawberry, using only the naturally diamagnetic properties of their water:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlJsVqc0ywM",

Often it can tell you more then your gauges. \n\nA portable oxy acetylene rig with a brazing tip will let you braze joints in tight places, and make small repairs to coils. It's not as cheap and easy as a turbo torch, but much more precise.\n\nIf your going into commercial service work, stay hydrated and don't skip upper day! There's almost never any shade on rooftops and a 32 foot ladder weighs around 80 pounds.\n\nHonestly the multimeter is the big thing. Be proficient at ohming motors and checking amp draw. Feel free to dm any specific questions, and best of luck.",

In my experience doing commercial work for the past 20 years HVAC pays better, but electrical work can be less physically demanding. Honestly is say it comes down to which trade feels like a better fit for you. They both are safe trades that aren't going anywhere.\n\nI got licensed in both bc a lot of service company's offer both electrical and mechanical services. That kept me busy and at the top of the technician pay scale.\n\nSorry if I'm not really answering your question",

That current generates it's own magnetic field (how an electromagnet works). In a situation where magnetic field A induces a current in a conductor which then creates magnetic field B, magnetic fields A &amp; B are in opposite directions. The closer the conductor is to a superconductor, the closer in scale magnetic field B will be to magnetic field A.\n\nSo in the gif:\n\n- The magnet swings toward the copper puck.\n- Copper is a good conductor so the moving magnet induces a current in it.\n- The current inside the copper puck creates a magnetic field opposite to the swinging magnet's\n- Copper being a very good conductor means that the generated magnetic field is close in magnitude to the magnets'.\n- The generated field slows/stops the magnet.",

Now, I could be EXTREMELY wrong about all of this and someone could GLADLY prove me wrong, but brakes in cars are used by pressing kevlar on either side of the brake disc, right? That creates heat in itself, and the heat warps and runs down your Kevlar pretty badly, especially the harder you are on your brakes. The heat is always pinpointed to the contact of where the Kevlar touches the brake disc. \n\nBut what if you used magnetic brakes??? The magnets in this video seem to show that the heat is then distributed broader throughout the disc, which would mean less wear and tear on your brake disc in your car, and less chance of it possibly breaking, as well as the fact that there\u2019s no friction on your magnets, which means no tear on them as well. Wouldn\u2019t that be a safer option to use for cars? As well as it would save people money on brake discs AND brake pads?",

That means, the faster the conductor is moving relative to the magnet, the more current that results.  More current leads to more braking force.  The problem is that near zero speed, there will be nearly no magnet movement relative to the conductor, so no braking force.\n\nIf you want to be able to come to a complete stop, you'd need a second set of brakes that works at low speed.  That's added cost and complexity for no real benefit.\n\nHaving said that, most electric cars use regenerative braking.  They use the electric motors as generators when the car is braking.  They charge your battery when you brake.  But, they also have conventional brakes, because you can't really do without those.  Because an electric generator and a motor are the same thing, they didn't have to add any special things to the wheels to enable this option, just to know if you're trying to create movement from electricity (motor, accelerating) or create electricity from movement (generator, braking).",

Older cars were sturdier than today's cars. Get into an accident today in a 2020 Chevy. Car gets destroyed and you walk away with a sprained ankle. Get into the same accident in a Chevy from the early 60's. The car holds up way better, but you end up with a concussion, whiplash, sprained neck, lower back injury etc. When the vehicle doesn't absorb the impact, all that energy gets transferred to your body and everything else inside the car",

You can rent a little tiny low HP boat to go out to some nearby uninhabited islands for an explore, it's pretty cute and romantic etc.\n\nProblem is you have to cross the main shipping channel to Hvar Harbour to get there. I mean we're talking some pretty big cruise liners and Jadrolinija ferries and we're in something about the size of two large kayaks strapped together.\n\nYou have to potter through the harbour at low revs and then crank the engine up to max to get through the shipping lane and its open currents as quick as possible. Problem is, the person who's had our boat before us has partly flooded the engine and we don't really know this until I hit top speed and it cuts out.\n\nSo there's me and my girlfriend in this busy shipping channel just drifting and the backwash of every vessel narrowly missing us is practically flipping this tiny thing massively back and forth in these huge, terrifying rolls and every one feels like its going to capsize us.\n\nLater on (thanks to some unrelated anchor issues) I realised the boat was comfortably light enough for me to jump in and pull it whilst swimming which probably would have helped but at the time, not gonna lie, it was about the most terrified I've been in the last decade.",

Getting pushed from behind and turned (yawing) while going down the wave is the last place you want to be on the water.\n\nEdit: if waves of any real size are coming from behind your boat you need to make sure you are traveling the same speed or a little bit faster than them. If you can't; then you can't go in that direction and you need to change your plan.  Boats get capsized in seconds when they get caught from the stern by big waves.",

Length of ship and frequency of wave can lead to some really interesting and dangerous shit. Same speed if the wavelength is the same as your ship length can get you caught on top of or in a trough of a wave which isn't good. Any speed to break the frequency alignment is OK. Also depends on wave steepness whether you get overtaken and ride them with steerage intact, or if you get waves crashing over the back which is amusingly called pooping.",

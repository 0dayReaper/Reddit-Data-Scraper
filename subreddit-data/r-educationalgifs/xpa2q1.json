I don't think Target and Walmart are incredible employers, but I'm pretty sure they're better than Amazon. I feel the same way about my local substantiation of the national grocery store chain i shop at.  Maybe they aren't owned &amp; run by Mom &amp; Pop, but they also aren't threatening people with their job if they don't work through the hurricane ravaging the town. \n\nIf Amazon didn't exist and Target was the big evil retail giant, if probably be preaching about supporting other small, non-Target retailers. And those retailers would probably exist. I don't think I can't make our society magically revert to that period of our history. But I am a bit more morally comfortable in avoiding Amazon's distribution chain as much as I am able.  \n\n(Yes, I know about AWS.  If you know of a way I can avoid supporting them, let me know. But even if I don't think it's possible to do that, I can still do my best to avoid purchasing hard goods from Amazon)\n\n(Yes, I'm also aware that many small mom &amp; pop producers use Amazing distribution network to thrive in the retail environment. I understand why they do so. I also try to do as much of my shopping at local B&amp;M stores as possible.  Can't win every battle).",

The risk goes up with both the amount of asbestos and the duration of exposure\nBut exposures are cumulative in the sense that asbestos fibers will remain in the body from each exposure, and any embedded fiber might cause the disease at a later date. \n\nThere's obviously plenty of data out there, and some studies are more skeptical than others as to the risk of brief exposures. But I've seen enough mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer to be worried about the consequences of asbestos-related disease. And I've deposed enough doctors to be wary of any asbestos exposure.",

You\u2019re mistaking OTCs with dietary supplements.\n\nOver the counter drugs have to follow the same FDA and USP regulations and guidelines as any other drug or cosmetic under Title 21 Code of Federal Regulation (21 CFR subchapter C).\n\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-C\n\nDietary supplements were designated as a food category in 1994 under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. \nhttps://ods.od.nih.gov/About/DSHEA_Wording.aspx\n\nBasically, right or wrong, dietary supplements are seen as food that poses no more possible risk to humans than chicken nuggets.  Therefore, they just have to follow the clean production rules that food does.  This is why a dietary supplement can make vague health claims while saying that the FDA has not evaluated claims of helping health.  It\u2019s a roundabout way of saying \u201cthis product helps your health but it doesn\u2019t and we have no proof or FDA backing to prove it.\u201d  They have to clearly state that they aren\u2019t making a claim that would make them a drug.\n\nOTC drugs are\u2026 drugs.  They\u2019re assumed to be a dangerous until proven otherwise and cleared by FDA.\n\nDoes the difference seem vague?  That\u2019s because it is.\n\nCheerios claims to lower cholesterol.  Until 2009, they claimed that it would lower cholesterol by 4% in 6 weeks.  FDA determined that the percentage over time claim was a drug claim and cited General Mills.  To this day, General Mills claims that Cheerios lower cholesterol but they removed the percentage over time claim to stay on the non-drug side of the line.\n\nThe line is that grey but it\u2019s a line that, if you produce dietary supplements or food, you sure as hell don\u2019t want to cross.  FDA will ruin your business and life for fucking around.  It\u2019s very much a fuck-around-and-find-out kind of thing.",

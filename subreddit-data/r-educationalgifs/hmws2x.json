Providing more paths of electrical flow won't do anything since the motor, not the controls, are the ultimate limiter in these simple circuits.\n\nObviously, one should still not try to bypass this as OP is not wrong, there ARE motor circuits out there where you absolutely cannot connect the motor directly.",

Otherwise you have to use a different motor that compensates for wanting to start on low speed (pricier). If you just crank the engine to max for a turn it'll have all the momentum it needs with a far crappier motor.\n\nEdit: or maybe a logic controller that forces it to start max for a bit, but now you've added a chip board to the fan",

When you press 3 it connects one resistor in the circuit. When you press 2 it now has two resistors on either side, one running back to the line and one direction running to the fan. When you press 1 there is now 3 resistors to the fan and only 1 running back to the line. Or maybe they do it with a voltage divider instead, but the same setup would work, just the wiring is different. That would work for dials too because then it would just be a simple potentiometer.",

So if you have the 3 speed button depressed, the bar has shifted too far to the left for the 1 speed button to notch in.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I'm sure this is the case. If you ever had or still have a device with these types of switches, you can probably recall the feeling of pressing the 1 speed button while the 3 speed button is engaged-- it doesn't want to depress at all, because it is hitting the very top of the bar. One device that still relies on this type of switch that comes to mind are blenders-- ever notice how you can't switch between some of the settings?\n\nSo in the most simple design as shown in this video, you have to turn the fan OFF before you can go back down to lower speeds. You can only go up speeds without turning it off.",

If I fan doesn't get enough torque to start, all of the power turns into heat which can cause the fan motor to overheat and (potentially) catch on fire.\n\nI had a fan which saw very heavy use get jammed from too much dust in the mechanism (cheap fan couldn't be opened for cleaning). One day I turned it on and it jammed up and couldn't spin, but I didn't notice. It started to overheat, then progressed to melting its encasement before my roommates noticed the burning smell and intervened.",

Alien stranded on earth, looking to recover some alien technology. Finds it but it doesn't work properly. The human tells him to fix it, and he basically says something like \"I'm just a regular guy on my planet I have no idea how the technology works!\".\n\nI don't know why it always stuck with me, but it pops in my head constantly. Especially with things like this when the solution is always so much simpler than I would have imagined.",

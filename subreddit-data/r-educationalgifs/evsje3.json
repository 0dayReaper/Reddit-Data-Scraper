Especially since the caramel macchiato has the vanilla syrup in it and people would be all \u201ccan you make me an iced caramel macchiato but with vanilla syrup and stir it? Is that extra?\u201d No lady. It\u2019s technically cheaper, but if I ring it up the way that makes it cheaper you\u2019re going to yell at me for not putting it in right, and I just am not having that conversation again. \n\nFucking... much rant.

I put in my 40 hours and that's that. \n\nYou'll get through college! Don't explode your heart doing dumb shit like I did.

So to tag on...\n\nThe steam wand and power definitely matter but cheap ones can work on some machines. I originally learned on a Delonghi Dedica. The main focus is to have the tip of the steam wand just below the surface so that the natural rolling of the milk makes the surface dip above and below the wand tip continuously. This is where the chirping sound comes from. To get the starting position, I like to put the wand just slightly off center and then tilt the pitcher a bit at an angle. The exact starting position isn't super critical. Another note for cheap (weak) steamers specifically, it takes a few seconds for the milk to start rolling so try not to be impatient by moving the pitcher a lot right at the beginning.\n\nWith weak steam wands, usually the fewer holes the better. On cheap machines the steam wand is often a panarello, so hopefully you can detach that. Some of them work well enough but they all work a little differently and my above advice may not apply to those.\n\nWhich machine do you have?",

I bought a very small 12oz pitcher that way just barely short enough to reach the milk. If you can't find a pitcher small enough for your needs, the other workaround to use in conjunction is to tilt the pitcher very severely. Your steam wand will actually be aiming more towards the wall at this point and it takes a lot of practice to be able to froth at this weird angle but it might be possible for you!  \n\n\nIn any case good luck and happy frothing :)",

The consistency of the milk is another point of difference between a flat white and a latte \u2013 a latte has a creamy, velvety layer of milk on the surface which can vary in depth depending on where you buy your coffee.

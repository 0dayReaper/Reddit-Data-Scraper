You can separate it to \"full\" induction or regular, because sometimes it fails miserably when you do it completely for each and every scenario, but it can seem \"correct\" if you don't. (For instance, a very popular exercise- prove all horses are the same color. ofc it's wrong, but if you skip steps...)",

This is proving the contrapositive of a statement like\n\"If P then Q\" which would be \"if not Q, then not P\"\nIt rained so the road is wet.\nThe road isn't wet, so it didn't rain. \n\n\nAnd there's induction as well, which is also neato. It's all pretty neato, if you ask me.",

You may argue it hasn't been formalized into some axiomatic system. I would respond that any such system would be designed to accommodate this argument rather than the other way around, so what's the point? Mathematics is about ideas, not symbol-pushing.\n\nFormal proofs in my mind are mostly useful when the ideas are so involved or abstract that you're bound to make mistakes without the formality. Formalisms can also help communicate complicated ideas to others. The argument in the picture needs no such help.\n\nI should perhaps be clear that if I encountered this argument while teaching an intro to proofs class, I would not call it a proof in front of the class. But that's because most of my students are pretty bad at logic and are very bad at communicating their mathematical ideas, so they need to think proofs are formal since they constantly need the extra structure.",

That's only true for convex polygons. (In some sense that's the *definition* of that class of shapes.) I don't think that's a humongous problem--you could just restrict the proof to that class of polygons. \n\nMore seriously, to me, the inward motion isn't uniform for all of the points on the polygon. If you look closely at the OP some points on all of the polygons don't move in a straight line--they turn abruptly once the polygon reaches zero area. I don't think this gif, by itself, proves that there's always only two stages to the collapsing. I'd be worried that, for polygons stretched far enough in one direction, the area reaches zero too soon and it doesn't work. I think a full proof will need a lot more detail about that. \n\nMaybe there is a purely visual proof that can provide that detail. But I don't think the OP is that.",

When you get to another corner, you have to rotate your body by a certain angle to follow the next line. That's the external angle. Use the gif to try to visualize this.\n\nSince you're going around a shape, then when you come back to your starting point, your body would have made a full turn, which is 360 degrees.\n\nIn the case on a concave shape, when you turn counterclockwise at a corner, the angle should be positive. However, when you turn clockwise, you could count that angle as negative. Then in that case, the external angles will sum to 360.",

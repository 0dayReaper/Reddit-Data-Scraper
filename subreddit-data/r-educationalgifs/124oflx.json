I really hope we find a different material that does the same job while not lasting 500 years after the fact. Until then we can probably try to decrease our plastic consumption by properly incentivising changes in consumer habits + supply chain.\n\nBut without plastic packaging we would have way less food diversity available and/or just less food in general. So it's not like we do this just to be assholes.\n\nAnyways, the copypasta:\n\n&gt;Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok\u00e9mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok\u00e9mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3\u201d03\u2019 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they\u2019re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more",

A pineapple is not an accessible fruit for anyone who doesn't have the mobility, strength, or dexterity to be able to safely wield a knife. It's also why grocery stores sell silly-seeming things like plastic cups with de-shelled hardboiled eggs inside, packages of pre-peeled orange segments, jars of minced garlic, and pre-cut packs of cleaned and peeled veggies like carrots, celery, squash, peppers, etc. It saves an abled person 5min on cooking prep time, but it makes it possible for disabled folks to independently use those foods *at all*.  I do agree that we produce more plastic waste than is safe, but there are other, better places to cut down.",

We don\u2019t. The market for people that need a product like this is very small. I\u2019m not denying it exists, but this level of production is not justified. This level of production is required for mass market adoption - where it is not needed, but used for convenience, at the expense of the environment. A high schooler chopping fruit is a more appropriately sized scale for the limited disabled market - probably get a fresher product as well. Per unit, yes, small scale choppers most likely use more plastic. But for all product, not even close. This is a solution in search of a problem that is highly destructive. And not just in the direct plastic. Think about the logistics of processing and moving that product around - instead of going straight from the airport or dock to a DC and then store, the fruit must go to a processing plant, where workers that drive to that processing do the work. Then it needs to be refrigerated to the DC and then to market. The carbon footprint of food is heavily tipped towards the last mile - the boat is extremely efficient, the trucks not so much. Limiting truck time is critical to a comprehensive carbon reduction plan. \n\nEquity is ideal. I just think we need to really understand the problem we are trying to solve and not rely on late stage capitalism to give us the answer.",

Nobody\u2019s going to eat just one pineapple spear (because people only eat a ton of pineapple and don\u2019t mix it with different fruit or only want a small snack). Individual packs will stay fresh longer with less waste than if you ate a few pieces from a large portion of fruit that\u2019s now going bad because it\u2019s opened. \n\nLike those bags of sliced apples stay fresh and actually get eaten. \n\nThe packaging definitely should be more biodegradable, but there\u2019s less waste when produce is prepared like this in large facilities. The fruit is taken from the farm to the plant and is packaged then transported to stores. Instead of the fresh whole pineapples being transported all over the world when about 1/4 weight isn\u2019t even edible and will have to be thrown out. The stores have to deal with cutting the pineapple up or watching it rot because people don\u2019t want to deal with a whole pineapple. \n\nEvery store in every town in the US cutting their pineapple up and dealing with the waste is going to have a much bigger environmental impact than a pineapple company having all their pineapple processed at their facilities. The facilities probably have a earth friendly way to deal with the waste, too. Compost or animal feed. Something all grocery stores aren\u2019t going to deal with.",

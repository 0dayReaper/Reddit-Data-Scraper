I wonder if people that use this tool predominately every develop the ability to draw free hand or whether they\u2019re utterly dependent on the tool.  I was eventually able to move into drawing subjects or scenes based on that skillset i had built basically copying without tracing.",

Then she holds it up and there's my hand drawing of The Hungry Caterpillar against all of the nice and neat traced drawings, saying \"This is the only one who knew to follow the rules!\". And I'm sitting there with just a blank look on my face because she was basically saying mine was too shitty to be a tracing. At the time, I didn't even know what a tracing was lol",

The details and mistakes that could \"only\" come from a lens are also plausibly deliberate artistic techniques.  Among the problems for Hockney's idea are the fact that photorealistic paintings predate the development of lenses of any kind of optical quality, myriad instances of faulty analysis from a physics perspective, and the curricula from art studios of the time which led students to develop the ability to paint photorealistic portraits without lenses (techniques which are still used by some current portraiture schools).   \n\n\nI don't doubt that the camera obscura and camera lucida and other optical tools were employed by artists, but the claim that such things constituted their only or even primary technique isn't really supported by evidence.",

But Tim believes that anyone could've been a vermeer, however there is a lot of artistry and thought put behind his paintings that not everyone could do. His ingenious use of color contrast/harmony, line weight/variance, and composition, to name a few, all lend to this overwhelming affect of light in his paintings. This cannot be achieved by just copying what you see because that won't translate well to a 2d surface. Vermeer had to decide what to leave out and what to accentuate in order to capture something true to the eye on a 2d plane.\n\nEdit: some grammar things",

Some off the top of my head:\n\n* In the old days before Google Images they would have filing cabinets full of photos cut out of magazines and books, so that when, for example, they had to draw a scene inside an airport lounge they could get the Airport Lounge Folder out and copy from the photos.\n\n* There's a special very expensive artist's book (I forget the name) full of thousands of pictures of different facial expressions, so that if you have to draw, say, a surprised old man then you have a picture to copy the face from.\n\n* They use projectors and light boxes to trace images, mostly their own, but they often trace things from reference material and other artist's comic books to save time.\n\n* There's this strange plastic tool called an [Ames Lettering Guide](https://i.imgur.com/KZoU3OZ.jpg) that cartoonists use to draw guidelines for their lettering.\n\n* A special paper called DuoShade where you use different chemicals to get both black and grey-toned lines into your drawing.\n\n* Zip-A-Tone sheets that you carefully cut out with an X-acto knife and place into your comic panel to get that special dot shading that you see so often in comics.",

Once you master it, you dont need to prove you can draw to anyone, so then you seek shortcuts to get to the final image, which is the whole point of what the viewers see, not the process, especially if its an under drawing to a painting. It would be silly for me to free hand trace a complex scene over a week when in 3 hours I could project a photograph of it and trace. Its also important to note that the tracing a good drawing does not make, line quality, shading, composition, etc are all done after the fact and are 99% of it.",

Then will print my final sketch and use transfer paper to cut down on time getting my light sketch onto the paper before painting. \n\nI can do all these things without these tools but they save time, which means I can be more productive and spend more time painting.",

Knowing what contours to trace and what to leave alone is a skill artists learn over time. Shading, colouring, etc. all require learned techniques. \n\nProfessional artists often trace because they're working on a production schedule (so to speak) and, in their view, the artistry is in the details, just like you mention. I'm not always sure I agree, but many historically 'significant' works of art were composed using tracing techniques and it's undeniably a tool in the artist's toolkit.",

The basic optics were described 200 years earlier by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in his Dioptrice (1611), but there is no evidence he or his contemporaries constructed a working camera lucida. By the 19th century, Kepler's description had fallen into oblivion, so Wollaston's claim was never challenged.",

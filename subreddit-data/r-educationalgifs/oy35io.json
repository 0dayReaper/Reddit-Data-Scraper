The first however many die attempting to penetrate the egg wall and enter the egg. Eventually the wall is weakened and one of the last remaining sperm cells \"swims\" inside. This is why the idea of you being born from the fastest sperm is wrong, the fastest sperm probably went *bonk* into the egg wall and died, while one of the slower ones waited for the wall to be broken and entered.\n\nIf they left the sperm outside the wall it most likely would have died trying to enter. This way they ensure that the sperm gets in there and if all goes well, the sperm will fertilise the egg and you have a baby on the way. If the sperm isn't active enough or something else is wrong, they'll have to do this again.",

You control the needle with a joystick on one hand and a dial to push out the liquid in the needle while looking down a microscope. The needle is held in 3 dimensions and can move as such, but those dimensions are in micrometers. Someone walking nearby can move it. Most people think of cells and bacteria as these flat roundish things but they are actually like footballs and squishy bags in 3D. They also move around, up and down either due to water currents or by swimming. So you're hunting them with this microscopic needle and trying to spear them but the closer you get, the needle tends to push them away. You need a license (I think) to own a micromanipulator in the US because of its use in IVF.",

Not every species has X/Y chromosomes and there are pretty much no characteristics that can be used to distinguish \u201cmale\u201d from \u201cfemale\u201d that apply to every species. So in terms of biological sex, \u201cmale\u201d is arbitrarily defined as the sex in the species with smaller gamete and \u201cfemale\u201d is defined as the sex in the species with the larger gamete.",

This doesn\u2019t guarantee that an embryo will result in a successful birth nor mutate later on but it does make the odds better. \n\nThey take the cells from the part of the embryo that becomes the placenta.

Does it hurt? Cost? Are my kids really mine? Will they be mentally deficient? I\u2019m serious - You name it, I\u2019ve heard it. If you\u2019re thinking about it and have questions, reach out and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them candidly. Our experience in IVF for both kids was exceptional. \n\nTo answer some basic questions: They\u2019re 10 and 6 now. Both are considered high-ability in school, blonde hair and blue eyes (thanks for the contributions, wifey), well-mannered and energetic like all kids that age. They are absolutely the best part of world.",

At roughly every step in the of traditional IVF process without ICSI, on average, a tremendous amount is lost. So you have however many follicles, but not every one will yield a mature egg. And when the mature eggs are retrieved, not all will fertilize. And out of the fertilized eggs, not all make it to a day 5 blastocyst. And the ones that do, if you want them to be genetically tested, not all will be genetically normal. And not every embryo survives the thaw after genetic testing for embryo transfer. \n\nGenerally speaking, the people who do ICSI have male factor infertility, so ICSI tends to yield more embryos than if the people did traditional IVF. \n\nThey have not found any significant differences in peer reviewed studies really with ICSI babies if I recall correctly.",

Normal IVF multiple sperms and eggs are just \"introduced\" in the lab and allowed to more or less naturally do their thang, which involves the sperm drilling through the outer layers of the egg until there's a winner. ICSI increases fertilisation rates, especially when the sperm are low quality and not doing a good job of burrowing into the egg. So it is actually helpful not harmful.",

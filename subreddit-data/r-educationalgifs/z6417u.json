It's subzero so half the customers are already wearing balaclavas or scarves, gloves, and sunglasses anyway, so, you know, no prints, no face, no case. And I would have loved to see cops attempt to chase a snowmobile that can dart in and out of alleys and across a frozen fucking river to the next town over (we lived on an island and the river around us froze over), right on the border of Canada. I mean halfway across the west river and you're technically in Canada. I can just imagine them scratching their heads now. 20 degrees in any direction and you're in a different town or even a different country. They'd spend an hour just figuring out what town I went to and what jurisdiction to call. It would have been the perfect crime.\n\nOf course I didn't do it but it would have been sweet.",

If you freeze water in an insulated container (like igloo coolers, or an insulated cup) you freeze the water from one side, instead of all sides. So, the impurities get pushed to one side as the water freezes, and that's where the unclear ice is.\n\nThis means that the unclear part of the ice is what freezes last. If you just partially freeze the water, you can pull your block of ice out of the cooler and the be left with only unclear ice, as the impurities in the water haven't been frozen yet. Saves you the effort of having to cut the unclear ice off.",

Most will have camp stoves to keep things warm, and fancier ones may have a cooktop setup and bunks. It's not uncommon to see people who retrofit old camper trailers into ice shacks as well. I know guys that spend entire weekends out on the lake.\n\nWhen I go, I usually take a small pop up tent sort of set up with me, as I don't get the chance to fish enough to make a more permanent shack worth it. We'll absolutely keep our catch if it's a legal size (we usually target walleye). Some people have set-ups to cook fish in their shacks. I'll typically fillet the fish and throw the fillets in a cooler to take home at the end of the day, along with the rest of our gear.",

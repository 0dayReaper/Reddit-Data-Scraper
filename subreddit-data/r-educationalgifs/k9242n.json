For example the basic working principles of the atomic bomb can now be looked up on Wikipedia and we know it works. But the people in the Manhattan Project had none of that, for all they know those ideas resulted in utter catastrophic uselessness so they had to proceed very carefully testing out each assumption. Knowing which of infinite possibilities is more or less \"right\" is a huuuuge time saver even if the details are shoddy. (China and Russia copying American stuff is also a great example of this. It's often not exactly the same, but it fundamentally works even if all the parts have to be redone in metric.)",

That energy can be turned into other forms of energy. Like using a waterfall to turn a wheel to power a generator. (kinetic to electric).\n\nThe way energy, movement and mass are all related was figured out by Newton, and the equation that governs them is E = 0.5 \\* m \\* v^2 where m is mass, and v is velocity.\n\nThis all works fine and dandy until the early 20th century when we discovered that the speed of light is always the same. It doesn't matter if you measure a lightbulb sitting on a lab table, the light of a distant star, or the light of that same star 6 months later (When the earth is moving in the opposite direction relative to the star). In every direction, and no matter how fast either you, or the object you are looking at moves, you always measure the exact same speed.\n\nThis was a big problem. For example, suppose you are sitting on a train that moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light. You shine a light up and measure how long it takes to hit the ceiling. Someone besides the track looks into your cabin and also measures how long that takes. From your perspective, the light goes straight up and you measure that it takes light 1 second to reach the ceiling. You can then figure out the speed of light by dividing the length the light has travelled (as in, the height of the ceiling) by that 1 second.\n\nFrom the perspective of the guy next to the tracks though, the light is NOT moving straight up. It is moving at an angle. Since the train is moving fast, the light needs to move at an angle to hit the ceiling of your train. This means that from the perspective of the guy besides the rails, the light travels a longer distance. And if everyone always measures the exact same speed of light, that means the guy besides the track needs to measure a longer time than you did. So you can both do the same measurement, on the same lightbeam and still disagree on how long it took.\n\nEinstein solved this with special Relativity. Which says that as someone goes faster, time slows down for them. That's why you measure a shorter time than the guy besides the tracks, time was moving slower for you.\n\nAnd since velocity is a measure of both distance and time, and time is relative, that means we need to adjust Newton's simple formula. Once you do a whole lot of maths to account for that time dilation, you figure out that the actual formula is:\n\nE = m \\* c^2 \\* sqrt(1+((sqrt(m^2 \\* v^2 / (1 - (v/c)^2 ))/(m\\*c))^2)\n\nWhich is quite a mess. But, you'll note that if v = 0, in other words, the object is not moving, the entire thing ends up simplifying to E = mc^2. Which was quite a surprise and neatly solved a couple of other big problems in physics, like how the sun still has enough energy to keep shining after billions of years.",

Like shit...even Plato and Franklin just were willing to let the imagination run wild on already current inventions. \n\nLike tell me you have never seen a mill where some old lady is spinning a wheel with a peddle \n(That was the popular machine before this)\nand some how sowing some shit. It\u2019s like churning butter, like yeah this shit was closest to a computer with the punch cards....mad props....but it\u2019s not like we were still doing this by hand before he came along\n\nEdit: fucking cheers bro. Your not dumb at all, it\u2019s just a out dated technology which can seem complicated without the full history!!\n\nFor example, If you have never seen a car before; the idea of a engine would be mind blowing, but show the same gif to someone our age, and they can at least explain the idea/physics of it. Same shit. This was work done by the poor man, same as breaking rocks (maybe a better example would be phone operator). It just seems more complex than it is because of the complete lack of concept, not intelligence.",

These inventors get an idea, usually like in this case a way to improve upon something that already exists, meaning like this guy didn't invent the process of weaving or how threads are rather actually woven to form patterns but just wanted a way to make it more efficient. Once he had his idea he very well could have spent 8, 10, 12 or hours more each day for years on this one singular idea. Yes, people that make momentous Innovations and inventions are brilliant but they don't pull these things out of thin air in a day.\n\nEdit: one additional thing... Two important reasons many historical inventors have been wealthy are because not just does wealth allow for education which is obviously hugely important, but more importantly being independently or previously wealthy allows these people to be able to pursue these inventions instead of having to make a living for themselves and possibly a family which provides an absolute ton of extra time.",

Someone was commenting on how you could use knit and perl knitting to encode Doom in 0s and 1s on a blanket. I think they calculated that a team of 100 grannies could probably knit Doom in about a year or so. \n\nBut it went into the interesting history of looms and punch cards, and how she why punch cards became the standard for early computer programming, as well as some interesting tidbits about how a team of little old ladies had to hand stitch the Apollo astronaut suits to very specific standards without any errors. It was fascinating stuff-- who knew that textiles and computers were so closely related? I certainly didn't! It was neat to learn about stuff I'd never considered that the Apollo missions had to account for, and the overlooked people who put human beings on the moon.",

In the case of a shuttle there appear to be chutes on either side that literally catch and slap the shuttle back and forth. The shuttle carries its own bobbin so they have methods of automatically replacing them, too. But there are other types that don't use shuttles at all...   \n&amp;nbsp;  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0W0iDj7_hc  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThe rapier, airjet, and projectile methods are pretty fucking wild.",

So when the shuttle is from one end to another, then the shuttle is gliding on top of the bottom row of strings while still being on the track below the strings.\n\nThe machine can then shift the threads and repeat the process from the other end without having the track in between the threads.\n\nI feel pretty stupid as it is a simple solution.",

In fact, there\u2019s no evidence that any sabots were ever tossed into any machinery.\n\n[...] \n\n&gt;In their report, the two anarchists recommended that French labor unions adopt a policy of work slowdowns and inefficiencies that had been used successfully by British trade unionists.\n\n&gt;This policy was popularly known in Britain as Ca\u2019 Canny, a Scottish colloquialism that Spargo translates as \u201cgo slow\u201d or \u201cbe careful not to do too much.\u201d\n\n[...] \n\n&gt;\u201cThe idea is obvious: the peasant with heavy wooden shoes walks clumsily and slowly in company with those who wear shoes of leather,\u201d he writes. \u201cSo the word \u2018sabotage\u2019\u2014literally \u2018wooden shoeage\u2019\u2014was coined \u2026 as a good translation of the British term Ca\u2019 Canny.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2010/09/sabotage.html",

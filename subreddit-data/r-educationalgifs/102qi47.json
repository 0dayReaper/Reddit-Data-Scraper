Everyone thought the land would be sold very quickly, but no one wanted it.\n\n Turns out it was 50-60+ year old gas station and removing the fuel tanks, and the fear of discovering any contaminants made it too much of a financial sinkhole. So, a decade later, it is still vacant.\n\n Looks so odd with the open flat concrete, no structures anymore, just the few platforms the fuel pumps sat on.",

Its always the lower performing, less desirable locations. So they can get out of their bad locations that they know nobody would ever buy.",

It significantly reduces the number of pumps that are required to be purchased and maintained. Instead of two per dispenser you have two total. In addition, especially in warmer climates, suction systems can vaporize gasoline between the tank and pump, which isn't a good thing. You're limited in how far you can run the lines with a suction system as well, which isn't great because it means your tanks have to be close to the dispensers and the tanker often gets in the way of business while filling the tanks. Suction systems used to be more common, but new installations have primarily been submersible pump systems for decades now.",

Heat is also hardly a factor since the pipes are buried and therefore very well insulated from the heat.\n\nPreference in my field of work has always been to keep the dispense Bowser as a self contained unit, but good to know different countries/clients may have different preferences/requirements.\n\nEdit: added \"lengths\" to \"massive pipe lengths\".",

The state demanded that a potential buyer pay for the cleanup, which would have cost ten times more than the property itself, before they would let anyone open another non-gas station business there.  As far as I know, the site has remained vacant for 20 years because the city/county/state won't do the cleanup.",

Sometimes you get the call about a big chungus that's pushing [50,000 gallons of heating oil](https://ibb.co/NF6f2N4)\n\nIn terms of seismic hazards, because they are most typically buried in the ground, they don't necessarily *feel* the same intensity as we do on the surface.  Yes there is a risk just based on the amount of energy imparted during a large quake but USTs aren't specifically protected against seismicity.\n\nThe largest, most common threat is from corrosion (if the tanks are older and still made of metal) of the tanks and piping system.  There is an entire industry devoted to cathodic protection of buried infrastructure to that USTs don't end up [looking like this after 50 years in the ground.](https://ibb.co/mSsk88z)",

The light travelled for 30million years before hitting the telescope's lens and giving us this image. To address your other query, the further we are from something the harder it is to see for multiple reasons one of which is that it simply isn't going to be nearly as 'bright'; the number of photons *light particles* will have dispersed further. \n\nYou may have heard that time changes depending on how fast you are going and that light does not experience time thus confusing you. Indeed from the light's perspective it was simultaneously emitted from that galaxy, and received at the lens because things travelling at the cosmic speed limit (commonly referred to as the speed of light because light travels at that speed) experience no time, however from our perspective it is 30million years old. If there was some intelligent being staring at us through a lens it would not be seeing us, but Earth 30million years ago, devoid of human civilization, but still green and blue with a bunch of whatever flora and fauna were prevalent at the time if they had sufficient resolution.",

Basically engineers decide how hard and in what direction a specific shape needs to travel to bend the wire. So you can change all the heads and forms, and change the angle and amount of actuation, and the amount of force it puts out, all within the specs of the machine of course. You change these setting by either manually turning screws and switching parts or by inputting at some sort of panel. Sometimes an electrician needs to re-wire the electronics to change the settings. The trade that keeps these running is a millwright. \n\nYou can think of them like kitchen aid stand mixers. Except there are many different types.",

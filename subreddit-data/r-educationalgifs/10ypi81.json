It spread over such a wide area that 15 million of our citizens were affected by this disaster.\n\nAs much as I can, I try to announce the severity of this disaster to the whole world, and I will continue. Thank you for your support.\n\nGlad the amount of karma on reddit worked for the first time, it raises my awareness and allows the post to hot page fast. Thank you also on Reddit for helping me publicize this disaster.\n\nIf you want to support us, you can review the disaster title I pinned in my profile.\n\nGreetings.",

Changing 5 to 4, then, could be somewhat of a trip up because it never makes it clear whether N is always the total length of the set or just the last term to include in the summation.  \nIt never explains what i is doing or what it means. You're expected to notice and deduce it for yourself, here. More likely, you're expected to already be familiar with the notation and not need it explained.",

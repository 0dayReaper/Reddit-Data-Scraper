While the friction between each other piece of wood and the strength of the dowel rods are important, most of it relies on the feet. On grass and mounded dirt, this bridge has excellent efficiency, but on smooth concrete or ice, it would collapse with little to no weight.\n\nSource: I\u2019m an Astrophysicist\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people commenting \u201chow does Astrophysics have anything to do with this bridge design.\u201d In order to get a degree in any field of physics, you must take the same foundation courses as most engineers (and they all involve friction in some way, shape, or form). Engineering, Physics, and Mathematics degrees share a lot of the same classes, and each person in those specified fields have a great understanding of what each other is supposed to do, the only differences involve the duties they have further into their careers and what their specializations include.",

If you look at the structure, in the center the cross beam is protected from movement by two board on top, and one board on bottom, which means that even if the friction is lost, there is little room for the board to move. However, on the edges, there is only a single board on top and bottom, leaving one of the sides free. If there is significant force applied in that direction, then it would collapse quickly.",

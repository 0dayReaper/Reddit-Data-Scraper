But when I get on a plane or go up a mountain too quickly my ears don't pop. That pressure just increases and increases. On transcontinental flights the pain is so bad that I have seriously considered taking a butter knife and slicing the skin open to relieve the pressure. If that is what people with migraines go through regularly you have my deepest empathy.",

When people with healthy ear drums relieve pressure, it's not like their ear drums pop that would be insane. It's more likely that you have a chronic sinus infection or a cranial dysfunction/dystrophy blocking your eustachian tube that connects to your inner ear, exactly to drain it and account for different pressure in the environment. This could have a correlation with your high tendency for ear infections.",

They did the surgery to put tubes in my eardrums to allow the fluid to drain out. It was gross but as a kid I didn't know any better, I just didn't have the raging pain anymore. \n\nThe tubes are supposed to naturally fall out shortly after, and the eardrum heals over nicely. However my left one lodged itself sideways instead. So I had another surgery to take it out, and a patch placed over the hole. That's when I was 6, I'm 39 now, and doctors can still see the patch so I guess that's permanent. \n\nI don't care though, it was all worth it, including the slight hearing loss, in exchange for being free from the excruciating ear infections. Drilling a hole in a part of my head to drain a fluid was literally one of the best things to ever happen to me LOL. So yeah I daydream of a tube of tube or spout, or pressure valve, in my skull to relieve my migraines.",

The first 24 hours after suck since you feel kinda weak and your nose is very sore but once you get past that and get some decent rest I felt like normal. I wasn't allowed to play sports for a weak or workout but everything was fine. \n\nNormally during the late Spring/early Summer my nose would be clogged up all the time but now it rarely happens and if it does it goes away pretty quickly.",

Also there are plenty of meds to take daily to reduce the frequency in the first place! Migraine suffers are so tough that they are like, please just take the edge off idk if you even get rid of them. Really it\u2019s possible. A 2-day headache is awful and I\u2019ve been there. Mine aren\u2019t totally gone, not at all but they are far better than they used to be AND the ones I get are more manageable because I catch them early. I take the triptan, lay down with ice around my head (inflammation right?), cover my eyes and no phone(!) for at least 20 min. Then I get up and drink a caffeinated drank. Usually a coke. I tell myself the sugar helps.\n\nPain relievers like Advil? Or painkillers like Vicodin? Try different pain relievers until you find ones that work. Advil doesn\u2019t do shit when I have a migraine or even a tiny headache. (Works for other owies so don\u2019t @ me) I use Tylenol or aleve. Be careful. Most people don\u2019t know that too many Tylenol is only a few more than the max dose listed. It\u2019s not like Advil at all. And migraines make people desperate",

Triptans actually do work quite well at breaking sinus migraines (I get them about once a month).  Be careful with them though, they can cause people like me to feel like they are having a minor heart attack. I have to use a specific one called zolmitriptan because the regular medication, sumatriptan, is too fast acting which my doctor said is what causes that feeling. The medication I'm on is a slower release so I just feel like my blood pressure is up, but I still get the migraine to \"break\" and go away.  Once the medication works though, I basically can feel a pop right beside my eye, and I can feel the sinus drain away and stop hurting.",

It gives a list of foods you should remove aka \u201cThe Migraine Diet\u201d. I was on Sumatriptans, burning through my prescriptions faster than I could refill them, migraines 3-4 times a month lasting for several days, aura, etc for years. I finally read the book, went cold turkey on my medicines and tried the migraine diet and IT CHANGED MY LIFE. I now have a migraine maybe 1-2 times a year. It\u2019s not easy at first, as you\u2019re withdrawing from a lot of things (caffeine was a big trigger for me, but made me feel awful for the first week or so going without), but it\u2019s worth it. Look up the book, read the reviews, it works. You have nothing to lose trying this approach. Good luck!",

                                                    "comment": "My first neurologist recommended the book \u201cHeal your headache\u201d which has patient-centric strategies to use to take on migraines. I don\u2019t think you need to buy the book, look up \u201clist of migraine triggers\u201d and eliminate them from your diet. The book makes it simple but I think there are probably resources online. The trick is that you won\u2019t get a migraine every time you eat them. Just like you don\u2019t get a migraine every time the weather changes. The book talks about thresholds. You need enough triggers to put you over the edge. You control the ones you can, like foods, so you are less likely to hit that threshold when the things you can\u2019t control are not in your favor.\n\nThe strategy regarding food-based triggers is to eliminate all known triggers for enough time for them to stop effecting you. Inflammation is a long process so 6-8 weeks. This sounds like a long time but for people that are already suffering, you know that your life is often already on hold. Then add them back one at at time and eat a lot of it. I started with chocolate and had 2-3 servings a day or tried to and tracked my migraines and waited again 6-8 weeks to see if they spiked. Then I added in my other favorites one at a time, like cheese. (I\u2019m not affiliated with the book and I don\u2019t agree with all of the things it claims as someone who has struggle with this for &gt;10 years)\n\nI tried the keto diet but it made me worse. When I stopped I felt better, so this was a flag for me that I had food triggers. Most of the keto-centric foods are migraine triggers: cheese, yogurt, chocolate, and I can\u2019t remember what they are pork rinds with flavoring on them. \n\nMy biggest trigger, and the reddit mind will roast me for this, is MSG. It\u2019s called yeast extract usually or a number of other names so it\u2019s REALLY hard to get it entirely out of your diet. I mainly eat things that I cook and spice myself or that I know wouldn\u2019t have it in the ingredients like tortilla chips. I learned how to cook this way and was incredibly lucky to have a really great friend who is a person who likes cooking and propped me up so I didn\u2019t starve. \n\nMSG is in almost everything pre-prepared: freezer meals, flavored chips, some sauces and dips. It\u2019s the flavor enhancer. It works. I stopped eating these things and my migraines improved. Not entirely but marginally, which is typical. I have tried to undo this and had it bite me in the ass. I am skeptical of the gluten people and all that but here I am. I thought they were feeling better because they were eating less junk. I promise you I still eat tons of junk and crap, just with no MSG and it works for me.\n\nIt\u2019s also naturally occurring in foods as an amino acid so people make an argument that if you eat tomatoes you can eat MSG. I have a PHD in biology. This is not how animal systems work. Free MSG is going to absorbed into the system much more easily and the blood concentration is going to skyrocket relatively uninhibited. (Disclaimer I haven\u2019t seen data for MSG. This is based on a an advanced understanding of GI systems and metabolism.) MSG as an amino acid in a plant is going to be harder to digest and break down to just the MSG molecule if it does get broken down to that level. Imagine one amino acid in a chain of them which makes a protein. That entire thing has to be dismantled during digestion. Here, at least both ends of the glutamate amino acid have to be freed. It\u2019s going to take time. If the tomato is storing MSG then it will still have to be freed from whatever storage vacuole or capsule it\u2019s in. It\u2019s not pour on the tomato like salt like food. The concentration levels over time are going to be totally different and might not even peak the same in the blood. The difference between these types of chemical exposures can absolutely change how the body response to a molecule.",

I'm actually working on a migraine-related project for my job and the whole \"I'd like to scoop my eye out with a spoon\" is actually something I've heard before!  I had no idea how bad cluster headaches got, or that some people have migraines all day every day. FWIW a whole new class of migraine meds have come onto the market in the last couple years that seem to be helping a lot of people, and there are all sorts of medical doohickeys (technical term) coming out that people are also finding help with. Hope you can find something that works.",

After which you go to the doctor to pull them out, which feels like pulling some nerves right out of your brain. He then proceeds to insert this long tube that acts like a vacuum cleaner to clean up all the dried blood left in the nose and sinuses. But all that dried blood is stuck to the walls and has to be torn off which feels like scraping something off your skull and brain. It's the worst 20 minutes I've ever experienced.

They will likely scope your sinuses and do an allergy test to tell you what\u2019s causing the inflammation which is trapping bacteria and causing an infection. You can then get allergy shots to become \u201cimmune\u201d to the allergens over time or if it\u2019s less severe just take a daily nasal spray to treat inflammation. \n\nIn my case I had to have a surgery to widen my sinus cavity to allow proper drainage. I used to get vomit and pass out sinus headaches once every 1-2 months and haven\u2019t had one in the 15ish years since surgery. I will still get headaches and frequent infections though cause I never did the allergy shots. I also can\u2019t use a Neti pot or Navage since I\u2019m always inflamed enough on one side that water doesn\u2019t pass through. The only way to clean my sinuses is to use Afrin first which I can\u2019t do regularly because of rebound congestion.\n\nTL;DR Sinuses are fucking stupid.",

I did a bunch of different stuff.  I don't know what would work for you but this is what I did.\n\nNeti pot with water just warm enough to clear your nose.  Only distilled water,  people have gotten brain eating amoebas with tap water.  Clean it well every few days with boiling water.\n\nI got 2 vaporizers and throw a blanket over myself and just breathe steam several times a day.  This probably helps the most.\n\n2 box fans with merv 11 filters duct taped to them.  If allergies is the problem it might help.  Merv 13 might be better I don't know if enough air with get through them though.\n\ncool mist humidifier to keep the humidity up overnight.  Also I got a hygrometer to monitor it through out the day.\n\ngreen smoothies, green tea, black tea all with antimicrobials ginger root tumeric root cinnamon habanero peppers garlic with fruit to make it palatable.  Homemade kefir.  While my sinuses were infected I would chew ginger root, cloves or put coconut oil in my mouth. \n\nI took antibiotics and allergy meds to deal with acute symptoms.  Once the bacterial infection was under control and I got my appetite back I started fasting for autophagy I was concerned I was getting polyps because my sense of smell and taste would come and go, sometimes it just smelled like rotting flesh.  It seems to be helping.  I use ultima or key nutrients electrolyte powder and try to fast anywhere from 24 to 72 hours.  For a while, I wasn't healthy enough to fast and my nose has been broken a few times mechanically it couldn't drain.  So it just dripped a bacterial infection into my stomach for 2 months.  Fasting kind of sucks but tea or coffee make it bearable and polyps are growths so autophagy might take care of them.  I haven't healed completely but I might.",

You are thinking of a swing  type check valve.\n\nWafer valves usually have two half discs mounted on a central sprung hinge.\n\nThe main purpose/benefit of a wafer check is that the design allows them to fit in tighter dimensions between flanges.\n\nThe downside however is that the central hinge causes a restriction in flow.\n\nA swing check valve is larger and requires much more space to install but causes no restriction in flow as the disc swings up into the body and out of the flowpath.",

In engines you have a lot of other factors at play too like the actual valves in the heads and such. \n\nFor cars it's probably a combination of \"it works good enough\" it's super simple and cheap to make and the fluid you're working with wont really impede moving the disc to a high degree.",

The gate comes down and blocks off the pipe. However you have to turn the handwheel quite a few times to lower the gate. What if you need a valve that you need to close quickly.\n\nThat's where a butterfly valve comes in. A quarter turn of the handle and the valve shuts. Why wouldn't you use this all the time? Depend on the velocity of the material going through the pipe, quickly shutting the valve could cause damage to the valve and to the pump supplying the pipe. \n\nA check valve is a safety valve that's designed to close if material starts moving in a pipe in the wrong direction. It's basically a flap on a hinge that only opens one way. If things are going as they should the material in the pipe pushes open the flap as it passes through the valve. If something should happen that would force material in the opposite direction, the flap closes and stops any material from going any further.\n\nOutside of these three you can have valves designed to regulate the flow of material (globe valves and needle valves), safety valves that are design to open if a certain pressure in a line is reached (relief valves), as well as different valves designed for materials at extreme temperatures, pressures and viscosities.",

Gate valves are probably harder to open or close but usually due to liquid residue.   Water can calcify on the gate and you have to break it during opening/closing.   Also denser liquids or wastewater sludge or debris can clog the channels and its hard to get a good seat.  And yeah, you can get mineral deposits in the seat too from potable water.   Both these valves are typically manually or mechanically operated.",

You can also just put it in the microwave with a wet (not dripping, rung out) paper towel on top. I also toast each side so it\u2019s crispy and makes homemade burritos just as good as any restaurant. Flour tortillas are just flour and lard (and salt and baking powder), so getting it warm softens the lard and makes them a lot more malleable. If you *really* want to upgrade your burritos, make your own tortillas! It\u2019s super easy and fun and the result is so worth it. You don\u2019t realize how much flavor a tortilla can really have until you have one freshly made, it\u2019s not just something to hold the ingredients.",

What I did was kept my pan on heat setting 1 and put a tortilla on, every 30 or so seconds I\u2019d grab it and tug each side a bit. It\u2019s not going to stretch like raw dough or anything, but when you pull it should have give to it. Too long or too high heat, it\u2019ll get crispy and break when you pull. Too little time or heat, it will still be cold and tear. I love cooking so I\u2019ll spend a couple hours testing different things for future recipes haha",

That process can be reversed with heat, which is why all flour-based products soften after being warmed up. A warm piece of bread is squishy, while a room-temperature slice is springy. This means you can heat a flour tortilla on a skillet to resoften it, though it will never be as soft and pliable as when it was freshly cooked. \n\n\nThe same retrogradation occurs in corn tortillas as well, but it is much harder (if not impossible) to reverse. You can get close by running corn tortillas under some water, then throwing them on a hot skillet to steam them, but the result will depend entirely on the quality and age of the corn tortilla.",

I prefer to tuck in only the top section of tortilla. In the video, you can see he tucks both the top and bottom flaps before rolling. This creates a thick wedge that is more likely to open while you eat. Tucking only the top flap makes it more like a package which is secure throughout the whole meal. Happy burrito-ing!",

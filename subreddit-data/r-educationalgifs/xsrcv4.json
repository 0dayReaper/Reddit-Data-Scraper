On the equinoxes it rises due East, and at other times, either in the SE or the NE.\n\nHowever, the variability in sunrise location is dependent on a location's latitude. To demonstrate this, the sunrise location over the year is shown for 5 different locations on Earth:\n\n\\+45 N, -70 W: in Maine, US\n\n\\+22.5, -70 W: in the ocean near Turks and Caicos\n\n0.0, -70 W: the equator in Western Brazil\n\n\\-22.5, -70 W: in Chile,\n\n\\-45 S, -70 W: in Argentina\n\nYou can see that the range of the sunrise annual change is greater the father away from the equator you are. This is a consequence of the Earth's shape, as well as its orbital tilt.\n\nCredits to CCNY Planetarium and openspaceproj.",

I live in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia at 42 degrees south but grew up in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia at I think around 2 degrees south.\n\nThe difference in sunrise and sunset positions over the year is pretty big. Also there isn't much twilight in the tropics, the sun just plunges straight down and then it's dark. Whereas here in Hobart there can be what feels like hours of twilight.\n\nThe other thing I've noticed in my travels is that the sun and moon move counterclockwise through the sky in the souther hemisphere, but clockwise  in the Northern Hemisphere. When I was a kid I used to wonder why clocks go clockwise, until I realised that they were invented in the North and that's the way the sun goes up there.",

Not at all something we could physically observe on human time scales but cosmic ones, absolutely.\n\nEarth's rotation is also slowing by a fraction of a second every year due to drag from the moon and will eventually become tidally locked with it, unless the sun will go nova before that point.  I don't have the exact figures handy, but in dinosaur days the length of a complete rotation of the earth about its axis (one earth \"day\") was like half an hour shorter than today.  In a few more tens of million years we may need to add another leap day to the calendar, but I'm sure humanity as we know it will be long gone by then.",

So 45'N and 45'S should *not* have the same sunrise headings ; but in this animation that's exactly what is happening.\n\nTo add to this this, at about 80 degrees North, the \"sunrise\" is nearly directly South in Winter as if you go far North enough, it's permanently dark! At that time of the year at 80 degrees South, the sun is most certainly *not* rising from the South when you're near 80 degrees South!!",

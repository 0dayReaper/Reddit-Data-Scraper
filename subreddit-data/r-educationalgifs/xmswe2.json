Corals are colonial animals made of many polyps, which maintain the structure, provide food, and fend off competition or predators. Many saltwater aquarists struggle to maintain their own coral reefs without causing fights to break out.",

Meanwhile, our pipe cleaner coral on the right, seems to be growing like crazy. But if you notice, near the end of the timelapse, where it touches the base of the brain coral\u2019s territory, it seems to be withering. I at first thought it was the other way around. But now I think the brain coral (which is not exactly disintegrating) is the eater and not the eaten. Title of submission seems to indicate that too with the line about encroaching polyps being stung and digested, which makes sense since the pipe cleaner things are spreading like crabgrass.\n\nBut I\u2019m just an Anon on Reddit. What the fuck do I look like, Jacques Cousteau?\n\n\u201cHere we zee, on te right, a rather calm brain corral (sic). And on zee left, a quickly growing colony of fuzzee corrals\u2026\u201d",

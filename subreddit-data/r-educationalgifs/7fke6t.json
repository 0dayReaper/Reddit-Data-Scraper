Kennings are strongly associated with Old Norse and later Icelandic and Old English poetry.\n\nThey usually consist of two words, and are often hyphenated. For example, Old Norse poets might replace sver\u00f0 \"sword\" with an abstract compound such as \"wound-hoe\" (Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson: H\u00f6fu\u00f0lausn 8) or a genitive phrase such as randa \u00edss \u201cice of shields\u201d (Einarr Sk\u00falason: \u2018\u00d8xarflokkr\u2019 9).\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Because of their different sizes, the gears turn at different speeds or rpm(rotations per minute). Those are positioned on the real drive shaft, which turns the axle and wheels, but they are not connected to the drive shaft so they spin seperately from it. \n\nThe pink gears are connected to the drive shaft, so when one of them engages with one of the gears being turned by the red crank shaft, it turns the teal drive shaft at that rpm.\n\nWhen in 4th gear, the green drive shaft is engaged directly with the teal drive shaft so they are spinning at the same rpm. \n\nThere is also an extra orange gear that pops into place between the red shaft and the drive shaft gears when you put it in reverse so that it reverses the direction of rotation. \n\nEdit, format, colors, typos etc",

It seems to me that you\u2019d want 5th to do the job since I\u2019d expect that it\u2019s the most-used gear (from highway driving), and you could thus bypass the red shaft in that state for lesser wear and tear.\n\nI don\u2019t know shit about cars (or engineering in general) though, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing something.

The only slippage **within** the transmission is between the synchros and gears, where the synchro (pink, linked to the blue shaft) mates with the chosen gear (linked to the red shaft), the blue shaft and the selected gear probably not having the same speed. Since the red shaft is disconnected from the engine (via the clutch), there's not a lot of force, and thus you can switch gears without grinding... as long as you're not choosing 1st gear while moving or 2nd gear while moving fast, and you're not \"shoving it\" into a gear.",

Because of their different sizes, the gears turn at different speeds or rpm(rotations per minute). Those are positioned on the real drive shaft, which turns the axle and wheels, but they are not connected to the drive shaft so they spin seperately from it. \n\nThe pink gears are connected to the drive shaft, so when one of them engages with one of the gears being turned by the red crank shaft, it turns the teal drive shaft at that rpm.\n\nWhen in 4th gear, the green drive shaft is engaged directly with the teal drive shaft so they are spinning at the same rpm. \n\nThere is also an extra orange gear that pops into place between the red shaft and the drive shaft gears when you put it in reverse so that it reverses the direction of rotation. \n\nEdit, format, colors, typos etc\n",

The larger the ratio between a drive gear and an output gear is  (ie the drive gear is larger than the output gear) in this case the bottom red blue set, the faster the output is but the LESS leverage the drive gear has.\n\nHaving a low ratio (low gearing) will give the drive side (engine) maximum leverage but it will have to spin faster to achieve it.  That's basically what leverage is.  A large lever (you can think of gears as levers) will allow you to use less force over a longer period of time/distance to get much more force but at a shorter distance.\n\nSo selecting different gears gives you different final drive ratios.  That's what the equations in the gif are explaining.  They're taking the ratio of the drive gear vs the output gear and calculating the number of times the input shaft would spin to turn the output shaft one time.",

I've seen these nifty videos and gifs of manual transmissions a million times, there is a reason why you don't see them for automatics. That's because an automatic transmission is 99% magic. When I first learned about this in college, the professor said we would take a lecture to talk about manual transmissions. If we wanted to learn how an automatic worked, it would need a semester.",

My truck was 4wd and I found a cheap used transmission for a 2wd, so I had to swap the output shafts and in order to get to the retaining clip that held the output, all the guts of the transmission had to come out and go back in in the same order. It took me about 20 hours over a couple days but I got it done and installed and it worked, but I still have no clue how automatic transmissions work.  ",

The reason they don\u2019t usually grind, is because the throw ratios are low and the forks move the collars very quickly combined with the inherently low inertia of the relatively tiny gearbox. Grinding only happens in a dogbox when you shift slowly, and the shift drum type shifter makes it nearly impossible to shift slowly. In cars with dogboxes, you can also drive them without the clutch and no grinding with some practice. In both cases, it\u2019s practically impossible to up/downshift under load without the clutch. A fun way to unload the drivetrain, is to use the rev limiter. I never tried it on my motorcycle, but in my car that had a dogbox you could put pressure on the shifter and then it would pop into the next gear when the engine hit the limiter. ",

It's connected to the red lay shaft so they both spin as long as power is coming from the engine (ie the clutch pedal isn't depressed). The blue gears all constantly receive power from the the red shaft so they spin too, but they're on bearings so they can just rotate freely. Since the ratio between the blue gears and the corresponding gears on the red shaft are all different each blue gear spins at a different rate, giving different transmission speeds. When you move the gear selector you cause one of the pink shift collars to engage with one of the blue gears. The pink collars are all splined to the teal output shaft (note the grooves visible in the diagram) so when one of them engages with a gear it causes power to be transmitted from the input shaft, to the lay shaft, along to the appropriate gear, and from there to the output shaft via the shift collar. Reverse is a bit different because it has the orange idler gear, which slides in between the gear on the red shaft and it's counterpart on the teal shaft. Adding a third gear changes the direction of the teal gear's rotation, which means the car goes backward.\n\nThe equations are calculating gear ratio, which is basically the ratio between how fast the input and output shafts turn. Higher ratios provide more torque at the cost of lower top speed. In first gear the ratio is 4.125:1, meaning the input shaft turns 4.125 times for every 1 turn of the output shaft, which delivers the power needed to get the wheels turning from a standstill but doesn't let you go very fast. The ratios get progressively smaller up to 4th gear which is 1:1 or direct drive, so the input and output shafts spin at the same speed. 5th is an overdrive gear, meaning the output shaft actually spins faster than the input shaft; this allows for better efficiency but means there's not a lot of power available, so it's usually reserved for highway cruising. Most transmissions have a gear that is at or very close to a 1:1 ratio, as well as an overdrive.",

Ie I am at a point where without breaks I would roll back, but my holding the clutch at bite point i neither move forward or roll back.\n\nI dont understand how a rotating engine can be engaged enough to produce a breaking effect but without speed increasing. Are the gears just gently slipping each turn?",

Whereas if you do your test in a manual, you may drive both. If you only hold an automatic licence, people generally laugh at you. So you basically don't have a choice but to learn how to drive manual. I hate it though. Such a pain. I only ever intend on owning electric cars that don't even use gears, automatic or otherwise. ",

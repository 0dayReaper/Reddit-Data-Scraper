Very little chance of that happening with this knot, and maybe even the most important, the way this palomar knot cinches down on the hook it holds the hook at a better and more proper angle for bait presentation and a better chance at a quality hookset due to the positioning. Also the recommended knot from braid line manufacturers. Less slipping. If you could only learn one knot for fishing this should be the one. It's much better than the double improved cinch knot/Berkley trilene knot.",

Better knots out there when it comes to imparting more movement into a lure imo, kreh loop is good, but if you're not worried about that and just want strength then it's hard to beat a palomar.",

I did slam my brakes on, just far too late, and the van I hit sustained comparatively little damage (and the driver was fine, thank fuck!). Someone cut in front of him without looking and made him brake, and I didn't see his brake lights because of the sun's glare so didn't brake until I found myself suddenly a lot closer than intended... I was mortified and am a lot more attentive and careful about braking distance these days.",

(yup, using metric)\n\nThe distance(s)/time(t)/acceleration(a) equation is \"s = 1/2 a t^2\"  \nThis can be rearranged to t = sqrt(2s/a)  \nIn this scenario, a = gravity, ~= 10 ms^-2\n\nSo the melon takes sqrt(1/10) seconds to land = 316ms.\n\nNow, in the 1st part, the airbag appears to start deploying almost immediately, and is fully inflated and stable by the time the melon has fallen half the distance (25cm, so t=sqrt(0.05)=223ms)\n\nThe 2nd airbag doesn't deploy until *after* the melon is 1/2 crushed, so let's say it's fallen 60cm. That took at least sqrt(1.2/10) = 346ms\n\n**So, that 2nd one deployed c. 34/100 of a second late, not 7/100.**\n\nNow, if the 1st airbag inflated immediately, and the 2nd 70ms after dropping the melon, what would we see?\n\ns = 1/2 x 10 x 0.07^2 = 2.45cm\n\n**7/100s after being dropped, the melon would only have travelled 2.45cm (less than 1 inch)**\n\nWe know the airbag takes c. 200ms to be fully inflated and stable, so where is the melon after 270ms?\n\n1/2 x 10 x .27^2 = 36.45cm. ie, \n\n**The airbag would be full when the melon is 13.55cm from the base.**\n\nI've just found out that an airbag is fully deployed much quicker than 200ms, which makes the gif even more unrealistic than even I had thought.\n\n\" The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly *inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds*. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60-80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact.\" ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag#Operation))\n\nedit: a word. Also, I love [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb_SIMOpoZ4) airbag :)\n\n\n\n",

Is this supposed to imply that I will dramatically explode if my airbag is slightly faulty? Obviously, a bad airbag can be dangerous, but this gif is pretty silly. \n\nEDIT:  Guys, I understand the analogy of two objects colliding. My point is that a dropped watermelon exploding is a ridiculously dramatic illustration and hopelessly unrealistic simulation of what would actually happen to your head in a real car crash. We're meant to take this as some eye-opening physics demonstration when it is just condescending and meaningless. It comes off as a bad parody of that [\"This is your brain on dugs\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5wwECXTJbg) PSA from the 90s. There are plenty of videos out there of actual crash tests if you want a real demonstration of airbags.",

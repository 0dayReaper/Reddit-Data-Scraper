It is such a luxury, I can't believe I'd been using those cheap-o, barrow little $1 funnels from Walmart.   \n\nThis upgraded funnel will swallow quarts of oil so quickly, because of the wide mouth on it.  \nAnd when I'm pouring from quart size bottles (not often, I usually buy 5-qt jugs) it is molded to hold the bottle for me.",

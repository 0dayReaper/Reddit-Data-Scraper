Velociraptor (like every dinosaur) cannot rotate and overlap those bones because they lack the rounded and curved ends to allow for that rotation of the forearms. As such their palms would permanently face each other as if ready to hug or clap, but that's because most bipedal dinosaurs would use a wide hugging motion of the forearms to grasp struggling prey and hold it close against the body to subdue them while also helping to stabilize the body forward of the hips for bites.",

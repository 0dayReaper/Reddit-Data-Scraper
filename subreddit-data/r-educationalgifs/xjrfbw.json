Go look at videos and books. Science that shit and do experiments with different stitches on scraps to see what holds up. \n\nAlso, darning as I\u2019ve seen it involves a really strong weave pattern, like that of a loom.

Or even using a small piece of cloth on the back side of the hole and then stitching it as seen above, except making sure to go through both the denim and cloth behind it? \n\nI'm asking because I don't know and would like to better understand the process.\n\nIf they had been interweaving the thread before passing through the denim at the corner points, would that count as true mending vs just covering the hole?",

Not loading your back in ways it has not adapted to (ie: lifting very heavy objects repeatedly with zero practice or preparation) is probably a smart move, no matter what your posture is, and once your back as adapted to being able to handle lifting heavy objects, don\u2019t stress too much about keeping it perfectly straight.",

Usually it's about increasing abdominal pressure and core stiffness so that you can lift heavier weights without running out of core strength/stability. If there is any injury prevention reason for using a weight belt, it's usually secondary to this performance benefit.\n\nLifting heavier weights exposes you to more risk of injury, so it's not surprising that he found an increase in injuries correlated to powerlifting belt use.\n\nThat's just my take as an amateur though.

Lifting with appropriate form allows for greater efficiency, and reduces internal load, which likely does help reduce injury risk.\n\nOn your last paragraph, something to keep in mind vis a vis permanent injury: the weight of the evidence at this point suggests that one of the big reasons that lower back injuries are frequently disabling is because as a society we create narratives about true back and low back pain that make people fearful. Fear of further injury, beliefs that the back is fragile, beliefs that back injuries are permanent, and a variety of false beliefs about disc herniations are all bigger risk factors for chronic disability as a result of low back pain than actual tissue damage. This is because rather than being a simple \u201cdamage detection\u201d system, pain is actually a threat detection system, and people\u2019s preexisting attitudes and beliefs dramatically influence the pain experience. Pain works more like hunger than how people often imagine it working. Just like passing your favorite restaurant can make you feel like you\u2019re starving when you were barely hungry before, having believing that back injuries are catastrophic makes back pain much worse. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to discourage you from continuing to do what you\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s obviously working for you, so keep at it! Just remember that if you do hurt you\u2019re back at some point, it\u2019s probably going to heal 100%, and you don\u2019t need to treat your back like it\u2019s made out of glass.",

Human bodies are resilient and adaptive, you can move safely through a very large varieties of motions. The most important factor in not injuring yourself is to not perform tasks that are significantly outside what you are adapted to.",

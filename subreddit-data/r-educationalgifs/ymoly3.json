If you walked into a Sunglass Hut, Lenscrafters, Pearl Vision, etc. you could find a pair relatively cheap and still high quality. If you\u2019re on a budget, brands like Smith are good quality at a reasonable price. Maui Jim is my personal favorite but they\u2019re more expensive. Just really depends on your budget and style preferences. A lot of people favor Ray-Bans as well - a nice middle ground between the two. Even more high end designers like Gucci, Prada, Hugo Boss, etc will have polarized options. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t waste money on anything at a gas station or kiosk in the mall etc.",

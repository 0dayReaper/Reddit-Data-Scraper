Because opal's silica is not in a crystalline structure, it's considered a mineraloid instead.\n\nLab grown opals are made using the same sphere patterns of silica as natural opals, and resin is used to fill in the tiny gaps since there is no water in them that the natural stones have. The silica sphere structures that create opalescence are chemically identical to natural opals. \n\nThese opal are created under lab conditions to be as close as possible to the real thing, just like we get lab grown diamonds.\n\nThese are made by Kyocera, they secured the patent from from Pierre Gilson, who invited a process of making 100% silica opals in the 1960s. They used that information to develop these synthetic hybrids.",

In sanding, it\u2019s a small(er) surface area that\u2019s being scraped away at a relatively slow rate. With cutting, it\u2019s a large surface area and a large thickness being removed from the piece with every rotation of the bit. Because more mass is being moved away at a higher rate, more energy is required. The work piece at cutting tool are going to emit some of that energy in the form of heat. Sanding will also make your work piece warm, but not nearly as hot as a cutting tool.",

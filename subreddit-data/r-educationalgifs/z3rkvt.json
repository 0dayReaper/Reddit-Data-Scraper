You can mount these tools into an adapter called a collet. A collet holds the tool by friction, but it interfaces into the mill through a key slot. This key is only like a millimeter-sized notch that slots into a corresponding slot in the collet, but that tiny bit of interference (plus some other things) prevents the collet from rotating in the mill\u2019s interface. \n\nThe analogy here is that friction can hold things in pretty well, but if you need something to Not Move Unless Told To, you just make a small protrusion, bump, or interference that has to be forced past before it becomes free. While friction may be PART of this, the interference is by far the most important. In the grenade example, it\u2019s the spread pin legs.",

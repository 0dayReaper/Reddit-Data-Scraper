Though as someone who\u2019s been speedsolving for 15 years, i can\u2019t see how this would be particularly helpful as an \u201cinstruction\u201d. There are plenty of concepts related to solving a cube and this won\u2019t really teach you those concepts any better than normal. In fact i could see it being even more confusing for a beginner/intermediate solver as visualizing the movements through circles will never be how the movements happen on a cube as it\u2019s a cube and not a sphere. Though more power to anyone who can glean info from this they never knew before!",

I think it was grt a cross on one face then do the corners then flip the cube and get the two middle side pieces of each face then the top cross and top corners.it would take me like 5 or 10 minutes and i dont remember the patterns now. \n\nBut i feel like i could solve the circle one without following any specific patterns.",

With the most basic solve method, you effectively work through various patterns of rotation of the pieces based on the position of faces vs. segments of the cube. \n\nBasically, there is no such thing as a unsolvable Rubik's cube, any method of solving will eventually result in a solved cube.",

Which I've now lost.\n\nBut the instructions said something like this:\n\n1. Hold the cube with the side with a yellow middle square facing you and the side with a white middle square facing up. \n\n2. Solve the left column of the yellow side. \n\nThen the instructions became more detailed and I can't remember any of them but it bloody worked!  I solved my first ever rubix cube.\n\nI'm sure there will be similar instructions online now.",

If it were just about boil-off, it would be better to have the cryogenic fuel on the first stage in order to use it up quickly.\n\nRP-1 provides more thrust, but hydrogen is more efficient.\n\nAt takeoff, you want to get out of the dense atmosphere as quickly as possible and the craft is also at its heaviest. Therefore, you want to maximize thrust to accelerate as quickly as you can.\n\nWhen in space, you want to maximize propellant efficiency. Thrust is less of an issue without the atmosphere - you can usually just run the engine longer to account for lower thrust.",

Boosters crash into land somewhere remote and they sometimes grab them (because they are on land and it is more reasonable to do so). Delta heavy? No. Any ULA rocket? No. They all go into the drink. We don\u2019t care about ITAR for these because the ocean is fucking huge, people we would be worried about don\u2019t know where they land and don\u2019t have the resources to go 14k feet underwater and pull them out.

You spin around, forever falling to the earth in a stable orbit. If you wanted to bring it down it would only take enough fuel to slow that sideways momentum, but most satellite orbits degrade naturally and they burn up in the atmosphere. It's actually not friction that burns things up upon reentry, friction is only a small part of it, the biggest factor is compression. You are going so fast that the air can't get out of the way quick enough, and you create massive pressure right in front of you.",

It won't be immediate either, it causes kidney failure, which takes a day or two to show up, and by that time it's too late as the kidney is already destroyed.\n\nSome dogs (&lt; 10% I think it was) are \\*apparently\\* just fine eating grapes, and it also depends on the dog's size and how many grapes they ate. But eating any amount of grape or juice or anything related to grapes should be treated as a medical emergency. Like get to the vet ASAP for inducing vomiting, flooding the system with fluids and charcoal. Minutes matter as it only takes a very little amount to do serious and permanent damage to the kidneys.",

Elephants use their trunk to draw in water, then squirt it into their mouths, rather than bend down. They will drink directly from a source, so long as they can do it easily, ie; standing in deep enough water they can just drink from it, or maneuver under a running water source.  My uncle, who worked with elephants for decades, said, at a certain age, he could just hand them the hose and they\u2019d put it in their mouth to drink, and when done, they\u2019d proceed to hold the hose over their heads and backs to cool/bath themselves. Some of them would hand over the hose to other elephants, while others would hold it, possessively, so others could drink, but not have hand it over. They, apparently, really loved playing in water, so getting the hose and being able to rinse themselves, was fun. They loved swimming in the river, and even when it froze, several inches thick of ice, they\u2019d smash it open to go swimming. Bring such massive creatures, even after an ice water dip, there would be steam coming off their skin. My uncle spent 35 years working with elephants, all over the world, and has a ton of wild stories.",

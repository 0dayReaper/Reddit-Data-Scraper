They would describe other colors by adding a noun in front of the word for red. So the sea isn't blue, it's \"sea-red\" and grass isn't green, it's \"grass-red\" \n\nThey also observed and interviewed a group of people in Central Africa, they also describe most colors, with exception of the sky, as a tint of yellow. Researchers think its because they see a lot more yellow tints than we do and thus that word developed more.",

But he takes a few Lego pieces each time as \"leftovers\"\n\nWhen Joe sees Bob with a Lego car, he needs to take it and rebuild it into a house. He also keeps a few pieces.\n\nWhen Steve sees Joe with a Lego house, he needs to rebuild it into a rocketship, and of course, keeps a few pieces.\n\nIf you give Steve a rocketship what will happen?\n\nBob turns the spaceship into a slightly smaller car. Joe turns the car into a slightly smaller house, Steve turns the house into a slightly smaller rocketship, Bob now has a rocketship to rebuild but it's just a bit smaller than the last one he rebuilt. This will continue until there aren't enough Legos left to complete the next rebuild\n\nThe Legos represent the energy stored in the chemical bonds of each liquid. A little bit is lost with each transformation. The people represent the three \"reactive pairs\"; that is, when two of them exist at the same time (one with a Lego item, the other without), they react, and the output of that pair reacting creates the configuration needed for the start of the next one. And the Legos that they each keep represent the \"waste product\" of the reactions; that is, some energy is lost each time a pair reacts, usually in the form of non-reactive byproducts.",

(I've actually found a few worthwhile products, sites, and services from ads, but I've had enough bad experiences that I absolutely *never* click an ad and do my research to make sure they're legit and go directly to the website via Google or typing in the URL)\n\nAs an alternative, I'm very willing to pay a subscription fee, but I need to get enough value out of the deal. This would very likely be the only article from the San Antonio Express that I'll read this month, and maybe even all year. That's a bit hard for me to justify a subscription fee for (their 99\u00a2  promotion is actually fairly reasonable, but I've been burned with hard-to-cancel subscriptions automatically renewing at higher prices before, so I'm wary. If it was just a one time payment that wouldn't renew, even if it only gave me like 3 articles a year, I'd be more likely to pay it)",

They seem to be removing these just because they are offending someone? Sure, it's a Nazi symbol, it's hateful. But it was done because the person buried there was a Nazi who died a POW.\n\nIf people touring saw that, they should be interested in why nazis were buried there, and look at the history and circumstances? Instead it's just swastika = bad, remove it so I'm not troubled by history?\n\nI'm aware this is similar to the confederate monuments that were being replaced recently, but this seems different. Those are statues built to amplify a figure. These are graves of the dead. Isn't the honorable thing to do in situation to bury them under the flag they fought for?",

Actual Nazism was rooted in a strong belief in German superiority, German conquest, a peculiar German racial science, and a number of other fundamental beliefs that were largely unique to a specific time and place in history.\n\nNeo-Nazis don't actually share most of the specific beliefs of the Nazis. They're more of a loose ideology of white nationalist groups, many who exist outside Germany and have no German heritage or belief in German superiority, and sometimes have nothing in common with the Nazis other than a general belief in white supremacy and the adoption of some Nazi iconography.  Very few neo-Nazis are actual Germans who want to recreate the Third Reich in Europe.",

He was drafted in 1943 if I recall and came out a staff sergeant. I wish I knew his story, he wouldn\u2019t talk about it. The only story I know is that he hated the song \u201cO Tannenbaum\u201d because they could hear the Germans singing it across the lines.",

Then we put through a metal rod that fits perfectly with both, sometimes there is some glue-type thing to make sure it stick but usually that\u2019s unnecessary. Then we dig it down so the base is completely covered (it is pretty big so it doesn\u2019t fall over).

Apples of the Earth. Apples tasted like potatoes until we bred them to be sweeter.~~ (this may be inaccurate, see comment below)  Bananas used to be all seeds and almost no flesh, watermelons were mostly seeds and pith, etc.    \n Literally everything we eat has been selectively bred for hundreds of years to be tastier than it was back then, and sweet things in general were really hard to come by in most places until sugar cane started getting mass farmed and exported around the world by the colonial powers. Things taste a lot sweeter when you aren't eating sugar all the time like most of us do now.\n\nThe Mayans used chocolate in a drink that they also added chilis to, it's safe to say they didn't expect it to be sweet. They liked it dark.\n\nYou also don't need a blender to crush or chop things, you can do it with a mortar and pestle, a knife, a stone, etc. It just takes longer.\n\nIf you ever ask yourself why the first person to eat X did so, it's important to remember that 1) people were way more used to eating plants and things they picked off brushes and trees so it was much less weird, and 2) food in general was harder to come by so that person was probably starving. All fermented foods are basically rotten, just rotten with the right bacteria in the right conditions. So someone was probably really hungry when they said fuck it and ate rotten food only to discover it actually tasted good.     \nPart of making cocoa requires fermenting the seeds. So someone probably cooked some rotten seeds and discovered the inside of those seeds tasted good. They probably did try cooking the seeds without fermenting them in better times only to discover the fermentation was necessary. It probably took a while, i doubt someone figured out the whole dozen or so step process by themselves in a week.   \nIf you'd never seen a lobster before would you immediately think, \"yeah, lemme cook that water bug and eat it?\" Probably not. That's why they were poor people food. But if you hadn't had a proper meal in weeks? I've heard stories of people eating grass during famines.",

I looked it up and found this:\n\n&gt;According to the Global Trees Campaign, Malus sieversii is a wild apple native to the mountains of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and China. Research has shown that this fruit, also called the Asian wild apple, is one of the main forefathers of our domesticated apple. It's small and sour, unlike the sweet apples we eat today.\n\nhttps://www.treehugger.com/fruit-and-veggies-that-used-look-whole-lot-different-than-they-do-today-4864247\n\nSo apples were likely more sour than sweet, like crabapples or citron, not potatoes. The point about them not being sweet still stands. I remember them not being popular in Britain around the Middle Ages because of the taste, I think I just misremembered the why.",

Probably started with something simpler that had a different use. what else did humans use that has a string a stick?  Probably a bow and arrow. I\u2019d imagine our ancestors would pluck an empty bow when telling hunting stories over a fire and then gradually try to outcompete each other, increased the sound made by plucking the bow by increasing the size of wood or getting a hollow piece of wood or attacking a gourd to one end. Give it a few thousand years and voila you have stringed instruments",

What we do is spread the seeds out in the sun to dry, wash/scrub out the dried pulp, then leave it out to dry again for weeks. There's really no definitive time other than making sure it's very dry. Then when there's enough seeds, we roast it on a giant wok. Remove the dried skins and then roast it again and remove the dry skins/husk. We do this by hand without a winnowing machine so we'd use a woven tray to throw the cacao in the air and the wind blows away the husk. Then we run the nibs through a grinder twice before packing it in puck-like tablets with a mold. It's a lot of work especially without machines so we only did this a couple times a year.\n\nI really miss it. All the imported tablea I can find now taste like waxy trash because of fillers.",

However, to get the big picture, here is the other side of the argument:\n\n\u201c\n\nFair Trade is profitable for traders in rich countries. It is also aimed at richer farmers: in order to join Fairtrade, cooperatives must meet quality and political standards which means their farmers must be relatively skillful and educated. Critics point out that these farmers are, therefore, far from the poorest farmers. The majority of Fairtrade suppliers are in the higher income or middle income developing countries, such as Costa Rica and Mexico, with relatively few in the poorest countries. Mexico has 70 times the GNP per capita as Sierra Leone, and much larger coffee farms. The minimum wage of agricultural workers in Peru is US$3 per day and the average income of Fairtrade farmers in Bolivia was US$900/year, much higher than normal agricultural incomes in Africa and much of Asia. Critics say this diverts money from the poorest farmers.[8]\n\n\u201c\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade_debate\n\nhttps://www.aier.org/article/fair-trade-is-still-a-fraud/",

It needs to be ground until there\u2019s absolutely 0 lumps, usually a mill is required to get it to that point.\n\nOn top of the grainy texture, it will not melt in your mouth unless it\u2019s tempered. It\u2019ll just be hard and chalky. This stuff isn\u2019t easy. Don\u2019t waste your time and money without researching it first, or you may not be happy with the results.",

Going into it I knew it wasn't possible to get 100% smooth, but I didn't want to spend $300 on a melanger for a one time thing. If I got into it as a hobby I'd definitely invest in one. My goal was just to make something that tasted like chocolate and it tasted really good, more like a Mexican or Taza chocolate. Smoother than sand, more like silt.\n\nThis was my first time tempering chocolate. It set quickly, was shiny, had a nice snap and melted but I don't know why the cocoa butter separated. I assume it's a fat bloom but I don't understand why it has the all the other characteristics of tempered chocolate. I was hoping someone could explain how I'd fix it. Here's more detail about my process: https://imgur.com/gallery/Wx7d5xb",

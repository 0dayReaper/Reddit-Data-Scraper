This effect is caused by the low framerate of the video. When the plate thing spins faster, it appears to change direction and speed because it starts spinning more than one half time for every frame of the video. This is called aliasing, and is also why helicopters sometimes look like the rotor is stationary or very slow on some videos.\n\nAlso, a little more advanced: because of the difference in angular symmetry between the inner and outer patterns, the aliases are different. Imagine rotating a 4-point star and an 8-point star 1/16th of a revolution.",

If an image displayed on a screen has a sharp contour between two colors (a black area right next to a white area, for example), but the contour doesn't exactly align with the pixel grid, the line between them becomes really choppy. Pixellated.\nAnti-aliasing in this context checks how much of a given pixel is in each area, and changes the color of the pixel to the geometric average of the two colors. In this example, a pixel that is 70% black and 30% white would become a dark grey instead of just black.",

Like, surely we can go bigger (Oil tankers, etc), but for shipping container vessels, the extra trip around South America probably isn't worth the trade off for a bigger ship that can fit more cargo? ...or something?\n\nEdit: A quick Google search makes it seem like it's in fact the opposite, that the canal is adjusting to the newer sizes of ships: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal_expansion_project",

The locks come in three groups. The lower seven locks, Foxhangers Wharf Lock to Foxhangers Bridge Lock, are spread over \u00be of a mile (1.2 km).\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

For the Panama, it just wasn't feasible though because of the heavy rain and jungle in the area, and like most things back in those days, a lot of people died building it. \n\nAnother fun fact: the USA secured a 100 year lease on the canal. Jimmy Carter gave Panama ownership in 1977 in a treaty that required the canal always be neutral. ",

They got rid of it. \n\nMosquitos that carry malaria were more difficult to control because they laid their eggs in swampy water.  The idea was the same but they had to go into the jungle and spray insecticide and drain swampy areas if they could. \n\nThey did a really good job against malaria as well",

One horrific fact I learned is that before they realized that mosquitos spread the disease, they would put the posts of hospital beds in pots of water to keep ants out of the beds. So the open air hospital was littered with mosquito breeding grounds that were spreading the disease they were trying to treat. If you were admitted to the hospital it was basically a death sentence. As such, a large portion of the workers that died just remained in the field and were unaccounted for.  The French effort in Panama has to be one of the biggest blunders in history. ",

It's not cheap to constantly be raising and water like that, and building technology is a lot cheaper than it was in 1904. Panama Canal was the most expensive construction project in the history of the US at the time. The idea is already being floated around, it's called \"The New Panama Canal\", would likely cost 3.5-5 Billion, original canal cost $352 million in 1904 which is like 9-10 billion today. \n\n",

On average 10 hours, our fastest run was when we were the first ship in the convoy and there were no delays which was 7 hours. This is in the old canal, never passed the new one for the larger vessels. It all depends how fast the pilot on board can push the ship and this depends on any delays (traffic) in the locks, sometimes we had to wait 2-3 hours for fog to pass, available tugs etc.. We had canal passage where we would go past the first locks coming from the atlantic and we dropped anchor on the lake (gatun lake) only to have another pilot for example after 12 hours one time even 24 hours. It all depends but for us 10 hours was average since the pilot adjusts the speed depending on the situation ahead of us. Usually takes the longest being last or almost last in the convoy.\n\nEdit: Also just a small piece of info for the curious. \nIn Panama the pilot has full command of the vessel, in most countries the pilot is only there to assist and the captain has the final word. Panama crew come on board via tug boat before the locks and the vessel's crew usually only operates the winches or carry out any orders from the pilot, it's really boring after the first 2 times. These guys also sell souveniers to the crew as well as some bullshit called blackstone which is supposedly like viagra and local sim cards which were selling like hot cakes when we knew we would anchor at gatun. You can also spot crocodiles in the water and weird ass birds which look like they are frozen because they don't move and have their wings up in a strange position",

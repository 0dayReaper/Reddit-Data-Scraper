This led to a policy of unit replacement rather than repair in situ. Deltic engines were easily removed after breakdown, generally being sent back to the manufacturer for repair, although after initial contracts expired both the Royal Navy and British Railways set up their own workshops for overhauls.*",

So you can in effect think of it as three straight sixes, each with the same firing order: 1-5-3-4-2-6. Now offset each one so you can distribute firing evenly across all six cylinder planes. Put together you get a crazy looking result: 1A-5B-3C-5A-3B-4C-3A-4B-2C...\n\nBut if we make the simple change of writing each bank on its own row things become instantly clear\n\n    A    1-    5-   3-   4-   2-   6-\n    B       5-   3-   4-   2-   6-    1-\n    C         3-   4-   2-   6-   1-    5\n\n\n(Hopefully that formatting works, on mobile!)",

Sometimes it's genius and sometimes stubborn insanity. So you have breakthroughs that are still super influential, like VTOL jets and this deltic. And the mini, with the firat traversely mounted engine. And then you have these bizarre ideas that they could never get quite practical, like hovercrafts and the Concorde and the fairey rotodyne.\n\nMy dad was a British engineer type and I was raised passively absorbing a lot of this stuff. I have very limited technical knowledge so I'm painting with a broad brush and doubtlessly getting some stuff wrong. But I maintain that British engineering has a certain unique quality. It's like pride and poetry.",

As a species we shifted priorities towards economy, including fuel, and the internet made business travel less relevant, so we retired them, but the fact that they kept flying for 34 years would imply it wasn't **that** impractical.",

Eventually, state regulators claimed that \"laboratory testing\" led them to the conclusion that Jack Daniels had distinct characteristics that a bourbon did not and allowed it to be registered as a whiskey instead.\n\nMust have been a good day to be a lab technician.",

Years of bourbon in that barrel, soaking into the the wood\n  \nAnd wine makers use them too. There's just a nice flavour from used bourbon barrels that is very useful for wines and scotch and other types of alcohol\n   \nSo many white wines these days have what's described as an \"oaky\" taste. To the point where it's kinda become a meme in the wine world, because it's getting harder to find good white wines that don't have this over-oaked taste to them. There used to be more variety but nowadays the consumer wants oaky white wine, so everyone just makes that.",

Since Bourbon requires new oak barrels and scotch requires used oak barrels it works out.  Although I think better brands stick with their own barrels from previous runs, cheaper scotch\u2019s well use barrels previously used to make bourbon or various kinds of whisky made using new oak barrels.\n\nThey also end up in various food production now a days, we see bourbon barrel aged wine, chocolate, hot sauce, maple syrup, really everything.

Any remaining gaps would vanish as the barrel swells from being filled with liquid. Of course the planks have to fit as perfectly as possible for that to work.  \nIt's very similar to how small wooden boats used to be made : if they were dry, they would initially take in a small amount of water until they were fully swelled and waterproof.",

Traditional Bordeaux barrels hold 225 liters (59 gallons) while traditional Burgundy barrels bold 228 liters (60 gallons). \n\nThey can be re-used, but they become much less valuable. Red barrels basically have 3 times of use\u2014first time they\u2019re new and give off the full amount of toast/barrel spice, second is a much more subdued toast/barrel spice, and the third they\u2019re pretty much entirely neutral. So they\u2019re good for essentially three vintages and after that they\u2019re going to be sold/scrapped often. And the going rate of a barrel at that point is about $30-50 depending on the year. New barrels range from $1000-2000 typically, so it\u2019s a steep drop off. \n\nBut there is no good substitute for nice barrels. Chips and staves work okay, but they do not impart the same level of texture, spice, etc as barrels. \n\nSo yeah, they\u2019re super expensive but important. \n\nSource: Cellar Master at a major winery.",

Currently there's one good method (aging on new barrels), one ok method (aging on chips) and one garbage tier method (using synthetic oak flavoring). \n\nI really wanted to try building what essentially amounts to an oak pipe that the wine could be pumped through at extreme pressure, with the pipe boards replaced at regular intervals. It would allow you to use different sized oak planks and move the wine much faster than allowing it to sit for a long amount of time, and would hopefully impart the same rich flavor.",

Aging is not merely the influence of oak on liquor, but a pretty complex process of a bunch of those fancy carbon compounds exchanging and changing over time. There's no real way to speed up aging. Heat cycling and agitation are probably the best way to result in a product that isn't garbage, beyond using smaller casks which can be a real double-edged sword. Aging in hot climates is the most 'natural' way that doesn't suck, but even then, there's a reason some rum etc can be 12+ years old before it's really good, even if it gets the right color and oak influence in a small fraction of that when aged in hot areas.",

But the other big rule is that it has to be at least 51% corn. \n\nInterestingly enough, Mellow Corn (which has a bit of a cult like following and has absolutely become a meme) is technically \"corn whiskey\". But if Heaven Hill (the distillery that makes mellow Corn, also: fuck heaven hill) used new oak barrels, mellow corn would be a bourbon. \n\n\nI only bring this up because when you look at it, it looks nothing like a 4 year bourbon; it many shades lighter in color.",

Something like hungarian oak in between.\n\nMost (probably like all, tbh) grocery store red wine from california never even saw the inside of a barrel.  It's cheaper to use staves and micro-ox in a large tank.  They can still label it \"oaked\".\n\nbbls can be used for about 3 lots of wine before their flavor starts to go neutral.  Then you can sell them to cheaper wineries that will still put wine in the spent barrels, but also put staves in there.  That way they still get the micro ox effect from bbl aging.\n\nFor those that use them, barrel turnover is one of the larger portions of a winery budget.",

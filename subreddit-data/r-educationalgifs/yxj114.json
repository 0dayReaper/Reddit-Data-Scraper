Introducing the various chemicals many of which are known to increase cancer risk at some concentrations to the body will increase the risk. \n\nThe short (and a bit deceptive answer) is that tattoos do increase the risk of cancer. \n\nThe actual answer is more complex as in do they increase the risk enough that it actually matters. Like if they only increase it by 1 in a billion then if the entire world got tattoos only 8 more people would get cancer. \n\nMy suspicion is a few small tattoos probably aren\u2019t going to increase the risk enough to be noticeable. A large surface area of tattoos might get to the point where the risk increase is noticeable. But relatively small numbers of people have that amount of tattoos. \n\nBut there is a legit risk that a certain chemical in tattoos does greatly increase the risk. Given the wide variety of tattoo inks and the chemicals they contain detecting that say the yellow ink by Acme manufacturer made between 1997 and 2005 because it happened to contain the chemical Cancerum(edit: this is a made up chemical to represent the many chemicals that could be in tattoo ink) and thus greatly increases the risk might be very difficult. \n\nSo in the end as a more complete accurate answer you are left with some amount of unavoidable cancer increase risk due to the basic nature of tattoos with a slight chance that depending on the chemical makeup of the ink used that it does have a much larger increase.",

Lots of things are carcinogenic and it's just up to every individual to choose their risk. If you want the absolute lowest exposure to carcinogens possible, you should not get tattooed. But you should also not get tan, or drink beer, or smoke, or hang out with people that smoke, or eat bacon, or get dental x rays, or any x rays, and some of those things have clear benefits that outweigh risk (e.g., the x rays, imo) and it's just up to every individual to decide if the benefit is worth it. I personally feel more comfortable in my skin with my tattoos, and I've seen how healing they can be for my clients too, and for me that benefit outweighs the risk! \n\nI'm definitely glad we're doing more research, but I don't think people should be losing sleep about their tattoos just yet.",

For my first 2 tattoos the longest I could sit was 4.5 hours, and that was pushing it. I did no form of prep before-hand for those. \n\nBut for my third tattoo, I was able to sit for 2 7.5 hour sessions with relative ease and could\u2019ve sat longer if needed. What I did different for the third one was for a couple of weeks prior to the tattoo I moisturized the skin of the area I was getting done so the skin would take ink easier, and on the day of the tattoo, I ate a very carb and sugar heavy breakfast, and brought sugary and salty snacks (apples, chocolate, Gatorade, cliff bars) and would periodically eat/drink even if I wasn\u2019t hungry to keep my blood sugar up before I felt like I *needed* it. \n\nThe other thing I did was listen to music or watch movies on my phone to keep my brain distracted from the pain. This one there\u2019s some debate on for etiquette. My artist preferred to just focus on his work (and English wasn\u2019t his first language) so it worked out. I know some artists like to talk with you and get to know you, which talking to your artist can help as well. Just something to distract your brain from the pain. \n\nThe prep I did, and distracting myself, which I didn\u2019t do at all the first 2 times, I just sat there and took it, made such a big difference in my ability to sit for a longer session\n\nEdit: also making sure you really get a full night\u2019s sleep. My first 2 I maybe got a few hours of sleep so my body was tired as it was. This time I went out of my way to make sure I got at least 8 hours the night before. If your body\u2019s tired from lack of sleep you\u2019re starting off behind the curve.",

This disorder causes a weird thing called Koebner phenomena where an injury to one part of the body (even a pimple) can cause you to break out in other parts of your body. Even scratching a patch of psoriasis can cause this to happen and for it to spread. \n\nI\u2019m weary about tattoos but still get them because it\u2019s worth it.",

Basically when the tattoo is done a white blood cell grabs the ink   when that cell is on his deathbed, another cell comes along and the first cell says here is my greatest possession keep it always.  The new cell goes lol k and grabs the ink\n\nThen the removal laser comes along, gives the cell a fright, it drops the ink and your bloodstream takes it away.  Your tattoo will fade faster the closer it is to your heart.\n\nSource: am getting removal done",

Which is unfortunate, because once a post gets upvoted enough the correct explanation never reaches the top. \n\n\nFor smaller ink particles right after your tattoo, yes, the white blood cells absorb them - but that's not your tattoo. Your tattoo is the remaining bigger ink particles that the immune cells decided they couldn't breakdown, in which case, they essentially setup around them and this is what makes your tattoo permanent. The ink particles get a little room for themselves with security guards wandering around sometimes wondering \"looks like they're sleeping... But I'll check again next week just in case\"",

I got tattoos before immune disorders as a thing were mainstream knowledge and in the time that's passed my family was diagnosed with a bunch of them. Now I have a couple of immune disorders. I can't say anything with certainty but I am sure that a variety of genetic and environmental factors contributed to this outcome. I definitely believe the tattoos are one environmental variable in the heap. I've had issues with them being itchy decades on and sometimes puffing up. \n\nI've thought about getting them removed but one of my conditions causes anaphylaxis at random times, so I worry that breaking the tattoo down to get carried away will activate my immune system and cause that. On the other hand, I don't really know how much keeping them is revving up my immune system. \n\nAlso, hope you start feeling better soon - sounds like you're experiencing firsthand how much science still has to discover about our immune systems. I'm right there on the edge of science with you. It's a shit place to be.",

Sorry, didn't mean to be all doom and gloom. With time, you'll figure out things that make you feel better and worse and eventually you'll reach a new normal. You might even find a couple of doctors that are helpful! \n\nAfter at least a dozen (probably two dozen) doctors that weren't helpful, I found two that were and it's made a massive difference for me. They were also able to recommend other good doctors and now I have a whole care team that's awesome. A couple of years ago I was seriously on death's door, living in a bubble and there were only four ingredients I could eat safely. For context, olive oil was one and that doubled as the only thing I could put on my skin. \n\nWhen I finally found a doctor that properly diagnosed me (before the ones that were actually helpful), I couldn't even tolerate the medications they prescribed that were supposed to stabilize me. It was the beginning of the pandemic, so they just kind of ghosted me, because they couldn't give me the level of attention I needed. Luckily, with the new diagnosis I was able to find people that specialized in those conditions and would make time for me and that's where the two good doctors came in. \n\nSo, there were many steps, but now, I live a pretty normal life - I still have a pretty restricted diet, but I go out with friends, work (even started my own business), and generally feel somewhere between 85%-99% depending on the day. I can also put tons of stuff on my skin - still have to patch test everything though. I'm still working towards full remission and it can be a bit of a roller coaster at times, but even while I'm working on that, I'm able to live a full life which I could not do a couple of years ago when I was fully disabled.\n\nThis was long but all to say - things can get better! Just finding one medical professional who has an interest and some knowledge of what you're going through plus really, really listening to your body and taking notes like you're a science experiment can make a massive difference! I'm still looking forward to the cure for immune disorders in the next few decades though lol. Really wishing you well.",

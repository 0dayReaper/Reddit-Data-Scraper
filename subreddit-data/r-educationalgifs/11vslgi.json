Everything is moving apart from everything else. There is no \"center\". The classic analogy is to draw a bunch of dots on a rubber sheet and then stretch the sheet out in all directions. All the dots move away from each other, they don't just move away from the center of the sheet. (actually the classic analogy is to draw the dots on a balloon and inflate it but I'm not interested in the inevitable turd who shows up to say \"but they're all moving away from the center of the balloon!)",

I meant to state that it's the only true non-accelerating reference frame in the universe, and made a silly faux pas in remembering my correct terminology \ud83d\ude05 I'll blame it on being ill at the moment. I've since corrected the comment. \n\nObviously reference frames are very important in physics, and we typically prefer to use non-accelerating frames when studying things. For most experiments done in a lab or similar, it's sufficient to consider the reference frame of a system at rest relative to Earth as being inertial (ie the reference frame of a \"stationary\" building for example). But in reality we know this isn't true, the Earth spins, orbits the sun, rotates around the centre of the Milky Way galaxy etc.. Strictly speaking, the only reference frame that isn't accelerating is the reference frame of the CMB.\n\nI don't mean that the CMB has an origin. I mean that you can define that itself to BE the origin, as it is literally the left over radiation of the big bang. But since the CMB is everywhere, it's evident that the origin of the universe is also everywhere. The big bang happened everywhere and it's senseless to think about it as having a centre since that requires the universe at the point of the big bang to not occupy all of space-time, which it did. Space-time didn't exist before the big bang. This is why I called it the everywhere expansion in my comment.\n\nBasically, we agree with each other (as far as I can tell).",

The Theory of Relativity states there is no independent reference frame of the Universe. All positions, velocities, etc., are in relation to another object. So you can design your time machine to place yourself at (0,0,0) with the time machine itself as the spatial reference point.\n\nIt's like, you can devise a system of Laws of Physics that assumes the Earth is the center of the Universe. Hell, the last of the astrophysicists who adhered to geocentrism almost accidentally invented the Fourier series to describe the perturbations in the planetary orbits using that model.",

I would expect that given the vast distances and you know, space numbers are big, that it would have rotated millions or billions of times in its lifetime. But, no\u2026 55. \n\nIt took 55 rotations for it to coalesce and form and distance itself 2.5m light years from the nearest galaxy.

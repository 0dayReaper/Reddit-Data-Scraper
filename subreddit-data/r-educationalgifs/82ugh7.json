Which means they will accept small errors and glitches when it comes to running games to make them run more smooth, and apply small tweaks to certain games to make them run faster and/or smoother.\n\nOn top of that, those older game developers were the masters of making parallax games which were not heavily resource intensive. Modern games now do sprawling backgrounds with way more than the normal 1-3 parallax backgrounds older console games did.\n\nFinally, if you don't properly utilize your parallax backgrounds efficiently (and don't care to tighten them up for older computers) you'll induce way more stress on the machine than what should be there. Because you test your system for a certain range of computers, and if something below that range doesn't quite crunch the numbers as efficiently, frame rates drop. Which is to be expected with modern 3D-heavy games and lower-performance computers/parts, but really makes you scratch your head when it happens in some sidescrolling game that it very well seems like it shouldn't have.\n\nThe majority of the time when this happens, though, is with an MMO, because they have better things to do than to tighten up parallax, or disable it / create settings to lower its intensity. They expect you to have frame rate drops, as you would with any modern title anyways (with lesser hardware, that is.)",

That video is actually made by the programmer who made Mickey Mania (plus Toy Story and Sonic 3D blast and others, but either way he knows what he's talking about cos he's the one who did it. The effect uses parallax scrolling but to a way more complicated level than in the main gif of this thread, and I can't quite get my head around it (it turns it on its side and adds loads of complicated shit, just watch the video), but the guy seems like an absolute genius programmer based on this and his other videos. Well, he was British and it was the 90s, were Brits led the way on good game-development, so makes sense I guess.",

There aren't a ton of things we can relate to, but if I can show him something about old Disney that he hasn't seen before - then that will make his day and mine. \n\n**Edit:** I've found out the multiplane camera is at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco.

It was mainly a \"wouldn't it be cool if\" idea to use the original rig, but alas.\n\nLittle Mermaid is also notable for utilizing some CG assistance for Eric's ship, which Clements/Musker had previously used in The Great Mouse Detective. Not full-on CG animation, but using CAD illustration to sketch out the ship's movements which was then painted over by animators. It was also the last hand-painted Disney feature before they moved over to a digital coloring and compositing system.\n\nAnother interesting fact for Little Mermaid, most of the bubble effects in the underwater scenes had to be outsourced to other studios. One was a Chinese studio, and Disney almost didn't get the animation cels back because the country was in turmoil following the Tianenmen Square incident.",

As he got older his wheezing had a tendency to screw up takes as well. It should also be noted, however, that being a smoker is what got Wyler his first break in the movie business. As a gofer at Universal Pictures in the early twenties, Wyler noticed that all of the editors were forever hanging around outside the editing building smoking. When he asked why, he was informed that nitrate film stock was highly flammable-- in those days there had to be a damn good reason why anyplace was no smoking. Wyler then rigged a thin brass tube running out the window of the editing room so that the editors might smoke without going outside. William Wyler took it upon himself to keep the ends of the tubes loaded with fresh, lit cigarettes. This got him into the editing department, which then lead to directing and three Academy Awards.  \n ",

This creates a three-dimensional effect, although it is not actually stereoscopic.\n\nVarious parts of the artwork layers are left transparent, to allow other layers to be seen behind them. The movements are calculated and photographed frame-by-frame, with the result being an illusion of depth by having several layers of artwork moving at different speeds \u2013 the further away from the camera, the slower the speed.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

It also visualizes different techniques used to write and see very small features. The following steps were used to write the features:\n\n1. The first images you see with the Molecular Foundry logo, have features only a few tens of nanometers in width. That's on the order of a few hundred atoms. In order to get features this small, a high energy electron beam was used to hit atoms in a very precise way, resulting in the tiny grooves you see.^(*)\n\n2. Next, you see a time lapse of the Berkeley Logo written using a different technique called [focused ion beam milling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focused_ion_beam). In this case gallium ions were smashed into the coin, [as shown in this diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Principe_FIB.jpg). Eventually this method traced out the Berkeley Logo.\n\n3. Finally a simple optical microscope puts the other two images in context by showing how small of an area they occupy in the coin.\n\n\\* From the source I can't quite be sure if they stripped atom directly using the electron beam or if they used the beam to strip away a resist and then etched the surface as in [electron beam lithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron-beam_lithography)\n\n___\n**Video Source:** [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oES1gpvT0I)",

                    "comment": "**Focused ion beam**\n\nFocused ion beam, also known as FIB, is a technique used particularly in the semiconductor industry, materials science and increasingly in the biological field for site-specific analysis, deposition, and ablation of materials. A FIB setup is a scientific instrument that resembles a scanning electron microscope (SEM). However, while the SEM uses a focused beam of electrons to image the sample in the chamber, a FIB setup uses a focused beam of ions instead. FIB can also be incorporated in a system with both electron and ion beam columns, allowing the same feature to be investigated using either of the beams.\n\n***\n\n**Electron-beam lithography**\n\nElectron-beam lithography (often abbreviated as e-beam lithography) is the practice of scanning a focused beam of electrons to draw custom shapes on a surface covered with an electron-sensitive film called a resist (exposing). The electron beam changes the solubility of the resist, enabling selective removal of either the exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist by immersing it in a solvent (developing). The purpose, as with photolithography, is to create very small structures in the resist that can subsequently be transferred to the substrate material, often by etching.\n\nThe primary advantage of electron-beam lithography is that it can draw custom patterns (direct-write) with sub-10 nm resolution.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

If we take this to mean that they could etch dots with 25 nanometer sides, we could encode 1s as etched dots and 0s as blank space. The surface area of one side of a penny is 285 mm^2, and 285 mm^2 divided by (25 nanometers)^2 is [4.56 * 10^11](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=((19.05+mm\\)%2F2\\)%5E2*pi+%2F+(25+nanometers\\)%5E2). Converting this number to bits yields 57.01 GB. Doubling this for two sides gets us to around 100 GB. This is ignoring the imperfections on the penny which might make writing at this resolution impossible and the extreme difficulty in reading this data.",

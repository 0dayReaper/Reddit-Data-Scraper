You cannot just slide the dots around the circles anyway you want, you also have to rotate in-place the side they're connected too. Like you you mentioned with the end, if you watch the solved yellow side all the dots actually rotate around with the other sides, they don't say in place.",

                    "comment": "This is much more confusing than a cube, because it hides the most important insight about how the cube works: that the individual squares/faces don't move independently. They are stuck together to form pieces: 8 corners (with 3 faces each), 6 centers (with 1 face each, and which never move relative to each other), and 12 edges (in between the centers, with 2 faces each). The red-blue-yellow corner is always going to move as one piece, with the red-blue-yellow faces together. You can never separate the 2 faces on the white-orange edge: they are part of one single piece. So you will never have an edge piece with 2 white faces, for example, or even with a white face and a yellow face (because white and yellow are on opposite sides of the cube, so no single piece can ever share those colors).\n\nAll of this is apparent when you play around with an actual cube for a few seconds, but this 2D representation gives the impression that all of the individual stickers/faces are moving independently. This makes it much harder to see how everything is related.\n\nVisual explanation in this video: https://youtu.be/75nsEa9ttPg?t=70",

Until things start to make sense, you recognize some patterns, you start to be able to move foward.\n\nThe first time I solved it, I wasn't sure how (meaning how did I do the last step, all before that was already known for me). However, I kept trying and soon after I was able to solve it every time.\n\nI still solve it every day, with the same method I found.\n\nEverytime I solve it, is almost exactly the same steps. Little variations.\n\nHowever, as I said in other comment, this method is not fast (around 2 minutes every time). I know there are better options, but I don't know if I will be able to find those myself without any instructions.\n\nFor me it wasn't about being fast, but about solving it myself, without any help.

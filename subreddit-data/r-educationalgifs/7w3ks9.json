Then they start losing the kinesthetic awareness to hip hinge and end up never, ever stressing the lower back at all. This is bad. Because then the lower back doesn't get stronger, it gets weaker and more injury prone. Bending over to pick something up is fine and beneficial for the back, as long as it's held in a neutral position throughout lifting, and not a flexed position (which will put pressure on the discs).",

First, think of it in terms of 2 very separate topics.\n\n1 - Reducing workload, making it as easy as possible for yourself &amp; optimize body usage. \n\nFor this. What the OP gif showed is very good for you (with physics showing why it's easier). \n\n2 - Exercise your muscles so they become stronger, and well trained muscles are less likely to be injured, especially under load. \n\nComment OP is saying that while it's nice and easy for a person to do this for saving effort, it may not be the best in the long run if you ever gotta do hard work (or even just for body building / health training). As mid-lower back muscles are not only one of the strongest muscle we have but also could be leveraged (and used) in many many different life activities. So if you neglect this muscle for too long, it can become highly injury prone.\n\nThus, when possible, you should seek to train your back, but with proper form. For details look up deadlift. The reddit post OP gif started at a position that's easy to deadlift, but where it goes fcked is when the muscles (well it didn't have any..) did not maintain a neutral spine and back position. It should be flat. \n\nI would go even further to say the most important part people need to know are the proper forms of movements and muscle usage, rather than learning \"this one special trick to save you\". While squatting may be technically easier, you can still fck up squatting if your forms are bad, such as tip-toeing, hunch-backing, center of gravity too far in front or back, or other bad forms. \n\nHope that makes it clearer for you.",

If you are going to deadlift, the item should either be right in front of your shins or right between your feet (for a sumo deadlift). \n\nEven if you have a neutral spine, lifting something so far in front of you puts needless pressure on your lower back. \n\nOf course, not maintaining a neutral spine will mess you up no matter where the load is.

Do you need to lift with your legs for everything definitely not.\n\nToo much disinformation in our social conscious feeds myths and fears about backs which leads to maladaptive development and poorer outcomes when recovering from injury.\n\nBe nice to your back, keep it happy and strong, listen to it and look after it, but don't fear it.

The idea is that as the universe expands it cools, but it is still insanely hot - hot enough that it is just a mess of protons, neutrons, electrons and positrons, and neutrinos (and photons and dark matter particles, probably, but we can ignore those for now). The thing is, at sufficiently high densities and temperatures a positron and a neutron, or a neutron and an electron neutrino, can form a proton (and a positron / electron), and vice versa. But! That only works if it is insanely hot. Expand the universe a bit - and cool it - and the neutron formation slows down. Unbound neutrons aren't stable, they decay (into a proton and an electron). So, if you want to make any elements other than hydrogen, it needs to be cool enough (relatively speaking) that they're not immediately destroyed but hot enough for the fusion reactions to actually happen. So there's a limited amount of time during which free neutrons exist, but still meet protons at high enough densities to form things like deuterium and tritium, and eventually helium (which is stable, so it sticks around).  \n\nThis is important because it gives us a prediction for how much helium relative to hydrogen one would expect given only the current density and expansion rate of the universe, and it's very testable (if you look at stars that are very old). It turns out the predictions match pretty well, with helium making up about 25% of the gas mass of the universe.  \n\nAs a final fun fact, this idea was first proposed by a guy called Ralph Alpher and his PhD advisor, George Gamov. When they wrote the article they decided it would be funny to ask Hans Bethe to join, leading to what is now called \"the Alpher-Bethe-Gamov paper\", a pun so terrible that generations of astrophysicists have attempted to beat it.",

The scales of everything is *way* off, if you could see the heliosphere like that, the sun would be some tiny dot and none of the planets would be visible. Nor their trajectory either. Also the solar system advances quite heavily tilted, 63\u00b0 relative to its plane around the galaxy. Here its plane is aligned with the way it moves forward, for some reason.",

There's guaranteed (as much as anything can be) to be life out there.\n\nWhat really grinds my gears is the probability of intelligent life. We know far, far less about that than the probability of life itself emerging.\n\nDinosaurs ruled the Earth for ~150-170 million years. Think about that. Humans have done so for 7,000-50,000 years. I can list that entire range of theory, despite it being so vastly different, because the discrepancy is infinitesimal compared to the time of the Dinosaurs. Our time on this planet is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the time Dinosaurs dominated life on Earth.\n\nOnce Dinos were established and an equilibrium is reached, there's no selective pressure for intelligent life to emerge and flourish. It took an extinction event for us.\n\nSo then you're left to wonder, how common is intelligent life? Because it is compounded directly in the denominator of your stated probability. Regardless of whether life happens on 1/10000 stars or 1/10000000 stars, that probability is exponentially sensitive to the probability of intelligent life.\n\nIn the most conservative, and almost guaranteed to be wildly inaccurate (an underestimate) There's ~125 **billion** galaxies in our little ole universe, each with an average of ~100 million stars. That's a lot of chances for life. Even if there was only life on average of one planet per galaxy, there's still hundreds of billions of planets with life out there, and that's being as conservative as is entirely reasonable. But intelligent life? We don't have any idea about the probability of intelligent life emerging from life.\n\nIt's a fun question. Oh, and as an aside, when I say those are the \"most conservative\" figures for galaxy/star amounts, I'm talking ridiculously conservative. Other estimates are talking trillions of galaxies with billions of stars per galaxy. Most people can't even really conceptualize numbers in that magnitude, so the whole \"is life out there\" becomes a bit meaningless, as is the reason of why we likely won't ever encounter it (the distances in space being even more unfathomable, more impossible to conceptualize than even the amount of stars/galaxies in our universe).",

Rather, we're constantly moving in a sort of [DNA helix shape](https://youtu.be/0jHsq36_NTU?t=11) around the sun as we move alongside the forward momentum of the sun's orbit. Never being left behind, and forever beyond pulled at the absolutely mind-numbing speeds through space that we are *currently traveling at right this very moment while somehow by the grace of gravity never coming in contact with any other planet, yet dancing in a perfectly harmonious choreography with these other massive hunks of rock that could fucking obliterate us if we came within just a few tens of thousands of miles of their orbits*. \n\nFucking hell.

But if it's atmosphere then it'd extend behind the solar system as it moves, like you said (it'd also get pushed by the radiation from the galactic core since many of those atmospheric particles are charged).",

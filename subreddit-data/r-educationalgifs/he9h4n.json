Outside temp only affects the systems efficiency. \n\nThe system is designed to transfer energy from home to outside and depending on where you live that system could be a heat pump variation which both heats and cools your home depending on its needs. The transfer of energy is handled by varying types of refrigerants with R-22 being the most common type however it is being phased out for a more environmentally friendly type called R-410A. \n\n The system utilizes low pressure and high pressure refrigerant to achieve the transfer of energy. There are two sides to an AC system that make the magic be magical. One side of the system will be low pressure and uses an \"Evaporator\" coil or \"A-Coil\" to cool the home. The other side is the high pressure side which dumps off the excess heat in the refrigerant and uses a \"Condensor\", the metal thing with a big fan outside the house, to do it. \n\nFor more information regarding AC systems I will provide the following link to a great video that details the inner workings much better than I can: https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ\n\nSource: Ex-HVAC Technician",

The concrete would probably absorb a lot of the heat, and the sustained heat to heat up the entire structure might not be there. \n\nThere's a bunch of factors here, I'd love to see it tested, actually.\n\nEarthquakes though... that's a big one, I could imagine that house collapsing like a mousetrap, like \\*splat\\*.",

I don't know how it would do in a forest fire, but it's probably better than a traditional wood framed home. Of course the fire would probably still get into the house through windows and doors.\n\nAnd for earthquakes, concrete can easily be designed to resist those forces.",

I open up all the doors and windows to get the home down to about 65 degrees at night, then shut it all when the sun rises. On 100+ degree days, by sundown the indoor temp is around 80.  I haven't done the math, but I suspect if it get to 80 when it is 100 degrees outside, it will get fatal when it is 1500 degrees outside.\n\nOf course, I don't live in a forest either, so the grass fire that would sweep by my house probably would not be a huge concern.",

A concrete roof might take less damage just some cracking. Where a wood roof completely gets wiped out, but what's the cost difference in initial construction and repairs to the roof, I can't imagine its justified.\n\nNormal concrete is not that resistant to fire that if a forest fire engulfs your home it might not burn, but instead completely collapse because beyond 300C or 400C concrete loses a lot of it's strength and forest fires get much hotter than that. Obviously concrete can be used in high heat applications but it's mix is specially designed for those specific applications. \n\nIn a flood or tsunami because concrete is heavy you can get scouring around the base of the structure which can lead to the home completely flipping over or sinking like your feet in the sand at the beach. But again a traditional house might be completely wiped out.",

I know what you're thinking \"but old concrete is harsh on the environment!\" it's around this time that big concrete starts releasing studies saying that the old studies were flawed and probably came from communist scientists anyway so fuck em. Sprinkle in a little lobbying and some child sex rings and boom. You got a big concrete conspiracy stew going.\n\nIf someone wants to copy that and throw in some antisemitism they'll probably make you a mod over at r/conspiracy",

Also the air gets really cold here so the tiny air pockets in concrete freeze and break the concrete. Wood doesnt break when its cold. You can make concrete not crack by cold by making the air pockets tiny, but that's expensive. I hope this little EL5 was ok. For example, people say \"how come we can't make concrete like the romans did, the Colosseum is standing?!?\" my professional reply is \"ya well it doesn't snow in Rome\"",

There are countless homes in the upper northeast region of the US that are 150+ years old.\n\nMost only get torn down only because people put newer bigger homes on the lots.\n\nDuring demolition it is easy to get surprised on the quality of lumber in the homes from back then. Hell, even 50 years ago homes were built with much higher quality lumber. Building codes have pushed contractors towards consistently safe homes rather than completely random acts of construction that could look good at first and made with good materials but be unsafe. \n\nThis ICF stuff seems neat though.",

Not a random dude with a shovel mixing some quickcrete\n\n- you have to vibrate it for it to settle to remove air pockets and smooth the wall....with a concrete vibrator....\n\n- you have to face the wall with stucco or other to avoid water in the cracks during frost\n\n- you have to add plenty of steel\n\n- you have to take expansion/contraction into account during frost cycles and build in expansion joints\n\n- you have to properly cure the concrete (cover and wait in the right temp).\n\n\n\nThe upside is that the concrete house, if properly maintained, will last forever.  No termites.  No dry rot.  Not weather damage.\n\nThe downside is that all of the steps above make it prohibitively expensive over just tossing up some wooden sticks.\n\n\n\nImportant to note that the house in the video didnt seem to take any precautions.

So they threw up the fastest, cheapest things they could to meet the immediate demand.\n\nThen after the immediate need passed and people were housed, they started reconstructing the economy and people with money wanted to get out of the 'ghetto' housing and into something newly built.  The mentality became that an old house is a bad house.  When you know that the person buying your house when you sell it will assume it is crap and tear it down (because it's not new) then you don't invest in keeping it nice.  It's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nI've heard that being an architect in Japan is the dream because everyone wants custom built homes designed to last one generation.  You don't worry about making something other people will like or 'resale value' because it's going to be scrapped in 20 years anyway.  So people are pretty liberal with the weird and wonderful things that they want leading to architects being allowed to stretch their creative muscles. \n\nAll this is hearsay, so don't take my word for it.",

Maybe some very specific areas do this on occasion, but most european, or rather west/central european countries, build their walls with lime sandsone or special concrete blocks, an insulating layer (regional differences) and whatever comes outside for the looks. Reinforced concrete is rarely used in regular houses except for basement, ceilings and some specific carrying parts. Also regional differences tho, some countries still commonly used wooden ceilings and some are even using brick/special blocks for the basement.",

It'd also be much easier to retrofit existing homes. Hell, outfitting a home with a full kevlar flack jacket probably is similar in cost to concrete in many places in the US (about $6/sq ft) without hardly as many of the disadvantages.\n\nConcrete homes suck - they're too conductive to heat (1.4W/m-K, vs about 0.6 for foam board insulated brick as currently installed in the US) and the material itself has a high thermal capacity (about 1000J/kg-K, vs 800 for brick) meaning it just plain costs more energy to warm and cool a concrete space. (Wood's thermal capacity is even higher thanks to water content, but its conductivity is much poorer at between 0.15 and 0.2W/m-K, and is usually filled with insulation so overall numbers are much better on average; a lot of research and money being spent on home construction right now is targeting thermal bridges created by stick-built wood homes.)\n\nIt's one of the many reasons commercial projects all the way up to skyscrapers try to stay away from concrete as much as they can, usually only doing floors (and now even just floating concrete over metal floors) and fire safety staircases as code requires. Worse, concrete is inflexible for the owner - something as simple as moving an outlet or repairing a burst pipe can mean jackhammering or concrete saws.\n\nICFs are better than cast concrete, but not a whole lot, and you're losing some of the structural integrity you had hoped to gain with concrete. But, it's also cheap since ICFs can and are mass produced and have a much better insulating factor thanks to the inclusion of styrofoam on both sides of the panel. But, better still seems to be SIP - wood sandwiching a styrofoam core which can also be built offsite, are lighter so transit costs are less, and are better insulating reducing the energy spent on the home's lifetime.",

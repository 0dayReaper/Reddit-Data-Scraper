These rates of extinction are as fast, or faster, than those in the past five mass extinction events. In this sense we are living through a mass extinction event.\"   \n\n\nI'm sure theres other sources that could back it up, though I cant be arsed to find them now.",

The included extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods. With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna, starting at the end of the last Ice Age.\n\n***\n\n^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)",

Although it was a mass extinction nonetheless.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the wikipedia article's discussion includes some debate over whether the oxygen actually caused species to die off and several people claim that those statements of extinction due to oxygen are dubious. That is what I had always heard and I figured that is why this event is also called things like \"The Great Oxygen Catastrophe\". Hard to call it a catastrophe if it didn't actually kill a lot of species. Maybe there is some new evidence suggesting the appearance of oxygen simply coincided with the die-off and wasn't the cause. I'm not sure, and I can't fully make sense of it based on what the article and discussion says. I'd love to know the current scientific consensus on it if anyone knows.",

What they think had the biggest impact on this particular extinction were \"[the Deccan traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps)\" (current place: Deccan Plateau), which were just these enormous lava fluxes coming from underneath the ground on the area of around half of what India today is. They released lots of poisonous and possibly climate changing gasses that they were probably the most cancerous thing to all the animals back then.",

But there will still assuredly be at least one more mass extinction from *some* cause. Arguably it's already happening, due to the changes to our climate wrought by human industry. Even if that's incorrect or we manage to escape it, Earth itself will not last forever. Any life remaining at the time of the Sun's eventual expansion will be utterly exterminated by that event.",

There was a documentary I saw in like 2007 called How The Earth Was Made the took you through the birth of the planet, creation of life, and how it shaped to become what it is today, including all those extinction events. Blew my mind back then lol. \nEdit: [I think this is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GiW5Ndu5gg&amp;list=PL8e-1gsTIza4aemQFO9GocJe2HZyQtwo1&amp;index=8&amp;t=0s) But the sound sucks and is only a quarter of the screen with weird graphics.",

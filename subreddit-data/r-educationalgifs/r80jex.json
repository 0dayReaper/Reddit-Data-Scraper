This is a mp4 file so 24fps, with that we can calculate its traveling 100.57in per second. Convert that to mph and we end up with 5.713 miles per hour. Of course this assumes your 3 frames or 0.125 seconds to spin are correct.\n\nEdit I was bored, so I broke it up frame by frame, it is indeed 3 frames.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/Bp8Kz0H.jpg",

It looks like if the frame was straight rather than a spiral, all the flat sides of the gears would be parallel and in contact so the entire thing would run instantly. But the spiral causes gears toward the inside to have to rotate further before making contact with the flat part of the next gear, causing some gears to appear to run slower/faster than others. \n\nThat\u2019s my guess anyway.",

That last rotation creates a very natural sound for the size/material/speed of those gears whereas the others have a clear modulation to them",

Watch the slow-mo'd round at the end and you'll see it looks remarkably more \"natural\" and less glitch-like because it doesn't have this weirdly placed cut. Still amazing, but that glitch-y look is at least in some part due to the cuts.\n\nEDIT: Reviewing this further maybe it's actually not a cut even if it looks like one. It might be a sort-of 'backwards' propagation of the last gear which causes a small jump of the red gear, one that's *so* small due to the effect of the gear ratios. It's literally so fast that if you look for it by slowing the gif down to .5 or .25 speed as I initially did you still can't see it and it looks like 1 or 2 missing frames, but if you go below .1 speed you can make it out. Pretty amazing.",

If one of them is increasing exponentially (as in any logarithmic spiral), then the other cannot be the same shape, because they won't touch when they're both halfway turned. For them to be the same shape, the increase in radius must be symmetric (probably linear). So I bet they can't be true logarithmic spirals at all.\n\nFor example, a logarithmic spiral with a starting radius of 1 that increases to a radius of 2 in one cycle must have a radius of \u221a2 = 1.414 at the 180 degree point. But if the gears touch when the radius of 1 touches the other's radius of 2, then the distance between them must be 3, so when turned to their midpoints there would be a gap of (3-2\u221a2) = 0.172. For a golden spiral, the same principle applies, just with distances of 1, \u03c6^2, and \u03c6^4 instead, which actually increases the gap you would get at the halfway point.\n\nSo honestly, I think they're all just repeating what they've heard, because we have such a strong (yet mostly incorrect) \"the golden spiral is everywhere\" belief in our culture.",

Chief among them is that the gears are not initially engaged in (what I\u2019m calling) the initial or parallel position. [Here\u2019s what that position looks like](https://i.imgur.com/CvtpgwZ.jpg). \n\nIf we rotate one of the gears just a few degrees \u2013 enough for the first tooth to lock \u2013 [you can see that the other gear has actually rotated about 3x further](https://i.imgur.com/yBip0Hm.jpg). The top gear, `r1`, with the smaller radius makes up for it\u2019s lack of logarithmic growth by rotating further, allowing it to keep up with the bigger logarithmic decline of `r2` so that  `d` remains constant. \n\nAs a result, I think these *could* actually be logarithmic spirals. The 90\u00b0 cut and tapered teeth near that cut allow for some hidden movement as the gears rotate away from the parallel position and again when returning to it.",

For example if you pause it in the middle of a rotation and just move yellow to line up with the flat edge of orange, that position should be valid to build in a different direction.\n\nBut even then the overall shape is arbitrary to the number of gears used. Too few and the effect wouldn't be as cool, too many and the materials might fail, but overall it was intentional to mimic the shape this way.",

But a couple of general corrections/clarifications:\n\nThe speed at which atoms transmit force within a medium is defined and (as you mention) is less than C. However it is SO significantly less than C that we give it it\u2019s own measurement, the speed of sound. \n\nRemember, sound isn\u2019t a particle that moves from location to another. It\u2019s one particle moving forward and backward, imparting that momentum to the next particle, which imparts it to the next one, etc\u2026 just like a newtons cradle. \n\nInteraction between materials happen at the atomic level not the sub-atomic. \n\nThere are some very specific circumstances whereby photons can apply a force on an object, but even then, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the photon applying kinetic force as much as it is the increased energy that the photon imparts causes changes to the electron orbit, when can then destabilize the atom forcing it to release an amount of energy equal to the energy originally provided to it and emitting a brand new photon as a result. All that being said, photons are not considered within classical materials science. \n\nSo, the twist you would see, assuming it were possible to setup such an experiment, would happen at the speed of sound.",

I never thought about how the speed of sound is the fastest a material can transmit information but that makes sense.\n\nThat also explains why the speed of sound can be so much higher in rigid materials than in gases.\n\nAs to photons applying force, the topic is confusing because there\u2019s so many different frequencies of photons that do different kinds of work. I\u2019m constantly trying to learn more so excuse my gaps in knowledge. But the photons I was referring to were the ones that mediate magnetic fields that allow matter to interact with each other. If it wasn\u2019t for photons, atoms would just pass right through one another.\n\nI\u2019m not incredibly familiar with the photon momentum equation so I can\u2019t speak as to why photons can produce kinetic energy but I seem to remember something about an energy difference between the front and back of the material being struck by the photon.\n\nGonna have to dive back into physics for a bit to bulk up my understanding of photons. Stupid dual nature quasiparticles. So fascinating but so counterintuitive.\n\nThe delayed quantum erasure experiment, the speed of light propagation through different mediums, and multiple polarized filters at different angles all point to the same nature of how light behaves but I really struggle with identifying what exactly is the core of those phenomenon.\n\nIt looks like the path of light is predetermined but I think that\u2019s just a misconception of my understanding of photons as a particle.

The energy required to hit 100% speed of light is infinite if there is mass.    \n\nSo as a thought experiment, lets try to get 99% of the speed of light and assume that that the gear weighs 10 grams.\n\nE=(\u03b3\u22121)mc^2\nwhere m is .010kg and c is speed of light\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / [sqrt(1-(v^2 / c^2 ))] where v is the 99% speed of light and c is 100% speed of light.  This is called \"gamma\"  See that if you have a v = 100%, you have 1 / sqrt[(1 - (1/1)] becomes 1 / sqrt[1-1] becomes 1 / 0.  1/0 is u\u0334\u0362\u0489\u0340\u035e\u0323\u032c\u033c\u0330\u033c\u034e\u0316\u033a\u032b\u0356\u033b\u032f\u0354\u0323\u0349n\u0361\u0340\u0489\u034f\u0333\u0355\u031c\u0347\u032a\u0318\u0339\u032c\u0345d\u0336\u0315\u0321\u035f\u033a\u0348\u0326\u033a\u0331\u0348\u032f\u0320\u031ce\u0321\u0334\u0321\u0358\u031e\u033a\u0319\u0326\u032c\u032f\u0359\u0318\u0329\u0339\u032e\u031f\u0319f\u0315\u0315\u0361\u032a\u032f\u032f\u0317\u032ci\u031b\u035e\u0340\u0327\u031f\u032d\u0330\u033c\u034en\u0361\u034f\u0359\u031c\u0354\u032c\u0317\u0320e\u034f\u0339\u0324\u0347\u0324\u0330\u0354d\u0336\u0328\u0323\u0323\u034d\u0355\u031e\u0333\u0319\u0348\u0319\u031c\n\n*math*\n\nE= 5.0378mc^2 = (5.0378) * (0.010) * (2.98*10^8 m/s)^2 ==  4.4738 *10^15 Joules of energy.  \n\n44 737 800 000 000 000 Joules is probably not going to budge when you crank it, and bear in mind this is just the energy required for the _last_ gear.

If you place a wide gear and a narrow gear on the same axis, you'll note that for a single turn the wider one turned more teeth than the smaller one. If you mesh the wider one to a smaller gear, it will turn the smaller gear many times for one of its turns, and thus the smaller gear will spin faster. The reverse is also true, small to large will slow it down (but increase torque).\n\nThe arrangement here lets each gear act as both a larger and smaller gear, each gear it goes through it speeds up by a factor of x% of the previous, **not** a single set speed, so let's say it doubles in speed, for 15 gears that means the last would be moving 32,000x faster than the first gear. Even at a mere 50% increase the last will move 440x the speed of the first.",

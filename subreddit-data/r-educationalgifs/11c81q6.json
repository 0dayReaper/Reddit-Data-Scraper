Being a reptile zookeeper, our head vet explained to me that \n\nMammal brains trigger the 'breathe' urge when it senses a buildup of CO2 in the blood. The brain doesn't actually monitor O2 levels, cuz if there's low CO2 the brain just assumes there's high O2.\n\nBut some animal brains, like reptiles, actually send the 'breathe' cue due to lack of 02. And after anesthesia, this makes them harder to get breathing again. As if the breathing machine did too good and oxygenated the blood too well, reptiles will just lay there, no breathing, cuz the brain senses all the O2, and will allow the buildup of CO2, even to problematic levels.",

Apparently you feel fine because there\u2019s no co2 build it\u2026 but you\u2019re not getting any o2 either because the evaporating n2 displaces it. So you just don\u2019t realize anything is wrong until you start feeling more and more confused... and hopefully connect the dots. Pretty crazy stuff, I found it so interesting.",

Is it still based on CO2 levels ?  then why in this case are the high levels of CO2 concentration (indicating lack of O2) triggering the command, but not in the case where you breath Nitrogen. Why does the CO2 level increases when I stop breathing, but not when I breath Nitrogen ?\n\nIs it because, in the case of nitrogen I'm still breathing, hence I am still exhaling CO2 so its concentration in blood doesn't increase as much as when I stop breathing completely ?",

That means your blood's CO2 levels don't build up and your body doesn't realize what's happening.\n\nWhen you're holding you're breath you're not exhaling CO2, so the CO2 levels build up and you get the urge to take a breath.",

This is why tibetians and Nepalese have the famous scarlet rosy cheeks, from high rbc. \n\nThis effect is reversed once you're back to sea level after a few months. Even if you're a peru native in the mountains, the body will reduce rbc when at sea lvl after while\n\nThe only people who have permanently high rbc count are the Nepalese sherpas, who usually help other folks climb Mount everest.\n\nIt's one of the most recent *evolutionary* divergence within humans due to external pressure that we can notice.",

When someone comes in with bad COPD you have to be careful about how much O2 you give them cause too much and they'll lose that respiratory drive and stop breathing.\n\nAt least that's the theory, I haven't seen it happen yet",

During exhalation, the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles relax, and the air is forced out of the lungs. The human chest cavity is always at a lower pressure than the outside environment (usually 760mmHg at sea level).\n\nBirds have air sacs that store and pump air through the stationary lungs. Unlike in mammals, air flows in only one direction through bird lungs. With the help of air sacs, this allows birds to take in oxygen even during exhalation. Birds can breathe at much higher elevations than mammals because of their more efficient lung structure.\n\nInsects have no lungs and do not use their circulatory system to move oxygen. They transport air directly to tissue cells using tracheal tubes. Grasshoppers use different breathing methods when they are resting, alert, hopping, or flying. The alert grasshopper shown here is pumping its abdomen to chNge the volume of its air sacs. This helps pump air through the trachea.",

Air would never move into the lungs if they were always below ambient pressure.\n\n&gt; Air moves in and out of the\u00a0lungs\u00a0in response to differences in pressure. When the air pressure within the alveolar spaces falls below atmospheric pressure, air enters the lungs (inspiration), provided the\u00a0larynx\u00a0is open; when the air pressure within the alveoli exceeds atmospheric pressure, air is blown from the lungs (expiration). The flow of air is rapid or slow in proportion to the magnitude of the pressure difference. Because atmospheric pressure remains relatively constant, flow is determined by how much above or below atmospheric pressure the pressure within the lungs rises or falls.\n\n-Encyclopedia Brittanica",

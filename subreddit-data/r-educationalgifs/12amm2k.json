That is self evident when the slinky is held up, but it's not totally obvious why the spring force remains constant as the top part is released, but on the other end their is no good reason why it should vary until the slinky has fully collapsed.\n\nOr something.",

So the bottom part can't experience any change in forces until the top part slams into it.\nThis wouldn't work with a shorter slinky (since the top part would not have enough time to catch up with the speed of the disturbance) or on the moon where the gravity acceleration is too low. Also it can't work with a rigid body of reasonable length, since the speed of push in those is their internal speed of sound, which is way too fast.",

It must have something to do with spring part, which maybe associated with the transmission of energy. I imagine what if the slinky is placed horizontally and both ends are held up until one end is released.",

Weaker spring wouldn't have enough to resist gravity and the whole thing would just fall more in sync? Or does being in a free hanging position mean it has enough force to hold itself up therefore it's counteracting gravity? That's where my brain starts hurting... But my gut is saying this will happen with any free hanging spring, anything that *can* impart force balanced around the center of mass? With the variables being how long that process takes and what distance it occurs over?",

Which is a character of the material mainly, though I am sure there are other factors that come in to play like the shape and size of the metal in the spring. \n\nAt any rate, this doesn\u2019t affect how quickly the spring falls\u2026 this is simply a matter of kinetics. The spring\u2019s center of mass begins falling instantly even though the bottom is stationary the top is still moving. You can see that once the tension in the spring is released the whole thing appears to slow down. But what is happening is that more mass is moving slower because the total acceleration remains the same, which is gravity.",

When both ends are released, a force acts on both ends pulling them together where they meet in the middle.\n\n2- now imagine that this same stretched out spring, when released, you have a force acting on one of the ends, pushing against the direction that it wants to contract. In this case one of the ends is staying still, because there is a force pushing against the natural force of the contraction of the spring, and the other end is contracting towards the end that the force is acting on.\n\n3: now imagine that this is happening vertically. Gravity is a force that is pulling both ends down, and the spring is naturally pulling each end towards each other.\n\nThe bottom of the spring has gravity pulling it down, and the spring energy pulling it up in equal amounts, so it is stationary. The top of the spring has both gravity and spring energy pulling it down, so it is falling twice as fast as it would do if it was just gravity acting on it.\n\nThis is why when the spring is fully contracted it appears to fall slower than the top end did when it was stretched out.",

Another way of thinking of it is the bottom doesn't \"know\" it's been dropped until the rest of the spring can retract into it at the speed of wave propagation through the slinky. Still impresses me along with how a tiny bubble can destroy a wine cask if it floats from near the bottom to the top and no other bubbles can absorb the change in pressure.",

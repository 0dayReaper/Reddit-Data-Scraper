            "comment": "Saw a video like this, not this one in particular, and it saved my life and my dog's life, well, she would have lived either way.  My dog chased a duck out onto the middle of a frozen pond.  The ice was thin though.  She weighs about sixty pounds.  She fell through about fifty feet from the shore and was treading water.  We were in the middle of the woods, so by the time any help would have arrived (had I called), she would have been a dogsicle.  I figured I could belly crawl out to her and pull her up onto the ice.  Since I'd be getting a little wet from the ice, I decided to leave my jacket and phone on the shore, so I'd have a warm dry jacket.  I made it to the dog but when I grabbed her collar, she pulled me in.  I could touch muddy bottom without going under, but barely.  I threw the dog onto the ice and was left alone with my thoughts for a bit.\nI tried pulling myself up, but that didn't work at all.  Then I thought about somebody finding my frozen corpse in the pond and how lame that would be.  I also thought about how I didn't call for help and how I left my phone 50 feet away.  Then I remembered the video.  Shit worked, I basically swam onto the ice and crawled back to shore.  One of the many times I've stupidly almost died.\n\n\n",

Not that you can go back in time to test it, but just wondering if you tried other techniques than crawling?",

He was a navy man from his late teens until his retirement, so he knows a thing or two about the sea. \n\nAnyway, he told me that if one falls into freezing water the first thing one should do is to get out of the water, the second thing is to remove all wet clothes, because that will increase the time to survive before freezing to death and thereby increase ones chances of rescue. As I looked around I saw nothing but small, rocky islands that would offer no protection against the elements and I thought about how I would have to swim to one of those islands and take off all clothes and hope to be rescued in time if the boat would sink. \n\nI guess I hadn't realized just how dangerous the sea could be until that point, but the way he told me it was all about increasing the chances of being rescued really made it clear that cold water is nothing to screw around with.

Fully wet clothing drains heat out of your skin at an unbelievable rate, whereas being naked will feel absolutely brutally uncomfortable, but bleeds considerably less heat - and allows you to move at full speed. \n\nIf you're less than a minute or more than a few minutes away from being indoors, don't take this advice though. \n\nIf you're more than 5 minutes from dry clothes, but you're in a snowy area, immediately take off your outer-layer and roll in the snow. It's a really good insulator. ",

We both panic and desperately try to get out, the ice continually breaking around us, and were both becoming increasingly terrified we wont get out of this.  Somehow we both manage to calm ourselves down enough to slowly work our way out of the water and crawl off the pond.\n\nAfter we got inside we looked out at the pond and realized that if we turned around 180 degrees after falling in, we couldve easily walked out, with no struggle.

                    "comment": "Actually, if you remember a few things, you'll never fall through the ice. \n\n1st off, remember the code of the ice (Thanks, Futurama!):\n\n\"Thick and blue, tried and true\n\nThin and crispy, way too risky\"\n\nIt's a silly rhyme, but it's useful for remembering what thin ice looks and sounds like. Believe it or not, you don't need much ice to walk on. 3 inches is actually thick enough for ice hockey. There's also some rules for ice activities and a prediction method for determining thickness of the ice, which is explained [here!](http://lakeice.squarespace.com/ice-growth/). \n\nAn easier way to figure out ice thickness that doesn't use math is to call a local bait or fishing shop, or you can check ice thickness yourself with a number of methods - use a metal tipped spear to dig through the ice and a tape measure to check for thickness. A cordless drill works as well. Make a hole. When water rushes up, you've drilled through. An ice auger works too.\n\n\nThese are the general guidelines for ice thickness:\n\nUnder 4\" - STAY OFF - (if it's a shallow pond, 3\" is OK for hockey. If someone falls in, they'll just have cold feet and wet skates *edit* though I did know a guy who fell through and almost drowned himself in 4 inches of water. The dude just panicked. All he had to do was stand up, but he just flopped like a fish. The whole hockey team was laughing at him)\n\n4\" - Ice fishing or other activities on foot\n\n\n5\" - 7\" - Snowmobile or ATV\n\n\n8\" - 12\" - Car or small pickup\n\n\n12\" - 15\" - Medium truck\n\nTL;DR: Pro tip - knowing the thickness of the ice and adhering to safety guidelines decreases the odds of falling through ice by a large percentage!",

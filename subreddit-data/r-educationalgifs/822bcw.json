I make just as much as a guy flipping burgers at McDonalds with a lot more stress and responsibility. I'm the guy who makes sure the instruments they use on you are clean, sterile, and working correctly. Nothing like being questioned by JCAHO for several hours to make you shit your underwear. I've seen them start cases using a robot only to have something unexpected happen causing the surgeon to open the person up in a more traditional manner. The Robot is a tool and it will never replaced a well trained, skilled surgeon. Also, these things can be a bitch to clean as the IFU's can change depending on what type of arms are being processed. The scopes are a piece of cake until you see the Scrub techs roll in a case cart with the scopes outside their protective case laying under a major set of instruments.",

It's a double stacked tray with basically all essential instrumentation. \n\nLoaner trays are usually the worst offenders, the ones for total joints and spine. We weighed one in at 47 lb. It's not always SPD's fault, though... In my facility they process thousands of trays per day for every department. They're understaffed, overworked, and the turnover is ridiculous. All the old timers were replaced with \"certified\" SPD techs fresh out of school that have zero idea what goes on in the OR, causing a major disconnect between the departments.\n\nThis is in a major regional trauma center.

The vision system is 3D so you have full depth perception and the hand/finger movements are really nicely mapped to the robotics. The task we had was applying tiny rubber bands around silicone \"fingers\", but it was all really small. Small enough that it would have been impossible without tweezers in each hand, and tough even then, but I was able to master it after just 30 seconds.  It was cool to remove your head from the headset and look at the actual miniscule work you were doing. But from inside the headset everything looked giant!",

A button that blows up the world when pressed might be classified 'safe', while a housecat that switches places with another housecat randomly in the world, and has no other anomalous effects, would be classified 'keter'. A good way of thinking about it is the box test\n\n* If you put the SCP in a box and it stays there, it's safe. \n* If you put the SCP in a box and it will get out or destroy itself unless you poke it or feed or or whatever, it's euclid. \n* If you put it in the box, and later when you check the box is empty, it's probably keter (make sure it's not just invisible)\n\nAn object can also be euclid or keter if its effects aren't stopped by being in the box, depending on how hard it is to contain it or it's effects otherwise. \nSCP-212 doesn't do anything unless it's approached; So, its classified safe. \n ",

The machine itself is crazy expensive but since it gives the user WAY WAY WAY more control compared with the more popularly used laproscopics so patients get to go home quicker. It allows doctors to not touch around what they dont need to touch around. Patients are in less pain, don't stay in the hospital as long, and the hospital loses less money. \n\nI had the privilege of testing one out with styrofoam when I was doing my surgical rotation. With laproscopics, you have one camera so it feels like you are operating in a 2D field of vision. In other words, you are operating with one eye closed....with fucking chopsticks. There's no depth of field. With the robot, there's 2 cameras, one for each eye, and you control the arms with your fingers like you normally operate. My attending loves it but she says when shit hits the fan you need to be ready to open them up. That's the risk with remotely doing the surgeries, but usually there should be an attending near by to jump in.",

For example, a gyn i was working with was staring at this spot in the pelvis debating whether or not its the ureter or the uterine artery. You arent supposed to cut the ureter during hysterectomies. \n\nSometimes its other things beyond control. One of the biggest reasons for getting surgery is having a previous surgery. When you start touching things on the inside, scar tissue forms called adhesions. Everytime itll happen and by the end of the case, you can see them start. These can cut off circulation to bowels or constrict them so you get obstruction. They are also a huge pain in the ass to clean. One case i was in for a gallbladder. Ezpz supposed to be 30 minutes once incisions for laproscopes were made. He was riddled with adhesions and the attending and resident had to open him up. They were not in a good mood that day. Turned out to be 4.5 hours total. ",

You place your thumb and index fingers through loops which allow you to manipulate instruments, and you have foot pedals which allow for additional functions (clamping, stapling, etc.).  Robotic assisted surgery is really no different from standard laparoscopic surgery, which has been around for decades, except that it allows for finer control.  It can translate your shaky 2 cm movement into a smooth 2 mm movement within the patient.  You still have a full staff of OR nurses, techs, anesthetists, etc. immediately next to the patient; the only difference is the surgeon sits in the corner at the control station.",

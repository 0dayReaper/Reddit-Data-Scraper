As you can see, them being trees allows you to sort of do a round of slashing where you set the buckets, then a second round where you get the buckets.\n\nIn Congo, the plant they got rubber from was a [vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landolphia_owariensis). You cannot really do this technique to a vine, so what was done instead is that a piece of the vine would be cut, and then sliced vertically. You would then take the milky sap from the vertical slash and lather it on your body, where it would quickly dry and become a thin layer of latex.\n\nThis obviously has some major drawbacks, it prevents you from sweating properly as your body is covered in plastic in every pore. It hurts when you rip the latex off as it is basically like waxing. \n\nIt leads to little % of the latex is harvested for each vine cut, while killing the vine. This makes a specific geographic area quickly become scarce in harvestable vines, until new ones grow and mature, something which the rubber quota did not adjust for. So same people would be sent in the same area, and day by day their task would become more and more impossible.\n\nBut this is what the Belgians forced the Congolese to do in Leopold's Congo, among other things. If you did not meet your rubber quota for the day, your family would be mutilated in order to punish you while allowing you to be able bodied for another day in hell. Please note, they would also kill, hand chop, brandish, starve the workers, it's just that this was not the specific standard punishment for not meeting the daily rubber quota.\n\nLeopold really is in the hall of fame for being one of the biggest pieces of shit in history.",

IIRC the US trail of tears and resettlement of indigenous people was one of many inspirations for the Nazi concentration camps. And I mean many. By the time the Nazis were doing their thing with concentration camps there were a bunch of other historical examples they pointed to when a nation thought they had the moral high ground on them. A bunch of Western nations (nations all over, really) had used some form of concentration camps, all of them to varying degrees of awful. The US implemented concentration camps for Japanese Americans and immigrants *during the war* and then later made an intentional switch from concentration camp to internment camp to try to distance what they did from what the Nazis did.\n\nHitler was a giant, genocidal turd. But one of many in the toilet bowl we call history.",

The point of those was to gather people in one controlled area, the British used it to try and separate out the civilians from insurgents. Lots of people starved as a concequence, including lots of soldiers, who appeared to still feed the prisoners while they themselves were starving. I don't know enough about the US ones to comment. \n\nAgain, both awful, nobody would have starved if they never did it. But to look at Nazi death camps and say that 'the Americans did it too!' is a misrepresentation IMO. They have the same name, but what the Nazis did was on another level of scale, malicious intent and sheer brutality.",

Artisanal mining operations, vital to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of families, are essentially unsafe, ragged holes in the ground, with manual labor, children present, and miners so poor they dig without ladders or tools, some literally by hand. Industrial mines are sophisticated operations similar to strip mining for coal in the United States, with much mechanization and automation, but similarly widespread",

It involves collecting maximum amount of latex by tapping frequently, making double cuts, using yield simulants, etc.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_tapping\n\n&gt; [...] rising demand for rubber worldwide in the late nineteenth century, debt-slave \"hunters\" began tapping more intensively, using ladders to extract as much latex as possible from all areas of the tree, killing the tree as a result. This \"slaughter tapping\" resulted in the destruction of all latex-bearing trees across large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Eventually, the establishment of rubber plantations in the Far East made \"hunting\" of naturally occurring rubber trees unprofitable, and the practice largely ceased in the early twentieth century.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughter_tapping",

While it may be tempting to draw similarities between the green plants and the animal kingdom, there are plenty of reasons to warrant hesitation at doing so. For one, most plants have embryonic development at all stages of life, unlike animals which have a short early period of embryonic development that then halts. There are many species (in particular those with deciduous growth habits) that shed off large portions of themselves at regular intervals. If one finds grief from this sort of process happening to a plant, it would be no great leap to carry the sentiment over to mourning the natural apoptosis that happens in animal embryonic development.",

A longer cut means you\u2019re creating a larger opening in the vein. It appears that there have been some chemicals tested that help the latex to flow more freely, justifying a shorter cut. \n\nI could be totally wrong, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m gathering from context clues in reading about the process.",

There was a very helpful comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/zyilc6/how_rubber_trees_are_tapped_to_collect_latex/j26ykfm?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3). \n\nI think what might better help understand whats going on here: picture the phloem as being tubes filled with water going straight up and down. Cutting sideways lets you hit multiple tubes, and if you cut a ring around the tree you hit all of them. But picture what would happen if you cut a perfect ring. Each tube would drain out but it doesnt have a preference for where it flows. Just down. So there is no good area to collect the sap as it all just runs down the bark. Cutting it the way they do (in a spiral) gives it a preferred place to run down so it can be collected in a single spot.\n\nCutting it in a ring has another nasty side effect. That is effectively girdling the tree. By cutting a ring, you seperate the roots from the leaves. And it kills the tree. Keep in mind, the wood of a tree is actually dead. Only the outermost layers of the tree and its bark are alive. They carry sugars down from the leaves, and that liquid is what they are collecting. Collect it all and you starve the roots to death. \n\nI am curious about why they did that one long cut down however. That didnt seem to aide in collection. Maybe its just a guide for later",

            "comment": "~LATEX FOAM HISTORY~\n\nLatex foam for bedding use was invented in the 1920\u2019s. The Dunlop company (yes, the tire company) figured out how to transform liquid rubber tree sap into supple foam. It quickly became a significant component for the mattress industry and initially all latex foam for bedding was produced from 100% natural latex. But, during WW2, raw latex like many other commodities was diverted for the wartime effort to make tires and other items. Scientists scrambled to find an alternative. Synthetic latex, using petroleum compounds, was then invented as an attempt to reproduce the molecular structure of natural latex, it was an early version of plastic.\n\nThe continued evolution of plastics transformed how foam was made and in turn transformed the mattress industry. While latex for the bedding industry has always been available, it fell out of favor for \u201cnew-tech\u201d and low-cost foams often used today. As consumers have become increasingly more conscious and educated about the products they consume and surround themselves with, latex is surging back, largely due to its natural &amp; health benefits along with its unique ability to simultaneously provide pressure relief and postural support.\n\nThere are four latexes:\n1)Organic,\n2) Natural,\n3) Blended,\n4) Synthetic",

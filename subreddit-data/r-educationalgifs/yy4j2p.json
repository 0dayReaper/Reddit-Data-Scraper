            "comment": "Also, to get really nerdy, notice that the ship has three propellers: one on each side and one in the center. But if you look closely in the clip, the reciprocating steam engines aren't connected to the central propeller. The central propeller was actually spun using a steam turbine; basically a smaller propeller in a sealed chamber that is being spun by steam. Interestingly this turbine was only able to be spun in one direction, which meant the central propeller could only propel the ship forwards. In reverse, they would just stop the central propeller while the outer propellers did the work.",

Personally, I don't use 'nerdy' as a bad word - it's describing a fact, or the like, that is on a deeper intellectual level. \n  \nThere are two meanings of the word 'nerd' on Merriam-Webster  \n1. a person devoted to intellectual, academic, or technical pursuits or interests  \n2. an unstylish or socially awkward person.\n  \nI, personally, use 'nerd' as meaning number 1. For number two, I use 'dork'. This is, to some extent, confirmed further down on Merriam-Webster:\n  \n&gt; The usage of nerd is now often used in a neutral fashion to denote enthusiasm or expertise (theater nerd) or proudly as a self-identifying trait (word nerd). Geek became synonymous with nerd in the 1950s and has similarly seen increasing use with positive connotations, showing membership in a specialized group (film geek, beer geek) rather than social awkwardness.",

More importantly, survivors from the crew who were in the boiler rooms at the time of the iceberg strike, like Fred Barrett, insisted that the order received from the bridge was full stop, not full astern.",

But secondly, you would never do that anyway, as you would never stop in time, it would be the second SLOWEST way to stop the ship, and worst of all, it would mean losing all control from the rudder, which is always your best bet for avoiding a collision. In fact the correct thing to do would be ahead full and hard to port, but frankly, an even better bet would have just been to steer straight into the thing and let the ship's crumple zones take care of it without the risk of compromising the integrity of multiple compartments. She'd have been real banged up and pretty much the entire bow would have had to have been replaced but she would have made it back to port.",

The steam engines can be reversed simply by shifting the same valves that control the speed. A steam turbine, on the other hand, can only spin in one direction. The center prop would require a costly geared transmission to provide reverse thrust at the propeller. Further, the turbine might have been run using only high pressure steam which would have been available when operating at near-full power, but less so at lower power/lower speed, when lower steam pressure could be utilized by the two main engines.",

In reality with most modern turbos who have the highest powered engines, you need 1, maybe 2 for space reasons if you don't want to do the piping. F1 cars at 1000hp have 1 exhaust and even whent at wasn't mandatory they only had 2. But your souped up car needs 2 or 4? Same thing here, having a 4th exhaust makes people think of it as faster and in lune with competitors, even if historically less exhausts come from an increase in efficiency which would be a major performance upgrade.",

I guess the other side of it is that they were in use for so long that steam engines in the 20th century were very advanced and efficient, they had had literally hundreds of years to develop them",

Just as mass can be thought as resistance to changes in, essentially, linear motion, rotational inertia is resistance to changes in rotation. Additionally, torque and force are analogous to each other just rotational inertia and mass are. \n\nSo, just spinning a massive driveshaft requires enough torque to overcome the rotational inertia, much more than a smaller driveshaft. That torque is then being \"lost\" because you will need additional torque to actually spin against the resistance provided by the water.",

The thing here is the boiler does this under high pressure. The high pressure steam is pushed in a closed loop system (similar to a car coolant system) to the engines. The highest pressure steam would flow through a pair of high pressure cylinders driving them back and forth, then flow to the lower pressure cylinders doing the same thing. As the video shows, they're on a crankshaft which when timed right, would spin and create motion. Not shown in the video is the same high pressure steam would also turn a turbine engine for the center propeller as well as the electric dynamos for ship power. Once the steam was run through all those systems, it would go to condensers and be cooled back into water for a return to the boilers to start the process all over again.\n\nSteam locomotives work similarly, except instead of driving propellers, obviously, they drive wheels, though water is not reused in most cases. A nuclear plant is a steam system as well. The nuclear reactor creates heat which boils water which is used to drive massive electrical turbines to create power. Just a steam engine with extra steps, really. (yes, gross simplification, I know...)",

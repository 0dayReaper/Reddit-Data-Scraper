But since the inside wheel has less distance to cover because it's on the inside of the curve, it rides where the wheel diameter is smaller, and vice versa on the outside.\n\nThere's another, more flat flange on the inside of the wheel that helps prevent derailments. It comes into play when a train hits a curve at too much speed. Of course, there's only so much it can do, but that's the case with basically every engineered thing. It's safe enough.",

During a turn, the inside wheel is spinning too fast and the outside wheel too slow if the axle is at its \"straight\" position. When the wheels are not spinning at the same rate that the track is moving underneath them, that manifests as slipping. When the wheels slip, by definition, the static friction is overcome and you're in the realm of dynamic friction, which is lower. That is, the wheels skid like they're on ice. Then centrifugal force (or, rather, the inertia of the train) pushes the train to the outside until both wheels are in the position where they can maintain rolling without slipping. Then the static friction takes over again and the train follows the track.",

When it needs to turn, the wheel on the outside of the turn needs to turn faster and the wheel on the inside needs to turn slower. That's just physics, the inside of the turn has less distance to cover. Instead of turning the wheels, it just makes one wheel go to the smaller part of the wheel and the other wheel goes to the larger part so that they're still technically spinning the same speed but since the inner wheel is now smaller it turns \"faster\".",

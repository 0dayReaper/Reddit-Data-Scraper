We wouldn\u2019t make much (percentage wise) on tires but valve stems? Whoo wee. Plain valve stems cost US about 13 cents each. We sold them for 2.99. We sold one with a chrome sleeve that cost us 17 cents. We sold it for 3.99. We made $15 in profit just on valve stems for every set of four tires. I did some poking and we made several million dollars a year, just on valve stems.",

It's shockingly evil. \n\nPoliticians have long known that an uneducated populace is easier to manipulate, but an educated populace is more productive (in 20 words or less). \n\nIE a country with the best education systems in the world will probably be one of the most wealthy, but also one where the people are least tolerant of being taken advantage of. For decades, that applied to America - the people were wealthy, educated, science-minded, and politically active. (I'm ignoring race relations here for a number of reasons). \n\nAt some point, the world changed, and parts of America became far more poor than they were. These people became easy to manipulate with fear mongering (dey took ur jerbs!\"), leading to a party that benefits from people who are easy to manipulate while coasting on America's past efforts. \n\nThat party is now staying in power solely by actively continuing the cycle of poverty for millions, removing social nets and ensuring that they have no time to focus on getting educated or improving their lot. \n\nDrug dependence, anti-science, basically forcing women to have children and countless other atrocities are tolerated, or even enforced, among these people while spreading propaganda that it's all the fault of brown people.\n\nSo, they're deprived of healthcare, causing untold misery, as part of a strategy of staying in power for the sake of being in power. That's all that matters to them.",

If you open them facing toward you, it's likely that the pressure that's built up will cause a bit of yogurt to spray all over you.  If you open a yogurt and it doesn't pop a little, you become suspicious that it was already opened and might not be good any more.  Folks from lower elevations find this fascinating.",

The absolute pressure inside the bag, psia, is the same as atmospheric pressure.\n\nAs you increase in altitude, the atmospheric pressure goes down.  The air inside the bag will expand to match the outside pressure.  Absolute pressures are the same inside and outside, so still zero gauge pressure.\n\nAt some altitude, the gas inside the bag cannot expand anymore, because the bag hits max volume.  The absolute pressure inside the bag will always stay fixed from this point on (neglecting the stretchiness of the bag material and assuming no temperature changes), since the mass is fixed, the volume is fixed and the temperature is fixed.  That means pressure is fixed.\n\nAs you increase in altitude further, you start developing an absolute pressure difference between the fixed inside the bag pressure, and the dropping outside the bag pressure. \n\nThis means gauge pressure inside the bag, psig = inside psia - outside psia, goes UP as altitude increases.\n\nThe gif actually is wrong though.  Psig in the bag is zero until it expands to max volume.  So it should be zero until some altitude, THEN the pressure bar should start increasing.",

For those curious, the pressure at 3600m is only 65 percent of the pressure at sea level. \n\nHence, the pressure was around 0.65 bar, or alternatively, the lays pack was pressurized relative to the outside at about 5psi",

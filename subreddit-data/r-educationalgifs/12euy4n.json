You just insert it on one of the cable before making the connection and slide it when you're done.\n\n\nAs an electrician by formation only, I will say that those are not solid enough. The way I learn to make connections is easier and generally just as solid, but we also add a plastic cap that will strengthen the connection and make a proper protection for the other wires and their current: putting tape on those is not enough and not up to code.\n\n\n\nHowever, I know that in electronic, the regulation are often more permissive, and smaller wire also make a difference. I have no idea how that T connection will be secured properly though.",

There was a time before microprocessors that computers were wires routed around each other in ways that created gates and storage.  They hired seamstresses because the had the dexterity to essentially \u201csew\u201d the computer circuits.

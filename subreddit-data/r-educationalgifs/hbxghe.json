I remember being really worried about it though. \n \nAnd the idea of wondering my sexuality lingered most of my young adult life until I saw a couple of close girlfriends in grad school intimately off and on, and I did ultimately see \"bi\" as part of my identity after casually dating in my mid 20s, but I swear, it was liking the smell of gasoline and unlimited internet access that started this weird journey of defining who I was, kids are really weird. I'm gonna talk a lot to my future kids about internet stuff. And sex and sexuality. How do parents ecen manage internet usage for kids now a days? I got into so much stuff as a 90s kid/2000s kid on freaking dial up, pixelated clips a few mins long and now you can watch 75 mins zoomed in high res with a few seconds of loading.\n\n\nEdit: https://youtu.be/-aNgGNZW1Os",

Not that like I was an overly sexual child. Not lesbianism, just that I learned from the internet things that made an impression at around the time normal development of sexuality starts to come around. And that I don't know how parents monitor internet these days. And it was a weird connection btwn smell of gasoline, I'll give you that. I shouldnt reddit too early in the morning. Maybe journal instead hahah\n\nEdit (b/c I'm feeling awkward still): I think it was similar to the AIDS epidemic when it broke through in the news in the nineties. I was like oh wow, im little kid and I don't know what this means so I'm gonna get really nervous about it.  I like the smell of gas, the internet says then im gay, this is what gay is (insert more internet) I guess I'm gay. It wasn't really sexual, just like okay that's who i am now bc internet and 9 y.o brain.",

The settlers followed game trails through woods and past difficult terrain. \n\nWhen the roads were first being built and paved they delineated from the original paths only mildly, in most cases, for easier construction. \n\nMany of the other roads are named after the ranchers that lived there or how the road was used. Ie: \"Old San Antonio Road\" was/is the path from East Texas down through San Antonio which was necessary to get to Mexico. Or \"Jones Maltsberger\" which used to travel from the Jone's farm to the Maltsberger's.",

Once a year the Bronx River parkway becomes a river, not because the river floods, but because the parkway is built where the river used to be. Canal street in Chinatown used to be a canal, most of lower Manhattan was swampland they filled with trash so the could build on top of it.

Doesn't make it right, especially by today's standards. The only interesting aspect for me is how it might have helped people break the cycle of abuse in their house, by learning from a televised example how to vent feelings without resorting to violence.",

It can also house equipment to measure the level of petroleum in the tanks, and equipment which watches for potential leaks in the tanks or lines.  Usually there are smaller dumps that house the tank gauge, the fill port (for the delivery truck to add petroleum to the tanks), and vents to balance the pressure of evaporating gasoline by allowing the vapor to move into the truck during delivery.",

A pipe is inserted in the water. A motor above the fluid level removes enough air from the pipe to decrease the air pressure above the gasoline. The motor continues to remove air until the air pressure above the gasoline is lower than the air pressure pushing down on the gas outside the pipe. The weight of the surrounding air forces the gas inside the pipe upward even as gravity tries to pull it back down. When the air pressure inside the pipe is low enough, the gas simply climbs up into the above ground dispenser.\n\na check valve hold the gas in the main-line so it doesn't just fall back into the tank when nobody is pumping gas.\n\nas for why the line seems to run away from the pumps before going back to them.. I think for this example it's simply to make it easier to view, as when I searched online the main pipes normally go pretty much straight to the spot you get the gas from.\n\nalso, the thing you are dispensing gas from, itself is NOT a pump. it's only a flow meter. which is why they make a little ticking noise sometimes, the main pumps are doing most of the work, the thing you pick your fuel from is just measuring how much you're dispensing.\n\nand lastly as an interesting note, If your fuel station offers 3 grades of fuel, they likely only have two actual tanks, the mid-grade fuel option is blended my mixing the high grade fuel with the low grade fuel to create the middle number!",

If the local refinery is a Shell, then the trucks for a the local stations are filling up at the Shell refinery.  That's right, you're filling up at the Exxon station but it's Shell gasoline coming out the hose.",

In my experience we were never low enough to need a whole truck load of gas considering the tanks have safety limits that don't allow you to fill them all the way. If you tried alarms would sound as the in tank sensors detected gas over the max fill line which was somewhere like 75 or 80%full",

There needs to be an air pocket for gases to go in the tank (many tanks use suction pumps as well which need air space)\nand on the flip side you do not want them TOO empty or there's a risk of too much fumes accumulating in the tank, as well as issues pumping gas. Much like you don't want to run on empty too much!\n\nso tankers mostly just \"top off\" gas station tanks to their fill levels. and can stop at multiple locations before it needs to refill it's own tank.\n\nAlso they normally (at least with holiday gas stations) carry multiple grades of fuel, the high octane and low octane being the most common. the mid grade fuel is actually blended at the dispenser of these two fuels to create the mid grade fuel.",

If the stuff has been in the earth for 30+ years and chemical decomposition has started, it tends to smell a certain way. If you find old gas/oil tanks underground and strip dem down, you need to wear a mask or you hit the floor pretty fast.\n\nFascinating stuff I really love doing but man, people did not give a shit about gas/diesel spills until the 90s/2000s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDit.

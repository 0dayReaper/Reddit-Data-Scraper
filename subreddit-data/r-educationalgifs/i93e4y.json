It is critical to find a place that looks like rainwater would collect, because this sand will be easier to dig through.\n\nAt the center of the hole you just dug, make another small indentation about the size of your water container. Place the container inside the hole.\n\nCover the 4 x 3 foot hole with your plastic sheet. Make sure there is a little give. Anchor the edges with dirt or rocks. Make sure there is no spaces left open where moisture can escape.\n\nTake your small rock in the center of sheet (this is why you needed give). Weighing down the center means any gathered condensation will pull to that point. Gravity will cause it to drip. This is also useful during windy days and keeps the sheet from flapping.\n\nWithin a few hours, the air inside the still will become saturated.",

I'd been taught by mountain guides that it was a full ten minutes (20 years ago). This may be because at higher altitudes water boils more easily (ie it boils at lower temperatures) because there is less atmospheric weight/pressure on it.",

                            "comment": "I don't have any sources rn but I just completed clinical microbiology in the spring. It comes from a difference between the terms: disinfection, sanitization, and sterilization.\n\nWhen something is disinfected, the microbes (even living ones) can still be present, just not at levels that can make you sick (for the time being). This is the \"our hand sanitizer kills 99.9% of germs\" thing. This is the level of microbial control you need for most household situations (bathroom, kitchen, etc). Boiling for one minute will get you here.\n\nSterilization, on the other hand, is complete destruction of all microbes present including endospores and weirdos like hyperthermophiles. True sterilization is exceedingly difficult to recreate because things like hyperthermophiles actually *like* boiling water. IIRC it's not actually possible to achieve true sterilization with boiling water, you'll need something like an autoclave (combines steam and very high pressure) to do the job.\n\nFinally, sanitization is a median between those, it's disinfection up to a certain standard. Most disinfectants kill at a logarithmic rate, roughly 90% per minute. That hand sanitizer from before works over 3 minutes, so that's where 99.9% comes from. This means, after 10 minutes of exposure to bleach, 10^-9? microbes remain. For most clinical settings, this is the point you want to get to protect people who may be immunodeficient (hint: almost everyone who is showing up).\n\nFinally, each sanitization standard is different. This is because all methods of microbial control aren't made equal, and your goals may be different. Again, I don't have any sources, but the standard we were taught for boiling whatever could tolerate that sort of sanitization process (read: mostly metal) for 10 minutes. This is the only thing I could think op would be referring to. So not exactly related to making water potable. The problem is, even that isn't really considered effective anymore. Endospores can survive boiling for insane periods (way beyond 12 hours), and become pathogenic in very short order. Again, not useful in a household setting unless you get something like c.diff.",

Many of these will have survived, and will end up germinating into active cells again.\n\nIf you really want to kill all of the microbes you'd use an autoclave, which is a machine that heats the sample above boiling temperature and also applies a lot of pressure.  The combination of the two is much more effective at killing spores.  The Gif doesn't say how long the agar plate with boiled spores was kept for or what it was even made of, but I'd be surprised if nothing was alive in there.  \n\nBesides, you can't tell if a microbial cell is dead just by looking at it, so there's no guarantee that everything under the microscope was dead.  Most of them probably were, but microbes are pretty good at surviving stresses, especially when they make spores or biofilms.  There are some microbes which actually grow best at high (even boiling) temperatures, and although they're unlikely to have been in there, there are some microbes which are surprisingly tolerant of higher temperatures to the point that I'd be surprised if nothing at all was alive in there.  There's also the fact that most microbes in the world won't grow on an agar plate, so just because the plate was clear doesn't mean that nothing survived.",

I could never understand how it got through the bearing holding the bobbin. I think I now understand that the bobbin is just it\u2019s own little spool that sits freely inside the hook thing. A better 3D view would be nice.\n\nThank to everyone! After many, many years ( include a couple of summers cleaning sewing machines with rags and toothbrushes) I finally understand. The hook can actually be on a bearing, and the thread never has to pass over it, it just says in the hook area. That and the free-floating bobbin!\n\nNow I need to work on how to fold a fitted sheet.",

I can imagine that it slips behind the bobbin, but somehow in front of the hook. Even this better diagram doesn\u2019t clarify that. But after many, many years of wondering, I think I\u2019m getting there.\n\nMr Singer was a clever guy.",

There is a gap on either side of the shuttle for the thread to pass through.\n\nI found another video that I think does a better job showing it. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rUSecXVt-jU\n\nHere is a video showing how the shuttle hook and bobbin go into the machine. You can see they sort of free float. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4rQH4AcpYFw\n\nSkip to about 1:25 in the second video.",

As the hook rotates it pulls the top thread around but guides it towards the bobbin case, not under itself. When it\u2019s about 2/3 around the pull up arm on the top of the machine pulls the thread under the bobbin case making the top thread loop around the bobbin thread making what is loosely a knot. In some cases the hook reverses to start over and in others it makes an entire revolution without thread to reset. \n\nHere\u2019s another look:  https://youtu.be/rUSecXVt-jU",

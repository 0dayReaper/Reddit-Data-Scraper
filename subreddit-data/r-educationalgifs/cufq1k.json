For some people, teaching comes naturally, for others, it doesn't. It also doesn't help when the professor gauges the success of his/her teaching methods from the vocal minority of the top students in class. The students who are truly having a hard time in class tend not to speak up. I've had a professor that understood that and made it a point to engage the C crowd (aka bulk of the bell curve). Anyone below a certain threshold in the class, he would require them to go to special group sessions where he would cover (again) some of the more difficult concepts from the main lecture. He would randomly select people in the class to answer questions to make sure everyone was understanding. That's of course atypical and I wouldn't expect many professors to spend that much extra time and energy doing what he did. It just shows you that teaching-ability is a spectrum (often only loosely related to competency in the topic), and there are extremes on both ends.",

With degrees it's (number of degrees)/360\\*(circumference of circle)\n\nThe latter was much more useful when people needed to do the calculation by hand and needed to actually *make* protractors. But there is nothing theoretically significant about a degree\n\n* derivatives of trigonometric functions are simpler and cyclical (using degrees includes a constant factor after every derivative)\n\nThis one sort of snowballs and seals the deal. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x). If x is degrees instead then it's (180/pi)cos(x). That also makes a huge mess when doing complex analysis due to the relationship between e and trig functions.",

If you traced two inches for the first, or 20 miles for the second, circle and did the same the angle would be two radians.\n\nHow far is it around the entire circle? The circumference is two times pi times the radius. So if you traced out that angle it would be 2pi radians. Half of the circle, pi radians.\n\nWe used a circle to help define a radian, but the only part that matters is the angle. Anytime you have an angle you can use radians.",

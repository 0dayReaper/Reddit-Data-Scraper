So as the drop gets smaller, it's even less happy about being in a drop instead of with the rest of the water because the ratio of surface area to volume is higher with a smaller drop. You can see this with how the water drop ends up sitting on the surface for shorter and shorter periods of time as it gets smaller. So forming an even smaller drop is probably not the case.",

What happens is it gradually bounces up and down until it is absorbed.\n\nUnderneath the droplet is a very thin layer of air, which allows it to sit temporarily above the surface. The air layer takes a bit of time to be pushed aside by the droplets weight. As the air moves from under the droplet, the surface of water pinches at water for a split second absorbing it. However it happens so fast that the connection is cut off between them and so a smaller droplet which hasn\u2019t been absorbed bounces up.\n\nAs contact is made, waves are generated at the point of contact which surround the droplet, and go up the sides. This produces a force which allows the water droplet to leap up into the air. As it leaps up into the air, air fills the space underneath and the droplet once again sits on the thin layer of air. This process repeats until the mass of the droplet is so small it can just be absorbed by the water.\n\nhttps://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/12162224250",

Two pieces of dust kind of close together are not destined to collide. Stars form in nebulae because of a lot of space dust in a reasonably concentrated area (simplified). \n\nThese droplets are moving fast enough to overcome gravity. They are held together by other things.",

The speed of signals moving through neurons is slower than the speed of copper wire. But on the microscopic scale, everything is so much faster, the molecules that make up air are moving hundreds of miles per second. Even insects process more information per second than us because of their tiny brains. From the perspective of an atom, humans are laggy machines made out of trillions of tiny cogs trying to move each other. A second is forever compared to planck time.",

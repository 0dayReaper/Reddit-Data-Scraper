Probably the coolest thing about a Lunar Eclipse.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Because it's all of the world's sunrises and sunsets shining into the Moon at once.\n\nTo clarify, the red hue is due to an effect called Rayleigh scattering. This same effevt is why the sky is blue. When light from the sun enters the atmosphere, blue wavelengths are scattered about the upper atmosphere, whereas red and orange wavelengths pass through relatively unobstructed. This is why the sky is blue. During sunsets and sunrises, the sun is at a lower angle compared to the Earth, and so has more atmosphere to work through and so more wavelengths are filtered out just red remains. [And then it flashes green. No, I'm not kidding.](https://youtu.be/vXOYbzQ4jDA) Also, the light in this video is even redder than you would see during a sunset because it has twice the amount of atmosphere to work through, as you are invariably at the centre of wherever you stand on the planet, so to get to the moon, it has to work its way through the other side of the atmosphere.",

I wasn't sure if the size of the Earth's shadow compared to the moon at these distances would be small enough to show a pronounced curve or if it's some other artifact of the shape of the moon or the camera exposures used to get those shots?",

Almost like a ring of red light is hitting the moon. Since the light is being diffused through the atmosphere, even if it weren't colored, the middle of the shadow would be darkest.\n\nThe curve you see at the beginning is the Earth's Umbra. The Moon is in the Penumbra the entire time: https://moon.nasa.gov/news/168/an-almost-total-lunar-eclipse/",

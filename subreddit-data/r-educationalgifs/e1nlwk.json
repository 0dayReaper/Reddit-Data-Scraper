Because this bacteria is moving (with its own chemotaxis mechanism) it is using more energy and thus makes more metabolic byproducts. The neutrophil \u201cknows\u201d where to go because it is responding to a gradient created by the bacteria. You can even see the neutrophil sensing the other bacteria but it goes for the one moving because the gradient is stronger. That\u2019s my understanding at least. If there are any immunologists here they might be able to explain it better.",

He and the other bacteria that was spared, whose name is Moaki, grew up together in a small fishing village on a remote island. \n\nFrom a young age they trained in martial arts together day in and day out at the only dojo on the entire island.  Yamoko was an outgoing, cheerful boy, and *always* bested Moaki, the weaker and shyer of the two. \n\nTheir rivalry - a lopsided one, for Yamoko would forever consider them friends, rather than rivals - lasted well into their young adulthood.  \n\nEventually, the nearby feudal lord declared war on a much larger organism, and went to all the local villages to recruit young men for the effort.  Yamoko boldly volunteered, and Moaki, refusing to be bested by his rival, volunteered as well. \n\nYamoko quickly distinguished himself in the ranks, leading groups of men deep into enemy territory, past neutrophils and macrophages and even going toe-to-toe with *two Killer T cells simultaneously*. \n\nSo one day, early in the morning, Moaki, overcome with jealousy, spiked Yamoko's morning tea with Dreamy Willow, an herb that helped old men get to sleep.  Not a lot, not to kill him.  Moaki merely wanted to slow Yamoko down so that he could get a chance to step out of Yamoko's shadow. \n\nOf course, that was the day they ran into Badragga, the deadliest neutrophil in the four body cavities.  Badragga systematically slaughtered Yamoko's entire unit, until only Yamoko and Moaki were left. \n\nWhat you see in this clip is Badragga briefly moving to attack Moaki, until Yamoko throws several kunai at him to again draw his attention.

Like other commenters have said, off target effects or non-specificity  (think replacing areas of similar sequences to the one you\u2019re actually trying to replace) is one the biggest drawbacks. The guide rna matches a specific code that you\u2019re trying to replace, but if that code is only like x nucleotides long there\u2019s probably quite a few other regions with something close enough to what the guide codes for, hence, the cas9/grna complex will produce more mistakes by misidentification. That\u2019s my base level understanding",

They've got two concepts of the \"atman\" (sort of like a soul) and the \"brahman\" (sort of the ultimate truth underlying all reality).

Basically, they came together and condemned some views that were heretic and explained what the majority believed was true. \n\nAs an example, Origenism wasn\u2019t condemned which was not the belief of the majority and the church; Monophysitism was condemned and Jesus Christ declared God and Man - doesn\u2019t mean that the church didn\u2019t belief this aspect before that. They just didn\u2019t have the need to formulate it that exact. \nIf you read the acts of the councils, their declarations then you will see that all the explanations were done as to oppose what they believed was a heresy. If the church didn\u2019t believe Jesus was God and then some freaking dudes stand up and start claiming that he is then this would be condemned by the council as the majority was deciding. Here, in contrary they said he is God and created the formula of how he is God and what they believed already before the council took place.",

                                                            "comment": "Similarly to taking care of your \"cells\" collectively (your body.. via eating habits, exercise habits, medicine, skin care, etc) one should take care of the society and the earth it lives on, collectively. You don't focus on one cell when you eat, exercise, etc. It's the collective. \n\nThe thing is that cities (and bigger, countries) are another example of a macroscopic organism that requires other macroscopic organisms. Just like human bodies. According to systems theory, cities might be alive too. They subsist off of money, which is carried by human beings into and out of it once a day. Rush hour traffic. A city has a heart beat of 2 per day, in and out. It reproduces in the form of suburbs. They even carry different personalities. Just like oxygen and blood and sex and psychology work in our body, but on a bigger scale.\n\nSo we should perhaps approach society as a collective thing, rather than focusing specifically on individual occurrences. Many lines of thought agree there, across the entire political spectrum. \n\nAnother thing to consider, if you and I are the same kind of \"cell\" (at this scale I think \"electron\" would be better)  then it helps my empathy to understand we're both capable of terrible and wondrous things. You are no more or less a human, a cell, than me or Bill Gates or Charles Manson or Donald Trump. We're all just skin cells, capable of being cancerous. I find that simply being *aware* and willing to question, \"am I being that cancerous cell today\" makes me a better person overall. And the thing about sapience is, we are the only things that have it. Human beings. No matter how prolific life is, *intelligent* life by mass is **crazy** rare in this universe. That alone makes that whole \"existential crisis\" for me a thing to ignore. We are fucking special, even the dumbest most heinous people on earth. \n\nBut one would better look at our entire human existence on earth in the millions of years as a single atom within a single cell of the pineal gland, maybe. That's the kind of scale of the universe. \n\nSo... so what? I have to live here, now. So do you. So how do we do so together? We're gonna disagree. We all do. But what's better for the collective? We've been working that out as a species for thousands and thousands of years. I don't think any single one of those humans can definitively say \"this is, this isn't\" about *everything*. So what's the solution? \n\nI'm my opinion, a truly \"good\" person is just someone who asks themselves, \"is what I'm doing right?\" on occasion, and really honestly questions it, and if they're unsure, they honestly seek guidance. Bad people never do, they *assume* they're good and just go on acting on their impulses. You cannot *accidentally* be a good person. It must be a conscious effort. \n\nSo what's the takeaway? Morally speaking, we should accept we are all flawed from the get go, we're capable of being that cancer. Interestingly, that lines right up with some Christian theology in original sin. Once we understand that capability, once we've made a subconscious truth into conscious thought, then we can truly apply our weight to fixing our bettering it.\n\nYou might ask, \"if that's a moral structure, why isn't this saying what *is* right and what isn't?\". I feel that humans in even diseased societies have an innate sense of right and wrong. Psychology itself basically operates on that notion, it sets a baseline we call normal and deviant, I'll and unstable behavior falls outside of that. Same with the *biology* of the brain and every other organ. We take \"the mean\" to be \"normal, functioning\". And we're mostly right in those conclusions I think. \n\nSo just like a white blood cell doesn't understand what its doing when it acts nominally, neither really do we need to in order to know \"right\" and \"wrong\". We just need to nominally function. The divisions in our politics and ideology come from our individual interpretations of \"nominal\". I'm certainly not above judging people either, because like our bodies, we use some cells to restrict or \"fix\" others, and even sometimes kill others. There's a time and place for all of that, which is evident throughout pretty much all societies.\n\nBut I ramble. You asked for it.",

Once they bind to the little slots called \"receptor sites\" they activate the receptor and cause the cells to do different things. They are basically used for signaling. For example activation of receptor \"A\" causes the bacteria to move forward and activation of receptor \"B\" causes the bacteria to move backwards. White blood cells take advantage of the same cytokines used by bacteria so that if they detect receptor \"A\" cytokines they also move forward. Lets say receptor \"C\" is to rotate left. White blood cells copy this and also rotate left, and so on. They are mimicking the movements of bacteria not by sight, but more like taste.",

A very well known expression of this is in quorum sensing by types of bacteria.\n\nEssentially the bacteria can sense when the number of them in an area reaches a critical mass. When they do they then all start producing a polysaccharide matrix that binds them all together. This is a biofilm. It helps stop the permeating of toxins like antibiotics.\n\nChemical signaling is also how are cells signal damage to initiate other to come help heal. Chemical signaling starts the clotting process, the foreign body response. Immune cells even communicate and merge to form giant cells when trying to encapsulate debris in our bodies that is too big for one cell",

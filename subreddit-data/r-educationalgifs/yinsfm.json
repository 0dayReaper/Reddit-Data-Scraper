It's hard to see, but that broach (the long rod with the teeth is a broaching tool) is tapered so that each set of \"teeth\" that passes through the part has a slightly larger diameter. Each one of those \"teeth\" has a sharp cutting edge on the side that makes contact as it passes through the part taking a minimal amount of material.",

The work is drilled close to the size of the tip and, with the tip of the broach being round, is a guide for the tool.\n\nThe machine doing the work is a pull broaching machine that is on the other side of the work out of frame. Common broaching machines are push type.",

Wouldn't it be more effective if the whole apparatus were rotated so that the shaft moved vertically? Then the metal plates would be resting on a flat horizontal surface.",

The episode where Princess Clara's intellectually disabled sister comes to visit. The entire episode is \ud83d\udc80.",

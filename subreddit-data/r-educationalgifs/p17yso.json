Friend (#1) decided to try to measure the wort temp with an mercury oral thermometer. Couldn't stop him in time and he exploded it. Tried to hide everything before my parents got home.\n\nWe cooled the wort in a bathtub and said my friend (#2) needed to use it to measure stomata exposure in leaves for a high school science project (because we totally had a microscope to do that...). Next day I come home and the house reeked of beer. My mom made beer bread. Later that night my friend (#2) comes over and as we go downstairs my dad says \"boys, come here\". Luckily they were chill with it and let us bottle it since they weren't chill with our original plan of selling it to another high school friend. Ah, to be young and dumb.",

That air expands because that's what gases do when the get hot. Less dense gas rises, exiting the tube from the top. Because you have gas escaping out the top, and nature hates vacuums, it has to refill from the bottom. The elbow at the bottom ensures that the air is coming from outside the log and therefore not just exhaust from the fire itself.",

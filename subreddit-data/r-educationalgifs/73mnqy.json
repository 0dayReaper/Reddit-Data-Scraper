It's convienient since it'll be playable on nearly any system, but makes for some pretty large files. Things like ALAC and FLAC are still lossless, but still use compression to save a decent amount of space. \n\nThere's also more to music files than just the encoding type you see. For example, you could \"convert\" a 64kbps MP3 to a lossless type like WAV/FLAC but would just have garbage then (garbage in, garbage out). ",

Diminishing returns and you can barely spot the difference. However over time your brain acclimatizes to the subtleties and if you downgrade to 60fps it's VERY noticeable. 60 will feel quite choppy for a while.",

Like at 3440x1440 my GTX 1080 will only run The Witcher 3 around 50-70fps depending on where I am in the game and what mods I'm using. Would 144Hz be good for tearing even though I'm only running at this lower frame rate? My monitor has g-sync, which I wanted specifically for tearing, but the 144Hz Samsung microdot monitors had real good picture quality for sure. I just didn't know if the 144Hz would be better for tearing vs. 100 Hz with g-sync. ",

I was playing the Witcher 3 on my 1070 at 4k, and I was like, \"wow, I don't remember this being capable of running at 60fps.\"  Checked the settings and it was a proper 30fps lock.  I had the same experience with For Honor.  The vast majority of PC games have terrible frame pacing, though and it makes the frame rate look much worse than it is.\n\nFor the unititiated, frame pacing at its worst is when a game averages a certain framerate, but the moment-to-moment delivery of those frames are at a different rate.  For instance, if a game delivered one frame for .5 seconds, then gave you 29 new frames on every refresh of the monitor for the next .5 second, that would average to 30 fps.  But what you'd really be seeing is one frame at 2fps, and 29 frames at 60--which is going to look choppy as hell compared to 30 fps, with one frame delivered every 33ms.\n\n[Digital Foundry covers frame pacing a LOT](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-frame-rate-vs-frame-pacing).",

In a game, shutter speed doesn't exist (or in pretty much any computer program), so every frame is a still picture with absolutely no blur, taken at an instant. When these images are combined at a too low framerate, our brains can see the individual images..resulting in choppy footage.\n\nVideo is typically filmed at a shutter angle of 180\u00b0. In other words, the shutter speed is double of the framerate. 24 frames per second gives a shutter speed of 1/48th of a second. 60 fps would give 1/120th of a second.\n\nThis shutter speed causes blur, because 1/48th of a second is actually quite long, especially when an object is moving fast. Our brains can then not see th individual frames, and combines the blurriness. This allows our brains to smooth out the low framerates.",

It's most visible when something has to cross the screen quickly, like the background when the fellowship of the ring is hiking with a helicopter mounted camera circling them. Filmmakers will try to hide this by having the fast moving parts be out of focus so you don't notice a blurry thing staggering across the screen.\n\nSay what you will about the experimental 48fps theatrical viewing of The Hobbit movies, but when they did the encircling helicopter shots it was all so refreshingly smooth. When they did close up interiors it felt like a stage play or a sitcom because the brain was used to seeing 30fps as daytime drama and real life as significantly higher. Sometimes the 48fps looked like bad tv, sometimes like real life. It really should be more common for nature documentaries and sports. I don't think anyone would complain about those having high frame rates.\n\nAng Lee is working on some movie at 120fps. I wonder how that'll go.",

When the difference is an integer multiple (ie. 2x, 4x), it's extremely easy to convert upwards (show each frame from a 15 FPS video twice for 30) or downwards (show every other frame of a 30 FPS video for 15). Factors of two would work for this, but I guess it just wasn't chosen.\n\nAlso, 60 FPS is the standard for North America because the frequency for AC power is 60 Hz - for CRTs, this meant they would do 60 cycles a second, due to the frequency of supplied power. This is why older EU TVs used 50 FPS - the frequency for their power was 50 Hz.",

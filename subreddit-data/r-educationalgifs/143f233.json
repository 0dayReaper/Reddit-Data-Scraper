Every time you leave the ground, you will be at the voltage (more specifically, potential) of the ground you left, and then landing at the next spot will equalize you to the new potential. With most shoes, there's likely enough insulation that you won't feel the equalization, but it might be felt as a small shock. Which is to say: yes, there is a \"persistence of voltage\" but it's not a problem. A small amount of charge will rapidly flow into/out of you but that's fine.\n\nThe thing you want to avoid is setting two parts of your body to different potentials. Then you have two areas that are constantly trying to set your body to their potential, which means you get a steady current flowing through you. That's bad. On the plus side, you'll become a \"live\" demonstration of what happens when a human body becomes a part of the power grid, so that's kinda cool. So maybe do whatever it takes to be *absolutely certain* you're only touching the ground at one point.",

But usually it's a relatively slow change, so you don't notice.\n\nNot slow, just small. It happens in a few nanoseconds, but only involves a small amount of charge.\n\nA human body has about 100 pF capacitance and 10,000 ohms resistance, so the time constant for changing potential is about 1 microsecond (capacitance x resistance). If you touch a 1 kV line, you'll acquire 1 kV x 100 pF = 10^-7 Coulombs of charge. If that all happened in 1 microsecond it would be a current of 100 mA, but in practice it's even less since it takes many times the time constant to reach equilibrium.",

You can slowly shuffle out with both feet on the ground. \n\nThe danger lies if there is a difference in potential (voltage) between your two feet. When one foot is on the ground, there's no potential difference and so there is no current flowing. But if both feet are on the ground and if they're at different potentials (which they probably are), you'll get a high flow of current between your legs and fry off your genitals.",

To put in more concrete terms, imagine you are standing right in the middle of a circle which has a radius of 10 meters, imagine then that at the centre of the circle there is a 1000 voltage potential that reduces gradually as it gets further away from the centre, eventually becoming zero at the edge of the circle. \nSo if you are at the centre and hop 1 meter you will find your self standing in a zone that has 900 volts, take another and you will be at 800 V and so on till you get to 0. The problem here arises if you put your feet in two separate zones with different voltages, since the difference of voltage is what fundementally create electricity, you will experience current going from one leg to the other, and depending on the voltage, you could get totally fried. P. S. The values I threw in for the voltages (1000, 900 ecc) are completely random, they are just to give the idea \n\nSource: I studied this scenario in uni, even though they didn't suggest hopping on one leg, but rather \"slither\" (with your feet) your way out while always maintaining ground contact (again, with your feet) and doing small movements",

Chances are this could make it even worse if while hoping in one leg you lower the other enough that a spark can jump from the tip of your leg to the ground, considering the dielectric capacity of air is so high.\n\nIn other words.. This would work if you see the that the live wire contact with the ground is imminent and you know you won't outrun it. Then you raise one of your legs as high as you can and close your eyes. If you are still alive after the second it two it takes the wire to fall then you've got 25% more of chances to make it. With small hops while maintaining the raised leg as high as you can and specially without falling make your way as far from the wire as the length of the structure holding the wire above the ground plus a safety margin.\n\nIf you make it this far you have another 25% totalling 50%.\n\nThe other 50% was sorted out the moment the wire fell because it depends on the distance to the wire, the humidity of the air and the composition of the ground.\n\nBtw, there is special equipment for this where both shoes are connected by a wire that bridges through the pants and that you connect when you put them on. The shoes have an iron plate in their sole. \n\nHowever AC is very random.. I think only Tesla and maybe a handful of people have really understood it. Only a few people are rated to deal with live wires and then only if there's really no way around it.",

If two points connected by a conductive material have a difference in voltage, current flows between them.\n\nNow, if a very powerful point-source of voltage (like a fallen power-pole) is trying to pass current through a relatively poor but large conductor (like the ground) a funny thing happens. The voltage kinda spreads out. It creates a sort of field of potential, with the strongest voltage at the source, which tapers off towards the edges.\n\nThis field of voltage potential is lethal because even the short distance between your feet is enough to create a significant voltage differential. Remember, *any* difference in voltage between two points causes current to flow, so all it takes is for one foot to make contact at a higher voltage. One slightly closer to the source than the other. This causes extreme amounts of current to be drawn up through the legs and across the lower body. If it isn't enough to kill you outright, it's probably enough to cause you to fall.\n\nThat's why they tell you to hop on one foot or keep your feet close together, to minimize the possible voltage differential.",

All but one time, someone pulled me as soon as the swag was most of the way off the ground, so it only caught my leg and tripped me over, but one of them got me real well in just the way that one imagines from that story.\n\nAnother consideration is that the counterweight in this situation doubles as a mechanical lever, with these two functions serving to make the raising door a manageable weight. If it were truly counterweighted, they\u2019d need to actually push the lever up, rather than simply limiting the speed at which it rises.",

And what are the chances these traps are still active? You would imagine since they use some kind of potential energy, that a piece would fail in those 1000 years and release that energy.

People in Skyrim regularly brought offerings to their dead ancestors, including gold, gems, etc. \n\nRemember, it's not like the draugr have been around for very long. In Skyrim, at least, the draugr woke up and became active again around the time Alduin returned. Prior to the very start of the game, people in Skyrim could visit most of the more common tombs and burial grounds and leave offerings without being at risk of attack by draugr. Certain sites like Labrynthian or Ragnvald or some of the other Dragon Priest tombs that had explicit cursed places upon them would have still been dangerous and had draugr, but those were much rarer and not as likely to have visitors.",

                                    "comment": "Hey, uh, this isn't accurate. The existence of Draugr on Solstheim during Morrowind's 'Blood Moon' expansion over 200yr before Skyrim proves this to be a false explanation. The Nords mistakenly believed that the Draugr were cursed with undeath for serving the dragon cult but this isn't accurate either. What actually happened was that many worshipped the dragon cult and we're buried with the dragon priest they worshipped. When that dragon priest died, he transferred some of his life force to the Nord followers who would become undead to serve him and protect his grave. They would continue sleeping to keep their energy recharged and their skin became taut over centuries even with the best Nordic embalming.\n\nDragons rising did not bring back the Draugr. Bernadette Bantien's in-game book 'among the Draugr' goes into more detail iirc\n\nThe events of Skyrim do show Draugr guarding noble treasure etc but this can likely be explained by the Draugr being brought to those places later as an intentional defense mechanism. Most of the town burial sites like in whiterun don't have Draugr, and instead use skeletons to guard their stuff. The atmoran dragon cult was massive in Skyrim in the first era though, hence all the barrows where it can be assumed the dragon priest is no longer in a state that can be restored, unlike the ones we encounter throughout the game.\n\nSo if we assume these barrows were as uninterrupted as possible, the ancient tombs go back as far as 1E140, in Bromjunaar, and the septim empire wasn't founded until 2E 854 -- so I suppose that when we find gold it's an ancient coin that is 'exchanged offscreen'. Hence why they're called gold in game, and not septims. Septims are the empire's currency, but you don't pick up '3 septims', you pick up '3 gold'. It should be ancient coins, but this would have interacted with gameplay in a way the Devs probably decided was a hassle, whereas CDPR chose to make it a mechanic in Witcher.\n\nIt should be noted that what we see on screen in TES games is a simplified analogue of the 'real' thing -- whiterun has a population of like 80 people, solitude about the same, the bandit population is larger than the people in towns BC the game can't show us the full scope of an entire country and so gives us a glimpse of the scale. High Hrothgar is supposed to have 7000 steps and has like 400. Populations and scales shown in game, and limited by hardware and creative choices, are way smaller than the lore descriptions make them out to be (this is a canon explanation, not just pulled from thin air)",

And the chain is nearly in tension when the bridge is down? That is by design. It sets up as a \u201cvector pull\u201d , where you don\u2019t pull down on the chain to raise the bridge, you pull the line out of the plane it wants to naturally be in, exponentially increasing the force applied to both ends of the line (chain). (It\u2019s a technique used in rope access, rigging, or any trade that lifts and hauls large objects with ropes like ironworkers when a crane or chainfall or chain hoist isn\u2019t an option.\nhttps://www.cmcpro.com/the-vector-pull/ )\n\nThe resultant force on the drawbridge is much more than if you just pulled down on the chain. This gets it moving, at which point the counterweight is going to start applying more and more force- honestly once you really get it started, I wonder if there is a need for an arresting mechanism to stop the drawbridge from slamming closed too hard and damaging something else.",

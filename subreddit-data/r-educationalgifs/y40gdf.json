A grain of sand has an average mass of around 64mg (6.4x10^1) The Earth is roughly 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000mg (6\u00d710^30) so the Earth, at most, can consist of 1x10^29 grains of sand if it were only made of sand.\n\nMeaning, if there are 1x10^18 galaxies in the universe then there are more stars than there are grains of sand if Earth was made of nothing but sand. A trillion galaxies is only 1x10^12 (1,000,000,000,000) meaning there would need to be 1,000,000 times the number of galaxies we assume there are for that to be true.\n\nSo, moving on from there, how many grains of sand are on Earth? Well, the USGS estimates there are 7.5x10^18 grains of sand totalling 4.6x10^20mg (roughly 1/10,000,000,000 Earths mass.) If this is true, then there are roughly 10,000 time more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on Earth.",

For example a million dollars in cash is not unheard of but a trillion dollars in cash does not exist. A million million helps us imagine a million of something first and then think of what it would be to have a hundred, thousand and then a million of those somewhat making that number make sense.",

Aliens might be flying around in spaceships bending spacetime at will and travelling dimensions. People might actually be getting abducted. Space wars? Trade between civilisations? An alien deer like creature drinking out of a liquid metal lake? Fuck knows if its out there, but it could be. \n \nThere are theories and speculations about there being particles, or matter, that doesn't interact with light.. or anything we know of. Dark matter. What if there's an entire new table of dark elements? New materials, states of matter and literally new types of matter to play with and manipulate. Anything could be possible.",

Just to think that no matter how big or serious my problems might seem, I am part of that same ebb and flow that gave birth to the stars and allows me to type these words that are meeting your eyeballs right now.

Personally I think all we are is a brain that was formed over millions of years to be optimal for survival and our own thoughts and feelings are just parts of that\n\nEdit: i guess if we\u2019re talking about specifically the human brain it would be hundreds of thousands of years, not millions, but I just meant evolution from the first organisms",

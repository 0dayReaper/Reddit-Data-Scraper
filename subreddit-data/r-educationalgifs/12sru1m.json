As the screw is turned, water (red ball) is pushed up along the surface and out the top of the tube. This animation shows how it works.",

There are plenty of things thicker than water, which aren't being questioned. But there are few things that are less viscous than water, particularly in the era the Archimedes screw was invented. \n\nDo you have an example of something less viscous than water that would be readily used with an Archimedes screw?",

The tube is not completely filled with water so if you stopped the rotation the water would just sit there in the little \"pockets\" formed by the screw. The incline of the tube is also critical. In the diagram I've included of the paused gif I've added a red line. That red line indicates the maximum liquid level of that pocket where the red ball is. Any higher and the water would flow back down to the next pocket of the screw. That would be because the liquid level would be higher than the central core of the screw. I hope this helps you visualise the mechanism. \n\nThe final key to understanding the mechanism is that due to the screw rotating the pocket \"moves\" up the tube, thus bringing the ball/liquid with it, like in the gif. You could reverse the screw rotation and the liquid would go back down, still trapped in the pocket. \n\n[Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/vR5OWjF.jpg)",

The finer the tolerance the less water is lost between the screw/auger and the case/cylinder. Larger gaps will leak but that leak just flows to the screw below, which gets lifted with each turn. So leakage isn't as bad as it seems. Unless you have massive gaps of course and then there are issues. But as long as the rate of water in is greater than the leakage out the net result is still positive and the pump works.",

But too slow and it would not. This is a balancing act between gravity and the upwards force of the screw. The water level inside of the pipe would level out with the water level of the bucket it's standing in of the screw were not turning. \n\nThis levelling off is due to water pressure based on depth and can be seen in this diagram. All connected vessels will have the same water level. [Pascal vessels diagram](https://i.imgur.com/99BM4M6.jpg)",

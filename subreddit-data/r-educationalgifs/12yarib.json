If you're looking at a standard \"E\" vision test chart, the 20/20 line has letters which are 5 arc-minutes tall, or 5'.\n\nThe actual physical distance between those objects, if they were the same distance from earth, (hint: they are not) would be the distance from earth multiplied by the sin() of that angle, which would be around 0.0014 multiplied by the distance.\n\nBut in this case, \"close\" only means we see them together in the sky, even though one is a nebula 1200 light years away, and the other is a star (with a planet) only 64 light years from earth. But they appear in the same field of view in the telescope, which helps you find the right star, because M27 is more recognizable.",

On the other hand if you tell someone \"Look at N37, then the exoplanet is close to it, just 5 arc-minutes away\" then you're actually saying where to point the telescope. You're telling them which circle to look in.",

With adjustments to the signal in software like Photoshop or Pixinsight, one can all but eliminate the noise produced by the imaging chip on the camera. The line curve is how the signal to noise ratio changes the more frames one adds to the \"stack\".\n\nSo, one frame has tons of noise, but many stacked images have way less.\n\nThis is a VERY BASIC explanation of how the process of stacking for astrophotography works.

The data (900x10 seconds OSC) was captured as a byproduct while capturing an Exoplanet-Transit.This animation shows on the left single frames and on the right the cumulative median of the data, followed by the endresult (including color calibration and further denoising). In the lower plot you see the [SNR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) of each frame and of the cumulative stack. So yes, math still works :)",

That peak above the little bumps corresponds with whatever we are looking at. If you take an average you only get a line a little above the noise as the peak is such a small fraction.

And then you have the problem of newer AI being trained on images which themselves inaccurate. Some denoisers are able to give you a clean shot with only one frame, but that's because it's taking all the creative liberties it needs. That's only if memory serves me right.",

            "comment": "\u201cOn a voyage to Calcutta aboard the brig Corvo, Colt had the idea for a type of revolver while at sea, inspired by the capstan, or windlass, which had a ratchet and pawl mechanism which he would later say gave him the idea for his revolver designs. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment\u201d   \n\nWikipedia",

D. Sharkey provided technical assistance and 6,600 volts of power relayed from new General Electric AC generators in nearby Bay Ridge. Like so many local illuminating companies across the United States, the Brooklyn company used the Edison name because it originally employed the Edison system of electric power generation under license from the Edison Electric Light Co. of New York. In most cases, Edison had no personal role in the formation or direction of these companies. In 1903, he played no role in the direction of the Edison Electric Illuminating Co. of Brooklyn, which in any case was acting at the behest of officials at Luna Park in conjunction with the SPCA.\n\n&gt;Edison is not mentioned in any of the numerous contemporaneous newspaper accounts of the killing of Topsy. Nor is there any evidence that officials of Luna Park, the SPCA, or the Brooklyn Illuminating Co. consulted him on the case. It is also unlikely that he was personally involved in producing the film \u201cElectrocuting an Elephant,\u201d even though the title bears his name.",

But he was also a very well-connected businessman of the time, and that allowed him to exert influence in very unethical ways. He\u2019s notorious for the ways in which he ran a blatant smear campaign against Tesla and failed to keep his promises (that\u2019s the big one you\u2019ll often hear).\nBut he also had a few extremes like putting on public demonstrations wherein he would electrocute animals in an attempt to prove his direct current was superior to alternating current (also an underlying reason for his battle with Tesla) ALTHOUGH he was not present for the case of Topsy the elephant.\nHe was also known for claiming multiple innovations and inventions of those who worked for him, and generally \u201cJobsing it\u201d with poor treatment of his workers, although to be fair that was kind of the norm in those days.  \n\nEdison wasn\u2019t the devil, although he\u2019s often portrayed as such due to the Tesla feud. He was an extremely ambitious businessman who wanted to win at almost any cost. Later in life he actually admitted to as much, which is to be commended. A lot of his business practices were just very cutthroat and I\u2019m one of those biased Tesla lovers so take what I say with a grain of salt. \n\nHe contributed an enormous amount to society and technology, just often demonstrated poor ethics and morality along the way. It\u2019s also pretty common misconceptions concerning \u201cinvent vs improve\u201d, but that\u2019s true of anyone from him to the Wright Brothers (who weren\u2019t the first in flight, just the first to photograph it).",

Here's why:\nThink about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.\nAnd have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.\nNow I know what you're going to say: \"But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!\" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.\nImagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.\nI can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:\n\"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.\" And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.",

Calvary used to be armed with several of these, unloading them as they rode through enemy ranks. They always kept one loaded in case they were ambushed while trying to do their painfully slow reloads after every charge. \n\nAnd not to get too \"AcTuALly\" but the bullet is the hunk of metal that does out the barrel. The entire thing (case, bullet, powder, primer) is called a cartridge. The early ones were just powder and lead, wrapped in wax paper. Hence, paper cartridges. Once they started getting loaded into brass cases, they were called metallic cartridges to differentiate between the two because different guns could only use one or the other.  :)",

In that case, it would theoretically help keep the firing pins from breaking. \n\nIt probably wouldn't be so much of an issue with caps and nipples, since there are no extra moving parts, but it could possibly an issue with firing pins.",

When the potential (difference in charge) reaches a certain threshold it triggers the neuron to fire. If the neuron synapses with itself when it fires it will either release excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter (which one just depends on the connection, what determines it is well beyond me). If it's excitatory it will make it more likely the neuron fires again (this can help cause feedback loops) and if it's inhibitory it will make it less likely.  \n  \nThis is a really bad explanation, I may try to come back and do better when I have more time.",

The summation of all input with respect to proximity to the origination of the signal determines the neurons ability to propagate its action potential.",

The only information you have to communicate is the ball. So you pass the ball around. And all you can really determine between you and the person next to you is ball or not ball.\n\nTo augment that and transfer more information that's actually useable, you can pass the ball at different speeds. And to make matters confusing. The energy in the room affects the balls passing speed. So if everyone is really energetic, bouncing and having a good time (excitatory), you pass the ball quicker. Some people are downers. And they slow the ball down (inhibitors). \n\nFinally, you're limited in who you can pass a ball to by the connections between you and them. So you can only pass to your friend Frank, and your other friend Sarah can only pass the ball to you (Neural connections formed by the dendrites you see in the gif above). \n\nSo say that Sarah is really down. But she still passes you the ball. Now your response is inhibited. You slow down. And you throw a weaker ball to Frank. Frank now knows that your response is less significant. And can use that ball and the one he got from his other friend Jeff, which was also inhibited, to determine that the balls you're passing around aren't important right now. \n\nIf you take this process and multiple each factor, number of neural connections, number of neurons, and number of balls, by some very large number in the order of millions, so that balls are being passed around multiple times a second by millions of neurons connected to each other; you begin to approach a useful level of information flow that allows for functions in the brain at speeds that are relevant to our world. Such as writing an analogy of balls being thrown around. Or reading, or eating, or any and all of the other things your brain has to process on any given day. \n\nThat said. This is a wild oversimplification that glosses over some irrelevant parts and stream lines many more. But I think it does ok for anyone mildly interested in the subject. And if for some reason I have messed this up in part of my analogy, someone feel free to correct me.",

Reddit focuses on *what* is being said and who you are is secondary. Less focus on DP etc.\n\nOf course, the upvote count becomes a proxy for popularity and that's where the hivemind problem takes over.

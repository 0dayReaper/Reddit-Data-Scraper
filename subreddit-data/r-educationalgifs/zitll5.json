But now as we can observe and study the phenomenon we can develop new knowledge from it and apply it elsewhere or develop new techniques for maybe different surfaces or metals used. \n\nThis is fascinating in my opinion as it shows humanity's scientific progress lol. I mean, I think we should be focusing more of our energy in developing such miniature events so we can develop actual techniques instead of finding the n-th algorithm for social media to push you to consume. \n\nSomething like that idk",

I think about how much we've lost due to shifting values and technology - and more so, perhaps ultimately, from cultural hegemony. \n\nThere's always an ebb and flow of knowledge, but the 20th century was a terrible time for the preservation of traditional knowledge and progression, probably in part because of progress. Education is largely to blame, teachers can't keep up and themselves never knew what they didn't know. \n\nJust yesterday I was relating my curiosity for the Arabian mathematicians'and tradesmen's motivation to invent algebra. Largely I think the story behind the discovery is lost because it's not valued as much as the resulting technology, but we lose our sense of humanity too. \n\nAnyway, you should check out Machine Thinking on YouTube, I bet you'd really enjoy it.",

Can do up to 20K fps if you want to see wire probe.\nThe cavitar laser is 640 or 810nm light so the bandpass filter is notched around plus minu 10nm each side so only laser light used to light the scene, this way most of the bright light from torch etc is filtered out\n2nd one is done with cavilux HF laser",

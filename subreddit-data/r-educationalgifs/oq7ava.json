You do however have to shop in an area that can support a haberdasher whom can actually run the devices necessary to do said fitting. I can assure you most of those artesian do not work for 20 dollars a go. The man in this video is a real expert and likely sells hats well into the 4-5 figures. Those hats are sold with custom fitting as a given, not an extra.",

When the wing-nuts are tightened, the ridged keys may then be used to shape a custom hat.\n\nhttps://www.garydawsondesigns.com/store/p9/Conformer-Formillion.html",

They'll pump a time or two into the hat, then gently put it on your head.  They find the too-tight locations and then steam it some more and gently pull the tight areas. Then just steam, fit, and adjust until it fits correctly.\n\nDon't try this at home unless you know what you are doing. You CAN steam a hat to fit it but it's very easy to destroy the material.",

They were right near a hotel that hosted a lot of conventions, so big business men would come in to buy hats and boots. They had an old Cadillac front end that had been painted gold as a counter, and the girls who steamed hats would work behind the Cadillac. \n\nIt was a big deal to get your hat steamed by some young woman in a gold Cadillac. The whole place was set up to be an experience rather than a store. They had an area cleared out for line dancing and they gave out free alcohol while you were there. Basically a party every day.",

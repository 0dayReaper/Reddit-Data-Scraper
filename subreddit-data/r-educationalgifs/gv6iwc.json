It was creating problems for the obvious reason that there was nowhere for the brain to grow.\n\nEach one had reconstruction where roughly the top half of their skull was cut off, cut and rearranged to allow for appropriate growth, then reattached. One twin one day, the other twin another day. Seeing the brain exposed like that, especially in one so young, was quite unnerving. To be clear, a _lot_ of planning went into this, it wasn't a weekend of pondering and \"welp let's see how this goes in the OR\" thinking.\n\nIt was both horrifying and fascinating at the same time. Like, I'm glad someone really smart figured out a solution, but that had to have been a very difficult decision for the parents.",

                                                    "comment": "For the FTM surgeries you mention, the first is called phalloplasty (constructing of a phallus) and there are various modifications. For example, the testicle implants are optional as is the pump. The skin graft comes from different places depending on where you are (in the UK it is typically the forearm). \n\nThe second you mention is called metoidioplasty \u2014 testosterone causes the \u201cclitoris\u201d to enlarge, and metoidioplasty severs the skin holding the growth to the body, so the growth is more like a cis penis. It has full sensation and can be, depending on the amount of growth from T, be used to some extent for penetrative sex. Testicular implants can also be added here. I also believe that you can get urethral lengthening here to be able to pee standing up. \n\nCheckout jammidodger on youtube for more info!",

Not worse than being sick and you get past that.

I could breath through it but I felt like I wasn't really getting enough air from it.\n\n\nIf you want to do it yourself I recommend doing a bit of research to find a good plastic surgeon.

If you go to a good plastic surgeon, the results will be subtle and natural looking. If you're really worried, you could always tell people that you have a deviated septum and are getting a rhino while they're in there, or that you broke it as a kid and always wanted to get it fixed. But I promise that no one will care or even notice, most likely.",

The heart beats on its own and mostly functions on its own, although the brain has some level of influence over it (speeding up or slowing your heartbeat either through your nervous system or through hormones (such as adrenaline, etc)). This is how, when a person is braindead, the heart continues pumping on its own.\n\nThe same is not true for the lungs however for example. When you're in a coma, it's basically mandatory for a breathing tube to be put into you (securing the airway since you have no gag or swallow reflex) and a ventilator to breathe for you, because your respiratory system might be severely depressed.",

This is very reductive, but a good enough explanation for this purpose. \n\nB) It's a legal issue. Usually the next of kin wishes to keep their loved one alive even if there is a 99.9% guarentee the patient will not regain any neural function. It's hard to lose someone, even more hard when that someone still can grasp your hand, breathe, make sounds out of their mouth, or other primitive reflexes that exist not from the brain but the spinal cord or brain stem. In my experience it takes a couple days or even a month for loved ones to truly accept their isn't going to be a miracle.",

It's not common in young people to have atrial arrhythmias but it becomes increasingly common as you age (e.g. AFib has a prevalence of about 25% above age 80). It makes a ton of sense to ablate it.",

                    "comment": "An EKG takes an electrical tracing of the heart\u2019s activity over a few beats. There are multiple electrical leads placed at various positions around he heart. Each pair of leads can capture the heart\u2019s electrical activity. We typically use 12 leads for a standard ekg to get a look at what the heart is doing from multiple angles. In med school and residency, you learn how to interpret these. Some soecialties use them more than others (cardiology obviously using them the most). \n\nT waves are tracings seen on an ekg that indicates ventricular repolarization (the cells in the bottom part of the heart are recharging to get ready to squeeze again). \n\nMost EKGs have a section called the precordial leads. These show you what\u2019s going on as viewed from the front of the heart. It\u2019s normal for t wave to be upside down or inverted in children due to differences in how their heart is shaped. As we grow older and our physiology becomes more standard adult physiology, those t waves usually flip and point upward. It\u2019s normal for the first precordial lead (V1) to never flip over. If someone is an adult and any of the t waves are upside down other than V1, that\u2019s an inverted t wave. \n\nDamage to hear muscle cells or lack of blood flow can change the way this electrical activity looks. That\u2019s why doctors diagnose things using an ekg. Inverted t waves can be a sign of stress or death to the heart muscle cells. But they can also be normal. It\u2019s all about the context of what\u2019s going on with the patient that let\u2019s us know if we need to worry about it or not. So we call this a nonspecific finding. \n\nIn general, inverted t waves are super duper common. It\u2019s when they weren\u2019t there before and suddenly appear that we get a little more nervous.\n\nIn this diagram, you can see the green line is the ekg tracing of the heart. The other lines are pressure tracings, so are outside the scope of this discussion. Notice that when the marker gets to the t wave on that green line, the ventricles (bottom part of the heart) are recharging and relaxed. That\u2019s the T wave you\u2019re referring to.",

Well it's considered a non-specific finding, which is just the medical way of saying it doesn't really mean any one thing. You see them commonly in patients who are either having a heart attack OR have had a heart attack in the past.\n\nFortunately, they can also be seen in patients with no serious underlying disease. The most common cause in those people is probably lead misplacement (i.e. The tech placed the EKG leads too high on your chest so the vectors are backwards).\n\nThe odds in your case are hard to say without knowing your full medical history, risk factors, etc. For that reason, just follow the guidance of the PCP/cardiologist who told you!",

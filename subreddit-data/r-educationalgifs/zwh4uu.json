He spent a week in hospital and was then released, with a date for his by-pass. 2 weeks after he came out of the hospital, he had his 3rd attack and he was \"dead\" in the ambulance. He was operated on three times in 24 hours (arterial leaks kept happening due to the blood thinners he was on).\n\nHe spent a few weeks in a medically induced coma in the ICU and we were warned that he was dying so we all had to come and say our goodbyes.\n\nBut - he got better and they woke him up. He was then sent to the cardiac ward where he spent 3 months before he got sent to physio rehab and there he was for 4 months before he came back home.\n\nHe never got his memory back from about mid Nov 2002 until March 2003 - so he did not remember my sister telling him that he was going to be a grandad for the first time. \n\nWe should have lost him that night of his 3rd heart attack, so the next 18 years were a gift. A gift that was worth everything else we lost during those years.",

So obviously the main goal of compressions is to circulate blood, but when you compress the chest you're also compressing the entire chest cavity, including the lungs. This creates positive pressure inside the chest cavity similar to exhalation. So for each compression when you come back up, that makes a little bit of negative pressure which draws air in. While it's not as good as a full breath delivered by a BVM or through a tube, the benefits of keeping circulation far outweigh the getting full breaths. There a lot of physiology I'm skipping over so it's definitely worth it to look into for your own understanding.\n\n  \n\n\nThe end all, unless the person you're doing compressions on tells you to stop, don't stop unless you're swapping out with someone else.",

If not doing breaths I guess there wouldn\u2019t be much point of counting compressions as you\u2019ll want to continue doing them at 100-120 compressions per minute until you are relieved or are unable to continue.",

Especially if someone else is within range, they should be sent to fetch a nearby AED while compressions are continued.\n\nCompressions send oxygenated blood to the brain which is the sole objective. If the brain does not receive oxygenated blood, it rapidly starts dying off and all the patient will be at that point is an organ donator.\n\nSomeone in cardiac arrest can basically be in 4 major rhythms, of which an AED only has a chance of interrupting 2 - subsequently putting them into a non-shockable rhythm, asystole to be more precise (what you see as a \"flatline\" in TV). Thats basically a completely knocked out heart, which, at least, gives you a chance of pounding it back to a working state.\n\nOf course, without an AED you won't knock someone out of those fucked up rhythms. But at least your continued compressions will keep them \"alive\". If you are alone or an AED is not nearby, but EMS is on their way, you will have an AED on scene sooner than later, so don't worry about it and keep pumping. \n\nEverything I just said is focussed on medically induced cardiac arrest (think heart attack or congenital heart defects). Traumatic arrests are an entirely different beast, and things like drownings, which again have different algorithms, place different priorities accordingly (in drownings, initial rescue breaths make sense)",

I wouldn't for a stranger but for a friend or family member I'm doing rescue breaths. You can mitigate the infection risk with a rescue breaths mask. They have a one way valve that prevents the patients exhalation from making contact and it makes a better seal so the breaths are more effective.",

You will likely never use it, but it\u2019s an amazing tool to have in your toolbox.\n\nRemember, if you\u2019re doing CPR on someone they have already died. Your job now is to pause the dying process long enough to either get an AED there to shock them (if they have a shockable heart rhythm) or until they can get to an operating table. CPR has a very low success rate for a cardiac arrest, but it\u2019s the only chance that person may have of being brought back from the dead. \n\nGo sign up for a class now!

I always sort of put each hand inward on a 45\u00b0ish turn with my left hand over my right and fingers curled under. It feels very natural in that position, especially if you end up continuing for 30+ minutes.\n\nMaybe they recommend this so that people also don\u2019t try and use a flat hand with their fingers open. You would have a lot less force applied this way vs fingers under and creating less surface area to which the force is applied.\n\nAt the end of the day, all that matters is that someone actually steps up and pushes on that chest. Many times I arrived in a scene with nobody doing compressions. These very expectantly have poor outcomes. A good amount of my successful resuscitations started with bystander CPR, even if it looked to be of less than good quality. As long as that heart was compressing just enough, we had a shot at keeping that brain alive and having something viable to work with cardiac wise.\n\nIf anyone is every unsure of the proper procedure and positioning at the time, which can easily happen during a high stress situation like this, just aim for the center of the sternum and start push however you can at the time. You may get a feel for what you\u2019re doing and remember parts of your CPR training as you go. Just get pushing and don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t even worry about mouth to mouth. As long as their mouth is open and you\u2019re pushing their chest hard enough, air will still move, and you\u2019ll still be circulation blood that still has some oxygen in it.\n\nKudos to anyone who has ever stepped up to do CPR in an emergency. Not everyone does nor are they willing to sometimes. So do your best and it is more than okay to not be doing compressions 100% perfect.",

Recent studies show that chest compressions are more important, particularly for witnessed cardiac arrests where the blood is still well-oxygenated. That, combined with peoples\u2019 reluctance to do mouth to mouth or good mask ventilations, means that many agencies are moving towards a \u201ccontinuous compressions\u201d model that ignores ventilations entirely. (Note this is for bystanders/lifeguards/first responders, not emergency services)",

The first time I had to do CPR was only a few months after I did the course and somehow still had that muscle memory in me and felt the chest just give away after the first couple compressions and I didn't think anything of it in the moment. He didn't survive and after I played that whole event back through my head after, I was convinced I killed him. \n\nMessed me up for a few months until I was chatting with an EMT who was nonchalant about those first couple compressions and about what happens. \n\nHe described that chest compressions, when done correctly, be forceful and deep enough that you might feel stuff breaking. That the heart needs that squeeze to actually do what CPR is supposed to do. And that ribs almost quite literally get in the way.",

Wondering if I did it correctly, secretly thinking I could've done better and saved him. It tore me apart but I was too scared to look it up. \n\nI only found out weeks ago that something like 9 out of 10 people who suffer cardiac arrest outside of a hospital end up not making it. And that typically CPR after a massive cardiac event is only a means of maintaining perfusion, it will not start the person's heart again like they show on TV. \n\nI know this is deeply personal to my experience and my emotions are just my own but I would've preferred to know the actual statistics beforehand. So the way you're looking at it is depressing and I understand that but there's another side to knowing the facts.",

You have to push down so deep that the heart pushing down against the spine is the only thing stopping you. So at least 7cm deep. Don't be afraid to break anything, cause that's when you know you're doing it right. Making a heart pump by pushing on the outside of the body takes a huge amount of force. We are literally built to not let that happen. That's why we got a cage of bones around the heart and lungs. \n\nSource: second in command on a volunteer search and rescue boat",

Better than being dead.\n\nCPR is also exhausting, you'll either have to deal with the discomfort or if there's other people around swap out who's performing it. When swapping, make sure the pumps are continuous. \n\nAnd finally, the odds of surviving a major cardiac collapse is slim. CPR increases it, but if they die it's not gonna be because you screwed up.",

I called 911 while I was giving him cpr. I don\u2019t have any training I just remembered seeing shit on Reddit about doing it to the beat of \u201cStaying Alive\u201d and how you have to press down really hard to the point of breaking ribs. I remember feeling his pulse come back and the medics coming in soon after and giving him narcan. It\u2019s crazy but I honestly learned a lot of live saving tips from Reddit man. My brothers okay now, he isn\u2019t a drug addict he just parties every once in a while and took some fentanyl laced pills.",

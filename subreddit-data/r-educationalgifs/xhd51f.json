    "title": "Reindeer have a formidable defense strategy when faced with a perceived threat. They will sometimes form \"cyclones\" as the herd begins walking together in a tight-knit circular fashion to deter a predator, like a bear, that may come near. This behavior is also practiced by reindeer kept in corrals.",

Apparently a native tribe up near the arctic in Europe herd the wild reindeer into these cyclones and take biological samples to see how contaminated they still are.  Almost 40 years later and the widespread environmental impact in Europe is still evident from Chernobyl.",

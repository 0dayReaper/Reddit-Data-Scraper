When ejaculation occurs there are MILLIONS of sperm VS MILLIONS of white blood cells. But the white blood cells won't actually kill as much sperm as just being in a foreign place. White blood cells have to locate and attack which takes time, while sperm slowly deteriorate by just being outside the body. By the time they get to the egg their outer body is literally torn and half alive. But the hardest part is now here, they have to physically ram into a giant egg and break through which kills a vast majority of them.\n\nWhile a lower immune system does help with getting pregnant, it would actually trigger other complications in the body that would make getting pregnant even harder. The white blood cells are such a small barrier to pregnancy than everything else that could go wrong.",

Humans do not have this kind of biological control -- rather, the fetus in humans takes what it wants, mother be damned. \n\nPregnancy is absolutely goddamned terrifying.",

It's so sad and  I feel for them. While for us it was effortless they had to go through countless tests and diets and what not. Now, they are working on artificial insemination.\n\nFrom what they told me it's basically when  low sperm count  meets  strong immune system. Sperm has hard time to fertilize the egg",

His sperm count appeared normal and her egg samples showed they were viable to conceive but it never happened.

There\u2019s always been the option of IVF, but they\u2019re religious sensibilities have been that of God wants them to be blessed with children it will happen on its own. It\u2019s the same when anyone in our family has mentioned adoption, they feel that if it fell in their lap- literally a baby on the doorstep situation-it\u2019s a sign from God but they won\u2019t go seeking it.\n\nSince then, their personalities have changed quite drastically. Both are struggling with alcoholism and depression. They\u2019re both the sweetest people in the world with big hearts, and it\u2019s sad to see them go down this road.",

It's a huge deal and it's one of the most incredible and unique holidays anywhere.\n\nThe marathon kicks off early in the morning in Hopkington, and ends in Back Bay / Copley Square downtown.\n\nThe entire route is lined with people. \n\n*The ENTIRE* route. \n\nPeople cheer for anyone and everyone. Passing by a college is super loud, and kids get up and hold up clever signs.\n\nAlso the Sox play at home at 11am (weather permitting) that day, so right about the time the larger groups of better runners start passing through Kenmore Square down Comm Ave, the gates that were once 5 deep cheering are suddenly met with a deluge of 38,000 Fenway Faithful.\n\nALL the bars along the route are packed with people who got there at 8am to claim their spot.\n\nEveryone cheers. You might not know anyone running but you're just cheering for people to make it. And the finish line coming down Comm Ave, Right onto Hereford St, left onto Boyslton, is a thundering sense of applause as the crowd gets you through the last 1/4 mile. It's just awesome. \n\nMarathon Monday in Boston is an incredible and unique experience.",

There's no purse, so the winning time isn't amazing, and they leave the \"bridge\" (do or die point at 20 miles in) open for almost 6 hours, so your window to complete it is huge.\n\nI finished (with the breakneck pace of 5:55... as in almost 6 hours, not a sub-6 minute mile) in front of ~12,000 or so entrants of the 32,000 running that year. There were people lining the whole route, including two groups with kegs handing out shots of beer after the bridge. Wonderful experience, and I can now say I did a marathon.\n\nI *did* a marathon. I did not *run* a marathon.",

However there are mile times the preclude running, 16 minutes is one of them, that's walking.\n\nI respect his/her attitude of completing a marathon vs running a marathon.\n\n",

Then my running partner had surgery and I didn't put my running shoes back on until the day before, when I attended the Rally to Restore Sanity and logged about 10 miles of walking. Then the next day I ran about 10k of the marathon, turned toward my siblings (one of whom had trained, the other of whom hadn't), and in my best G.O.B. voice, said \"I have made... a huge... mistake\" and started walking.",

You can feel like you're there because I *was* there, and being there is special.\n\nThere's just something special about that day. Maybe it's how the city swells with people from literally all over the world. Maybe it's because you know your buddies in NYC and Philly and LA all have to work that day. Maybe it's because it's one of the few times a Bloody Mary at 8:45am on a Monday in April doesn't make you an alcoholic, it makes you 45 mins behind schedule.\n\nBut the city *feels* like something.\n\nThe best Marathon Monday was the year after the bombings. There was something like fifteen or twenty thousand more runners that year because they allowed everyone who didn't get to finished the year before to re-run. And everyone was running for something, and running more than proving something to themselves, they were running against not just their own fear, but fear itself.\n\nI went to the Sox game with my buddies that day, as is tradition.\n\nAnd it was just gorgeous out.\n\nLike every year, the big screen at Fenway has a small sidebar that shows the standings in the Marathon for everyone at the game to follow. The Kenyans were all among the top, as they always are. But in first was an Eritrean named Meb, who was an American Citizen running with the American Flag next to his name. They kept flashing to him and the stadium cheered.\n\nAn American of any stripe hasn't won the Boston Marathon in what, thirty years? What are the ods. Let's stay focused on the game guys. \n\nBut he's not falling back.\n\nAnd then the big screen cuts the game to Meb turning right onto Hereford St, and then left onto Boylston. The final stretch. Lined by buildings and crowds. I wouldn't be surprised if Fenway could hear the crowd on Boylston, and Boylston could hear everyone at the Sox game cheering.\n\nI don't even think the Umps called a time out in the game, everyone just stopped and watched. \n\nThe batter put his bat down, the Center Fielder turned to the screen and watched with his glove on his hip.\n\nAnd goddamnit, Meb did it. That sand bagging sonofabitch. We watched as they placed the laurel wreath on his head and he wrapped himself in an American flag and cried. We all cried. Ever look around and smile at people without saying anything? It was that.\n\nHigh fives, USA chants, goosebumps, and smiles.\n\nA year after Boston was a War Zone it was soo full of love.\n\nI don't even remember the final score, but goddamn I love that holiday.",

I grabbed the owner, a buddy of mine, and bought a round for them. He laughed and said that they would be fine: Regulars were leaving $5, $20, even $100 with the checks for any first responder that walked through the door. \n\nGod damn, if there was any group of people that deserved a Duck Boat parade, it was all the men &amp; women that answered the call that day. \n\n\"This is our fucking city.\" - David Ortiz",

I am a marathon runner, just completed by 7th three days ago in Vermont.\n\nI will not run Boston.  It is a logistic nightmare for mid pack runners.  You are dicking around on buses and at the start for hours before your corral gets to go.  Remember it is point to point, so no family with you for support at the start.  This year, it was a torrential rain, further exasperating the misery before mid pack Joe could even take a running step.  There are a lot of people, so the course never thins out.  The roads are not great.  Navigating train tracks at Cleveland Circle and a minefield of potholes can be rough.\n\nAnd this is the biggest for me, probably because I have a roaring case of class rage...IMHO the race is elitist.   Qualifying times that are not qualifying times \\(\"oh, this year you have to be 2:30 under what we list as a qualifying time \\- don't like it?  Tough shit.\"\\)  Large charity requirements \\(min of $5k, many are $10k \\- \"aren't able to squeeze enough out of your friends/family?  That's ok, we'll just charge your credit card the difference.\"\\)\n\nIf you are the 5\\-6 hour runner that some folks are mentioning in this thread?  Hate to tell you but that great atmosphere is long gone.  In many cases they are rolling up the aid stations as you go running by and the crowd is non\\-existent.\n\nI watch, I support people that do it, but I will never run it.  There are great marathons out there, MCM, Big Sur, even Pittsburgh, but for some reason this BQ time bullshit is in every marathoners head.",

Warning, some elitism ahead ;\\)\n\nThere are a lot of marathons out there for people to run if they want to simply cross \"complete a marathon\" off their bucket list. MCM, Big Sur, &amp; NYC are all great options. Boston isn't one of them. You have to earn it. \n\nYou can't just sign up on a whim, half\\-ass the training, walk for half of it, and show off your 6 hour marathon medal on your social media of choice. You have to train and train hard, you have to really want it. You have to sacrifice time with family and friends. You have to get up early on the weekends and even earlier on weekdays to fit in the necessary miles. It's not easy. It's that sacrifice and hard work that every runner makes that puts Boston in a special category.\n\nBoston is great *because* of the qualifying times. When you say you qualified for and ran Boston, it means something special. Most runners, and in New England \\-\\- most non\\-runners, know that just qualifying in itself is a huge achievement. This is part of why the crowds are so great. Everyone knows that all of the runners at Boston pushed themselves that much harder, sacrificed that much more, and are completing a goal that they've likely been dreaming about for years, not months.",

The charities themselves pass on the spots to runners who contribute money, or who are sponsored by someone who contributes money.  These charity runners do not have to beat the racing qualification time cutoff, so it's an alternative way for runners who reeeeally want to participate but can't compete well enough.  Another tenth of the spots are given to sponsors, running clubs and city departments to issue as they please.\n\nThe number of runners applying to race keeps increasing each year.  When I was younger, there used to be 6-7,000 runners out of perhaps 10,000 qualified applicants.  Now, there are 30,000 runners out of 100,000 qualified applicants, so the cutoff keeps excluding more and more runners who are capable and want to participate.  Charity spots are a good way to do that.\n\nAll of the non-qualifying runners start the race at the back of the pack.",

It's on a lot of peoples' bucket lists, that's for damn sure.\n\nIt's kind of hard to explain to people that you're willing to essentially make running a part-time job, running super hard to try and hit your peak in order to hopefully be in the right shape to shoot for a BQ. It's just an awesome thing to set your sights on, and the times are super tough for most runners. \n\nA couple weeks ago I did a half marathon with some people I worked with, and they were all congratulating me on my time. I felt funny because all I have in my mind is the marathon down the road where I'll hopefully be able to make a legitimate BQ attempt. ",

And the rest of the folks are likely [volunteers,](http://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/event-information/volunteer-information/volunteer-job-descriptions.aspx) maybe with one BAA staff person there to supervise.  \n\nThey have to set up crossings at a lot of intersections too.  I believe they don't actually start letting people cross this way until a lot of people have already passed by.  The GIF is from Beacon St. right before Kenmore I think, so pretty close to the end of the course, so people are much more spread out.",

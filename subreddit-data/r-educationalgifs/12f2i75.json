            "comment": "[Heron of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria) was a Greek-Egyptian mathematician and inventor who lived in the 1st century AD. One of his inventions were automatically opening temple doors, powered by a fire altar and a hydraulic system.\n\nThe automated temple doors are described in his writings as invention \u201cnumber 37\u201d. The idea was, that temple doors should open automatically when a fire is lit and close again, when the fire distinguishes. By lighting the fire above ground in an altar in front of the temple, heat would form and build up pressure into a soldered vessel beneath the temple. The liquid within the vessel (probably water, but Heron also thought about quicksilver) would get pushed through a hose into another vessel hanging from the ceiling and connected to the underground doorposts of the temple doors.\n\nBy the added weight, the second vessel would pull the ropes attached to the door posts and the doors would open \u201cmagically\u201d for the spectators. When the fire extinguishes and the heat passes, the liquid would get sucked back into the first vessel, the second vessel would become lighter and the well-balanced counter-weight would pull in the other direction to close the doors.\n\n[Source of the gif and the info](https://www.artefacts-berlin.de/portfolio-item/heron-of-alexandira-automated-temple-doors/)\n\n[More info](https://www.greecehighdefinition.com/blog/2019/10/5/first-automatic-door-invented-in-ancient-greece-3d-video-presentation-the-history-of-the-worlds-first-automatic-door)\n\nEd.

What Heron should have thought of is to have a spring loaded transition plate where the closed door is, and have that connected to a gate valve inside the \u201chose\u201d. So that someone can only step onto the plate if the door was open, and if they stand on the plate the gate valve closes, preventing the flow back from the second vessel into the first, locking the door in place until they step off the transition plate.",

That is the purpose of any type of automation, from a pencil, to a printing press, to a camera, to automated industrial machines and so on; to replace processes that otherwise wouldn't change much on their own. Ultimately, just because these technologies take place, it doesn't mean it's going to remove everything. Otherwise, why are people still doing manual arts when they were automated hundreds of years ago, and still continue to do so? Why would anyone engage in manual tiring work, when there are already things in place that can already do it? Because artistic expression and skill demonstration is what humans like to do, regardless if there are easier ways to do so.\n\nMachine learning and neural networks are a specific group of tools for us to enhance everything we do, in the same manner Microsoft Office and other software enhances people's jobs at the workplace.",

This starts with our ability to burnish wood into hardened spear points and canoes, progresses into metallurgy for pouring bronze and brass, progressing into refining iron ore, into smelting iron in to wrought iron, into carburising iron, to crucible steel, to plate steel, heat treatment, etc. \n\nMost of the advancements were made when we discovered how to make more consistent fire (bigger fireplaces with the right airflow), hotter fire (different sources of fuel), cleaner fire (introduction of less impurities into the material) or temperature controlled fire (not too hot and not too cold for chemical/physical or metallurgical purposes).",

Electric welders and soldering irons are relatively young versions of the process for us. And if you really want to be pedantic about this, fire would be better classified as thermal energy production and control. \n\nWhile harnessing the kinetic energy (i.e. motion) of wind and power has helped in scaling up technology, we can certainly state that making hotter/better fires has helped us unlock new ways of working metal and using said metal for new applications. Among which are purification of metals so we can make better conducting wires, cresting ceramic electronic parts etc. \n\nVery modern is the energy used from Radioactive decay. While the bombs are infamous, from archeology to medical applications we use a lot of nuclear fission. \n\nThen there is potential energy (things falling from heights)which we use to slam pillars into the ground to build housing, we like storing energy in chemicals. But as far as I know no form of energy has impacted our ability to create new technologies as hard as our harnessing thermal energy from making increasingly hotter and more controlled fire.",

A cup of hot tea doesn't shrink to half its size when it gets cold.\n\nI am guessing there is a lot of air above the stored water, and when the water is heated the air gets hot and expands too. This would push the water downwards, then through the tube, and into the second basin.",

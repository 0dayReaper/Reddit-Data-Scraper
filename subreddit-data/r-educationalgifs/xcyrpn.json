I reached (not hard, just reached) out to my right and that was it. I had to yell for my helper to get me off the ladder, because I couldn't even take a step down. Lucky I had a helper that day, and that I wasn't up more than about 3 steps. He pretty much picked me up and deposited me on the ground. I was incapacitated for a couple of days after that. I have to admit, now that I really think about it, that my spine was probably not the problem. It was probably a muscle tear or spasm, and I have had similar things happen to me a handful of times since. But trust me, it sucks to get old.",

After many years of regular strength training and focussing on optimizing recovery through as many pathways as possible, I'd credit yoga for the biggest positive impact it's made in my day to day life. My body feels better, my movements are smoother and easier on the joints, my mind is calmer, my muscles and joints recover faster from any stress caused to them and I sleep better. 15-20 minutes 3 times a week can make a big impact, 15-20 minutes a day an even bigger one. If you feel like you wanna give it a shot but have no idea where to start, feel free to hit me up.",

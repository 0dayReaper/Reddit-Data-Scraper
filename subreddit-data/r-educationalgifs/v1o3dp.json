If it starts to pull away, I\u2019m taking the angle too sharp, and I need to correct it.So I just pull ahead until I reach that distance again, and then correct. No need to pull all the way out and start over.\n\nIt\u2019s basically the video, as I\u2019m watching it, though that first turn I don\u2019t take as far. I sorta turn the wheel and straighten out a bit to stay aligned to the parked car, and then turn the wheel in the other direction once my bumper will clear the parked car\u2019s. More like an \u201cS\u201d. but I only ever look at where my car is in relation to that bumper. And, like I said, the closer to the other car, the smaller the space I can get into.\n\nWhen I had my little Dodge Neon, I could park that car like a Mentos commercial.",

I bought a tiny car because in NYC a parking spot that big almost never comes up.\n\nI remember the first time I parked my car I was so happy coming from a normal sedan to a Scion made me feel like I could park in any spot in the entire city. I always laugh when a normal sized car passes up a spot because it's too small and I just pop right in.\n\nI'll also never understand why people think parking is so hard. I would prefer to parallel park than a normal parking lot. Hell I even parallel parked a Jeep last time I was in CA. I was so proud of myself.",

As you\u2019re backing into the space, get that rear wheel sorted and then just focus on not bumping the car in front as you pivot in. It\u2019s not foolproof because you can still come in too strong (pivot into front car) or come in too shallow (not have enough room behind you to pivot in), but I love that little hard fast truth that you can\u2019t change that wheel once it\u2019s in place",

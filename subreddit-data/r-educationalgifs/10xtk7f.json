Redditors also have a misguided sense of what is good. Social justice becomes mob justice around  here on the daily.\n\nOh and most gaming subreddits are unusable most days of the week.

Real analysis on the MCAT, marine biologists telling young people how to actually get into the field, real entrepreneurs discussing everything from bitcoin in 2009 to Shopify reselling online. You could get real HR consultants telling people how to actually navigate modern job searching/HR issues, you could get real artists sharing actual art school level information with other budding artists, and on and on\n\nWell this is still true, it's just bigger. But at no point did any of this go away. it's bigger than ever, you can still become part of communities that have niche interests and learn a lot. I've even met some people IRL as a result of being in those. \n\nInternet is monetized because people use it, but for every grifter there's another 5 earnest people who now have a way to make a buck from their efforts. Open source software still thrives, etc. \n\nBing can't write a cover letter but at least it can tell me how to write SQL without being condescending.",

It is a fault system that accommodates movement across hundreds of individual faults and we cannot predict which fault will move next (or even if a weakness in previously solid rock will lead to a new fault).  So while we can identify a risky region (in this case the East Anatolian fault zone), we can't point to a single house and say: \"well that one is fucked\"\n\n\\- where we can predict zones with high risk, people are generally unwilling to relocate after already settling.  Even in wealthy locations.  Florida is a huge flood risk under rising sea levels and San Francisco is an earthquake disaster waiting to happen but we don't move elsewhere.",

I've seen one tornado in that time, when I was in my early 30s, and it was a tiny EF0 sliver that never touched the ground. The next closest was an EF-1 (or 2, depending on the timeline) that went about 3 blocks from my house a year ago, but I didn't actually see it. Most of us in the region never get within 10 miles of a tornado, much less get any damage or injury from one.\n\nWith that said, my wife has survived THREE direct or glancing blow hits from two EF-5s and an EF-4 (two in Moore and one in Newcastle), so you never know, I guess. My two teen stepsons have been through more tornado events than I have.",

The 7.8 had enough energy to power NYC for 4 days. So an earthqake of 4.8 would only power NYC for about 6 minutes.\n\nWhile the energy reduces by the factor 10 per 1point on the richter scale, the number of quakes of that strength funnely enoigh also follow a logarithmic scale (for example ~10 of strength 7, 100 of strength 6, 1000 of strength 5 and so on)\n\nIf we now assume we could harvest 100% of the energy released by an earthqake and we did this for every single one worldwide (be it in Turkey, the US or somewhere in the mariana trench), with the resulting energy we could power NYC for aproximately 8 months. (Excludimg quakes of strength &gt; 9 since they are to rare and they'd probably destroy any machine that tried harvesting tjem anyways)\n\nThis next part is the math: 4  days for a 7.8 gices us 2 days for the average 7.x (4days* 10^7.5 / 10^7.8). There are 10-20  quakes of 7.x per year. Going the average number gives us 30 days of energy for NYC from quakes of strength 7.x. Now we have 8 categories (1.x; 2.x; 3.x ...) energy and amount both follow a logarthmic scale. One increasing the other decreasing. Meaning to get the total energy we can just multiply the energy we got for 1 category by the number of categories. 8*1 month = 8 months.\n\nThis is already really not worth the effort. And that is before taking into account, that getting anywhere near 100% efficency is quite impossible - and most earthquakes happen in areas that make it really impractical to harvest their energy - also at some point the quakes would be so strong that they'd just destroy whatever is used to harvest them.\n\nSo yes, neat idea, but physics and maths says no",

Areas where the crust is thinner or the mantle can rise into the crust create temperature differences that can be harnessed for energy production.\n\nWhat is being talked about here is the harvesting of the *potential* energy stores within the plates along fault lines which is then released as *kinetic* energy during an earthquake.  \n\nThis could probably be done using the same tech that we use in the foundation of buildings but instead of dampening vibrations to the building we use the movement of the lower foundational section to move coils around a magnet housed in the upper section.  The issue is earthquakes are unpredictable so it just isnt feasible.",

The biggest examples are rivers that change course; as long as it's natural (e.g. no dam) then any border on the river will shift with the river. Borders would shift with earthquakes.\n\nAlso, regarding Lat Lon, physical markers on the ground are more important than coordinates and agreements on paper. E.g. most of the US Canada border is defined as a straight line on paper, but in the real world, there is a series of border markers that form more of a zigzag. The zigzag connect-the-dots-between-the-markers boundary is more enforceable than the line on a map.\n\nIf that Belgian-Dutch town (Baarle Hertog and Baarle Nassau) suffered an earthquake, realistically the border tiles on the pavement would determine the new border. Luckily, the town is full of border markers on the ground.",

The course of a river can however can change over time, both by nature and by human intervention. For a long time no one few cared about how that affects the border, because both Croatia and Serbia where part of the same country, Yugoslavia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia however, both Croatia and Serbia became their own sovereign countries. Now Croatia claims that the border follows the current course of the Danube, while Serbia claims it follows the former course.\n\nThis of course leads to some pockets of land being claimed by both countries. More interestingly there are a few areas that are claimed by neither country. Thus some Czech politician/activist claimed the land for himself and used it to found Liberland.",

            "comment": "I had a brain tumor removed three years ago. It was right on my left frontal lobe, so they were able to just take a big flap of my forehead skin and create a window into my brain to take it out, much like this video. There was a slight chance that I could lose my speech temporarily but luckily I did not. However, the first 12 hours after the operation in the ICU were the most painful of my life. Some of the higher grade malignant tumors like glioblastoma can branch out into your brain more like the roots of a tree, making them not so easy to remove completely. I had a lower grade of this, but still nasty, so I go in for an MRI scan every three months to make sure nothing is going on in there. We'll see.",

I thought it was an infection of sorts, so I went to an Urgicare to get looked at. Turned out it was Mono, but the NP recommended I get a CT scan to see if my tonsils were swollen. During that someone was on the ball and looked up at my head. Lo and behold there was a mass right there in my cerebellum. Thats the part of your brain that controls coordination and movement, so it came as a shock to me because I was so fit and active. You really can't know these things unless you're checked for it.",

Most of the data collected by the Nazis was also of little scientific value, and many of the experiments could have been performed without loss of life. There are exceptions, but the majority were performed to satisfy Nazi sadism. It is also of note that the Nazis had very stringent protections against animal experimentation. There's a reason most Nazi doctors were prosecuted instead of protected, the way Unit 731 was. And even then there were experiments Unit 731 performed that could have used non-human analogues.\n",

It was extremely stressful job running a store and I got no support from the owner, leading up to constant pain and taking maximum doses of pain killer every day just to get by. After about 3 weeks on pain killers I decided to leave the job and get out of a bad situation. The day I put in my notice to leave and the two weeks until I left I had no pain, and the pain hasn't come back since which was about 3 months ago.\n\nI'm not sure if it has been there for years and is just now showing due to the stress, or what caused it. The doctors said it looks and acts similar to a tumor that appears in children from 5-10, most of which don't live long after. The only way to check is the biopsy I commented about originally, but that risks me losing part of my vision and wouldn't get rid of it completely. I just got through my first 90 days at my new job and actually have health insurance, something my previous job never offered, so we will see how everything is and decide what to do to fix it.",

Only 1/3 of patients lived longer than 3 months.  \n\nThen cyclosporine was discovered in the 70s, and entered widespread usage in 1983s.  For those who dont know cyclosporine is a very powerful immune suppressing drug that drastically increases the changes a transplant will take. \n\nAfter that the first successful pediatric transplant was done in 1984 on a 4 year old boy.  \n\nToday, just 34 years after the first successful pediatric transplant, 3500 heart transplants are performed a year.  On top of that one thing that may professionals believe is possible is that in the future we can make artifical organs and wont need human donors anymore. This means everyone who needs a transplant will receive one.  \n\nIt's things like brain surgery, heart surgery, transplantation, and future possibilities that make me hope reincarnation is a real thing.  I would love to see where the world is in 100-200 years. ",

A wellknown chinese doctor was ordered to help the warlord Cao Cao because he had a brain tumor torturing him for years. The doctor wanted to do a surgery as the only hope. At first Cao Cao allowed it but just before the surgery Cao Cao decided that the doctor was an assassin and had him imprisoned. Some time after Cao Cao died.         \n        \nSurgeries are known to doctors across middle eastern and east asia for thousands of years. They became more precise over history",

I don't know what the procedure was, but he has a scar on the side of his head and has a tube that goes from his head to his brain for drainage or something. \n\nHe was always so sick as a kid. He had to lay down a lot and couldn't stand loud noises. At school he would mostly be in the teachers lounge with support and he would lay down until my mom came to get him almost every day. Yet he hardly ever complained about anything.\n\nAnd he was always picked on because of his head size (side with the tumor was noticably bigger). He's very quiet and antisocia because of his childhood. I love him and I wish I understood what he was going through when I was a kid so I could help him back then, but our relationship has been closer once I realized it.\n\n\nEdit: Hi guys, thanks for all of the comments! Unfortunately I'm starting to get a little depressed when I come back to this thinking about his childhood. Going to turn off notifications, but seriously thank you guys for the support",

Literally in the span of a sentence she'd go from normal to raging volcano, flying off the handle. When they discovered the tumor the doctors said it was squeezing the part of her brain that controls those kinds of outbursts. It's been years since the surgery and she's gotten a lot better, but I think she still has patience problems. Not sure if that's because of the tumor or if that's just who she is as a person. \n\nShe recently got a big promotion at her job and will be moving to California to the corporate office! ",

Tumor removal through the nose isn't all that interesting to observe until the startlingly massive chunks starts being pulled back out through the nostrils. It's all camera views on a monitor. Through the skull is bizarre. Let's just cut a little window through the bone, ok now set this skull chunk aside, we're gonna want to put that back. Ooh look! We're in! Nurse, melon baller, please. I need to scoop out this tumor. \n\nNow getting to watch an aortic valve replacement with porcine valve... That was a bit more messy. Plowing the hand-mixer looking saw through the sternum and then seeing just how much the ribs flex? Holy shit. Also, watching the handover to the heart lung machine when they stop the heart is freaky. You see it sitting there thumping away, then suddenly, it just breaks rhythm and is motionless. ",

The surgery is far less invasive than what is shown in the first part of the gif, what my surgeon called \"lifting the hood.\" Recovery for endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery is pretty reasonable too; 3 days in the hospital and a few weeks at home care.\n\nThe only thing I'd add here as to avoid confusion is that surgery through the nose doesn't always go into the brain itself. Pituitary tumors are fairly common and actually sit below the brain in the sella right between where your optic nerves cross. ",

The bottom of the bubble is right on the nasal cavity, the top is just below the pituitary gland (which is where the tumor is). So we break through the front / bottom of the bubble, then the back/top of the bubble and we have access to the brain tissue - after breaking through the dura mater. ",

Each one poses a unique challenge to the surgeon. Some tumors sit on the surface of the brain, easily identifiable. Others are deep inside and require creation of a safe passage through normal brain tissue to get at the tumor. Some tumors are soft and suck up our suction tubing like grape jelly. Other tumors are hard as rocks, requiring powerful ultrasound tools to essentially vaporize the tumor bit by bit. Some tumors are clearly distinct from brain tissue while others look identical to normal brain, and must be distinguished based on how the tissue feels through our instruments. Some tumors basically fall out of the head as soon as you free them, others are sticky and will wrap themselves around blood vessels and nerves requiring hours of tedious work to free them. The basic steps shown in these gifs can be learned within a neurosurgical residency, but learning the technical nuances of getting these things out of the brain takes many years beyond that.",

Some tumors do smell quite different when cauterized compared to brain, but in my experience, they are also tumors that look different as well, so it doesn\u2019t add much useful information for me. The most important tool for me in distinguishing tumor vs brain is my sucker. As you know, it has a small hole on the grip that when covered makes the suction stronger. For many surgeons, covering and uncovering the hole is a binary technique. Many neurosurgeons, however, hold the sucker in such a way that they can roll their thumb over the hole and get a gradient of suction strength. I know how much suction it takes to suck up normal white matter and gray matter. When testing something I think could be tumor, I compare the suction required to evacuate the tissue to what normal brain should feel like. I guess some neurosurgeons use their noses. I use my left thumb. \n\nBest of luck in the match!!! Do yourself a favor and spend as much time as you can with the people you care about before residency starts. ",

I kid you not we've dropped so much heavy shit on our floor and it all just bounces off unscathed.  One more fun fact for the three of you that read this.  Soft joints at all corners and edges.  Meaning silicone, not grout.  Buildings expand and contract and tiling right up to walls and edges mean that when the building expands and contracts it will crack your tile.  A silicone joint allows for enough flex that you won't ever see a cracked tile in your life.\n\nEdit: I'm mostly talking about wall tile, at floors you can just leave at least an 1/8\" from the walls and let your base cover it, no need to silicone.\n\nEdit 2: Look up the TCNA guidelines (Tile Council of North America).  They have all the info you'll ever need for installing tile the right way.  Floors do require soft joints, but only when they get so big or have funky shapes.",

The entire joint against a wall should be silicone.  Any grout manufacturer will have a corresponding silicone that matches their grout colors.  Other than the shine inherent to silicone it's practically indistinguishable from the grout.  Laticrete products  is what we used.\n\n\nEdit: I probably shouldn't have said corners.  I meant edges really.",

That was a million percent false.  Spend extra time making sure all your edge cuts are pristine.  For reference a minimum 1/8\" gap is what you should shoot for at the inside corners and edges.",

They scrape the floor nice and clean and smooth by getting under the tile and scraping horizontally instead of chipping away downward.  I've seen SDS attachments that work the same way (somewhat flexible spatula type thing) which I would recommend at a minimum.   \n\nThe floor scraper thing is really nice though because it's much more powerful and it has wheels so you're not crawling around bent over on your knees all day.  I don't know how old you are but just the thought of having to do that is making my back hurt.  Totally worth the $50 or whatever to rent one for a few hours to me.",

If you apply a flat coat to the floor, any low spot in the floor would be reflected in the mortar and you might not end up making good adhesion there.  The grooves mean you will always be smooshing the tile down into the mortar bed.  Combined with the wiggle, this gives you the best chance of having solid adhesion across the whole tile with no gaps.  The mortar can change thickness as needed to fill the space.",

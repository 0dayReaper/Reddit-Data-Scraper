One of the first things she did as a therapist was do group therapy for kids from Moore who had to ride out the tornado *at school*, or lost friends, family, or their homes as a result. \n\nI still remember the previous EF5 that went through that town. That was the worst tornado on record until the Joplin EF5. For one town to have been hit *twice* by two of the strongest tornados ever recorded is nuts. Realistically, there's large swaths of land south of OKC with quite low population density and very small towns. So for those two tornados to have leveled miles of the same town within a decade or so (not including smaller ones, just counting these record setting/breaking ones), it just seems like a town to avoid living in. \n\nMy family up in Tulsa installed a steel tornado shelter after the first one leveled and area *a mile wide* and *several miles long*, because stone and 2x4s moving at 2-300mph are absolutely deadly, and will go right through our shitty American toothpick 2x4 framed houses, regardless of outer brick walls.",

Big box stores are built differently than houses which can mean different safety rules for sheltering (for example, in a home with no basement you are told to go to the inner most part of the house, but the center of a big box store is a no go). As I mentioned in my first post anything can happen, but you have to pick somewhere to go. Tornados move in every direction but they certainly trend to move in the north-east direction.",

I know in Boone Count, KY, where I live, there aren't any. But apparently the county has arrangements with businesses, churches, and homeless shelters. \n\nIn most of these areas, the homeless will be connected to some kind of shelter since living without them is almost impossible (you'd freeze to death for a good part of the year). That would be their main storm shelter as well: the homeless shelter that they sleep in. Any open business is probably required by law to provide shelter during an emergency as well. \n\n&gt;and god forbid we put community storm shelters on google or anything.\n\nSorry, I'm old and sometimes forget that google maps exist, lol. My problem was that I was thinking what I would do as a visitor, and I would never google a storm shelter while travelling. I'd shelter in place at the hotel I'm staying at, or shelter in place at whatever place I'm visiting. \n\nAnd I just wouldn't be in the middle of nowhere during a big storm. I'd check the weather ahead of time and if there would be storms I'd stay near areas where I knew there were shopping centers or grocery stores. Even at home, we once got caught out and sheltered in the walk-in fridge at a Kroger's. \n\nI would never think of googling an actual storm shelter. I guess at this point I assumed they basically didn't exist. I mentioned the idea of finding a storm shelter while travelling, and my wife also thought that was bizarre. We're just used to living in an area that has tornados, and sheltering in place makes sense.\n\nEdit: Oh, and I was also talking about actually finding the place. Google maps will get me to the area, but exactly where is the entrance, where do I park, is it even open, etc. This all sounds more complicated and dangerous than simply sheltering in place.",

People will shelter in their home or a neighbors home even if the don't have a basement. \n\n2. People will drive to a community shelter during an active tornado only to find it locked and have to survive the storm outside or in their car.\n\nSo we closed the shelters, diverted the money to weather alert radios for residents that need them, and put out messaging abouy making a plan before the tornado strikes.\n\nEdit: Our shelter were not dedicated storm shelters. They were churchs, schools, and business who has rated safe spaces built into them. If someone show up while the place is open, they will invite them in. Buy many of our storm happen after those places would close for the day.",

With the seasons changing from cold -&gt; warm in the spring the temperature changes occur more rapidly at the surface than higher in the atmosphere which means you setup the temperature instability needed for strong storms.   In fall we are going from warm -&gt; cold so it's generally the opposite with the colder air at the surface.",

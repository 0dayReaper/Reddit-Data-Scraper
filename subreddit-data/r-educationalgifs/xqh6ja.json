The wind?  A tornado!  They're angry!  It's very easy to see where religion got its start.",

Take a photo of the horizon looking east, and from that same spot make one sunrise sighting on either the spring or fall equinox. Mark where the sun came up on the photo, and then measure an angle half of your latitude to the left and right of there against the real horizon, and mark those points on the photo. Those are where sunrise will be on the summer and winter solstices. \n\nThe trickier part is all the days in between. Notice in the animation the sun moves faster when it's in the middle and slows down when it's near the ends. To figure where it will be on a given date you have to use trigonometry.",

The \"evening\" sun would set practically due North of you for just a second at midnight and then rise again. All day the sun travels around the sky near the horizon until it's at its highest at noon, due South just above the horizon.\n\n If you were to place yourself further south of that point, the sun would set slightly more west of North and then rise slightly more east of North after a few minutes or hours depending how far south you went. If you place yourself in New York, the sun will set somewhat in the northwest and rise somewhat in the northeast about 9 hours later.\n\nBeing north of the tropic line just means at no point in the year will the sun be directly overhead at noon, instead it'll always be somewhat south of overhead.",

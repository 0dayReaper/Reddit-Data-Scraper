My clit was partially torn and lost function for a while, but is mostly okay again 3 years out. It wasn't a total tear in a straight line upwards from vag to clit, but everything stretched so much that the shortest connecting tissue - the hood and some labial tissue- failed under the strain.",

There was nothing really to be done though. Also, my kid had a record-breaking head, so that's also a statistical anomaly. \n\nI'll give you the TMI - the hood is definitely still gone, so things are way more \"exposed\" and for a while they were super overstimulated and painful, rubbing on undergarments, and I basically lost my ability to orgasm. I was afraid the ability was gone for good and definitely grieved that. At around 8 months postpartum, sensation started returning with lightening shocks at first, then gradually improved. Now, 3 years later, I'm back to \"normal\" sexually, though the hood tissue is still gone and things will occasionally rub it the wrong way.",

I unfortunately retained pieces of my placenta after delivering the bulk of it with the guidance of my midwife. They had to manually (read: with their hands)  reach inside to scoop out placental remains, sans epidural. The first midwife\u2019s hands were too large with my swelling so they found another doctor to assist - Dr. Payne. \n\nSo after delivering my massive headed child with a minor para-urethral tear that was further exacerbated after being stitched (also no numbing - I was told there could be two pokes or if I wanted local anesthetic, three pokes)  by three separate manual placenta extractions, I had lost 2 liters of blood, and was so swollen \u201cdown there\u201d that I needed a catheter. But the physical trauma had caused a hematoma in my urethra, which they had to push through forcefully in multiple attempts. \n\nBecause of my blood loss, I required transfusions. My husband at this point was sleeping on a couch in the room (approximately 4:30 am) and they required one able bodied adult to be awake to keep your infant in the room with you, so my son was moved to the nursery. My transfusions and final move into the recovery room had me settled around 5:30 am. My son was brought back from the nursery at 6:00 am. \n\nThey don\u2019t warn you that they\u2019ll come by every two to three hours post-delivery to mess with your IVs, check your catheter, and shove on your stomach and uterus to see if they can get any extra blood, fluids, or \u201cdebris\u201d to flush out. \n\nConsider yourself warned!",

After birth and the cutting of the cord, the body starts to sever those blood vessels so that the placenta can detach and be expelled. At the same time the uterus is contracting which acts as like a tourniquet to control the bleeding. So the massaging IS helpful but tugging on the cord is NOT. You want to encourage the contractions of the uterus, not prematurely sever those blood vessel connections. Otherwise you risk mom bleeding out. (Source: I am an RN *disclaimer* but not a labour and delivery RN so I remember basically what\u2019s going on but I\u2019m no expert.)",

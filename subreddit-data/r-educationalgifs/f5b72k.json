A metal to metal seal which fails needs a more expensive fix, if not a whole replacement. In my case, the valve isn't even made in the size I need it anymore. A replacement would require me cutting and soldering a copper pipe spacer onto a shorter valve. Repairability is important.",

However you don\u2019t want to forget about that once winter comes or you will get leaks and freezes, possibly bursts.",

(Rotating spherical element with a perforation for flow through. More abrupt flow cut off, not as good regulation. But it is a sturdy valve type that is resistant to being clogged or impaired)\n\nOther types are gate valves, butterfly valve, needle valve, and many more.\n\nChances are most valves you see are ball valves unless used to regulate flow, which would tend to be globe valves like this.",

Can be also used in any system that has piping running multiple processes (especially batch plants).\n\nDrawbacks are weight, cost, and fluid hammer.",

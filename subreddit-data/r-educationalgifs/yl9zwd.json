If it feels really awkward, try tying that first knot the other way around so the bow part comes more naturally to your hands. \n\nIt sort of works for two-bunny-ears people too, again just be sure you're holding the understrand ear and pulling the other one up and over it. \n\nThe reason is, you'll effectively be making a square knot, but with loops. \n\nJust as with the posted method, you can go back and pinch-and-twist that tail, right up under/inside the knot, if the backside doesn't look good. It will make the knot fatter and a bit less square, it's a trade-off. \n\nSource: used to wrap gifts for my job. \n\nSo if you're wrapping a present, you can cut off another length of ribbon, spin your gift 180\u00b0, slide the new piece under the knot vertically, make your bunny ear from the lower bit, and tie another bow (no knot, just the bow) that will come out opposite the first. Tweak and/or cut ends to make all 4 loops and all 4 tails the same length for a fluffy festive bow.",

This allows the plastic to be formed around a \u201ccore\u201d by allowing the core to pass through the head as well.  \n\nThe extruder uses a screw and heat to melt plastic with temperature and pressure.

I would add this looks like tube extrusion where the cross head is extruding a tube over the cable that is then sucked down tight on the cable outside diameter with vacuum. This keeps the wall thickness of the jacket consistent.  There is also pressure extrusion where the jacket is just pushed on by pressure.",

Assuming that internal conduction and heat capacity can keep part of the surface below boiling point, which it almost definitely can for such a brief interval, this setup would actually probably cause a film of moisture to accumulate on the cable. Or at least on the opposite side and edges where the flame is less intense. You can demonstrate this with a torch and a piece of glass.\n\nIt looks like the purpose is to heat set those shiny bands in place. You can see them warping. Which can be done by superheating one side briefly. That\u2019s easier than superheating the cable since the shiny bands are airgapped beneath and very thin rather than in intimate contact with a large heat reservoir.",

Glass has a very thin layer of water that is very tightly bound and will only come off at very high temperatures.  \nWhen doing chemical reactions that are extremely sensitive to water, we dry the glass by torching it, because even the surface bound water can cause problems. If the water you see when torching glass was being deposited by the combustion of butane, then we wouldn't use that unique to dry glassware. (Source: PhD in chemistry)",

But the water vapor will be very hot, and the heat from the flame would almost certainly be enough to heat the surface to a like that the vapor wouldn't condense onto it.  \nIf you had a flame in a perfectly water-free environment, killed the flame, and cooled the walls of the container, then the water would condense on the walls. But in this scenario (especially since there's already going to be water vapor naturally in the air), you would not be wetting a surface by applying a flame to it.",

Not ideal when you have thousands of literal life-saving cables going out every month. A fresh building that can afford the space (another issue with newer equipment) and the time to work everything out, sure go for it. But when you can literally manufacture parts that break because you've done it enough times...",

Also the cable \"jacket\" is like 30cm thick. It's extremely thick, and then it has more insulation inside with aluminium, and then more plastic and then the copper/aluminium cable.\n\nIn general mid and high power cables that run underground or through cities are extremely insulated and definetly not just this plastic film.\n\nI will actually copy And paste this as a OP comment because this definetly shouldn't be in this sub because it's false.",

Clear cut options like this aren't even brought up to that level because the solution is clear. You deal with issues where there is a tradeoff to be made (such as in a substation where compatible metal connector costs start to outweigh the cable cost difference).  \n\n\nAlso, to get back to the main topic:  \nThis could also be the outermost power winding of a trans continental fiber cable. In which case it would also be insulated with several more layers after this. It would be responsible for supplying power to the signal boosters placed at strategic lengths within the core of the cable. Hard to tell without seeing more of the process.",

Well my dad is a Production Manager.\n\nIt's nothing like that, it's way more complicated from the production of the cable itself to the actual plastic jacket. Also the cable \"jacket\" is like 30cm thick. It's extremely thick, and then it has more insulation inside with aluminium, and then more plastic and then the copper/aluminium cable.\n\nIn general mid and high power cables that run underground or through cities are extremely insulated and definetly not just this plastic film.",

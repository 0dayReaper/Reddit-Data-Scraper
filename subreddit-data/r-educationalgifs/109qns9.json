The really dry, papery bit of outer skin/peel at the end won't work, neither will the root bit. The middle part will though, even though it also has the skin/peel on it.\n\n...I have no idea what I'm doing. All I know is that Adam Savage told me it wasn't just fucking around as long as I wrote the results down.\n\nEDIT: Oh, the shallot is because there's no water left in those bits!

This type of circle jig can work well, and safely, except the person in the video rotated the circle in the same direction the blade is spinning. That can cause the workpiece to lift with the upward rotation, climb the teeth of the blade, and pull your hand into the blade, which is exactly what happened here. Turning the circle against and into the downward rotation of the blade keeps the workpiece pressed against the table. It is also safest to turn the circle from the point closest to yourself and furthest from the blade.\n\nEdit: Upon closer inspection, the workpiece didn't lift/climb the teeth in this case, but it did bind against the blade, which is why it whipped around so fast and his hand got pulled toward the blade so quickly.",

My inference/opinion is that he saw an opportunity to leverage the messed up liability system in the US and believed that by \u201cinventing\u201d a safety system (no matter how flawed) he could force all table saw manufacturers into exorbitant licensing deals. \n\nHe appears to have manipulated the patent system into giving him an overly broad patent on the system which is why Bosch\u2019s superior safety system can\u2019t be imported to the US. \n\nHe was reportedly exceptionally difficult to work with, which along with the exorbitant terms, led to all manufacturers refusing to cut a deal for his system. As a result he then tried to get the federal government to mandate saw safety systems (which with his overly broad patent would mean only his inferior system would be allowed.)\n\nWhen all that failed, he became an \u201cexpert witness\u201d for ambulance chasers suing saw manufacturers. In one car I heard about a guy took all the guards, including the fence, off a saw and was \u201cfree handing\u201d cut on strips of floor boards, and, unsurprisingly injured his fingers. So of course he sued the manufacturer of the saw he misused. In some courts the SawStop lawyer/\u201cinventor\u201d was kicked out by the judge and not allowed as an expert but I don\u2019t know any details of why.",

However, the counter argument that the big manufacturers of saws used was \u201ca safety feature cannot be a safety feature if the person has to be put in danger to activate it\u201d or some other BS like that. In reality, if that patent had gone through and Saw Stop had been required, most large producers would have lost money having to reconfigure their saws to include Saw Stop (or something similar). In the end, John was really upset (for obvious reasons).\n\nCorporations cared more about their bottom line than actually protecting customers.",

Yeah, there are all kinds of reasons to take it off, and they\u2019re all based on perceived convenience or lack of risk. Don\u2019t be dumb and make excuses.\n2. Anytime you get close to the blade like that, regardless of whether a guard is installed, push sticks should be used. There is just way too much potential for that blade to pull the object you\u2019re cutting, and your hand, toward the blade.\n3. Use the right tool for the job. Better tools are readily available to make circular cuts like this and I assure you they cost less than getting your hand stitched back up. \n4. Wear the right protective gear, but dang it, long sleeves/hair/dangling things live to get pulled into rotating blades, and you\u2019ll go in along with them. \n\nSo why do I know this? Because I disregarded each rule above and learned the hard way. About 7 years back my hand was pulled into an unguarded rotating table saw blade because I lost respect for the tool and the risk it presented, got my right hand too close to the blade without a push stick, and the glove I was wearing snagged and pulled me in. I was EXTREMELY lucky - I had just turned the saw off and the blade was coasting to a stop. But it still cut the top of my index finger down to the bone (which really isn\u2019t that far, but still, witnessing your own bone being visible through a giant slice in your skin is something that stays with you for a while) from the 2nd knuckle to the tip and nicked a tendon along the way. The ER team did a great job of cleaning it out and stitching me back up, and 8 months of physical therapy with a local hand specialist got me back 90%+ of my pre-accident strength and dexterity.  But those 8 months minus the full use of my dominant hand were among the most humbling in my life. \n\nDo I still use that table saw? Absolutely! It wasn\u2019t the saw\u2019s fault, it was 100% mine and I\u2019ve long since come to terms with that. I have no fear of that saw, but you better believe I respect it more now.",

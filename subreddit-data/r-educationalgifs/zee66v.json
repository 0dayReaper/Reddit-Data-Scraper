I'm all for different ways to look at it though, whatever helps people. All that matters is the answer.\n\nBut in my head, it's easier to change the numbers to something easy to multiply, then consider the difference.\n\nI don't know 14x23 off the top of my head, but I know 15x20 is 300, so 15x23 must be 345, then I just subtract 1x23 to arrive at 322. Certainly not a method I'd use to teach multiplication to someone... But it works well enough for me.",

As such, there have been a lot of different ways taught to do them. Which is one of the things that pissed so many people off about common core. They saw different ways to do arithmetic than they were taught and said things like, \"They're changing math,\" and, \"Why don't you just do it the *right* way?\" The same confused screaming was heard back when New Math was introduced in the 1950s.",

Interpret products of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 5 \u00d7 7 as the total number of objects in 5 groups of 7 objects each.\nFor example, describe a context in which a total number of objects can be expressed as 5 \u00d7 7.\n\n2. Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 56 \u00f7 8 as the number of objects in each share when 56\nobjects are partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when 56 objects are partitioned into equal shares of 8\nobjects each. For example, describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be expressed as 56\u00f78.\n\n3. Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1\n\n4. Determine the unknown whole number in a multiplication or division equation relating three whole numbers. For example,\ndetermine the unknown number that makes the equation true in each of the equations 8 \u00d7 ? = 48, 5 = \uf0a8 \u00f7 3, 6 \u00d7 6 = ?.\n\n**Understand properties of multiplication and the relationship between multiplication and division.**\n\n5. Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide.2 Examples: If 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 is known, then 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 is\nalso known. (Commutative property of multiplication.) 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2 can be found by 3 \u00d7 5 = 15, then 15 \u00d7 2 = 30, or\nby 5 \u00d7 2 = 10, then 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. (Associative property of multiplication.) Knowing that 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 and 8 \u00d7 2 = 16,\none can find 8 \u00d7 7 as 8 \u00d7 (5 + 2) = (8 \u00d7 5) + (8 \u00d7 2) = 40 + 16 = 56. (Distributive property.)\n\n6. Understand division as an unknown-factor problem. For example, find 32 \u00f7 8 by finding the number that makes 32 when\nmultiplied by 8.\n\n\n----\n\nIf you were basically raised in an area that taught math appropriately basically ever, you basically got common core. The goal between common core is to not let certain states \"fudge\" standards - so that every state has \"common/consistent (core/fundamental) standards\" in the whole country - so you don't get 8th graders doing 4th grade level stuff and so fourth. \n\n\n----\n\nIn the 1990s, a movement began in the U.S. to establish national educational standards for students across the country.\n\n(a) outlining what students were expected to know and do at each grade level\n\n(b) implementing ways to find out if they were meeting those standards.[2]\n\n\nThat's it. All it is basically making sure every state is keeping up with teaching basically what your textbook probably already has in it you if you come from a minimally academically competent school/state.",

There's a different problem going in there.\n\n(In fact, the Common Core includes a section on Mathematical Practices, one of which is explicitly to look for and make use of structure to solve problems. It does not say \"use the same structure to solve all problems, even when it's inefficient\").\n\nSource: Math teacher who has taught 6, 7, 8th grade math as well as high school Algebra and Geometry over the past 9 years.",

The average person would have way more trouble learning basic arithmetic for a limited amount of application - are you expecting them to have learned their tables beyond 12x12? What if they have to multiply a 3-digit number or two large 2-digit numbers to find the cost of an order? \n\nThe pictograph method is much simpler to understand (by counting and just the carry-over rule), less prone to mistakes, verifiable, and scalable enough for the times.\n\nEdit - just looked it up and it looks like this method comes from a book published by an Indian Hindu monk in the 60s claiming to have derived the methods from the Vedas themselves - but more than likely just made em up lmao so I guess this thread is moot",

If you know your times tables (e.g. set 1 on the right is 7x7, and I know that's 49), then you can count ends instead of intersections, and multiply accordingly, then answer. And then you can check your own work.\n\nAs a method of *teaching multiplication*, it works just fine. As a method of slowing down and checking your work, it's also a great way to go.\n\nIt's not a way for people with college degrees to replace the way they do arithmetic. But for teaching kids who don't know how to do arithmetic at all (i.e. the purpose it was meant for), it works just fine.",

                            "comment": "All of our math is based on how many fingers we have. So since we have 10 fingers, no matter how many \"units\" of something you have, you'll always loop back to a new \"10th\" after you get to 10. Another way to look at is when you only use 1 hand to count to 5 and then use the other hand to count every time you hit 5 and reset the other hand, like a tally mark going diagonally to signify \"new batch\"\n\nSO, when you say the number \"13\", you're really saying 10 units in the first batch, PLUS 3 in a new batch of 10max, same exact way an abacus works.\n\nI'll use a different example to make the numbers easier than OP you replied to: 13 x 20, which can be written as, \"13 happening 20 times\". But what you can do is take that 13 and make it into (10 + 3), since 13 is really just 1 unit of 10, and 3 units of 1.\n\nBut I think you're having more trouble visualizing what is happening, so here's a literal visualization of what just happened.\n\n13 x 20 means 13 is happening 20 times, or in other words:\n\n13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 = 260\n\nOr since 13 can be made easier to multiply by breaking it down into its smaller parts, being 10 + 3, you can do the math easeir by doing 10 x 20, which is 200. And then 3 x 20, which is 60, so 200 + 60 = 260\n\nOR\n\n( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 ) = 200\n\n\\+\n\n( 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 ) = 60\n\nMultiplication is just Addition happening a certain amounts of times. You could absolutely write the number \"three\" 20 times if you want, but then you have to count how many times you  wrote the number 3, which just ends up recreating the concept of multiplication.\n\nAll of these mean the same thing:\n\n13 x 20 = 260\n\n(10 x 20) + (3 x 20) = 260\n\n(10 + 3 ) x 20 = 260\n\n20(10+3)  = 260\n\n10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 260",

I\u2019m not saying traditional multiplication is the best way, but it\u2019s the best starting point to me, and it\u2019s definitely better than this bullshit. There are much better methods to do faster and easier multiplication than this. The principles of this method, which when I learned it was called FOIL, is fantastic for mental math, but emphasizing the drawing of the lines is so dumb. It teaches them to be dependent on the visuals instead of understanding the math behind it.",

There's no right way as long as the answer is correct.\n\nSo long as it's internally consistent and useful, it's mathematically sound.",

I\u2019ve seen younger relatives and family friends struggle because they were taught this multiplication method and some other weird one, while not being taught traditional multiplication at all in school. That is what I strongly don\u2019t agree with, as their ability to multiply numbers is handicapped by the consequences of having to draw everything out. Both this and this weird Diamond method they were taught break down with larger numbers. They also struggled with long division cause they have to do long-winded stuff like this in the middle.\n\nTo give it credit, I think that this is a wonderful visual teaching tool and can lead to improvements of multiplication habits once you\u2019re able to see the underlying principles.",

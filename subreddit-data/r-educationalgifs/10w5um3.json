This includes using data on settlement patterns, food production, and migration, as well as records of wars, plagues, and other events that may have impacted the population. The estimates are then cross-referenced with historical records and archaeological data to arrive at a rough estimate of the population at a given time.",

The fact of the matter is that it would have been logistically impossible for settlers to kill the 70 million+ natives who died to disease. Are you saying that if their conditions had been better that smallpox would have somehow spared them? \n\n90% of the native population had died by 1600, well before major expansion west had started.",

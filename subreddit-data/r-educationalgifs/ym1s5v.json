Tho arguably calculus does play a factor in how fx plugins work, especially in modern daws where you have formula controllers that utilize calculus or algebraic equations to do complex automations on different fx to create experimental and interesting outcomes for sound design, but you find that being utilized a lot more in genres like edm and even then, only by more mathematically inclined artists, you can create masterpieces without ever thinking of the math behind it, I love the idea that folks utlize mathematical relationships to create sound in a unique way",

You have to do a forward Fourier transform to figure it out though. \n\n\nSine and cosine are the same waveform 90 degrees phase shifted. And sound can be expressed as a sum of sine and cosine waves at different frequencies",

I imagine low end frequencies that can be felt but not heard would have a strange effect on a person. Standing waves also make things called bass pockets in studios that aren\u2019t treated well enough",

You can derive an analytical solution using d'Alembert's travelling wave solution that follows the superposition principle demonstrated in the 3rd gif.\n\nIn a room with 3 dimensions the same kind of principle applies, except it's a full volume described by the 3D wave equation and boundary conditions. As it's a partial differential equation, you can use some kind of numerical approximation technique to solve for the evolving pressure field (like FDTD). Standing waves become more clearly visible in visualisations after 2nd/3rd order reflections.",

You can use an IFFT to convert these responses from the frequency domain to the time domain. In simple terms if you add the reflected sine waves of several different frequencies together you end up with a map showing you the changes of impedance throughout the transmission line. Very useful for finding faults and defects.",

And what's even cooler is your lungs don't expand because air is coming in them so much as they expand because the diaphragm is increasing the volume in your chest cavity. This causes the lungs to expand, and as they do they create a pressure that is less than the atmospheric pressure outside, causing air in flood into our lungs. \n\nThis is why people can't breathe at the top of mountains or high elevations; the amount of oxygen in that you breathe in is exactly the same, it's just your diaphragm can't exert enough negative pressure compared to the partial pressure of oxygen in the air to fulfill the bodies needs for oxygen. \n\nThank you for coming to my solicited TEDTalk.",

Deep breathing with your belly has shown evidence to enhance autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility. Especially \n\n&gt; Psychological/behavioral outputs related to the abovementioned changes are increased comfort, relaxation, pleasantness, vigor and alertness, and reduced symptoms of arousal, anxiety, depression, anger, and confusion.\n\n[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137615/)",

Your pelvic floor is important as well, so it\u2019s unfortunate to me that this gif cuts off right below the diaphragm.\n\nYour pelvic floor and diaphragm are supposed to work in sync when inhaling and exhaling: when you inhale, your pelvic floor relaxes down and your diaphragm contracts down. This creates a vacuum around the lungs, which pulls air into the lungs. The lungs expand down and out as they fill. Exhaling is the opposite: the pelvic floor contracts up and the diaphragm relaxes up, reducing the space available to the lungs and ending the vacuum.\n\nSo saying \u201cexpand your stomach\u201d isn\u2019t _quite_ on the mark, because breathing isn\u2019t about pushing your stomach in and out to gain \u201cdepth\u201d as much as it is maximizing the vertical range of your diaphragm and pelvic floor to gain \u201clength\u201d(primarily) and horizontal expansion of the ribs to gain \u201cwidth\u201d (secondarily). Kinda like a piston, if that makes sense. Which is also why you\u2019ll sometimes hear yoga/Pilates teachers say to try to breathe through your sides.\n\nWhen I do my exercises, for example, I try to imagine the air passing by my kidneys and reaching into my lower back.",

I\u2019m not too sure if it helps the heart in anyway but given these benefits I can\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t be.",

            "comment": "Bees remarkable communication skills were revealed by Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch in 1946. He discovered that honeybees talk to each other in an unusual code - by \u201cdancing\u201d.\n\nA scout worker bee returns to the colony with information about a rich source of pollen and nectar. Entering the hive she is \u2018checked\u2019 by the guards, who ensure she has the right smell. Inside, she behaves in a strange way, running about, climbing her sisters' backs and vibrating her abdomen to attract the attention of other workers until they gather around pummelling her with their antennae. \n\nThe duration of her waggle indicates the distance to the nectar source. The longer the waggle, the further the flower. And the angle at which she dances across the comb tells them the direction to the flower in relation to the Sun.\n\nHer information are remarkably accurate and can pinpoint the location of a nectar source over six kilometers (3.73 miles) away. Some of her fellow workers set off immediately to find it.\n\n[Image showing the language of bees!](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e75e17_0277c62b226a4d12981775f7a294fdec~mv2.gif)\n\n* [Video Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU_KD1enR3Q)\n* [Text information](https://www.enviroblog.net/post/did-you-know-the-dance-of-the-honey-bee)",

The author, Thomas Seeley, goes into a ton of detail about how the dance works and how they figure it out.\n\nIt's actually way more complicated than just pointing where flowers are.  They use it to find a new location to setup their hive.  Basically when scouts find a suitable location, they go back and dance to indicate its location, and the more intense the dance, the better a candidate they think their location is.  Many scouts are doing this at the same time and basically it works like a debate, with other bees going to examine the sites and begin dancing themselves if they agree.  Eventually the swarm comes to a consensus and in unison they all fly together to the winning site.",

Almost all of the information transmitted through this interaction involves the location of 3 things: the hive, the flower, and the sun. When she's in position and not turning, the \"scout's\" butt will always point towards the sun. The beginning of the wiggle dance represents the location of the hive, and the end represents the location of the flower. Then, she'll shake and start moving - the length of the walk-shake communicates the distance from the hive to the flower - and then double back to let anyone listening to her message get a little additional information from observing the distance she has to travel in that loop back around. Then, the scout just repeats her message to make sure there's no confusion.\n\nThe communication could be summed up as the indication of a first distinct point, then a distinct period of movement in a specific direction, and then another point distinctive from the first one. Any other movement is just necessary to repeat the message.\n\nEdit: whoops i called the scout a he",

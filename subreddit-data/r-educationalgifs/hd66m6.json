Better if you know your allergies and know where the honey comes from (as in if the honey was produced near that allergy source). \n\nA spoonful a day will greatly reduce your allergies but you have to start way in advance of when your allergies act up so you build up a tolerance.\n\nmicro-dosing of allergens is something doctors also do for people to help them with their allergies. So it isn't some essential oil type bs.",

In winter the bees usually keep making a few babies. In early spring with snow and ice, the ceder trees and other odd plants make pollen.\n\nWhat is really going on is the beekeepers steal more honey than they should and after taking the bee's honey, they give sugar and a few pollen patties. The bees really don't like it and would much rather prefer the honey they made or real pollen. \n\nIf the bees are located in places where there is no early spring pollen they need a small amount of this.",

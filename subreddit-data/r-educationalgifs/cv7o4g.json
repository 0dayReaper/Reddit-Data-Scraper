This is about moving an item through an identical item by cutting a hole in it.\n\nIf you aren't able to cut a hole in the things (like walls, doorways) you're moving things through and if those things aren't almost exactly the same size and shape as the item you're moving and you can't just move the object you're moving things through, then I don't see this being helpful.\n\nIt sounds like you're looking more for things in [The Moving Sofa problem.](https://youtu.be/rXfKWIZQIo4)",

You will float.\n\nThe last video I seen posted they said you will sink regardless of if you struggle or not, just faster if you struggle. The guy in it certainly did as well, the relax tips did nothing to stop him sinking. They basically showed him some method of moving to try and escape, but he wasn't strong or fit enough and they had to help him (and struggled).",

I was backpacking in Utah and much of it required hiking through small creeks that were 12-18 inches deep. There were seemingly random patches of quicksand scattered within these creeks, so one second you'll be walking over sand in water and the next you'll sink up to your knee in quicksand.\n\nFortunately, this quicksand was easy enough to get out of as I don't think it was all that deep, but if you tried to go flat you'd drown. Your best bet was to awkwardly turn yourself around, then get yourself to a ~45 degree angle (as much as you can bend where you're still able to stand, and obviously have your head above water.) Now you have the choice of kicking one foot out as far as you can to reach something that isn't quicksand, or to grab onto something like a tree or a friend to pull yourself out. Just never try to go further into quicksand to try to escape and it won't ever be a huge issue.",

Its side length is approximately 6% larger than that of the unit cube through which it passes. The problem of finding the largest square that lies entirely within a unit cube is closely related, and has the same solution.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert%27s_cube",

Because that way, they can't fall down the manhole (among other reasons). \n\nBut a square can - a 2' x 2' square cover would fit over a hole with a 3' diagonal distance, easily falling through. \n\nThis is the same basic concept, but in 3D. Diagonal distances are larger, so as long as you can end up with a funny shape that is more than 1 unit x 1 unit in 2 dimensions, you can make it work.",

Its side length is approximately 6% larger than that of the unit cube through which it passes. The problem of finding the largest square that lies entirely within a unit cube is closely related, and has the same solution.The original proposition posed by Prince Rupert of the Rhine was that a cube could be passed through a hole made in another cube of the same size without splitting the cube into two pieces.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

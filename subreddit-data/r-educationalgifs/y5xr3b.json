The show did a really great job in adapting them, but the show also ended before the last 3 books, the Laconia arc, where the whole story actually comes to fruition.  One of the best series I've ever read.",

Nothing's better than picking up a killer series, finishing it and then seeing it get made for the screen a few years later. Sometimes it's great (the expanse) sometimes it's meh (altered carbon). Either way, what a satisfying sense of superiority. If it's quality you can be that guy like \"oh yeah I read the books a few years ago and I totally thought it'd make a great show in the right hands\". If it sucks you can be like \"man the books were soooo much better \ud83d\ude44\". And it's an earned superiority that no one can argue with even if they think you're a dick \ud83e\udd2d",

If you liked it, you might also like the works of Adrian Tchaikovsky. *Shards of Earth* (2021) is a good starting point for his work and is similar to *The Expanse* in terms of themes and plot, although I personally think *Children of Time* (2015) is his best.",

Absolutely relevant to the current global state of affairs and I could easily see this being adapted for the screen. I've never read anything bad by him, either.\n\nEdit: same kind of vibes as both the expanse and altered carbon too. If you liked those you'll enjoy the owner trilogy.",

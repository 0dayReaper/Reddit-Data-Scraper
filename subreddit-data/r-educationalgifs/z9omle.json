Flavors and smells returned. \n\nIf you\u2019re still smoking and have wanted to quit, most of us in the comments have been there and know exactly what it feels like.   You can do it. But don\u2019t shame yourself if you try once or twice and pick it back up. Do it when you\u2019re ready. \n\nIt is tough at first. But it\u2019s possible.",

I hate hearing the stories of people who \"just stopped one day\", it's not relatable for most people. Quitting is so hard, and it's not a failure just because you smoked again. It's only a failure if you stop trying. Progress can be just doing it a little less each time, gradually reducing the habit until it no longer has control. It's like a freight train going at top speed - that thing doesn't just come to a stop instantly.",

Despite this I tried many times to go cold turkey but I just could not do it. I got myself a little vaporesso swag vape mod 2 months ago and for the first time, it worked for me and I did it. I still had the occasional cigarette for the first few weeks but now I get no cravings at all and the smell and thought of having a cigarette discusts me. I did recently accept a cigarette but it wasn't as satisfying as I remember and tasted like shit. My lungs feel good and I got more energy every day at work.  Best thing I ever did. I'd highly recommend trying a vape pen or mod, though they don't work for everyone as you still need alot of willpower. From there, i can't stress how much easier it is to then quit the vape than it was the cigarettes. Having a few different flavours helps too to keep the vape satisfying",

It got to the point that he just gave them to her and didn't want to be a part of it.\n\nNext was an acupuncture button attached to an ear, which was the hit new thing at the time. I don't recall if it helped; it got infected after a while so she just pulled it out.\n\nNext was a handheld device. For the first little while, you pressed a button every time you picked up a smoke. After a certain point, you smoke only when it beeps. It gets to the point where you're not ready for a smoke, but you power on through it miserably. The goal being to drive you away from smoking.\n\nShe was in the middle of that when my dad died. They were divorced, but the news hit her pretty hard. Completely disrupted her use of the device. She never went back to it.\n\nShe observed that she would smoke more when she saw a coworker grab a smoke. Once she got a private office, she found she wouldn't smoke as often.\n\nI know 2 people who stopped smoking before I met them. One of them is my wife. Their approaches to dealing with it have been interesting.",

Ive tried to quit vaping a few times, the longest I made it was 6 months. Even up until the very day that I cracked 6 months later, it was still just as awful as the second day after quitting. Not many people seem to share my experience. Don't know if I'll ever be able to quit. I also hate the dependency and if it got better after a few months of abstaining I'd quit in a heartbeat. But now I know firsthand that it doesn't so I can't find the willpower.",

So the decision to quit was super easy for me - \"welp, this literally makes me feel *bad* now, so...\"\n\nI had a lot of restless leg, and I got super angry and yelly at people, but I never felt any cravings or discomfort.  Everyone else hated it because of how angry I got, but I was fine with it tbh.",

One joint a day would be enough for most potheads for directly breathing in smoke, and joints often are smaller than cigs. Let alone that any serious pothead uses either a water pipe or a vape these days\n\nCompared to a pack of cigs a day being fairly common\n\nAlso that things like arsenic get into the tobacco plant because they grow it on farms that have soil that is too poor of quality for food crops. Where weed is often hydroponic or at least grown on smaller scales where fresh potting soil is used. Fewer toxins in the soil should make the smoke from the dried plant matter less toxic, no?\n\nThe combustion byproducts are a big issue, but if your plant matter isn't grown in Superfund soil, if it doesn't have any heavy metals in the soil, then the smoke would cause fewer issues, no? On top of being at least 1/10th the volume of smoke\n\nAlso most potheads I know don't smoke *every* day, where cigarette users, it's a shock to see them outside without a cig",

I still get the harsher throat hit or whatever I got from the jul liquid though thats closer to smoking.\n\nI do still have the issue of regulating how much nicotine I get. Especially since the pandemic and I started working from home. I just sit there and hit the vape non stop all day, so i get the lowest nicotine level I can get.",

I didn't care, I loved it AND I wasn't smoking AND my apartment/clothes didn't stink anymore. After that I just naturally vaped less and less, then slowly reduced the nicotine (buy different nic amounts in the same flavor and then combine them in the tank to go slowly between nic levels). Once I got to 0mg I stayed there for maybe 5 months before I just didn't feel like vaping anymore. \n\nGo to a vape shop to help you with a proper setup. You can totally find a way to scratch that itch. Try different levels of PG/VG (personally I liked 50/50), try different wattages, get a mod that allows you to change the wattage, try different tanks with adjustable air flow holes, try different juice companies and different flavors. When I first quit, I used a juice that was super high in nicotine, 18mg, that really gives it a kick. I only used that for the first week or two before mixing it with 12mg to reduce the nicotine level.",

Whenever I had the urge to smoke I'll take a CBD cig instead, and that would control smoking nicotine. It helped me ween off of in about a week, and by the time I knew it I didn't have the urge to smoke a real cigarette. Took a total of 2 weeks or so to stop buying tobacco. The only downside of smoking CBD cigarettes is that it left a bad stench around me with all the smoke hanging around, so I'd walk away from people so it wouldn't disturb them.",

Because eventually someone is going to do some heroin, they\u2019ll feel alright the next morning, probably without even a bit of a hangover and then they\u2019ll get over confident and *thats* how you get heroin addicts.\n\nI get reality is very complicated in almost every aspect but it really is a shame it almost seems like mainstream education doesn\u2019t even attempt to set realistic expectations and warnings",

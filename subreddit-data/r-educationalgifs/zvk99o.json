This is true for all values of a, b and c, in any triangle. Not only that, there are also some combinations of*integers* (whole numbers, not fractions) that work, called Pythagorean Triples. For example: 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 (9+16=25). \n\nHowever, no combination of integers had ever been found as a solution for a^3 + b^3 = c^3, or any other power higher than 2. In other words, there were no known positive integer solutions for a^n + b^n = c^n, so it had long been speculated wether there were any solutions or not. Fermat claimed that he had PROVEN that there were NO positive integer solutions when n is any number greater than 2. This is known as Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. But he famously wrote that the proof \u201ccould not be contained by the margins\u201d or some bs like that. \n\nAnyway, centuries later (in the 1990s I think), Fermat was finally proven correct. But the maths it involved was so complicated and advanced and completely beyond what anyone had even imagined in his day that there was *no way in hell* Fermat actually had a proof for it, at least not one that without any holes in it lol. \n\nNgl tho, \u201cthe proof won\u2019t fit\u201d has got to be the best maths shitpost in history. Like \u201cuhh yeah dude I totally proved it. Source: just trust me bro. No I can\u2019t write it! It\u2019s uhh\u2026 too long. Just trust me bro it\u2019s true \u201c",

The modern proof uses several methods that would not have been available to Fermat as they hadn't been discovered in his lifetime :\n\n\"Wiles's proof uses many techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory, and has many ramifications in these branches of mathematics. It also uses standard constructions of modern algebraic geometry, such as the category of schemes and Iwasawa theory, and other 20th-century techniques which were not available to Fermat. The proof's method of identification of a deformation ring with a Hecke algebra (now referred to as an R=T theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory.\" (Wikipedia - Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Theorem)",

                                    "comment": "You have the classic Pythagorean theorem a^2 + b^2 = c^2 that describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle. There are an infinite number of combinations of a, b, and c that you can plug in that will satisfy the equation. This theorem has been known for thousands of years and has been proved many times using a variety of techniques.\n\nBut what about for exponents greater than two? a^3 + b^3 = c^3, or a^4 + b^4 = c^4, etc.? A mathematician from the 1600s named Pierre de Fermat theorized that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2. This was since referred to as [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem). He claimed to have a proof, but never wrote it out, saying it was too long. No one could figure out whether the theorem was true or not.\n\nThe theorem was proved to be correct, [but it took over 300 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem).\n\nBonus fun fact: the season 10 episode of the Simpsons \"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\" aired a few years after it was proved that Fermat's Last Theorem was true: there were no solutions for the equation given an exponent greater than two.\n\nAt one point, Homer is [standing at a chalkboard with various things written on it](https://i.imgur.com/QJZla2P.png), one of which is the equation 3987^12 + 4365^12 = 4472^12. If this equation is true, it would actually disprove the theorem. It's very very close, but it's not a solution. However, it's so close that many calculators at the time would say that it is in fact a solution, but this is due to rounding errors. This was a bit of a troll by one of the writers, David S. Cohen, who took much delight in seeing posts on message boards at the time by users confused by the fact that Homer seemed to disprove the recently proved Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous math problems in history.\n\nmore reading: https://slate.com/culture/2013/10/the-simpsons-and-fermats-last-theorem-wizard-of-evergreen-terrace-has-brilliant-math-joke-photo.html",

You then measure you A and B and you can square both to get your C squared. The only hard part is then getting your square route to get the length you need to cut the wood/metal.",

Why translate AND rotate when you can just translate, and get the same point across? There are real benefits to reducing the complexity -- peoples' visual centers in their brain suck at processing rotation, compared to translation.\n\nAlso, I assume you meant the part where they resize the triangles, not rotate, since that's the part that really shows it works for any side lengths. If so, that is a fair point. Although I personally think it is obvious that it should work for any right triangle, since they are labeled \"a, b, c\" rather than specific numbers like 3, 4, 5. Either way, the translation-based version could be modified to show the same thing, you'd just have to adjust the side lengths then replay the animation.",

In fact, the only reason the animation works is because they chose a very carefully selected right triangle (the side lengths are in a 3:4:5 ratio which is what allowed them to perfectly break up the a\u00b2 square to fit around the b\u00b2 square).\n\nThe YouTube video that was shared is completely generalizable. It works with any right triangle. In fact, this is what they're showing when they wiggle around the shapes - no matter what right triangle you start with, you could follow exactly the same steps. Because of this, you animation actually provides an actual proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\nNow, the first animation could be good for building intuition, as you said. In fact, playing around with special examples is often how new discoveries occur. But the second video is what you should be eventually aiming for. Trying to show that your discovery can be used in general, therefore making it more useful than just a special example.\n\nGranted, if I was using this with my students, there would be a lot of support. The video doesn't help you understand the proof at all, so I'd have to support them in doing that (for example, showing the video after several days of using the Pythagorean Theorem, pausing at key moments and having them talk with partners about what's on the screen, asking them to write algebraic representations of the geometry, etc).",

The sum of the areas of the little pieces of paper will still be equal to the area of your original larger paper.\n\nThat being said, in this gif, the b2 fit in the c2 shape. The remaining space was L-shaped. Since the value of the area doesn't change even if you cut it up, the gif cut up the a2 shape so that the pieces went inside the L-shape. And it so happens that the cut up pieces of a2 perfectly occupies the remaining L-shape, thereby proving a2+b2=c2.\n\nMaths requires a bit of visualisation. When you see a number squared, it can be considered area of a square with a side of length of the number. That's why it's called a square. When you see a number cubed (raised to the power of 3), it can be considered the volume of a cube with a side of length of the number. It helps to have visual representations of how they work. Unfortunately schools rarely help us with visual cues.",

Things like measuring distance between galaxies or space objects; if you know the size of two sides in a right angle triangle then you\u2019ll automatically know the third.  It\u2019s used to make GPS work since they just use two points, satellite and you, to figure out how far you are from the third point automatically. \n\nEinstein invented his own proof of the theorem while studying for fun at the age of 12. He utilized it heavily in his work on the general theory of relativity. \n\nAlbert Einstein's Metric equation is simply Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem applied to the three spatial co-ordinates and equating them to the displacement of a ray of light.\n\nThe fundamental importance of the theorem is that it is an objective truth. There is hardly anything in the world we can prove, but we *always* know that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and that is a universal truth - no matter what. That\u2019s why triangles, and geometry, was originally seen as supernatural and religious. It\u2019s often synonymous with god because it is \u201cabsolute truth\u201d. Triangles are god. That is why in his time Pythagorean had a religious cult and was hailed as some sort of god or prophet.",

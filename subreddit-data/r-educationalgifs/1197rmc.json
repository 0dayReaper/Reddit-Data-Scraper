These are famous math-shapes. In coordinate terms both of these shapes are between x=-1 and x=1.\n* point A is the centre of the two shapes, coordinate (0,0)\n* main bit to look at is the labelled top right quarter of the figure. we let the point C slide around the \u221e and take 3 other points at its mirror images in the horizontal and vertical axis (not labelled)\n* in bold red on both sides are curved line segments on the \u221e which joins two pairs of these points - the total \"arc\" length of these line segments is the first quantity of interest - call it RED\\_LENGTH\n* point B is calculated from C at each step, by being the point close to C on the \u221e where the square of the distance from A to B (written AB) is equal to the distance from A to C (written AC), and we again take the mirror images of B in the horizontal / vertical axes (not labelled)\n* we take lines out through A and B (and its reflections) out to the edge of the squircle. We take pairs of these lines and measure the area between them as well as the edge of the squircle (the left and right purple triangly shaded bits) - they also throw in the areas at 90 degree angles to these (the top and bottom triangly shaded bits), they all have the same area  - the total purple area is the second quantity of interest, call it PURPLE\\_AREA\n\nfinally - the big reveal is that - RED\\_LENGTH = \u221a2 \\* PURPLE\\_AREA at every point in the gif!\n\nThis is pretty random to me, it's unusual to see a length equated to an area like this. My guess is someone noticed that the total length of the lemniscate was equal to  \u221a2 \\* the area of the squircle (shown at the point where A,B,C are all at the centre) and tried to find a more general pattern. This seems hard to derive even if you know the answer, let alone without!",

At least that's how I understood it, but when I look at this equation, that's definitely **not** the right way to set it up.

The distance along the lemniscate between the points?\n\nIf either of those two options, it implies that AB has an upper limit of 1 since AC is always smaller. Does the \"property\" showed still hold for larger squircles? Or only for \"unit\" squircles?\n\nI guess my point is that as someone who does actually understand every word of whats in the gif and sort of what its getting at, its still really confusing and doesnt actually educate or explain anything.",

It started cause we grew up poor and his older brother and younger sister had beds and as the middle child he was sleeping on the floor. He found it fun cause hes a kid. Then after a few years he can't sleep on beds anymore. He finds beds uncomfortable and can't sleep in one or any place with high elevation. \n\nHe's almost done with highschool now, but on the plus side, when he goes to college he can sleep in the streets and save money on dorms.",

We do heat our whole basement (1500 sq ft) with underfloor electric, with a couple mini ductless mini splits to supplement. We have 6 different zones on their own thermostats so we only heat the areas we use. \n\nWe also have it in our master bath and it means we barely turn on the mini split all winter since the floor heat keeps us toasty. The trick for efficiency is to not have huge jumps in temps \u2014 so have it set to heat up slowly rather than pull the juice to turn from off to 78 degrees right away. Having it stair step over a couple hours definitely keeps the cost lower (my husband got equipment to test the draw and usage and had fun finding our optimal schedule for cost effectiveness).",

Then had an electrician come do the testing and install the thermostat before we thin set over the top for the tile. \n\nMy husband is the hugest fan, as are our pets.

And in the video it shows you can\u2019t place cabinets directly on top of the coils (can get too hot). So either don\u2019t put wire within a couple inches of the cabinet footprint or get raised cabinetry.",

If the large doors are opened in the winter and the warm air escapes, it doesn\u2019t take long for the building to feel warm again when the door closes. With conventional air heating, like my other shop, once the door opens and the warm air rushes out, it takes forever for the building to warm up again. When doing maintenance in the winter on the plane, we have to take it out of the building to do run-up tests. When the door closes again, it still feels warm inside pretty quickly and with the floor being warm, when your on your back underneath something, it isn\u2019t cold.   \n   \nThe only thing with heated floors in a large building is the temperature change takes awhile. When we\u2019ve had a sudden cold spell and the heat wasn\u2019t turned on for the winter yet, it will take 12-48hrs until the building hits the right temp, depending on the temperature gradient.",

Part of their design usually includes a ridiculously long chimney pipe designed to give it lots of time to transfer as much heat as possible before it exits the structure.  \n\nThe first 20-30 feet of the pipe is usually encased in some sort of high mass stuff like concrete, cob, clay, stone or some combination of those.   One really popular method is to make a long pipe that U-turns back and then build a giant clay \"couch\".    After a bit of running the fire that couch will be pretty warm and they are ridiculously cozy on a cold winter day.  I've slept on them before.  \n\nHere's an [example](https://i.imgur.com/Al9L1Zt.jpg).  \n\nLots more [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=rocket+stove+mass+heater&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSq-qiw_XqAhUVHc0KHdssCi8Q_AUoAnoECDYQBA&amp;biw=1344&amp;bih=699).   \n\nBecause the rocket stoves are effectively an afterburner, you'll get a lot more heat out of the wood you burn.   With the long chimney and high mass to then capture and store that heat you can reach efficiency as high as 95%.   Compared to something like 5-20% for your typical wood stove setup.    \n\nToo anyone who has had to cut, haul, split and stack firewood, reducing your firewood usage by 80% is absolutely magical.   \n\nPlus, you can burn any kind of wood.  Due to the after burner effect there's no problem burning softwoods like pine.  That would wreck a normal setup and probably burn your house down.",

I would say a wet system is you best option for underfloor heating as a primary source of heat because it'll be alot more affordable to run. To do one of those rooms to just buy the matt and the insulation boards you would be looking at around \u20ac950 before vat but it will cost around 30 cent an hour to run! But have a look and drop us an email and we can have a look at a few things!",

The amount of calls I get after someone core holes into the floor and then remembers they have underfloor heating. But you can repair it with a repair kit fairly easily! When you watch the video you see they test the matt fairly regularly when the are laying it as this is the most dangerous time but once you get it down with no issues the majority of warranties are 10 or more years some with a lifetime warranty on the matt, its just a resistive wire at the end of the day! The only thing that you would see failing is the underfloor probe for the wall stat, you can see this near the end, that's just a rssistor at the end and they can fail but once its put in through a plastic pipe so you can remove and replace it you are golden.",

It's primarily a convenience/cost choice because you can use it for AC in the summer.\n\nRadiant heat is efficient and provides optimal comfort because it's source is physically at the level we live in - close to the floor. It's also heating up a large surface area that retains and gives off that heat even after the heating system (either electric or water boiler) has shut off. It also uses much lower temperatures than scorched air systems.\n\nI think the ideal home environment uses an efficient hot water boiler that provides heating water for radiant heat and also provides hot water for the home and a separate AC system using forced air (if your climate requires). Ductless AC units are another option although less aesthetically pleasing.\n\nOften when people build a home the last thing they decide on is the heating and cooling system - usually after they spent all their money on other upgrades. As a result they end up with the lowest cost/lowest comfort option.",

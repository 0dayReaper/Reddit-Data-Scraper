When fall comes, it starts to cool off on top, but the bottom of the lake is more insulated and doesn\u2019t cool as fast. Once the surface is the same temp as the bottom it can mix. A windy day can help it get started by stirring up the shallow waters. If the surface gets *colder* then the bottom, it will sink and cause the whole lake to mix at once. \n\nIn some lakes, that is the only time the lake mixes because in winter, a few different things can happen. The most dense temperature for water is 4\u00b0C. If the lake develops an ice sheet, then \u201cjust-above-freezing\u201d temp water is immediately under the ice, and slightly warmer water sinks to the bottom. In spring, when the ice thaws, the ice-water and \u201cjust-above-freezing\u201d temp water warm up to the same as the lake bottom water and it all mixes up again. \n\nOther kinds of lakes that don\u2019t get a winter ice sheet have different mixing schedules depending on how deep they are, their shape, and how salty they are.",

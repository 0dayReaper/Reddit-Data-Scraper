When the Titanic hit the iceberg they broke at a fraction of their rated strength and let water in all along the seams of the ship into multiple compartments instead of just the impacted compartment. Had they been made right the ships compartmentalization would have been successful and the ship wouldn't have sunk.",

If they had hit it straight on, they would only have ruptured the front compartment rather than scraping down the side.\n\nAlso, there were enough ships nearby to rescue all the passengers but they were fishing illegally, so they didn't answer the distress call, cos they knew they'd cop it.\n\nAlso also, my great great uncle was on the Titanic. He was kinda upset because his wife had just died. He was lounging around in his first class cabin, heard the collision clearly, thought \"whoopsie\" and went up on deck and hopped into a life boat. His surname was Anderson so he comes high on the passenger survivor lists.",

The main downside is riveting is very labor intensive, it also adds weight since you need plates to overlap. Bolting is faster, has the same downside with weight. Welding saves weight since you don't need overlap, labor varies.\n\nFor example before WWII the transition to welding saved hundreds of tons on warships and because treaties limited weight/displacement this meant the ships could use that weight for something else.",

Heat rivet, usually one by one, don't burn yourself, put it in place and either hammer/press it, which includes more burning hazards.\n\nCold riveting however is wiiiidely used today! It's basically the same as hot riveting, but without the hot!\n\nWe use a hydraulic press, weighs around 120kg, but suspended from a lifting tool, so very easy to handle.\nIt presses the rivet with between 30-33 tons of force, achieving basically the exact same as in video. It takes about 3 seconds, and no burning hazards and ovens. \nTo train someone new, takes maybe 1-2 weeks tops.\n\nSource: Volvo Trucks uses cold riveting, and I was/am deeply involved in the riveting process there",

Modern bridges, when maintained properly, last far longer than older ones.\n\nIt's like I'm reading opposite land here with your ignorant remarks. Stop posting, please.\n\nSource: Civil Engineer.",

Then similarly sized hot rivets were installed in adjacent holes and once they cooled the nut could be removed from the bolt by hand showing the much higher clamping force applied by the rivet.",

It would be reasonable to say that hydraulic presses were one of the enabling technologies for the industrial revolution in the early 1800's.",

Most things are welded or bolted but you might want to use them to save cost in factory production or leave a visual point of failure.\n\nRiveting with sheet metal still has practical advantages because you can get more strength than threaded hardware due to material thickness and it's extremely difficult or impossible to weld and you don't need access to the back side when using specialized rivets (blind rivets). You could bond it with glues or epoxies but that creates fire hazards and would be harder to test or maintain.",

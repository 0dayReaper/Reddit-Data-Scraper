It was us, the bartender, and a group of 4 Japanese locals. As we were talking to the bartender, this one bald dude from the group came over to us. He was very friendly, asked us about our lives, and we shared a few drinks. Then I asked him if he knew any clubs around the area. I shit you not. This dude got mad excited, told us to get dressed, called a cab and took us to the club. He legit dipped on his friends to help us. We had more drinks there and a good time before he said he had to leave because he had work early tomorrow. I'll never forget his constantly saying 'JAPNEEZ GURR VEYR EASEE' in broken English as he was trying to encourage us to make friends with some local girls at the place.\n\nStay cool, bald Japanese dude!",

If it's a place where they're wearing suits or you're spending lots of money, there will be a lot of deeper, longer bows. I remember when we bought our last car, they get the whole fucking staff, whoever they've got there that day, make them all come outside and hold a deep bow while you drive off. If just the one salesman wants to bow, go for it. I don't need 8-10 all holding a 90 degree bow while I wait to pull out of the lot.\n\nIt's just business. Some people overly romanticize it. \"Oh my god the Japanese are so polite. They say \"irasshaimase\" when you come into the sore and they all bow to you!\" Yeah. That's their job. Are you floored that someone at Walmart welcomes you? Same shit.",

I remember one time I was hanging out with some other exchange students, among them a Japanese woman. She drank and cursed like a sailor, a lot of fun. Another Japanese woman came and someone introduced them, she was up, bowing, doing the whole nice to meet you phrase, sat down again and slammed her beer. \n\nJust like when someone introduced me to another Norwegian, we had a handshake, did the whole \"where there are you from\" spiel and then back to drinks and fun. We learn some expected actions and phrases, learn where to use if, and then we can be ourselves outside of that.",

Bowing is a form of *respect*. When you bow to someone \"more important\" than you, it is absolutely expected that they also bow right back.\n\nFor example, if a common clerk is greeting their CEO, the CEO must also bow back to his clerk. When a schoolteacher steps into their classroom for the first time, they also bow right back to their bowing students. Customers leaving a store after an interaction with an employee also typically bow back at the staff.\n\nIs that other, more \"important\" person also submitting to you then? No, of course not, it's simply two people who are greeting each other and expressing that they respect each other.\n\nFrankly, the fact that Americans automatically equate bowing with submission instead of respect is quite interesting to me. Perhaps it has something to do with history?\n\nEdit: thanks for all the replies everyone. It seems that the reason Americans default bowing with submission indeed does have to do with history, specifically feudal England when lords used to own all the land. Fascinating insight into how two different cultures from different parts of the world view bowing due to history/philosophical values.",

Even if they don't actually give a shit about who they're bowing to, to do any less means getting chewed out by their bosses.  It's a cultural expectation.  \n\nI had to do this too whenever the truck guy came by to load up our stuff. We had to hold the bow until the truck driver drove out of line of sight.  My company also does this when seeing clients off at the elevator.  Bows are held until the doors close.",

    "title": "Cranberries grow in bogs in moist soil until they ripen. They are harvested by first adding several inches of water to the field; a tractor then rakes the berries off the bushes. Because ripe cranberries float, the fields are flooded and the berries are collected. The cranberries are then processed.",

Farmers used to literally bounce the berries down a set of stairs but they have a \"stair\" machine to do it now. Because this is all rough on the berries, these crops will be used exclusively in juice, jam or dried products. Any fresh, whole cranberries you find at a store were picked by hand in a dry field, not a flooded bog.",

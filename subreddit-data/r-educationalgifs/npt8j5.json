To transport 1kg of air you'd need huge pipes with ridiculous flows.\n\nIts why, for example, rocket engines use liquid propellants instead of pressurized gas. Because its a lot easier to pump the huge amounts of fuel rocket engines need as a liquid than as a gas. Its also why hydrogen is a finecky fuel to work with, even as a liquid its still very light, which means you need [massive pipes to move it around fast enough.](https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SSME-powerhead-1024x576.jpg)\n\nWhat you probably mean is that you can move large volumes of air more easily than large volumes of water.",

The ones in front of the foremast are specified as \"flying jibs\" so you can say clearly if you mean those or between masts (if there is more than one); identifying which sail specifically would be based on how many there are and how high in the sail plan it was rigged. \n\nThe phrase \"I like the cut of your jib\" roughly translates to plain English from sailing jargon as \"I like the way you do things\", literally saying the person likes how you've set up the sails on your ship.",

Edit: the flywheel spins in a vacuum inside the ball, the steel ball is literally just there to protect the ship if they explode\n\nThey don't have to be huge, just spin really really fast. A 300' boat has 2 gyros each weighing less than a ton, just a bit smaller than the trash dumpster you would find behind a restaurant. But they spin near 5000rpm, which is fucking fast.\n\nThey stabilize the boat through physics, not active control. All we do is get them spinning and keep them from moving too fast, the rest happens by itself, it's neat tech.\n\n[Heres how they work](https://veemgyro.com/how-gyrostabilizers-work/)\n\nThe tech shown in the drawing OP posted is new to me, I'm reading up on it now, cool stuff",

Moving the water at speed is the expensive part, so a large inlet is faster and more efficient than small pipes.\n\nAnd I bet there is some trick where most of the force creating the vacuum is generated by the water evacuating the other side. Like balancing a scale, you just need to add a little force to tip one way or the other.  Get the siphon started and let gravity fill the tanks back and forth. But that's purely my speculation.",

If he was going to be hitting *empty* when be got back, it only gave him about 15 gallons to troll with. And that is very much not a boat to do that with. Besides, it's a 16ishkn boat on a good day, and with how far out he wants to fish that's a 5 hour run.\n\nI'm betting that boat is for sale by now for something more appropriate for his needs.",

Rotating things will resist movement in other axis, so by rotating the ball that has the spinning disc allows you to counter the roll of the boat. \n\n[Here is a video from Veritasium on this topic](https://youtu.be/ty9QSiVC2g0)\n\nThe cost of this in terms of parts is not that crazy, one motor to spin the disc and perhaps a stepper motor to turn it, along with some accelerometers and something to cool the motors down. It\u2019s mostly the engineering costs, the software that handles the waves and such. I bet they have to tune it to the boat installed too, based on dimensions and weight and hull shape, then it may be fine tuned by hand because real world is weird and unpredictable.",

To move that amount of liquid you are going to have to use massive pumps and large piping, all of which takes up valuable space. \n\nFor the Catalina boat they would probably use something like a seakeeper. It's a gyroscope that sits inside to keep it more upright. \n\nOthers have fins that stick out underwater and pitch up and down to counteract the rolling motions, but you have to be moving for them to work. Others have drums that stick out underwater that also rotate, similar to the gyroscopes. And finally there's passive systems like bilge keels (flat wings that work by being a large surface area to resist motion in the water) or some fishing vessels have \"birds\" that are hydrofoils that hang off books out to the side that pull the boat down on both sides to resist the waves. \n\nI design boats. We use seakeepers sometimes.",

While fin stabilization has been the standard for most of the past century, the resurgence of gyrostabilizers and their vast improvements with technology shows a lot more promise than ballast-based systems. The first gyro-stabilizers had cooling, power and speed limitations. They've been largely able to vastly improve them today, with lighter and smaller flywheels, more reliable engineering with vacuuming sealing, higher build quality, and efficient closed cooling systems. [Seakeeper](https://www.seakeeper.com/technology/), an extremely popular maker of recreational stabilizers with a great website, has blown up in the past five years. I'm not too familiar with commercial/industrial sized stabilizers, but I would be shocked if they're not becoming more and more common too.",

They were made to be quite stable and their fire control would just take into account the roll of the ship for a firing solution, firing when level.\n\nIndeed: This actually might not have helped many ships, as you don\u2019t want a battleship that\u2019s too stable because then it\u2019s very difficult to fire at the most opportune moment",

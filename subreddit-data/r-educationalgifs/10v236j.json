Yeah they've got their own issues but nothing compared to the years of austerity here. Plus, the functioning healthcare is massively added bonus. I was there over christmas and fell ill, I saw a GP same fucking day, face to face, and that was even with calling them 2 hours after they'd opened - I had an appointment within the hour, on a Friday no less. I was fucking floored. Especially as I'm not even a native Aus and it was my third day in the country for the first time!",

We can model the boiling process and the heat conduction from the burner, and can do things like calculate the heat distribution in the bottom of the pan over time,-- but you want to know when and where the individual rising bubbles will break the surface? No way. That isn't part of any model we are doing, like a pea moving through space. That's just nature going, BLOOP HERE NOW WATCH ME MOVE YEAH. It's relatively spontaneous (from the viewpoint of any of our models and measurements).\n\nImagine this-- dump a small tray of broken concrete on a table, and measure EVERYTHING ON IT including the exact position of every piece. Now start shoving from one end with a hydraulic press. Our models still won't predict what happens to one particular pebble. Now go thousands of feet down and imagine trying to map a cubic meter of material that exactly, and even if you could, you wouldn't know what just that one cube of matter is going to do. Multiply that lack of knowledge by gazillion-billions.\n\nSometimes obviously, it \"looks\" like something might happen in a particular region on the surface. That's the best we got right now!",

It is recorded that it happens n times over x years and you can say that it has a y% probability to occur this year. These are seismic alea maps. \nNow it is possible to compute stress map derived from the strain of tectonics and the release of energy from former earthquake and have a rough idea of the stored energy and expected magnitude during earthquakes to come. San andreas one is overdue, it will be massive. \nBut to guess where and when there will be a rupture gets tricky. You would need to know where are the most weak points in the crust.",

It's a super-tiny shift event based on pressure accumulation and density changes that we can't come within orders of magnitude of having any usable data for. It is much smaller than the smallest analogous bubble appearing in a pot.\n\nWe can't measure anything in the core of the earth, by the way, we can only make rough guesses. And we don't understand the movement of tectonic plates-- we only observe them intelligently and make guesses. In space, we've gotten to the point where we know there's something messing with our models hugely, and we call it dark matter. But this is much harder than the most difficult of our crappy models so far-- it's a medium of pressure and density variations that we don't even have models for, yet. And it's big. We don't even have a supercomputer yet that could hold enough data points. But we don't know what data would even be in those data points. We only have guesses for what's in the Earth and what the deeper parts are composed of.\n\nConsider this-- we can only model fluid flow mathematically as an average of some sort of bits we can't define. Any models of earth flow would be about modelling those bits, and we don't even have a model of boundaries for what would make one of those bits. We are very very far from any models, would I guess be the answer. We know it's big and something probably shifts inside to make other things shift. That's about it.",

The biggest earthquake in Sweden measured in at 5,4 on the richter magnitude scale, it was recorded in Koster\u00f6arna in 1904. The earthquake that hit Turkey was around 7,8 on the richter scale. \n\nWhile I'm not that good with logarithmic scales, I did some googling and used a calculator to get the difference between the two events. A 7,8 wave is roughly 250 times bigger than a 5,4 and it releases around 3980 times more energy. Or in more human terms, 5,4 is powerful enough that you can feel it, and you might have to inspect buildings and infrastructure to make sure they didn't sustain any damage. 7,8 is strong enough to level most buildings not built to survive an earthquake.",

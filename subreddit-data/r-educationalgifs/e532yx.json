A perfect storm if you will",

Exceptions might be city-countries like Singapore or Monaco. But think of like for example how many 1-2 story homes there are in the suburbs vs how many skyscrapers there are in NYC.\n\nSo the difference between us and Haiti is we\u2019re 99.9% not skyscrapers and they\u2019re 100% not skyscrapers. Basically, that kind of (edit) high frequency earthquake is going to be the most devastating everywhere, not just Haiti. Especially since skyscrapers have so much money put into them that they\u2019re usually designed to withstand pretty serious earthquakes. Nobody bothers to test a single family home for earthquake resistance. \n\nI expect the bigger difference for why Haiti was hit so hard was a combination of cheaper building materials, cheaper home designs, and less public services available to address the issues.",

You are very correct. \n\n\nCodes are usually a good rule of thumb, because they are created given historical earthquakes in the region, and you only need a few earthquakes to know how the ground modifies the frequencies (known as receiver functions). Sources are also relatively predictable in frequency content (in fact, theoretically, sources are all alike in spectrum, the only modifying factor is the magnitude, the ground is responsible for most if not all frequency variations...this is a huge discussing point btw).\n\nSo basically the only problem is amplitude. If you shake the table strong enough, at one point frequency stops being the problem, it will fall if given enough energy, so when building there is always some hope for a non catastrophic mega event, and you prepare for whatever frequencies your surrounding ground decided to favor.",

A short string on a guitar (high pitch) vibrates quickly, al long string (like the string on a bass, low pitch) vibrates slowly. These \"buildings\" take over frequencies they could produce themselves, i.e. long building responds to slow shocks (it needs time to do a full oscillation) and a short building responds to quick waves (it needs less time to oscillate).\nDoes this makes sense to laymen?\nEdit: silver just for doing my job, thanks!",

You can think about it like putting a rod in the ground, if the rod is really long you can bend it easily, however, if it is short you, it is much harder to bend it.\n\nSeismic response is generally dictated by the mass and stiffness of a structure. However, in this case the mass of all three systems are relatively similar, therefore this is stiffness dominated scenario. As such, when the stiffness goes up, a structures natural frequency drops. When the professor applied a long frequency action to the structure it illicited a resonance response.\n\n Resonance is why a sustained C# can break glass, the note matches the natural frequency of the glass and causes the glass to oscillate rapidly, because the waveforms of the sound and glass overlap, resulting in an increase in amplitude. In this case, an increase in amplitude would be more displacement or deformation. Because glass is very stiff and brittle, it is not able to deform much and shatters.",

Piano combines both length and tension.\n\nThis all has to do with impulse traveling through the object. If you hit impulses with correct delay their power will get added together the maximum of the addition is at the resonance frequency. The delay is the function of the length of the object and the speed the impulse travels through the object. This speed is function of materials the object is made of tension in the object.",

When the frequency of an input (the earthquake) is close to that natural frequency it will cause resonance. Changing the building's natural frequency to be either lower or higher than the input frequency will reduce its oscillation at that frequency",

Every object has a natural frequency, and when something else is vibrating at that same frequency and comes into contact with that object, it will make that object oscillate as well.\n\nIf your piano is tuned properly and you strike the key of the note your tuning fork is calibrated to, it will actually cause the tuning fork to osculate (without having need to be struck).\n\nThe most catastrophic example of resonance I remember studying is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.  [There's a video of that bridge swaying violently like a motherfucker before it finally rips apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbOjxPCfaFk) and collapses.  The video makes it seem like winds were blowing at 100mph, but the winds were only a measly 40mph.  But those relatively mild winds produced aeroelastic flutter that matched the bridge's natural frequency, causing that resonance effect leading to its eventual collapse.",

There are a lot of good answers here in terms of resonance, but I'm not sure that's the most laymen ready explaination.\n\nThink about it this way: the vibrations at the base take time to travel to the top (just like sound takes time to travel). So when the base moves to the right, the top does also but slightly delayed, and more delayed depending on the height. Same when the base moves to the left.\n\nNow if the timing works out so the base moves left-right-left in the same time it takes the top to move left, they will appear to move together and energy will transfer very efficiently.\n\nOn the other hand (or the other two heights) if the timing doesn't match, the base will move left-right by the time the top only moves left... Or if the timing is out the other way the base would move left-right-left-right.. either way the bases movement travels up the pole and counteracts the previous movement that went up the pole, it cancels out the movement.\n\nBecause each have a different height, they each have a different timing (frequency) that makes them work in sync with the base.",

If you \"tune\" to 100.3MHz, then 100.3MHz signals will be amplified while others are not. Same applys to seismic activity. But instead of changing the value of a tuning capacitor/inductor you're tuning the elasticity(height)/mass of a building.\n\nMany tall buildings use a \"Tuned mass dampener\" that de-amplifies at the resonant frequency of the building. It basically generates a negative gain at that frequency.",

Other explanations are good, but let me take a swing at it.\n\nLike others said, this is activating the resonant frequency of the system.\n\nImagine you have a pi\u00f1ata hanging in front of you, motionless, and then you smack it with a stick. Assuming it doesn\u2019t break, the pi\u00f1ata will move away from the force of your strike, but the rope it\u2019s hanging from will force it to swing back like a pendulum. It would swing back and forth. The periodic motion corresponds to the natural frequency of the system. In that case, the thwack is a stimulus with a huge range of frequencies, the system responds by picking out its own natural frequency.\n\nThe frequency response is generally determined by materials and geometry. In this case, we can say buildings of different height correspond to pi\u00f1atas hanging from different lengths of rope. A pi\u00f1ata on a longer rope would have a lower resonant frequency, basically because the wave would take more time to travel the longer length of rope.",

When you release the force, it springs back past its original position and bends a little in the other, then springs back in the direction of the force again, and so on - it oscillates. It does this at a specific frequency (the resonant frequency).\n\nNow apply a force as it's naturally springing back the first time - you're forcing a bent object, making it bend even more than the first time around (bend from 2nd force + springback from 1st force). And when you release that, the springback from *that* will be added to the 2nd springback from the *1st*. At that point, you force it again in the first direction, and it bends farther still (bend from 3rd force + springback from 2nd force + 2nd springback from 1st force).\n\nAn oscillating force is one that gets applied in opposite directions in the pattern of a sine wave; not only is it applied in opposite directions, but its magnitude in each direction follows a sine wave.\n\nA resonating object's displacement follows a dampened (decreasing in magnitude over time) sine wave.\n\nMatching the frequencies and directions of the two means that at every moment, you're forcing it in the direction it's already naturally springing from the sum of all previously applied forces.",

There is something called a natural frequency, which is related to the stiffness of the structure and its mass. When the stiffness goes up, so does the natural frequency. Generally, if a building is taller, it is less stiff than a short building, and its natural frequency is also lower, so thats why it responds to lower frequency earthquakes. Higher stiffness=higher natural frequency\n\nAnother way to describe it, if you pulled on a building hard enough for it to deflect, and then let it go, it would go back and forth at a certain rate which is its natural frequency. If you apply load to it (sideways, or laterally) at the same frequency as the natural frequency, the effects are amplified \n\nThis is obviously simplifying it a lot, and typical structures have more than one natural frequency, but this is the general idea",

On the other hand the swinging of the weight will also cause forces to the base what the guy can easily feel. If he increases or decreases the frequency too much, he will start feeling opposite force as now the weight tries to swing on a wrong time. Same as you would try to push guy in a swing when he come at you. This is actually comes quite naturally with people and because of that there is time to time problems with pedestrian bridges. One bridge in London had to be closed as it was swinging too much when people were walking on it. It wasn't dangerous but caused discomfort in the pedestrians. One reason for this is that when the bridge started to sway a little, people would automatically change their walking speed so that it matches the vibrations of the bridge. Walking is basically a alternating load so when the people started to walking at the same frequency with the bridge, a resonance happened and the swaying got worse and worse and thus caused discomfortable experience.",

When the ground shakes due to an earthquake it can shake upwards of 100 times per 1 second or 1000 seconds per 1 shake! The magnitude is an estimate of the energy released during the earthquake and its well known because it tells us how intense the ground shaking is.  Now we are able to start predicting the frequency of the earthquakes too. To do this you need to know about the fault that created the earthquake and what it traveled to when it gets to your building. We are using supercomputers to do this right now but hopefully we will be able to do it on your own personal computer in the future.",

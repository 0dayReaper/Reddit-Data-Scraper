Most common are regular meshes made out of tetrahedrons aligned in such a way to make a regular rectangular grid. If you draw it out, you'll see there are lots of diagonals. Since computers aren't infinitely precise, this leads to small differences of influence along differently-sized edges (simplifying a bit, but overall true).\n\nAnd yes, in Navier-Stokes simulations, simulations are crazy sensitive to starting condition.",

In this case, you could've also written 2D equations that would model the same flight path and get the same visual effect at the end.\n\nTo contrast this, flow equations behave very differently. The flow you see in 3D compressed into 2D is actually very different than the flow you see just simulating in 2D.

Essentially, it comes from the fluid slowing down and going from laminar flow (which is fast and smooth) to turbulent flow, which is slower and more chaotic. \n\nAs a fluid slows down, it will tend to create these vortices mainly because of the bumping of molecules with other molecules. It\u2019s kind of like how a ball thrown at a can pyramid can knock it down but a slow ball might bounce off.",

            "comment": "What I would assume is happening here, but I could be mistaken, is related to the energy cascade of the system. A normal 3d fluid usually form eddies that would break into smaller ones until dispassion takes over. On the other hand, 2D fluid systems behave differently, as they, contrary to the 3D case, have a reverse cascade of energy, I.e. smaller eddies will aglutinate into bigger eddies up until a certain scale. On a side note, It can, however, happen in some very specific 3d cases provided that this case behaves as a 2d case, i.e. no vertical change in density and velocity, and small surface pressure (shallow water scale system). I even have heard that hurricanes for example can display this reverse energy cascade on their base and that it helps to input energy on the overall hurricane system. Regardless, that is just my guess on what's happening in the video.",

So if you put a bit of left on the cue ball, you have to adjust where you\u2019re aiming slightly to the left as well - because the cue ball will come off the cue on a bit of an angle and go right.

If a smooth rolling ball hits another smooth ball, it transfers linear momentum to the other ball, but little or no angular momentum is transferred, so the ball is still trying to roll forward even though it's been stopped linearly. The forward spin of the ball again causes the ball to move forward more after striking the object ball due to friction.\n\nBy striking slightly below center, you can cause the ball to counteract the natural tendency to begin rolling forward, and the ball essentially slides along the cloth instead of rolling. Thus, when it transfers its linear momentum to the object ball, there's nothing remaining to cause it to continue moving forward again.",

Generally you need to shoot *away* to avoid the foul if its frozen. with little space you have to shoot *down*.\n\nSometimes you can get away with a quick controlled poke, but you dont have room for a normal controlled stroke.\n\nIn bars people are notoriously bad about this foul. Ask anyone you know that plays a fair amount of pool, they should be able to demonstrate this. The speed the cue \"maintains\" is generally a dead giveaway of a foul.\n\nOften its a case of  hitting the cue ball twice in many cases. cue leaves your tip, hits the object ball, then is stuck again. Differentiating between a double hit and a push? I'd need a camera lol.\n\nThe guy in the vid? world class, but he cant put enough follow on a shot to mimic an egregious push shot/double hit\n\nAs for the \"spinning tire\" for follow (top) and draw (bottom) it depends on how clean the balls are and how clean and what type of cloth you're on.\n\nPlaying with s clean surface on good cloth and lean balls is amazing compared to the average bar table which horrible in comparison.\n\nYou can *throw* dirty balls much harder, but dirty cloth and balls is terrible for draw shots.\n\nHitting the object ball full on absorbs most of the forward momentum From that point the spin influences the path quite a bit.\n\n[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vvNXHltWs) Is an example of how far you can take a draw shot.",

The more accurate a hit you get on the object ball the less spin you need to get the desired result.\n\nHow dirty the cloth cue ball is plays a big part. Humidity can too.\n\nShooting softer to start out will let you aim lower, as you add some power back in you'll start to scoop again.\n\nYou have to use a smooth stroke. jerky motions will work against you.",

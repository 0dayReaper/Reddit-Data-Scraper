People at the time wrote about the grided streets extending as far as they could see but without any buildings. It was all eventually filled in but it took awhile.",

There's Henday (the ring road), Whitemud (east-west towards the south, with the north-south leg over the river) and Sherwood Park Freeway (east-west, but only pokes halfway into the city on the east side). Yellowhead (the east-west corridor on the north side) is only just being upgraded to a freeway.\n\nAll of the other highways poke out around the outside of the ring road, but are otherwise regular city streets within the ring road. There was a plan to surround the city centre with freeways in the 60s, but the only part that was ever built before being stopped was a 6 lane bridge into the city centre.",

It is easier to make few roads and put low density housing than build skyscrapers or apartment buildings.\n\nThe only other option is to build 6-10-15 story apartment buildings but they come with their own problems (weight, unstable soil, density bringing conflicts etc...)\n\nI think urban sprawl is now coined by developers who want to build dense and profitable but need some zoning plans adjusted and this must be supported by people. People who gain almost nothing from density.\n\nThe whole city design is a big pile of problems and even cities and architects cant do it decently. \nMany cities have been designed and built only to discover different problems.",

Low density suburban developments have infrastructure costs orders of magnitude higher than dense, urban areas. The property tax load should be adjusted so that everyone pays fairly for their slice of land.\n\nEg: A single-family homeowner is taxed at a rate 10x that of the residents of a 10-unit condo building occupying the same footprint.\n\nBut instead property taxes are based on the assessed value of a given property, skewing the tax load heavily towards dense, urban areas despite the actual cost of maintaining said areas being far lower. Any attempt to address this disparity is inevitably framed as unfairly victimizing families because we've all been sold the notion that you need a detached home with half an acre of grass around it that you don't touch with anything other than a lawnmower more than 4 times a year in order to keep your kids form transforming into criminal drug addicts.",

It is a myth spread by probably developers. I did some checks of smaller cities across canada and almost everywhere the taxes are much lower than in big cities in much denser neighboorhoods.\n\nIf that would be true then rural places would have much higher taxes. But they dont.\n\nGo out and check yourself.\n\nHow come smaller cities have similar services as the bigger ones but the cost of maintenance is higher?\n\nWell, in winnipeg the tax pays for police (1/3 of the tax), schools (another 1/3) and then the \"mythical sprawl\" - measly 1/3 of the tax.\n\nRoughly 700CAD per year pays for the infrastructure. The rest is schooling and police. And that has very little to do with how windy, wide the streets are or sprawled the neighboorhood is.\n\nAlso the idea of tying the area of land to a tax is BS. I repeat, BS!\n\nIn winnipeg your share of infrastructure is 1/3 of the property tax. But the folk livin in a condo rides bus as much as the folk who lives in a house. And the pipes/cables are paid in electrical and water/waste bill.\n\nThe streetsare very small fraction of the tax so maybe, HUGE MAYBE the folk from condo could pay 100-200cad less per year because he lives in dense place.\n\nI could go on and on on this. The problems with city taxes are not in a sprawl. They are in multiple places but the sprawl is used to push propaganda fueling developers profits.\n\nSure, cities are designed badly but not because of city sprawl. Sure, you can have density but you will pay for it in different ways.",

These areas are often low density and the tax base is too low to recoup the costs for long term maintenance of the infra so tax base will need to come from other citizens / businesses.",

That means they have to clear snow, cut grass, maintain horticulture, maintain street lights, etc. with 20% the tax revenue of a more densely populated City. The operational budget hasn't increased in years but they require the maintenance crews to maintain more and more each year. Another big factor is amenities: they want all citizens to be within ~15mins of all major amenities. This is increasingly difficult if the population is spread out. Instead of, say, 5 rec centres now they need 10. To add to that, Edmonton's goal to be a green city and have every citizen live within 5min walking of the green and blue network (River Valley trail system) becomes increasingly difficult and expensive as the City sprawls.",

Meadowlark Mall was not opened until the 50's as Edmontons first real mall. there were corner stores everywhere. The first Mcdonalds did not open until 75/76 in Edmonton\n\nThere were more close places than you realize but because people could afford a car and it was dirt cheap to go anywhere ($0.99 a gallon or less) people drove. Only in the 80's did small places shut down and mega malls really took over. Really miss the old drive up and park A&amp;W's with the rollerblade staff as well as the various drive in theatres.\n\nI am a fourth generation Edmontonian and even remember the old wooden ski jump than you literally drove under going up Conners Hill. I used to climb to the top of it when I was a kid and it was old and shut down then. (built 1912 - used until 1975 and dismantled in 1978)\n\nhttp://www.skisprungschanzen.com/photos/can/edmonton/02.jpg\n\nGod I'm old",

They drive a series of piles in two rows and fill the middle with earth. I don't know for sure about the actual process of driving the piles but I imagine it's still pretty similar to today. They anchor a boat and then use a large heavy object (stone or metal?) and repeatedly lift and drop it onto the pile, driving it into the earth slowly just like a hammer on a nail.",

Like the Egyptians used to attach logs to the stones and float them in a man-made canal, to make it easier to move them around by one or two people.  It also allowed them to easily work and rotate the stones.",

A big part of how they designed these things was based around the logistics of how they could get the materials there.  That's why a lot of ancient structures are built right next to the queries where the stone was cut from.  \n\nThe Egyptians had bigger ideas though.  They wanted to build stuff where they wanted to build it, regardless of where the resources were, and had the know how to make it happen.  I think the nearest quarry to the pyramids was like 20 miles away or something like that.  Everything about the logistics of building the pyramids would have been based around how they could get these massive stones there.  They would have also probably used all sorts of different techniques throughout different stages of construction.",

Then you can put an approximate straight edge against the edge, make marks, flip the edge over, and correct until the marks match.\n\nTo get those perfectly flat surfaces you take three things and rub them against each other until they're all flat, as the only geometry three things have in common is a plane. That's how surface plates are made to this day.\n\nNowadays you can get a melanin board and do the flipping and get an accuracy the Romans could only dream of. Certainly good enough to check cheap squares from Alibaba.\n\nMuch of early engineering simply didn't care about angles that much and they used knotted ropes for the angles: 12 evenly spaced knots in a rope loop give you 12 sections, lay them out as a 4:3:5 triangle, where 4 and 3 meet there's a right angle (because 5^2 = 4^2 + 3^2). Enough to get a house square enough so it won't mess up your planning grid.",

The world is full of fascinating true stories that they could make endless shows about and all the producers have to do is ***read a fucking book.***",

Season 2... meh.\n\nBut, importantly, you can watch just season 1 and be perfectly happy, there's a full story there. So folks who haven't seen _Rome_ should _absolutely_ watch it... but just season 1.\n\nAnother show that IMO fits this bill is Dexter. Someone could watch just seasons 1, 2, and 4 of Dexter (and optionally season 3) and it's a great show! But watch to the end and you'll be disappointed. But there's no need to watch to the end! Anyone who hasn't seen it should totally watch those seasons and then just stop after 4 and chances are they'll really enjoy it.",

They follow his life from birth to death while telling different stories to show how Rome worked and how he rose to power. Arguably the best book series I've read.\n\n\"Iggulden brings to life the glorious, gritty Roman world that held such vast power in its hands. These epic novels brilliantly interweave history and adventure, and expose the ambition and rivalry, bravery and betrayal, all told from one of the most vivid voices in historical fiction today.\"",

I was just watching a documentary yesterday about how Rome had a dedicated force of about 700 workers whose only job it was was to make sure that the aqueducts were able to deliver water and not get clogged. This involved removing obstructions as well as periodically scraping calcium deposits from the walls of the lead piping because their diameter would gradually get smaller as calcium built up. The also said that the romans knew that the lead caused health issues, but used it anyway because they knew the calcium deposits would somewhat form a barrier over the lead. \n\nIt was super interesting... dont know why i brought it up though lol.\n\nFurther info:  http://www.romanaqueducts.info/technicalintro/lead1.htm",

The second arch on the northwest side was then later destroyed in 1760 by the Spanish to stop the Portuguese advancing and was repaired in 1762 by Charles III, only to be blown up again in 1809 by Wellington's forces attempting to stop the French. Temporary repairs were made in 1819, but much of the bridge was destroyed yet again in 1836 by the Carlists. The bridge was rebuilt in 1860 using mortared masonry.",

We don't because nobody's willing to drop a hundred billion dollars to build those roads, even if it meant we wouldn't have to spend tens of billions every year keeping them up.\n\nIt's just literally a straight up trade-off - how much do you want to spend on infrastructure, and how long does it need to last. Most of the roads in the US were built to last about 50 years with the *then* projections of how much traffic there would be, and most of them were built about 70 years ago with vastly more and heavier traffic in the form of the 18-wheeled tractor trailer, hence why roads all over the US are completely falling apart - they're simply overdue for replacement and overhaul to bring them up to modern design standards.\n\nExcept, nobody like spending money on infrastructure, because it's a money sink. So instead everyone allows the roads to fail and crumble while they pocket the money on more lucrative, exploitable infrastructure deals. Instead, they patch the existing roads with asphalt that they know will erode away in no time, because it's vastly cheaper than the alternative of rebuilding the roads.\n\nThat's all it is. It's a question of how do you want to spend money. And this generation of leaders would rather spend that money making themselves richer than invest in the future.",

It's how they got water moving through their famous aqueducts, e.g. Famously the Archimedes screw pump was used everywhere from ancient Rome to ancient Egypt; it probably existed (possibly even centuries) before Archimedes documented it around 250BCE.\n\nSure they probably bucket brigaded sometimes, but it's just as likely they had a bunch of people turning wooden screw pumps and later on running metal hand piston pumps that they've found remains of all around Rome. They might have even used animals to drive the pumps with various means of power transmission.\n\nI'm not sure it really counts as \"rest of the owl\" material though.",

The technology of ancient rome was pretty impressive, they even had cranes to lift and set the heaviest blocks: https://youtu.be/20U58-S02qw \n\nIt's crazy how close this all resembles modern day construction of large structures. But instead of having gas powered machines do the heavy lifting, you just had to get a lot of dudes to pull some rope. Like the machine to drive the piles into the river really hasn't changed since ancient roman times.",

Buckets, archimedes screws, siphons....or even just letting it evaporate. The parts of Europe, Africa and the Middle East Romans developed were pretty sunny and hot in the summer, wouldn't have taken long for all the water to go it's own way, they could have used the time to gather other materials etc.",

We are starting to reclaim our traditional practices and culture, but much was lost and many young people don\u2019t speak the same language as our elders. Our environment is of course cold, but is warming very quickly with climate change, so that has made it difficult to relearn hunting skills because the sea ice is unpredictable and dangerous to travel on now. Hunting is still an important part of life, but now we use motor boats, snowmobiles and quads, and use rifles and naphtha camp stoves, etc. \n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, colonization and being forced from a semi-nomadic collectivist society to a sedentary wage based capitalist society has caused a shitload of problems for us and there is quite a bit of anger and bitterness because of it. Canada treats indigenous peoples like shit, and many of us would prefer to go back to our traditional ways, but that is no longer an option. ",

Some communities get gouged in prices sometimes paying as much as 10$ for a single can of pop or juice. Fresh foods tend to be even more expensive even with a government run subsidy program that has no real oversight and has had the Northwest company reaping profits by not passing on true savings to the community. They also had a huge fire in the capitals main store recently that caused smoke damage to a lot of items. They reopened the main store after 8 days and still sold product at half price that still had spot on it from the fire. They put baby wipes at the end of each isle so customers could wipe them off.

Canada didn\u2019t stop residential schools until the 1990s, and still have basically the same attitude towards us. As to what I think should be changed, well, actually following through on the crown\u2019s obligations that were agreed to in our Nunavut Land Claim Agreement, and indigenous treaties in general would be a nice place to start. One big point of contention with the NLCA was Canada\u2019s insistence on extinguishing our aboriginal title to our ancestral lands, and making us agree in perpetuity to never seek independence. Canada would not agree to any land claim unless we agreed to those clauses. The land claim agreement gave Canada the green light to plunder our resources, and they didn\u2019t bother to try to live up to their end of the agreement. Everyone and their drunk uncle love to point out how much money indigenous peoples get from the government but never seem to realize that under the land claim agreement, the crown takes 98% of resource royalties from most of the mining and other industrial development on our lands.\n\nWe are not completely opposed to industrial development on our lands, but as the original inhabitants, we want Canada to abide by the principles of prior, informed, consent, and to have some semblance of control over what happens in our back yard. Instead, the government shits all over us, allows resource extraction corporations to operate in our lands with near impunity, doesn\u2019t provide us with basic government services as stipulated in our land claim agreement and gaslights us about it constantly. We, like anyone else mostly want to live our lives free from people in a distant, foreign city controlling every aspect of our lives. We also want the right to self-determination, which has been aggressively denied to us. We want to be treated with basic dignity, and not to be exploited constantly. ",

An igloo would suffice if you couldn\u2019t find the cabin or had a long way to go before getting there and needed rest. They\u2019re also usually checked first by search parties. ",

This helps with structural integrity. You pretty much just dig straight in and seal yourself in with a little hole for ventilation. Once inside your body heat melts a layer of ice in the inside which also helps with the structure and facilitated insulation.  The key here is to make it a cave so the air can warm up. ",

This is in contrast to an igloo, which is built up from blocks of hard snow, and a snow cave, constructed by digging into the snow.  The word is of Athabaskan origin, and entered the English language by 1984. A quinzhee can be made for winter camping and survival purposes or for fun.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

A quinzhee is what you build if the snow is not deep and compacted enough. \n\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to wait 2 hours if the snow is cold enough and separates when you shovel it. \n\nAlso, If you shovel out the \u201cfloor\u201d down to the ground first before you start to pile the snow it is usually ready to be hollowed out as soon as you are happy with the size of your pile. \n\nSome old timer told me the latent \u201cheat\u201d from the bare forest floor help speed up the resting phase. When you throw it back into your pile, the more the granules of snow move against each other the better. You want every granule to be touching a new a different granule. It might be BS but I\u2019ve always done it this way and it works. \n\nI\u2019ve  found that once you get sick and tired of piling snow, take a break, mark your wall thickness with sticks and the snow will be rested and good to go. \n\nSource: I\u2019ve built a bunch, slept in a few.

He asked if the guy had ever *had* to build one to survive, and he said he had, once, coming back from a hunting trip late at night and he fell through the ice. He got out, built an igloo, then the next day made clothes out of the caribou he'd been bringing back to replace his wet clothes. It's a great program. The guide is a fascinating bloke. ",

It would be kinda similar to caulk for brick laying.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if that's correct so hopefully someone else can answer this.\n\nEdit: The builders leave a small hole in the top to let the smoke escape but they rarely need a fire if they have several people. Also, the mass of the snow/ice of the igloo is much higher along with a high heat capacity compared to the air inside the igloo, it melts slowly.  ",

This compacts the snow. You need to be careful because sometimes there's a crust about 6 inches and then everything underneath is powder. For insulation you need minimum 8 inches, preferably more. \n\nIt can take a hot minute to find the right snow, let alone harvesting it. \n\nThen you need to cut this shit perfectly. If it's not perfect you're going to spend hours \"chinking\" which is taking small misshapened snow blocks and filling the gaps, then covering the whole inside  and outside with spare snow until there are no pinholes. You need complete coverage so your body heat can warm the space and not let it escape. \n\nYou also should not just build a door straight in. Instead you could dig down and out like a tunnel to create a cold sump, so all the cold air can sink into one spot.\n\nTotal time, with instruction, spades, and 6 snow saws between 8 people: 4 hours. \n",

I suspect the igloo does make it a tad warmer than the outdoors, but the greater impact is on windchill factor reduction.\n\nEdit: I take that back, per Wikipedia: On the outside, temperatures may be as low as \u221245 \u00b0C (\u221249 \u00b0F), but on the inside the temperature may range from \u22127 \u00b0C (19 \u00b0F) to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) when warmed by body heat alone.\n\nThat\u2019s nuts!",

As far as the shape, you would have two elevations inside. You would rest in the higher part where all the hot air goes, while the cold air gathers at the bottom. (Edit: you would use part of the inside of the igloo for structural blocks. This is where two elevations come from. You rest at ground level next to a hole. The entrance is also this slow so you usually crawl in) \n\nThe heat in all of this is coming from you. The more people inside the quicker it gets hotter. Edit for clarification: if it's -50\u00b0F outside, your igloo can be as warm as 0-10\u00b0F. Some igloos might be lined with skins inside which could keep another 10\u00b0F inside.",

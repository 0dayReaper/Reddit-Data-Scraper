She used to wake us up as early as 3am before we got the timed feeder. Now she only complains for dinner. (We give her wet food for dinner. I'd rather not put that in the timed feeder.) I guess she realized she can't convince an inanimate object to feed her sooner. On the weekends we get to witness her sitting patiently and quietly staring at the feeder anticipating lunch. (It's freakin' adorable.)\n\nIt is fun to see her go crazy though. I should upload a video to r/aww.\nOne of my favourite things to do is whisper it into her ear when she has slept past her dinner time. She immediately wakes up in a frantic daze like when you wake up on a day off thinking you're late for work. It's hilarious.",

He always has dry food out so he\u2019s not starving, it\u2019s only wet food that he\u2019s fed on a schedule. \n\nI feed him when I wake up in the morning (shift work so can be any time) and last thing before bed, so it\u2019s not the same time every day. I also never call him to be fed which i think is the main reason he never begs. He knows he gets fed whether he\u2019s begging or not, so he doesn\u2019t bother to beg because it doesn\u2019t work. He comes and sits with me in bed every morning until I get up and feed him, but he doesn\u2019t meow at me or try to get me up, he just waits. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that we haven\u2019t been feeding him wet food for long (6 months, dry food only before on the vets advice) and he would howl until everyone was awake. At the beginning he got worse with the howling, but after he learnt that he gets fed if he\u2019s there or not, he\u2019s calmed down.  Sometimes he comes and finds me at night because he\u2019s waiting to be fed, but again he doesn\u2019t really beg, he just sits with me.",

But there are a lot of other factors at play here, many which also cause women to have lower sex drives. A few examples\n\n- The fact that being promiscuous is a positive trait for men and a negative for women (in society at large, slowly changing for the better thankfully)\n\n- Men get off a lot easier from penetrative sex and is a reason they derive more pleasure from it than Women. (How much would you like penetrative sex if you never came from it?)\n\n- It's a lot more risky for a woman to follow a man home from the bar than it is for the man. Women are disproportionately more the victim of rape and sexual assault.\n\nAll of those can be reduced and some even eliminated and likely will in my lifetime following Western societies trajectory over the last 30 years. And I promise you that in 30 years the notion that wives and women in general don't want sex will be considered nonsense.",

Sex becomes 'hop on, love' and that's about it.\n\nWhat about the affection of brushing her hair behind her ear, hugging her from behind, doing the washing up when it's her turn just because. Calling her from work just to hear her voice. It may not be sexual or lead directly to sex, but it's athese things that make a woman feel wanted, therefore desired, and more interested on reciprocating physical intimacy.\n\nIt's not that wives taper off sex. It's that men often taper off the range of foreplay, then scratch their heads and wonder why the women are losing interest.",

Essentially, once the animal learns to receive a treat by following your hand you can draw tricks in the air.

You're tricking the cat into doing the action you want, and then rewarding them.  The other method is freeshape, where you just wait for the animal to do something you want to teach them, and then reward them with a treat.  Eventually they learn that you're rewarding them for doing a specific thing and then you can give it a name and start working on having them repeat it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast time I had a dog, we signed up for basic training classes.  First assignment they gave us was basically spend 10 minutes a day doing nothing but saying the dogs name, and when the dog looks at you, give them a treat. And if you're trying the \"clicker\" route, you'd click the clicker.   According to them, this was basically the most important thing you'll teach a dog because it gives you a way to break the dog's focus if they get distracted.  Once the dog learns to stay focused, it makes everything else much easier to train.   It definitely seemed to help.  Anytime we'd be out walking and another animal would get his attention, he responded much quicker to me than previous animals where I didn't do that.",

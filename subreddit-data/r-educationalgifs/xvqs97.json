But the combined (multiplied)  values of all those dashed lines must be maximized to get the best fit. There are a couple of optimization techniques to do this but I'll have to make a separate animation for that, from hill climbing to gradient descent.\n\nJosh Starmer goes into more depth here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfKanl1aSG0",

I'll work on a better visualization of this later.\n\nBut to calculate the total likelihood, multiply the true y-values, and then for the false values multiply  (1 - y) instead of y. Multiply all those together and you got total likelihood. \n\nIf you have floating point issues on a computer (which is likely)  take the log() of each y and (1 -y) value and add them instead of multiply, and then call exp() to convert the result back.",

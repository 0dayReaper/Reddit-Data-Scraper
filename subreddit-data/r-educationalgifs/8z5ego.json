Applications get filled up with kids who don't really give a shit or know anything about the job because online forms are so easy. The forms are generally so rigidly structured that all the passionate kids are indistinguishable from the kids shitting out 20 applications an hour. If you email someone specifically asking about a job and explaining why you're interested in what they do and how you can contribute, that looks amazing. I'd want you on a team over some rando that needs the job experience",

We had to remove sediment from scales of a ginormous dinosaur lizard and then had to draw illustrations of the fossils that were worthy enough for bio journal publication. Sounded easy but man did I suck at this. To top it off the scales were on loan from Harvard. First day, spilled glue all over research table and equipment. Next day, air drilled part of the fossil and chipped it off.  There was old glue on the fossil already that had same coloration as the fossils so for the semester I used my best guess which was which. The professor wouldn\u2019t say if I was doing a good or bad job, so I drilled away. The drawing part I thought would be a cake walk. Nope. The paper he used for illustrations was no longer manufactured. And had around 70 sheets left. I blew through a hand full in the first couple weeks. Never found out if I ever did get published. Did get an A for the research assistant credits but probably out of sympathy.",

This is one of the best museums I\u2019ve ever been to, and it\u2019s not even a home town bias.  I truly recommend stopping by if you ever visit Pittsburgh.  \n\nCarnegie built the museum to be accessible to all, no matter your income. When I was growing up (born in mid 80\u2019s) the museum was donation based admission only, the way he intended it, but they changed that.  However, if someone has an Access card, they get admission for $1. ",

Under an electron microscope, you can see they are quite porous. [[image](http://www.feelguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CavityTooth.jpg)]  \n\nUnder some conditions, the original material, especially mineral components, can be at least partially preserved.  Alternately, the mineral material may be dissolved and displaced or reformulated into more stable minerals.  In other classes of fossils, they simply leave a void which is filled by other material, or they leave an impression on more durable media.\n\nTeeth are quite hardy as fossils, and we know the most about organisms that do leave fossils.  Soft-bodied organism traces are harder to find.  Ediacarian fossils are notable mainly as fossil teeth from some of the earliest pre-Cambrian organisms to actually leave hard fragments.",

They probably wanted to keep him interested in the sciences (spoiler: he isn\u2019t)\n\nFun fact - we were skipping rocks at the lake and he found it just off the shore. He was about to throw it until he felt the serrated edges and looked at it closer. \n\nFound at Lake Castaic, California",

The matrix in which the tooth was found may be hard enough to merit using slightly harder blasting agent.\n\nFossil teeth are going to be similar to those of modern mammals: dentine and enamel. The outer surface is enamel, which is primarily [hydroxyapatite;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite) this in turn is calcium phosphate- Moh's hardness of 5. Bones also contain hydroxyapatite, but tooth enamel contains more, and are harder and tougher as a result- one of several reasons why we find more teeth than other remains as fossils.\n\nAnyway- my guess would be that because the teeth are harder than bones, a higher concentration of dolomite helps to remove the matrix rock while not substantially increasing the risk of damage to the tooth itself.\n\nEDIT: [Quite the science, air abrasion media.](http://www.thefossilforum.com/index.php?/topic/32825-air-abrasion-media/) Entire [books](https://books.google.com/books?id=10m3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA389&amp;lpg=PA389&amp;dq=fossil+%22sodium+bicarbonate%22+dolomite&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KhyRTbzYXs&amp;sig=ZnlT5txw76L36hjXtGMOytXUekc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEnfvQtqLcAhXmHjQIHfBeCpMQ6AEINzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=fossil%20%22sodium%20bicarbonate%22%20dolomite&amp;f=false) on the subject.",

From a basic understanding of evolution, major things that help adaptation and survival might continue on to offspring, give them the same advantages, etc.  But does something like this serrated tooth really give the T-Rex an advantage enough over other dinosaurs?  Or, is it just a mutation that got lumped in with all the other things that comprise a \"T-Rex\"?  Did the T-Rex evolve long enough (clearly it did?) for this type of feature to stick as an advantage over other T-Rexes that didn't have it?  I'm rambling but I hope you get the gist of what I'm asking.",

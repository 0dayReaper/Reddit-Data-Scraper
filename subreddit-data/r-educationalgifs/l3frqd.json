Tracks claims filed by veterans for benefits, eligibility, and dates of death. This system is a suite of COBOL mainframe applications.\n\nThe government tends to overpay so it's smart to buy things that don't break down easily as it reduces government waste, time to repair, and in some cases is necessary to that certain things keep running. Also some of those mainframes being so old might offer defense since the systems aren't commonly used\n\nHowever, in other cases they should opt to refresh their technology, which old systems are susceptible to exploitation, where old systems like COBOL might offer added security since newer hackers might not be as familiar with it yet also are an issue because the of lack of encryption, and plan which things should be in line for replacement\n\n&gt;What branch do you work for, btw?\n\nI don't know about him, but in case you want to know I work for the internal revenue branch as a special contractor. Special in that it's like one of those new internships where you have to pay to work at the firm except I work offsite.",

I use a 5G everyday these days, mostly due to it having a 40hour battery life and 512GB worth of storage)\n\nedit: and if you ever need a repair guide, check out dankpods on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S83ZHf1GAeY\n\ndouble edit: you can just use this for the third gen: https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-ata1/",

The rotational velocity depends entirely on how far from the center the laser head is reading: unlike vynil, which is constant speed, a CD (and all similar technologies like DVD and bluray) are constant density of information. As such the rotational velocity changes to keep the linear velocity of the disc under the laser head constant.\n\nSo, if it's actually playing something, it's actually accelerating/decelerating slightly all the time.",

                    "comment": "Here's a sort of informal and intuitive explanation:\n\nImagine you have a ping pong ball floating in water and you blow some air on it with a straw - It would be very easy to make it go where you want to, since even a relatively small force, like air from a straw, can result in a large change in direction.\n\nNow imagine someone flicks the ping pong ball and it's skidding across the surface at full speed. If you try the same thing now, you might deflect it slightly, but it's still going to be skidding in roughly the same direction and you aren't going to be very successful. In other words, **it's harder to change the direction of an objects motion, if the object is moving faster.**\n\nWe can formalize this with the idea of [vectors](https://mathinsight.org/vector_introduction#:~:text=Definition%20of%20a%20vector,its%20tail%20to%20its%20head.). Momentum (or linear momentum) is a vector quantity that describes an object's mass, speed, and direction of motion. And changing the direction of a larger vector is harder than a smaller vector.\n\nHere's the important part: **Angular momentum is also a vector.** Angular momentum describes how much something is spinning AND the direction of its spin. It turns out this can be described perfectly with vectors.\n\nRelating back to our ping pong ball example, a discman that is turned off is an object with a small angular momentum, and therefore it's easier to change its direction of rotation with a small \"force\". A discman that is turned on is an object with a large angular momentum and therefore it's harder to change its direction of rotation.\n\nI'm abusing some terminology and skipping some technical details that aren't instructive, but I hope the main idea is clear.",

It's the same as when people say zero gravity or zero-G.\n\nPersonally, I don't like the term nor do I like \"zero gravity.\" These astronauts still experience something like 80% the force of gravity of the Earth that we on the surface do, they're just continuously in freefall. Thus, microgravity and zero-gravity are both wrong if interpreted literally. Zero-G or micro-G are more accurate because G is the gravitational acceleration they're feeling normalized to the \\~9.81 m/s^(2) we feel on the surface of the Earth. In a perfectly circular orbit they'd get exactly 0 G, but due to perturbations and the likes they probably vary by very small amounts with respect to the ISS's body.",

Computers that do not receive this update **will be removed** from the domain and require hands-on intervention to be re-added.\n\n&gt; (insert the rest of the email here)\n\n\nThis would be followed by the longer email, for example explaining why we can't update it remotely (because it *is* the software we use to push updates, and it's broken as shit), how to perform the update (literally just run the script we dropped on your desktop that some upper manager decided we couldn't just put in your startup folder or remotely execute because muh policies), why we're removing computers that fail to update (because they're failing to receive security patches and becoming increasingly vulnerable points on the network), and how much downtime can be expected for any computers that get kicked off the domain (days or perhaps weeks, we literally have 2 dudes who do that job full-time, and hundreds of computers are gonna get dropped).  But all the user needs to know upfront is that they must update it by a certain date, or their computer's getting yeeted from the network.",

They're also highly transportable, so you can give everyone in a squad a small roll of sandbags and everyone is always carrying an e-tool and voila- you have a semi-reinforced firing position in short order anywhere you stop long enough to fill and place them.\n\nA full-fledged fighting hole (or the field-expedient \"Ranger graves\") doesn't even need the bags.  A few hours of digging and the displaced earth itself gets tamped down in front and to the sides of the fighting hole to form a barrier from incoming fire.",

The problem is that it LOOKS like we have tons of sand on the planet but deserts are so windy that the constant friction rounds out the individual flakes to the point where they can\u2019t sit on top of another anymore.\nTo get proper sand that has structural integrity, it must thus be taken from the sea. In a lot of places it\u2019s actually even illegal to just get sand from a beach or anywhere near it so less regulated countries make a great profit on secretly destroying the earth and whole ecosystems by collecting vast amounts of sand to import for rich countries on fake documentation. It\u2019s crazy cause nobody thinks about sand but this is a major topic when we\u2019re looking at what\u2019s killing the planet.",

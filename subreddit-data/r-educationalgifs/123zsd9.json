So even in the most generous way possible those representations are about 7000x bigger in scale than reality.  Not trying to diminish the negative effect of space junk, just trying to point out how ludicrous those animations are.",

It would be a great start for space force &amp; reason to fly near enemy satellites to get intelligence - we're just sweeping up here nothing to see, lol",

Adding fuel means additional weight which means less payload weight can be launched which makes everything more expensive.\n\nEverything that's tracked is not a danger. The ISS makes adjustments to it's orbit quite often to avoid tracked space debris. New satellites either de-orbit themselves at end of mission or go into a graveyard orbit so they are not a threat to other satellites/astronauts. Regarding the spycraft, no space vehicle has the ability to capture a satellite and safely return it to Earth. It's really not a concern. The space shuttle theoretically could do that but they never even tested it. It's easier to steal that technology on the ground than it is in space.",

Out of those objects in orbit, roughly 5000 are known satellites (in the communications sense of the word), of which maybe 2000-3000 are functioning last time I looked into this. \n\nStarlink, Project Kuiper, and several other groups are planning on sending thousands more up there. Starlink alone is planning on around 12,000 for its [satellite constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_constellation). The reflectivity of these low Earth orbit satellites is already posing a problem for astronomy.\n\nGiven our signal processing tricks and advances in optics, we can probably handle that thorn in our side. But take a guess what happens if these objects collide, due to either mishap or foul play? Shrapnel. Perhaps a cascade of shrapnel, as collisions link together. This enters a possible scenario known as [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome), where we essentially blanket the atmosphere with a flak dome threatening the future of interstellar communication.",

On Amazon you'll see some really nice sets, but they all cost around $300 because they come with a board.\n\nGiven the crazy  amount of money people spend on other hobbies a few hundred once in your life is really not that much.",

I don't imagine any other similarly priced sets aren't, I genuinely can't find any.\n\nMaybe I'm just fussy but I'd rather play with a plastic set that has nicely moulded pieces that the boxy knight atrocities that are cheap wooden sets.\n\nI do get your point that other hobbies like fly fishing *need* quality tools.\n\nAll I'm saying is that this does affect people's enjoyment of the game.",

You can even see the secondary magnetic field line that disrupted the main flair causing it to eject.\n\nNear the surface of the sun, left side of the flair. It's much smaller than the main magnetic loop but still large enough to disrupt it causing the main loop to flair off and eject.",

If it had struck nine days earlier then we would have been subjected to it.\n\n\"The solar storm of 2012 was an unusually large and strong coronal mass ejection (CME) event that occurred on July 23 that year. It missed Earth with a margin of approximately nine days. The region that produced the outburst was thus not pointed directly towards Earth at that time. The strength of the eruption was comparable to the 1859 Carrington Event that caused damage to electrical equipment worldwide, which at that time consisted mostly of telegraph systems.\"",

Magma being the stuff underground, lava being the stuff above ground. \n\n(Fun fact - if lava get ejected into space from an eruption or a meteor impact it's called \"ejecta\". So lava in space is called \"ejecta\"). \n\nThere is no lava on the sun because stuff there is too hot to be anything other than basic elements like hydrogen or helium, stuff like that. \n\nThe stuff you are seeing from the sun is more elemental than physical. The physics gets weird when you are dealing something so huge like the sun. The arc you are seeing is the twisting and bending of the sun's magnetic field. The stuff it's made up of is mostly protons and neutrons. Element wise it's helium and similar materials, but it's not like rocks or anything remotely close to actual matter like lava. \n\nOccasionally there's enough of a fluctuation in the sun's field that one of these filaments is ejected from the sun, shoved out into space like a giant sun fart. \n\nThe majority of these go off in random directions. Occasionally, they hit us. They don't pose any direct danger to humans, but indirectly they can hurt our electronics as they can energize the air around us and cause devices, satellites, and electrical wires to overload with too much electricity at once.",

The way I visualize it is a giant rubber band or slingshot that's been pulled all the way back, and then twisted around and around. At some point you hand slips or something comes undone, and the rubber band untwists and then snaps back to it's original shape. \n\nThat's kind of whats happening on the sun. Magnetic fields loop around like rubber bands, but the gravity and heat of the sun sometimes twists and pulls them way out of shape, until something happens within the sun to cause the field to \"snap back\" to it's original form. That snapping back action is what propels particals. Most of the time they go up along the field line and fall back down, called a solar \"prominence.\" But sometimes the energy involved is so strong a portion of the magnetic field is ejected into space.",

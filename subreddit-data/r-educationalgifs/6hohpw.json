However, some dogs' bodies, for no reason in particular, don't do that properly. So the filled glands become uncomfortable and dogs will do a variety of things to try and relieve the discomfort (licking, scooting, intent sniffing, squatting but nothing comes out). The majority of dogs go their whole lives without needing assistance, but some do (my mutt) and a vet can do it alongside a checkup",

The average speed of a canter is 16\u201327 km/h (10\u201317 mph), depending on the length of the stride of the horse. Listening to a horse canter, one can usually hear the three beats as though a drum had been struck three times in succession. Then there is a rest, and immediately afterwards the three-beat occurs again. The faster the horse is moving, the longer the suspension time between the three beats.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.21",

I thought that cats and camels had a different gait cycle (and not just that they step in their own foot-prints) than other quadrupeds, but all the videos I'm finding show they're pretty much the same. Or am I missing something?\n\nAlso, gif is dead-on, and I said FL BL FR BR, which is also wrong.\n\nVideos:\n\n[Dog Slow Motion; Walk, Amble, Pace, Trot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqBcBsmMQVA)\n\n[Cat Slow Motion; Walking ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzt18V3Uaxc&amp;t=20)\n\n[Cat; Walking, Trotting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaYXX-68jSM)\n\n[Camel Slow Motion; Walking](https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-1067425-stock-footage-camel-walking-slow-motion.html)",

Unless the dog is running, all of their walking motions are cross connected like humans when we step forward with our left foot, but have our right hand out forward, for example.  This has more to do with balance, and is more important when there are 4 points of weight as opposed to human's two.  It's just hard to see because their legs are much smaller.\n\nsource: knows how to use youtube... and dog owner.",

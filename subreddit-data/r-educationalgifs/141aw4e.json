This sexual transformation is known as epitoky: atokous (juvenile) polychaetes transform and become epitokous (sexually mature). Epitoky prepares the worms for a brief pelagic existence and improves the chances that sexual partners will find each other. During epitoky, some species of polychaetes will \"explode\" or rapidly disintegrate to release their eggs and sperm (gametes). https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/9013/1/Bachelorscriptie\\_Pablo\\_de\\_Vries.pdf\r  \n\r  \nVideo footage from Cozumel, Mexico: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNqcWQHEOog",

The original entity is asexual, but it will grow little modified clones of itself to swim around looking for prospective clone partners to explode at. Meanwhile, the original organism carries on doing its own thing.\n\nSo, at a certain point it becomes a philosophical question. Do you consider the entity to be its own creature, or just a convoluted gamete delivery mechanism? When that one species of octopus throws its detachable penis arm at females, is the arm dying? It's swimming around with some level of agency, as each arm has its own sort of brain.\n\nAlso, going back to the schizogamy thing, some of them don't involve creating a \"mini me\" that looks similar to the original organism. Maybe just a section of their rear end will pop off, grow an eye, and swim to the mating area. But that sounds a lot like a tapeworm shedding a segment of itself to deliver eggs everywhere, if with more involved steps.",

Some produce sexually, some asexually, some have the choice of doing both. Some \"spawn\" gametes with only half of their genetic code, while others are hermaphroditic and produce their own not-quite clones if they can't find a fresh genetic donor. Whether this worm is creating fully functioning worm larvae or just a cloud of half-RNA gametes I don't know for sure.",

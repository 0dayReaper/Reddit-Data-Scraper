While it may make a mess, your oven is designed to withstand 1000\u00b0F(reedom units) and can simultaneously contain the fire while choking out the oxygen.\n  \nOnce you place it in there, you should leave the oven closed until it has FULLY cooled off. The safety locks usually have a thermocouple in there that prevents them from being opened until it has cooled to a safe temperature",

And oil floats on top of water.\n\nSo when you throw water onto a grease fire, the water sinks below the oil and is flash-boiled to steam by the intense heat, which blows the oil out like a small explosion. This causes the oil to break into thousands of tiny droplets. All those droplets have a lot more surface area than the original pool of oil, allowing the oil to mix with oxygen at a greatly-increased rate, which speeds up the combustion of the oil so much that it transitions from \"on fire\" to \"exploding\" (this is the same general reason why a pile of sawdust is perfectly safe, and you could put a cigarette out in it, but a large cloud of sawdust in the air is an explosion hazard).\n\nSo the end result of throwing water on oil is a giant fireball of flaming oil droplets that will probably set your house on fire.",

You take a metal coffee can like what Folgers used to come in, punch a hole in the bottom about an inch in diameter, stick a rubber tube into the hole and tape it in place. The tube should go about an inch into the can and should be about 2 feet long. Then you fill the coffee can 3/4 full with flour and stick a bunch of birthday candles in it. The bigger white wax candles work better if you have them. Try to light the flour itself with a lighter and nothing happens. It just puts it out. Now light the candles, lift the can up over your head and away from your face (obviously do this outside), and blow into the tube as hard as you can. A huge fireball will shoot into the air. If you have kids, I highly recommend showing them this because 10 year old me thought it was fucking awesome. The camp counselor prefaced it with a story about how he heard about a bakery that had burned down in a terrible fire and couldn\u2019t fire out what was so flammable in a bakery. I remember another demonstration that night. They took a bag glass milk jug with a small opening/spout at the top (probably a little more that an inch). The counselor took a peeled hard boiled egg and said he was going to put the egg into the jar without touch it. He put a piece of newspaper in the spout, lit it on fire, and pushed it down into the jar. Then he placed the egg over the opening. The fire created a vacuum and sucked the egg into the jar. That camp was fucking awesome. The good ol\u2019 days when you could shoot a bow and arrow, dissect animals, and blow shit up at camp.",

The small oil droplets burn in the air. There\u2019s more burnable surface area on the fountain of oil drops in the air than there is on the pre-water surface of the pot, so the fountain burns like a motherfucker!",

(We were between the ages of 18-20 at the time.) \n\nShe was frying pork chops are something and then I hear her call for my help. I casually walk over to the kitchen and see about a small fire burning on the stove. \n\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d I think to myself. \u201cWe need to smother this.\u201d I start looking for a pot lid or something to cover up the pan. \n\nWell as I\u2019m failing my investigation check, my sister has filled a small Tupperware container with water. The next moment happens in the slow motion for me. I watch with pure terror as her extends her arm and flicks the contents of the container onto the fire.  You guessed it folks, the above gif is precisely what happened to my father\u2019s kitchen. \n\nI vividly remember standing and staring as the flames began to climb up the walls and across the ceiling. I honestly don\u2019t know how or why the flames just abruptly stopped burning but they did. Thankfully no one was hurt. \n\nMy sister learned a valuable lesson that day about oil, water and grease fires. And we also learned that Mr.Clean magic erasers do a fairly good job of cleaning up the charred evidence of our fuck up as we proceeded to scrub down the kitchen walls. \n\nTL;DR - My sister is no chemist and set fire to my dad\u2019s kitchen via this method.

                    "comment": "Store time! \nSomething similar happened to my sister and I. I was 16 she was 18. She wanted to make donuts while my dad and stepmom were on a motorcycle day trip. She printed off a recipe from the internet (this was before everyone had a computer in their pockets) and made the batter. The recipe called for a pot of oil on the stove with no further instructions other than to place formed batter into oil.\nAll is going well, we\u2019re getting along laughing and getting our hands dirty with chocolate batter. She forms the first donut and drops it in the oil. \nBOOM EXPLOSION! \nThe batter must have been too wet, oil too hot, and/or dropped in too aggressively. \nWe were both blown back. She screamed WATER!!\nI grabbed a bowl, filled it at the sink, and threw the bowl of water at the fire. \nBOOM BIGGER EXPLOSION!!!\nShe was blown into the corner of the kitchen and tried to get out the sliding window. Just little chocolate hand prints from her desperately trying to get out. I was blown toward the dining room, near the back door. The phone was on the wall near her and the flames in the kitchen, so I ran outside just screaming fire. She ended up getting out and we stared at our fathers pride and joy home in horror. \nA neighbor must have heard and called 911. All of a sudden there were 5+ fire engines and 3+ police cruisers blocking off our home on the main road. \nSwitch to my fathers point of view- he\u2019s coming home from a lovely full day of scenic motorcycle trip with stepmom. He pulls onto our main road and is stopped by a police officer saying he can\u2019t pass through. My dad takes a closer look and yells THATS MY HOUSE!! He speeds past the officer and into his driveway. \nBack to me- My sis and I are standing in the driveway watching the firemen take care of the situation. Luckily it was under control and at this point they\u2019re just checking the entire house for hot spots etc. \nI hear a motorcycle engine. FUCK. My dad runs over, hugs us, and asks if we\u2019re okay. We were nervous crying/laughing, terrified. My stepmom goes \u201cyou think this is funny\u201d? No bitch I almost died, my eyebrows are gone. I\u2019m scared. \nCut to fire chief walking out the door near the kitchen holding these giant metal tongs and grasped in them is a teeny tiny charred pebble. He goes to us \u201cis this what you were trying to cook\u201d? \nWe looked up at him and said \u201cwe wanted to make donuts\u201d \ud83d\ude33\nMy dad- calmest man alive, so loving. Had a look on his face I\u2019ve never seen before. I still don\u2019t think I can compute it. He handed us a $10 and said eerily calmly \u201cDunkin Donuts is down the road. Go. Now.\u201d\n\nTL;DR My sister and I had great educations and decent upbringing. NEVER taught not to throw fire on a grease fire. Blew our dads house up trying to make donuts. Sent off to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts so my dad could deal. \nPS my dog is named Dunkin\u2019 ",

You can also use baking soda or salt, but never ever use flour!\n\nAll you need to do is smother the flame and not allow any more oxygen to come into contact with it. Some people suggested a damp cloth (it needs to be big enough to cover the entire surface) or as the fire department told you, just put a lid on it. Oxygen is what allows fires to burn, so depriving it of that makes the fire go away. Also if you can, turn off the stove and move the pan off the heat. ",

            "comment": "I did this once when I was younger. I stayed home from and my parents were working (my grandma lived with us but she had dimentia and was old so pretty much home alone. I poured gasoline in a coffee cup and set it on fire in my garage. Don't ask me why because I literally don't know and assume it was because I liked fire. Once it got big I got nervous. I put it in a cooler before lighting it and that started to burn so I took a big glass of water and threw it on it.\n\nThen my whole garage caught on fire. I called my mom sobbing because I was about to burn the house down. I was in such panic I couldn't even speak. I eventually told her and she called my neighbor and then I called the fire department. I eventually opened the  garage door to filter the smoke out and the weirdest shit happened. My  grandma couldn't get out of the house bexause she was terrifed and it was just a mess. A random guy driving past  stopped, ran up and asked, \"how many people/pets in the house?\" I said my grandma who was by the door and he ran and picked her up and carried her out to our front yard and just left. Anyways, once the fire department came I realized i overstated the fire because they shut down the entire road (we live on a bit of a busy road). 3 fire trucks came and at this point the fire was just burning a bit of the walls. Most of the fire was on the cement so it wasn't about to burn our house down or anything.\n\nOnce they got it under control, my mom got home from work and they were doing the \"cause of fire\" report. Me being nervous of getting in trouble, said, \"I put popcorn kernels in the microwave and it started sparking so I threw it in the garage and it caught on fire\". The fire fighters just went with it and then talked to my mom and said, \"please make sure he doesn't play with gasoline again\"\n\nSo yeah, water and gasoline doesn't mix.",

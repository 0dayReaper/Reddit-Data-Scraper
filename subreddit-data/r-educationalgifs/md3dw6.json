People and animals originally ate just the fruit of the pod and discarded the seeds inside.\n\nNow, we obviously can\u2019t know for sure how we made the leap to fermentation and roasting, but there are a couple of not so outlandish theories.\n\nOne idea is that often times piles of the discarded seeds would just be left out and would naturally ferment. Somebody eventually tried roasting those fermented seeds and discovered you could then eat them.\n\nAnother idea is that people who ate the seeds discovered their psychoactive properties and just tried a bunch of different ways to make the substance more palatable or potent.",

Mesoamerican chocolate was a bitter, sometimes savory drink that was often reserved for the wealthy or for special occasions. The seeds were even used as currency in some places. When consumed, it was used almost like a premium coffee, offering liquid energy in the form of a very foamy brew. It wouldn't take too much work to figure out this method of chocolate. Fermentation can happen by accident if you simply store fruit for too long, and it would make sense for a hungry person to try cooking and eating the seeds after finishing the fruit itself. \n\nEarly European explorers and missionaries disliked the prized beverage, often turning it down to the amusement (and presumably insult) of natives. When it was eventually exported, it only caught on after Europeans started adding milk and/or sugar. Then, BLAM, modern chocolate takes the world by storm.\n\nEdit: it was natural for the Europeans to try adding cream and sugar to the mix. They had been doing it with tea; and the wealthy Europeans, who would have been experimenting with this exotic import, loved to make everything decadent as all hell.\n\nEdit 2: typos",

There is usually a separation stage where cocoa butter and cocoa solids are removed and then reincorporated in specific ratios later. In this method, the cocoa butter isn't driven out and separated but rather incorporated and emulsified to create the chocolate mix directly, this is a fantastic method that truly highlights the characteristics of that variety of cocoa bean and it's growing conditions, similar to single origin varieties of coffee.",

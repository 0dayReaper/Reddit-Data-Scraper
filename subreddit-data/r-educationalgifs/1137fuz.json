I remember that the KC-10s had to use less pumps with our jet because of our setup (boom versus drogue)\n\nA tanker actually almost brought down one of our jets because of fuel flow rates. Our jet (707 airframe type)  airplane had Depot maintenance and they accidentally left a vent air plug in the wing. When fuel goes in, this vent balances the air.  The vent was plugged.\n\nThe jet flew all the way from the US to Qatar using kc-135 tankers.  On a Mission over Iraq , it caught up with the Kc-10 tanker. The tanker pumped gas at such a rate that the air couldn\u2019t escape and rupture one of the main inboard fuel tanks. The boom operated saw the wing pissing fuel out the back. \n\nThe jet rtb\u2019d and never flew again.  $300 million static display in the desert.",

Similar airframes KC-10 on KC-10 match up fairly smoothly due to the stream and is honestly pretty easy with steady hands. KC-10 receiving from a KC-135 is much harder as the stream pushes you down and out. The current mod on the 135 doesn't allow for autopilot to be utilized which means you are entirely dependent on the hands of the 135 pilot... This affects all airframes. Drogue refueling is entirely on the receiver (video you're watching). Good pilots make contacts slow and smooth while others go for the ol' thrust and jab method.",

Some bonds are stronger and produce a tighter molecule than others.   \n\nIt's like having a box filled with one kind of ball.  If it's basket balls, atoms with a weak confinment, you can fit less in the given space.  But if they are golf balls,atoms with strong confinment, you can fit more.\n\nImpure substances are made of various sizes and shapes of molecules, meaning you can fit even less into the space, making a weaker, but more interesting, material overall.  This is very noticeable in things like iron where the impure layers oxidize and flake off.  Where a pure iron ingot will turn to dust over a significantly longer period of time, without flaking.\n\nA cool way humans have over come this is by forging, where we heat the materials to break the bonds of the impurities and literally hammer them out.  Check out a video of a katana being made for more information.",

They had a wind tunnel that ran 60% scale model cars and could turn 30 degrees in each direction. The data collected in the wind tunnel was ran through a supercomputer on site to figure out placement of the tungsten and best aerodynamic setup of the car body. It was pretty impressive.",

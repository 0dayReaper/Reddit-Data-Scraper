The video cycles trough every day of the year when it is 0:00 in london. You see in December or January the night in the northern hemisphere is a lot longer than in the southern hemisphere and the other was around in june. Many people just overlook the fact that there is 0:00GMT so they make dumb comments like: \u201eso in Australia it\u2019s always day?\u201c this is a simple graph and it\u2019s quite embarrassing that so many ppl can\u2019t comprehend this.

It doesn\u2019t matter that California doesn\u2019t get \u201ctouched\u201d by the coloured portion.

Okay, also what does white mean? How many hours is that? And isn't night length counted per day/full rotation? Why is there a 0 gmt?",

The graph shows the area where it is night cycling through the year while its always 0:00. think of it like a snapshot of the whole earth everytime it is 0:00 in London. You see when it\u2019s January the northern half of the earth has a longer night and when it is june the southern hemisphere has more night. This is a simple graph and i can\u2019t believe that so many people seemingly adults to don\u2019t get this. Sorry for bad English i live in switzerland",

I assume this is what OP was thinking with that wording in the title, which unfortunately made it easier for people to miss the 0:00 GMT thing.",

For any day if the year, as asserted by this figure, there is singular day-length value for each latitude. The length along the x-axis (over longitude, really) of the colored areas and the colors themselves are redundant representations; there is one 2d graph of that you can construct for each day of latitude versus day length. These appear to be truncated beta distributions to me. As such, you could represent the entire animated history with one 2d colorized x-y plot where the x-value corresponds to calendar day and the y-locations are colored by day length.\n\nEdit: But also it's inaccurate. The length of day/night is slighty shorter/longer as you move eastward on any particular day.",

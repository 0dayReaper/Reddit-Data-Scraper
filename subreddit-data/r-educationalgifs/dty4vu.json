From there you can choose which tab at the top you want something from, and hit that letter. Then every option in that tab will have a letter, and after that their drop-down menus if they have one. \n\nFor example the data tab is \"A\" and the button to sort A&gt;Z is \"SA\" once you get into the data tab. So ALT \"ASA\" will sort for you. \n\nThe main tab is \"H\", the column options are \"O\" and auto column width under that is \"I\". So ALT \"HOI\" auto adjusts column width for columns you have selected. \n\n\nIt's really fun to do once you get used to it and have memorized some that you use a lot. And you look really smart if someone who is watching has no idea what you're doing.",

If, for example, you need to append existing content in a cell and you have 50 lines to go through but only every third  line has text in it, it can be very time consuming to take your hand off the keyboard, grab the mouse, hover over the right cell, double click it, then bring your hand back over to the keyboard and start typing. Instead, you can type Ctrl+D+down arrow to skip to the next non-blank cell, and then F2 to open the cell to start typing in it.",

Also, if you have 2 monitors but want to a third app on one monitor with both Excel files on other, on the screen you want both Excel files hold the Windows key down, hit the left arrow, snaps the first file to half that monitor, do the same on the other (both have to be on the same monitor) hold the Windows key down then tap the right arrow, and the other file will snap to the other half of that screen without going to the other monitor.  Do this a lot when working with 2 Excel files on 1 screen and SAP on the other.\n\nEdit:  It's also nice to have 2 21\" monitors",

You can select it all, click to create pivot table, drag salesmen to rows, date to columns, amount to values, then group dates by months, and just like that you created sales report by salesmen, then you can add category to filters, and switch between total sales and specific category. It automatically calculates totals and subtotals too. Whenever you have new data, you just append it to original data and click refresh on pivot, and it's up to date.\n\nYou can have multiple pivot tables for the same data, so you can have one report by salesmen, the other one by product, one very detailed, and the other that is just brief summary. They are very easy to modify by just dragging fields where you want them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made a quick example: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/09c7e96pngof2iu/Pivot.xlsx?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/09c7e96pngof2iu/Pivot.xlsx?dl=1)",

Likewise, if you find that you're relying on a vlookup to more than a couple other locations, use a data-oriented scripting language rather than excel. Don't reproduce a rdbm in excel (please).\n\nIf you are going to vba in this day and age, strongly consider using an alternative scripting language with more robust data preservation, debugging, and object-oriented (inheritance!?) features. honestly, it's worth learning python and r before implementing a new vba system.",

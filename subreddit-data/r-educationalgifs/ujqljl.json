To me, the most astounding thing is that prior to the cable, the fastest ships (and therefore information) could cross the Atlantic was in a little over a week. So when that telegraph station was turned on in 1858, we went from it taking 7+ days to receive to near instantaneous.\n\nImagine it taking a week+ for your country to find out about a major military defeat, or the death of a monarch. Then suddenly that information could be obtained in the blink of an eye. That must\u2019ve been astonishing to experience.\n\nEDIT: all the interesting replies prompted me to [pose the question in AskHistorians](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ujtzyk/the_first_transatlantic_communication_cable_was/) for those interested in learning more.",

It takes anywhere from 8 to 24 hours for a repair.\n\nIf a cable is cut, they use a grappling hook or ROV arm to snag it and recover it.  If it's not a total cut, they use a grappling hook with a cutting attachment to cut the cable, then switch back to the grabber attachment and recover it.\n\nThey'll bring one end up on board, cut back a length of cable as water will have ingressed, seal it off with a water tight end cap, attach a rope to a floating buoy and then throw it overboard so they can recover it later.\n\nThen they go recover the other end of the cable, cut back some length, then splice on a section of spare cable that the ship has on-hand or picked up at the cable owner's supply depot, then they test that splice.\n\nThe splices are typically done with a [universal joint ](https://i.imgur.com/SEZ0niS.jpg) which is put in a hot mold injection machine (polyurethane I think) to make it water tight.  The mold is x-rayed to ensure no bubbles that would compromise it in the high water pressure.\n\nThen they sail to the buoy, recover that end of the cable, splice that onto the spare section of cable.  Same process with another universal joint.  Then staff at the cable stations on either end test it end to end multiple times: once the initial splice is done, then after the hot injection molding, then one last time when the ship has the cable in the water on a rope before they cut it and let it fall to the seabed.  They will lay the cable in a U shape, so it doesn't have a tight bend raidus, and it will be twice the water depth in length laid perpendicular to the cable direction.\n\nAfter all that, service is restored and the ship is off to the next repair.",

If the traffic is routed to a network over seas, it eventually hits a PoP that routes it to the trunk that spans the ocean where it comes into another PoP over there and is transited through possibly many more peers until it gets where it is going. These routes are all broadcasted using a protocol call Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), by each network, which assigns weights to various routes to reduce either the number of hops or the cost. By cost, I mean there are peering arrangements between transit networks, some are settlement free, meaning its a \"Ill scratch your back if you scratch mine\" type scenario, but other arrangements charge  a fee for a set amount of tonnage. Sometimes the route being weighed may favor a few more hops if it means they can reduce transit on the settlement. Settlement costs are usually set with an agreed total amount of traffic, ie: they charge X amount if the provider uses Y amount of bandwidth 95% of the time, the other 5% is basically a grace zone (p95), so if they are reaching the limit, they will reweigh routes and broadcast them to avoid penalties.",

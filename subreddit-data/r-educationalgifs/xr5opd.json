I mean they kind of are in that they prevent water from flowing one direction to the other, but backflow is very common in check valves during the flow transition from one direction to another.\n\nTo prevent cross contamination you use a backflow preventer (or BFP), which is basically a couple of check valves in series with a pressure relief valve. Other names for it are RPDA (Reduced Pressure Detector Assembly), DCDA (Double Check  Detector Assembly), RPZA (Reduced Pressure Zone Assembly),  DCVA (Double Check Valve Assembly).\n\nThey're all slightly different things to achieve different goals. Oh, and usually a vacuum breaker (VB) is used to achieve backflow prevention near outlets as well.",

In our line of work we deal with check valves that are similar to what is shown in the diagram, but much much bigger.  Most  of our valves range in size from 4 inches in diameter up to 36 inches in diameter.  Typically you have a check valve with either an internal return spring, or an external weight and lever return with a spring assist.   In an underground buried application, we'd use an internal spring assist check valve, whereas on pipe gallery installations where the valve is out in the open, we'd use an external spring and lever or a weighted spring and lever (depending on the size of the valve.)  \nThe check valve you referenced in your photo would typically be used in smaller high pressure lines.  I have a classic car at home in the garage, and the fuel lines have a check valve similar to what you posted to prevent the fuel from flowing backwards to the pump.",

The way the ram pump works depends on the water accelerating a little while the valve is open and then slamming shut. If there is a spring in the valve then the valve will just stay shut and the water never gets the opportunity to move.",

The use case is a balancing act of how important back flow is vs the cost of said valve. In extremely large lines, like ones you could fit a person through large, you'll almost always see swing checks as they are going to be more economical and usually in those lines a bit of back flow isn't going to be the end of the world. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge reliability isn't really a factor because it's more about the sealing surface than the mechanism. In certain applications that it's imperative to have zero backflow I've had clients require two check valves with different tech in line with each other to  make sure that if one fails the other won't during certain \"upset\" conditions. \n\nBut one thing that wasn't addressed here is the ram pump I haven't heard of those before so looked into it a bit I think swing checks are used there because they work really well at low pressure applications. You'd have to have a fairly soft spring on the other types of check valves for it to work. I really liked this video if you haven't already seen it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFdyqTGx32A",

It could potentially travel through the gutter system and flood the streets.  So you put a check valve on the discharge and it prevents this from happening.",

You *can* partially open a ball valve, but the flow is very turbulent and hard to meter accurately, especially near the fully closed position.\n\nAlso, valves will not be affected by the pressure of the fluid unless the pressure is wildly out of control. The valve should maintain its position regardless of flow or else it would be completely useless.",

There are scenarios where you want one, two, or even all three of them in series on the same pipe.\n\n- Check valves are used for one way flow. Flow is caused by a difference in pressure. On the right side, the pressure is lower for all three of these valves in the graphic. If the pressure were lower on the left, this check valve gate would close due to the increased pressure on it from the right side.\n\n- Ball valves are used mostly for isolation (stopping flow in both directions), and they have very little pressure drop across them (less work to pump through). They are very simple, usually it's open and close. Technically you can use them to throttle flow rate but it's not ideal.\n\n- Globe valves are mostly used for throttling flow rate. They are more precise than Ball valves and you can control flow rate through them based on how far up the plug is lifted from the seat (by rotating the handle). However they have a higher pressure drop than Ball valves (more work to pump through).",

I design water and waste water treatment plants for a living, and typically utilize all of these different types of valves in our applications.    Gate valves are good, up to a certain size (10 inches typically) or back pressure before they get too hard to open due to the force of liquid pushing against the gate plate.  Once we cross over a certain size, a butterfly valve makes the most sense.",

            "comment": "Valves are interesting asf. I was a chemical plant operator for years and loved talking to the mechanics and engineers about stuff I didn\u2019t know. \n\nFor those asking, check valves are typically used in discharge applications. I.E. places where you only really want the liquid/fluid you are pumping to go one direction, from an industrial standpoint you would mostly see these on the discharges of pumps to prevent backflow into standby pumps or pipes that return to the suction. Also check valves are notoriously unreliable and in many cases fail or are bad at performing their intended purpose which is why the are usually used in conjunction with some kind of block valve. \n\nFor ball valves, like other quarter-turn valves (Butterfly and plug valves) they are usually used for on-off application as the design of these valves are not ideal at throttling/controlling flow/pressure. Typically when talking about solenoid valves, these are the kind of valve mechanisms that are used. Open or close is usually how you will see these valves and typically you will see them used on smaller systems as such as in plumbing opposed to on a large industrial scale (that\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t used but typically you won\u2019t see many of them on higher pressure applications such as steam or header piping) because they are also unreliable, not to the extent of check valves but they will fail more often than the next valves in the list.\n\nAs for globe valves, like other valves used for regulating (such as gate valves and needle valves) they are relatively robust when compared to the other two types of valves. Because of their design they are widely used in process industry not only because they are harder to break and will last longer but also because they are good at restricting/regulating the flow and pressure of the fluids they are piped into. In many cases they are used as control valves (which are typically remotely operated or self operated from some control center) that can be operated by pneumatics, hydraulics, or motors. These valves use control schemes to look at different process variables such as temperature, pressure, flow or level to adjust how far open/closed they need to be to achieve a desired set point. In my experience gate valves are more common in refineries and chemical plants where I\u2019m from but this probably differs from place to place.",

The screw gives the operator mechanical advantage to control the valve even in large pipes. In many of the screw-activated valves, like the globe illustrated here, the mechanism moves perpendicular to the flow which also reduces the forces acting directly against the operator.",

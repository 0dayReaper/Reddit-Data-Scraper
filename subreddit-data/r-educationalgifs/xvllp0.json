This animation is actually from a perspective within the ring geostationary orbit forms, because we'd see it crossing the equator on the visible side of the planet if we were out far enough.",

This is shown by keplar's laws of orbital mechanics. \n\nHowever, not all orbits have the same direction or inclination as you stated. Some satellites are moving east to west, some are moving north or south, or even north-east to south- east, etc etc. \n\nBecause they're moving in different directions and overlap the same \"altitude\" there are possibilities for a satellites to impact each other at relative speeds slower or faster than the stated 7500 m/s. It depends on what hits what at what angle.\n\nA satellite can T-bone another satellite moving perpendicular to it, and it would be similar to it hitting a stationary object (according to it's own velocity vector, it's actually worse because they are actually hitting each according to their respective velocity vectors).\n\nLong way to say, high speed impacts is a very real thing, especially in LEO. Unfortunately, it's kind of common. [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_collision) is a list of documented times it's happened. The most recent one was in 2021.",

I think my point is that posts like this one tend to get people into a reactionary state about \u201call of the junk\u201d in space.\n\nI\u2019ve even seen heavily upvotes comments say things like we are going to trapped here if we don\u2019t make hasty action and stop launching satellites. This is hogwash, but it seems to be becoming a common concern.\n\nThe article you mentioned has 5 unintended collisions listed unless I am reading it wrong, so I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call it \u201ccommon\u201d. Does it happen? Clearly, it has and it will, and it is catastrophic when it does occur, but the reality of how we orbit satellites means that we are much more likely to catch an impact with a micro-meteorite than we are to collide with a satellite that humans put into orbit.\n\nBasically, all I\u2019m saying is that beyond space being way bigger than this gif makes it out to be, it also has rules and those rules tend to have things behaving in similar ways when they are near each other in orbit.",

However, there are actually many objects smaller then 10cm or even smaller then 1cm. Still, a 1cm shrapnel impacting your space station/satellite/space craft  releases the energy of an exploding hand grenade. Such tiny and fast objects are tricky to detect or evade but can have very dangerous consequences.... Now for the massive pieces (meters in diameter) everything gets much worse.\n\nMore details: https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris/ESA_s_Space_Environment_Report_2022\n\nEdit: oh sorry, rereading your comment, I think you were referring to the scaling of the dots in the animation.

A grenade is designed to make a lot of damage and shrapnel intentionally. We actually have a lot of practice and engineering on how to stop individual high speed projectiles though. And we do practically deal with this daily with the ISS and other launch vehicles. The main thing is to treat the skin of a space craft like kevlar, many layers of material that are good at resisting impact and puncture. Top that with a positive pressure environment and tiny holes don't cause catastrophic incidents. \n\nOn top of that they have tracking and known orbits for larger debris that they steer around. \n\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com/innovation/how-do-the-iss-and-other-satellites-protect-against-space-debris.html\n\nNot saying it isn't a problem, but your take on it is a bit sensationalized.",

In what situation would you encounter the same cloud of debris every 90 minutes, moving at high speed relative to you? If you share an orbit with the debris, then you're moving at the same speed. If the same orbit but opposite directions, then you should encounter it every 45 minutes. Same if you're in similar orbits, but different inclinations (or possibly never encounter it at all). If the orbits are totally different, then it seems unlikely you would encounter it periodically. Like, maybe you're in a circular orbit, and the debris is in an elliptical orbit with the same perihelion. In that case, the elliptical orbit is likely a different period than 90 minutes, and so you'd have to wait much longer to encounter the debris again. I suppose it's always possible to come up with an elliptical orbit that is exactly 90 minutes that touches your circular orbit, with both you and the debris arriving at that spot at the same time, but that seems very unlikely to me.",

Anything that is going into space, especially to orbit the planet, must have it's flight paths cleared to ensure it won't interact with any of the debris already left in low earth orbit [LEO]. If there is a debris collision with a craft, satellite, or other debris, it runs the risk of obliterating one or both pieces, making a shit load of untrackable small debris flying all over. This can cause a runaway chain effect that could lead to so much small junk orbiting randomly in LEO that we would never be able to get into space or launch satellites. Telescopes would eventually be rendered useless, then later, communications sats would be unreachable.\n\nAnd it's almost happened.",

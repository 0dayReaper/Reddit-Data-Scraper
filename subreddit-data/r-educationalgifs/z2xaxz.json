They were new and cool, so every trendy electronics device had to have them.\n\nMaybe that's the cause of you noticing that \"everything turned blue for a decade\".  I don't remember the fad spreading to things other than the LEDs themselves, but maybe I just didn't notice.",

One blatantly aiming for the mid-90s prominently put a Nerf Maverick revolver on the bed. Those came out in 2005. The Nerf guns we had a decade earlier were foam blunderbusses in comparison.",

That and the fact that screens are incredibly high resolution now. \n\nLike the chunky stuff of the 80's and up till the era of LCD...they needed the chunky interface so you could distinguish what you're looking at and where you could vs couldn't click. \n\nBut also the smartphone BS is what drives design language because that's where most of the money is. So they cater to that and in order to cut costs they don't put effort into stuff like classic theme anymore. I hate it.",

When it comes to selecting text I think there's a few tricks that might make your life easier.\n\n* I never click and drag on text to highlight it. Not in the traditional way most people do. The mouse is an imprecise control mechanism that has a propensity to flake out. (like you described in your comment for example)\n* Always start by double clicking a word. This will auto highlight the entire word. From that point, if you're only highlighting a small amount of text, you can drag your cursor over a few words and it'll automatically select the entire next word, not the character position. This makes accuracy with the mouse a lot less important. You just have to be on the right word, not the exact character location.\n* \\*\\*Edit\\*\\* Double click the first word you want to to highlight, scroll to the bottom of the text then hold shift and click the end word. This works way better than clicking, holding the mouse down and dragging. \n* If you need to select a lot of text, TRIPLE click a paragraph. Triple clicking will select the entire paragraph. It's super fast and easy.\n* If you need to select a lot of paragraphs, first start by triple clicking the first paragraph. Then hold down shift + control and click the second paragraph. This will highlight that next paragraph in one click. It's kinda sweet how it works. Test it and play with it. It's not super hard to get the hang of.\n* Use the keyboard for highlighting instead of the mouse. Start by double clicking one word. Next hold down control and shift together and then use the arrow keys on your keyboard. It selects things word by word or line by line, not character by character at that point. It's fast and easy.\n* Use shift + home and end keys to highlight entire lines fast af. Double click the first word on a line, then hold shift + end and highlight the whole line at once. I feel like most users never touch these keys on their keyboard but they're super useful.\n* Ctrl + home or end key will jump you from the bottom to the top or the top to the bottom of web pages, excel spreadsheets, or any long document type thing.\n* Copy and paste in chunks. Triple click one paragraph then hit ctrl c to copy. Then triple click another paragraph and hit ctrl c again. Then instead of hitting control v, hit Windows key + v, all of the things you copied will be on a clip board for you to recall all the last things you copied. This is a ridiculously useful way to deal with copying and pasting a bunch of different things.\n* Bonus tip: Hold control down when you use the backspace button. It'll backspace the entire word off instead of going one character at a time. This took me a long time to overcome my muscle memory of hitting backspace 36 times in rapid succession to clear out a lot of text. Once I got the hang of it though it sunk in how much better and easier it is.\n\nLike I said, I've spent a ridiculous amount of time figuring all kinds of little tricks for bullshit like this.",

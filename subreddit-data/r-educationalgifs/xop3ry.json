For a college-level stats class, it would be somewhat surprising such a small percentage didn\u2019t know, and prof may have assumed it was a participation issue, not a knowledge issue.

Some various thoughts:\n\n- It's hard to make the connection that i and N are bounds, and more specifically that they are related to the set of numbers you're looking to add together. I'd mention that x_i is the *i*th item in your set of x-values.\n\n- Is the set of numbers here a random group? That's fine, but I think it'd be more useful if you went in with some more intent with your set. You could do 1-10, or 1-20, or go full history lesson and do 1-100 and bring up how Gauss solved that in seconds as a child, supposedly.\n\nI do like the video itself and think it was edited well, I just want a little more clarity to the explanation. And if this was taken from a longer video that includes that clarity, then I apologize.",

Every once in a while someone goes out at the wrong time and gets stuck. The rescue teams will attempt to get them out and sometimes do, but as the tied comes in the person often drowns first. I've even heard stories of rescuers just handing the stuck person a cellphone and telling them to say their goodbyes.\n\nOn a few occasions they've tried to use four wheelers/cars/helicopters to pull people out and rip them in half like in the video.\n\nEdit: lots of hate about the ripped in half part. I've heard a few of \"friend of a friend knew a guy\" accounts of this and Google doesn't show any confirmed instances so I'd believe it's folklore. But, the mud tightens the more force you apply to it so I believe it's possible even if it's unlikely to have happened",

You wouldn\u2019t attempt something like that until you\u2019d exhausted all other options, which means that conditions are going to be way less than ideal; people are panicking, tired, worn out, maybe adrenaline is wearing off. That increases the chance that mistakes will be made and a field amputation is a pretty detail-oriented thing. It\u2019s not the chop-and-run it seems. One of the officers commented that it\u2019s also a liability thing: If she drowns, nature killed her after hours of exhaustive efforts by rescuers. If you cut off her leg and she dies of blood loss or shock or both, then you killed her. Sure, it was in an attempt to save her life, but you\u2019re now open to a civil suit and investigation, not to mention the psychological trauma that would come from a woman dying in your arms after you cut her leg off. \n\nIn this specific instance, amputation wouldn\u2019t have been practical because by the time rescuers were alerted and arrived, the water was already up to her chest. Dive teams don\u2019t have surgeons and while I am not a surgeon, I imagine that trying to amputate someone\u2019s leg without anesthesia (she\u2019s already hypothermic and weak and further depressing her heart rate would significantly increase the chances of death) who also needs to keep holding onto a hose to breathe out of would be impossible.",

That is just a video of quicksand fetishism, I\u2019ve seen the same guy do other videos at other places and he is just fine. In fact it\u2019s a joke in the quicksand fetish community to laugh at moments like this when people mistaken their fetish videos for actual quicksand and death. \n\nQuicksand fetishism centers around the feeling of the substance and the love for roleplaying a perilous situation like right out of a Hollywood movie. Real quicksand is hardly ever used because it\u2019s just too \u201cboring\u201d for us. Instead it\u2019s mostly just regular clay, mud, peat, marsh, or big pits like oh see above. It\u2019s just a harmless mud pit. \n\nSeriously he\u2019s *okay*. If you want to learn more just look to the Vice documentary on the subject. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OcvH4T_qzE0",

You aren\u2019t going to drown like you would if you fell into the ocean. People are more buoyant than quicksand so you won\u2019t just sink all the way under like you would with water. People usually step or fall into quicksand, so it\u2019s usually the legs that get caught first. But yeah, obstructed breathing will kill you, so if you dive in head first you could drown. What that statement is trying to express, I believe, is that quicksand doesn\u2019t really function like it does in movies where you gradually get sucked all the way under no matter what, which is a much more conventional image of drowning. So no, you won\u2019t drown like on TV but yes, it is still within the realm of physical possibility that a person could obstruct their breathing with quicksand and \u201cdrown.\u201d",

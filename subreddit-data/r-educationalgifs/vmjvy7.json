I know now they can\u2019t remove the dam because the sediment would destroy the river should it be released at once. It doesn\u2019t help that apparently there are higher levels than anticipated of uranium of all things in the sediment.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is the riverbed is made from sediments, why are they so bad for the environment if they would\u2019ve been in the river anyway? Why can\u2019t they let them free to travel where and when they wish?",

After the dam, the water temp was significantly colder downstream because the water coming out of the dam from the bottom was so cold. That, and the lack of sediment, caused huge problems with habit just being washed away and not replaced and the actual river being too cold for a lot of fish and frogs.",

That's a problem, as these damns need maintainance now, but usually that's not possible anymore because of newer buildings downstream. So past engineers said 'That's a problem for future engineers' and left it at that.\n\nThe guy doing his thesis was trying to model if injecting water during flushing could increase the effectiveness. Some damns, when they get flushed, only get rid of 20% of the sediment.  \nThe theory was, by using high pressure water, either by spraying from above the sediment bed or by using hoses buried in the sediment, more sediment could be removed during one flush. I'm not sure if it could work, the guy wasn't very good.\n\nThey use something similar in dredging barges.",

You see all that sediment contains tons of heavy metals and all sorts of nasty stuff. If they were to start removing the sediment, they would dislodge a lot of that stuff and downriver it goes. Usually into a place like the Chesapeake which no one wants. So it sits there until we figure out the best way to remove it that makes sense cost wise and environmental wise. It almost makes more sense to build another dam before any remediation on the old dam starts. A lot of US dams are past the point of full sedimentation, which is a problem engineering is trying to solve. If you can figure out a way to clear that stuff without having to shutdown the dam and without it flowing downriver you would be very rich. One of the biggest issues is not getting the crap out though, it's where to put it before transfer, how to haul it away, and where it's final disposition is located. No one wants that poisonous crud.",

Heavy metals sink and become trapped in the sediment. Then over time sediment is transferred downstream and now your heavy metals are in deeper layers. It wasn't until the clean water act in the 70's that we started to try and regulate this. But the compounds don't break down so they are still there",

Right now there aren\u2019t any good ways of clearing out the sediment buildup, the current solutions are usually: Opening the gates which is cheap and does clear a small cone in front of the gate but does little to manage the overall sediment. Sediment buildup can also pose a risk to generators or tunnels going through the dam by creating cavitation and that could lead to structural problems. Dredging is another option but is very expensive and can be damaging to the surrounding environment. For dams that are used as a water reservoirs the sediment buildup can reduce capacity.\n\n[Link](https://www.hydroreview.com/world-regions/dealing-with-sediment-effects-on-dams-and-hydropower-generation) for those who want a little more in depth look into this issue.",

Others that can't just lower reservoir levels probably do dredge operations from barges if that's feasible. (cranes with dredge buckets on floating barges). I've heard that they can probably drain the dam from the lowest outlet tower to flush sediment out but I somehow doubt it since they are still required to maintain water quality of the downflow to some degree and sediment is a pollutant even without heavy metals or other contaminants.",

If there was gold in the water it would get captured behind the obstacle with the silt. Obviously we\u2019re talking tiny amounts here but it can add up especially if you find an obstruction like this that no one else has been near",

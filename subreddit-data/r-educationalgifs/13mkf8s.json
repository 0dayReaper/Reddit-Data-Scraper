Racism in response to racism doesn't make the world less racist, it just feeds the cycle. \n\nThat's a really bad example. Some bullies want to get a rise out of you and some bullies want you to sit back and take it. Sometimes, sitting back and taking it also feeds the cycle. It's an ugly truth that parents don't want to tell their kids for fear of making them needlessly violent, but hitting back is sometimes a good idea. And especially once you're a grown adult, there might not be someone bigger for you to go to and tell when some racist starts knocking on your door to tell you you aren't welcome there.\n\nAlso, as far as I can see, the color of the actress's skin doesn't really matter because the color of Cleopatra's skin wasn't directly important to her legacy the same way it was to, say, Malcolm X or MLK. No one is going out of their way to portray Cleopatra with a Greek or Persian or Greek/Persian actress, despite those people sharing phenotypes much closer to the real Cleopatra because those minute details aren't important to the modern audience. However, minute details like that are important to plenty of other racists who want to ostracize, say, Jews, so there's plenty of global historical context for caring about those kinds of smaller details in regards to determining a person's race. **The importance that everyone is putting on her skin color now is more a reflection of the audience than it is of historical facts.**\n\nI've read through hundreds of these comments on this post and others, and literally none of them ever point the lens back at themselves and interrogate what these arguments say about them, they just take it at face value that they just are correct. It's mind-numbingly ridiculous.",

Even if you're not the one committing those crimes, Chinese people still feel less safe.

To take an entire country that, today, people can look at and be like- yup looks light skinned/middle eastern, and declare the ancient ruling class must have been black is just bizarre. Not even taking into account that Cleopatra was Greek, that\u2019s just a very strange thing to declare.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary to take an entire culture that we can all see with our eye balls right now and declare they all must have been black. They could use their time and platform to focus on Nzinga of Ndongo (Modern day Angola) who was an absolutely unstoppable baddass when she ruled. She fought the Portuguese during the Portuguese slave trade. She was such an unstoppable force that the Portuguese were actually afraid of her, and she helped resettle freed slaves when she would beat them back. Her mom was a slave concubine, so she was never supposed to even rule, but she was so charismatic and loved by everyone that she took the throne anyway.\n\nIf they want a more mythical story with the same kind of legend quality Cleopatra has they could focus on Makeda, the queen of Shiba the Bible refers to. She was queen in modern day Ethiopia. \n\nHell if they\u2019re in insistent on focusing on Egypt, they could have just highlighted Hatshepsut who was the only woman to rule as pharaoh. I saw a trailer for the Cleopatra show and it says \u201cwhen women ruled as queens\u201d. Women never ruled in ancient Egypt! Ancient Egyptian culture was incredibly patriarchal. Cleopatra only ruled is queen and had every intention of finding a husband. She wasn\u2019t attempting to rule as the lone ruler of Egypt. The only woman who ever ruled as pharaoh was Hatshepsut, and her rule was a time of prosperity and peace. And she was actually Egyptian, not Greek.\n\nThere is no reason to even attempt what they\u2019re doing. There we\u2019re actual black African queens with amazing stories. They\u2019re acting as if the only way you can show a black woman as a prominent ruler is by twisting the history of other ethnicities. It\u2019s insulting to black women and it shits on an entire culture.",

They fought with one another for periods but they even had long periods of peace where Egypt leaned on Nubia to fight their wars for them because they were so well renowned for their armies. \n\nI know the ancient Nubians are often called the black Pharaohs which people confuse for Egyptian pharaohs.",

This was based largely on the examination of a headless skeleton of a female child in a 20 BCE tomb in\u00a0Ephesus\u00a0(modern\u00a0Turkey), together with the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull. The remains were hypothesized to be those of\u00a0Arsinoe IV, half-sister to Cleopatra,[17][18]\u00a0and conjecture based on discredited processes suggested that the remains belonged to a girl whose \"race\" may have been \"North African\". This claim is rejected by scholars, based on the remains being impossible to identify as Arsinoe, the race of the remains being impossible to identify at all, the fact that the remains belonged to a child much younger than Arsinoe when she died, and the fact that Arsinoe and Cleopatra shared the same father,\u00a0Ptolemy XII Auletes, but may have had different mothers.\n\n\nShe was African Cope harder",

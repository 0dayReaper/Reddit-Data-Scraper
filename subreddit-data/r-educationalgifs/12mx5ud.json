If the punp was a positive displacement type (like hydraulics) with a constant input speed the volumetric and mass flow rate would (within 99%) stay the same , but pressure would increase on the side of the constriction, drop in the constriction with increased velocity, and go back up again on the discharge side.\n\nWith a centrifugal pump, if the pump outlet pressure increases, the volumetric flow will drop.\n\n(I'm being very pedantic, classic reddit)",

In any case though, it's one of those things where you can trade force for distance and vice versa, like a lever or a ramp. In this example the cylinders are the same size, but suppose I push on a long, skinny cylinder, but the other end is a short, wide cylinder with the same volume? In that case, the short cylinder moves a shorter distance than I pushed the long cylinder, because each unit of length in the cylinder has more space for the liquid to fill, but the force that comes out of it is greater than what I put in, because that force comes from the pressure in the tube being applied to the piston at the end, pressure is the amount of force applied per unit of area, and the short, wide tube has more area for the liquid to push on.",

It's very easy to understand take any door near you and try moving it by pushing near the handle it's easy because it is away from the joint but the same\ndoor being pushed from the center needs more force until near the joint you just can't push it without exerting a lot of force. \n\nThe second concept is of gear ratio. If you have two gears that are identical lets call them gear \"x\" and attached to one another turning one will have the other one turning at the same speed and force(torque). If you changed one of them to a smaller one and turned the remaining gear x, the smaller one will turn more times per each revolution of gear x and if you turned the smaller one then gear x would turn slower but it turns with more torque because of many moments caused by the teeth of the small gear. \n\nThe third concept is a simple scale, you can lift an elephant if it's on a scale and another elephant is on there. \n\nWhat we do with something like a tower crane is have counter weights that can be switched to as needed to lift heavier things while motors turn small gear to gain a lot of torque. Another thing there are different oils that extremely hate getting compressed so unlike the water used in the video if you compressed one side the other side would jump out more so in heavy machines what we have is small counter weighs inside with gears that combined together will generate torque that turns into a force that compresses the oil and voila you have a working CAT or jcb.",

Think of them like multiple of these syringes or pistons in a circle all pointing the same direction. They are attached to a \u201cswash plate\u201d which is an angled plate that rotates from a gear train (PTO) attached to the truck engine. This swash plate rotates and forces the syringes or pistons to move in and out. \n\nThis forces the piston to draw fluid from the reservoir tank and press it out under pressure to the hyraulic system. \n\nThese were designed to run at a fixed system presssure with accumulators and pressure valves to maintain it. The pumps also had automatically adjusting swash plates to easily maintain a fixed pressure whether the operator was sitting idle or moving multiple pistons on the machine at once. \n\nThen the operator moves a hydraulic switch or lever and it supplies that system pressure to a hydraulic cylinder or actuator that moves the boom or equipment around to lift you up or dig holes. \n\nBelow gif shows the angled swash plate rotating and moving the pumps internal cylinder back and forth to create pressure and flow. \n\nhttps://www.animatedsoftware.com/pics/pumps/aniben36.gif",

                            "comment": "The power side generally isn't done by pushing on a container to push fluid out, you feed lower pressure fluid into a pump and it pushes it at higher pressure over to the side where you want force.\n\nReally the pump is overcoming the pressure in the system; the fluid pushed out by the pump will take the easiest (least restrictive) path available. If there isn't a lot of restriction, the flow coming out of the pump won't be at high pressure.",

This is more of an example of how single acting hydraulic cylinders work but instead of the fluid being sucked out of the cylinder as depicted here, single acting cylinders work by gravity on one end and hydraulic pressure on the other.  For example, a dump truck.  Hydraulic pressure extends the cylinder to lift the bed and gravity and the weight of the bed retracts the cylinder when the valve is actuated.  Still a cool visual example.",

            "comment": "The transfer of energy through fluid power systems allows for the transmission of force and motion without the need for complex mechanical linkages. In hydraulic power applications, a small bore cylinder can be used to power a larger bore cylinder, resulting in an increase in force that is proportional to the difference in areas between the two cylinders. This principle, known as Pascal's Law, demonstrates the real-world use of fluid power by allowing for the amplification of force and the efficient transfer of energy over long distances.\n\nHydraulic power systems can amplify force, they do not provide mechanical advantage in the same way that traditional mechanical systems do. Mechanical advantage refers to the ability to multiply force or increase the efficiency of work, typically through the use of gears, levers, or pulleys. In hydraulic systems, the force is transferred through the fluid itself, rather than through mechanical linkages. While hydraulic power systems can provide a significant increase in force, they do not provide the same type of mechanical advantage as traditional mechanical systems.\n\nWater is known for its low compressibility, which means that it is difficult to reduce its volume even under high pressure. At a depth of 4 km in the ocean, the pressure is about 40 MPa, or over 5800psi, which is about 400 times atmospheric pressure at sea level. Despite this immense pressure, water still only decreases in volume by about 1.8%, which is a testament to its low compressibility. This property of water has important implications for marine life and oceanography, as it affects the behavior of water currents and the distribution of nutrients and gases in the ocean.\n\nThe low compressibility of water is an important property that allows it to maintain a relatively stable volume and density even under high pressure. This property has important implications for oceanography, as it affects the behavior of water currents and the distribution of nutrients and gases in the ocean. For example, the pressure gradient caused by the variation in water density with depth is a major driving force for ocean circulation, which in turn affects the transport of heat and nutrients around the globe. The low compressibility of water also plays a role in the formation of deep-sea trenches and hydrothermal vents, which are unique environments that support diverse communities of marine life.",

By exerting the force into a really narrow syringe, you get a really high pressure (since pressure is force over area). That pressure then gets exerted on another  much thicker syringe by the hydraulic liquid, which will result in a higher force since the area is higher but pressure is the same. It doesn't violate any laws of physics since the travel distance of the thin syringe is a lot longer (because it holds less fluid per cross-section). It's identical to how a lever works to multiply forces.",

That\u2019s our brain.  And we can even put a number on how many of those it takes to make a \u2018you\u2019 - that number is about 100 billion.  \n  \nBut what\u2019s cool is you can take away large chunks of them and you\u2019ll still be \u2018you\u2019 (or a form of it).  Sure, after a certain point you\u2019ll cease to be \u2018you\u2019 - but for the most part you still will be.  \n  \nYou\u2019re just a colony of brain cells, protected by 100 trillion other cells.  (Those other cells do less interesting things like be skin, and make the heart pump, and are toenails).  \n  \nRight now those brain cells tho, they are all firing and working together to read these words, to decode the symbols you learned in your youth that \u2018meant things\u2019 and translate those symbols back to abstract concepts.  \n  \nHello little cells.  You\u2019re all working very hard aren\u2019t you!  Hope you know you\u2019re loved and appreciated!",

                    "comment": "Currently working on my PhD in neuroscience with a thesis project focusing on memory, so despite my crippling impostor syndrome, i think i might be slightly qualified to answer this.\n\nIll start out by saying, that paying attention to the neurites (tendrils) in this video is a great observation! I too was struck by how they are formed. Particularly the fact that when the cell begins to differentiate from this flat amorphous form into a more traditional neuronal shape, those neurites were already attached to targets and they held firmly throughout the process! Its reminiscent of those experiments describing how a slime mold can \"solve a maze\".\n\nTangent aside, the short answer is no, the thickness of the neurite isnt directly related to the strength of the memory stored. \n\nNeurite thickness IS important with its relationship to electrical properties of the cell, the integration of incoming and velocity of outgoing signals depend on the neurite diameter and the membrane thickness. \n\nLike /u/rwhite2366 pointed out, myelination of the axon (possibly the thick neurite trailing off to the right in the video, but there is no way to be sure here) will change the thickness of the neurite and its conduction velocity as a consequence. But myelination is actually performed by another supportive cell ONTO the neuron, not the neuron itself. I wish we had a paper to reference for this video, but i don't think those supportive cells (oligodendrocytes or shwann cells) are present in this tissue culture. \n\nAxonal myelination will modulate the speed and fidelity of an action potential (i.e. signal) being sent to a downstream target. Though increase myelination in the brain is seen within axonal bundles connecting two regions with strong functional connectivity, the direct relationship it shares with memory is not well understood. Instead, more evidence points toward myelination being correlated to speed of cognition (i.e. conditions where myelination decreases in the brain like aging or MS, is associated with cognitive slowing).\n\nWelp theres another tangent, back to memory. /u/WhereverSheGoes is referring to the canonical explanation for memory, the synaptic plasticity hypothesis of memory. The SPHM posits that memories are stored through the process of selective strengthening and weakening of the connections between neurons (synapses). \n\nCanonically synaptic connections are potentiated or depressed (strengthened or weakened) through the transient or permanent insertion of new ion channels into the synaptic membrane. But synaptic plasticity can also be accomplished through morphological, metabolic, and molecular changes. This is to say, to change the strength of a synaptic connection a cell might change the shape of the synapse, the conductance of ions across its membrane, the strength of enzymatic signaling cascades in a given region, the presence of particular proteins within the synapse, or all of the above. \n\nSimply put, no stone goes unturned in the process of storing a memory. Neurons are like Maybelline when it comes to storing memoryies, theyre born with it. They are built to send signals between one another and strengthen or weaken connections with experience. Nearly every cellular mechanism is related in some one. \n\nWe dont know exactly how memories are stored, but we do know alot of what goes on that is associated to their storage. Maybe my project will make a reasonable contribution to this field, but i doubt it. If you enjoyed this unsolicited dissertation, please let my thesis committee know so they can pass me. Thank you",

This can be as reductionist as inducing a change at the level of ONE neuronal connection up to as complicated as the presence of simple behavioral reactions to an experimental situation (like can they learn a maze or remember a place associated with a reward). Thats it, thats as far as we've gotten as basic neuroscientists in our understanding of how the brain makes memories. \n\nThe massive chasm where I am just one of many scientists performing research, is trying to bridge that gap between what we know about day-to-day memory, and what we study as memory in the laboratory setting. \n\nSo they best advice that you could trust me to give to help cultivate a good memory for you and your toddler is the same advice youd get from a pediatrician. Good diet, regular exercise, quality sleep, good parental support, adequate challenges and stimulation. \n\nThere is a ton of \"biohacking\" stuff for memory out there, but in my opinion its correlative (not causative) at best, and pseudoscientific at worst. The best things are the long games, the tried-and-true strategies. Beyond that, when your toddler gets older there are plenty of psychology driven strategies that can help in improving memory.",

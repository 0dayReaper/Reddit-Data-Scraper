Once the undulation starts to set in the tense protrusions have spread to every inch of skin. When their movement becomes rhythmical pulsations flowing over my body like waves of flesh I know the moment is close. All movement suddenly stops and there is a moment of stillness before the tense skin finally gives away like bubble-wrap to reveal the gaping holes littering my body.\n\n***^((Kids, don't use writing random short stories as a way to procrastinate, it's a dangerous drug.)***   \n***^(I have a uni paper to write and what the fuck am I doing?))***",

I could \"feel\" them unwinding throughout my body as I pulled, and they left big \"crater\" like holes on the sides of my thumb. Stuff like pebbles and bits of plastic would fall in and I had trouble getting them out. It was truly traumatizing as I would get flashbacks for a number of years.\n\nSoon after, I developed trypophobia specifically regarding collections of holes with depth/ apparent underlayers. I got serious shivers when I first saw a documentary with these li'l bastards. Blech! (At least it seems a bit less bad when close up, versus seeing the holes as part of the toad's back.)",

Just keep scrolling if you are uncomfortable. \n\nAn excerpt from their wiki article:\n\nThe eggs then become implanted into the female\u2019s dorsal epidermis.[15] After implantation, the eggs sink into the skin and form irregular-honeycomb-looking pockets over a period of several days. The embryos develop through to the tadpole stage inside these pockets but do not emerge as tadpoles, instead remaining in their chambers until complete development to toadlet stage. The young toads grow a tail during their growth, but these will only be temporary because they will need the tail for inhaling oxygen. After 12 to 20 weeks, the young toads will hatch as small toads, looking identical to their parents. It takes a while for them to grow bigger since they are only 25 mm long when they are born. Once they have emerged from their mother's back, the toads begin a largely solitary life. After giving birth to the new toads, the mother slowly sheds the thin layer of skin used for birth and can begin the cycle again.",

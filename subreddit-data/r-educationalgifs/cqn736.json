When a cover starts developing, it will lead to a bunch of other things like animal habitat and the development of other things like fungi and whatnot which would all sink carbon alongside the growing trees. You will also have other plants that will start growing soon after the trees are a meter or two high (which should be achievable in the first year or so of growth) in the shade as well.\n\nPlanting the trees is crucial. Our more common planting methods are manual and use saplings. It takes time. What I would like to see is maybe germinated seeds, or at least tiny saplings, being placed within the pods before being planted. Maybe those will have a higher rate of success.",

Barely anything else can live there and you don\u2019t have to be a biologist to understand how this phenomenon is destroying the original forest ecosystems, you just have to look at them. They look absolutely nothing alike. 80 years of growth in such plantations does nothing for the biodiversity, they are still almost barren of life besides the spruce themselves. I have personally visited such spruce plantations ready for harvest, there is no life there. They are actually more similar to deserts than to natural forests. \nNow, I don\u2019t know which hardwood plantations you are talking about or where you are from, but you\u2019d have to provide some pretty good sources to convince me that they have much more ecological value than the spruce plantations I\u2019m familiar with. \nI am a biologist with quite a bit of knowledge about ecology, ecosystem function, ecosystem services, and biodiversity, so I\u2019m not just pulling this out of my ass, but I also welcome new perspectives if you\u2019d like to teach me something new.",

And he really sold it, gushing about what a privilege it was to work with all of us and how he'll be rooting for us from afar, etc. \n\nAll I could think was, \"dude, stop bullshitting -- you fucked up everything you touched then checked the fuck out when you got in too deep\". But since no one else in upper management wants to be unceremoniously kicked to curb when their time comes, he was allowed to spin the narrative save face on the way while keeping his professional reputation intact for future jobs. All told he lost the company like $20 million and left a huge team of people in complete disarray on the way out. Last I checked, his Linked In now shows him working in another high-level position at a big media company.",

A lot of it is done by hand and a lot of it is done by dropping seeds from a plane,  drones really arent much different. The most important thing is that they drop natural seeds and not genetically modified ones that are designed to consume way more water than natural trees. They may grow faster but they kill the plants around them and biodiversity is everything",

Yet not every of them would successfully grow into another plant.\n\nThere's a reason why forestation plantation needs to be at specific location. We read about them in news all the time- a million were planted, but we never see it. why, because it's hidden away. In short they can't just do it anywhere, not just throwing seeds on sidewalk in the city.\n\nSeeds won't grow into trees instantly. There are lots of factors that need to be considered. soil types. ground condition. ground layers. flora in the area. fauna in the area. wind. water runoff. etc. all these can inhibit the growth.\n\nThey also need to consider the effect. How the fauna population lives in the area, wether their lives be disturbed by the new trees because it replace their food source, wether they will eat the plant, etc. or if the plant actually has way to germinate themselves after, or will the weather accomodate their growth, etc.\n\nMost importantly we don't even plant from seeds. We plant them from the saplings. The plant would need to be strong enough to root itself at least. Hence why forestation is a slow process. From all of the seedlings, not every of them will grow either. Some are eaten by wild animals, some collapsed from the wind, etc.\n\nIf we just want planting trees then palm oil plantation would have solved global warming because we planted millions of palm oil trees. Instead they're the bane of the ecosystem.",

Where either the outside of the seed needs to be damaged to promote growth by either passing through the gut of an animal, extreme heat like from a forest fire or being chewed on by a squirrel which is scarification. Stratification is when it needs a long period of time exposed to cold temperatures before it can be germinated. Then once you get past that step and it is planted it will need to be perfect growing conditions for it to germinate and grow, it will need to survive not being eaten by animals and outcompete other vegetation growing in that area. So is this process likely to work? No. Is it possible? No.",

                                    "comment": "This is insanely complicated and you'll never find a report or study that gives you an easy answer. A tabloid version is not going to be correct, but here's a super basic explanation that is ignoring a few thousand factors: \n\nPlants on land produce roughly 50% of O2, the oxygen gas we need to breathe. The rest is produced by phytoplankton.  \n\nIt's important to note that neither produce the element oxygen, but are performing chemical processes that strip oxygen atoms out of for instance water H2O, and building carbon chains (for instance sugar mainly carbon and hydrogen) and releasing oxygen in the form of O2 as a result. \n\nThis is the first step in the photosynthesis we all know. Jumping a lot of steps, and arriving at the other end of the lifetime when grass, trees and so on dies, burning or metabolizing (bacteria and animals eating) the plant reverses this process, breaking up the carbon chains binding oxygen to small hydrogen and carbon molecules like water H2O and CO2.\n\nA teeny tiny fraction of all the plant matter in a Forrest doesn't rot, get eaten or burn, but is buried. The same thing happens to phytoplankton. Over millions and millions of years a miniscule percentage of the organisms creating O2 doesn't get eaten or burned but is buried (and turns into oil, gas, coal).  \n\nOver enormous stretches of time this miniscule difference has built up to a level where we now have about 20% of the atmosphere consisting of O2. \n\nThat means a rainforest is almost 100% using all the oxygen it is producing, but so is the phytoplankton.  \n\nThere is no natural short term carbon sink that is a net positive O2 producer over its lifetime.",

Carbon Dioxide and Methane both trap far more heat energy than oxygen for example. \n\nTrees break up CO2, they use the Carbon, and release the O2. O2 is nowhere near the insulator that CO2 is, so more trees is beneficial. The other greenhouse gasses still need to be dealt with, but having vast forests is still overall a healthy outcome.",

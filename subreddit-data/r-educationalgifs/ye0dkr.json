Inorganic chemists usually work with transition metal complexes and so they usually work in industry/research. Usually that entails working with air/water sensitive materials. I enjoyed inorganic chem since it intersects so many different fields of study and it got me interested in materials science. \n\nI have friends that work in semiconductor industry, battery industry, and some are in grad school. I know my answer wasn't as much help but hopefully it gave you a slightly better idea of what it's like.",

It reacts with a bunch of different bacteria to become ammonia and it does it with an enzyme called nitrogenase. \n\nYou can also brute force it with lightning that has enough energy to rip the bonds apart from the dinitrogen and then the nitrogen reacts with water, oxygen, other atmospheric gases and pollutants in the air to form nitrogen oxides, nitric acid, nitrites/nitrates, etc.\n\nIt will also react with a lot of the alkali metals like Lithium, Potassium, Caesium, etc.",

If I had to guess, it would form N2, maybe O2, and H2O upon detonation.\n\nHave you ever heard of heats of formation and bond dissociation energies? There are tables of bond energies that depend on what elements are bonded together and if it's a single, double, or triple bond. If you add up all these energies, you get an estimate of how much energy it takes to form the molecule entirely. So since it's an exothermic, explosive reaction, the bond dissociation energies of N=-N, O=O, and two H-O's must be significantly lower than all of the NH4NO3's bonds added up.\n\nIf I had to guess at the mechanism, now this is based on a 10 year old organic chem memory, I would think one of the H's would come off of the ammonium and bond with one of the O's in the nitrate, the OH- ion would cause another H to be ripped from the N as oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen. Then a very unstable NH2- would very quickly attract the N in nitrate as it is the +pole of the bond, and simultaneously the electrons from the two N-O bonds would bond the two O's together.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

Oxygen, nitrogen and mixtures of the two get affected the exact same amount by temp change above cryogenic temps and below several hundreds of degrees C or F. This is where the ideal gas law applies the most and specific heats are nearly constant. The specific heats are different, but the thermal mass of the air in a tire is totally negligible, so once it's up to temp they are all identical.\n\nThe big, big deal is that a N2 canister has no water in it. Water vapor will evaporate and condense over the range of temps and pressures tires see. This has huge effects on the temp/pressure relationship even if the % of water vapor in ambient air is really low. No two air compressors will leave the same percentage of water behind, and no two days a compressor is run will have the same absolute humidity. Normal compressed air works well enough in enough applications that few people are selling completely dry compressed air, because most potential customers will just buy an air compressor. Pure O2 is dangerous near organic materials at high temps, so N2 is just the best option to get something that's like air and totally dry in significant quantities.",

Biggest cost of chips is transportation costs. Potatoes are insanely cheap per pound, corn or potato flakes are even cheaper. Lots of push on your chip companies to max out the truck weight as much as they can which is not fun for the operators. Trying to shove 200 bags in the tiniest box you can just doesn't work well, but if you drop air fill/bag size you increase product in end seal and massively increase complaints and rejects. It's a balancing act but everyone will still bitch about \"3 chips in a bag!\"",

This is because the design of the aluminum can relies on the pressure from carbonation for strong walls, because the walls are so thin. You can observe the addition of air by squeezing a can before and after it's open. Also, you can compare this to bottles, and how you hear distinctly less air rush out of a bottle than a can if the drink is carbonated and none from the bottle if it's not. This is because plastic bottles are more solid. I think they might add nitrogen to cans with carbonation, at least a little, just to increase internal pressure. Very interesting use of gasses though!",

                    "comment": "In home brewing beer, it's common to purge your keg with CO2 prior to racking to offend oxidation. It makes me cry with how expensive CO2 can get if you brew often. You don't have to do it, but I've seen a huge difference in how long the beer stays fresh in the keg with purging vs not.",

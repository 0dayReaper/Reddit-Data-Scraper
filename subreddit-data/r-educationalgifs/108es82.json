When you push or pull on something it creates a pressure wave that travels through the object. When it gets to the other end it bounces back, and because the speed of pressure (aka. the speed of sound) is finite this takes some interval of time. When the wave gets back to where it started it bounces again, and the wave keeps bounces back and forth until all the energy is lost. If the object doesn't deform much or change its composition in the meantime, the time it takes for the wave to do one bounce doesn't change either, which is why you get the fixed pattern that we call resonance.\n\nIf you push on the object with the same frequency as its resonance frequency, the waves you create will stack on top of each other and you get a huge resulting pressure wave creating huge motion. If they don't match the frequency or some integer multiple (called a harmony) they don't stack and dissipate without getting larger than the first push.",

There's a couple different mechanisms of action but essentially the 2 tectonic plates squishing past each other or crashing into each other is like the initial strike that causes the tuning fork to vibrate. The initial force might be irregular, but the energy travels through the ground as waves because that's how energy travels. The specifics of the waves have to do with the material they're travel through- a single piece of refined metal in the tuning fork has very fast and clean vibrations, a 1000 mile long chunk of stone and soil probably has less symmetrical waves transmission.",

One day we were doing a session and I noticed this noise from seemingly out of nowhere, that was super low frequency and more of a low rumble that I felt more than heard. I stop the tape like \"what the fuck is that noise?\" and nobody else can hear it. I walk over to try to pinpoint it and it disappears. I walk back to where I was standing and it's clear as day right there, but nowhere else in the room. From what I could tell, when the furnace was running, it was creating a low frequency that was normally too quiet to hear, but from where it was positioned in the basement and the walls, there was a spot where the reflections created a perfect standing wave.",

Ellipses have a property where anything that starts from one of their 2 focal points and bounces off the edge of the ellipse will travel through the other focal point. By setting up a dish that mimics part of an ellipse you can focus all the sound from a set distance onto the microphone (placed at the other focal point) and pick up distant noise over any noise in between. This is often used in sports with parabolic microphones on the sideline picking up the players speaking on the field over all of the stadium noise around them.",

In resonance, the waves add together, because they closely match. \n\nImagine you're on a swing, and someone pushes you, the next time they push it's just as you're at the perfect moment and they add to your own momentum - making you go even faster. That's what's happening in this video. \n\nThe reason why it differs between heights is because of the distance of the mass from the acting force at the bottom. Something shorter will move less distance before moving back again. Longer ones move further. If the frequencies match, and they add together. \n\nThis can be useful, such as in Tapei, the giant skyscraper there had a huge dampening mass in the top centre. Like, fucking huge. Because it is dampened, it will be effectively \"slow\" to react to the initial force from an earthquake wave, and by the time the next wave hits, the mass will be on the opposite side - and so counteracts the earthquake force. \n\nIn effect, you have a sin wave and a cosine wave, cancelling each other. In the example In the video, or you on a swing, there are two sine waves,which add together",

Each frequency hits different height buildings hard because the particular frequency just happens to catch the most affected building at the exact apex of its motion.  So basically, on the low frequency, the tall building ends its sway and reverses direction at the same time as the movement at the base does.  Then it gets more force applied at the top on each swing and builds momentum. The less affected heights are hit at odd points on the reversal of direction at the base and their sway is thrown off on every swing, and therefore do not build momentum.\n\nHopefully that makes sense.",

However, if someone pushes you at the wrong point in your swing, you tend to kinda wobble or twist and don't go higher/faster. \nThat push is the timed movement from the earth's crust shaking from side to side or up to down. If the push comes at the right timing, the energy builds up and you get \"resonance.\"\n\nFor more on this phenomenon, look into the Tacoma Narrows bridge disaster, or Nikola Tesla's earthquake machine. They all work on two of the fundamental principles of waves: constructive interference and resonance.\n\nSource: Am a physicist",

Thwack a metal ruler, it'll vibrate at it's natural frequency. Same for a tuning fork, singing bowl, etc., they pick a length of fork, diameter/thickness of bowl, etc., that will cause the object to have a natural frequency at a specific note. The same principle applies to buildings, when they get shaken they will tend to wobble at their natural frequency, taller buildings have a lower natural frequency (makes sense as the wave has to travel a long distance to reach the top). Something being hit by something at it's natural frequency (or close to it) results in resonance, think of it like pushing someone on a swing, to get the maximum energy imparted to them you want to push them when they are at the top of the swing to give them the biggest boost. You can mitigate the effects of resonance by using a [tuned mass damper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuned_mass_damper) of the same natural frequency as the affected object you are trying to damp. Your car almost certainly has at least one to reduce noise and vibration.\nBonus fun fact - quartz watches (and other timekeeping devices) are called that because they have a tiny quartz resonator who's natural frequency is known and very precise, and by measuring how many times that piece of quartz has oscillated you can get an extremely accurate measure of how much time has passed.",

When an object is shaken at this resononant frequency, or a multiple of it (1/2, double etc) the energy of the vibration 'echoes' back down the object at the exact same rate as the vibration itself, leading to a strengthening vibration effect on the object (usually the object dampens itself because these vibrations and echoes are out of phase and just pass by.) this can lead to many things: buildings of a certain height falling down in an earthquake, or a bridge built in an unfortunate way shaking itself apart in a specific wind patter (Tacoma Bay Bridge Iirc, is the example we used. A suspension bridge which shook itself apart due to gusts of wind hitting its resonant frequency).",

Physically, that second spring would affect the resonance of the spring-mass system, and it would jerk the concentrated mass some small amount, depending on how much inertia (mass) the spring has relative to the block, and how much momentum the spring manages to generate. This is higher order vibration, and distracts from the purpose of the model in my opinion. \n\nInstead of a spring, you could just attach a rigid stick to the top of the concentrated mass equal to the length of the spring, such that it is again \u2018centered,\u2019 though two rigid masses affixed in that manner are still \u2018equivalent\u2019 to one rigid mass.

When the height and frequency mismatched, it's like swinging your legs wildly on a swing, you're just decaying the oscillation by introducing destructive waves that oppose eachother, while if you do it at the extremes, your waves are constructive and increase your swinging. In this example the top of the building is the swing itself, it's only constructive if a wave reaches it before being opposed again.\n\nEdit: Additionally, since waves are sinusoidal in nature, I believe the reason it's fine for Tall and short but not Medium is because it falls on the extremes for the two, and the middle for the one.",

Even though Algae produce oxygen during the day, they consume oxygen at night causing the water column to lose all oxygen and all life to die.",

I expect the newt eggs get about as much oxygen as if the algae was not there, but I confess I\u2019m not an expert in aquatic oxygen diffusion.  I presume they grow much more during the day and slow down at night when the supplemental oxygen disappears.",

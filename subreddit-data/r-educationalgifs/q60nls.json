I suspect you either went to a bad place or, even more likely, Mexican churros kind of shaped your impression of churros, so when you encountered something different, you couldn't enjoy it. I'm in the opposite shoes: I grew up with Spanish churros, which I think are awesome, but I just can't appreciate Mexican churros. They're just...blah. To me. I think to get a truly neutral view you'd have to serve both types, freshly made, to someone who had *never* had churros of *either* kind. And then repeat that with maybe 100 people to get a good base sample size.",

That first roll we see pulled off the oil I would just bin, way, waaaay too toasted.\n\nChurros come in several styles without counting quasichurros like porras. While the dough's ingredients mostly remain consistent, how wet the dough is Will determine how your churros end up.\n\nBasically you have two schools, thick and extra crunchy with little to no soft interior, waffle-like if you must and longer, laced churros with a softer, sometimes almost custardy inner side. The churros on the v\u00eddeo are rolled and then cut, which is more common on the Middle/South of Spain.\n\nThe churros must be fried in olive oil, changed frequently, the dough is extremely sensible to oil quality. \n\nChurros are savoury, however almost everybody have them sweet, with some vigorous shakes of white sugar. The almost universal pairing is with Hot, dark, spoon-breaking chocolate but coffee is also universally loved.\n\nOur South American brothers make them with a thick style but fill them with crazy things. They are tasty but almost a dessert on itself and not the perfect vehicle to dip on your coffee churros should be.\n\nBut by Crom, filled with dulce de leche they are the food for the food gods.",

When they sell everything (they normally do), or when it\u2019s noon, they close, and don\u2019t open in the evening. I\u2019ve never seen a churrer\u00eda open past 12:00pm, except the ones they park at public places during the winter, that also make fries, and you can smell the oil from a couple blocks away, the traditional \u201cfritanga\u201d!",

It is run by a traditional family, I know two of the grandkids and one year they gave me a tour and invited me to a txupito. One year I was working as a cleaning guy in that street and they invited me and the cleaning crew to some churros. Great people all around.",

The tarantula has a slow march, and is vulnerable and easy prey. I like  to watch out for their safe passages. (It takes forever.) The wasp looks like Satan, black and red and its stinger is pure evil.\nThis, I know, because I was bitten by one. I can\u2019t describe the shock, pain and temporary madness. It lasted for hours and now I know why they say when someone gets bit by the tarantula wasp, put the person in a room down the hall and shut the door!",

Rods are good for high contrast, but do not provide colour, and cones are the opposite, providing colour to our vision while performing poorly in low light.     \n\n\nOur colour vision is limited compared to other animals ie:fewer cones, but the tradeoff is an increase in rods, and better night vision.",

Maybe some cetaceans could do it too but as far as I know, it's just speculation.\n\nHere's how it works: Make it so that they have to go for, say, the one LEFT of the pink one. Depending on the animal they can do a colored one or the left one. But only humans have the ability to associate the two concepts, color and direction.\n\nSo if you moved around the circles making sure to always put a circle(color doesn't matter for this one) left of the pink one (relative to the animal) they wouldn't be able to do it.\n\nBut the best part is that it seems that the reason WE can do it is because our brains can do speech! Meaning when we are associating concepts, we do it with the same brain areas the we use for speech. When we are linking ideas, the brain is speaking to itself. Proof of this is that if a person is asked to repeat the words of a recording they play for them at the SAME TIME they are trying to find the LEFT of the pink one, they will only do so if they stop repeating the words for a brief moment. The brain cannot connect two REAL things unless it can talk to itself!\n\n\n\nThis has profound implications too! It may be the explanation for the mechanism of how we can alter our memories, or lie to ourselves. How the brain defines reality may be the speech center describing, to itself, what is happening... to the best of its abilities.\n\nIn other words, it tells itself only something it can understand. If a person is not aware of its probable ignorance, it will build a story-reality that does not involve the possibility of not understanding. Or if the person overestimates their own ignorance, they will frequently tell themselves story-realities they never feel certain of.",

Usually we'll use a token board system and then clients earn tokens for completing trials, and after you earn 8 tokens we can go to the gym. \n\nAs far as the learned helplessness, if you're using proper reinforcement/praising and have basic mental health knowledge and in a controlled environment that shouldn't be a thing",

                    "comment": "The field used to be called behaviorism, then behavior modification, and now applied behavioral analysis. \n\nWe have come a long way from Skinner.\n\nTwo things I'd like to point out: \n\nLinking a reinforcement and a punishment (not really possible) is not the best way to teach behaviors, we know that reinforcement is by far the most effective. At this stage of the field punishment is generally (not always) viewed as an approach that is taken when a program revolving around reinforcement is difficult to implement. \n\nSecond:\n\n&gt;This is half of the experience, but basically, this is how you can train a living being to do specific things (touching one color) avoid specific behavior ( touching other colors).\n\nTouching one color is not the avoidance of other colors, I know that seems counter intuitive. Avoidance is a specific kind of behavior where a warning stimulus signals that something you don't like is about to happen. Ex: a rat is standing on a platform. Every time a sound plays, a second later the rat is shocked, over time the rat will learn to respond to the sound so it can avoid the shock. \n\nIn the case of pecking pink and not other colors the pigeon isn't avoiding anything, it just knows that it only gets reinforcement if it pecks the pink. I know it's nitpicky but I thought that was interesting. If anybody has any questions about ABA I'm always willing to answer.",

I personally like to wait for given behaviors after I set up an antecedent but it also has its flaws, like a dog not figuring out how to target with his paws, only nose lol",

I had major apnea and my test results showed that I regularly stopped breathing for between 30-45 seconds throughout the night.\n\nMy first week using the machine left me feeling like I was in puberty again, incredible. If I don't wear it it feels like I'm hung over from a night of drinking and I think about how I felt like that every day and just assumed it was normal.\n\nI would highly, HIGHLY recommend that anyone who snores, has a sleep disorder or wakes up feeling like shit to get tested. Not only is your heart at major risk, your mental health and overall physical health is also impacted majorly.",

Typically you wear it for a few nights then return it to the clinic for them to review the results, these days they can even monitor it remotely. It's kinda uncomfortable but if you've got apnea usually you're tired as fuck anyway and nothing will keep you from sleeping.\n\nYour doctor may also choose to do a sleep study in a clinic but I think that's pretty rare now.",

My work days required all my energy and I often found it difficult to think clearly past 3PM. \n\nAfter work when driving back home, a 1h30 drive, I had to stop in parking lots half way to do a power nap cause I was falling asleep at the wheel. \n\nDuring weekends my girlfriend would wake me up at 11h and if I sat on the couch at 1PM I would fall asleep until 4PM. I felt like a lazy piece of shit cause every little damn thing seemed like a mountain and I didn't have the energy for it.\n\nMy gf had told me for a while she believed I had sleep apnea. One night, she woke up and  thought I was dead as I didn't breath for so long. She was so scared she says she touched me to see if I was still warm. Afterward, she ended up filming me in my sleep and \"forcing\" me to take an appointment with my doctor to get tested.\n\nThe results came in and showed I had severe obtrusive sleep apnea with over 45 events per minutes.\n\nI was lucky that I adapted to the cpap in a week or two, some people never do.  I now can't even take a nap without it. For the first few weeks I had such crazy dreams, it was weird as I hadn't dreamed since years!\n\nTo anyone on the fence about getting tested I'd say do it. I was so exhausted all the time that simply making the appointment and going was a chore, but I am so glad I did. I now have a normal energy level, no more headaches in the morning, I feel like I can think like I used to when I was 20, etc.",

And the straps across your cheeks are covered in fabric. It's as comfy as a side sleeper mask is gonna get. There's also an under the nose piece you can swap out instead of the nasal pillows.

The below is an exceprt from an interview with the team who discovered this phenomene. Ill link the artical below as well.\n\n\"The team believes that when neurons switch off during sleep, they need less oxygen, which leads to blood draining from the brain. This, in turn, means that pressure in the brain also drops, and so the cerebrospinal fluid needs to increase, so as to maintain normal pressure in the absence of blood.\"\n\nSo if we were to attempt to make the brain clean while in anawakened state, it may over pressurize the brain cavity which could cause a wide number of harmful, or even lethal, side effects.\n\nInterview Article\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326896#A-complex-synchronization-process\n\nFull Journal Publication\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440",

They are the second smallest baleen whale after the pygmy right whale.\n\nOrcas have their own regional \"dialects\" that they use to communicate with eachother. This could mean that orcas from different parts of the world could have difficulty communicating with eachother.\n\nSperm whales have the largest brain of any animal species and is also the largest toothed whale/predator. They only have teeth on their bottom jaw which fit into sockets in its upper jaw. This is ok though because, like all cetaceans, sperm whales swallow their prey whole.\n\nWhales used to live on land. They evolved from quadrupeds meaning they used to have 4 legs. Some complete skeletons show evidence of their back legs which consists of the remnants of their pelvis near the end of their tails.\n\nBelugas are able to change the shapes of their head (called a melon).\n\nNarwhal tusks are actually just really long teeth. Usually, they only grow one on one side of their face (usually the left) but some of them grow two. Their tusks actually have sensory capabilities and can grow up to 3 meters long.\n\nWhales have hair just like all mammals do.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my whale facts!!",

It needs blood to function, so it is using a sort of \"zone defense\" in the sense that parts of your brain are getting blood to keep the heart pumping and parts of your brain are getting flushed. Sleeping is a way of putting yourself in stasis so that it can systematically do this. It's like a \"low power mode\" that in part is easier to manage because of the lower heart rate and breathing rate associated with sleeping.\n\nI believe it would have more to do with how this inhibits your ability to function while awake than anything else, if I am understanding it correctly. Not being able to use your brain fully in an emergency would be problematic, and some of the \"toxins\" would be build up for hormones and other things that are circulated through your blood stream.",

The rest is using the \"bandwidth\" provided by your entire brain to do all of that for you.\n\nWhen you go to sleep, a few things happens.\n\nFirst, your ability to move is shut down - when this fails you get sleepwalking. Not moving not only limits how much energy your body is using, it also prevents you from falling out of bed or acting out your dreams. In fact, when people wake up they sometimes experience \"sleep paralysis\" which is basically just the time between your ability to move returning after you have awakened.\n\nBecause your ability to move is shut down, you don't need to breathe as much, and your heart doesn't need to pump as quickly. Each contraction of the heart requires some neurons to be firing as well as each breath you take. \n\nYour body temperature also drops when you sleep - so again, less energy is being expended and your brain doesn't have to put as many resources towards maintaining your core body temperature (which is why your fingers and toes may be cold when you first wake up in the morning).\n\nWhile your senses may still \"work\", you aren't consciously monitoring them. Your eyes are closed, so they don't need as much blood, etc. You basically just have less information being processed.\n\nThe long and short of it though is that you just have less going on while you are asleep, your body is using less energy, and the blood through your veins is moving less quickly. So the bandwidth that your brain would normally need to function while you are awake is much, much lower. That makes it the perfect opportunity to sort of \"shut down\" one side and replace the blood there with cerebral spinal fluid...",

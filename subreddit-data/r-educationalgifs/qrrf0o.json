She was dead serious too. After our incredulous laughter died, all 4 people at my table began telling her at once who Tommy LaSorda was, and I remember the phrase \"fat old man\" coming out at full volume (we were seated outside, but still) before I launched into the SlimFast commercial bit about \"a delicious shake for breakfast, one for lunch, and then a healthy dinner...even pasta\"! By the time I get the last part out, I'm practically yelling, but everyone else had gone dead silent. I looked around and saw a fat old man seated a few tables away, wearing the exact same blue striped polo shirt I happened to be wearing. It was the real Tommy LaSorda, and he...looked...PISSED. So did the half-dozen ballplayer-looking dudes at his table. They didn't have any idea we were mocking the poor dude by accident, and they'd never believe it wasnt intentional anyway. Fortunately, they were just getting up to leave, and we didn't run into them in the parking lot.",

I guess I could've realized that from the original video.",

Some still got through but it was usually due to operator error.",

You can also literally get compaines to put whatever they want on the bearing.  So your ABEC 7, or 10's were probably really at the most a 3 and the guy who sold them to you laughed all the way to the bank.  Even if you had legit hi-precision bearings, they're made to run under a radial load, so when you use them in a wheel which will use radial and axial load, you're not getting the advantage of having a more precisely, more \"round\" machined bearing.",

They tend to contain a lubricant to reduce friction.\n\nOver time the balls can wear out of shape, crack or rust, the race can wear a channel on the middle where the balls rub or the lubricant get displaced by dirt and mud. Anyone who's had an old bike will know how ineffective they can become.",

However, every bearing has a load rating, if you exceed that load rating, friction is much more of a concern because the bearings will heat up and either break or lock up\n\nEdit: I realize you\u2019re talking about the cage now. The cage is more there for maintaining the position. It\u2019s not contacting the balls by much at all. They\u2019re kind of floating inside of it. The races (the rings) are the contact points",

But how?\n\nBefore roller or ball bearings the solution used to be that the car had large pads that would would sit [directly on the axle, inside of boxes filled with oil and rags](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WZoI7MBRUx4/WUZSsqOsHsI/AAAAAAAAurw/v9HZu0ol6-cgQHERb3PshZWSUCBnE5BNgCLcBGAs/s1600/2.jpg) to try to keep the axle and large pad lubricated. The oil needed to be there to prevent to cut down on friction between the pad and the axle. This *mostly* worked so long as it didn't get too hot or the oil didn't boil off.\n\nUnfortulately, they regularly did dry up and then would QUICKLY heat up and [catch fire](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gBnpNzWDVfo/XE_FYTLuoEI/AAAAAAABTZw/aXeQR5R6te0i6JQuCNjhe74k_PoI8zVigCLcBGAs/s1600/50714499_10212157198279720_7076931967123456000_n.jpg).\n\nWhat roller / ball bearings do is allow us to eliminate that source of friction. With them we can connect a rotating axle to a relatively stationary machine without any friction between them. So they're used **everywhere**.",

All four wheels have them; the inner ring, called a race iirc, its tightly over the spindle, which is connected to the steering and/or suspension components, and the outer race fits tightly inside the wheel hub, which is what the lug nuts and rotor are mounted to. There's also one in the pulley on your AC compressor. This a!lows the pulley to spin freely without turning the compressor when when the AC is not in use, and when it is on a magnetic clutch causes the bearing to be bypassed so the compressor can turn.",

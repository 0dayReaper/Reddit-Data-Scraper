I had one person tell me that Alaska has \u201cbad vibes\u201d and she\u2019d never go there because it\u2019s like a northern land based version of the Bermuda Triangle. I also had a recording on my answering machine from a telemarketer who forgot to disconnect, got to hear him and his coworker going on about how Alaskans never answer their calls, and they decided it\u2019s because Alaska is huge and people spend 6-8 hours commuting every day.\n\nEvery one of those ideas was from an actual instance with a fellow American, or was something I heard people say off and on over the years. I could see some of them as stereotypes or grains of truth just taken to an extreme, but some are straight up head scratchers.",

Some are very useful, like Universal Transverse Mercator is very used in Engineering as it allows measuring distance in meters as long as your area of interest isn't that large, some others allow you to measure distances directly from some center point even for long distances, others allow measuring areas, and so on.\n\nGoogle and others use Mercator or some variants because while it does not keep areas correct relative to each other, on the other hand it is a conformal projection. That means in close up views it keeps angles and the general shape of things mostly like real life, which is nice for navigation, that includes not only boats as the meme goes, but also cars.",

The western world is closer to the pole than other parts of the world, so it appears larger and takes up more space. That the design puts the atlantic ocean at the center of the map doesn't help. It's not a conscious effect, but what you put at the center of the map and how certain things scale does effect how we think of them.\n\nOf course, Mercator himself knew his map was mostly only useful for navigation. He was a proponent for some kind of equal area map as the definitive world map. And the problem with schools calling the Mercator map racist was more about how they tried to replace the Mercator with the Peters projection, which sucks even larger balls. \n\nThere's nothing memetic about teaching kids how even the most basic components of our knowledge can have an effect on how they perceive things. It's good to think like that from a young age. If the school described their endeavor to the media as teaching kids how we can't have a perfect understanding of our globe and how map design is politically influenced, it wouldn't have been such a stink. \n\nAs an aside, the [authagrapgh projection](https://decolonialatlas.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/authagraph-countries-map.jpg) is my favorite projection. It's mostly equal area, it preserves the shapes of regions decently enough, it most prominently features the pacific ocean, and it displays Antarctica truthfully. Best part though is that it can be tiled on any side with no seam, meaning it can be used to map things like continuous orbits.",

As stated, you can't map the surface of a sphere onto a rectangle without some distortion somewhere.\n\nSo why do we use the Mercater projection? Well, what's the primary purpose for maps in general? Navigation. This projection preserves relative angles, which is extremely useful for navigation, especially at sea. There are other projections that do a better job of showing area comparisons, but they sacrifice directional accuracy for it. This one is the best for navigation, which is why maps exist at all, and so that's why it's so popular. ",

The book itself looks shrinked because the web viewer is not properly scaled to allow it to fit (the aspect ratio was similar to 16:9). Browsing through it you see Goode's Homolsine, Wagner VII and ortographic projections. It was also very common to use blank world map sheets to learn to identify countries or specific regions. These were commonly called _mapamundi_, and normally were presented in the Mercator or Robinson projection.",

It is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians.\n    \nThe two properties, conformality and straight rhumb lines, make this projection uniquely suited to marine navigation: courses and bearings are measured using wind roses or protractors, and the corresponding directions are easily transferred from point to point, on the map, with the help of a parallel ruler or a pair of navigational protractor triangles.",

What you\u2019re hearing now is me paraphrasing him from memory. I just bought this one because it was quiet. \n\nThe answer is...[LG direct drive washing machines](https://www.lg.com/uk/6-motion-dd-washing-machines). They\u2019re different to most in that they use magnets rather than a belt. The analogy he gave was to a record player - you used to get cheap belt driven ones that would always slip and break eventually, or more expensive magnetic ones that kept constant rotation. \n\nThe magnetic ones are also more quiet, and if you follow my link you\u2019ll see it describes every one of the motions that OP\u2019s post shows and tells you which cycle they\u2019ll be used in. \n\nSo yep. LG Direct Drive apparently. Must say mine has been quiet, reliable and generally great.",

It\u2019s a huge washer, which is misleading because if you put more than 3 pairs of jeans in it they don\u2019t get wet and they certainly don\u2019t get clean, because it adds just a tiny amount of water and then kind of shakes it around a bit. Forget washing large blankets, they have to take those to the cleaners now. I\u2019ve tried tricking it into filling with more water by soaking beach towels in water and adding those to the wash to add extra weight but it doesn\u2019t work. The only mode it will fill the washer up on is \u201ctub clean\u201d but if it senses any laundry weight in it while on that mode it will shut off. Meanwhile I have a front loader that is going on 10 years old and it has no problem washing any of my heavy winter blankets. But my mom still thinks that front loaders are complete garbage and that no matter what top loaders are better.",

If they really were as smelly and as problematic as some people in this comment section seem to think they are, I'm pretty sure people would have switched to the top loaders instead.\n\nI just tried to see if you could even buy top loaders here in the UK. You can but they're harder to find and more expensive than front loaders. I suspect that peoples preference of washing machine type is less about which is better and more about price and social norms (plus which one fits in your house. Most UK homes were built before washing machines meaning house had to be retrofitted. The washing machines went wherever there was already plumbing, meaning they went in the Kitchens. Front loaders make way more sense when you're putting it under a kitchen counter)",

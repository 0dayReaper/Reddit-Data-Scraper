Every five minutes, I will move your chair to a position halfway between its current location and the woman on the bed.\" The mathematician looks at the psychologist in disgust. \"What? I'm not going to go through this. You know I'll never reach the bed!\" And he gets up and storms out. The psychologist makes a note on his clipboard and ushers the engineer in.\n\nHe explains the situation, and the engineer's eyes light up and he starts drooling. The psychologist is a bit confused. \"Don't you realize that you'll never reach her?\"\n\nThe engineer smiles and replied, \"Of course! But in less than half an hour, I'll be close enough for all practical purposes!\"",

Can't have people climbing on me or they risk falling to their death. Can't really touch normal sized people because I could crush them with my finger tip. \n\nI wasn't expecting to be able to do *much* but it seems like I could realistically do nothing with normal people safely.\n\nMan, I no longer wish to be 500 feet tall.",

They go up to about 50-60MPa but have very small aggregate so that they can have a small minimum thickness.",

It is safe, less labor intensive and overall a new construction method for building bridges.\n\nFor the ramps, a new construction method is the use of MSE walls (mechanically stabilized embankment walls). This also avoids having to cast in place concrete walls to avoid the labor intensive job or forming these walls and pouring them all at the same time. The MSE walls are designed so that concrete panels are holding back the soils (these look like the puzzle pieces on the side of ramps leading the the bridge\u2019s span).",

We want to minimize the number of compressions missed, but also move the patient quickly because as they say in cardiology, \"time is (heart) muscle.\" The LUCAS is amazing because it allows us to move the patient without missing a single compression, meaning they get more consistent compressions over a shorter time to the hospital",

The person and the paramedics were surprised when I told them what just occurred. \n\nThe person was agonal breathing when I arrived so I didn\u2019t expect a good outcome. They were in really good shape though so maybe my compressions were a little weak but was enough for them specifically since they were pretty healthy otherwise. \n\nThe paramedics contacted me later and said that it was determined that the compressions saved the persons life. \n\nNot trying to talk about myself. I just really want anyone reading this to not be afraid of CPR and want to share my experience. \n\nRecent information I\u2019ve found is that breaking ribs occurs around 30% of the time and cartilage separating is very common and I\u2019m fairly certain that\u2019s what happened. Also, for anyone reading, it\u2019s still recomnended to continue compressions even if it is suspected that a rib is broken. \n\nFinal note, best thing to do is to get trained in at least compressions only CPR and how to use an AED. Can lead to saving a life. \n\n\nhttps://www.primemedicaltraining.com/does-cpr-break-ribs/",

Well done for saving a life!",

Even if they don\u2019t qualify to have osteoporosis, the bones will still be more brittle. You will occasionally even feel the broken ends grinding together when doing compressions. You just need to get over it and continue. But also yes, the cartilage can make snap sounds, again more likely in older patients, unlikely in children.",

I did CPR training at work but knew just how forceful the compressions should be (probably from reading about it on Reddit).\n\nAfter seeing everyone else doing these weak ass pushes on the dummy, I asked the instructor about breaking ribs so that people finally understood you really need to give'r. This should be made way more explicit as many people would think breaking bones was bad when in fact it informs you of just how much force you should really apply.",

Rhythms that are \"shock-able\", meaning able to be defibrillated, are irregular rhythms that cause the heart to beat in erratic ways. The electricity applied \"knocks out\" the erratic electrical activity and allows for the heart's normal pacemaker cells to take over and go into a perfusable rhythm. A major healthcare pet peeve is medical shows that have providers shocking the flat line on the monitor, as that is one that does not respond to the reset mentioned above as there is no electrical activity in the heart. Sometimes that flat line rhythm can respond to certain cardiac drugs (eg. Epinephrine) but not always.",

Usually that would be because you get the heart pumping again which restores coronary circulation, the blood that supplies the heart itself, which gets it going. The success rates are low, but that goes for all cpr. Any time I've ever done cpr, it was the compressions that restored the pulse, not a defibrillator. The pulse that comes back is often garbage and doesn't have a good rhythm, at which point you may need to shock it, as one of the people above said.",

Usually it was a dose (or 10) of naloxone and then CPR until EMTs arrived but one time I didn't have naloxone on me. Somehow they came to (woke up) shortly before the EMTs arrived, then fell out again and were revived by the paramedics. They lived, but unfortunately died years later of an OD. I wasn't there that time. \n\nEvery time was absolutely terrifying. I have no idea if it was me that saved them or the naloxone, or a combination. I found one girl in the bathroom after I had passed out and to this day I have no idea how long she  had passed until I found her, but im guessing about 20-45 min. Everything is my head told me she was not gonna live but thank fuck she's alive and well today, and sober! She came to about a minute after jabbing her with naloxone and performing CPR. I did it so hard her chest was black and blue for weeks. \n\nShit like that keeps me up at night.",

Opioid cause respiratory depression, meaning you respiratory rate can drop to effectively nill in an overdose, but your heart can still beat. Everything else works normally until that tissue runs out of oxygen which can take some time depending on the organ. Narcan completely reverses that by blocking opioid receptors. So some of the people you knew may have had a heart beat but they weren't breathing. Then they got narcan, starting breathing and it fixed the issue and they seemed instantly good. Narcans an amazing drug although it can have its side effects. You've never experienced projectile vomiting until you've seen a long time user get 4mg slammed up their nose and put instantly into withdrawals.",

It is effective for sudden cardiac arrest where there is still oxygen in the body to be circulated.  CPR with breaths is equally effective in that situation, but is better for other types of cardiac arrest where there isn't enough oxygen, such as from respiratory failure due to drowning, drugs, or choking. It's also better if you don't know how long the person has been down.",

If you are doing cpr get in a position so you are almost over the person. You want your shoulders directly over your hands and arms straight, so you are pushing straight down. It is less tiring and makes it easier to push down. \n\nAlso you need to push deeper than this. Aiming for one third the depth of the chest \n\nFinally an additional part. If you are doing this in a public place, get someone or multiple peopleto look around and see if anywhere has an automated defibrillator. The sooner someone is defibbed (if it\u2019s suitable to do it) the more likely it is to work. A lot of places have these automated defibs (AEDs) now. Supermarkets, schools, other shops, leisure centres.\n\nMy parents lawn bowls club has just been donated one. Apparently loads of people didn\u2019t want it there. I had \u201ca word\u201d with my parents (told them to get their act together and take it) and not only did they accept it, but got someone into teach everyone how to do CPR, and most people really enjoyed it.",

Sometimes we would get a pulse back during treatment and in the ambulance , even in to the ER but they couldn't hold on. Too much down time too much damage whatever the reason.  Twice in my career did I get to meet a patient we had saved. One came to after we had shocked him.  Another time I shocked a guy nine times with our (back in the day) new AED. Sparks started flying out from under one of the patches after about the fifth shock. We did get a pulse back and he had one in the ER but he ended up dying. I cant and don't WANT to remember the number of times I did CPR.\n\nNowadays the have devices that do compression for you. Get on scence start manual CPR. Ambulance arrives and they set up the CPR device. The one we used in the last few years was called the Autopulse. Search youtube for it. It does excellent compressions, is easier on the manpower, much better than a firefighter can give consistent compressions.",

Early on we thought that there was almost no chance that he would survive or that he would have fairly significant loss of quality of life. The human body certainly is a strange thing. I have also performed CPR way too many times, but I cannot imagine how difficult it would be in the field. Major props to you on that. The automated devices are pretty cool! Definitely better to have a robot that is able to give consistent, quality compressions than for a person to. Pretty cool stuff!

This gif shows inadequate compressions.\n\nCompressions are violent and effective when done right.  Often times we get ROSC on a patient and they're left with multiple rib fractures, especially the elderly.",

My dog had a near drowning accident this year and i did chest compressions on her as best I could, got her back from lifeless and blue to conscious and rushed her to the vet ED. I am so, so thankful I learned how to do compressions and I just modified how hard I pushed to accommodate her lil doggie chest. I wasn't even able to really breathe into her airway, it was literally the chest compressions that brought her back from what looked like dead. It was horribly traumatic but she spent a day in doggy ICU recovering on oxygen, no cracked ribs and she is just as nuts and adventurous as she always has been. So thankful \u2665\ufe0f",

If you adjust for size, you don\u2019t get an accurate representation of the other two qualities (shape and distance). The mercator projection shown here prior to size adjustment allows us to understand relative location of countries and their accurate (ish) shape. As soon as size is adjusted, the location is compromised severely.",

One country will be too short in one dimension, another will be too tall.  This is just a product of what happens when you try to represent something that is 3D on a 2D plane.\n\nSo how you make all the pieces fit, is by distorting each piece a little bit.  This is called your projection.  (The one on this gif is a particularly famous reference, the mercator projection) You pick a reference point and say \"ok, everything on my map has to fit this piece\".  Problem is, as you get farther and farther from that reference piece, the more you have to change the new pieces to match up with the reference one.  \n\nThis is why as you get to the poles in the Mercator projection, the countries get so big.  You are very far from the reference and have to distort accordingly",

Unrolling a cylinder on a flat surface still ignores its original curvature, so even by that it doesn't reflect the original with a 100% accuracy. As always, this is just a two-dimensional simplification.",

Decades after I learned about the issues with this type of map, it's still the one I see in my head when thinking geography.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention how making Africa look smaller by comparison minimizes the fact that it's huuuge and has a looot of people. Who also happen to be mostly non-white. Go to Google Earth and look at how big Africa is to everywhere else. The map isn't explicitly racist, but it minimizes the size and impact of the 2nd largest continent (after Eurasia) implicitly, if unintentionally.",

The theorem states that if you deform a shape in a way that preserves distances (we would call the transformation an \"isometry\"), then its gaussian curvature must be the same too (so its \"invariant under isometry\"). A sphere has the same non-zero gaussian curvature at every point, while a flat map has gaussian curvature 0 at every point. So you cant map the sphere to a flat piece of paper without changing some distances. Because if that was possible, then both the sphere and the map would have the same gaussian curvature, which is a contradiction.\n\nI have read that there are simpler ways to go about this, but I only know this one. Plus, theorema egregium is just a really interesting fact. One variation states that we can make out the curvature of an object purely by measuring distances and angles on its surface. We never need to look at it \"from outside\", we can live on its surface and look at our measurements to work out the curvature.",

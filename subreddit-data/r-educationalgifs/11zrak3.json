To Doc\u2019s point. 99% is like a normal day but kinda overcast and the sun is still way to bright to look at directly, but not that interesting with protective glasses - it\u2019s the sun but crescent shaped yay. \n\nIn 100%, day turns to night, you see the corona, it gets cold, you see stars and the moon, the animals and bugs freak out and go silent, the horizon glows like twilight but in every direction. You\u2019re sitting on a rock in outer fucking space.",

But a sharp enough knock to the instrument could cause it to loosen or fall, in which case the top of the violin will slowly collapse under string tension if the post is not replaced.",

The idea is that the Hyde glue is a weaker bond than the wood fibers, so if a force or pressure is exerted on the instrument, the glue/seam will break before the wood cracks. \n\nTaking the instrument apart involves delicately hammering in a knife at the seams to break the hide glue apart. Steam could warp the wood.",

Also, with changes in humidity and temperature the wood needs room to expand and contract. Wood glue should never be used in string instruments for this reason, as it is too strong and has no give, causing the wood to crack as it expands and contracts. Instead, hide glue is used. As seasons change and wood moves, a glued seam might crack open and require reglueing, but that is much preferred to mending cracked wood.\n\n  Furthermore, in extreme cases for cellos and basses, a summer and winter bridge and soundpost might be appropriate due to the changes in tone and action (string height) as the seasons change.",

I ordered the tool from Amazon and decided to do it myself.\n\nWhat a mistake. It took many hours. Getting a sound post through the f-hole is TOUGH, they\u2019re basically made as large as they can be. Then you have to notch the sound post to fit your wedge (the tool you\u2019re using) into it, and push it in far enough where it\u2019s not going to come loose in the cello. And then you have to wedge it into the body of the cello hard enough that it\u2019s going to stay in place, which is tough when you already wedged it into the tool and you have to separate them.\n\nAdd onto that for an untrained person the only way to gauge where the sound post actually is, is to look through the endpin hole. I had a flashlight in one f-hole the tool in the other, and an iPhone camera streaming to a TV through the end pin hole so I could see what was going on like a surgery.\n\nI dropped the sound post multiple times. The procedure for this is to jam it back into the tool and bring it back out through the f-hole and fix it properly. This is very hard to do. I ended up using a fork and knife to balance it on one end and slide it up the f-hole a few times.\n\nOf course only after all that did I realize the strings were supposed to be loose when installing it, and I had to do it all over again.",

Also it might not be in the optimal place but it's good enough. You might not tell even if it's not exactly right on student instruments played by students. Mostly it falls because the students don't remember to check it and straighten it every now and then because tuning can make it tilt.",

Stradivarius violins for example cost millions because only around 1000 were built ever and they\u2019re centuries old. It has nothing to do with how structurally sound they are or how complicated engineering wise they are to build and manufacture. It\u2019s actually funny because violins are very simple instruments design wise. It\u2019s simply acoustics, not kind more complicated than a guitar. An instrument like a French or a baritone is much more complicated. They have to be manufactured and designed in a way so that the tubes are the right size and have the right resonance to produce certain tones when you push down the keys. You probably have no idea what I\u2019m talking about even. But for baritones with 4 valves there\u2019s so many combinations of notes to make, pushing down certain valves will open and close other tubes to make a precise pitch. The 4th valve will often change the instrument in a way to play lower notes almost like a tuba.  And then there\u2019s other complex instruments like a bassoon or saxophone which have even more keys and tubes as they don\u2019t rely on the tightening of lips to change the pitch. Really to suggest violins are more complex than woodwinds in design and engineering, is laughable.",

It\u2019s not meant for that purpose, it\u2019s meant to keep the instrument from self imploding. The reason it creates a more full sound is because you\u2019re adding vibrating mass to the instrument, but again, that\u2019s not the main purpose. \n\nHe can\u2019t do it \u201cfor long\u201d because it\u2019s simply not a thing you can \u201cdo\u201d as something HAS to be supporting the top of the instrument to prevent it from collapsing. \n\nSure, you can play the instrument or look at it for a couple minutes, but it\u2019ll collapse into itself and essentially self implode because the tension from the strings is essentially trying to snap instrument in half. Without a sound post, you can\u2019t play. \n\nYou COULD however use a different type of wood (pine vs maple vs mahogany) for the sound post to have an effect on the tone of the instrument. Maple is brighter than mahogany which is brighter and than ebony. You also have to consider how soft or hard the wood is. You could hypothetically use a carbon fibre or resin printed sound post and that would also change the overall tone of the instrument. This all to say, you\u2019re not basing your purchase on the material of the sound post, as it doesn\u2019t have a massive impact on sound, and sound posts are sort of a consumable piece of the instrument. They get replaced  as needed. Placement of the soundpost as mentioned by the poster above me will change the sound as well. Which is how you WOULD use it to change the tone if that\u2019s what you wanted. Most players just want a sound post for the structural benefit",

It didn't collapse, though he was worried it would if he left it too long.\n\nSaying he can't do what he did doesn't make any sense. He did it, so it could be done. And he's literally a violin maker, so I suspect he knows a bit about the tolerances of his instruments.\n\nAdding a second soundpost also had an interesting effect that cuts against the idea that it's just adding extra mass. It flattened out the sound in a way that was very similar to no post at all, which makes me wonder if creating two contact points on the back created some sort of interference with the vibrations in the instrument body.",

Also, very good modern instruments do sound (as objectively as possible) better than Strads and Guarneris. That just science and art working together.",

Only when  \n1) all of the strings are loosened, releasing the pressure from the top plate, or  \n2) the instrument experiences a potentially damaging impact.\n\n&gt;The strings exert force upwards of 20kg on the top of the violin\n\nPlease try placing a 25kg weight (balanced on the feet of a violin bridge) on a 2.5mm thick piece of spruce and tell me how long it lasts.\n\nA fallen sound post is not an emergency in and of itself, but it does render the instrument unplayable because the strings absolutely MUST be loosened. Keeping the strings at playing tension would destroy the top without a sound post.",

This requires the post to be changed out\u2014longer in summer and shorter in winter. There is now a carbon fiber post that can adjust almost like a shower rod. \n\nThe issue with carbon fiber is that the fibers run across each other for strength, while a wooden post has fibers running only longitudinally. \n\nStill, the carbon has gotten good results so far. Strength to weight ratio is huge for transferring the vibrations.",

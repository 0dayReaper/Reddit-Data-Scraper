I kind of fell asleep on my phone, but my last moments of lucidity were for this post, OP! &lt;3\n\nNow to clean my honor, I at least gave to bring something interesting and related. The macroscopic angular momentum is one of the (pseudo-)vectors conserved inside a closed system. This can be seen as a variation (but is a consequence) of the 1st and 3rd Newton laws, but for rotations instead of linear movements. For example, in absence of external force, an isolated object will keep its rotation indefinitely; two object acting on one or another will transfer part of their angular momentum to each other, depending on the interaction, so that the vectorial sum always matches the initial value. You can always encase bigger and bigger systems, it will always be the case with some added difficulties (fluids complicate this *a bit*), thus why XKCD made this cute comic about this: https://xkcd.com/162/ which is technically true.\n\nAll in all it allows for the nice experiments we know, from the ballerina\u2019s speed variations depending on how she folds/unfolds her arms, to the guy on a chair with a rotating bike wheel that, when its spin axis is changed, rotates the chair itself to compensate. It\u2019s even a core concept of Kepler\u2019s laws (appears in 2/3 of the usual set of demonstrations for them), in the case of a central force motion (such as the gravity in Newtonian physics) where L= OM \u2227 mv and its time derivative is  dL/dt = OM \u2227 F = 0 (thus undergoes no variation over time).\n\nThe chair guy principle also has its uses. Due to the conservation of that angular momentum, it\u2019s easier to keep an object pointing straight towards a direction if that a. momentum is in the same direction. Hence why some modest sized rockets are launched rotating, making them a bit steadier and least subject to wobble. Then they de-rotate it with that same law, thanks to a simple yo-yo (it transfers the a.m from the rocket to the yo-yo, that then is separated from the rocket). Here\u2019s a little gif about it: [Rocket yo-yo despin](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicsgifs/comments/9sn1nh/how_conservation_of_angular_momentum_can_stop_a/?st=JW4E0EIJ&amp;sh=23e22e6c) \n\nLittle addition, a fun theorem that\u2019s related to rotational dynamics, the [Dzhanibekov](https://m.imgur.com/t/space/aj0Vl)/tennis racket theorem. The behavior is quite unintuitive but is explained with items having 3 moments of inertia. You can try this with your phone (be careful tho :D) as the intermediate axis rotation isn\u2019t stable: hold the phone in front of you, screen pointing towards your face. Grab it at half the height from both sides, one per hand and flip it so the screen faces the ground (rotation towards you) just after launching. Your phone will never come back in the same position, as it always flips itself over along another preferred axis of inertia (1st or 3rd, which are stable contrary to the one you\u2019re forcing the rotation with). It\u2019s even crazier in a micro-gravity frame of reference, but we still can experience it!",

The equations are coupled. A change in radius is dominated by the change in the moment of inertia as it goes to the power of 2. A lower radius lowers both the moment of inertia and increases the angular velocity. However, the *mvr* expression is easier to understand as it breaks down the relationships down to 3 properties you can actively change whereas angular velocity and moment of inertia are, in essence, properties derived from them.\n\n&gt;And the kinetic energy equation shows radius doesn't change it, what other energy woukd change?\n\nNone. Hence the change in ~~rotation/angular~~ linear/tangential speed.",

It would make sense, decrease r by a factor of 2, increase w by a factor of two, but it is not that linear. And it doesn\u2019t have to be linear between r and w, what is saying that it is? \n\nFor example, let\u2019s half the radius of an arbitrary object spinning at w with radius r\n\nm(r/2)^2wf = m(r)^2wi\n\nm(r)^2 /4 wf = m(r)^2 wi \n\n(1/4) wf = wi \n\nwf = 4 wi.\n\nSo decreasing our object that has all of the mass at radius r from the point of rotation by a factor of 2 increases angular velocity by a factor of 4. This is perfectly acceptable. Angular velocity and linear velocity are not constants in these equations, so it doesn\u2019t matter if they change proportional to 1/r or 1/r^2 as long as the product is the same angular momentum is still conserved. \n\nFor your second question, I think you have the same problem. v is not constant between the two situations. By reducing the radius you are doing work and adding energy, the linear speed is increasing. Linear speed is not constant in conservation of angular momentum problems. It\u2019s the same reason above. While v = w/r , decreasing the radius of the object increases linear speed. It\u2019s kind of confusing, as there\u2019s multiple variables all changing here. But what it comes down to \n\nDecreasing the radius of an object that is spinning must increase its angular and linear speed as momentum is conserved. \n\nEnergy is added to the system as both v and w increase after the radius is decreased.\n\nHope I could help.",

This is because conservation of angular momentum (Iw) has to remain constant with no external tangential forces being applied. However, as I decreases when the mass is brought to the centre, w, the angular velocity, increases (Iw stays the same). Rotational kinetic energy is given by (1/2 Iw^2, or 0.5(Iw)w) since Iw is staying the same and w is increasing, the rotational kinetic energy does increase when doing this, and that energy comes from pulling the string down in this",

Moment of inertia is effectively a measure of how hard it is to change the speed an object rotates at and depends on how far the mass of the object is from the axis of rotation and can be complicated to work out.\n\nIn the case of a hollow sphere like in this case, the moment of inertia, I = 2/3mr^2\n\nAs he said angular momentum has to stay the same, and angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia, and rotational velocity, so as he decreases the radius, the moment of inertia decreases.\n\nFor moment of inertia times rotational velocity to remain the same, rotational velocity has to increase.\n\nThere\u2019s no catch, they\u2019re just better at explaining it concisely than I am",

This is not a catch, just a detail that may confuse some people.\n\nFormally, the angular momentum **L** of an object is defined as **L** = **r** X **p** where **r** is the object\u2019s position vector and **p** is its linear momentum. It is worth noting that ||**L**|| = ||**r**|| ||**p**|| sin(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between **r** and **p** (this is the case for any cross product between two vectors).\n\nA consequence of the definition of the cross product X is that the resultant vector (in this case **L**) is perpendicular to the vectors you\u2019re multiplying (**r** and **p**). Another consequence of this is that if **r** and **p** are parallel, then **L** = **0**. This is why it is important to keep in mind that angular momentum is a vector, if we represent our angular momentum as L = rp (or L = I\u03c9) we wouldn\u2019t know if **r** and **p** are parallel (in fact in both representations we\u2019re assuming that **r** and **p** are perpendicular, check the equivalence of ||**L**|| I mentioned if this brings any confusion).\n\nIf we use **\u03c9** := (**r** X **v**)/||**r**||^2 (which is our angular velocity) and **p** = m**v** =&gt; **L** = **r** X m**v** = mr^2 **\u03c9**. The moment of inertia I is defined as mr^2, therefore **L** = I**\u03c9**.\n\nIf no external forces are involved, then **L** is constant (this means that if **L** = (Lx,Ly,Lz) then Lx, Ly and Lz are constant). Therefore if the radius of the object in question decreases (and thus I decreases) then ||**\u03c9**|| must increase and viceversa. From our definition of **\u03c9** we see that ||**v**|| must increase if ||**\u03c9**|| increases, so the speed at which our object rotates (which is ||**\u03c9**|| NOT **\u03c9**) increases.\n\nIf this was the \u201ckind of\u201d the other response was referring to, I hope I made a good explanation of it.",

(unfortunately, this 5 year old will need to understand that an object in motion stays in motion [at the same speed] unless acted on by an outside force. I have neither the time nor the inclination to break down that law to a 5 year old.) \n\nLet's look at a piece of the structure on the outside of the sphere. Let's pretend it travels 1 meter every second when the sphere is big. Let's imagine that that means it makes one full rotation every second. That means the sphere has a circumference (distance traveled for one rotation) of 1 meter. \n\nNow let's make the circumference (distance travelled for each rotation) half as big. The piece we're looking at is still moving at 1 meter per second, but now it only has to travel half a meter for every rotation. That means the piece we're observing now makes 2 rotations every second, which covers the same distance every second (1 meter), but makes twice as many rotations because each rotation is half as big as it used to be.\n\nThat's why it rotates faster. Each piece of the sphere is moving at the same speed it initially did, but now it has less distance to cover for each rotation, which means each rotation happens faster.",

Conservation means that momentum is always the same even when one of those things change, so, when he first makes the ball turn he applies a force and it spins slowly, but as the ball gets smaller that same force can turn it quicker (because it's easier to spin a small ball than a big ball) so it speeds up.",

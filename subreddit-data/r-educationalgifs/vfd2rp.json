Also by using straps they keep the pine sap and other nasties off your main rope and hammock. I throw my straps in a plastic bag to keep them from getting sap on anything else.  \nI like to suspend everything off the ground when I am camping so I setup a bunch of lines around camp and then just hang all items off the ropes. This can also bite in and damage the tree since gear can be heavy. An alternative in this case to straps is you can insert twigs between the rope and the trunk before you fully tighten. The twigs will distribute the load and keep the rope from eating into the tree.  \nThere are alot of awesome systems out there for rigging but they can be heavy or bulky for me. The UCR knot is practically no weight or bulk and is infinitely adjustable. Strap wrapped around tree, connected to loop on the end of UCR rigging using a marlin spike is what I do when I am pack or kayak camping.",

If I had to describe it with line in both hands cross the line in your right hand over left making a circle, then in your right hand take what portion you want to make the loop with and put that through and pull tight. Then all set can wrap it around whatever you need and pull tight and when done releases the tension easy.",

Learning a square knot, a slip knot, a half hitch, and a cleat hitch (all pretty basic knots, some of which you may have already made without knowing what they're called) will teach you a lot of the pieces you need to make more complicated stuff.\n\nAdd in a bowline, and rope starts to be super useful to have around.\n\nFor example: a \"truckers hitch\" is actually what you get when you tie a bowline, run the slack end of the rope around an anchor &amp; through the bowline, then secure it with a half hitch or two. This knot is super useful because it gets you some mechanical advantage, like if you were using a pulley system or a ratchet strap.\n\nBasic knots are like lego blocks. Complicated knots are usually a useful mix of those smaller knots.",

You can't just practice the idea of it a few times with a guide until you know how to do it, you've gotta get muscle memory by practicing it periodically until you can do it without even thinking. Good way to do this is to do it 50 times on one day until you can do it with your eyes closed, and then keep it fresh by practicing every day, then after a while go down to like once a week, again practicing until you can do it without thinking. After a few weeks you'll notice that you're getting better at retrieving the memory and eventually you'll only need to do it once a month to keep it \"fresh,\" and after a few months it'll just take a few times a year. Once you get to that point, it'll basically be stuck. I can play some pieces that I learned on piano when I was 5 years old twenty years later even though I barely play at all anymore, because I practiced them periodically throughout my childhood and they essentially got stuck in my hands.",

Now the clove hitch is like the ultimate knot especially when locked off with extra half hitches. When you are tying a ton of knots the chance you make this combo is pretty high and thus you have pretty much the best tie off knot known to man.",

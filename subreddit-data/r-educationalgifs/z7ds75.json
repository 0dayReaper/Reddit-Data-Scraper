I thought it was pretty hilarious but I\u2019m sure some people wouldnt find it quite so funny. \n\nPs: for those who dont know, if the parents have incompatible blood types, there can be complications and there are steps they can take to preven those if they know in advance. Our doc told us she\u2019d been bitten too often by the spouse lying about the father that she just gave up and now asked super bluntly about it and gave the women at least 3 easy way to tell her who the real dad is without the husband knowing.",

The specific combination that's problematic is when the mom has negative blood and the baby has positive, because the mom's immune system reads the positive blood as an intruder and attacks the baby.  That can happen, but isn't guaranteed, if the dad has positive blood, so that's the combination they look out for. Or, like my doctor, they proactively treat every woman with negative blood just in case.",

If you get Plasma with the same \"type\" as your RBCs (and vice versa) your blood clumps up and youre up shit creek. This is also how your blood type is determined, your blood + anti-A,B,AB and D(rhesus).  Interesting stuff!",

There are countless different bloodtype-systems which *can* be relevant to transfusions. The Rhesus system (the Rhesus D antigen \"decides\" if youre + or -) alone consist of 65+ known antigens... and against each of those a patient *could* form antibodies which can cause dangerous transfusion reactions. And there are many other antigen-systems like Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNS, Lewis, Diego, Colton and many many more, each with multiple potentially relevant antigens. But luckily most people never form antibodies against those antigens and thous its not an issue for them. Some patients however do require very specific antigens or theyll react to the blood.",

The mechanism is simple:\n\n* Blood cells have little tags on them made of sugars or proteins that are called \"antigens.\"\n* There are three main antigens that affect blood compatibility: the A, the B, and the rh. If someone's blood type has the letter A or B in it, they have that antigen; if it has the \"+\" at the end, they have the rh antigen. If they are O-, their blood has no antigens.\n* If you get a blood donation, your immune system sees the presence of any antigen that it doesn't know about as a red flag, and it attacks the donated blood, leading to a really dangeorus result for you.\n\nThat's it. That is why blood that has none of these three antigens (which we call \"O-\" blood according to our code) is \"universal donor\" blood, but the person with that blood type can't accept anything *except* O- blood, since their blood doesn't have any antigens and their immune system rejects all antigens. Conversely, that is why AB+ is the universal acceptor; they have all three of the antigens, so they can roll with donated blood that has any, all, or none of them; however, their donated blood is much less useful, since it has all three antigens, the only people who can accept it are those with the AB+ blood type.",

My teacher had water with red food coloring, water with blue food coloring, water with red and blue food coloring (aka purple), and plain water. The red water was type A, blue was type B, purple was type AB, and plain water was O. Basically the rule was if you added any of the water to another and it didn't change the color then that blood type could receive from that type. So pouring plain water in any of the others (type O) worked and was a universal donor versus pouring blue water in the red would change it so it was incompatible. We didn't tackle + or - but it was a good experiment for middle schoolers and I still remember it over 20 years later.",

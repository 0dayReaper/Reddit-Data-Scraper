Prepackaged run $5-8 per set,  hand made are $15-20 per string set.",

More tension makes the core wire bend, which can cause wrapping errors.  The wrap wire is also smooth and not moving very fast as it comes off the spool.  The finger under the core is just there to reduce vibrations in the core wire, also helping to prevent wrapping errors.  People who make their own vape coils use this exact same process.",

It'll tear and wind the foil, possibly creating a whipping tail that will be shorter than the starting foil length. That whipping tail still doesn't have any mass behind it though, so the only dangers are getting caught and pulled in or it creating a cutting edge. Both are unlikely as the foil would either tear or crumple.\n\nIf either of those are still a concern, then you shouldn't be around this machine at all. A snapped wire is way more dangerous than any foil thimble could possibly be.",

This is because advancements in string winding tech have made it possible to get 9s, but it used to be you could only get 11s or 12s. (diameter of the skinniest string in thousandths of an inch) which required 4 wound and 2 plain strings. And because the wound strings are quieter to the magnetic pickup; using modern strings on an old fender guitar with the original pickups can cause the G string to be overly loud and unbalanced! I just love how something as seemingly inconsequential as \"industrial processes for making metal wire\" can go on to influence the sound of an instrument so substantially.",

Those fields interact with the earth's magnetic field and some of those field lines end up being broken open. They reconstitute themselves once the particles move on though, so it doesn't really matter.\n\nIt's worth noting that the average aurora-causing event isn't nearly as powerful as what this gif is implying. The earth's magnetic field has a strength of around 30,000-50,000 nT, whereas your average solar wind has a field intensity of \\~2-5nT.",

The solar wind basically stripped earth's magnetic field and started inducing currents in conductors on earth. There were reports of telegraph lines sparking and starting fires, but ultimately it didn't do anything super bad to the planet or life on it. Supposedly, you were able to see aurora borealis as far south as the Carribean, and they were bright enough to wake gold miners up at night in the rocky mountains!\n\n Nowadays with all the electronics we have it might cause more issues, like blackouts and damage to the power grid. The good news is that there are lots of scientists who are watching the sun very closely, so we'd have a good deal of warning before another event like that occurs.\n\nIf Earth didn't have any magnetosphere at all for a long time (many hundreds of thousands of years) then its atmosphere would eventually get stripped away, but for brief periods like we get from time to time it's not really anything to worry about.",

There's all sorts of wacky stuff going on up there, like electron exchange between earth's ionosphere and the solar wind as it's funneled around earth's magnetic field, but most of the light you would see is probably from particle collisions. \n\nWhen a molecule is hit, one of its electrons will absorb energy and enter an excited state before dropping back down and emitting a photon of a certain color. Most of the green color you see in Earth's auroras come from atomic oxygen, with a bunch of blue shades coming from atomic and ionized nitrogen.",

This causes a reduction in the magnetic flux enclosed by Earth's magnetic field. The reverse process occurs further downstream 'behind' the Earth, where magnetic flux is added back into the magnetosphere by reconnection again. Its a cycle, so overall the field is preserved over a long time, but there are short term gains and losses.\n\nThis same process happens on Mercury too, but since the solar winds are stronger there and the planet's field is weaker, its possible sometimes for the field to be eroded so much that the solar wind directly impacts the planet's surface.

The plasma that carries the magnetic field will not just teleport through an obstacle like a planet, even if it doesn't have an intrinsic magnetic field. And since the magnetic field is carried by the plasma, that too will have to stagnate, stop and bend. Every single object in interplanetary space have a bowshock.\n\n\nBut yeah, I rarely see pretty stuff like this coupling all events leading up to a visually spectacular aurora. Many thanks!",

I think it's also important to mention that the research we perform on magnetic reconnection, which powers these aurora, hold the key to making fusion viable.\n\n\n\n[Thrusters powered by magnetic reconnection also have a lot of promise](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-plasma-physics/article/an-alfvenic-reconnecting-plasmoid-thruster/F296E45CC504E8FF2586EA79117E2514), and might just take humanity to the outer planets and beyond. \n\n\nAnd finally, since I don't think most people will read this far: I think magnetorotational instability is a much better explanation than dark matter for the rotational speed we detect around galaxies, so I suspect the search for dark matter won't actually yield any significant findings. But we are pretty far away from being able to prove this.",

You are thinking of them kind of like human teeth where you lose one (of the adult teeth) and it is gone, think of it more like shark teeth that are replenished (infinitely? Not 100% sure how many teeth shark have).\n\nBut if you want to know what happens when a planet has no, or a smaller magnetic field, look at Mars. One of the main reasons it would be extremely hard to terraform mars is because it doesn\u2019t have a molten core (or it is not as molten as the earths) and so it doesn\u2019t has nearly as strong of a magnetic field. Thus it can\u2019t buffet the suns plasma and so it\u2019s atmosphere gets striped away leaving it pretty barren.",

The sun's magnetic fields (dragged by the Solar wind) can connect with the earth's magnetic field lines facing towards the sun, and as the plasma continues to move past the earth, it drags these newly connected fields with it to the opposite side of the earth. Look up magnetic reconnection for more info on how magnetic fields can split and connect to others.\n\nPS: if plasma didn't bend magnetic fields the earth's magnetosphere would be perfectly spherical. But due to the Solar wind, its shaped more like a top with the pointy end being dragged away from the sun.",

If it were propane, the max fill level is 80% to allow for expansion.  If it was a delivery truck, it would start out full and get emptier as the deliveries were completed.  Half full, which the animation shows, is when this phenomenon is the worst.\n\nYou can actually feel it sloshing side to side when you're sitting at a stop.  The truck will gently rock left and right.",

When I had a sports car, I would regularly stop by a bugmasher airport and fill up 93 for a decent bit cheaper than the stations. (And it was fresher, too.)",

So while it may have been more common decades ago, gas stations comfiting octane fraud is pretty rare in modern history.\n\nAlso fresher gas?  A ridiculously slow gas station in the middle of nowhere gets at least a truck a week so there gas isn't more then a week or 2 old.  An average gas station is somewhere between daily and every other day deliveries.  And those big 16+ pump stations turn their entire inventory a few times a day.",

My experience is anecdotal as far as gas stations passing off one grade for another, I shouldn't have made it sound like it's common.\n\nIn my area though I personally knew a few guys who owned stations/tow truck combos and they'd talk about doing it. Again tho, not common.\n\nHonestly i just did the 'regurgitate a fact without verifying it.' My teachers would all say the airport had fresher/cheaper gas. (It was 100% slightly cheaper though. Made a difference with a big tank) So I just took their words for it.\n\nThanks for correcting me; sometimes I can fall victim to feeling too confident about my knowledge instead of verifying it.",

It's mostly a sign that you have engine issues (because the gas is detonating earlier than it's supposed to and you need the higher octane to resist it).  That said, some FCA cars (typically 5.7L HEMI) do recommend it.\n\n91/93 are usually for higher strung engine compression or tunes where the timing is advanced in the tuning for extra performance.  Typically sports or luxury cars.\n\nFor the most part, go with what the owners manual says and you'll be fine.",

Most of the time you get between 40 and 50k lbs in a trailer depending on the density of what you're hauling, which keeps your truck around 80k overall. \n\nThe way I've seen it is, unless you have your own trailers or are a big enough customer for a carrier that they dedicate some to you, trailers are essentially either food grade or non-food grade. \n\nThey're washed in between customers, you reserve one, they show up to your location, you inspect it and review the list of prior contents for some number of loads, then decide to accept or reject the trailer. If you reject it it can either be washed again or replaced depending on why you're rejecting. \n\nI remember us occasionally using food grade trailers for non-food grade applications. I believe there are more strict washing requirements for it to go back after, and the products it can be used for after going back will be limited for awhile too. Normally we saw that with things like glycerin that would come out of the same plant but would sometimes go to a food grade customer and other times to an industrial customer. In a pinch we'd use a food grade trailer for an industrial customer delivery.",

It would be impossible to get everything. Fuel and other liquids will have baffles in the tanks to stop the sloshing. They taught me in CDL school it\u2019s harder to stop, harder to go, and impossible to control the side sloshing when going around turns, the liquid will throw you around the road. You have to take corners at the yellow recommended speed limit or slower or else you will tip. If you look at a tanker truck and see that it has rivets or bolts on the outside, it has baffles. If it is completely smooth, it doesn\u2019t have baffles.",

Regular, curtain side, chameleon curtains aka rolling tarps, low boys, step decks, flat racks, and many others. Each one does the same thing but you use them to haul specific types of objects. For example, open air flat decks will mostly haul fertilizer, wood and wood products (like roof truss systems and melamine), metal, rocks, and other stuff. I haul specialty cut lumber and wood products in a new 32\u2019 curtain side trailer. Some of the newer trailers have moving winch points, makes everything super convenient when strapping down your load because you can adjust where your tie down locations are based on your load. Legally you are required to have a strap every 8 feet. The straps I use are rated for 5400 lbs. If you are hauling equipment, you will use chains instead of fabric straps, you will see this mainly on lowboys and step deck trailers. Also, some trailers such as the chameleon curtains are super nice and you don\u2019t have to tarp (which is a bitch because the tarps are super heavy) so you can just pull the curtain back.",

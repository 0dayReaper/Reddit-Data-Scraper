However they are almost always sold and rated for x number of cycles, so assuming you are looking to make a profit it's fairly easy math.\n\nFun mold fact, my dad made the mold for one of the runs of barbies in the late 80s, but the drawings they gave him had an error, so the boobs were hilariously, and pornographically huge. They realized it only after they did a test run. After informing mattel (mattel ate the replacement cost since they didn't pay extra for drawing review), They were supposed to destroy the test run, but he's got one or two in a box somewhere.",

It was definitely efficient, but it also meant that when a machine messed up it REALLY messed up because without a human constantly watching it, it would get blocked then just throw all the additional product trying to enter it across the floor until someone turned it off. For mass produced plastic bottles that's not too bad but id imagine that thing throwing metal scraps everywhere or accidentally mangling itself would be a lot more costly. last thing you'd want is for it to rip the cookie cutter in half, incorrectly dispense it, then slam more metal on the uneven surface and fuck itself before a human can shut it off.",

But at some point it's cheaper just to have a guy grab it. Only problem with that is you have to pay them forever, instead of once for a machine. But companies are lazy and only care about next quarters profits. And paying a guy $8000 per quarter looks better than spending $25k one quarter. I hate modern businessery.",

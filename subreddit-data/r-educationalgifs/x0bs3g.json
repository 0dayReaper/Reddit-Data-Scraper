Moths usually have stouter, hairier bodies (relative to their overall size). Butterflies are mostly daytime fliers; there are moths that fly at daytime too, but many, many species fly at night (and are attracted to light). If it\u2019s dull gray or brown it\u2019s likely a moth; if it\u2019s brightly colored it can be either. \n\nThere are exceptions to all of the above, but looking at the antennae and the body will get you right 99% of the time with the most common species.",

That is to say, moths evolved first, and then a lineage of day flying moths became the butterflies. Some lineages of moths are closely related to butterflies, while others are much more distant. Funnily though, some of the closest relatives of butterflies, like the Hedylidids, are really boring, bland moths, while some of their more distant relatives, like the Uraniids, are the ones which are butterfly-like. Convergent evolution at work!",

Their wings have little ligaments that bring the wings to the \"up\" position. They have one big muscle attached to both of their front wings that yanks them down to flap. The front wings drag the back wings down (which is how that cool wave effect happens). Most other insects have multiple muscles per wing and are thus more dexterous.\n\nBonus fun fact: when pinning moths/butterflies, the muscle sticks to the pin before it dries completely and you can temporarily simulate their flapping motion by moving the pin.",

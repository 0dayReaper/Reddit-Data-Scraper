The Mongols rode horseback and liked to move quickly but to cross the Indus they would have to be stationary for a long period of time which they didn't like. There was also some resistance from the local kingdoms but the main factor was the massive Indus river.",

Shah Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu and Genghis did fight at the western banks of the Indus. After being defeated Jalal crossed the river and seeked refuge in India (Delhi sultanate). \nThis is where the Mongols chose not to cross the river. The most accepted theory is that the Mongols still had a massive army even after the fight to enter India and invade it. But the Indus river proved a tricky problem. It's easier to cross a river with 10 horses but crossing a whole army would have taken time not to mention loss of troops. That time would have allowed the Delhi sultanate to get a much better strategic position to defend. Keep in mind that India* was the wealthiest region of the time and the Mongols knew that the Delhi sultanate would probably win if they had the better position.\nTLDR: crossing the river = a bad war position against the Indian kingdoms.\n\nThere are also many other theories as to why Genghis didn't invade India.\n1. India was the birthplace of Buddhism, the religion Mongols followed and hence the reluctance to spill blood on Indian land.\n2. He may have postponed the attack rather than cancel it. Some historians say that he went back to China to take care of some rebels and come back with a better plan and army to invade India.\n3. After his death there was word that on the banks of Indus Genghis saw a dream in which a unicorn told him not to invade India, being a big believer in shamanism tradition he retreated.",

Mongols tried to enter into the subcontinent many times ( first at the request of the then northern ruler's brother and after that for expansion of Empire )  but failed, through they did capture Kashmir and many territories of North West India. Battle of Jaran manjur, siege of sehwan, battle of kili and siege of Delhi are some good examples. \nThere were also many counter raids in Mongol controlled Afghanistan by Delhi rulers and his allies but they never attempted to capture Mongol territories as the northern powers were preoccupied with threats from south and east Indian kingdoms. \n\nWhen the strong north Indian powers eventually declined Delhi was raided and occupied by the then Mongol ruler Timur, somewhere around the end of 14th century. One of Timur's descendants, Babur, after the fall of chagtai khanate, would go on to invade and establish the Mughal empire in India, though his ancestors were Mongols, Babur hated Mongols ( probably because of islamic teachings and indoctrination  )",

This is the reason why we lack lots of history about what happened in Pre Mauryan times. Our main sources for pre-Mauryan times come from religious texts and records. It doesn't help lots of records were also destroyed in series of invasions.\n\n\nChanakya was the first to state that proper record keeping of the state should be done, but serious efforts would be done by Chandragupta's grandson, Asoka. This is why Mauryan history is detailed.\n\n\n&gt;His general however, Seleceus, is mentioned in Indian records.\n\nAnd this is why he's mentioned. The Mauryans kept extensive records of matters related to them.\n\n\nAlexander was already overstretched by the time he reached India. Unlike Persia, he had no information about any enemies he may face in India. He knew about elephants due to Persia using the Indian variety, but besides that there wasn't much he knew. He most likely would have invaded India again, this time with a much more prepared force. The Persian campaign took decades to prepare, and had been prepared since his father's time after all",

Alexander died soon after, then you had Seleceus who tried but failed, eventually deciding on a peace treaty that gave him 500 war elephants in return for most of the Indian satrap lands.\n\n\nThe Seleucids after Seleuceus, would lose their land connection to India with the rise of the Parthians, who would bit by bit eat up the Seleucids, invading from Central Asian plains.\n\n\nSo the Greeks never really had a chance to invade India anyway, due to the Parthians. The Indo-Greeks who you mentioned, did invade India a few times. One of their King, Menander reached quite far too.\n\n\n\n&gt;So did the Romans.\n\n\nHow could the Romans even invade India? They were separated by the entirety of Persia, first by the Parthians and later the Sassanids. It was too far for them anyway\n\n\nYou need to check a map of all these Empires my friend.\n\n\n&gt;The one about Porus's defeat, were you referring Megasthenes' accounts?\n\n\nMegasthenes didn't really write about Alexander's conquests. His main work Indica comes during his time as a Seleucid ambassador to Chandragupta Maurya. He didn't write about Alexander.",

Much of their forces fell ill once they had occupied parts of the region which depleted morale and ability to resist the Vietnamese. Not to say the the Vietnamese didn't defeat them fair and square. They employed excellent tactics, such as a scorched earth policy, cutting off food supplies, superior naval tactics at Bach Dan river and guerilla warfare. But, climate did play a major role, especially in the first two invasions.\n\nIn 1257, 1284, and 1287, the Mongol armies of Kublai Khan invaded Vietnam, sacking the capital at Thang Long (renamed Hanoi in 1831) on each occasion, only to find that the Vietnamese had anticipated their attacks and evacuated the city beforehand. Disease, shortage of supplies, the climate, and the Vietnamese strategy of harassment and scorched earth tactics foiled the first two invasions. [Source: Library of Congress ]",

As pointed out by Jackmeister from r/Askhistorians who wrote an episode for K&amp;G https://youtu.be/qrPnMEpOuNw and this [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-017-0012-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-017-0012-3)the whole pop culture myth is bologne.  \r  \n\r  \nThe og team found Mongolian populations had a particular gene in abundance and through somewhat shoddy unreliable methods concluded it arose in the 1000s ad thus to explain this rapid growth the claimed must be from the upper classes of Mongolian society. As the were previous examples of such happening in other societies as the upper classes don't suffer from stuff like malnutrition and in polygamous societes especially.\r  \n\r  \nHowever as they had only random genetic samples from various populations with no way to distinguise between noble dscendents with geneologies and random serfs and bannermen. They made the really odd claim that the Hazara had an oral tradition of being the direct descendents of Chinggis Haan which proved it was common among the mongol nobility. Howver no else says the Hazara are such.\r  \n\r  \nIt should be noted they claimed he was only himself a descendent and the gene spreading more from higher per capita babies than any individual. However their dating is questionable as exheumed graves ffrom as far back as the 500s BCE have the gene, the descendents of Chinggisid royalty and nobility with geneologies to prove it lack the gene entirely, and the gene is only found commonly in populations whose ancestors were poor commoners.\r  \n\r  \nThus it is the other way around the gene is an ancient mutation that spread slowly but steadily in the lower class populations of proto-Mongolic, mongolic peoples and those who mixed with them such as Turks, Central asian,  etc populations. With much earlier steppe empires such as the Xioungnu, Gokturks, Avars etc spreading it long before Temujin was even born.",

Other option for large empire to fall is too much centralization.\n\nAlso conquering such land in middle ages was easy for Mongols. Eurasian Steppe was like a flat motorway for horses and full of strategy resource (i.e. horses) - ridiculously easy to sustain big/mobile army. They also mostly conquered low population/development areas and higher development areas with internal problems (or both - Russia was both lowly developed and had internal problems).",

Just gold. Pay in time and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nAfter Genghis Khan died, Russia finally decided to throw away any Mongolian presence, which they successfully did, pretty much putting the last nail into Genghis Khan\u2019s legacy coffin; but before that they paid. The most interesting thing here for me is the fact that there are Russian accounting books from those times that stated that paying Mongolians is.. cheaper and safer than gathering an army with a chance of loosing the battle. \n\nGenghis Khan knew that. It was intentional, knowing that Eastern culture was alien to Slavs, zero attempts to somehow include those lands into Empire properly were made. Local rulers were allowed to rule, as long as they are loyal and pay in time. \n\nIt\u2019s a genius way of making people pay. Don\u2019t touch them and don\u2019t intervene so they\u2019ll think that it\u2019s not so bad and maybe not worth risking.",

If you want to read more there's The Mongol World by several scholars or the Mongol EMpire section in Limits of universal rule. \n\nBut anyways even during Chinggis Ha'an's time the conquered sedentary people could be directly administered lines similar to the Mongol feudal decimal system except under a military governor or nearby commander who would conduct censuses and would then collect taxes, supplies and levy men from households for corvee labour or warfare.\n\nThough households would grouped into units of 3,4,5 etc with only one household providing an adult man with the rest paying a special tax for his equipment, provisions and training which to my knowledge continued into the Ming dynasty as it was a cheap conveniant way of raising troops.\n\nEven if a city surrendered without a fight and kept its previous rulers they would still have a darugchi (overseer, manager) or appointed. And the more a city resisted the less autonomy it had and the more reprisals there were after it got conquered. With mass conscription of men and the supllying of provisions being a common demand near the frontlines.\n\nFrom Ogedei onward you see more non-Mongol administartion with local flavours with the emergence of the Grand Secretariat, which was split into regional secretaitats which would be split into smaller ones up to city governors. The regional secretariats were based china, CA and Iran and a uncompleted European regional secretariat to bring down the autonomy of the jochids and their rus vassals was well under way under Ha'an Monkhe until he died unexpectedly resulting in interregnum. \n\nOther methods of centralisation was for example the abalishment of local traditional taxes in say I think the jizya or whatever it's called in iran in favour of stadnardised ones such as a wealth tax on livestock, a poll tax on adult men etc. These actually had income brackets in a progressive tax system. in Chirstopher atwood's thousands, otogs, and banners ... he describes the decimal system in place in Tibet except there were also tax brackets based on for example how many geese, or sheep you had, whether your home needed more than 2 large or 4 small pillars to hold it up etc. \n\nMost of the machination of the empire outside of the Big elections for the next Ha'an were carried out in intrigue withing the administration be it the seizing of appanages from nobles and chinggisid princes, the lands governed by a particular tamuchi commander or 2 iranian daruqchi who argue who should collect the taxes and control over a region. With even minor cities getting swept up in the factions at Qaraqorum. With traveling to the courst of Mongol rulers to curry favour being common place.\n\nSimple demands of payment in return for not attacking  happened in the periphery but not the actual center. There's a reason they able to conquer so much land and raise such massive armies only a tiny minority of which being Mongol. \n\nAlso you seem to be one of those people who believe that the Mongol empire collapsed immediatly after Chinggis Ha'an's death otherwise I can't imagine why you'd make it seem like the rus gaining independence was an immediate thing or the only \"legacy\" when he was dead for long time by the time of the conquest of the Rus. It's just bizarre. [https://youtu.be/cnGW3p4lFPU](https://youtu.be/cnGW3p4lFPU)",

Fur trading became one of their main exports (along with more slavs of course).\n\nI recall that at some point, the Rus' ruling dinasty in Kiev was the most well connected family in all of Europe with the king there marrying all his daughters to kings of modern day France, Germany, and so forth...",

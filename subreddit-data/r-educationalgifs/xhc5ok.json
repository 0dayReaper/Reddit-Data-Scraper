If you look at the cutting portion they\u2019re leaving the holdfasts on the rope so the seaweed will grow back.\n\nETA: seaweed reproduced via spores so the spores will float around the ocean and attach to a surface, in this case the rope.",

We would maneuver our boat to a section and lower a large conveyer belt into the water. Turn on the belt and the seaweed would be pulled out from the water onto the belt, where a mechanical arm acting like a pair of teeth would chop the seaweed into smaller bits. Then the smaller bits would fall into large nets of about 2,000lbs. We\u2019d get about 20 bags and head back to port where a crane would lift the bags into semi trucks and taken to be processed.",

Seaweed grows about 2ft per day, which is about 30x faster than land plants. \n\nPlus kelp traps CO2, which de-acidifies the water and creates a ideal habitat for other plants and animals. \n\nKelp can also be burned and used as an alternate source of energy, reducing the need for fossil fuels. \n\nKelp farms are an incredibly efficient and effective way to fight climate change.",

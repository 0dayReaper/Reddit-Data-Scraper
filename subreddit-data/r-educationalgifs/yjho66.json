If it's large enough that the gravity at one end of your body is the same as the gravity at the other end at the event horizon, you wouldn't notice anything as you enter. Once you cross the event horizon, though, all futures lead eventually to the singularity - there is no path that will ever take you outside the event horizon again. If you could live long enough (lifespan + supplies), eventually you'd get into a region where the gravity gradient would tear you apart as you get closer and closer to the center.\n\nEdit: this video explains it quite nicely.\n\n https://youtu.be/QqsLTNkzvaY",

How could greenhouse gases *not* be causing the planet to warm, given that we're raising the heat capacity of an atmosphere being continually bombarded by energy from the sun? It's simple physics. We've known how this works for literally a century. The uncertain part isn't whether emissions are causing warming, its what effect that will have on the weather and ecosystems of this planet.",

We have a pretty good idea that immediate response is needed to avert catastrophic change, which is the crux of this discussion. \n\nNo one is getting crucified for figuring out the most effective ways of targeting climate change. However, you're talking about anthropogenic climate change insofar as \"activities;\" that's the only way to segue from \"blaming one thing.\"\n\nWe know, with consensus, that it is caused by humans and through what mechanisms. There's uncertainty with regards to feedback loops and the like (e.g. open ocean having a lower albedo than ice) but it isn't like it is a mystery what is causing this.",

I think the problem a lot of people have with your approach (or the one you are speaking on behalf of) is that this is a time sensitive issue. Unfortunately, if i am correct, a lot of top climate scientists have expressed that we are beyond the point in the timeline where our efforts will reverse what is coming. With that knowledge, a lot of people want action now. I know you're not advocating against action in any way, but when people call for more studies and more targeted studies - they are also usually calling for us to wait until those are completed before taking action.\n\nI hope you understand what position i am advocating and please feel free to rebuttal or follow up with more information on your opinion.",

This resulted in major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere.Evidence suggests that the anomaly was predominantly a volcanic winter event caused by the massive 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in April in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). This eruption was the largest eruption in at least 1,300 years (after the extreme weather events of 535\u2013536), and perhaps exacerbated by the 1814 eruption of Mayon in the Philippines.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

At least as far back as 400 centuries ago with fire, and 100 centuries ago with the whole agriculture thing.",

Put one that expands a lot in a tube, mark where it\u2019s at in ice water, and then mark where it\u2019s at in boiling water and divide the length between the two by 180 and you have the length of expansion per degree.  Divide the per degree length by ten and you have a scale down to a tenth of a degree and so on and so forth.\n\nThe precision is determined by how accurately you place the scale on the tube which was pretty easy to do back then.",

They describe the visualization as such:\n\n&gt; This animation shows the evolving distribution of 12-month average temperature anomalies across the surface the Earth from 1850 to present. Anomalies are measured with respect to 1951 to 1980 averages. The red vertical line shows the global mean, and matches the red trace in the upper-left corner. The data is from Berkeley Earth and the animation was prepared with Matlab.\n\nAs for why the 1951 to 1980 averages were chosen as a baseline:\n\n&gt; A baseline of 1951 to 1980 is one of the common choices in climatology. By WMO convention, climatologies are always based on at least 30-year averages. Any choice of a reference period is going to be somewhat arbitrary, and will often reflect the goals of how it is to be used. Often, when talking about climate change, you want a baseline that is far enough in the past that you can meaningfully show changes, but not so long ago that you will start having large uncertainties about what the baseline average actually was.\n\n&gt; When discussing local changes, the 1950s is the earliest decade that allows you to be more-or-less globally complete. The 1950s was the period when humanity first created permanent bases in Antarctica. Any earlier than the 1950s and you are going to have trouble defining what the reference temperature for Antarctica actually was, which makes it impractical for a local baseline.\n\n&gt; It probably isn't obvious from the animation, but prior to the 1950s the global reconstructions have gaps in Antartica (and other places as one goes even earlier). As a result the distribution shown in the animation actually sums to somewhat less than 100% of Earth's surface prior to the 1950s.",

The ozone layer has since stabilized and recovered as a result of our global action.  Then their generation took control over the reigns of power.  \n\nIt seems more arrogant to assume your actions have no environmental consequences than to assume that 7-8 billion people collectively releasing dozens of gigatons of ghgs per year into the atmosphere, in addition to all of the other waste and agricultural chemicals we manufacture, has no effect whatsoever on our ecosystem. \n\nIf their generation was in control during the 80s, I doubt the Montreal Protocol would have been adopted. CFCs would still be legal and our ozone layer would be completely fucked.",

Ice sheet evolution is very sensitive to temperature, and the initiation of NH glaciation at around 3 million years ago would not have been possible in the model if global temperature would have been higher than 2\u00b0C relative to preindustrial during the early Quaternary. Since the model has been shown to accurately reproduce the sea level variations over the last 400,000 years and also the spatial ice sheet distribution at the last glacial maximum (Ganopolski &amp; Brovkin 2017), we are confident that the sensitivity of ice sheets to climate is well represented in the model.\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08307-w",

Also be important to note that the axial tilt and milankovitch cycle impact global temperatures a lot too. Right now we're supposed to be in a cooler period, which is why the be current trend of more extremes and warming in certain areas is so concerning. If Nebraska is 5 degrees warmer on average now, what will it be like in the warming period? Also, not all predictive models take the milankovitch cycle and axial tilt into account, so things are probably gonna be worse than we are anticipating.",

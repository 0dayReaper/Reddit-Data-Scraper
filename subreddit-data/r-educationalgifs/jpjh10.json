It is a directional valve that prevents food from entering the airway. It is also part of the vocal suite; the set of unique physiological features that allow for the extreme variety of arbitrary articulations that form speech.\n\nMany tropical birds have demonstrated an astonishing talent for mimicry, but we have not yet been able to isolate arbitrary intraspecial linguistic markers. On the other end of the spectrum, marine mammals have be documented addressing one another with individual call in and sign off markers specific to the individual, but lacking the ability to mimic sounds outside of their range.\n\nAll of this is to say, animals very clearly speak among themselves, and many of them are eager to speak to us. I may sound like a kook by saying this, but I think studying interspecial communication is just as important as space exploration. \n\nHow can we expect to speak with aliens if we can't even speak our terrestrial brethren?",

So I just wanted to say this isn't necessarily an expected frequency for healthy adults to be aspirating. If anyone is experiencing this frequently and also has recurring to chest infections or pneumonia, I'd recommend you see a speech pathologist for an assessment of your swallowing.",

It's when it becomes a consistent thing that you should perhaps get it checked out.",

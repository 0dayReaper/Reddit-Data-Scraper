You don't use less paper, you use the same paper differently.\n\nTo make this easy: whatever wrapping you use, it always has to cover the box. So, at least, it will need the same area as the surfaces of the box you want to wrap.\n\nHowever, it is what happens with the overlapping paper that is important. For some gifts, a certain area of wrapping may be very inefficient. I can't do a rule of thumb from the top of my head, but I would guess the following: boxes with three significant dimensions, this doesn't work. Boxes that are long and wide, but thin, yeah give it a try.",

Or you can reverse X and Y in order to use a more oblong piece and fold it differently.\n\nThe area of the diagonal wrapping paper is 0.5 X^2 + 0.5 Y^2 + 2Z^2 + XY + 2XZ + 2YZ and the area of the rectangle method is 2XY + 2XZ + 2YZ + 2Z^2 (regardless of whether you use the slightly oblong method or the more oblong method, same math).\n\nSubtracting these, we see that the paper saved by using the diagonal method is equal to XY - 0.5X^2 - 0.5Y^2. For positive real X and Y, this quantity can never be positive, which means that the diagonal method (the OP) never actually requires less wrapping paper than a traditional rectangular method. When X=Y (a square object), the two methods use the same amount of paper.",

This is true because there's a 45/45/90 triangle formed by half of the blue triangle. Then the diagonal goes downward to get to the bottom of the present (we're up to length 0.5 Y+ Z), then it goes all the way across the bottom of the present, adding a length of X (length 0.5 Y + Z + X), then comes back upwards by Z again to the top (length 0.5 Y + 2Z + X) then finishes with the dotted green line which also has length Y/2, for a total of Y + 2Z + X.\n\nThe other diagonal, the vertical one, is the same, but you're adding X/2 twice (the red and purple dotted lines) and adding Y once (across the bottom vertically) instead of the other way around.",

Two of the corners will overlap, and two won't. That overlap will create a square of diagonal length `d-2y-2z` and the gap between the two sides that don't meet will be `2x+2z-d`. If you're visualizing them correctly, those two lengths must be the same, so set them equal and solve for `d=x+y+2z`.",

I recommend adding a centimeter or so to your measurements because sometimes its just hard to get a perfect wrap.\n\nAnother thing to note is that even though you are saving some inches of paper, remember that you're still probably gonna leave an extra couple inches on the roll after you cut it which is probably going to be useless to you. So are you really saving that much paper?",

Let\u2019s say we have a box with width, length and height equal to w, l, h. Then, we can easily calculate the length of the first diagonal(the one wrapped first in that video). Based on it, it would be equal to 2h+3w(because it has 2 layers of wrapping at the top). Then, the length of the 2nd diagonal is 2h+2l. Here we have the problem:in rectangle, diagonals must be equal, so we need to use bigger diagonal in further calculations. So, if we have diagonal, to find length we need to find square root of diagonal/2. Since both sides are equal, it would give you the required size of paper",

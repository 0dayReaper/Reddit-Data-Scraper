Recreational surely takes one lane, but then the other 2 lanes must be dedicated to shipping vessels going in a given direction each (pacific to atlantic for 1 lane, and atlantic to pacific for the other lane).\n\nEdit --&gt; 3 sets of parallel locks not canals",

So a eastbound vessel is in a lock as it fills and it exits, a westbound vessel goes in as it empties.  \n\nAnd I swear I saw a video where small boats were in a lock with big cargo boats, so I don't think it's as cut and dry as 2 for cargo, 1 for recreational?\n\nBut honestly I'm not sure.",

The main issue in Panama is that the cut is in a fairly mountainous region, and it would have been far more  difficult to dig all the way down to sea level than it was in the flat terrain of Suez.",

The Med now has a large amount of invasive species from the Red Sea. Locks with fresh water (like the Panama canal), and then requiring ships to purge bilge tanks, helps prevent invasive species transfers. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lessepsian_migration",

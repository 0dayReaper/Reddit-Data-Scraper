It wasn't just because of the evolution of lignin eating fungus, but geological conditions for peat formation and burial, meaning coal could in theory be \"regenerated\".",

It was during this bygone age, when the Appalachians towered much higher and more menacing than the gentle slopes and ridges we know today, that they were conscripted after a great battle to serve as the final prison for those dark forces. But of course, time marches inexorably on. Eons passed and the walls of the prison begin to wear thin. And Things that slumbered soundlessly below for millennia began to stir and become restless.\n\n&gt;They began to call to those who would hear them.\n\n&gt;To dig. To seek and find.

Crustal rock floats atop the upper mantle, which is more dense, so the crust cannot sink into the mantle due to its buoyancy. \n\nduring tectonic uplift the crust thickens beneath the mountain range about as much as it does above the surface; underneath the Himalayas the crust is about 70km thick, about twice the average thickness. So for every kilometre of crustal thickening that occurs, the top of the mountain range will rise by half a kilometre and the bottom of the crust will lower by half a kilometre. Imagine an iceberg floating in the ocean; add more ice on top and the iceberg will sit lower in the water, but the same proportion of the total mass of ice will sit above the surface due to buoyancy.\n\nAs far as limiting the upward growth of mountains, erosion from weathering is by far the most significant factor. Weathering increases with altitude, so higher slopes erode faster.",

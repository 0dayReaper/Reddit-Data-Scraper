He\u2019s soloed the North (Canada), the Everglades, north South Africa, jungles, etc. He\u2019s done a lot and has loads of knowledge. We go fishing and I have a few knots I tie depending on my line/lure and what I\u2019m feeling like tying at the moment. So out of curiosity I ask him how he ties his line, totally expecting some special way he came up with 15 years ago while in the Sumatran Jungle.... nope, \u201cI just tie a lot of knots. It works.\u201d \n  \nEdit: to clarify, cause everyone thinks \u201cAmerican\u201d on Reddit and I wasn\u2019t clear, we are Canadian, by soloed the North, I mean Northern Canada.",

You can adjust the number of wraps to be appropriate for the size line you're using.\n\nI've also found the improved clinch knot doesn't seat as well as the standard clinch knot.... Leading to more likely breakoffs or slipping knots.",

I am curious though at strength of the knot when tied directly to the hook or if that makes any difference as both of their test involve attaching a leader rather than directly to the hook. \n\nAlso slightly concerned by their videos of the clinch knot / improved clinch knot as they perform a couple of things I have always been taught to avoid when tying. First being pulling on the tag end when tying the knot and second being too many loops. In their video of the clinch knot they double the amount of loops from 5-6 to 10. I don't know how much if any the loops affect the integrity but I do know when tightening a clinch pulling on the tag disrupts the integrity of the knot doing so causes the loops to not thread down the line properly. Normally I wouldn't go through the effort of looking this kinda stuff up but I saw in their description they put\n\n&gt; while also having a tag end that sticks straight up \n\ngranted in their videos they show cutting the tag to the knot which is counter intuitive to what they described. \n\nEven further I'm now more confused after doing a bit more research as their video of the clinch knot video is whats described usually as the improved clinch knot and I'm not sure what their actual improved clinch knot video is of, as I've never seen anyone double loop around the eye with a clinch knot before.",

Wet flys fly better choked with the loop knot for Atlantic salmon, while dry flies hacked on normally. \n\nThe west coast is a big ol' mix bag that I'm still learning (weighted tips bogged my mind for a solid 2 years) but I'll keep in mind the loop knot.",

Sorta like a 2D Eve (except really not) finally in early access and the response has been really encouraging so far.\n\nWe're making this game as an attempt to create a new genre where the game world ends up facilitating a simulation of human society. Player's characters live in the game world and need to try to survive with the same limitations that people have in real life. Where technology can be invented by players to make their in-game life easier. Everything is player driven, we just provide the virtual environment.\n\nThis is our first attempt at creating a game like this.\n\nHere you can get access to the game, watch concept/gameplay videos, and read about this player-driven survival space MMORPG\n\nIt's currently available to play on PC, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and directly in the browser. Use the website to find a link to each platform when you go to Play Now.\n\nWe also have a subreddit r/voidspace. There you can find a link to discord where you can connect with the devs and the rest of the community.\n\n Update: You can currently try the game for a few hours for free! Just be aware that this is a new feature and if we get overrun then we'll have to disable it temporarily.",

That states this is the best overall line to line knot for strength/ease of knot. Especially easy if you are mono-mono and braid-mono.\n\nIf the lines are very different sizes then I use a double uni knot. Also pretty easy with no crazy loops and turns. When I fly fish, I tie on all my flies with a uni knot.",

You can get away with a double uni but once you master the FG its in my opinion the best knot, atleast for casting. \n\nConnecting (double uni) braid to a swivel and the leader in the other end of it is great if you want something easier to tie in a boat or bad weather.\n\nThese are the ones that i use almost all of the time, the FG can be a hard one to get right however. Though you should always try and learn as many knots as possible, there are tons of variations that do the trick!\n\nEdit: I should add that the palomar knot shown in the gif is great for braid, really hard to mess up and it holds up well, its not something that you want to use with heavier mono though.",

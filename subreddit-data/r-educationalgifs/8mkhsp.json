The farther you get from the center, the more error prone the shot gets and you start to depend more on your fundamentals being correct, so the follow, draw and sidespin shots take more practice to get to a level where the cue ball behaves kinda sorta a little bit how you planned it to.",

I have a decent stick with a good tip but my spins were acting odd. Sometimes hitting left side it would go left, mostly it would go right. What would explain this? I kind of assume it has to do with the contact side of the ball I was aiming for, but typically they were rather straight shots. I used to play a lot (bar pool and solo full size) in college and I remember left going left, right going right. Maybe I am remembering incorrectly but I feel like it came as second nature. ",

I typically am a backspin player and rarely use top so my strokes would always be low/right low/left. It was happening 99% of the time, enough that I started to hit left in order to end right. No flat spots, and I\u2019m a top of hand player so the lowest I can hit is flat hand height. \n\nThe only other thing I can recall is hit strength. If I smashed it it would go opposite, if I hit it light it would go same side. Maybe the ball popped up the the air and always landed sideways? Seems flimsy. I\u2019ll just have to find another table and mess around a bit. ",

You want your tip to be just pointing below parallel otherwise you cause the ball to rise onto the upper edge of the tip shoot off the felt and up as you're experiencing. Notice in the clip that the bottom of the cue doesn't touch the felt, but the bottom edge of tip almost is at the end of the motion despite the fact a dead straight cue would have a larger gap at the front compared to the back.\n\nNot following through enough. If you stop short, or jab and pull back, and don't cue through the ball the friction that starts driving the backspin on the ball never happens and instead you're just causing a point of impact below the centre of mass which then causing an upward angle. Enough force on one of these and you'll get a hop. Again, in the clip you'll see that the tip ends up way past the back edge of the cue ball.\n\nPlaying it too hard. As with any shot, the faster and harder you play it, the more the imperfection in your cueing action shows. Playing it smoother and slower until you're consistent, then gradually ramping it up to get that power bit by bit will get you there.\n\nNot cueing straight. Most people who don't really practice it end up twisting their cue, moving the back end closer to them as they strike, dropping the back end as they're pushing through the ball. You need to just practice pushing the cue straight and finding the most natural motion for you that does that. Starting slow and building up again, because as you start to add power the natural instinct is to throw technique out the window for leverage by using your wrist, shoulder and elbow to pivot instead of just your elbow.\n\nAll of the above. Most likely you're doing a little bit of each of these things right now, until you practice a shitton, you'll carry on making just enough of each that you don't play the ball you mean to.\n\nSource: I once got a break of 16 on 4 balls on purpose.",

Shots with the amount of spin seen in the gif take a great deal of practise and skill and steady hands to be accurate and consistent.  Trying those shots without easing into it is NOT advised unless you like the idea of paying for table repairs, or medical bills.  The more you attempt to add the higher the chance the que digs into the cloth or the ball goes across the room if done improperly. \n\nI played in, and won, plenty of amateur tournaments when I was younger.  I\u2019ve seen so many flying que balls from people attempting shots outside of their capabilities, even launched a few myself.  ",

You can visualize it as if they were two gears meshed together.  One turns clockwise, which makes the other turn counterclockwise.\n\nOne \"trick shot\" my dad taught me was when you are in the situation where you have the cue ball and two of your balls directly lined up with the pocket.  If you want to make both of them with your shot, you should use bottom spin.  That gives the ball you hit with the cue top spin, so after it knocks in the second ball, it hopefully follows it into the pocket as well.  ",

It can seem to have a large effect because of what happens to the cue ball upon contact.  Whenever you use any english, the cue ball will deflect away from the tip because of the physics of it being a spherical object and a force being applied away from the center of mass. \n\nThis effect isn't noticable whenever you're only using pure draw or pure follow (bottom/top spin) because it doesn't affect your aim.\n\nFor example, if you're using left english, you'll have to aim further left in order to strike the object ball at the same angle as with a center ball shot.  \n\nThe reason that left/right english isn't explained as much is because this adjustment for deflection is heavily based on feel and depends on the specific cue being used.  Also, since for the most part side english doesn't affect the trajectory of the object ball, it's not a useful skill until you start to understand positional play.  Most players who are good enough to need side english have already logged enough table time to intuitively understand most of its mechanics.",

Always keep your back  arm perpendicular with your elbow during the swing \\(try not to swing your hand away or towards your body\\) it should be perfectly straight from pool cue to elbow.\n\nFocus on letting the pool cue \"float\" and don't use a full grip until you take the shot and even then just let the pool cue meet the palm, don't squeeze too much.\n\nPractice the bridge he using as it will help ensure the shaft of the cue remains stationary.\n\nIn some of his strokes he jerks the pool cue, this is bad. Learn to follow through the ball, majority of the time he does this pretty well.\n\nWhen you go to approach a shot hold the pool cue at the hip and have it cross in front of you. stand with your feet within shoulder length and line up your shot by rotating your body until the pool cue is on the tangent line the cue ball will follow once you take the shot. Let the pool cue balance in your hand and let it rotate on its own. Once it is in line, bend straight over the table and bridge the pool cue. your elbow and body will be lined up along this tangent. Most of the time you can get away with playing center ball if you want to play shape on the ball following the one you're aiming at. There are cases where you will need the necessary English, but typically you do not have to go willy nilly on the cue ball.\n\nFind a table and practice following through with lower center to stun the cue ball. place an object ball near the center of the table and shoot from a corner pocket into a corner pocket. Do this a few thousand times, yes a few thousand times. you can do it in a day or a 3 day split. but you will notice a huge difference in your ability just by doing this.\n\nYou hustlin' me boi!?",

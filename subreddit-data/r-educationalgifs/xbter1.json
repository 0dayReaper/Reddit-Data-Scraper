Any material becomes a perfect mirror as the light approaches glancing angles (in the limit). It\u2019s easy to see on laminated book covers or granite countertops. You can\u2019t always see it (on denim, for example), because the material is too rough for us to see the perfect reflection. This is why you see the \u201cI polished my car to a mirror shine\u201d posts on Reddit that are *always* shot at glancing angles to the car (cheaters).",

If (-10,-1) exists and (10,1) exists, (x,0) has to exist somewhere. It might not be at x = 0, but it exists.\n\nI like to think of it as: If you look at light reflected as the angle changes, it has to go from 0 to 100% at some point, otherwise there is a discontinuity. Just before the light no longer hits the glass, 99.99% or so of the light must be reflected (Ignoring other physical effects.)",

                    "comment": "The wavelength changes, yes, but equating wavelength with color only applies when we\u2019re talking about light in free space. The energy doesn\u2019t change so the light would still only ever excite a green-sensitive photodetector. There\u2019s no way to observe the shortened wavelength as a color change, so I\u2019d argue the color does not change.\n\nThere\u2019s also an argument to be made that light as we normally think of it ceases to exist in dense media like glass. Rather, the incident light wave excites a polarization wave in the atomic structure of the glass which then generates a new light wave when the polarization wave reaches the other side. For more info on this, read up on the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem.",

Apply energy to a crystal and what the fuck holy shit we've generated massless particles that somehow have momentum, but wait not a particle it's a wave, but not that kind of wave, more swapping energy between two phases, and which one was it? Oh right, now you've gone and fucked it all up.",

The light does not change color, it is always green.\n\nFrequency is what is related to the energy of the photon, by Planck\u2019s constant.  The energy of a photon cannot change simply by passing into a new medium, even though the wavelenth does change due to index of refraction.  For the energy to change, you\u2019d need to have it be absorbed and a fluorescence or phosphorescence event taking place.  Simple transmission doesn\u2019t change energy, and therefore doesn\u2019t change color. \n\nYour take is entirely wrong on the physics.  You\u2019ve mistakenly taken the description as wavelength = color, understood that wavelength changes in a material, and misinterpreted that as a color change in the material.  But it isn\u2019t wavelength that determines color, it\u2019s energy (and frequency, as a related value).  And the energy is constant going in and out of the glass block.",

It always moves at exactly the same speed. \n\nBut when a photon crashes into an atom, it is absorbed and its energy excites the atom's electrons into a higher orbit temporarily. When they drop back down to the stable orbit they were in before, that energy is released again as a photon, which resumes travel through space at the same speed.\n\nIn denser media this happens more often, so light is said to go \"slower\" through it. More atoms = more pit stops the photon has to make.\n\nRe: red/blue shift, those perceived color differences happen when the _source_ of the light moves away or toward an observer. Just like the perceived frequency of a siren goes up as it approaches you and down as it drives away, the perceived frequency of light goes up (i.e., towards blue) and down (towards red) under the same conditions. The difference is that with sound, it's perceptible at low speeds; with light, you wouldn't notice the change in color unless the source were moving at near the speed of light.",

I like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiHN0ZWE5bk) as a good explanation but I'll summarize the problems with it below.\n\nAbsorption-reemission like you're describing would cause a statistical delay, i.e. individual photons would take an *average* of some time to travel through the slab but some would be faster and some would be slower either because of random reemission times or as a function of the number of times they were absorbed. We can actually do that experiment with the right equipment, but a more \"basic\" one is something like looking at [newton's rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings) or other interferometers (LIGO, for instance, is a pair of big interferometers) which wouldn't work with something statistical like this.\n\nAbsorption and reemission also doesn't preserve direction but the laser seems to pass through just fine (this is also a problem with the other incorrect but often stated \"it has to bounce around a bunch more but still travels between bounces at *c*\" explanation).\n\n(Tagging /u/km4rbp as well.)",

Information is carried at the group velocity, so faster than light stuff isn't a problem. My intuition on that, though ***big caution that this is just offhand speculation***, is that a pure sine wave can't carry information, which would require modulation and therefore isn't a pure sine wave (i.e. there is no group, let alone group velocity, for a constant frequency).",

When it enters a medium with a different refractive index, the original wave still travels at the same speed but through a field which has its own wave function. The light we see is the sum of these two waves which appears to be slower, but the light itself is still going the same speed the whole time. That\u2019s why when the light exits out the other side of the medium it seems to go back to c immediately without accelerating or being acted on by a other force, it\u2019s because the other wave no longer is added to the lights wave. \n\nMan I hope that made sense",

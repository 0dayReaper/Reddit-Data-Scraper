And as small as these things are, prions are even smaller.\n\nHere's why:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3ATevenphage.svg\n\nIt stores the DNA in the upper part, the lower part acts basically as a claw to grab on the host. The long body acts like a syringe so latch on, then bear down and inject its DNA into the host. From what I was reading, the life cycle of these things is like 10 minutes.",

The reason it looks so complex at such a small size is due to the relatively low amount of genetic information passed along by the single stranded RNA. There is a debate among scientists as to is viruses are actually alive becuase they cannot survive outside a host and their only purpose is to infect and move on. Another crazy thing to look up is that humans carry a lot of viral DNA in our genetic code, reminants of the past 100k years of evolution and epigenetic events due to viral infection. Blows my mind. \n\nEdit: was corrected about part of my statement. See below. ",

Their only purpose is to infect a cell, inject its DNA or RNA into it and replicate. Because of their nature, some [retroviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus) can make for [decent delivery systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy#Vectors) for us to deliberately introduce DNA into a patient, in gene therapy treatments.\n\nThe viruses that infected us in the distant past were certainly passed from generation to generation, but not all DNA changes from viruses are necessarily passed on; with some types of viruses having a higher chance to pass it on to the next generation (like retroviruses, ie HIV). Seems like there's a lot more to viruses and how they get passed on from generation to generation; and I'm definitely out of my depth in that. [This article talks about Human Endogenous Viruses (HERV), which are viruses that are passed from generation to generation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1187282/)\n\nThe article below talks about the study that led to the discovery that HERVs make up nearly 8% of our DNA.\n\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-percent-virus-are-you/\n\n&gt;One type of virus, retroviruses, inserts a DNA copy of its RNA sequence into the host cell\u2019s genome upon infection. If the virus inserts into a reproductive cell and that cell goes on to produce an offspring, the viral DNA gets passed on from parent to child as part of the genome. At this point, the virus is locked in and is passed on from generation to generation. These are called endogenous retroviruses, or ERVs, and this can happen in any type of organism that viruses infect, including humans.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Although they were once thought to be simple traces of past viral infections, it turns out that these viral sequences can affect the host. At first, the sequences may still produce new viruses, which could infect other cells or other hosts. And when they insert into a genome, they can disrupt the function of that region of DNA. Our genome has a number of ways of combating and silencing these invaders, however. When that happens, these sequences aren\u2019t harmful anymore but are still scattered throughout the genome. Harmit Malik, evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer, said that \u201conce they\u2019ve been \u2018domesticated\u2019 then the genes or protein products that they encode might be of value to the host.\u201d\n\n&gt;This allows the host to use a genomic sequence that was evolved by the virus for other purposes. Although the viral DNA started as a parasitic element, in some cases it has been co-opted into functional roles by our genome...\n",

Bacteria are mostly seeing DNA, which explains why they use a CRISPR/DNA cleaving system to deal with viruses. Plants for instance use microRNA because everything they see is an RNA virus. We don't use either and instead use an interferon based system which is not necessarily better at dealing with any particular virus but gives us incredible versatility in dealing with viruses of any stripe.\n\nEdit: If anyone is interested, I recommend [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29266287) which I'll quote an excerpt of:\n\n&gt;&gt;Life is thought to have arisen from an RNA world prior to the invention of DNA. The biochemistry of RNA enabled this as it can both code for protein and perform enzymatic functions on its own. This duality of RNA remains evident in most essential cellular functions. In fact, ~5% of the complete protein repertoire of all life is dedicated to the metabolism of RNA.[1] Moreover, 50% of the domains responsible for associating and processing these RNAs are conserved across all life suggesting it predates our last universal common ancestor (LUCA). \n\n&gt;&gt;Given the capacity of the aforementioned domains to manipulate genetic material, it is perhaps not surprising that many of these same activities were repurposed for antiviral defense systems. This evolutionary retooling event is most evident when one observes signi\ufb01cant changes in the overall composition and replication strategy of the virosphere that impact a given population. For example, the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic biology coincided with dramatic changes in virus populations from being DNA- versus RNA-based, respectively.[2] The resulting expansion of RNA-based viruses early after eukaryogenesis would have necessitated the ability to rapidly adapt their defenses from being DNA- to RNA-centric [(Figure 1)](https://imgur.com/r73jBL7). In this environment, proteins capable of manipulating RNA would have been the \ufb01rst to be repurposed as novel defense systems, ultimately leading to the invention of an RNA targeting system such as RNA interference (RNAi). Similarly, as the plant and animal lineages split, there would have been a transition from a predominantly RNA virus population to one that showed little bias with regards to replication strategy. Here again we observe a second major shift in chordates away from RNAi to a general targeting protein-based defense called the interferon (IFN) system. With each major transition, the host could both retain and add to their repertoire of defenses [(Figure 1)](https://imgur.com/r73jBL7). In time, some of these defenses would be lost while others would adapt as selection pressure demanded.",

A viable provirus can't be formed if the genome can't physically fit into the capsule, so to counter this many viruses are comprised of repeating units so the amount of information required to construct a complete provirus is minimized.

Part of the reason spinal injuries are so difficult to treat is because you are snapping the axons of cells that can originate multiple feet away at the cell body. Those axons grew into their recipient tissues from the cell body during development in utero and the grew with the animal to adult size so you can't just regrow a connection like that in an adult. It's theoretically possible, but very very unnatural and complicated.\n\nEdit: For humans I guess the sciatic nerve from the base of the spine to the toes is the longest we got, so for us however long legs get. Other longer/taller animals have even crazier axons that really are multiple meters in length... ",

They're very dense, held back from collapsing into a neutron star by electron degeneracy pressure, which is essentially the repulsion of electrons as they get close to each other (like charges repel).\n\nIf this pressure is overcome, the electrons are pushed into the protons and they become neutrons, creating a neutron star (incidentally, the mass difference between a proton and a neutron is pretty much same as the mass of an electron). Neutron stars are about 10 miles across (!) but have the mass of our sun (or more). A neutron star is as dense as an atomic nucleus - a teaspoon amount of material from a neutron star would weigh as much as Mount Everest. IIRC if a marshmallow impacted the surface of one at the right angle from a few dozen meters high, it would hit with the force of a several hundred kiloton nuclear bomb.\n\nIf the star is massive enough to create iron from fusion in its core (typically blue stars) the star will end in a supernova and create either a neutron star or a black hole, as fusing iron atoms no longer releases energy, but requires energy. This quickly creates an imbalance between the outward force created by fusion and the inward pull of gravity. The outer layers then quickly collapse (in milliseconds) and rebound when they hit the core, causing a supernova. If the core collapses into a black hole before the outer layers come inward, the hole feeds on the star before blowing it apart with two jets of energy at the magnetic poles, creating 70% of gamma ray bursts. The other 30% are from neutron star collisions and are called short gamma ray bursts.\n\nBlack holes are created when neutron degeneracy pressure is overcome, and the core collapses into a singularity, which according to our current math has infinite density because it is a dimensionless point. Since density is mass/volume, density of a dimensionless point is mass/0, which is undefined.\n\nThe large red stars in general are red giants, which can have masses comparable to our sun (main sequence stars). Towards the end of the stars life when there is little hydrogen left to fuse, gravity crushes the core and raises the temperature. The outer layers of the star expand out drastically as they become much less dense due to this temperature increase. Eventually the outer layers will dissipate and leave behind a white dwarf (the core) and a planetary nebula (the outer gasses).\n\nThough some blue stars can actually change to red later in their lifespan depending on their mass and composition. IIRC this is where red hypergiants come from ",

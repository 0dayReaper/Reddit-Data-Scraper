Then physicists started studying them in more depth, and developed classical electromagnetism over two centuries, culminating in Maxwell's field equations (which, incidentally, led to Einstein and his theories of relativity).\n\nSo static electricity and cathode ray tubes predate modern EM theory.",

When either rod is brought in contact with hanging tinsel, the tinsel becomes charged and flares out. The other rod, however, will now attract the tinsel. Touching the tinsel with your hand discharges it.\n\nThese electrostatic forces can also be seen with a conducting balloon. Touching a charged rod to the balloon transfers charge, causing the balloon to be repelled away from the rod.\n\nThe ancient Greeks noticed this phenomenon when rubbing pieces of amber (which pick up a negative electric charge, like our rubber rod). The word \"electricity\" is based on the Greek name for amber: \"elektron.\"\n\n[Rubber and Glass Rods with Tinsel and Balloon](https://youtu.be/NsxhbgCrrSQ)",

You might cut loops out of a plastic shopping bag if you don't have anything better. It should probably be very dry. The charged stick can be a piece of pvc pipe. Any dry plastic that's easily charged works. The charging fur could be a nylon dust mop or any dry fabric especially synthetic. \n\nThere is a product called *Fun Fly Stick* that's a little handheld wand shaped Van de Graaff generator that includes mylar floating forms. It looks like the name brand costs around $35. There are knockoffs for $20 but the sellers look sketchy.\n\nHere's someone with that science toy company showing other things you can do with it like attracting the floater with your other hand and dribbling it between the static generator and your hand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRcpTffhLw4",

Now fix two vertices **p** and **q** of the black triangle T; **p** at the point of tangency between B and B\u2019, and **q** at the other intersection of D with B\u2019. Draw the final vertex **r** such that T is isosceles and its longest side **pr** is parallel^([1]) to D. Now fix the perimeter of T as P(T)=4|D| and roll B\u2019 around B rotating D so that it is always the point of tangency. As B\u2019 travels, T is forced to transform in the way shown. The final vertex **r** traces out the locus of points on the sphere forming a cardioid.\n\n^([1]): Since this is a spherical/elliptic geometry, parallel lines do not exist on the surface. What is actually meant by parallel is that if we fix a latitude longitude coordinate system relative to D as a section of a line of longitude, then **pr** is also a section of a line of longitude.",

Cardioid microphones pick up sound from one direction, and the thick black lines look like they represent points where sound would hit the microphone. It's less effective, obviously, when you sing into a microphone at a side angle, because the waves are parallel rather than perpendicular to the center of the Cardioid. The butt cheek looking shape in the north side would represent the area where you would direct your voice, as it will pick up the widest surface area of the Cardioid.",

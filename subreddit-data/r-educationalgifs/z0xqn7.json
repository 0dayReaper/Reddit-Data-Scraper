    "title": "Allopreening is the mutual preening between two or more birds, the main purpose of which is to reduce instinctive aggression when birds are in close contact. During breeding, allopreening helps to strengthen the pair bond, and among families with young (splendid fairywrens) it creates stronger ties.",

When a bird preens themselves, they will use an oil gland located right above their tail and zip up their feathers, itch their skin, break apart pinfeathers, or clean dirt/bugs off. Allopreening is mostly reserved to the head/neck and the individual is able to preen the rest of themselves.",

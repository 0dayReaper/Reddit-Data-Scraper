You can also spin them really fast to add water to the mix if it's too dry or to dry it up a little bit if it's too wet. Driving the whole way to the job with it spinning too fast, however, will cause the concrete to heat up and dry out.",

It also helps clean out the remaining leftovers by adding a lot of water and flushing the it out in a pit. Big cities have reclaimer plants that will reuse the sand and rock dumped through a pit. Running the drum at high speeds while driving causes flat spots on the wheels nearest the discharge end. Mixing at high speeds will prevent a good mixture as the drum acts like a centrifuge. You want a slower speed to lift the mix up to the top and drop it so it folds in.",

My mental model of what I assumed a concrete mixer look like was a drum with a bunch of angled paddles attached to the walls in it to mix it up.\n\n This diagram is suggesting that there's a giant screw powered by the motor at the lower end, which is completely wrong.\n\nYes, a 2D cut away is hard but this one is drawn plain incorrectly. The chute is depicted as being a solidly connected part of the drum, for instance, and the flutes are not. In reality, it's the opposite way around.\n\nThis could easily be fixed by drawing it correctly. The flute should be the same color as the drum and shown to be connected (connected cross section). A line across the neck of the drum and the chute would show that they are separate. Finally, you could have some sort of animation / diagram cue to show the drum actually rotating.\n\nFor anyone else still confused, this is a real cut away: https://images.gutefrage.net/media/fragen-antworten/bilder/14976598/0_big.jpg?v=1280315650000",

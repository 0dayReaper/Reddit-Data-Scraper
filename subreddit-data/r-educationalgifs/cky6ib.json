If I was spinning a pizza crust and then suddenly hit it on one of its sides, it would form a shape sort of like what you see there. The thing is, instead of a punch from a pizza maker, the force that made the Milky Way wobble was probably a smaller galaxy falling into it. That wobble will continue to propagate through and across the Milky Way, because there\u2019s not a lot of friction between the particles that make it up, so the damping is quite negligible.",

We see spiral galaxies, lenticular, elliptical, and irregular galaxies mostly as flat images. And because our solar system is basically an elliptical system where the planets and sun and moon can long up we probably assumed way too little Z axis. \n\nThe same discovery was made with electron paths. \n\nGalaxies accurately represented in 3D in the future will make our little 2D models look quaint and obviously incorrect.",

Additional fun fact: planetary objects can orbit in whichever direction they fall in, but the most stable orbital systems happen when all of the \"children\" are orbiting in the same direction along the same plane. That's because collisions are less likely to happen in that situation. However, if collisions do occur, it will likely just make all of the involved bodies trend toward the average orbital direction and plane. That's how the more stable systems form in the first place.",

Since the nebula flattens into a disc when it condenses and spins to conserve angular momentum, most of the protoplanets form along the same orbital plane anyway, heading the same direction. Are you saying that generally most of the irregular orbits end up getting filtered out in favor of the more stable model?",

The two galaxies move through each other, all their stars pulling on each other, probably a shitton of star formation going on as gas clouds hit gas clouds. This causes orbits to be pulled out of whack.\n\nThe other big one you see in the picture is Andromeda, which is very faint, but if it wasn't you'd be able to see [very cleary that it's huge](http://i.imgur.com/jFynSH4.png). It's going to hit us in about 4.5 billion years.\n\nThe second one is either a computer simulation or a digital representation of actual data, we can't exactly fly a camera a million light years out to get a regular photo of it, but that's what is currently happening, and will continue to be currently happening for millions of years to come. This stuff happens slowly.",

Now think if that planet were on the edge of a galaxy and, maybe, say, in a galactic collision like that which caused the Milky Way's irregular \"waves,\" it was flung outward, away from the galactic center, meaning it's flying through intergalactic space. The only visible objects, in the absence of galaxy-bound stars, would be galaxies close enough to produce faint light in an otherwise forever pitch-black sky, and those galaxies would grow dimmer over a universe's timescale. \n\nTheir cosmic models would be so drastically different from how ours developed through history, without a web of shining points to populate the blackness of space. \n\nNeat to think of what one would see while standing on the surface of one of these \"galaxy-less,\"  starless rogue planets.",

For example, in topological terms, (the surface of) a torus (donut) can be flat, even though it has local curvature. If the dimensions of the torus are just right, all the curves cancel each other out when you sum it up across the whole surface, making the overall surface flat. A sphere on the other hand can't be flat, as the curvature is positive across the whole surface, so it doesn't cancel out.",

Now think if that planet were on the edge of a galaxy and, maybe, say, in a galactic collision like that which caused the Milky Way's irregular \"waves,\" it was flung outward, away from the galactic center, meaning it's flying through intergalactic space. The only visible objects, in the absence of galaxy-bound stars, would be galaxies close enough to produce faint light in an otherwise forever pitch-black sky, and those galaxies would grow dimmer over a universe's timescale. \n\nTheir cosmic models would be so drastically different from how ours developed through history, without a web of shining points to populate the blackness of space. \n\nNeat to think of what one would see while standing on the surface of one of these \"galaxy-less,\"  starless rogue planets.",

There are thousands upon thousands of solar-systems between us and the \"sides\" of the disc. To put it in perspective the Milky Way is 100,000 light-years in diameter, and 1000 light-years thick. So with that in mind, know that when you look at the river of stars in that night's sky, you're seeing a massive amalgamation of stars from all over the galaxy. Of which, most aren't even remotely close to each other, despite how it may seem. So that is probably why it looks like a flat straight line, that amount of stars from so many different distances away produces an image that *looks* flat, but is truly wavy when viewed from a better vantage point.\n\n\nThat, or the sheer distances we're talking here or so amazingly large our humans eyes can't even come close to detecting the shape of the galaxy. Like trying to see the curvature of the Earth.",

It makes sense for above to be as below. Just like how the geometric/angular structure of crystals simply mirrors the crystal formation the actual atoms themselves take, even though the crystal is trillions and trillions of these atoms. It doesn't seem like below would mirror above, it just seems far too simple, yet that's exactly what we see everywhere.",

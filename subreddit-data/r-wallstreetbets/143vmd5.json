So to avoid getting robbed by Theta gang, you close the trade less than halfway to the expiration date. \n\nWhen the price is volatile, there is greater probability of an OTM option moving ITM. So Vega gang gets you when the price is stable and OTM because there is less probability of the option moving ITM. \n\nIntrinsic value is in the price difference.

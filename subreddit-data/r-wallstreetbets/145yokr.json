Like if everyone had their own personal subreddit and you get to choose who to network with.\n\nI think the problem is the potential to create little bubbles of\u2026 really shitty people and echo chambers that can easily block out differing views BUT that\u2019s an issue on every social media site it seems\u2026 and in a perfect internet they\u2019re a neat idea and can absolutely be utilized for good\n\nIf anyone\u2019s interested in it, a good place to start is the program Obsidian and the community plug-in called \u201cDigital Garden\u201d that uses Vercel and GitHub to turn your personal wiki/note taking canvas app in to a \u201cwebsite\u201d\n\nEdit: the comment below nailed it. This is literally what \u201cdigital gardens\u201d are: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring\nThe modern version just has a good dash of World Anvil and Milanote in its skin with a focus on \u201caesthetics\u201d. I can see how someone would think Facebook from my description but that\u2019s not exactly right. Just editing my comment because I do think it\u2019s a neat way an old piece of the internet is being revitalized, and I didn\u2019t mean to give it the wrong idea :)\n\nAs I said in another comment.. you could ultimately say Facebook is a watered down webring by its definition but at that point so is Reddit or Tumblr or any other similar site. It\u2019s much more customizable though, it\u2019s very free, and your data is much more protected and it can be what you want it to [without having an algorithm that forces your engagement through negativity](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/social-media-facebook-twitter-politics-b1870628.html) ~ like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.",

He can't possibly transition his app that fast, as mentioned in his most recent post. And with the whole Reddit falsely accusing him of blackmail, it's pretty unlikely anything will work out between them",

They\u2019re never users, so of course they never experience the consequences of their decisions. \n\nNew Reddit\u2019s use of screen space looks exactly like Fidelity\u2019s new UI (which I can no longer opt-out of). Large font, phone like aspect ratio (even on wide monitors), *tons* of wasted white space, and fewer items visible on screen at a time. It\u2019s horrible.\n\nWe actually had a UI/UX specialist on my work team and she didn\u2019t make it a year before she was let go for consistently terrible input. For example, she was demanding we stop using commas in numbers, despite the fact we work in figures 11-digits long.",

The truth is that a competent executive team act as a gate to company success. They aren\u2019t usually responsible for the value being there, but they are the ones at the wheel responsible for the value being delivered and made available. A perfect company product-wise with crap leadership will not work well. The value generated by a thousand employees can be wiped out by one bad CEO decision. What we\u2019re seeing here is why CEOs and executives are paid so much: because their fuckups render value inaccessible and shareholders want to disincentivize that. Few founders remain CEOs from founding through IPO. The skills necessary to build a startup and the skills necessary to run a publicly traded company are different. Startup founders need to find a way to create value. Once value is created, the hard part of extracting it starts. There\u2019s overlap of course, but few founders can do both. \n\nReddit has a remarkable amount of value in terms of user community and content curation. I am always hesitant to publicly comment on business matters that I can\u2019t claim to be fully informed on. After the AMA disaster, I\u2019ve seen enough. u/spez has broadcast the inability of him and his team to extract and deliver value even when compared to numerous 3rd party app developers. Upon IPO, people buying shares will be buying from people who previously invested and want to cash out. The issue now is that anyone buying at IPO will realize that u/spez does not have a plan to extract value. They aren\u2019t profitable and don\u2019t seem to have a plan to become profitable. \n\nCurrent investors are probably blowing up his phone. Their IPO liferaft for finally getting their ROI after years of waiting may have just been destroyed. We\u2019re talking hundreds of millions of investment potentially down the drain.\n\nI\u2019m not familiar with how much board voting power u/spez has, but I imagine he\u2019s flipping out at the idea of being ousted. \n\nThere are ways out of this on the corporate side, but the value of Reddit is and always has been on the community and this has been a systemic destruction of that value as they plan to enter an IPO. If I had to guess, their IPO will either drop like a brick before stabilizing for a bit at ~1/4th their IPO price or they \u201cdelay\u201d the IPO for \u201cbetter market conditions\u201d.",

I checked my ads right now on r/cars and r/anime and both have same random steam games that have nothing to do with cars or anime, some local bank and random investment shit. Like why would i ever think about clicking those ads i don't even browse any investment subreddits. Now imagine if i was on r/cars and there were ads for cars, traveling, car parts, car cleaning products, car games etc and same for r/anime if there was some anime dvd, manga, figurines, anime games... Like you have a platform with  communities with 1M+ people who are about specific things and you are still incapable to give them targeted ads. I am not a businesses expert, but in my book this is colossal failure.",

He chastises, lies, and acts like a total asshole. One of his only responses is \u201cwe will continue to act profit driven until we are profitable.\u201d\n\n*this is an astoundingly bad answer.* For one, this is maybe the stupidest thing you can say to your audience. For two, shocking nobody, Reddit has lost sight of any purpose or values they had. \n\nThey\u2019ve made the mistake of thinking companies exist to make money which is wrong. Companies exist to offer a service or product. If the service or product is good and correctly differentiated or cost effective, they make money. This motherfucker is stripping away the only things that differentiates this site from any other!\n\nThis site is good for three things: subreddit community cultivation, niche specific information, and scrolling.\n\nThey\u2019ve made super clear with their shithouse of an app that they only care about scrolling and the user base who does so. Here\u2019s the problem - this is the least important and differentiated feature of reddit. It can be easily replaced with just about any other social media site. Also these users do not seem to give a shit about reddit.\n\nFuck u/spez forever and FWIW, check out Lemmy. Specifically, I\u2019ve enjoyed Beehaw so far. Signing up and figuring it out reminds me of when I tried to figure out reddit 12 years ago, the content was interesting and I actually got a pretty good feed going last night. There is a beta iOS app as well - that literally has better sorting than the official reddit app. u/spez - you are the biggest joke I\u2019ve ever encountered, you sold out your site and cannot lead a company out of a paper bag. I hope you get everything you deserve with these absolute diarrhea of business decisions.",

Uber isn't profitable yet and has been a publically traded company for years. \n\nI posted this on another thread, but feel like it may be pertinent here too:\n\n&gt;\tLet me clear up front and say I'm a die hard Apollo user and 110% on the \"fuck u/spez\" bandwagon - and will be quitting Reddit on the 30th after 15 years once Apollo goes away rather than migrating to the native experience. \n\n&gt;But...\n\n&gt;Comments like this sort of demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the economies at play here and what it takes to drive towards profitability. While the API calls in question absolutely do not constitute the type of hard cost that Reddit is claiming they do, the massive number of users who only access Reddit content via 3p apps and can't be monetized by Reddit since those apps don't serve ads do ultimately become a net-loss for Reddit. Anyone accessing content hosted on Reddit will contribute some sort of nominal cost, and when multiplied by some number of millions of users adds up. \n\n&gt;To drive towards profitability, reddit can do 2 things. 1 - find a way to monetize those users (by doing things like charging 3p apps for the data/content consumed by their users... Which is what they're trying to do here by charging for API access); or 2 - \"fire\" those users, which is, from a practical standpoint, what they're doing by blacklisting 3p apps like Apollo. All those users may quit Reddit, but those users represented an un-recouperable cost to reddit anyway, so getting rid of them lowers costs. That helps them become more profitable. \n\n&gt;Now, here's the rub - as Christian even acknowledged, had the API costs been within the realm of reasonability, he would have gladly paid them. Reddit could have made money to cover costs (or likely even net out positive), and all would have been gucci. Instead, they chose the nuclear option. To me, that implies they ran the analysis and decided that firing all the die-hard 3p app users was the best (read: \"most profitable\") course of action. They seem to believe that most of these users won't actually quit Reddit, but will instead use the official app or website, and therefore will ultimately be monetized. \n\n&gt;What remains to be seen is if people will actually leave in droves, or if we have a very vocal minority who will but the others do stick around. If the latter ends up being the case, then Reddits decision here, while despicable, is likely the best for-profit business decision.",

Which you have also pointed out.\n\nIt seems like a huge risk on reddit's part to alienate those users and force them to use an app they clearly do not care to use. The calculus on converting those users must be super hand-wavey because by the admins own admission, they do not use 3rd party apps.",

The one fatal thing that all these companies are forgetting is that there are some users that just aren\u2019t going to make you money no matter what you do. The people that use Adblock and telemetry blocking. People pirate shit or use various ways around paywalls. Companies always bang their heads against the wall trying to make sure they get 100% of the user base making them money and in the process fuck everything up that made the site great in the first place. Just accept that some people are getting your shit for free. Count them as a user in your numbers and move on. \nBut the problem is that we\u2019re all just numbers in the first place to them, so it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll figure it out.",

    "postText": "Discover Bank is reporting earnings on July 19 2023 afterhours. \n\nBecause they declined my credit card dispute, I have huge hatred on them. Nevertheless, experienced speculators of the stock market understand that this stock never goes down no matter how hard people try to short it. \n\nCredit Card delinquencies are expected to be 5.8% of all accounts YoY and do not buy options going into earnings. The best strategy would be to buy out of the money call options immediately after market open on July 20 2023 to capitalize on the cheap options prices and the upward trend the market would experience in response to Discover's lackluster earnings.",

I believe I am not the only one and many must have lost more because of a random dude's analysis online.\n\nThen he just disappears from the face of the earth and the WSB life goes on. \n\nI don't think there is a way to vet OP's past performance.\n\nWhat make you trust a post or not?",

Check everything.\n\nAlso, that's true for all media and all people who give you any kind of financial or market advice. Turn CNBC on for a morning... it's all the same. Random people taking guesses based on a combination of personally chosen factors. Yeah, some of them have insider information and massive staffs and stupid-fast connections to the exchanges...  and private exchanges, too...\n\n...but they're still just basically guessing based on the information available to them, and they're regularly wrong, and sometimes even more tragically wrong than the worst plays on here.\n\nWhat use is the sub?\n\nWell, if you learn to mine the nuggets, you can actually learn a lot on here. There's enough discussion that at least you start getting exposed to the things that people are generally anxious about, or pick up information on options, etc... but you just have to weed through the bullshit to get there. Some of the DD really is pretty good, and some of it's awful.\n\nI didn't touch FRC because I knew it was in that position because it wasn't financially stable and that's all a bank really has, but it wouldn't be the first time that a bank like that got bailed out and recovered. People were hoping for a reversal of gravity, so it was a very risky trade.\n\nSurely you know a failing bank is a risky trade, right?\n\nNo? Well, now you do... that's true for most of the plays on here, and even the good ones you can still get wrong. That's the game, and it's the game we all play.\n\nDon't think about the sub as a leader, think about it as a place where you go to get ideas... even if they're stupid or crazy. But treat it all as stupid and crazy until you learn otherwise. :)\n\nOne last thought: Never underestimate the lessons learned and the value of failure. This place will give you plenty of those lessons, and you should absolutely use them to learn what your trading style is.",

Considering that there are a lot of highly regarded individuals in this sub, there's so many people that a few of them will, on occasion, actually share legitimate insight. I don't get plays from the post saying \"PLTR to the moon\", if I get a play it's going to be from some guy in the comments of a post talking about how copper futures were undervalued due to supply chain issues that the market wasn't accounting for. If you can't read through the comments and determine who these people (the ones who know what they're talking about) are, then good luck, and don't take advice from someone who uses too many emojis.",

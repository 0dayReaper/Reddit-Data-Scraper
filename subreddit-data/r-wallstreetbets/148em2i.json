It's clear that bull markets have been getting longer and longer over the past few decades, while bear markets have become shorter and less frequent. This is likely due to the increasing stability of the global economy, as well as the advance of technology which has made it easier for investors to make money in rising markets and protect their capital in falling ones.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI bought some BioNTech stock not long ago as the hype has worn off, so it's not overpriced anymore, but I believe that they will go places with their technology and all the products they have in their pipeline. \\[1\\]\n\nToday I noticed an ususual spike of +4,4 %, so I checked the news for something positive but instead found that BioNTech is facing lawsuits in Germany for alleged covid vaccine side effects. \\[2\\]\n\nI'm living in Germany and know all the crazy dynamics about the COVID vaccinacion, so I am very sure that those claims are pure bullshit. But still they are in the news, so I'm surprised that the stock went up instead of down, which I would have expected.\n\nA) One thing I can think of why this happened is that the news coverage brought BioNTech back into a lot of retail investor's minds who then decided to buy some stock (because they also think that the legal claims are bullshit).\n\nB) The other thing I could imagine is that professonal investors (who expect that the legal claims are bullshit) might hope for more news coverage which will lead to the above effect.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWould it be wise to take the wins and sell because the short term effect A will wear off soon) ? Or invest more because the long term effect B might still come?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: some sources:\n\n\\[1\\]: [https://www.biontech.com/de/de/home/pipeline-and-products/pipeline.html](https://www.biontech.com/de/de/home/pipeline-and-products/pipeline.html)\n\n\\[2\\]: [https://www.google.com/finance/quote/22UA:ETR?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrjZHV3cD\\_AhVpg\\_0HHY-3CkMQ3ecFegQIMxAf](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/22UA:ETR?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrjZHV3cD_AhVpg_0HHY-3CkMQ3ecFegQIMxAf)",

The legal claims are probably bullshit, but investors might still be cautious about buying the stock until more information is released.\n\nB) If professional investors believe that the legal claims are bullshit, then they may be hoping for more news coverage to drive up the stock price so they can sell at a profit. However, if the news coverage turns out to be negative and starts affectingBioNTech's business, then their investment could quickly turn sour.",

There's just a very loud fraction of people who doesn't care for science.\n\nSo IMHO the lawsuit will turn out as a massive PR campaign for BioNTech which eventually even give the \"legally approved\" sticker to the vaccine and the overall tech.",

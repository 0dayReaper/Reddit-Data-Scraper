Hoping Adobe will continue a decent run into late this week. Rate hike discussion on Wednesday which will be interesting. Glad to see some gains and again will be pulling out slightly tomorrow. Also position: ADBE $500 6/23 Calls x39 Stay healthy out here!",

These are still otm also so they have no value after earnings unless Adbe rockets up another $40.\n\nOne options with a small chunk of them is to roll out a month or two atm and sell Calls expiring this week atm. The premium will probably be enough to pay for the additional cost. I would only do this with a couple. If Adobe drops you have enough time for it to recover. If it continues up you roll out this week's short Call to your long call and up as many strikes as you can for a credit.",

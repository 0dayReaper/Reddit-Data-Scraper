But I am going to bet that the margins on that legal weed is razor thin because they have to still compete with the illegal weed from the corner boy that everyone is still smoking. Plus those dispensaries buying and reselling the legal weed has to pay so much in permits and fees it's almost not worth it when the corner boy probably has a cheaper price.",

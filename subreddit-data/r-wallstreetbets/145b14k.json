Some places are upfront about outside sourcing some places aren\u2019t.\n\nThat said buy O\u2019reillys. They\u2019ve been building an insanely broad proprietary manufacturing base, they\u2019re going to absolutely murder the other in-person retailers over the next decade. Jmo",

It looks like they were doing better on paying off long term debt, and then went \"Lol, nope!\".\n\nLong term debt in a rising rate environment, falling income, and lack of growth prospect is probably what's causing this sell off.

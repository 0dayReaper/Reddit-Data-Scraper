My van is long paid for, and I bought it at a time when Chrysler sold a lifetime bumper to bumper (100$ deductible).  So I've really only downgraded to \"A\" car - but could theoretically drive the mini with the broken window if needed.\n\nSo yeah - downgrading to a \"few\" cars - if you wanna call it that - is the choice here..",

Now I would have liked to see a little extra pump on the VIX but I will take the double bottom as a sign of a bounce and new demand tomorrow\u2026\n\nMy bold prediction is that SPY will break below $400 within the next 30-45 days. I personally am targeting $395 by July 7th\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02xmo3vc1o4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=35f28b150283b8614bc9f4f90cf6b8442e932683\n\nAfter a perfect double top off 429.62 (Mondays HOD) we officially finally got a new supply in at 428.13\u2026 that means our target with the daily DMI waving down should be 422.04. \n\nIF we drop to 422.04 and take out that supply then we will look for a new higher demand to be put in before we go long again. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fugmd1bd1o4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f119dd65bc8b13a39a464bf8c1bd09acd91416f2\n\nI don\u2019t usually zoom in this much on my daily chart but today I found it is necessary... so that you guys could see the inverse head and shoulder I am seeing here\u2026 what I see here is we pumped from 418 up to this 429.62 resistance on Monday\u2026 came back down to support at 426.6 then retested and rejected 429.62 again\u2026 with that rejection and now a bearish engulfing daily candle I am looking for minimally a 422.92 gap fill but I could see spy retesting 418-422 by EOW. \n\nNow there is a chance we could bounce off the daily 8ema but more likely than not the daily 20ema would be the sell off target. \n\nSPY DAILY LEVELS  \n Supply- 422.04 -&gt; 428.13 -&gt; 429.68  \n Demand- 414.55 -&gt; 410.2  \n Support- 426.5 -&gt; 424.5 -&gt; 422.1  \n Resistance- 428.4 -&gt; 429.6 -&gt; 431.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yf226mrd1o4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a960e69c0e33aa9fa13bdc9bf13798f6d1cb056c\n\nFutures also put n a new daily supply today at 4292 with a daily DMI wave down\u2026 with this double top and bearish engulfing daily candle I will be looking for bears to take out the 4240 supply\u2026 IF we lose that then next big support comes in at 4188 demand. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhc8yx7e1o4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4bbdd566276a8e558521bfeb8d7addec6356f2ca\n\nFutures with an impressive pattern here\u2026 double top -&gt; double bottom with bullish engulfing candle -&gt; double top with bearish engulfing candle\u2026 \n\nWith this double top and new daily supply I really do favor downside here\u2026 I am looking for a drop to minimally 4260\u2026 if we lose that support then we start to target the next big support area of 4232 to 4240. \n\nIn the off chance the bulls some how come back with a double bottom again tomorrow then we have a major resistance to watch at 4293. \n\nFUTURES DAILY LEVELS  \n Supply- 4240 -&gt; 4292 -&gt; 4312  \n Demand- 4188 -&gt; 4157  \n Support- 4274 -&gt; 4260 -&gt; 4232  \n Resistance- 4293 -&gt; 4311\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/626y52pe1o4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6103a9e0537e1f0daef6e89f5e8ccb0bc967478c\n\nNow as I have said for the last few days I thought QQQ was the better short and boy do I wish I would have played it\u2026 QQQ officially after its new supply at 354.95 we have officially taken our supply at 352.8\u2026\n\nWe now have a really nice 354.95 to 357.09 supply area\u2026 from here being that QQQ closed below its daily 8ema and continues to show weakness on the daily DMI I will actually be looking for at least one more day of downside tomorrow. I am looking for QQQ to retest the daily 20ema for the first time since May 5th. I do see a potential to take our 337.6 supply but that will be a big reach and would have to trickle over into Friday\u2026 \n\nThat level would be right around 342 tomorrow\u2026 With this yellow bull channel being broken its possible that we could actually see an even more sustained sell off on QQQ and tech as a whole\u2026 IF you look at tech today besides TSLA we actually are looking extremely weak and TECH absolutely led this sell off today. \n\nQQQ DAILY LEVELS  \n Supply- 337.6 -&gt; 354.95 -&gt; 357.09  \n Demand- 347.93 -&gt; 336.37\n\n**BONUS TESLA DAILY** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8x770af1o4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=775e68cffd35805aa8f19b5511749fce4fd85642\n\nSo I don\u2019t always include TSLA here but a few people ask for it often so I follow it a lot\u2026 well this week I I was looking for a breakout to $228\u2026 why? Well because the weekly had finally closed over the 100ema and the key 208.22 resistance it held for almost 6 months\u2026\n\nMy upside target was $228 resistance on the weekly but that also was the daily supply of 229.97\u2026 \n\nToday we hit that level and closed out a real nice bearish abandoned baby reversal candle\u2026 for those of you who know me its my favor pattern\u2026 This could with a daily DMI waving down and establishing a $221.27 supply today (shows imbalance) lead to a open under $221.27 tomorrow\u2026 I actually have a target of $217.5 for tomorrow for the bears\u2026 but minimally I am looking for $221.27\u2026 \n\nHowever, in the off chance that TSLA bounces here then $229.97 is still major resistance and from there we look for 242-250 next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/npy65mpf1o4b1.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=08e534bbbf9172c6f3e00f5506264d9616047523\n\nIt aint much but I did do a small overnight lotto put\u2026 Ive already hit my weekly profits goal and sometimes if I feel convicted I like to take a small lotto play\u2026 If it all goes wrong then its not the end of the world\u2026 \n\n**VIX**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53vnjl5g1o4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c08b63f73f75ffb76f248d24269d45b0d2e383e3\n\nNow this morning I was pretty darn excited about the VIX\u2026 why? Because when we were holding over the 14.2 level we actually were ready to put in a new daily demand (support) that would give the VIX at least a move up to the $16 level and possibly the $19.5 level which would perfectly coincide with the FG index and also bearish daily chart I am seeing for SPY, QQQ and ES. \n\nWe did however get a nice daily double bottom at 13.94. So if we were to close somewhere close to 14.2 or higher tomorrow we likely will turn this 13.94 double bottom into a new daily demand. \n\nHowever, in the off chance we continue to range on SPY or the bulls surprise everyone tomorrow we likely will see yet again another new 52 week low\u2026 at this point if the bulls want to get SPY over 430 I am fairly convinced that we need to see the VIX either in the 12s or we need a pretty large bounce on the VIX followed by another multi week sell off like we just had. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sogis5kg1o4b1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=387cce8011951bc32f02c166b4db718eb444f36c\n\nToday was a really rollercoaster of a day\u2026 started the morning off pretty rough then was really slaying it coming into that 2pm time frame\u2026 and that honestly is where I lost it all\u2026 well I closed green but I gave up a lot of profits the last 2 hours of the day\u2026 \n\nSPY found itself chopping in an 34 cent range from basically 145 until 330\u2026 there were a lot of convincing bull and bear traps and I definitely as you see bought into all of them\u2026 honestly this morning I really struggled because VOLD and VIX were not really matching SPY price action\u2026 and then EOD from basically 2pm until close it was the same thing\u2026 the put got wrecked then I was in a call that looked absolutely perfect\u2026 VOLD was pumping and the VIX was making a new 52 week low\u2026 but for some reason 427 was an absolute brick wall and no matter how convincing it looked like it was going to close over it\u2026 it rejected every time\u2026 \n\nStill a green day and still a great week of trading but definitely frustrating giving back profits EOD\u2026 I need to go back to my rule of no matter what not trading PH.",

[screenshot.](https://i.imgur.com/nPxo8Vo.png)\n\nI said I was going to wait for it to push higher like the last two times in 2022 &amp; 2020 before shorting for a 5-10% correction. Part of my reasoning was this divergence, debt ceiling getting raised thus flooding the mkt with treasuries and the JPM collar. Currently that's at 4320 and 3860? A 10% drop from 4300 should bring it close to there.\n\nWill it happen? Idk but I'll be ready to ride my puts if it does happen. And I'll buy that 3800 dip so hard if it does come thru",

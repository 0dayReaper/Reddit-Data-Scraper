I don't really know where, but it's going to provide serious action.\n\nI don't have the time to give you all the DD, that most of you don't deserve, but I will provide you with one snip below. This is unsustainable. The shorts will either win, or they will get absolutely decimated. I've been playing this thing long for a few months. I'm going to continue to play it long. If you think I'm an idiot, feel free to put your money where your mouth is. &lt;insert some joke about somebody's girlfriend's boyfriend&gt; Smart money would probably be playing this both directions, but I'm sticking 100% oriented to the heavens. This stock cannot stay at $40/share. Pick your direction, have fun.  \n\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iqwksptx3t5b1.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e31705e14d1cdbfaf6f4cc2a3f98733b69dc57ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crcbc9wr3t5b1.png?width=1435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c2140fdd98073937d6bfc73fb5994245a1992f5a",

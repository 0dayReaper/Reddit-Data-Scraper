If she did it on multiple occasions, each occasion would be separately charged, each occasion with several different charges, some redundant. Steal from the state via 50 fake checks and you can get 200 felonies easily. \n\nConversely, robbing a bank is one act at one time. \n\nNow, how the sentencing would work in the first scenario is uncertain, I.e. concurrent or consecutive sentences, any enhancements, etc. But generally speaking society has decided its worse to on multiple occasions decide to steal from state programs rather than to rob a bank.",

Their earnings report is coming up soon and it'll be interesting to see how they're doing. Some game developers and hobbyists have been turning to other tools instead of Adobe, so it could potentially have an impact on their earnings. Just something to keep in mind! $ADBE",

Speaking of which, have you guys noticed the recent shift from Adobe to other tools like Stable Diffusion and Mid-Journey?

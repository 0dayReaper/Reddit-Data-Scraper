It never crosses their minds that Apple have their own tech, AMD is making theirs and that giant corps like Microsoft and google have been developing their own plans for bespoke silicon based on ARM architectures for years now. Microsoft is not going to rely on Nvidia for their cloud services, Nvidia are a notorious arsehole in the tech industry and have burned bridges with nearly everyone they've done business with, Microsoft learned from their experience with the OG Xbox that Nvidia is not a trustworthy or professional business partner in the hardware space.",

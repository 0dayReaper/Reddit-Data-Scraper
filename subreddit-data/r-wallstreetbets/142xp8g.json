NGMI. It\u2019s Over. \n\nSeriously and don\u2019t be weird abot it.\n\nEdit: your charts and lines are shit. Stop it.",

            "comment": "In the financial world what you just posted is actually illegal according to both SEC and NASAA rules. \n\nThe reason being is because it gives the illusion of success. \n\nHowever, we must list all performance not in the last year and all winners and losers, net gains, and for a specific time frame. \n\nThe entirety of the stock market has traded flat for the first 6 months of the year barring 6-8 high moving stocks that make up all growth across all sectors and markets. These stocks now hold weight of some 30-40% in all of the indexs. The whole point of an index is for it be equal weight so that if apple posts a missed revenue and weak guidance and drops 30% that it doesn't tank growth for the next 3 years on your index fund investments. \n\nAlmost every other stock in the market including real money makers that have solid balance sheets and recession proof products or services are trading 40% lower than they were a year ago. \n\nSo there are two big points to make here. \n\n1. You cherry picked data and used recent massive run ups in the last 3-4 weeks as your primary data source to say we are going to continue to go up. Which is stupid but also would be illegal if you were in finance. \n\n2. It's ironic that you don't realize the statement you just made is the perfect illustration as to why we will crash a good 20-30% and it's going to be almost entirely the stocks you just mentioned. \n\nNvidia is trading at 200 times its earnings. In a normal market with the absolute highest potential growth a PE ratio should never exceed 80-90. 80 quarters is 20 years. That's fucking insane. A normal PE ratio for a good growth company and solid balance sheet is normally 24. \n\nTesla at 64\nMicrosoft at 36\nApple at 30\nGoogle at 28 \n\n\nSo you can see how Google, apple and Microsoft are way closer to that normal PE ratio and have huge fortresses of a balance sheet. If they take a haircut of 10% each they'll be at market value. Because those 3 have a weight of close to 15% of the spy, the spy will take a haircut to about 385. When Tesla and Nvidia come back to earth, that's what you're gonna see spy hit 350s. This all assumes the rest of the market stays flat. Which of course it won't. \n\n\nWe are in the fomo greed cycle at the very end before a big hit. Stay cash and get ready to play the ups and downs for the next year.",

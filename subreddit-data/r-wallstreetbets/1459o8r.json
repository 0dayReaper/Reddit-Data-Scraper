    "postText": "***Some symbols are being floated around lately as \"short squeezes\". Why do you think these squeezes rally up the prices? Adversely, why do you not think this is simply the activity from daily traders on WSB driving up the price?*** **In reality, it's possible that everyone involved is simply squeezing each other in a buying rally.**\n\nDid you know that short interest gets reported only twice a month? Short interests of today, for example, will be published on June 29th, 20 days from now. Read the rules for yourself:  \n[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)\n\nSo yes, whatever it is your favorite squeeze ticker, the shorting data you see online is so stale, and yes a rally in the stock price will lead short sellers to be margin called. But do you think the institutional shorters will wait that long? How do you know that institutional shorters haven't close their short positions already while some apes are buying the rally?\n\nTrying to really get to the bottom of what this subreddit thinks and how it sources its short interest data. Looking for all kinds of answers.",

It's a straight-up buying frenzy, that's especially dangerous without any new information.\n\nRemember, the goal of a short seller is to cover their position and close it forever, the goal of a new buyer is (hopefully) to sell that stock later at a profit. Unless, you think they're burning money for the heck of it.\n\nYou tell me, if it's all the same, why aren't people here squeezing any stock regardless of short interest numbers? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)",

There's simply no point of diminishing returns at some point.\n\nHowever, what I meant when I said \"the goal of a short seller is to cover their position\" - this is in the context of it being a failed bet. If the stock goes sky high like some of the meme stocks, a short seller will simply close it at a loss, hence, they're the ones paying out higher stock prices, and financing crazy returns on options.\n\nIf it's simply a buying rally, it's us, the retail investors, who are sponsoring the ever higher price. It's a huge distinction to make and I'm impressed there's no interest in making this distinction.",

Short interst not going tell me where a million other traders cover price is.  He might be hedged and decide to double down and sell more.",

Would you explain why traders here prefer to short squeeze stocks that has a high short interest compared to float / daily volume?\n\nI mean, if it makes no difference, we can technically \"short squeeze\" or \"rally buy\" any stock. Doesn't matter who gets hurt, right?\n\nYour logic on \"hedging and doubling down\" is inexplainable and I think makes no sense. Please explain to me how to hedge the short? By going long? By marrying it with a call option to become a synthetic put? Explain please how this magic hedge works because obviously we're all interested in doing it haha.",

Wouldn\u2019t that protect your short shares from a run up.  Omg yes it would.  Then I could just roll that call up for a credit and use it to short more shares.  Omg. Amazing. I love all these genius in wsb that don\u2019t know how to protect their position.  It makes me feel like expert",

So, in all of these cases, it's not exactly a hedge, it's a change from their short position into a capped options play.\n\nThe difference between what we both say is:  \n1) the reported open short interest may not even change  \n2) some of these shorts we see among the most bought stocks will represent option market making activity.\n\nEither way, the goal of a firm opening a \"hedged\" short position by your definition through a reverse collar, has to be done before the underlying price moves dramatically. This is, in fact, not equivalent to the goal of a firm short selling in general, which intends to profit from the short and not from a synthetic put option.\n\nIn conclusion, I stand corrected on the fact that there will be short interest, but I still think that this is not what most shorting firms naturally start with. This is practically option market making.",

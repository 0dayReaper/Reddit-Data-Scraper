    "postText": "This is my third follow up post on my IWM September 15, 210 strike calls with an average purchase price of about 25 cents with commissions which are high at Morgan Stanley.  I recommended this a few weeks ago when I placed this trade and was met with anger and mockery.  1717 contracts were purchased for $42717 (25 cents with commissions) and 1717 contracts sold for net $181,227.  850 at 1.10, 867 at 1.05.  Commissions from trade were around 5k.  Pics below of last screenshot from morgan account before sale and both sales.",

    "postText": "In short, don\u2019t forget how inflation factors into the market. The \u201cbull run\u201d has been more of an \u201cinflation run\u201d than anything else. The money printing had to go somewhere / inflation had to drive up something, and I believe this years run up has been basically caused by that more than any AI hype. \n\nThe last all-time high of SPY was back in December 2021 at $474.96, which is $516.80 in todays dollars. In other words, we are still down 16.5% in valuation from the high. Based on that reference, SPY today is still at $396.48 in 2021 dollars. There is still room to go up. \n\nThis is a bubble, I am still net bearish, but keep in mind that the inflation we experienced between 2010 and 2020 is the same as the inflation between 2020 and 2023. Until the market prices in the end of high inflation, prices will likely continue to look bigger on paper. \n\nDCAing into QQQ while accumulating long-term debit spreads is the move.",

Since most of the growth has come from tech, the market won\u2019t contract unless tech contracts. I\u2019m not sure what the catalyst for that will be; possibly lowered valuations based on their commercial real estate assets or the AI bubble running out of steam?\n\nTimeline is impossible to predict hence the only hedge being long term QQQ debit spreads",

So price of goods and commodities go up, people spend less, economy doesn\u2019t have as much money flowing, and boom. One domino falls (likely housing sector) and the contagion takes everything with it. So if anything, this is the moment investors are simply pushing the markets up to adjust their gains for inflation before the fun money party stops.",

With $4trillion added extra to the economy since 2020, most of the money will eventually end up in a private equity stock portfolio, driving up on-paper demand when the company doesn\u2019t ACTUALLY add any more value.",

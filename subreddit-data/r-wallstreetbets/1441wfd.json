Let's say $7 calls and the underlying price goes up, could you risk the chance of some one not buying your option? Like if it's deep in the money and the spreads pretty big. Would it be possible that it might not sell?\n\nI've only really traded spy where there is a ton of interest and spreads are pretty close so I was skeptical about making a move on this.",

Usually a penny or 2 per contract. A few times it took a couple minutes to fill but not bad. And with the recent volume there are a lot more options buyers and sellers right now",

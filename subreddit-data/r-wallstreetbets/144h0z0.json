We completely redesigned how our process facilities operated. There were a lot of \"good luck getting a robot to do this manual labor thing\" ... And we just redesigned the facilities to not include those types of things any longer.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Our goal wasn't to explicitly replace human labor. Our goal was to increase operating efficiencies and boost production. Turns out, removing the operator is one of the most efficient ways to boost production. The humans running the machines weren't actually doing it correctly.",

You\u2019d really want to learn, and then leverage your knowledge of electrical theory and code to get off your tools sooner rather than later though. As long as you\u2019re in decent shape, the physical aspect won\u2019t be beyond you after it kicks your ass for the first month or so. Ladders will work your legs and core, a lot of wiring will hit your shoulders, but it\u2019ll keep you in shape\n\nShow maturity, communication skills, organization, and responsibility to start giving orders rather than taking them. Being older might help you with that. \n\nWhile I\u2019m not union, your Local might be looking for someone just like you, and offer great benefits. At the same time, there\u2019s currently tons of competition in the non union field. You just need to make yourself worth the money. People are paying, you just need to put in the work. At your age, you\u2019ll want to put in as much as you can as early as you can to shoot for a supervisor/foreman role. Just give off that vibe and try to live up to it.

In the 40's the inputs to the factory were basically raw metals and a few finished goods like tires. In the 2010's the factory's inputs were subassemblies that had already been assembled at another factory and the parts used for those subassemblies had been assembled at a dozen suppliers who got the parts for their assemblies from a hundred parts suppliers. The supply chain is just enormously big and complicated now with dozens of suppliers finding economies of scale by specializing in one tiny piece of the larger product.",

For the factory of the future that regularly employees 40 people (doing the work of what was a 400 person factory) is going to need approximately 360 individuals for a 1-2 week period each year to do major repair and retrofits. So if you get a opportunity to get in early on a mobile repair company for these highly automated factories it could pay big.",

Any American TSM fabs will be 2-3 nodes behind the bleeding edge obvoisly \n\nThose guys are literally the undisputed masters at what\u2019s probably the most technologically advanced and important industry on the planet.  \n\nYou really think those same people would be dumb enough to give away their geopolitical pocket aces for some Biden bux (a one time sun which amounts to less than half of their annual capex)?\n\nNo, tensions will escalate, w AI being all the hype for US and China needing Taiwan \u201cunification\u201d as a domestic rallying cry. Eventually US military will have officially take position to protect Taiwan.\n\nAnd then we\u2019ll all get rich lol TSM bb LFG\n\nEDIT to commenter below (I\u2019m prohibited from posting) - they *do* own the technological process.  Samsung owns theirs and Intel owns theirs as well.  And none are close to TSM.    \n\nLabor isn\u2019t cheap there it\u2019s not the 80s lol; they simply are the best.  For example Qualcomm dropped Samsung for 5nm node cuz they\u2019re quality was so shit \n\nYes they use ASML as a vendor for the EUV machine (which is just one part of the process) but ASML is already trading at 40x earnings. It\u2019s not undervalued",

(South africa and sudan are in precarious positions as well)\n\nAs well as the pending-now-current eurozone crisis 2: French boogaloo, with inflation prices skyrocketing at the same time across the eu with an average of 10-15% food inflation in some areas (spain iirc was taking the brunt of this).\n\nNow we move into the local industry in the rest of the west where the UK is essentially DOA and may actually completely collapse in our lifetimes, while at the same time the CMBS markets in the west are rattled because incompetent morons took on interest based loans to \"support business growth\" while buying properties in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nBlackstone, fidelity, ashmore group are all going to reap the consequences of their actions along with the majority of the market.\n\nAs the market collapses the US dollar will depress and this will collapse BTC, with btc collapse, tether will die, and once tether dies the rest of the crypto market goes with it.\n\nAround the middle of the \\~45% collapse of the CMBS market, the jobs market losses will catch up and the MBS market will begin to collapse as wide-spread job losses ensue and people fail to pay their bills on these hilariously overpriced homes.\n\n\\++ a bunch of other shit, I'd recommend viewing all the notes from buffet recently",

When they grade on a curve only the top x number of people pass. It doesn't matter if x + 1 made a 95, that person will not pass. They do this to make their schools look more prestigious by saying only x% of people graduate our program. A lot of time the filter class is math, a place where American students don't do as well as their Asian counterparts. These filter courses discourage a lot of otherwise capable people from pursuing Engineering and Medical degrees. I have personally known several people who have changed degrees due to these filter courses.",

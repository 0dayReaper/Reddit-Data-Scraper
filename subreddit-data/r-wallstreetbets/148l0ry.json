I would have liked a better entry but at a certain point I might as well pull the trigger! Will most likely exit before earnings or at least convert to shares beforehand. Current Position: CCL $15 calls exp. 7/14 x220 and  $15 calls exp. 6/30 x100. Stay healthy out here!",

Everyone and the \"professional analysts\" gave CCL an F rating and said interest rates would keep them broke and be the death of CCL.\n\nThe plan the CEO laid out is very obtainable and should be back to full profit/recovery by 2024.\n\n  All these \"professional analysts\" were saying not to touch CCL with a 50' pole.  Now apparently they have changed their tune.  They bought in once they had it run down to $7/8 a share, now they change their tune to fit their agenda.   Remember BUY WHEN PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL!",

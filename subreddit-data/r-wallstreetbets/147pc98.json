I remember close to $5 a gallon in my hometown for gas in rural MD and people were PISSED. now it hovers around 3.50 a gallon. \n\nThe oil cartels push it just enough to make peak profits while not threatening revolt. Joke being that NA has tons of oil reserves, but we have moved to a \"give me what I want, but not in my backyard.\" Mentality. So digging for oil in foreign lands is 100% okay, but here in the USA it's considered environmentally damning.",

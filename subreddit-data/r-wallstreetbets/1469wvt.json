Valuations in the housing market, and accurate land ownership information in some countries, are examples. \n\n2: If you live in a country that likes to print bills to cover expenses (like Venezuela or Zimbabwe), bitcoin is totally worth it. A better option would be a digital Euro though, one that is accessible from any place in the world. It would help a lot of people. \n\nSo I think that once the dust settles there will be more room for actually useful stuff.",

It wont be a terminator skynet situation but it will be very scary in the future when most jobs in america will be overrun by AI. Im just imagining the great migration of educated and uneducated people moving to other countries for work. \n\nAlso our own government is so smitten by the wonders of AI that nothing will change. We have already seen how COVID digitalized everything and made everyone lazy. Now we will see how lack of regulation will make the unemployment rate skyrocket and the economy implode in on itself in the longrun as less consumers cuz no jobs.",

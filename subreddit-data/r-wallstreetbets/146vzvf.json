    "postText": "As the tittle says companies have Capital depreciation on their assets which you do lose your value on. What I don't like is how this gets added back to the cash flow statement as income which then gets put as a cash cost in cap ex. I say this because non cash expenses make an asset decrease on a balance sheet then on the cash flow statement you can see the money they spent on maintenance which is preventing the assets from falling so the non cash expense is still being subtracted. So if this is the case why add it back to the cash flow statement?",

This means that it does not represent an actual outflow of cash, but rather a decrease in the value of an asset on the balance sheet. While this may seem like a strange thing to do, it is actually fairly common practice in accounting and allows businesses to get a better picture of their true cash position.",

You are assuming everyone is using straight line vs macrs. It has nothing to do with repairs exp. Nothing. This is why you add it back to cash flow for dscr calculations. There is no cash cost in cap ex unless you are using naco. For naco you take cash transactions from the balance sheet. That means spend and pay on asset and liability side. Most lending institutes use EBITDA instead of  naco. But el reference it.",

Depreciation is added back because the company does not actually spend money on it. Depreciation is just the amortized difference of the purchase cost and expected residual value of an asset. It is purely an accounting artifact for tax purposes. Just like when you buy a car, it depreciates every year and so, if you had a balance sheet, you would show a loss for the depreciation, but you didn\u2019t actually have a cash flow because of it.",

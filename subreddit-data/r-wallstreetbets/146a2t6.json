And not an \u201cAI startup\u201d these days where a kid who followed one tutorial learns to send an input from a form to a ChatGPT api, but we had exclusive rights to a speech recognition software that was built by a top university with intention to be used by military but lost the contract, so they pivoted to consumer. It was software that could recognize who was speaking in a phone call/room based on ~10-15 seconds of voice training.  \n\nThis shit was cutting edge and we had ML experts and advisors, companies wanting to acquire us just for the rights to the AI parts, etc. but we had a shit ton of funding for a seed startup so we had our eyes on the prize, the only problem was even with perfect, absolute crisp voice training we could only do something like 85% accuracy. We tried to layer in audio transcription from one of the best companies in the world offering it, then sentiment analysis again from one of the top companies on earth on top of that. After all said and done, at any given point in a full conversation, either sentiment was wrong, text was wrong, or who was speaking was wrong. When you throw something that has 80% accuracy, into something that has 80% accuracy into something that has 80% accuracy, you end up with ~50% accuracy, so you may as well coin flip.  \n\nWe literally were using and paying for some of the most cutting edge NLP and AI technology on earth and it came out as fucking shit and it was costing us tens of thousands of dollars a month. The company ultimately went under ~4 years ago.  \n\nI have a friend who is starting a side project now that basically does what we were doing, and I told him all the problems we faced, and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh no dude, I use this service, this service and this service, and it costs me like $50 a month for up to 10000 hours of audio\u201d. He shows me a demo, and it\u2019s flawless, and he built it in like a week in the evenings.  \n\nThe growth of AI and its accuracy in just the last few years is absolutely mindblowing. The shit coming out right now is not even close to the stuff that existed 5 years ago.",

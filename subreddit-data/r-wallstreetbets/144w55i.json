They also brought back the economic minister that Erdogan called a thief into the cabinet in the same position. \n\nSay what you want about First Republic Bank co-CEO Hafize Gaye Erkan that left in December 31st 2021 and stunned the financial media but at least she knows when to run. She obviously knew what would happen to First Republic when the Fed signaled interest rates were going to rise. \n\nShe is there so that the the Government can say we brought in an expert all the way from America (even though we blame America for our economic problems). \n\nPersonally I hope she has more integrity in this office then she did with First Republic but I doubt it.",

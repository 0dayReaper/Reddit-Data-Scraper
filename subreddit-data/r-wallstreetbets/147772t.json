Sometimes gut feeling trades make the most for us.\nExample:  I bought 10- $24p ($520) on CVNA last Friday on a whim at 9am break.  Held them til 15 mins before close and sold them for over 1000% profit.  \nSo just toss out a prediction for the EOD or EOW that you think will go against analysis and happen.",

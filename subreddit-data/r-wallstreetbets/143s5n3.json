This is why countries in bad places always end up in inflation traps.  You print more money and it has the double effect that no one will offer credit that won't be worth anything when it's paid back so you can't get into that trouble again (but loose the benefits of credit internally) and also basically devalues all that debt.\n\nIt's a terrible nightmare, but it's better than your whole country having so much debt that you spend all your time and money struggling to pay someone else basically forever like actual US citizens are right now.\n\nDebt is a great tool if used wisely and an idiot trap if used poorly.",

The real problem is that credit starts to dry up like in 2008 even if the core reason why is different (actually if it's b2b loan lockup instead of retail focused it gets FAR worse, far more rapidly).  Many businesses in the US float day to day operations on credit.  This drastically lowers their requirements to hold cash to cover operational cost spikes.  If you freeze this, then the economy starts to seize up. Businesses can't operate like they have and businesses that can't make their bottom line work with little to no available credit start to fail in waves.  This in turn creates dominos failures as other businesses in the ecosystem that rely on them or their workers being paid also start to fail.\n\nGenerally credit provider systemic failures completely destroy economies.  This is WHY the government bails these out.\n\nNote that all of this is stupidly simplified and in reality is extremely hard to predict what the failing entities will be or when they will fail, but at a basic level it's what happens.  Usually bears that are full of shit can be easily identified by claiming they know exactly when or how the market will go down and not just risk factors that should freak people out.",

That does not equal the 21,000.00 value it shows.\n  \nEdit: I want this to be real badly, because this will be close to a mill in the morning. Only explanation I can think of is Robinhood shows nearest rounded penny for average cost, and really his cost is a little higher than .19. I want to believe.",

It wasn't happiness so much as an adrenaline fueled spike of possibilities, what I would do with that cash and how would I leverage it into more buying and what if it went up even more and I had millions!  The idea that it would dissappear by morning had me checking my app nonstop to look at AH action and watched futures all night and I remember thinking \"this is too much\" I didn't like the feeling, I mean obviously a ton of money is always nice but trading is too much for me.  \n\nI do 5k-10k options per week now to deal with it as I love the action but man oh man your post brought me right back to January 2021.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanyways man I wish you the best and hope you can repeat the success you almost made and even more !",

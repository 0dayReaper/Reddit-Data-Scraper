    "postText": "Serious Question. What's Wrong with Using RH?\n\nI don't typically trade a ton of options, I'm usually just an equity trader. I've bounced around multiple platforms in my time, TD, Fidelity, etc but I've been using RH lately due to ease of use on my cell phone so I can track values pretty easily. Their values seem to update quickly, there doesn't seem to be a lag in option values and underlying values like on other platforms. Most of my trading is done in the morning, which is an issue in some other platforms when markets open. \n\nOther than the inability to sell short which is already very risky, what makes RH a bad investment platform? I haven't seemed to have any issues with them in terms of withdrawing money, depositing money, purchasing assets in a timely manner, etc. \n\nI've seen this question asked multiple times on this forum and the only answers people seem to provide is \"just wait you'll get screwed over\".. I'm just looking for a real answer",

            "comment": "&gt;There are a few key reasons why Robinhood is not considered to be the best investment platform. Firstly, it does not offer traditional research tools that other platforms do. This means that you will have to rely on third-party sources for your information, which can be unreliable. Secondly, Robinhood has been known to experience outages during times of high market volatility. This can lead to serious losses if you are unable to trade when you need to. Finally, there have been several instances of fraud and theft reported by Robinhood users. While this is not specific to the platform itself, it is something that potential investors should be aware of before using it",

I\u2019ve used Think or Swim but although the analytics where great it was slow.   Interactive Brokers kept having issues with showing the options pricing when I had them.",

            "comment": "RH had two major scares that made a lot of people leave the platform. One was a kid who made bad investments, woke up with -$700k in equity and committed suicide so there was speculation the company would get railroaded with fines and investigations. The second was during the memestock rush in 2020 when retail traders flooded the market acting as a Plebeian hedge fund leveraging their combined buying power against elites trying to manipulate the market with shorts. At one key moment of volatility they locked everyone out of conducting any activity with these stocks as some alleged phone calls were made by their business partners that happened to be betting against them. The pause in market activity caused retailers to lose their asses and give the big money Hedgefunds a day to recover as they were still able to make moves during the lockout. The claims of foul play couldn\u2019t be fully verified and nothing was done as Bidens new head of SEC was in the pocket of the hedgefunds at the center of the controversy. She had done multiple speaking engagements for them totaling nearly a million. The result left a bad taste in peoples mouths and many vacated the platform.",

            "comment": "Let me give you serious answer. RobinHood (RH) used to suck more in the past, but it's gotten better over the years. Here are some PROS and CONS:\n\n**PROS:**\n\n* Zero-commission and zero-fee trades (*but there's no free lunch, and RH has to make money, see the 1st CON*).\n* User friendliness and ease of use (*that's why I got into it*).\n* RobinHood now has self-clearing capabilities (*they don't rely on 3rd party clearinghouse anymore*).\n\n**CONS:**\n\n* You are the PRODUCT, and your data is harvested for RH's profit, which is used in High Frequency Trading (HFT). I'm really surprised nobody on this thread has mentioned HFT, which is very controversial--Google it if you want to learn more. But the TLDR version is that whether you realize it or not, HFT and bots are the human trader's worst enemy.\n* Inadequate charting capabilities.\n* No native Windows or Mac application, you're left with Android or the web version of RH.\n* After enough training and experience, you'll probably outgrow RH (*and that's why I'm going to transition away from it*).\n\nSo there you go. In my opinion, the worst CON is the 1st bullet point. I really don't like \"you're the product\" model, so I'll probably switch over to TastyTrade or a different platform later this year.",

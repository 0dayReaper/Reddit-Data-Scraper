            "comment": "&gt;There's no definitive answer, but generally speaking a reverse split is not good news for shareholders. It typically indicates that the company's stock price has been declining and they're trying to artificially boost it by reducing the number of shares outstanding. This can be done for a variety of reasons (e.g., to make the stock look more attractive to potential investors), but it usually doesn't bode well for the long-term prospects of the company.",

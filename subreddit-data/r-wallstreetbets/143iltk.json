The economy was collapsing so fast during the first months of Covid that it could have caused damage that could have taken 5-10 years to repair.  Remember 2008 and the housing crisis, and the 4-5 years it took to gain all those jobs back through organic job growth with slow QE that countered the deflation forces?  Ya, that was nothing compared to how fast the economy was cratering in 2020.  They errored on the side of inflation to get the job done.  Their mistake was not taking money out of the system 6-12 months earlier as the inflation started setting in.  Now, sure, you may not be happy with the recession we're in now but its nothing compared to 2020.  Sure you can armchair quarterback from today looking backwards in time but back then in that moment, you'd be crapping your pants if you had their job.  If you want to point the finger, point it at Congress who kind of did absolutly nothing but point fingers.  Point the finger at congress now.  Congress has lots of power to shape the economy, shape where they want growth, and set the country up for the future that could be better than today.  The FED RES plays with rates and printing money and it's a very blunt instrument that can only do so much.  Now, if congress actually managed things better rather than trying to score media points, and wall street was a little more responsible, maybe the Fed Res wouldn't have to do so much.  Aren't there crimes and fraud in each cycle?  Dot Com companies IPOing with lousy business models, then subprime mortgages, and this time around BS NFTs and Crapto coins....  There are people out there that are more than happy to take money from you, like the bozos at FTX...   Go after the real ciminals please.",

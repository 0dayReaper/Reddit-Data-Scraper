I tricked myself into believing it balanced out since I would have green days, but never this much. Options has honestly kinda ruined my life. I'm still happy but now these days that I'm pretty poor, if I wasn't so reckless with that 37k my life would be in a completely different place. I'm an electrical engineer and make over 100k a year but I still do reckless things like this. \n\nAnyway see you guys at 9:30 for ITM puts",

When we are making money, it is easy to convince ourselves that we can afford to take risks. However, when those risks don't pay off, it can be devastating.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing well financially overall though. That is good news! Maybe next time you will think twice before taking such big risks with your money. In the meantime, best of luck to you in all your future endeavors!",

Therefore, say you are 30. You still have 35 years of earnings. You are going to make 3.5m minimum from your job. a 37K loss now is insignificant.\n\n2) Next time do smaller plays; and stick to shares if you are going to trade. Alternatively, if you are going to do options, buy 1 year out. \n\n3)  Finally, if you are getting back immediately, go slow. Don't try and get it back all in one go. Just chip away at it. Maybe trick yourself - 1K a week for the next 37 weeks. Set small goals. I want to make 3K this month and then 3K next month. Eventually, you will notice at some point, wow, my loss is only now 15k. Always, and always preserve your capital. You can make it back if you have it.",

You are also not factoring in things like wage growth not catching up to inflation and inflation is becoming a runaway train wreck. That makes the new inflation numbers look even more dramatic. Let's take price of new vehicles for example. The prices have \"gone down\" due to discount to the MSRP sticker price by $500. Good news right? Not so fast. Sure they offered a nice discount, but have overall raised their MSRP price. So what if they offered a $500 discount after raising MSRP by $2000. Meanwhile your $15 an hour wage hasn't changed in the last two years, and if it did you're probably making $15.50 an hour now. (Numbers are just a figurative example)\n\nWhat can be observed is that companies are making less sales, but they raised their MSRP and have dramatically increased their profitability. Companies don't have any incentive to lower their prices now. That's why inflation is sticky. 3-4% inflation might become the new reality instead of the standard arbitrary 2% they insist is the goal. The FED will have to keep going at it until everyone maxed out their credit cards, something breaks, or beat the consumption out of consumers.",

    "postText": "So recently Disney has decided to scale back marketing for Indy 5 and the new Star Wars project the Acolyte. They already acknowledged that both projects are over budget and expect them to tank. Made a chunk of money a month ago on puts and now i think it looks good to repeat the process.\n\nKeep in mind they sunk over a billion dollars on their star wars hotel just to have it open for less than a year and finally put an axe to it. Now there is rumors about selling Lucasfilm back to George Lucas himself.\n\nOh yeah, almost forgot; Disney tanked Willow another Lucas property. At this rate, I wonder if Disney would be selling Lucasfilm at a loss?\n\nIts genuinely baffling why Disney has not about faced with Star wars and Lucasfilm. I know the long term whale investors are pissed off at Kathleen Kennedy. You can say what you want about woke this and that or that the pandemic changed the markets but numbers don\u2019t lie. Lucasfilm is bleeding money and in life support and yet Kathleen Kennedy keeps running the company into the ground. On top of that, they fired Chapek who was there for about 2 years and re-hired Iger who put Disney in this mess to begin with. The man is an acquisition guy and it shows. Disney is now top heavy with stuff but no real leadership or vision to manage it.  They might as well be a media monopoly and yet they are sinking like the Titanic. A monopoly shouldn\u2019t lose money at all.\n\nSo what\u2019s the play?\n\nEdit:\n\nThe rumor of the sale to Lucas comes from an apparently high bill owed to Comcast.\n\nThought i would add some more DD. Disney has had slow park attendance since the pandemic and with consumers carrying $5k in credit card debt month to month Disney is expecting a small turnout to their parks globally.\n\nGiven the extended covid restrictions in California among other economic and environmental issues, I\u2019m not sure that Disney park will ever turn around.\n\nDisney has also been hit with a class action lawsuit after modifying annual pass holders contract.\n\nMarvel is also on a death spiral. Comic books are near death with both Marvel and DC comic book sales reaching all time lows. Meanwhile, Marvel movies are barely limping along. Although the recent Guardians movie was genuinely pretty good, ticket sales were less than expected.\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to mention the losses from the little Mermaid movie. I think the little mermaid ride at the magic kingdom should have been a tip off that no one would give a shit.\n\nToy sales are non-existent, with countless marvel and star wars toys ending up on clearance or returned to the manufacturer. Let\u2019s not forget the Grogu doll fiasco; once they finally made the doll Christmas had already come and gone and no one gave a shit when they finally hit shelves.\n\nLastly, Disney Plus keeps seeing huge dips in subscribers. There does appear to be boycotting of its shows but i think the main driver is that no one can afford it since they keep raising the price tag.",

Disney at its core has a strong business with a diverse offering of services and products. Its leadership is trying to turn things around, but progress is slow and investors do not have the patience at this stage to hold and wait.",

                            "comment": "They do not owe money to Comcast.  They are in a contractual agreement to purchase the remaining shares of Hulu from Comcast so Disney will own 100% of Hulu.  Disney can pull an Elon/Twitter and just decide not to agree to the contract.  This will then result in renegotiating the price tag or an expensive court date for both companies.  Disney also can decide to sell their ownership of Hulu to reduce debt (but Iger has stated he is still planning to purchase complete ownership of Hulu).  \n\nI am a Long Share holder of Disney and see quite a bit of sideways trading for most of this year.  But end of 2023 and going into 2024 should have some catalyst and recovery to their balance sheet.\n\nThe dividend reinstatement will make the hedgefunds and older investors happy and allow for some minor upward movement.  Disney has reduced debt by cancelling the Willow series as well as others, renting off some of its material to other streaming services and closing its Star Wars hotel (too expensive for the real fans) fiasco.  They have another brand new Cruise ship setting sail in the next year or two which will attract plenty of interst as their cruise business has been running strong during the recovery.\n\nESPN is also a drag on Disney, but there is a lot of questions for how they proceed...Sell it or focus on the agreements and ownership they have in place with Draftkings DKNG to create more opportunities for income streams for both compnanies.  \n\nAlso, do not forget that Disney will be at the forfront of using AI.  They will be able to improve their Website and mulitple apps (parks, shopping, cruise, etc...) they will use it for interactions on their rides in their stores as well as their magicbands. They will develop more relationships with companies like they currently have such as Apple where they will have content for viewing with the Apple Vision and will be able to produce games for augmented reality and VR.  \n\nIt is still the TOP Global Licensor in the world.\n\nIn summary maybe a short Term short play (but i do not see the price moving much further down) Disney is more of a 2+ year play as they improve their balance sheet and figure out the correct path for future leadership after the previous Fuck up.",

I bought calls for aug and sep more so hoping for a pump on good future guidance. Disney is building a new cruise ship that i think will launch within a year, along with a new private island and they are currently finishing up a lot of projects around their theme parks across the globe. They are also adjusting the Annual Passholder disaster and I think with these new updates parks will see increase in attendance.   I will say movies and disney plus is a toss up and that could keep the stock down so we shall see.",

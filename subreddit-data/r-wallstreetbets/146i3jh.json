    "postText": "\n\nWhy the \u201crecession\u201d seems to not be happening.. in most places.\n\nBasically, it comes down to secular growth trends and money flow. Despite the fact that there are high interest rates, slowing retail spending, layoffs, high debt, low cash reserves- the sky appears to not be falling. It will however, happen in some places. \n\nRight now, there are industries, cities, and technologies that are going to suffer, but there are also ones that will do well. There are cities, for example, that are ripe for a housing crash (San Francisco, Phoenix, Nashville). There are industries and companies who, if they don\u2019t keep up with AI, won\u2019t make it. The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023. The movement and velocity of money, while slowing down in the macro sense, still hasn\u2019t broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats. \n\nAll of it has the same common thread- some areas will suffer and some areas will boom. We find these by evaluating leadership, policy, and catalysts for growth. \n\nThings can come to a grinding halt if the consumer is in such a tight spot that money stops flowing- however that is also not really happening yet, and it would seem as if the federal reserve doesn\u2019t truly want to get to that point. Political climates could change and influence this, but that probably won\u2019t happen until the next presidential election. Technically, if year over year GDP growth starts to go negative, then we are in a recession. Even still, there will be opportunities that arise out of that, like a cooled down real estate market, and maybe some stocks at discounted valuations. Right now, there are definitely stocks that have been ignored compared to the AI rally, and may be ripe for buying. \n\nTypically my basic initial checklist looks like this:\nIs this company profitable?\nIs it run well?\nDoes the leadership have a vision and good follow-through? \nDoes it have a strong cash position? \nDoes it have a competitive moat? \nAm I buying a great company at a fair price?\nWhat are the catalysts for future growth?\n\nThere are many more factors to take into account but this is a good place to start. You can modify and apply these principles to real estate as well.",

What are the catalysts for future growth?\n\nAnd after all that,\n\n&gt; The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023\n\nIt's not rocket science. Buy companies during downturns, that are nigh monopoly in their industry. I am just waiting till end of this year to put my tip right in. Sold end of May, when the hype was at an all-time frenzy.

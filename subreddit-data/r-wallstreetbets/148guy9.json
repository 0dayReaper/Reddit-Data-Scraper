You will not go bankrupt because you have shares. worst case \"baghold\" for a while, but can you really baghold SPY when it tends to go up YtY? \n\nthis does not apply to options because of the swings and open interest in close and PM, and of course options lose 100% fast.",

Of course you are going to  benefit more when the market is closed is when most of the up happens This is like saying when I drop an apple from a height it falls.",

If he didn't pause then why now. 4% is still way off 2%, and the hardest is going to be going below  the 3-3.5% mark which will cause sticky inflation.\n\nI have a strong feeling their will be another rate hike.",

What we absolutely don't know is what Powell will say during the press conference. His tendency has been to lay out warnings of future rate hikes, which then causes the market to pull back. But, no matter whether what he says has a positive or negative effect on the market, the odds of SPY increasing after the brief is released at 2pm are pretty high. After 2:30pm, OP could either make a bunch more money or lose it all, and there's no way to make an educated guess there.",

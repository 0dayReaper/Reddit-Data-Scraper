    "postText": "Key points from the news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;TSMC, the leading semiconductor foundry, is set to significantly expand its chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity by the end of 2024. According to DigiTimes, TSMC plans to increase its CoWoS capacity from 8,000 wafers per month to 11,000 wafers per month by the end of this year and aims to reach around 20,000 wafers per month by the end of 2024. However, even with this expansion, it is anticipated that Nvidia will consume approximately half of the capacity available at that time. AMD is also reportedly seeking additional CoWoS capacity for next year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The growing demand for technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC) is driving the adoption of complex multi-chiplet designs, exemplified by products like AMD's Instinct MI300 and Nvidia's H100. Nvidia, in particular, is considered the primary beneficiary of the increasing demand for AI-focused compute GPUs and currently controls over 90% of compute GPU shipments for new deployments. Consequently, TSMC is facing challenges in meeting the demand for its CoWoS advanced packaging solutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Presently, TSMC has the capacity to process approximately 8,000 CoWoS wafers per month, with Nvidia and AMD utilizing about 70% to 80% of this capacity. Following them, Broadcom represents the third-largest user, accounting for around 10% of the available CoWoS wafer processing capacity. The remaining capacity is divided among 20 other fabless chip designers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Expanding CoWoS capacity requires specialized production tools, and their lead times typically range from three to six months. Hence, TSMC's ability to rapidly increase its CoWoS capacity is constrained.",

TSMC is aiming to increase its CoWoS capacity from 8,000 wafers per month to 20,000 wafers per month by the end of 2024, but even this expanded capacity is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the needs of Nvidia and AMD.",

Nvidia appears to be the primary driver of this demand, with AMD also benefiting from the increased adoption of complex multi-chiplet designs.",

    "postText": "Some of you may have seen my [DD post on Chart Industries (GTLS) in relation to an upcoming EPA rule change limiting PFAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13m1a6f/dd_new_epa_pfas_regulations_big_money_for_chart/) contamination in water. [But as I briefly mentioned, Chart Industries also has significant potential to increase its sales in relation to potential new EPA carbon emissions regulations in the natural gas industry.](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2023/05/11/epa-takes-aim-a-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-coal-gas-powerplants-alliant-midamerican/70209486007/) Chart Industries is a major equipment supplier in the natural gas industry and has moved to significantly diversify its business lines to include water treatment and, importantly for this post, carbon capture technology. If the newly proposed EPA carbon emission regulations are adopted, carbon capture technology will be a key element in natural gas plants being able to meet the new emissions standards. Chart Industries is well poised to profit off of any such regulation change.\n\n[In 2021, Chart won a subsidies from the Department of Energy to develop carbon capture technologies](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/07/2310264/9318/en/Chart-Industries-Inc-SES-Cryogenic-Carbon-Capture-Technology-Selected-for-Funding-from-the-U-S-Department-of-Energy.html). Most carbon capture technology developed thus far has focused on \"sequestration\", which attempts to lock the carbon underground to prevent its emission into the atmosphere. [However, Chart's technology takes a different approach which is more energy efficient and actually produces a useable end product.  Natural gas power plants use a \"flue\" to disperse unwanted post-combustion gasses after the natural gas is burned to produce power. Chart's technology intercepts the \"flue gases\" before they are released into the atmosphere and liquifies them, thus creating liquid carbon-dioxide and other liquid forms of greenhouse gas.](https://www.chartindustries.com/Products/Carbon-Capture) These liquid gases can then be resold on the open market. As a result, Chart is well poised to profit off of the newly proposed EPA carbon emission regulations as virtually all natural gas power plants will be forced to implement some type of carbon capture technology in order to meet the new standards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Diagram of Chart Industries carbon capture process](https://preview.redd.it/yfq2z4zfxs4b1.png?width=1167&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5318cfc476dec8b1e0d7041fbb6f2056cbd46b8a)\n\n[While many naysayers may argue that \"renewables are the future and natural gas is the past\", they ignore that natural gas is currently the largest source of American energy at 36% of total American energy production in the United States.](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/data-and-statistics.php) This figure has been rising over the past several years, despite the push for \"green energy\". [Furthermore, there has in the past several months been a lashback by both leftwing environmental groups and conservatives against offshore wind energy, which i will expound upon in the future](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462). The totality of the circumstances shows that natural gas power is not going away anytime soon, and that Chart Industries is well situated to profit off it.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyfa45ljxs4b1.jpg?width=782&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=402cafe5a1c346ff672805244e7ebfae73afb9c7\n\nI am long both GLTS with 141 shares of GLTS and 3 June 16 $120 strike calls  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bm2wj1vixs4b1.jpg?width=970&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d4292f0efd6b3fb34a87022cb9b437c27ddabae8",

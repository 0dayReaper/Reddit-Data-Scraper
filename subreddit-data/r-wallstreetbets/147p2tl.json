FL also has a glut of inventory which doesn\u2019t look great as NKE is their primary source\u2026 \nA large chunk of wealth has gone into consumer pockets by not needing to service that loan debt the last few years. Not saying you\u2019re wrong to be bullish but I think as the year progresses retailers and fashion brands may see further weakness before any return to growth.",

Intereting stuff and all, but I mean its been every president's ultimate fantasy since Eisenhower to kick Russia'a ass (or at least have someone else take the punches for us and spank them with our belts). The space race and the importance of aerospace warfare has led to alot of the power and $ in the U.S. military was funneling to the air force, and now the space force it, alot of people think that Trump founded the Space Force bc he said he did and it sound ridiculous enough, but all he did was create a new branch under the U.S. Space Command, (they run almost all the same ops under a different name) and gave them a huge amount of money but its just a brand name change in principle and tiny power shift with the new $. I digress, but the point is the contracts and the money flows with the power and Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed Martin are at the top with their defense contracts. The NNWC (Naval Network Warfare Command) and Navy Intel used to have a huge amount of influence. And bapck when the Soviets launched Sputnik, the U.S. formed ARPA now DARPA to compete and their more modern ops crossover into alot of other military programs. Boeing has already taken over ops run by DARPA and the NNWC and used them for their own plays before. The U.S. has already declassified airplane performance of our own projects that many would consider physics defying. All 3 co's should be investigated for crimes especially Boeing and Lockheed but anyway, it's gotta be a buy for a long term growth for sure, the trajectory its on rn. Theyre never really priced in unless theres a market crash",

How will we ever really know when we got it or where it came from, the U.S. aliens, freakin germans who tf knows? If we're really gonna find anything of substance about it, its decades old news.",

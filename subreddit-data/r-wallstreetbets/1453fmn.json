The ER on SPY isn't awful, but if you're going to buy and hold VOO (Vangard's sp500 ETF) is better. The advantage of SPY is that it has more liquidity which makes it better for trading because the bid ask spread is smaller. So SPY for short term trading, VOO for buy and hold.\n\nAlso I'd suggest VTI as an alternative. It's Vangard's Total Market index ETF. It's mostly the same since the sp500 is so much of the market anyways, but it also includes the rest of the market.",

Helps explain why money does not buy happiness\n  - Expecting both good and bad events is often more intense than experiencing them\n-\tGreed\n  - There is only one sure thing on Wall Street. And this is there are NO sure things\n  - Lightning seldom strikes twice\n  - Lock up your &amp;quot;Mad Money&amp;quot; and throw away the key. If you can&amp;#39;t stop yourself from gambling in the market, then limit the amount\n  - Control your cues. Turn off CNBC\n  - Think twice before making any decisions. Calm yourself down\n-\tPrediction\n  - Our incorrigible search for patterns leads us to assume that order exists where there is non\n  - Whenever you are confronted with anything random, you WILL search for patterns in it\n  - People hate randomness\n  - If a reward is big enough, it will carry a long-lasting memory that is difficult to break. This is why chart analysts get into trouble because they think they &amp;quot;got it&amp;quot;\n  - Investors have a recency bias \u2013 what has happened they think will continue to happen, even if it is unpredictable. This causes investors to think that a bull market will continue and a bear market will also. This also causes them to buy the hottest mutual funds\n  - Control what you can in the market \u2013 don&amp;#39;t look for the next Google\n    - Expectations \u2013 set realistic goals\n    - Risk \u2013 ask not how much you can gain, but also how much you can lose\n    - Readiness \u2013 think twice\n    - Expenses \u2013 keep them low\n    - Commissions \u2013 keep them low too\n    - Taxes \u2013 don&amp;#39;t day trade, you get hit with short term taxes\n    - Yourself \u2013 don&amp;#39;t try to predict\n  - Don&amp;#39;t try to predict the market \u2013 DCA is a good strategy to prevent this\n  - Most mutual fund managers fail to beat the market. Answer to this is to DCA into index mutual funds\n  - Correlation is not causation\n  - Take a break \u2013 if you take a break, it resets your &amp;quot;gamblers fallacy&amp;quot; IE \u2013 a coin is flipped 7 times and comes up heads 7 times in a row, the next flip is &amp;quot;due&amp;quot; for a tail.\n  - Don&amp;#39;t obsess \u2013 if owning stocks is a long-term project for you, then following changes constantly is a very, very bad idea.\n-\tConfidence\n  - Create a &amp;quot;too hard&amp;quot; pile. Know what you don&amp;#39;t know.\n  - Measure 2x cut 1x. Have an overconfidence discount of 25% so if a stock according to your valuation is worth between $40-60. Make it $30-45.\n  - Don&amp;#39;t get stuck on your own companies&amp;#39; stock\n  - Diversification is the best defense\n-\tRisk\n  - Take a time out. Do not buy or sell an investment on the spur of the moment\n  - When the price drops, so does risk.\n  - Try to prove yourself wrong. Listen to another person&amp;#39;s opinion\n  - Know yourself and your risk tolerance\n-\tSurprise\n  - If everyone knows something. It is already embedded in the price of the stock\n  - High hopes can cause big trouble\n-\tRegret\n  - Expecting regret often hurts worse than experiencing it\n  - The more you can automate your investing, the better\n  - Face your loss.\n  - If you have a truly diversified portfolio, then you will guarantee yourself, by definition, that some of your assets will do well while some will do badly. You have to look at the whole portfolio\n  - Don&amp;#39;t chase hot sectors or stocks. The cure for chasing is to rebalance. Decide on a number and stick with it\n  - Rebalancing over the long-term increases returns and lowers risks. It is buying low and selling high\n-\tHappiness\n  - If you earn enough cash to live on. Then more money won&amp;#39;t make you happier\n  - Know that money is a means, not an end in itself\n-\tSummary\n  - Take a global view. Look at total net worth, not changes in each holding\n  - Hope for the best but expect the worst. Diversifying can keep you from panicking during bad times which will occur\n  - Investigate before you invest. A stock isn&amp;#39;t just a price. It is a company\n  - Never say always. Never put more than 10% of your investments into a single stock\n  - Know what you don&amp;#39;t know.\n  - The past is not the prologue. What goes up must come down and what goes way up usually comes down with a crunch. Never buy an investment because it is going up. Smart investors buy low and sell high\n  - If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Anyone who offers a high return at low risk is probably a fraud\n  - Costs are killers. Trading costs eat up your profits\n  - Don&amp;#39;t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread out between US, foreign, bonds, and cash. It is not a good idea to invest heavily in industries that your job is tied too. If you lose your job, your stock would be likely to fall also.\n\nI also have lots more under my profile if you want to read other stuff",

Presumably because they want to get more adds in front of eyeballs before their IPO so they can trick the only mildy regarded investors into thinking this site has worth. But rather than telling the 3rd party apps to pound sand directly they jerked them around for a few months before finally announcing that API access will be available for the fuck off price starting in a month.\n\nI guess how highly regarded /u/spez actually is will be determined by how much money he makes from the Reddit IPO. A lot of people are predicting it'll make this place even more shit. But then this place was already shit.",

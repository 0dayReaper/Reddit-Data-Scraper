As the value of a stock rises closer to any given strike price, the value of the underlying contract of the option increases as well, because it is (mathematically) becoming more and more favorable of successfully going \"into the money\".\n\nIn this case I think the value of the contracts would actually be closer to 60 or 70, I admit that I don't put much thought into how much I'm trying to profit specifically, only that the strategy is sound.  \n\n\nEdit: This is also predicated on the value increasing at a decent pace ahead of the natural weekly depreciation as weeks pass approaching expiration.",

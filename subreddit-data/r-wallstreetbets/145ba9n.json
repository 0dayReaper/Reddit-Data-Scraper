    "postText": "A large concern in the UPS / TEAMSTERS negotiation is the heat level in the cargo area of the package cars or brown trucks. Teamsters want Air Conditioning installed. \n\nIf the company agrees to retrofit existing vehicles that could be a boon to companies which build AC hardware for the delivery vehicles. It might just bolt on, the powertrains for the vehicles is likely the same ones vendors sell to corps who DO want factory AC. \n\nWhat companies do you think stand to gain? \nDo you think it would be a whole fleet retrofit or merely an agreement to purchase AC on new vehicles? (would take literally 20 years to completely roll over). \n\nI don't know if they would contract out the installation to a third party or do it in house either. Any ideas who would gain if outsourced?\n\nFurther, since the cargo area is the main concern I wonder if it would be a non standard setup, like the Prius' solar powered AC system",

            "comment": "This is just me speaking off the cuff............\n\nHeavy equipment mechanic and own my own company.  I have a buddy who owns a truck repair company who contracts with Fedex, Ryder, and Enterprise (they have rental trucks).\n\nUPS and Fedex have in house mechanics........but they take care of the simple stuff.  Wiper replacement, lightbulbs, some oil changes, etc.  Big stuff like injector replacement, transmission work, etc goes out to people who are equipped for that.  So the AC stuff is going to an outside vendor.\n\nNOW.........you need to prototype and develop a system to go into those hot boxes they call trucks.  Are we putting AC into the whole cargo area and driver compartment??  Or just the driver compartment??  Lotta sq ftge in the cargo area...........means more BTU's to cool it.\n\nYour restricted by the area in front of the radiator where the condenser will go (the condenser strips the heat from the refrigerant).  More BTU's the bigger the condenser needs to be, and you'll need more refrigerant.  \n\nDoes the engine compartment have room for the compressor??  Need to make a space for that somewhere.  All of the new engines have serpentine belts so you'll need to mount it somewhere where the serpentine belt will work or be able to add another pulley and belt.\n\nNext we get into the refrigerant.............up until a few years ago all heavy equipment and trucks used R134 as a refrigerant.  That is being phased out.  All passenger cars and light trucks now used 1234xy as a refrigerant.  That uses propane or butane for cooling.  It's classed as a semi flammable.  They will probably go with 1234xy since 134 is being phased out........but its 2-3 x as expensive as R134 (go figure on that one).\n\nOnce you get a working prototype and size it the BTU's needed.........your off and running.  Cookie cutter installs...........but it's time consuming.\n\nAlso, look at a company called RED DOT.  They make AC kits for install on trucks and farm equipment that don't have existing AC in the cabs.  They might be a contender to make these kits.  Also, as an aside; alot of fire trucks don't have AC in them.........or when they get made new today, the AC is almost an after thought and the systems they put in them don't do jack squat for cooling.\n\nJust my thoughts on the fly........",

Some of the new ones are Workhorse but it's only a handful.\n\nThe teamsters sound sick of the work harder and sweat to get paid more aspect, and now would rather just work harder and stay cool...

I don't know how much weight the contract negotiation is putting on it.\n\nYeah Sean O'Brien is definitely an intimidating person I found his exchange with that douchebag Congressman particularly entertaining.\n\nBut I also don't think he's a dummy I think he is going to try to avoid the strike",

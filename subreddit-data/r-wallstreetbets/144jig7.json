The breakeven price quoted is for the calls he previously bought ... so buying it now at $3.15 gives you a breakeven price of $433.15.  Strike one for the bot.  Second, 1.05 times 409.19 gives you 429.65, which is well below either of those breakeven prices.  So the OP's calls would expire worthless with a 5% increase.  Strike two.",

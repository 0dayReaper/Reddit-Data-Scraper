Ford, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Kia, etc, etc. I was looking at their new cars, just checking things out. I couldn't believe my eyes.\n\nSo many truly mediocre cars that were selling for 50k, 55k, 60k. It's absolutely laughable. I'm talking about a run of the mill hatchback going for 55k. True madness.\n\nWalking around looking at that, made me think that I'll never own a new car ever again.\n\n(Probably not a true statement, but I tell myself it anyways to prepare just in case)",

In the U.S.A., car loans (securitized) exceeded $1.43 trillion in Q1 2023 (source: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MVLOAS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MVLOAS))\n\nIn recent years, car companies focused on building higher priced cars and trucks instead of the budget friendly small cars to expand profit margins. The supply chain breakdown from COVID-19 lockdowns also increased prices, but the supply chain is normalizing for most automakers. At this point, the automakers are trying to make as much money as possible before the car market implodes from a serious economic crash. With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, car buyers will have a tougher time getting new loans for these overpriced plastic cars.",

In fact not having a car at all is usually a pretty good idea if you live where that's possible.  They burn fuel, they have to be insured, you may have to pay for parking, and they depreciate.  Walking is free, biking is cheap.  With a lot of passengers a car trip may be cheaper than transit, but usually not.\n\nAssuming you buy a car, taking a car loan is a good move unless you have terrible credit.\n\nA car loan is a low interest loan because of the collateral.  Again, unless you have bad credit.\n\nMy car is paid off but the interest rate was something like 2%.  I could have paid cash but that would have been earning 2% on my money, why do that when I can do better?\n\nIt's a way to get a low interest loan that you can use to try to make a higher return.",

Lexus succeeded as a brand because Toyota made a better product than the competition at a significantly lower price, and now they're successful without having to undercut their competitors. The issue with Lucid IMO is they're entering a space where people don't trust the product to begin with (EVs). People are afraid of stuff like battery degradation and battery fires (as overblown as those issues may be) and so customers want stability from the company that will have to support their vehicle.\n\nI've helped a significant number of friends and family shop for new (or used) vehicles, and every time I mention one of these new companies like Lucid, Rivian, Polestar (yes I know they're basically Volvo but a lot of people don't), for some even Tesla, I hear back: \"yeah but what if they don't exist in 5 years? I'll be left with a worthless brick for a car\"\n\nWhen the competition won't drop their prices, as many companies have refused to do, competing on price is a valid and effective strategy, and one that Lucid may have done well to try. Right now they have the Air, a halo car that generates a lot of buzz for the brand, but until they've got something regular people can buy that's all it is, buzz.",

    "postText": "I was wondering if it is an smart idea to move from a cash account to an margin account. Im currently using IBKR (im European) and would like to know is what the pros and cons are and if you have any examples of responsible margin-trading (if there are even any responsible traders on WSB).\n\nJust want to grow steadily and not being liquidated by IBKR due to irresponsible gambling. \n\nBesides that, what happend if for example the market opens -10%, and your cash/margin cant make up for the loss? Will IBKR go after you to get their money? Thats something which bothers me since i cant find an answer on this question online.\n\nThanks for reading my fellow regards and hope to hear from you",

Also by them changing margin rates on the fly.   They have called my margins even when im in surplus the day before a big jump\u2026.   Its rigged they have full control and they want to make money off of you not vice versa.   My advice is steer clear.   Only way to use margins effectively is to scalp off day trades u are certain on, even if u are wrong just sell eod and take the loss never hold or they will find a way to fuck you.  I finally got my account value back up after a 60k loss and im probably just going to turn margins off.",

            "comment": "&gt;There are a few things to consider when deciding whether or not to move from a cash account to a margin account. The main thing is that with a margin account, you will be able to trade on leverage, which can help you increase your profits (or losses) more quickly. However, it is important to remember that with greater potential for gain comes greater potential for loss, so you need to be careful and responsible when using leverage. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that some brokers may require you have a certain amount of money in your account before they will allow you to open a margin account. So depending on your broker's requirements, moving from cash might not even be an option. \n\nAs far as what happens if the market opens -10% and your cash/margin can't make up for the loss... generally speaking, most brokers will give you time (usually 2-3 days)to bring your account back above the minimum required balance before they start liquidating positions. However, if the market continues dropping and/or there is no way for you t obring your balance back up within that time frame then yes, they will begin liquidating positions in order totry and recoup their losses .",

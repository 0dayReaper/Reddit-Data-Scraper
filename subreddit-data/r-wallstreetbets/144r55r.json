    "postText": "The latest news that GM has now followed suit with Ford to begin using Tesla\u2019s North America charging plug standard can\u2019t be good news for rivals ChargePoint and Blink \u2014 no matter how you spin it.  I can\u2019t imagine the billions of subsidies earmarked for a new EV infrastructure is going to be spent on the current CSS standard that is not going to be used by the 3 largest EV manufactures, who make up 70% of the EV market.  Even with the option of plug adapters to support the CSS (combined charging system), I would not be surprised to see an about face by the a White House to consolidate the industry to Tesla\u2019s North American standard.  This agreement between the \u201cbig 3\u201d all but guarantees the writing is on the wall.",

NACS puts that clip on on the car so if it breaks your not charging but everyone else can.\nBut your also right. Reliability is their biggest issue now besides which standard they use, but if they fix that and adopt NACS then they can survive and people can stop acting like the Tesla will have a Monopoly (which isn't necessarily a bad thing unless they abuse it).",

The fact that the three largest EV manufacturers are all using the same standard means that there is little incentive for other companies to continue supporting the CSS standard. Even with adapters, it is likely that many people will switch to Tesla's more widely used system. This could lead to a consolidation of the industry around Tesla's North American standard, which would be bad news for ChargePoint and Blink.",

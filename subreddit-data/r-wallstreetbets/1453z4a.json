    "postText": "Mornin' - [Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13k1mm4/morning_briefing_may_17th_2023/). The stock market has been relatively quiet this week, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all trading within a narrow range. This comes after the debt ceiling was raised and no major economic data was released this week. Former President Donald Trump has been indicted on seven federal criminal counts related to classified documents he kept at his Mar-a-Lago home. He will appear in court on Tuesday. This is the second criminal indictment for Trump, who has maintained his innocence in both cases. General Motors has partnered with Tesla to allow GM owners to use Tesla's Supercharger network. This is similar to a partnership that Tesla recently struck with Ford. The partnerships are a step towards a unified charging standard for electric vehicles in the United States. The American consumer is still spending, which has helped to offset some of the economic headwinds. However, there are still concerns about a recession. JPMorgan's global market strategist, Marko Kolanovic, believes that the U.S. and global economies are still on solid ground and that fears of a recession are overblown.\n\nI don't post these types of briefings daily, but I could? If you guys want more posts like this on the daily, be sure to upvote and follow me. It helps me gauge interest.\n\n**Watchlist**\n\n**M**U - Micron came down to test support around $64 and jumped off this level yesterday. This $64 level acted as significant resistance over the past year and now should act as support for the stock.\n\n**VET** - This nat gas stock is coming up to test resistance around $12.20 which is where shares topped out in May. The $12.20 resistance level coincides with the stock 50 daily MA which should provide additional resistance.\n\n**BA** - Boeing is coming up to test resistance around $219 which is where shares had topped out in February and April. The stock is also nearly overbought according to RSI which should help push shares lower.\n\n**BIDU** - Double inside bar setup on the daily time frame. A break below 133.10, I'd look for 132.53 as the first target, next targets I'd have is 132, 131, 130.52, and under 130.25.",

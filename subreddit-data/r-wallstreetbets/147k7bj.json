The assertion is that at least $1.5T of the $3T in net worth gain is allocated to the 66 wealthiest Americans.\n\n$1.5T/66 = $22.7B average increase YTD. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_Americans_by_net_worth\n\nThe top 15 wealthiest Americans on the list are large shareholders in: TSLA (+129% YTD), AMZN (+46% YTD), MSFT (+37% YTD), GOOG (+37% YTD), META (115% YTD), ORCL (+39% YTD), DELL (+15% YTD), BRK.A (+8% YTD), and WMT (+7% YTD). Phil Knight, at #15 on the list, is the only large shareholder of a company (NKE) that is down YTD.\n\nHeck, Elon alone composes about $100B of the share, so really it is about $1.4T/65. \n\nThe original comment might be a bit hyperbolic, but it is not totally divorced from reality like you think.",

S&amp;P 500 has risen more in Q2 than it did in Q1.\n\nSince I can't find net worth numbers for the end of Q1 let's just look at net worth at the [start of the year](https://ceoworld.biz/2023/01/03/wealthiest-people-in-the-united-states-january-3-2023/) vs. [now](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#3a7f3d6f3d78):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hq4oax0tpm5b1.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=03613a98634cdcf2db81e43fa0a7be72cffcbf78\n\nNow let's make an assumption that the remaining 46 billionaires have the same average change as the last 10 (which is a very generous assumption since they'd likely have less). That gives us a total change in wealth of .4 trillion. Now adjust it for the majority of stock market gains occurring in Q2 instead of Q1. And you likely have a gain of under **.2 trillion.**\n\n.2 / 3 trillion gives us 6.67% of wealth gain vs &gt; 50%\n\nI'd argue that's totally divorced from reality",

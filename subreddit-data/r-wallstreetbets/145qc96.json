Youtube never became profitable despite accounting for one third of all internet traffic. Since Alphabet bought it, they might have done something but on its own it was just hemorrhaging money.\n\nThe problem is that since the inception of the internet, people have been used to getting all these services for free. You can always find investors to fund the next free site, to grab market share, so none of these older, established companies dare to switch to a paid subscription model. \n\nAll the while governments are actively increasing the cost of maintaining a site like these. They need policing, content control, which costs a fortune. \n\nSo yes, common sense should dictate that at least the 10 largest sites should generate profits, but this has only been a promise for decades.",

Okay I\u2019ll use Alien Blue. \n\nWebsite sucks? Don\u2019t worry there\u2019s Reddit Enhancement Suite. \n\nModerator tools are lacking? There\u2019s mod toolbox \n\nAlien Blue is gone but the official app is hot garbage? Apollo is was better than Alien Blue ever was so no biggie \n\nReddit changed their website and is trying to force users to use the new design? There\u2019s old.Reddit to get around that. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not even going to count all the useful bots that are *required* for a decent user experience. \n\nThe history of Reddit is the history of being incapable of providing a completed software that your users want to use without 3rd party help. They have missed the mark since the very beginning. They have no idea what users actually want because they\u2019ve relied on 3rd parties for so long to make their website/app appealing.",

I routinely forget there even is a site that *isn\u2019t* old.reddit.com or the Apollo app. Every time I accidentally end up in the new website I want to claw my eyes out. It\u2019s absolute hot garbage. It runs like shit no matter your hardware, it\u2019s absolutely crammed full of ads and intrusive spam \u201cnotifications\u201d, and the information density is a tenth that of the old website. It\u2019s literally worse at every single thing it wants to do, and most of the features not available on old Reddit are things *literally no one asked for*, but are now suddenly forced on everyone whether they like it or not. \n\nReddit was never \u201cfriends-driven\u201d, it was never about people following people, but Reddit thought we wanted user profiles you could subscribe to and befriend (that I\u2019ve never seen anyone ever actually use). Reddit was never about your identity, most accounts were literally throwaways (which was encouraged), but they thought we wanted avatars and NFT bullshit. Reddit was always about its users making their own content and their own spaces for conversation, but now suddenly Reddit think it owns all of it and can charge exorbitant sums for anyone else to access it?\n\nNo one is too big to fail. Reddit supplanted Digg, and something else, something more free and less controlled, will supplant Reddit. I\u2019ve literally never heard so many people talk about Lemmy as I have these past few days, an analogous network of links and discussions that is genuinely independent, and it heavily echoes what went down over 14 years ago, when I suddenly started hearing everyone talk about this other platform I\u2019d also never known about before: *Reddit*\u2026",

They sure don't want anonymous accounts that are hard to market to as opposed to Facebook/YT/Instagram style accounts where they can force targeted ads on you 24/7 and sell your data for big bucks. I think it's pretty apparent that data from anonymous users with no sense of age or demographic is pretty useless which means reddit has to settle for bottom of the barrel low return spam ads or find a way to force users to establish unique verified accounts that give away key marketing cues about their identity. They're obviously going to do whatever they can to force all users down that rabbit hole since the status quo is seen as unprofitable (though they seem to be doing nothing to roll out features to keep users hooked despite all the changes).",

Every major revamp of Reddit has failed to address user interest and resulted in the third-party development of solutions. I don't know how Reddit expects to survive this one, but my, and many other decade plus accounts, will be deleted on or before June 30th in protest. It's been a good ride, but to everything a season.",

You can already see how reddit is aggressively becoming profit driven for potential shareholders by insanely increasing API price. It\u2019ll kill the platform and potentially bankrupt the company but hey another long term short for hedge funds. Maybe we can capitalize off the short interest volatility in the future cus u/spez obviously doesn\u2019t understand why twitter went private",

            "comment": "Imo Reddit is really profitable in an advertising sense. A lot of people go to Reddit and stumble upon it by just using google. \n\nThe Reddit ads representative I spoke to seemed very enthusiastic about how Reddit is starting to always show up for queries instead of some dinky SEO health line article. \n\nWith that being said, the profitability for them lies in how advertisers can HAMMER specific niches. A problem with marketing suites like google, meta, Snapchat, etc, is that when you set your targeting up, a lot of impressions you get could just be blanks and wasted money. \n\nReddit solves this problem. It\u2019s like an advertisers dream. For example, you can legitimately advertise CBD to people on marijuana specific subreddits and ONLY marijuana specific subreddits. Or ai shit to aspiring entrepreneurs. Or trading platforms to people on r/wallstreetbets. This is even before they set up email matching with customer lists, user comment history, or other analytical data you/Reddit have. \n\nKeep in mind it\u2019s different than just targeting interests, because people on certain subreddits are there for a certain reason. Someone is interested in CBD, scrolling through the CBD subreddit, boom here\u2019s a CBD Ad. For reference, google only charges cost per click because the ad lands when someone googles something related. \n\nI don\u2019t recall the exact number but google &amp; meta make a large portion of their money because of advertising. Third Party apps don\u2019t show ads, and that is the problem.",

They simply do not give you very much food for the money. How this escapes their supposedly value-conscious patrons has always befuddled me. Wendy\u2019s tastes a million times better and is also cheaper. Basically, if you\u2019re not missing half a brain, you choose Wendy\u2019s over McDonalds, at least when given a choice.",

That\u2019s because they are made of pink slime, not beef. Wendy\u2019s burgers look and taste like beef, and decent beef at that, especially for the price. $5 gets you a double stack burger, 4 chicken nuggets, fries, and a beverage. No way is McD\u2019s giving out that much food for $5, not that it would even matter seeing as I wouldn\u2019t eat their food even if you paid me to.",

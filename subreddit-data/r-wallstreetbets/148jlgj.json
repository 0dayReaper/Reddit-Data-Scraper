But it looks like we won't be touching $8 anytime soon.  Especially if the earnings report next week is as positive as I think it will be.\n\nA moment like this, some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this\nSome people search forever for that one special kiss\nOh, I can't believe it's happening to me\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment like this.\n\nFeel like Kelly Clarkson singing on American Idol.",

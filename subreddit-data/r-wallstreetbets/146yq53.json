There's a BP engineer who's a daily user and devotee of Palantir's Foundry platform posted an interesting screenshot. He's genuinely blown away by what the software can do. In his eyes, it's reshaping the business landscape, much like iOS did for smartphones.  \n\nEven in this rocky economy, Foundry is showing its mettle. It's pushing Palantir's U.S. commercial business to impressive heights, hitting a cool $1 billion annual run rate in just six years. That's some Amazon Web Services (AWS) level growth right there.\n\nThe engineer is betting on Foundry to shake things up, and take data and process handling to the next level. More efficiency, more innovation - that's the direction he sees this going.\n\nIn his business unit alone, BP is already running 36 applications on Foundry, and that's just the beginning. With new software like AIP on the horizon, he's expecting some solid gains for both BP and Palantir. Exciting times ahead, folks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbca433gs15b1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9a351417b5aee4e749cda304430a06310f6e081b",

If anything, they failed and their low stock price reflects that. \n\nBP may have been gutted to the bone. It like Intel, living of legacy, missing the future",

Gamblers would. \n\nLike somehow attaching &lt;insert company name&gt; \u201cengineer\u201d makes anyone better or more qualified at predicting stocks. \n\nGamblers hear nice sounding buzz words and use that as an excuse to rationalize desperate wishful thinking.\n\nSame type of people who spend decades wasting money buying lottery tickets using family birthdays, instead of spending that money on their actual family. For some people, hoping against all odds with a gamble is more comfortable than having to exercise years of patience and diligence. \n\nDesperation sucks, but I think it\u2019s also important to kindly recognize that we all go through it in one form or another.",

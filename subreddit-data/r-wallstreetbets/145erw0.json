If your x-axis goes from the 1960s and your y-axis is the full 100% then you can't get any click-bait at all.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1blbo3twt15b1.png?width=509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d8689cf3c0041725e2711e4b00d9404ae8351097",

I bet their context is the recent events, but i'm not in their head.\n\nPersonally i think the most relevant is see what is going to happen from now on, in the context of a changing world that i doubt will be anything like the past, Russia and China are completely gone, other countries also want to change this. The abuse of the sanctions and using the dollar as a weapon was probably abused a bit to much. We'll see. The past is history.",

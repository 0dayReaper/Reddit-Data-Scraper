Every bank has twenty different groups with potentially completely different opinions/views producing commentary, research, etc. Did GS commodity traders say it? Or the CEO? Or one of a hundred macro analysts? Or a someone on one of the dozen sales desks?\n\n\n\n\n\nI shouldn't even have to say but it's WSB so I guess I do: When GS says \u201coil is going to 250\u201d it's just a price target based on research one of their teams has conducted. If you disagree with the price target, then it's pretty easy to dig through their research (if you have access) and point out what you think is wrong with it. My point in bringing this up is that nobody focuses or cares about the price target. Every bank has price targets for everything because clients like to have a number that represents a group's opinion. But what actually matters is the research. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut feel free to link where GS said \u201coil is going to 250\u201d as well as evidence that it initiated a crash. I'll indulge your nonsense.",

I replied to another guys comment, who said anyone from GS could come out with that $200 forecast.

They care what an individual analyst or team thinks. Many will only deal with specific analysts/teams and won't trade with a bank if those people aren't available. If a bank just gave analysts \"the bank's\" talking points then there would be no point. Nobody would do business with them.            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour opinion makes me think you're not familiar with the world of finance because every single bank is similar in this regard.",

So SPY still has room to run in my opinion. Don\u2019t matter if it runs past $450 to let\u2019s say $500. It\u2019s ridiculous, I know.\n\nEither way, a pull back always comes after a run. SPY consolidating to break 52 week high. After that, nobody knows the top. Don\u2019t ever try to time the top. Just move with market sentiment",

The fact that they keep increasing their targets just goes to show how strong the market is right now, despite all of the challenges we've faced this year. Keep your eyes on Goldman Sachs' predictions for where the market is headed - they usually have a pretty good handle on things!",

Analysts constantly run their projections with the trend because that statistically works most of the time, even on pullbacks to the 0.50 Fibonacci line, which is the reason these projections tend to reverse at the bottom and get the directionality wrong. That's the max-fear state, and a signal of a reversal. \n\nWhat this chart is missing is the long line of Green forward projection revisions prior to the first one on the chart. Not saying any future possible continuing bull pattern here will happen or be like 2020/2021 (I have serious doubts about such a thing) but rather that if we're just reading this chart, all we're seeing is fear/greed and its effect on momentum expectations.",

Many times are wrong doesn\u2019t matter just know that you gotta manage risk you know don\u2019t trade because you\u2019re bored and don\u2019t get trapped. Market is way overextended and do for a pretty big pullback. Market makers are going to sell into that pool vac and by back into the retracement timing. It is not easy never is. this week coming up is gonna have crazy volatility I put some calls on the Vicks and some puts on the spy and you probably have a pretty good week.\ud83d\udc3b\ud83e\ude78\ud83e\ude78\ud83e\ude78",

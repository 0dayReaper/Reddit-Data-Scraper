Many believe these changes are being implemented due to Reddit's IPO speculated for later this year. Do you think that it may be doing more harm than good in terms of the IPO? \n\nAlso wondering if the conditions are right, depending on how this plays out, and if this topic is still relevant during the IPO launch if we could see a rally of short sellers- would expect nothing less on this subreddit.",

It is possible that it could hurt the IPO, as many users are upset about the changes and may not want to invest in a company that is making them. However, it is also possible that investors will see Reddit as a more attractive investment because of its increased user engagement due to the changes. Only time will tell how this plays out.",

I think the primary aim of the price change is to jack up the price for training AI on reddit's data. Reddit is a huge resource for AI, where else on the internet will you find real people writing full essays in the comments and the data also has a lot of organization already. Other social media platforms just contain useless noise, whenever you have a real problem you need the answer to it is common to add reddit to the end of your search to finally get a clear answer. Nvidia has  skyrocketed in the past year because they build the hardware AI trains and runs on, reddit can also see growth by realizing their position as key data AI is trained on.",

However, in general, a good win/loss ratio to aim for is around 2:1 - that is, for every two winning trades you make, you should expect to have one losing trade. Of course, it is also important to keep your losses small relative to your wins (i.e., don't let a few big losses offset all of your gains), so that even if your overall win/loss ratio isn't perfect, you can still come out ahead in the end.",

It got hammered recently by downgrades from morons behind desks who have never been out of the city and certain they never shopped in a DG store.  Upon research, they are still making money hand over fist and seem poised to continue.  My thinking is, consider this a dip and buying opportunity.  What say you?",

In the few times I stepped in one the entire inventory relies on sh*t that didn\u2019t sell at full price but unlike people buying at TJMaxx and blissfully ignoring the products are designed to be there, DG sells whatever they can get their hands on with basic commodities- the main reason people go there. However, their prices aren\u2019t substantially cheaper to justify the trip versus just going to Walmart or Target, or your local supermarket.\n\nYou go to DG when you\u2019re so poor that you basically are okay with a few cents per item savings to pick whatever they have, and you\u2019re okay with eating food that was not able to sell at the supermarkets but because it\u2019s canned you take a chance on it.",

I certainly did myself mostly because it was always a bit too expensive for my taste but now is a great deal. There's always the chance that it backfires and that it's a deep rooted problem but the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83e\udd21 s also hated on meta at $100. Stocks that are cheap never look good because all the news are bad. If all the news are good we would be at an ATH. If people here say it's the worst but the company is profitable it's usually a great indicator to buy.",

Alphabet's price-to-sales ratio is 5.6, Apple's is 7.5 and Microsoft's is 11.7.\n\nNvidia's: 37.8.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many personal reasons I think it\u2019s grossly overvalued. I wanna hear what people who think opposite have to say as well though.",

This is with dividends reinvested.\n\nIt\u2019s far more common for stocks to simply languish than to go bankrupt. NVDA could be around 20 years from now, still in business, making a great product and have 0 stock return over the entire period.\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2000&amp;firstMonth=4&amp;endYear=2023&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;leverageType=0&amp;leverageRatio=0.0&amp;debtAmount=0&amp;debtInterest=0.0&amp;maintenanceMargin=25.0&amp;leveragedBenchmark=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=true&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=CSCO&amp;allocation1_1=100",

My guess is they were conservative and have a way to hit or exceed that number. They also have great margins unlike AMZN (except for AWS). Assume AI has the real potential to add revenue or reduce costs or both for companies.  You honestly think companies won't throw money at the market leader with no real competitor when a $1 in spend may result in $5 out and differentiate them from competitors and help them gain/win market share? NVDA is selling the infrastructure for AI to other companies.\n\nThis is nothing like the dot com bubble where companies seldom had real products and were not making substantial revenue, let alone profit like NVDA.  Go back and do some reading on the dot companies bubble.  Now, do some research on AI specifically on NVDA to see how far ahead they are.  They literally have a SaaS offering for AI that companies can SUBSCRIBE to without a large capital outlay, so the barrier to entry for THEIR customer is almost non-existent.\n\nAll this being said buy NVDA on Dips.  It briefly hit low $380s this week.  If it drops back to $350 or lower I am loading up. This is a long-term hold for me.",

I\u2019m in software and it seems to me that tossing the relevant data for the use case into a vector db and throwing a sufficiently large LLM at the task seems to work for most things. Aside from that, the potential of fine tuning on the 32k gpt-4 model has not even been fully realized.\n\nTwo decades sounds like a ridiculous estimate to me, especially when companies like Domo etc. are releasing gpt powered data pipelines that should address what you\u2019re talking about far quicker than 20 years.\n\nCan you explain which major hurdles you see as significantly limiting their useability in enterprise use cases?",

They don\u2019t have data policies. They don\u2019t understand data security. The leaders don\u2019t even have data to do their jobs. I\u2019m not talking neural nets. These companies can\u2019t create data warehouses, or data lakes. The large private companies are the same way. They have 20+ year old technology. They don\u2019t have strategic tech leaders to explain to them why it\u2019s important, meanwhile they copy shit data around the world that\u2019s all out of sync. The people who have been in charge know oil, energy, healthcare, government, education, banking and insurance. They don\u2019t know tech. For the most part, they don\u2019t want to know it. \n\nYou need to solve the problem of these companies realizing they need a comprehensive data strategy so they can leverage AI. They need to stop the political drama. They need put money into the transformation. \n\nIn reality, some 500-1000 person energy company with good data and technology will end up capitalizing the energy market. Then we\u2019ll put up regulation to stop them from doing it, keeping the oligarchs. They\u2019ll be bought eventually. A generation of leaders later will understand the importance. They\u2019ll fuck it up at first, and implement it better after they learned how and why they messed it up. So yeah, 10-20 years.\n\nThe bottle neck is not technology or the new tech company with an offering.",

The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.\n\nAnd the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.\n\nI take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. \n\nShould it be this way? No.\n\nDoes it totally eliminate any thesis comparing them to consumer-oriented company sales or margins? Absolutely. It's an apples and oranges comparison.",

Then COVID19 happened and everyone got government checks and stayed home to play games, but more importantly another crypto boom happened.  The crypto market went proof of stake, which means you won't be using Nvidia GPU's to mine crypto.  To the day the #2 GPU used on Steam is the GTX 1060, a 2016 graphics card.  The #1 GPU used is a GTX 1650, which isn't much better.  Pretty clear Nvidia's been overpricing their graphic cards for a long time, and now they're riding an AL boom that doesn't exist.  No tech companies is currently spending more money that would buy Nvidia's AI chips.  Nvidia's last quarter has seen a loss in income in everything but automotive.  The only reason people are jumping on Nvidia is the same reason they're on Tesla, because they've done well in the past and to these people what Nvidia does is mystical.  Also these bulls are looking for anything that goes up and their collective mind has settled on Nvidia.",

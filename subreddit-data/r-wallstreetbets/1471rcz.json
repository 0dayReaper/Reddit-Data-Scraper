Nikkei will go to the moon  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ueda-san: Yeah but this YCC I have no clue what to do about it. If I remove it and it turns out that inflation was just supply shock driven then we are fucked and if I don't abandon it and inflation turns out to be structural then we are fucked as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;K: Well yeah that is a problem. The only thing you guys can do is do everything by surprise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ueda-san: Oh hey J is on the line. Let me get you on a conference call.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;K: Yeah bye. Have fun!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ueda-san: Hey J what\u2019s up?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;J: Everything is fine from up here.

I must extend my sincerest apologies for my prolonged absence. Regrettably, I should not have left everyone in suspense during the collapse of the SVB. I must confess that I was not at my finest during those moments, as I foresaw the subsequent events, reminiscent of Bear Stearns's exit liquidity. However, dwelling on the past serves little purpose, for what has occurred is beyond our control.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now, many of you may be curious about my presence here. Wasn't I expected to return around 2028-29? Well, my esteemed folks, I have returned earlier because it seems that irrational exuberance has once again seized the collective consciousness. Animal spirits have reemerged from the abyss and permeated Wall Street. Suddenly, everyone is proclaiming, \"The money printer is back on!\" \"We're destined for astronomical gains!\" \"S&amp;P $5000, here we come!\" \"There's bound to be an enormous MAMU ( Mother of all Meltups ) because everyone is bearish,\" and so on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Therefore, I pondered why not end my hiatus prematurely. Let us debunk the bullish sentiments and remind everyone that interest rates currently stand at 5.25%, not 0%. The government is not distributing stimulus checks; instead, it requests repayment through student loans. The treasury is also looking to replenish Tga this yr by around a trillion and there is this uncertainty over BOJ policy. Thus, instant economic recovery should not be anticipated. It is China, not the USA, that engages the money printer/lowering rates. A considerable portion of the population struggles to afford nutritious food with a solitary job, resorting to multiple employments merely to make ends meet. Virtually anyone earning less than $70,000 per annum lives paycheck to paycheck or dwells in their parents' basement. The current generation faces significant challenges in purchasing homes, among countless other reasons that we shall delve into as this series progresses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEwwwww that was not what I was expecting. I just had to try it guys but wasn't it so cringe?  It didn't feel real and heart to heart. Therefore, expect still a language of an 8yr old from me. So without any further delay let's just get started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recap :**\n\nSeason 2 sucked! Yeah, I completely agree with you guys. I fucked up. Things got so complicated that I never really tried to update my original script. I was no longer relying on the new coming data but was just looking at things from the perspective as if it was early 2022. But it does not mean we should just move on. First, we need to learn from our mistakes, and yes by we mean I. So therefore let\u2019s first take a quick detour that where did things go wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Oct 2nd week: We called this the bottom and we went max long. And we absolutely nailed it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nov 2nd week: When SPX hit its target of above $4k I told everyone to sell their tactical positions and start building short positions but not to go all in and short level by level. I was sure that Q1 2023 was going to be a disaster.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nov 4th week: I was absolutely convinced that after \u201cThanksgiving dinner SPX $4100\u201d markets will start marching towards its $3200 target. Little did I know about the consequences of my decision and what a horrible mistake will that turn out to be.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Last week of December: I was coming back from my vacation and I was so happy that SPX was trading around $3800. I thought this was it the \u201cMinsky moment\u201d shall arrive anytime now. But unfortunately, it never did. So high Vix Jan never happened.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Last week of Jan: I reanalyzed things after SPX again went for $4100 and every time I did my calculations were always pointing to this Q1 disaster that no one really was positioning for.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Feb 19: On my birthday I had to write another newsletter convincing everyone that March was 100% going to be a disaster and SPX shall be trading at $3200 because of this double top pattern. Now that I look back I should\u2019ve known better than that  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cFuck your puts, Fuck your calls  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hopping like a kangaroo, your inverse portfolio falls\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;March 3rd week: I wrote my final Newsletter titled S02E08 about the Banking crisis Recession and I came up with the two most basic and simplest theories. Either you crash right now with a bear flag breakdown pattern or use the invalidation case called bear stern exit liquidity ie. crash 9 weeks later with an H&amp;S pattern. I even took some profits off the table coz I forgot to book some in December leg down. But then due to the wrong assessment of financial markets, I deployed them early.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Learning from our Mistakes :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\\- Never try to time markets  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Never ever forget the above rule coz even though you time markets with a perfect date it doesn\u2019t do anything. ( Learned it in Season 1 )  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Markets can go sideways for a long time and hence be irrational longer than you can remain insolvent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Don't underestimate the power of the Federal Reserve.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Start making models and AI algos with ChatGPT you moron.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I have learned from my mistakes except the last one. Yes, I am a moron but I promise you guys that I will not repeat the above mistakes again. I hope we can build trust from here point on coz trust is all that we have. So let\u2019s analyze things from a new perspective and let\u2019s see what markets are trynna tell us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Experiment :** \n\n**\"Correlation coefficients on the monthly time frame\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this experiment what we are going to do is first we are going to study the changes that are taking place across the whole asset class on a monthly scale. A lot of beliefs are going to change and people have to get used to these upcoming changes.\n\nSo let\u2019s build a solid foundation from ground zero and see what possible moves can we play depending upon the incoming data. We will play the safest and most logical moves we know in times when we have our doubts about the coming data from not only the Chinese but the US government as well. Now some people like to say they are manipulating it but let\u2019s just go with the data is lagging. The blame and accusations game is for the lawyers, media, politics, and social media. We are here to make a calculated bet. And if it pays off then I guess it was all worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo let\u2019s just deep dive right in.\n\n*-&gt; a. Stock market vs Bond yields.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUSA :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly Time frame on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/xiiyiv46fc5b1.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=af9971f8ecc1f674951cd271de14c24f42277f89)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe above graph is an SPX-US10y bond yield correlation graph. The green color indicates a +ve while orange indicates a -ve correlation. Higher green lines to the upside mean strongly +ve and higher red lines to the downside means strongly -ve. What +ve means is if SPX goes up then US10y goes up and they are +vely correlated. Always remember if US10y goes up then the price of bonds goes down. Hence stock price up and bond price down is a \u201cNegative correlation\u201d and this correlation is clearly visible on the R.H.S. i.e. monthly graph. There are lots of green colors lines indicating for the past 20yr we were living in this world of \u201cNegative correlation\u201d But then inflation happened and that\u2019s why we are seeing those red lines emerging on the monthly time frame indicating for the past 2yr we have been in \u201cPositive correlation\u201d i.e. stocks and bonds price were selling off or going up together and that is why the usual 60-40 stocks and bonds allocation didn't work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now as you can see from L.H.S. that things have changed on the weekly time frame. We are going back to the \u201cNegative correlation\u201d where the stock price is inversely proportional to the bond price i.e. bond yields are going up with stock price and vice versa. This correlation got triggered after the \u201cBanking crisis\u201d where we saw a little bit of resteepening of the curve and bond yields just crashed i.e. bond price went up but the stock price went down. It\u2019s one of the chapters of the \u201cRecession playbook\u201d that many investors were looking to deploy myself included in 2H 2023 but things happened so quickly that no one saw it coming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A more clear picture of what is happening in the financial world](https://preview.redd.it/ut3ufwajic5b1.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8fe7425d59263dd5c3bcb3b12ec07dd9256122c8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean for us?\n\nWell in a shorter time frame i.e. weekly and daily we have a \u201cnegative correlation\u201d of the past 20yrs. What this means is people are optimistic right now that inflation is easily heading back down to 2% and that everything is going back to being normal.\n\nAs for a longer time frame i.e. monthly: \u201cWe are still in a strong Positive correlation\u201d of something new that has never happened in our lifetime. So anyone trading after 1998 has never experienced this correlation in his lifetime. Now this is something a biased person would say. An unbiased person would say well if you open trading view CC things have started to slightly turn there on a monthly scale. That means this inflation is going to go away soon so in a year out you could have downside risk to inflation rather than upside risk which we had in 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJapan &amp; Germany :\n\nSo now what I did was I tried this not only for SPX but for other Index like FTSE, DAX, and NI225 vs bond yields. The results were a bit meh. Japan was lagging a bit. They still are not convinced and fully 100% onboard Titanic that we are going into another world hence the relation b/w stocks and bonds price is still \"Negatively correlated\" on a monthly scale. Ueda-san still needs more time to be absolutely convinced that this is not just a supply shock inflation but rather a structural inflation. Who knows maybe he is waiting for those red lines to emerge on a monthly scale coz that\u2019s when a \u201cPositive correlation\u201d emerges in stock and bond prices. But tbh all the hard work goes to Abenomics. Things really turned around for Japan in 2012 when Shinzo Abe came back to the office.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in NKY-JP10y](https://preview.redd.it/pm6yts6jaf5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=63aaf5a5fd9bd6e0546022de88f5c0b92a580fcf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for Germany, they are a bit ahead of the USA on weekly and lagging on the monthly time frame and believe in shorter time frames that inflation is about to go away soon. But why is that some of you may wonder? Well imo I think its coz of the 1% drop in the inflation rate from 7.1% to 6.1%. USA hasn't had that yet but it is coming in June CPI which releases in July. A drop from 4.1% to 3.1%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in DAX-DE10y](https://preview.redd.it/ema33mz1nc5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=18d793a4256d4984299eb7f458859a11a866c472)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult:  Inconclusive result.\n\nWe should not believe that inflation is gonna be structural nor should we assume inflation is ending soon which means you guys shouldn\u2019t just go ahead and attach whatever multiple to a stock right now and cause multiple expansions in the index due to few stocks even when the Fed has said they will be H4L. Guys, we still don't know what to make of inflation after that July CPI which releases on Aug. What if after August inflation reaccelerates and goes for double digits by the end of the year or stays elevated high enough after touching 3.1% in July? I mean history has shown us inflation always comes in peaks and it has only happened 1/3 time that inflation straight went down to deflation due to Fed policy error. So if it happens this time around shouldn\u2019t everyone be prepared for it? For those who don't know but in 1921 after the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 we had a Depression with -a 40% crash in DJI. If you are interested in reading more about it then there is only one Ecom book that's actually worth reading and I have already shared it with you guys if you read my past letters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Trading view on monthly time frame indicates a reversal a soft landing or deflation coming while those above charts are kinda hinting that inflation is far from over and there could be a risk of second peak. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0txgc82fd5b1.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21e4b7e45207593e35e3ded41447875f76cacae9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*-&gt;  b. Forex market vs Bond yields.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEurusd-De10y :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right](https://preview.redd.it/9zk3ov46fc5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9aa2129c73e7eb528877288c59d3e991496d86f1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some people would argue that to study Europe you should consider France, Italy, and Spain as well. And don\u2019t get me wrong they are right but you see I am not an expert and hence I don\u2019t wanna overcomplicate stuff. Germany is the largest contributor to the European economy and so if Germany gets f\u2019ed then I am hoping Europe will get f\u2019ed as well. So what do we see here well not much tbh. It\u2019s the same thing earlier in 2022 we saw red lines on monthly and weekly meaning -ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd crashed then De10y went up meaning bonds sold off. But around  SVB we saw a +ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd went up at this time then De10y went up as well meaning bonds still sold (This was a bit strange to me coz generally if there is a deflationary shock to the system it is the dollar that gets the bid regardless of where the system cracks wide open) The monthly also showed some signs that it wants to be +ve related but then got rejected. At this point many people will be bored and be like \u201cWhat are you talking man\u201d \u201cI am more confused\u201d and \u201cJust tell me up or down\u201d Guys just hold your damn horses I will eventually get there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/837bge8zid5b1.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=48b22313ac2a63b8f8620e0411ffb84d9fbb7383\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is btw the daily time frame to express what I just said above. So what next is gonna happen as you can see from the relation graph is we were kinda in a +ve relation but then it's starting to go disappear and go back to being -ve related. Meaning Eurusd could make an H&amp;S and break down while bond yields shoot up i.e. bond prices go down. But let\u2019s not assume anything. It\u2019s still not clear. We need more data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGbpUsd - Gb10y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uimr8w66fc5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d07d7c65f14780cb15d87b378214bddbb6e6757\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now let's look at Brits. Earlier in 2022 we saw a Pension fund crisis in the UK when Gbpusd fell and so did the bond price i.e. yields went up. Gbp-usd down and Gb10y up is -ve meaning that's why you saw those red lines till October. But since then as you can see from the weekly time frame we went up but we did not go up on monthly meaning the relation should still be very strongly -ve related but some slight signs of +ve relation must have been surely visible recently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36ui4x3bld5b1.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2d7a5f201472a5322e293d76df53e2dba2de577a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can clearly see that -ve relation mostly and some slight signs of +ve but then it's mostly -ve due to strong monthly. Meaning inflation is still a huge problem in the UK and the recent data isn't helping. That's why daily has turned -ve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsdJpy - Jp10y :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/133gr356fc5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a610a856b43b8f6f13532fc3ac5652670dcdde2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore talking about Japan I would remind you that it's Usd-Jpy and not Jpy-Usd. So be careful not to get confused. So as you can see from here monthly never even went for -ve relation but weekly went for it slightly in 2023 but came back fast. Meaning in 2022 they were strongly +ve due to strong inflation but in 2023 we must have seen some slight signs of -ve relation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wq6c6oevmd5b1.png?width=1782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3697119ebdb62b2974b478d1e2bc9e1028b6a45d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is so confusing on the daily time frame. Honestly, all credit goes to the Bank of Japan always fuckin up investors who try to short JGBs and always coming to the rescue of Yen by Fx intervention whenever it looks like the currency pair is gonna fly off. There are so many distortions here but I will try my best. In 2022 we have UsdJpy going up and JP10y flat at 25bps. But in 2023 we saw the YCC band being lifted to 50bps and UsdJpy pair down i.e. -ve related. The few signs of +ve relation returning we saw back in SVB collapse. Here everyone thought the USA was gonna collapse like in 2008. So everyone rushed in for the Yen safe haven and yields collapsed due to the risk of deflation.  Something is not adding up here. So let's just leave it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDXY - Us 10y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fowy356fc5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f10f62d643d8c56504df1b7a7bf5310f3cfab067\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the only place that actually makes some sense. So as you can clearly see in 2022 we had green lines on both monthly and weekly which makes them +ve related. Meaning if Dxy went up then so did the Us10y. But that relation wanted to change somewhere around Q1 2023. We were heading down as you can clearly see from the weekly time frame but nothing happened and we just reverted back. Overall Dxy-Us10y wanted to be strongly +ve related and it is clearly visible how strong the relationship is as from the monthly time frame. So let\u2019s check the daily time frame to show what I mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5xybeoxjc5b1.png?width=1483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5e22a7875b298311d16e96733065a51c9f472645\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe relation is just perfect b/w Dxy and Us 10y which show signs of strongly +ve related.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Monthly time frame b\\/w currencies and bond yields.](https://preview.redd.it/fpsy6cqxjc5b1.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9af006387b0c80615490a12dffacac7e5ecea9ec)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know the charts aren't clear but please just bare with me on this one. The top left is your Eurusd, Top right is Gbpusd. The bottom left is your UsdJpy and on the bottom right we have Dxy. Then we have a correlation indicator on the bottom with bond yields i.e. US10y in orange, JP10y in pink, and finally EU10y in blue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult: Only the United States shows signs of very strong +ve Dxy and Us 10y and that is all we care about. We can derive everything from just here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBalance sheets: In own currency vs USD terms\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Japan: Blue, USA: Orange, China: Yellow, Italy: Pink, Germany: Green, UK: Blue](https://preview.redd.it/qgyr0hoxjc5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a39fc0f202aa04f60a6c01929ddbe7ad64898ac0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can clearly see till October every CB\u2019s were decreasing their balance sheet due to QT but ECB never said they were doing it in 2022. Also, an interesting thing to note is Japan. It is the only CB that actually decreased its balance sheet faster than anyone till 2020 times and were busy selling foreign reserves as USD was getting stronger and trying to defend the peg at 150. ( After this, I believe they bought $400B in debt again and flooded the global liquidity that Stan D. was talking about) \n\nNow some may argue the USA was the only one which was selling bonds while the rest of the were trying to inflate the debt away by running the economy hot enough. So maybe either this or there is some other mechanism to remove the debt away using fx pair which is out of my pay grade. They do so by making other entities absorb these bonds/mortgages from the CB balance sheet which rose sharply from 2020. Btw I tried testing it out using the JPY pair as well and not just the USD pair. One final thing, USA and JPY balance sheet seems to be running a mirror image so maybe they are working together to stop the recession through global collaboration like the USA exporting some parts of its inflation to Japan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8nw1coxjc5b1.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d7ddbc77e7c082b7bc41e571855b32685a268763\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion: However you look at it's not pretty clear that inflation is going away in developed countries. Japan is trying its best to import everyone's inflation. Fed, Boj, and Ecb are trying hard to export inflation. My bias of Stagflation still remains but okay there are some signs that from a monthly trading view, we are starting to see reversals i.e. inflation is going away. So let's analyze both perspectives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase 1: Deflationary spiral\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1.  June|Normal &lt; 2.5%|&lt; 4.1%|Whatever|Up|\n|2.  July|&lt; 1% Q3 Gdp|&lt; 3.2%|Fed|Top|\n|3. August|&lt; 1% Q3 Gdp|&lt; 1.1%|or|Down|\n|4. September|&lt; 1% Q3 Gdp|0.x %|Govt wants|Down a lot|\n|5. October|\\-ve Gdp|\\-ve %|\\&gt; 4%|God knows|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, inflation is high :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: -ve  (Positively correlated stock and bond price )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: +ve\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut soon inflation will go low :\n\nSo, US10y - SPX : will be +ve ( Negative correlated )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: -ve\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis means that at some point inflation will turn into deflation ( Currently its disinflation) So equity risk premia will blow up. Us yields will go down -&gt; Dxy will shoot up -&gt; Stocks will go down eventually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime taken :\n\nNormally it takes around 18 bars i.e. 546 days to go from one correlation to another on average and in my opinion it would take around 11 bars i.e. 336 days to see the bottom from here. So expect a crash like President Obama times in 2H 2024.  Now need I remind you this is a general theory and basically what you might have heard from recent interviews of Paul Tudor Jones and Drunckenmiller that they deploy this next yr when the fat pitch arrives. But recently I have seen this \"Inverse them bruh\" trend in the United States so I will not be surprised that it will play out starting July or August this yr considering the similarities to so many headlines we have been having this yr.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase 2: ReInflation Trade of the Stagflation: ( My bias )\n\nThis trade can also begin early if you have inflation &gt; 4.3% in June or &gt; 3.4% in July. So Top will shift further early.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1.  June|Normal &lt; 2.5%|&lt; 4.1%|Whatever|Up|\n|2.  July|&lt; 1% Q3 Gdp|&lt; 3.2%|Fed|Top|\n|3. August|&lt; 1% Q3 Gdp|\\&gt; 3.2%|or|Down|\n|4. September|&lt; 1% Q3 Gdp|\\&gt; August|Govt wants|Down a lot|\n|5. October|God knows|God knows|\\&gt; 4%|God knows|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, inflation is high :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: -ve  ( Positively correlated stock and bond price )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: +ve\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then inflation will go higher :\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: will still be -ve ( Still Positively correlated )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: still +ve\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall No change in correlation on a monthly scale. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase 2a &amp; 2b: What if inflation remains high and stubborn due to govt spending before the election?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- 2a) If inflation stays bounded in the range of 4-6% with rates at 5.x% and no recession with the Fed trynna cause financial repression I expect PE to be around 19-20 and all you're gonna up is due to nominal earnings going up 5% / yr. Current est 222 with E increasing 5% per yr you can do the math but in this environment trust me you don't wanna own an index but rather real hard assets like gold or a house. Or you can go pick specific stocks and generate alpha on the company making money or any narratives coz there will always be opportunities even in a bear market. Just look no further than my friend Jensen. He moonshot Nvidia many times inside a vicious bear market of 2001 where the Nasdaq fell -83%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- 2b) Let\u2019s say inflation goes for double digits starting July CPI on August then multiples get compressed to around 14-15 and earnings even with growing 5% nominal let's say 235-240 will be 15X240 min i.e. $3600 i.e. visiting Oct lows. So avoid overpriced tech and any stocks with crazy multiple handles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, you guys know that I used Stagflation - High Unemployment theory to justify the crash but we never really got the unemployment thing we were looking for. Instead what happened was Stagflation's argument started to fade away. First Gdp started to grow and then inflation just went down w/o any increase in unemployment. This all looks soft landing tbh. But if let's say inflation rises again and be stubborn then Fed may have to do more i.e. take rates to 6% and that would finally break the jobs market alongside Gdp falling. Let's see if it happens or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how to differentiate b/w these two opposing theories and why am I biased for more inflation?\n\nAns: Japan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ea0u6eoxjc5b1.png?width=1793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f07961316756e2ef9083ab114f27145f42a95c1f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJapan loves the USA Positive correlation ( here -ve red ) world of stocks and bonds price. If Nikkei moons and rips higher expect an avg 4-6% inflation in the United States. If it is gonna be back to a USA Negative correlation  ( here +ve green ) world then expect USA exceptionalism once we get through the global recession part. Btw these are my own concepts so please correct me if I am wrong. I am a student of macro as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where is the Butterfly effect theory that you promised?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell folks you see it's like a long-shot theory. So basically I saw a P.H.D. level research paper by Riksbank which said that the USA is unaffected by high-interest rates. Nothing is gonna happen but there is one major weakness of the United States i.e. the dollar. Yeah, it's kinda funny though the strongest weapon in their arsenal which makes the USA superpower is actually the Achilles heel of the United States. So you see guys USA is prone to high-interest rates but not the rest of the world. Just look at this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khvkbohkud5b1.jpg?width=1495&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=089fa3dad5ab985e7f667c210cfd583a34eb05af\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened bcoz every country except the USA has mostly 2.5yr times where their rate changes even for a fixed rate. Now think for a sec. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat if I come to your house/company tomorrow and tell you \" I am sorry sir/ma'am your fixed rate which you locked in before the hiking cycle began is not really fixed at all\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis above thing happened to one of my friend. So if default rates skyrocket in every country except the United States and recession begins early with inflation falling ( kinda what's happening in Spain ) with headlines like Asia financial crisis or European crisis then currencies of Europe and Asia will get weaker a/g dollar. Safe haven trade will kick in and interest rate differential or any other factor will get thrown out of the window. The only currency which will not is the Yen. In a deflationary crisis, Yen actually becomes stronger but let's for some reason Yen becomes weaker like it is right now I expect Dxy to easily go past 120+ or maybe 150+ like Volcker days. And that my friends is what will put an end to the inflation and cause a huge deflationary shock to the system. Not rates, just Dxy! To combat this the Fed will use CBDC's or some other measure to again save the system and then my friends I don't know what's gonna happen. Who knows maybe this is what is happening right now while everyone is partying like it's a new bull market. Usually, the hints are 2% or more drop in CPI in a month :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult: Regardless of how you see it guys I am bearish. Now doesn't matter the deflationary shock or reinflation part it is going to be bad for equities. And then one of them is good for gold and the other for bonds. So nothing has really changed for me I am still Camp Stagflation who has hedged himself for a Deflationary outcome by buying bonds. I am still 60% short and 40% long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Position :** \n\n [https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai-SLDVjdnGtkkGfO1jY1WYC\\_9\\_L](https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai-SLDVjdnGtkkGfO1jY1WYC_9_L) \n\nSorry, my image limit got hit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final thoughts :**\n\nThe real reason why I'm back is because I missed all of you, not because I wanted to smack the sh9t out of bulls. Oh, and I've also fallen back into my old drinking habits again. Now that I recall I never really explained to you guys why I drink so much, so here it goes. My girl left me because I wasn't there for her during tough times. Now she's making a ton of money while I'm stuck trying to move on. She even called me during the SVB days just to check up on me, and we spent a few days together. She is a great person though and I thought maybe I could win her back if I got my act together, which is why I stopped writing. But recently, I found out that she's got a new boyfriend now. So, I'm back to my old ways, writing doomsday posts about the upcoming crisis that no one really sees and attacking the 4 pockets of low liquidity with my bear friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnjoy the weekend everyone. \n\nSee you guys next week!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegards\n\nGabimaru\n\n( You got a problem with that? Heck even Tate is into anime girls now xD )",

No pun intended, I don't know if Gabimaru is anime persona and whether his gf left him. \n\nNevertheless this might be my first time able to get through your entire post, interesting piece on correlation and how europe is doing. \n\nI've read that Germany index is running at ath though they're technically in a recession which is kinda mad. CPI and GDP is everything going forward, I agree, but difficult to hedge and time it. As you mentioned earlier to not time the market, aka options, it's gonna be tough. I'm beating myself for not going long earlier when stocks were down in Oct 2022. :(",

            "comment": "\"Tightening lending standards\" doesn't necessarily tell you where they're tightening from, or what capital is also left addressable in the market, or who's getting tightened.\n\nIt may be a top, it may not. This, along with most datapoints (including the yield curve), are not hard rules for economic cycles... they do have underlying mechanics that explain their actions, though, and that's where the interesting meat is.\n\nDoes a yield curve predict a recession when the Fed has wildly influenced the bond market?\n\nMost people on this sub would say yes. If pressed to explain why, they would say \"it's always been this way.\" (In other words they have no fucking idea and don't have the sense or intelligence to ask why.)\n\nExcept the yield curve inversion research comes from pre-2000 (same with CAPE ratio research that people cite for overweight P/Es in the market now), prior to the existing Fed QE regime. The problem is, if you read the research on the yield curve, the mechanic for why it works is that the change in selection of yield dynamics is largely driven by expectations of the economic cycle when things are normal. In other words, it only works if it's a natural event... but QT changes the volume of bond transactions on the market creating inversion by nature of the act of engaging in QT, so the signal is not a natural reflection of investor sentiment but rather a direct outcome of Fed actions.\n\nNow that could generate a recession. Or we could just have one because we expect one... but the yield curve inversion does not mean what is implied in the hypothesis about what drives a curve inversion in those prior times, so it can absolutely be a false signal. It's kind of like saying that your car is going fast because someone is moving the speedometer needle.\n\nThe point I'm making is that contexts change the meaning of indicators. Now it may be that change in lending standards results in reduced economic activity, that's not irrational... but if there's already a ton of idle open debt balance and idle cash addressable to the market to allow it to run (there is) and as long as lending standards are more restricted at the bottom but not meaningfully impacting debt generation capability to the lower classes (they are) and as long as lending standards and capital addressable to the upper class is still liquid (it is) then the market can run barring another piece of news to keep it from doing so.\n\nThose are the mechanics. The signals don't always mean what we think they do. The bottom line is watch the tape, and don't fight it because it makes sense to you that these indicators should bring the market down... the market doesn't care about that, it only cares about liquidity in the space where it's trading, and we're currently 50 points down on the market from where existing capital last brought it, no new lending needed to get back up there.",

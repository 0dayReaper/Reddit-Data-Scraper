    "postText": "It works for me. I always pick one of the big ETFs like QQQ or SPY. Mostly QQQ which seems to be more volatile these days.\n\nWhen the RSI for one day AND five days goes below 30 (oversold) I buy deep in the money calls, at least a couple months out. They carry almost no premium. 100 contracts gives you the control of 10,000 QQQs. Good bet is August 18 $320 calls\n\nWhen the RSI for one day AND five days (marked them in red, top left corner) goes above 70 (overbought) I buy deep in the money puts, again, at least a couple months out. For now I trade August 18 $380 puts\n\nWhen I plan to buy 100 contracts I go in 20-30 contracts at the time.\n\nFor every 100 contracts, a 50 cents move brings me $5k.\n\nOf course you can play with 10 contracts or 1000, up to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe RSI for one and five days seems to be a consistent method with big ETFs.\n\nThe RSI I use is 14 days range\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ilimrhpas4b1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8f46082e466903e20bae3c7a67adee77723fbb72\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgz8nwgqas4b1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6fb2f7f08b096b699f506aad81c1d85e75f8a43f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was not aware you only pay the difference. Every day is a school day! What sort of delta do you usually target? Would 6 months or leaps not be safer or is the increased cost not worth it?",

Thereby reducing the cost price (and risk) and reducing or changing Vega and Theta dynamics? \n\nDeep in the money options trade close to a delta of 100 and have less extrinsic value, but the amount and total capital needed that you are risking is higher. Selling ATM options as second legg would reduce or change the negative elements you are trying to evade but also reduce the capital/risk required to execute the trade.\n\n(Edit); reduces capital needed by being able to choose long options that are not that far in the money.",

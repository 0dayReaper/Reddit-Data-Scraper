Absolutely\u2026 but at this point really no reason to expect a surprise at this point\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kaqnagcmtu5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fde4c7caee44708cd9996f21bce1e2ef03ec6e1a\n\nWe do indeed get some PPI data in the morning\u2026 but it would have to be extremely hot in order for feds to last minute change their minds\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33uk9ztmtu5b1.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6ec9794ab17f01b2d9dbf3dad8f3c9d2807ff861\n\nI showed you guys a very similar chart last night for CPI day\u2026 IF you had swung SPY calls it was about a 30-40% win and QQQ calls were about a 40-50% win\u2026 now I did NOT swing anything myself as I just don\u2019t think the risk to reward is there\u2026 but the odds of a red open tomorrow are pretty solid\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iucxje9ntu5b1.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ff01cfc161a6769d40224e8d833b1544d2a252b9\n\nThe last few fed meetings has seen a pretty dramatic drop EOD\u2026 actually this is super interesting as it plays out perfectly to what FOMCs have always did\u2026.   \n \n\nsell off 2pm to 230pm -&gt; 230 to 245/3pm pump -&gt; 245/3pm to EOD dump\u2026 shall we see a repeat? \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lowojynntu5b1.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4f6238e4061f33c51df7648257bd764ed1ee6f4d\n\nSpy continues to pump and actually did close out an abandoned baby pattern here\u2026 however, we did fail to reach the daily demand at 437.87\u2026. this remains our upside target for tomorrow. \n\nIf we break through 437.87 I don\u2019t have any levels until $445 area. \n\nHowever, on a red day tomorrow there actually is a pretty strong chance that bears will put in a supply off todays candle at 436.69. That would in my opinion lead to a sell off Thursday back to 429.86. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/919jkb1otu5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8e44880e85c83d02a4006e97b85b7dc430f1ae7e\n\nSPY remains in this upward black bull channel and now is coming in on the blue bull channel resistance tomorrow also\u2026\n\nBlack resistance sits at 439.7 and blue sits at 440.\n\nNow we are getting pretty over extended from the daily 8ema here and a pullback is become more and more probable\u2026. \n\nI honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised regardless of what happens tomorrow with FOMC to see a decently red open Thursday and a decent pullback\u2026 SPY actually closed its 4th green day in a row which is something that has not happened since end of march/ beginning of April. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 428.06 -&gt; 429.13   \n Demand- 429.86 -&gt; 437.87  \n Support- 435.22 -&gt; 433.85 -&gt; 430.9  \n Resistance- 436.7 -&gt; 438 -&gt; 440.5 -&gt; 443.3\n\n\\*remember futures purposefully not included till Friday\\*\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l12sskjotu5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=77458543f48585a90c487cb553f317802d5ba4e6\n\nTaking a look at QQQ today we finally hit my upside bull target of 361.7 and have officially taken that very old demand out\u2026 from here our next upside target realistically is the 369.32 to 371.41 supplies. \n\nIf we find a big bounce up tomorrow our target should be 369.32. However, with daily DMI completed to the upside and rejecting the red bull channel resistance we could actually look for a retrace to back test support at 360.5 and 357.09. \n\nDepending on what happens tomorrow QQQ is set up to put in a new daily supply (resistance) off this daily candle at 363.26\u2026 that would open up the opportunity to come back and test 357.09 and 354.95 to take out those supplies and retest the daily 8ema before putting in a new demand (Support)\u2026 \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 354.95 -&gt; 357.09 -&gt; 369.32 -&gt; 371.41  \n Demand- 349.06 -&gt; 347.93\n\n**VIX**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xo6ntu0ptu5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eba00e6a8a59f76aeb50f836fa55cc144a0ae27c\n\nNow on the daily VIX here we did close out a nice double top and rejection off the daily 8ema at exactly 15. \n\nIf the VIX was to fall tomorrow we most probably would put in a new daily supply at 15\u2026 which would open up an opportunity for the VIX to drop back to that 13.62 demand\u2026\n\nI have a theory and its complete tinfoil permabull fuel type of stuff\u2026. I was thinking about it and clearly market wants to go up and clearly its not sensible long term to fight this bull trend\u2026 so I was thinking the fact that the VIX was at precovid lows and back in the 13s really made it difficult for the VIX to go much lower which really makes it difficult for SPY to go much higher\u2026 what if with CPI and FOMC back to back and a nice pump on the VIX\u2026 that this is the vehicle SPY needed to pump to 440-450 now\u2026\n\nThink about it\u2026 SPY loves to unwind with the VIX and despite an 8% pump yesterday SPY did not drop lower\u2026 what if not when the VIX unwinds back to the low to mid 13s SPY finally has the momentum to push this to that 450 area? \n\nJust a thought\u2026 \n\nHowever then I take a look at the FG index and I see it sitting at 80\u2026 the 2nd highest level its been in the last year\u2026 Actually since July 2021\u2026 the FG index has only seen 80 or higher two times now. \n\nLets take a look at that once again\u2026\n\nNovember 9th 2021 the FG hit 77 and SPX was $4685\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $4513 and an FG index of 25 on December 1st. That would be a 3.8% drop. \n\nDecember 1st 2022 the FG hit 76 and SPX was $4077\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $3850 and an FG index of 37 on December 29th 2022\u2026 That would be a 5.9% drop.\n\nFebruary 1st 2023 the FG index hit 82 (the highest level in the last 2 years) and SPX was $4119\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $3856 and FG index hit 23 on March 13th 2022\u2026 that would be a 6.8% drop.\n\nSo on average over the last two years when the FG index has peaked at these levels\u2026 SPX has seen a 5.5% drop over 19 trading days\u2026 \n\nThat COULD mean if we are peaking here at FG 79 and SPX $4369 then we COULD see a drop to $4128 or SPY $412.5 by July 12th\u2026 However, if SPY pumps to $440 tomorrow that could look more like SPY $416\u2026 \n\nThis all plays into my theory that tomorrow FOMC will be a local top and Thursday minimally (perhaps Friday) could be a juicy retrace\u2026 \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xyv8utnptu5b1.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2b7d147c5b973614eca60b6ef96d9b3866086fc4\n\n(note that last call on SPX was a 1dte not sure why it says 2 thats an error)\n\nI am actually incredibly pleased with myself today and my trading results\u2026 I pretty much went into today thinking that \u201cthis retrace is an opportunity to go long on a call\u201d now of course I took some puts and I did win nicely on some of those puts\u2026 today was low % win types of day because 0dte premiums were so high in the AM and then when you switch to 1dte your premiums are so juicy you don\u2019t see much of a win\u2026 \n\nOverall though a great day of trading where I was able to make up all of yesterdays losses and then some\u2026 \n\nI have said it before and ill say it again\u2026 risk management is the key to success and profitability\u2026 Yesterday I struggled for sure and had a red day\u2026 however, I was able to successfully manage and mitigate those losses to the point where one trading day got me back to green and back up over my daily profit goal (if you subtracted yesterdays losses from todays wins). \n\nI look forward to trading tomorrow and some of the volatility that will follow with that!",

I hope we do open up red so I can exit a few and maybe rebuy if we rise up going into the meeting for a discount. \n\nI feel like no matter what is said we are selling off into Friday and next week. I\u2019m gonna try and catch the Tsla pump with a few puts too.  Markets on meth, who knows when it will pull back some. I hope to catch it and maybe this will be the narrative to make it happen.",

Palantir Technologies Inc. and Panasonic Energy Co., have sealed the deal on a multi-year bromance to build a \"Smart Factory\" in the middle of nowhere, Sparks, Nevada. They're bringing in Palantir's AI baby, the Foundry platform, to yeet sensors all over the factory lines and crank out automation like nobody's business.\n\nBut hold onto your tendies, they're also planning to inject this big-brain AI system into the veins of Panasonic's existing Nevada factory and a spanking new Kansas facility set to pop off in 2025. And the cherry on this diamond-handed plan? Buckets of cost savings and ROIs that would make even a Wall Street wolf drool.\n\nThe future's coming in hot with Foundry's AI/ML. They're kicking manual processes to the curb faster than a short squeeze, ramping up uptime, and slashing defects. It's time for one small step for Palantir and Panasonic, one giant leap for factory-kind, boys! Rocket to the moon, let's go! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

Tesla and GM have already said they plan to release a similar one for Supercharging; it's basically just about the price now. \n\nAs far as where I'll charge, honestly this is a pure benefit for me. I'll just continue to do what I always do, which is look on the PlugShare app, see if anyone commented that the station nearest to me isn't working, and if not, use it. Aside from needing to buy said adapter mentioned above, the only thing this changes for me as a consumer is there will be 15,000 new stations for me to choose from in less than a year.",

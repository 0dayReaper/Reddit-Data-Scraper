Take off gloves.  \n\nYou already wear eye protection all day.\n\nSo, instead you wear AR Goggles (impact rated for industrial use), your keyboard is wherever you start typing, your touch screen is projected in front of you, inventory is actively managed as you work.  And quality controls are built in to prevent mis-use or correct mid-labeled items in real time.  Productivity increases, fewer employees needed.  \n\nAnd there we go, $3500 investment to improve productivity, reduce waste, improve QC; and a single device to maintain instead of 3.",

A better comparison would be you have a 40K monitor and you don't actual have anything other than a 40K monitor on the market to use.

This is a suped up version of a type of product that\u2019s been around since virtual boy. Whether or not it goes the way of 3D tvs? Who\u2019s to say? I do think that at a price point of (starting at?!) $3,500 it\u2019s not gonna sell a lot and Apple might take a bath on it. Not even mentioning the inherent problems that will arise when reality sets in for the early adopters who buy the stuff and find flaws or limitations. \n\n\u201cThe cord sticks out of one side and it\u2019s too short. The battery gets too hot. The lens gets foggy when I sweat. I got drunk when I was wearing it and passed out in it and now the widget thing is broken. I dropped it and now xyz doesn\u2019t work. My boss FaceTimed me while I was watching porn.\u201d\n\nI have a feeling there\u2019s gonna be some interesting things that come out of its rollout. Idk if average people are going to save up 3 months rent to shell out on a potentially fragile AF device. \n\nThey\u2019re gonna have to sell 1m units to make back the costs and they\u2019re gonna have to rely on other divisions of devices to float them for a while.",

For Amp you will need a minimum balance of like $200 in your account to use the charting platforms I believe. So even to trade play money  you'd have to have some money in there if you wanna use the fancy tools. There's also commissions per trade but they are very reasonable. It's like $5 a month for the data feed to have real time data. More if you want to see multiple depth levels beyond the current bid/ask. I wouldn't bother with that.",

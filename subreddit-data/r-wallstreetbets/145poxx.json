So by my math he is losing $8000 minus his premium on that trade.\n\nHe is making money on the options contracts where the strike is above his cost base. He gets premium plus the difference between his cost base and the strike price. This would be $220-$205= $15 per share. So for $44,000 at $220 we have 200 shares. Total gain is $3000 plus premium. Then $32.50 times 100, which is $3250, plus premium. So we have an actual gain/loss as -8000+3000+3250 = -$1750 plus whatever premium he got.\n\nHowever if he didn\u2019t do this he would have had market price minus his cost base time # of shares. So like $245-205 = $40 times 700. This comes out to $28,000.\n\nOP is regarded.\n\nBy your way, total payout is $141,750. Total cost is $205 times 700 shares, is $143,500. Total loss is $1,750. But he got premium from his contracts so he could have made some money as long as it was more that $1,750. But no matter what he lost out on $28,000 because he had to sell his shares.",

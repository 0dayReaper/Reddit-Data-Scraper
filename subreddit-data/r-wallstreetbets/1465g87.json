At some point, your business\u2018 ability to do it on pure facts will run out of steam. Case in point: TSLA P/E is 65. \n\nLet that sink in. If you\u2019re buying now, you need 65 years of current earnings to cover it. Even your 5-year PEG ratio is about 2.7. So, even at expected aggressive growth rates, you\u2019re still looking at almost 3 years. And that will only get longer if the price goes up further. \n\nEven if you claim that \u201eTesla is a tech company\u201c, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Google has a P/E of 28, Apple is at 30, Samsung is at 9. C\u2018mon. \n\nSo how are you going to \u201edestroy the shorts\u201c then? Hype. As Elon always does. And that will inevitably fall on its face at some point. \n\nWill Tesla soar in a general market rally? Sure. Thanks to irrationality in the markets. Will people wake up at some point? You bet.",

Apple is expected to grow eps at 6% a year whereas Tesla is expected to grow eps at 26% a year and I personally think it will probably be higher. That means in 5 years if the price is the same for both, Apples P/E would be ~22 and Teslas would be ~20.

I don't like google, they have been flailing for far too long, they are in the corporate lifecycle where theh either find their own Nadella, or they Kodak/Intel. Likewise Amazon. Too much bureocracy, too much flailing around without real vision, too much money wasted on dead projects with no real follow through.   \n \nBut I think AI will be quite the unique situation, since it's most likely to replace a large amount of middle to upper middle class jobs rather than the typical tech rev that replaces low class low skill jobs. It will be quite interesting to live through the next couple decades.   \n \nCouple that with what Microsoft is doing with hololens (the supporting software not the hardware) and I wouldn't be surprised to see in the next 30-40 years a trend away from big cities back to smaller towns.  \n \nYou get AR to function properly, which is a long way out, and you can hire only the most talented from across the globe for a lot of jobs. And with that you don't need to live in a big city with high property tax, high crime, high cost of living. Etc.  You can live in a smaller satellite town with good infrastructure.  \n  \nThis solves the housing situation for many, this solves traffic issues, this makes companies cheaper since they don't need to have huge offices, it reduces greenhouse and other gasses. Etc etc etc.   \n \nBut it would utterly collapse most modern cities, since they seem to be unable or jnwilling to stop blowing as much money as they can make as fast as they can on absolutely nothing.  \n  \nMaybe I'm wrong, but to me that's the most efficient way to move forward, and the most efficient is typically the way things go.    But you throw in AI replacing a lot of jobs and who knows what will happen. Lots of people make a lot of money completing extremely mundane tasks that could easily be automated by capable AIs when they get to that level.. and it's not far off.   I have absolutely no idea how that will impact the world.",

Im not Sure what the sales for all of USA are for this year so far but Q2 earning will be out in a few weeks and set to beat the last quarter quite nicely. And while in the US its behind Toyota last year third place still shows its pretty well loved and Id not be surprised to see it take the second or first place at the end of this year when final sales are announced. So ye pretty well loved world over. And only getting bigger every quarter.",

I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.\n\nThat is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

Clearly it\u2019s overbought, a pull back is due and the recent uptrend of consecutive up days is unprecedented, however, stocks like Tesla defy reason and play mostly with the FOMO crowd at this level and it seems like Musk is doing everything he can to regain the trillion dollar valuation again.  I would not bet against the richest man in the world and the support of the US government with subsidies and incentives.   My opinion is we trend up and down until we see 300 and correct back to a trading range of 245/300 until Q 3 when we regain the 350+ range and trillion dollar valuation.\n\nDon\u2019t trade on this post - only my opinion.",

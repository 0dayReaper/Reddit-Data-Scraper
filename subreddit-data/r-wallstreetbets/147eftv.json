Before a 25 PE was ideal, more meant it was overly inflated and risky.  205 is absurd, and even tho earnings will grow, price will too. My comment was that nothing makes sense anymore. \n\nUnless AMD gets pricing power in comparison to nvda for AI (not even close yet), nvda holds dominance. I tried to set up stable diffusion on a good laptop (non nvda) and it took 30 mins to generate an img2img of a cat. My 3070 made it in less than a minute.",

This isn\u2019t a game changer in tech, just a massive set of algorithms to make it seem like it\u2019s intelligent. Give it a year and you\u2019ll see it drop.

NVDA's 'other business lines' are down revenue from last year.\n\nNVDA up 170% YTD, even at 100% that's almost 500bn of it's market cap coming from of AIAIAI. No doubt AI will be useful in the future but I can't imagine buying NVDA anywhere near 400 - but I guess it doesn't matter what I think, as some people much smarter than I am, are - and that's it's current price lol.  \n\n\n[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) up 234% YTD should givhint that valuations a  have room to come down in the future imo.",

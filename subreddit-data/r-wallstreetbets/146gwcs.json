People somehow still have money when we have had inflation for 2 years. I don't get it, where is this money coming from? I would have thought we would have been in a full fledge medium size recession by now, but nope. However I think the stock market has topped out basically or close to it. I guess the market falls when everyone gets there confidence back that there is no recession then they pull the rug.",

However, it is a fixer upper that we've spent close to $100k on and tons of sweat equity.  It's hopefully going to be our retirement rental along with my parents' house and grandparents' farmhouse. That will allow us to build a new home on the family farm and have a pretty good income. We're on track to retire early.  We also hit the jackpot.

What if they destroy the house?  What if you can't find a renter?\"  I bought my first house in 2010 and it'll be paid off in less than two years.  All the same people who were trying to talk me out of keeping it as a rental are now telling me how they should have bought one when they were younger.  And I say \"why not now?\" and immediately get told the EXACT same shit that I was told when I got mine....\"what if they decided to stop paying rent to me?  I can't afford that!\"",

Obviously, my buddies who didn\u2019t start out with much but were good at managing their money are now fairly well-off. Some people are smart and deliberate when it comes to managing money and others aren\u2019t (either never taught how, don\u2019t have the self-discipline, or they don\u2019t care). Sure having more money/resources can make things easier to manage but proper money management has a far greater upside for those with less resources. \n\nPoor people get paid every two weeks like most people. One pay check usually goes mostly towards rent while the other covers their food and other expenses for the month. Poor people still have the option to spend most of their monthly food budget upfront for a bulk discount if they want (I\u2019ve known many who do and I\u2019ve had periods where I basically had to). Not sure why you\u2019re acting they\u2019re forced to waste it on McDonald\u2019s/ Gas station food.

Historically speaking PET plastic prices (the type your average water bottle is made out of) and economic health are directly correlated. \nWhen demand and consumer spending is high consumer packaged goods companies spend like crazy on PET plastic and sheet aluminum. A year and a half to two years ago we were selling PET at 40 cents per lb and aluminum at over $1.00 per lb to mills. \n\nPrices have fallen through the floor. PET prices are now at 8 cents a lb and aluminum is at about 68 cents. Mills are not purchasing material and CPG companies foresee a slowdown in purchasing. \n\nI linked an article. It\u2019s a little dated but it backs up what i was saying about pricing and the correlation between economic health and PET prices. \n\nhttps://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2022/08/09/prices-collapse-for-post-consumer-plastics/amp/\n\n* also I guess you can say recessions are subjective.

Approximately 30 percent of the container needs to be from recycled material. This was not the case until 2019ish. So the only reason PET prices are at 8 cents right now and not at 0 is because companies are forced to use it. Basically what I\u2019m trying to get at is demand is very low.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, the exhaustion of irrational exuberance is almost impossible to predict.\n\nBut there are 2 signs you should watch:\n\n**JOBS** = No matter what anyone says, it's all about jobs. even shitty paying ones.  70% of the US GDP comes directly from people buying and spending on stuff. Not businesses. People. And If people are working, they are spending.\n\n1. Whether it's directly related to working: Buying a car, insurance, gas, lunch downtown, new clothes, etc., or\n2. Indirectly - Just buying stuff that you couldn't before because you didn't have money - Ex. Tinder Gold sub, drinks for \"independent\" bitches who can never find their wallet, etc.\n\n**STUDENT LOANS** = This one is unique to our current situation. I've tried explaining this to people but it's hard to properly quantify how much it is affecting consumption.\n\nFor 3 years now, approx 98% (see below) of all student loan borrowers have paid ZERO towards their loans. The interest is being deferred - Welfare is important, and it's not just for Corporations! Let me put it in Stonk talk - That's an insane amount of Free Cash Flow that did not exist prior to Covid rescue act.\n\n**Anecdotal example**: My GF has $450,000 in student loans - (Wellesley Undergrad, and then Columbia for a Masters in Epidemiology and her Medical Degree, and finally a fellowship in Pediatric Gastroenterology at Albert Einstein college of medicine = I added this info to avoid 100 responses telling me my GF is an idiot and spent too much money and is probably trying to get a job as an influencer at Tok-Tik)\n\nHer loan payment (at a very low interest rate) was still around $4,500 a month. If she had decided to join the 90% of borrowers who stopped paying, she would have added an extra $55,000 a year in after-tax disposable income. That is a lot of goddamn money. I know my GF is a high $ example, but it's not as rare as you think.\n\nThere are two classes of borrowers - The people who would literally end up with zero debt, if $20,000 were forgiven.\n\nAnd then the second class, the ones who gleefully borrowed 100K a year, because they were promised that upon graduation, they would quickly outdistance their non-college degree counterparts. (Random rant - that shit made sense when college tuition was 5k a year. With tuition at 50k plus, the math is a complete fucking failure, but they won't put out any new studies to tell you so).\n\nConclusion: When student loans actually restart (not when they claim the loans will restart) ADD 90 days for the effects to trickle through to spending and earnings - and that's your collapse.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pirlsdb3jg5b1.png?width=1267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bec4baaeef66bf3361374a507ab5000b06fe849d\n\n[United States Private Consumption: % of GDP - CEIC CEIC Data https://www.ceicdata.com \u203a ... \u203a United States](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/united-states/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=United%20States%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted,an%20average%20share%20of%2063.3%20%25.)",

            "comment": "What's happened, if you look at the inflation data, is that consumers are shifting between sectors based on context. Inflation isn't constantly up across the board, it's up heavily in specific sectors before inflation in that sector settles out, then another gets the pressure. This is flattening out a bit over time, and that's causing the dynamics you're seeing.\n\nThis was entirely predictable if you looked at this period through a pandemic/human patterns lens rather than a traditional inflation/recession lens.\n\nThere's also a ton of pull forward for capital in banks, and during 2021 wages largely caught up to existing inflationary trends. They're now down below forward looking pressure necessary to cause significant inflation, below the high watermark for real wage growth that has historically been present during 2% inflation (which is about 5% real wage growth... people don't spend their money at increase linearity, how they spend depends a lot on the debt cycle and you have to account for forward inflation... if inflation is 5% and wage increases are 5%, for instance, you don't have 5% extra pressure on prices, you have price equilibrium - i.e. no inflationary pressure from wages even as spending and demand stays high, but that also depends on adjusting for supply pressure to find the real inflationary pressure).\n\nThis is the cycle that's confounded everyone. Everyone's using the wrong model for economic cyclicality here because we're mapping economic patterns from changes of capital regime or standard consumer cycles to a pandemic cycle where 45% of M2 was pulled forward and where consumer demand requirements (and access to capital) are entirely unlike any prior economic cycle for which we have good data.\n\nThe last similar cycle was the Spanish Flu, and we honestly do not have great data relating to human economic patterns... but what we do have supports all of the above and the result was 10 years of expansion. You have a similar story relatively (relatively lol) well documented with the Black Plague in Europe and that caused an extended period of prosperity once it resolved. It also probably was the last straw and toppled Feudalism as an economic organizational system.\n\nPeople will now say \"Ah-hah! But then came the Great Depression!\" which... Ok... maybe... but you have to burn out the growth cycle first, and we haven't even if it feels that way.\n\nNote: I'm not saying we can't have a further economic pullback...pullbacks happen cyclically, but there's a lot of confusion on this sub as to why things aren't just crashing down, and this is why.",

Your observation carry\u2019s over to a lot of other areas. We went bowling the other day and was $45 for one lane for one hour.

FED ain\u2019t lowering rates any time soon. \n\nSo yeah, everyone spends every cent they get. That doesn\u2019t mean it will help avoid any recession. \n\nIf anything, it will be the cause of the recession.",

All the worst economic decision makers who are hundreds of thousands in debt right after school for bad degrees and no skills for the first time ever, got an extra few thousand a month to spend on whatever they want while Biden paused their payments, they have been spending like crackheads on jubilee because the money isn\u2019t real to them. Think about it. Look around you and ask the worst economic decision makers in your life how they are spending their money since student loan pause. Listen to them eat their checks.",

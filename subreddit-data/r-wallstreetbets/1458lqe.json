If they don't and hint at futures hikes I'm sure the market will take a dive too.\n\nSold the tesla puts at $1.50 and will keep the QQQ puts. I will sell if they go below $28 for a $23k loss but I think QQQ will drop below $350 considering the RSI is at 72 and stocks like tesla have an 88 RSI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtfcgwnxi05b1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6dafe070453682289122768e750fd785033b2658\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

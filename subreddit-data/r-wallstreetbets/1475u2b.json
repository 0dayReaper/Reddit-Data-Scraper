    "postText": "Adobe releases their ER on Thursday and because of AI und how they included AI in their company especially in Photoshop I Think, that Adobe could jump up to 15% from its current price. Asked around for this play and most of the people said it\u2019s gonna be positive, but the only thing I\u2019m questioning is, the Revenue is maybe not as good as expected and I have trouble to decide if it\u2019s gonna be a money making Call. Personally me and AI think that the earning per Stock is gonna be big positive so thanks for ur advise in the comments.\nRegards, Regard",

Their FireFly AI is not priced into ADBE subscription numbers yet which should definitely increase by Q3, and any analyst needs to ask themselves what is the current AI anyway???  Its 2 things...\n\n1. Large Language Models (ChatGPT)\n2. Stable Diffusion (Adobe Firefly -- or to some nerds who use terminals there is the \\*opensource and not profitable\\* Deforum plugin as well as a host of other websites and apps (kaiber, etc) that are trying to copy what Adobe FireFly is going to do in 1 single app that most are already familiar with.  But they are also all subscription based and now going to be competing against the Adobe FireFly, which should have way more features altogether.\n\nSo who are the main beneficiaries right now of 'AI'?  I'd say MSFT, NVDA, and ADBE.  Perhaps some other companies that will take what all these free stable diffusion / LLM applications can do and implement it into their software like SHOP so people can make e-commerce more streamlined - auto SEO, auto product description writing, and similar photo manipulation features. Either way - Adobe will be a huge beneficiary of the 'Stable Diffusion' model of AI and will be a better subscription than something like MidJourney.  \n\nAs for ER its def a gamble considering the macro econ news this week but i'd buy the next major dip if there is one.\n\n\\---\n\ntldr, inverse VM.  Adobe to 500$+",

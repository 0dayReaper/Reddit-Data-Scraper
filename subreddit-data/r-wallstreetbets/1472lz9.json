ResMed is an Australian sleep apnea specialist that is dual listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Australian Stock Exchange.\n\nI will be looking forward to their announcement of their AirSense 12 which they have been working on since 2020.\n\nResMed Options chain is very empty too  &lt;\\*.\\*&gt;",

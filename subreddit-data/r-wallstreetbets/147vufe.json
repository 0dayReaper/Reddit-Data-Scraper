People treat our hospital emergency departments like walk in clinics here and go to it if they have a cold or flu. Those stories you hear about people waiting 12 hours in the hospital to see a doctor, its because they have shoulder pain, or a stomach bug. We see triage people. Actual emergencies get seen right away, all others wait because its not important.\n\nI had someone at work go with chronic stomach pain for a week, they did a ultrasound and found ovarian cyst. Operation the next day\n\nMy daughter caught a virus related to RSV a few months ago. We noticed some labored breathing, we went to the ER, they took her vitals and noticed low blood oxygen, she was admitted on the spot and given oxygen.",

There are free clinics everywhere, yes you wouldn't want to go to them if you have insurance but if you migrated here, have a job paying cash under the table and need something taken care of there's a million safe guards to keep you from dying in the street. I'm not mad about it, people need healthcare in a first world country.

            "comment": "Canadian here, and from what I can see is exactly this!  With the interest rate rising and people trapped in their mortgages, the best bet is to extend them out, qnd the banks are doing it.  It is the only reason we haven't seen home prices falling, no defaults and strong home prices, nobody will sell for less than what they \"think\" is of fair value.  Well, I'll tell you right now, we are in for a rude awakening, we seen in it in 2008 with the US financial market, I think it's coming home to Canada!  You can't make hay when the sun isn't shining, and it's under a dark cloud right now!",

They may not have been sub prime on the way in, but they are def subprime on the way out.",

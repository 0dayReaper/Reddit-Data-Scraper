    "postText": "# Market-moving News\n\n**The fight against inflation is not over.**\n\n\u2022\tThe Bank of Canada raised the policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%, and ECB is hinting another hike might be necessary. Good reminders that the fight against inflation is not over. \n\n\u2022\tMeanwhile back in the US, the Fed had gone silent this week before the FOMC meeting next week. The market has largely priced in a pause in June. Given the goldilocks economic data in the past month, it is unlikely for the Fed to surprise the market with either more hawkish or dovish languages at the meeting.\n\n\u2022\tOn the other hand, China and Japan are continuing their loose credit policies as these countries worry more about deflation rather than inflation.\n\n\u2022\tAs for liquidity, we know TGA will be refilled, and we know the Fed is on track with QT, and both are bad for the market, so RRP is the most important thing to watch here. RRP declined this week, but in small amounts. TGA increase is also small so the total liquidity proxy mostly decreased due to Fed QT. A small divergence appeared between liquidity and S&amp;P 500 performance. I will continue to monitor if liquidity is indeed on a declining trend, which could be toxic for the market.\n\nWeekly summary of inflation news\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xf24pftce5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8001a53d82cbc06fde7888a409b8cac44b6f039e\n\nSummary from previous weeks\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18mcvvuuce5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0f2aeea6386de06fa5a7f78c6ed73ef62d6d0d61\n\n[Divergence appeared between liquidity and market performance](https://preview.redd.it/c4w7lh72de5b1.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6d89c4da3e2e7f75cdf36cf9a406f7082d161f93)\n\n[RRP is the key to watch as it will determine liquidity change in H2.](https://preview.redd.it/hp8crja1de5b1.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb2c8f35e718a2780788bed1934a46d95c7df4bd)\n\n**US and global economy: Not a lot of data this week, but sentiment is lifted from better-than-expected PMI and World Bank raising 2023 economic growth forecast.**\n\n\u2022\tISM and SP global service PMI was slightly lower than expected but new orders increased. Lower price charged and lower service PMI lifted investor\u2019s sentiment as inflation pressure continued to decrease.\n\n\u2022\tWorld bank raised 2023 global economic outlook and Fed\u2019s GDPNow model indicated US Q2 GDP at a mild 2.2%. \n\n\u2022\tUS recession risk is also start to fade due to these 3 factors:\n\n1. Accumulated savings: Households have saved approximately $2.1 trillion between March 2020 and August 2021, but around $900 billion remains. High-income households may hold a significant portion of these savings, potentially impacting spending patterns.\n2. Pent-up demand for services: Spending on services has increased, driven by pent-up demand and a desire to make up for lost time. However, as this demand is satisfied, consumption growth may slow. Some retailers have observed weakness in discretionary categories, suggesting a potential consumer pullback.\n3. Tight labor markets: Labor shortages persist due to early retirements and reduced immigration during the pandemic. While overall employment has increased, certain sectors like leisure and hospitality have not fully recovered lost jobs. Job openings exceed the number of unemployed, but there are early signs of normalization, with job quit rates, hours worked, and wage growth starting to decrease while jobless claims rise.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/674pp0q6de5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c7d0b8f46981de6b3d271d472ecd5b72be25f119\n\nOther economic data\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ijbcwg8de5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b5b95dd92a1f3ba10c05f327b3a60611a418098a\n\n**US business and markets: Another round of style and sector rotation is likely happening.**\n\n\u2022\tS&amp;P 500 meets technical definition of a new bull market, closing above 20% its October low. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have gained for the fourth and seventh straight weeks, respectively.\n\n\u2022\tMoney rotated out of mega caps, with broad-based participation in other areas of the market. Financials, industrials, energy, and consumer discretionary sectors saw gains, while technology and consumer staples sectors declined. Russell 2000 outperformed as the top-performing major index, helped by strong regional bank shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wwunl7dde5b1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=63e25699939d2aa62ca4dad51750ee818f1d9f94\n\n# Stock valuation and predictions\n\n**Valuation**\n\nAnalysts\u2019 estimations:\n\n2023 Full Year EPS: $222 (unchanged last week)\n\nNTM EPS: $232 (up from 230 last week)\n\n2024 Full Year EPS: $247 (unchanged from last week)\n\nCurrent forward PE: 18.5 (down from 18.6 last week), higher than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s53ifb8hde5b1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=39dc6c0ee350b6df85e6c8a73377c45480b3fc24\n\nHeadwinds and Tailwinds based on this week\u2019s data (updated)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47tvujgide5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=906c2e7df13206b58c7e7899a5b8d7a20ed434f2\n\n**My year-end prediction (not changed):**\n\nMy base case (shown in green) has not changed from last week. Assume SP500 earnings of $247 for 2024, with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline by the year end. My year-end SP500 target is between 3920 to 4410 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio. Many banks have raised their year-end target recently. Investor sentiment certainly support a higher PE multiple for now. However, given a lot of headwinds ahead especially short term liquidity drain, possibility of more Fed hikes, and further economic slowdown, I am being a little cautious and not changing my target just yet.\n\nLight blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17.3X), 3980 is a more appropriate level.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwcwpe8vde5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9fd34816ba5a5e396fe16b4fb3119d4aa754670a\n\nI have been talking about the comeback of small caps if the current \"Goldilocks\" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers. And last week\u2019s market performance has shown exactly that. I continue to overweight small and mid-caps, as these stocks are currently trading at attractive valuations and tend to perform well in a slow expansion environment with moderate interest rates (soft-landing narrative). \n\n[Small and mid-caps are very cheap and will do well if \\\\\"soft-landing\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/p0ddf2y2ee5b1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=494cfc84d0e9d882d6050618bb3b1468caf67447)\n\n[Growth is still cheaper than before COVD](https://preview.redd.it/zh8vf2y2ee5b1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=807930a580d2e088b846eaf13e04adb33b7717f3)\n\n[U.S. equity size and style total returns as of 6\\/9\\/23 \\(&amp;#37;\\). Note that small-caps out performed the rest of the market.](https://preview.redd.it/62k9u1y2ee5b1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd3142b0c48b8784f5129fb3d1ab2316033151e0)\n\nI have some QQQ puts and cash. Not holding my positions over the weekend. I may add some back on Monday. Still bullish on small caps (IWM, ZS, BILL, CFLT, MNDY, DDOG, etc), financials (KRE), I also like auto manufacturers (TSLA, F). A lot of suppressed demand just like home builders. Tread carefully. Equities are very extended. Even in a bull market, this is very over bought.",

Current PE multiple is 18.5, whereas 10 yr yield is 3.75%, so risk premium is only 1.65%, among the lowest levels in history. But since it's not negative yet, could it go even lower, absolutely. There is no logic in the market, mostly just sentiments. GS raised their year-end target from 4000 to 4500 overnight, why? is earning expectation really improved that much? not at all, 2023 consensus yearly earnings estimate actually moved down since the beginning of the year and haven't really moved in the past few month. It's all sentiments that supported this bull run so far this year. Earnings estimates? no change;  10 yr-yield? no change; multiples? 16x to 18.5x. What changed? Sentiments (with liquidity to support it).\n\nAnd for next week, CPI might be important but it's only one data point so the impact is limited. I expect 0, that's right, 0 impact from FOMC meeting. JP will not do anything to surprise the market. You are going to see intra day volatility for sure but you won't notice nothing on a weekly chart.",

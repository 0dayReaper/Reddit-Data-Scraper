If it is gradual then it will have a gradual impact.  \n\nIf money is the pressure that keeps the bubble inflated, are they taking enough money out of the market for it to deflate? Probably not.  Most of the market is owned by a small set of players. They set all the prices, basically.\n\nNot sure if this chart is a correlation to how much money there is sloshing around in the markets, but it could be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m03jf4b74v4b1.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=705a0d18648f417d6f841a499fc13a317728f7f3\n\nThe Fed blinked and stopped removing the  free money for the big players.\n\nCan the Treasury Vacuum compete with the Fed money printer (exchange)? \n\nIf the Fed blinks again, go ham. If the fed tightens, maybe that will have an impact in combination with the Treasury Vacuum.\n\n(By the way, I don't know anything about anything.)",

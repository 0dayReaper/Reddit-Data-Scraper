All my spare cash has been put into it. \n\nIt went down 11 percent yesterday. That\u2019s when I learned I was buying Nasdaq the fucking company, not the composite. FML, feel like a belong here now. \n\nAdvice on a path forward would be appreciated, right now my plan is to sell and slowly buy QQQ.",

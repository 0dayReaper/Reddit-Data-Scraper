    "postText": "Space Cowboys. I would like to make you aware that the World's most expensive drug is pending FDA approval, and their deadline to approve is June 30th.\n \nBMRN - Biomarin Pharmaceuticals, the drug is called ROCTAVIAN and it treats Hemophilia A.\n \nHow do we know it will be the most expensive drug in the world?\n \nThe current most expensive drug in the world is Hemgenix, which treats the other form of Hemophilia, Hemophilia B, and is also a Gene Therapy drug (1).\n \nBiomarin also already produces Brineura, the eighth most expensive drug in the world. With Roctavian approval Biomarin will be the only Pharmaceutical company with two drugs in the top 10 most expensive list (2). That smells like profit.\n \nHow do we know if it will be approved?\n \nRoctavian is an 'Orphan\" drug, it treats a rare disease for which no equivalent treatment exists. This gives it priority in the FDA's review process.\n \nLook at the list of Orphan drugs pending FDA decisions this year. Every single one has been approved. EVERY ONE. (3)\n \nRoctavian was already approved in Europe in August (4).\n \nBiomarin submitted additional data from their clinical studies in March. To allow time to review this data, the FDA updated their decision date to June 30th. The data only further reinforces (5) the effectiveness of the drug, and the delay is also why you can get a bargain right now.\n \n \nSource 1:\nhttps://www.benefitspro.com/2022/11/28/fda-approves-worlds-most-expensive-drug-to-treat-hemophilia-at-3-5m-a-dose/\n \nSource 2:\nhttps://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/drug-cost-and-savings/most-expensive-drugs-period\n \nSource 3:\nhttps://checkrare.com/2023-orphan-drugs-pdufa-dates-and-fda-approvals/\n \nSource 4:\nhttps://investors.biomarin.com/2023-03-06-BioMarin-Provides-Update-on-FDA-Review-of-ROCTAVIAN-TM-Valoctocogene-Roxaparvovec-Gene-Therapy-for-Adults-with-Severe-Hemophilia-A\nSource 5:\nhttps://investors.biomarin.com/2023-01-08-BioMarin-Announces-Stable-and-Durable-Annualized-Bleed-Control-for-ROCTAVIAN-TM-in-Largest-Phase-3-Gene-Therapy-Study-in-Adults-with-Severe-Hemophilia-A-134-Participant-Study-Met-All-Primary-and-Secondary-Efficacy-Endpoints-at-3-Year-Analysis\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 TLDR \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nBMRN = \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89   +   \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 =  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nEdit: Position: BMRN JULY 2023 95.00 CALL",

They later moved to using paper receipts for tobacco stored in warehouses. Courts levied fines in pounds of tobacco. There weren't money or banks. It wasn't until 1813 that MD completed the switchover to dollars (from pounds - of tobacco). That tobacco was the subject of much strife, due to it went down in price over time. But it was never worthless. The first notes issued by the US were essentially worthless due to they printed more than the backing gold.\n\nhttp://guide.msa.maryland.gov/pages/viewer.aspx?page=money",

It's a far better form of money than fluorine.\n\nDivisible : True of most elements but not things like pearls or diamonds.\n\nFungible : I don't really know why people list this one. Surely any element is fungible.\n\nPortability : I don't want to be carrying around a bunch of helium in my wallet.\n\nNon toxic : Same for lithium. Or mercury. Although to be fair people didn't know mercury was toxic for a long time.\n\nOnce you take these things into account you'll find you've narrowed down the field considerably, many of the remaining elements are often literally referred to as \"precious metals\".\n\nRare : Pretty important one. Copper has been used as a currency but is generally too plentiful to use. Platinum, palladium and rhodium on the other hand are too rare. There's a bunch of other ones that are even rarer to the point of practically not being available at all. Silver is pretty good on this quality too.\n\nSo there you have it. Gold and silver.\n\nThese reasons are why ancient societies used them as currency. You can literally take *any* other element and go through this list and see why ancient societies didn't select them.\n\nDo these properties make them \"useful\"?\n\nI would say yes.",

We have about 2 trillion in circulation and half of that is foreign currency reserves because they rely on the American dollar to maintain economic legitimacy.\n\nThe issue of inflating costs being hard to pay for is rooted in stagnant wages and pro-corporate regulations, as evident when the oil corpos reaped in record profits while gas prices soared because of artificial scarcity where they refused to drill more and cut oil production rather than accepting drilling rights that Congress had granted them and the slashing of employee benefits ranging from insurance coverage to paid leave to wages themselves for various unskilled and skilled laborers. The whole anti-union, anti-government beliefs also keep America's citizenry from having power in their own government by cynically refusing to vote or run for government positions, lowering union participation rates, and a lack of reform to improve the quality of living, civil rights, and not ensuring a competitive market environment that can resist monopolization",

They ended up with zombie banks and two lost decades.  In Japan, the market bubble was fueled by extensive lending, forced mandatory lending.  When the lending ended, that's when it all collapsed.  So, I'd ask, are we in a simliar situation but instead of lending, the QE is over, then you could make that argument that we'd face a similar outcome.  You could make the argument that the Fed Res has to kill the economy so that the govt can afford the interest payments on the debt, and that with inflation, QE is now impossible so the answer would be some form of austerity plan....  Austerity usually results in GDP contracting at a faster pace than the debt, but make no mistake it will cause a contraction.  Without any new taxes to pay down the debt, I think we'd see the same results.  In the 1930s, in the US, they were trying to keep the value of the dollar within some range of the price of gold, and they didn't print until after 1933 when they confiscated gold.  The argument for the Bull market to continue would be if there's a lot of money on the sidelines that still wants to rush in because they think the QE will continue because it would be the only way to bail out the banks, with some type of print and then swap treasuries to absorb the bank losses scenario.  Another argument would be that all the crypto folks want to cash out and go into stocks because of the AI Hype and real estate has limited upside after all the price run up inthe last two years...  I'd side with the bears, because we have to revert back to the mean at some point but I could totally be wrong under a gamestop runnup on hype scenario or a dollar crash scenario...",

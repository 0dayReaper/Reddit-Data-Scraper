If they can't control the looting and other problems in their stores, than the management should go. \n\n3. It's not like you're buying META (still not a fan of zuck or FB/META) because the CEO is balls deep in an idea that not many want. META regardless of many things, can easily be turned around and send the stock up. See Nov 22 to now for META as an example. Target on the other hand is not an easy turn around. They have many things against them. \n\nLike I said before, I could care less on the backlash. \n\nNot advice, I love eating crayons and I shit in Target parking lots.",

Walmart has same problem but it\u2019s been holding up will in the last month - therefore I call BS on the theft issue \n\nTarget has rocketed from $55 to $260 . Wallstreet cheered on management even though some of the problems they had still exit today . But all of a sudden , Target has bad management , so everyone dumps stock . \n\nTarget is going no where. They still got tons to room to grow\u2026. They could take on Costco and Walmart with its own membership wholesale club or gas station . They could expand international and have footprint all over even though the Canada thing was a disaster.\n\nAnalyst are downgrading the company because they have to put some research notes out there for wallstreet to think they are doing their jobs . Most of their analysis are complete  BS, and all come down to this , upgrade a stock when it\u2019s moving higher , downgrade a stock when it goes Lower \n\nBuy Target with confidence . The closest store in my neighborhood is always packed . THIS TOO SHALL PASS .  \n\n$200 buy DECEMBER 2023",

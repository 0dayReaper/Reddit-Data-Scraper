Unfortunately he's still an ape and wipes his ass with his fingers, and chooses to do so by purchasing a tranche of put options far OTM that expire in a week. The orangutan, being the most cunning of all the primates, sees the same opportunity with less greedy eyes and decides to short shares with a sell order at +25% and a stop loss at -10%\n\nTo which ape belongs the spoils is not yet clear, but it is quite fascinating to watch them at contest. Some will go home to banana free caves, some will be left with no cave at all. But for some, they will be as the gorillas say, or sign in the case of Koko the Gorilla, who quotes it \"Ballin' like Donkey Kong\"",

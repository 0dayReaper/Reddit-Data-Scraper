    "postText": " \n\nI am considering this risky trade on MSTR which has an unhealthy relationship with BTC\n\nIts risky because if the price of BTC or MSTR go down then I would have to exit this strategy asap\n\nSynthetic + 1 25/12/19 240C MSTR + -2 25/12/19 240P\n\nto give $5650 credit - this pays off as long as MSTR stays above $211\n\nOther combinations generate different payoffs for instance selling 2x 280P and buying a 120C gives a similar credit but max loss is increased etc.\n\nAnybody have anything to add to this?",

The day we reach the wall where people cannot keep amassing debt and paying it off is when shit drops.\n\nI do believe we are much better suited now than in 1929 to prevent such a catastrophic fall, but it\u2019s inevitable. When most people\u2019s fortunes are tied to the common man\u2019s debt to them, the day they can\u2019t pay back is a tough day. It\u2019s why weirdly enough the student loan relief would be good in the long run, although some investors will mainly get their principle amount and some interest they were hoping for multiples of their principle amount. But that kind of move would be yet another bandaid to keep this party going",

The peak was December 2021, so we are about 15-16 months into the downturn.\n\nThis entire bear market was super textbook. The only unusual part was bonds falling also as bonds tend to be inversely correlated with stocks.",

Scared money pulled out of the market during the last dip, and they need a crash to prove themselves right. They've been getting hosed by inflation on their cash, and they need to feel justified about all the money they lost.",

Now people understand what the reason is for the recession and the probable upcoming crisis, hopefully they will know how to react (although i doubt it as our economy is not meant for stability so crisis are inevitable).",

It's as volatile as ever, if not more so. \n\nTo claim a few newer theories and sensors in the market makes us recession-proof is the sort of arrogance that had people in 1909 proclaiming they'd built an unsinkable ship.",

Was that I'd seen all these houses built 1900-1920s, where a lot of them were 3 bedroom colonials, some 4 with granite counters...   And granite was expensive and uncommon through the 70s and 80s...  and then people started borrowing big at low interest and putting granite in new homes in the 2000s...   Kind of like a Dejavu thing.  Sure enough, loose lending, huge run up, and we had a housing crash...  So, on the stock market thing, 1920s, people buying stocks on leverage 10 to 1...  Today we have folks thinking they'll get rich on Robin Hood doing options trading, check.  Over inflated Asset prices, check.  The difference, I'd argue, is that instead of the devaluation of the dollar and printing occuring in the 1933 and after, we've already done that in the earlier stage.  So, some of that rise in the stock market is based on the dollar dropping what, 20% in value maybe...  So, I don't think we'd crash to the line you've got there because the dollars are not valued the same.  It's almost like in the 29, we did the big crash, the austerity, and then the printing.  This time we did the crash, the printing, and now we're going to do the austerity.  Same stuff just in a different order.  50% crash, I think that's totally valid.  70% crash or more, I don't think we'll get there because we've already devalutated the dollars, and the last 2 years of inflation, which hides the losses.  (In 2008, 9, 10 we were hiding RE losses in QE...  Maybe what you lost on your home was 20% but in real dollar terms, it was like 35% probably.)",

So there should be record amounts of reduced spending in the future. Couple that with student loan payments picking back up.  Sales of Rv\u2019s are down 50%.  Tons of things likes boats, atv\u2019s, etc are flooding the secondary market as people try to square their budgets.  Housing sales are terrible and that drives several other industries like furniture and remodeling.  \n\nThere are so many worrying signs out there.  My prediction is that many businesses that tend to pull the majority of their profits during summer will not hit their goals over the next month or so and that will hurt profitability and lead to job losses.  All of that hurts GDP.  I doubt things crash to the level that OP suggests, but I do agree that the next leg will be down.",

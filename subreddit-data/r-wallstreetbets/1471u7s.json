    "postText": "Charles Schwab will be disclosing its next liquidity update next month on a Tuesday.  Investors will be looking into whether core assets have increased or not. If the new core assets brought into Charles Schwab during May is less than the total amount of deposits that left the US banking system for the week of 07/05 - 07/09, the stock will sell off just as usual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf Charles Schwab brings in about 40-47 billion dollars in new capital similar to February, I expect the stock to rally, even if this number is below the amount of deposits gained within the US banking system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharles Schwab is a full service broker with Chase Bank as an agent for deposits/clearing. It is expected to completely absorb T.D. Ameritrade by Labor Day.",

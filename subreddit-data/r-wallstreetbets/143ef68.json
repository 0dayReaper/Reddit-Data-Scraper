I've had a hard time finding good info on how the Platform revenue breaks down but there is info indicating that a significant portion of that revenue comes from the 20% cut of subscription revenue and 30% cut of ad revenue that Roku takes from streaming providers for the privilege of being on the platform. The exact numbers are opaque and I think that's intentional because it represents significant strategic risk. They may have a significant dependence on other content providers paying them which is only in those provider's best interests as long as Roku can hang on to the leverage it has from its platform's market penetration. Content providers are giving up strategic advantage by putting themselves on a neutral platform. If Roku's leverage gives way that huge revenue stream could be at risk of evaporating. They don't have the clout to compete with major content producers and my guess is the big players would love to outmaneuver Roku and recapture the subscription and ad revenue. \n\nWould love to hear other opinions or counterpoints and if anyone knows of references that shed light on the breakdown of that platform revenue it would be interesting.",

Even if interest rate is not higher than inflation a higher interest rate still makes a lot of leveraged plays unattractive. \n\nIn the end they need to be careful and give banks some time to adjust I guess. A big bank going bellyup because their assets lose too much value would be the worst thing. \n\nhttps://uk.investing.com/economic-calendar/core-cpi-736",

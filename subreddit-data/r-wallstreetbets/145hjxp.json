See: today). After that, yeah... once the initial boost and profit-taking happened, the price action changed to finding VWAP and then landing near 430/VWAP for options expiration.\n\nIt's a common pattern.",

            "comment": "&gt;There could be a few reasons for this. First, it's possible that people are selling in the afternoon to take profits before the market closes. Second, it could be that more bad news comes out in the afternoon and people start selling off their positions. Finally, it could simply be that the market is more volatile in the afternoon and thus more prone to swings up or down.",

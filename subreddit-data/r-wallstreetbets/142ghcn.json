It most certainly does.\n\nPsychedelics by contrast are uplifting, enhancing and occasionally revelatory (creating epiphanies that can be remembered after).  As substances go easily had my best experiences on them.\n\nEven a certain Mr. S. Jobs claimed LSD was one of the formative experiences of his life.\n\nMinor cautionary experience is I did meet some 'psychonaughts' on my travels that seemingly had taken LSD (in particular) perhaps too far - such that they were despondent without it, almost indifferent to reality outside of it and certainly of a less fun character; until they were back on it (or something).  As a collective they seemed to struggle without it and seemed to feed each others need.\n\nAll things should be taken with some moderation.\n\nGlad to hear it makes you feel awesome too!  \n\nHopefully some decent studies can be performed on it so we can all take it safely and reap the benefits we seem to feel (outside of any 'proper' studies..)",

I have never been into psychedelic benders, since I'm also terrified of people I've met; that more or less lost the plot on psychedelics.

The next step after that is crazy homeless person. \n\n Idk when it happens but if it happens to me I'll know why, so I tend to chill out. Life does get weird right after a trip and I worry that my brain might decide to take the wrong shortcuts from the default mode network, if it's too used to being on shrooms/acid, and taking those shortcuts. Psychedelics are great for concept level thinking, but garbage when you just need to clean/do some menial shit.",

I had the most body highs from mushrooms but you feel terrible afterwards, never more than visual distortions. I had the most head changes with Acid with a sort of welcomed confusion where everything just seemed like I was seeing it for the first time. Lots of flowing trees, everything felt warm, riding in a cart was sublime. But I had the most intense visuals by far with Mescaline. I watched Planet Earth pour out of the TV and Disney Land emerged from what appeared to be a World War 2 battlefield. Those trips were pretty wild, but I never lost myself. I always knew I was watching something play out and it wasn't real and it would end at some point. And considering the doses I took I can't even imagine what would be required in order to visit other places and see things that just don't exist in the real world.",

NOTHING like DMT. \nIt's not like shrooms are a 6 and Dmt is a 10... It's not like shrooms are a grape and DMT is a mango. \n\nA more accurate comparison would be shrooms are a headier, empathic, peaceful version of being drunk with some cool visuals... and DMT is being shot into another dimension that you could not possibly ever imagine, not if I wrote 100 books trying to explain it to you. You could be anywhere, you could see anything, and it would all seem real. You could BE anything, including an inanimate object with no sense of, or memory of, every being human. This is the true meaning of ego death,  which you don't truly understand until you experience it. It has nothing to do with self importance, which is what many seem to think it means. \nNot to say the experience can't be very humbling. It definitely can be especially if you're shown many of your demons, the bad shit you did to others, failures in life, or worse if you literally thought you were dying... faced with your perceived final moments, your regrets, what you wish you had said or not said to someone the last time you saw them, or how your body will be found and by whom...\n\nRight now you might be thinking it sounds a dream, and it's hard to resist the urge say \"it's like a dream but\", because we're talking about *closed eye visuals* here but really, it's further away from a dream, even, than a shroom trip because at least with a shroom trip you have a fairly regular sense of \"self\" like you do in a typical dream state. But a DMT experience isn't a larger number, or a more exotic fruit, or like trying to imagine an alien species 37 million million light years away. It's nothing like one could imagine, any more than I could begin to describe it to you. And one day, may you be unreligiously blessed in the final moments of your life, that your brain be flooded with the endogenous DMT that's inside your brain *right now* and you get to experience it yourself. \n\nThe only shame in this, is that for almost everyone, this will be their one and only. And so much can be done *afterward* with the self-examination and insight that can be had. I think about this all the time, for the better.",

This is an insane leap of tech and 4 times the pixels as the Quest Pro\n* Crazy amount of sensors and cameras, lagless passthrough\n* No controllers needed unlike VR headsets. All interactions done via hands and eyes.\n* It'll scan your face and create a 1:1 virtual avatar for video calls and meetings. I don't think any headset in the market does this right now.\n\nComparing Vision Pro/Hololens/Magic Leap to Quest/Oculus/Index is comparing apples to oranges. Is the former worth $3500? Not to me, personally. But it's disingenuous and ignorant to blame Apple for the high price when Microsoft released theirs 6 years ago at $3000.",

I\u2019m waiting to see what happens when a celebrity starts wearing this thing in public. The millisecond Kim Kardashian or Drake puts one on is it still a stupid idea to the audience? And I don\u2019t hear any legitimate criticisms about it so far other than the price of the headset and the fact that other (equally expensive) headsets exist in the market (which do almost none of the things this new Apple headset will do - or at least their marketing is hot garbage if they do because nobody knows about them). We\u2019re going to hear a lot of criticisms but the fact still remains that there\u2019s no consumer friendly product like this available so far in the market that actually makes AR seem like a real life possibility in your day to day.",

But totally agreed, this is a truly new fancy gadget that comes with the \u201ccool\u201d Apple label that rich people can flex on all the poors with. Then just as consumers get rabid, they drop the normal tier headset for like $2000-$2500 and probably the SE for like $1750. Hottest tech item of the year, back orders for months. And don\u2019t even get me started on all the accessories and potential color options lol.",

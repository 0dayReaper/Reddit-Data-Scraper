    "postText": "If you didn't know why nasdaq stock fell of yesterday here's the summary:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ:NDAQ) was met with a severe blow as the market opened today, with its shares plunging a staggering 10% in response to the company's recent announcement of a groundbreaking $10.5 billion acquisition deal with software investment firm Adenza. The market's reaction to Nasdaq's largest-ever acquisition sent shockwaves through the industry, causing widespread selling pressure and rattling investor confidence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The substantial decline resulted in NDAQ shares opening significantly lower, trading just above their year-to-date lows of approximately $52, a level reminiscent of the mid-March slump. Despite a modest recovery of 10% over the past three months from those lows, Nasdaq's stock encountered formidable resistance at its 160-day moving average, preventing any sustained upward momentum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Despite the downward pressure, short-term options traders have demonstrated a prevailing call-bias, as indicated by NDAQ's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.46. This ratio, lower than 95% of readings from the past year, suggests that traders hold bullish expectations, anticipating a possible recovery in the stock's price in the near future.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The market's reaction to Nasdaq's sharp decline has led to a compelling situation for options traders. Options on NDAQ are currently priced relatively affordably, with NDAQ's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) reading at 19%, placing it in the very low 3rd percentile compared to readings from the past 12 months. This low SVI implies that options traders are factoring in lower-than-expected levels of volatility, indicating a perceived stability in the stock's future performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nasdaq Stock (NDAQ) Plunges After Adenza Acquisiton News.](https://www.stockera.xyz/post/nasdaq-stock-ndaq-plunges-after-adenza-acquisiton-news)",

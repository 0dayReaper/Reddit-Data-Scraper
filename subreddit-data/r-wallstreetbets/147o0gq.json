    "postText": "I saw a post the other day about some analyst saying now is a prime time for Apple to acquire DIS. While I know that Apple completely acquiring DIS is out of the question, but the launch of the vision pro gives apple a huge opportunity in the entertainment sector. I can see a huge upside for both companies if Apple and Disney reach some sort of deal with Disney\u2019s media portfolio and Apple TV+ to leverage the new headset. Since Disney is so down bad, I think it would make sense for Disney to be champing at the bit to enter some sort of symbiotic deal with Apple. Thoughts?",

Are you asking if AAPL should acquire a portion of Disney, or are you asking if AAPL should enter into a partnership with Disney?\n\nThe former is probably a hard no.  Disney believes their media portfolio feeds into their parks, cruises, and merchandises.  I don't think DIS would sell any part of their portfolio.\n\nThe latter is maybe possible.  Though I don't think people will buy a $3,500 VR headset to watch The Little Mermaid.  AAPL or DIS will need to invest in the technology to profit from it.",

Imo they are probably a reasonable play long term, they are slowly making there server chips more competitive to amd, and they are basically getting money from the U.S. government to build out there chip manufacturing business, which they have experience in, but are moving have other companies to build with them. They already do build AI stuff into some of there products, so it\u2019s not like they really are entering net new there either. Unless they show something net new for AI stuff I doubt it\u2019s enough to have them bump the same way the other two are.\n\nImo I also don\u2019t have a huge level of confidence in amd being able to take a huge percentage of that market either compared to nvidia, who has been growing this for years. But they are small enough where it could be a large bump if enough companies desire to go with them.",

Their data sheets are awesome , and they are integrated into every EE program / college in the United States so students  learn how to use their parts from the ground up. They were the first ones that I knew of that had a machine learning product , and the support was great.  I can\u2019t believe how cheap the stock is right now - but I like the company and have 1,000 shares as part of my approach toward investing .  They are a great company and are in an excellent position  .",

They are 8 years behind everyone else who has already been using asml tech as they still aren't using it for manufacturing. They were really arrogant about switching to it, which is why they are behind.\n\nIntel doesn't compete directly with nvidia, Arm, risc-v they make different tech. They dont make reduced instruction set chips or gpus (well, they just started gpus, and they have been a failure, but thats a different story for another day). The only competitors they have in sales are AMD in their cpu unit and xilinx in their fpga segment. But in terms of lithography tech, their main competitor is asml. Tsmc is a foundry competitor, but their main competitive advantage is using asml tech.\n\nJust to illustrate this with apple, who used tsmc to build their m1 chips. The m1 chip came out in 2020 at 5nm. In 2020, intel was primarily fabbing 13nm chips. They are getting smoked. They had 10 nm chips out, but they were struggling with getting quality bins and had to reduce capacity expectations. Then they did the rebranding of 13nm tech to intel 10 and 10nm to intel 7. They messed so bad that they basically had to lie about where they were to save face. That's not a power move. That's a move of desparation.",

They only recently, in the last two years, started using asml for ulv. Otherwise why would they be stuck at 13nm and 10nm for 7+ years while the rest of the industry advanced? You're not making any sense and you're getting upset because you're wrong. \n\nIntel is certainly not competing head to head with nvidia in any segment. Intels gpus are considered a joke. Nvidia competes with AMD. Intel is not viewed as a competitor in the gpu space. They have a product, but it is not competitive with either amd or nvidia. \n\nIntel makes cisc not risc. Arm risc-v and even apples m1s are all risc chips. Apple might pretend they are equivalent, but they are not. X86 is not the type of chip they are. X86 is 32bit architecture. You are confusing all these terms together. The contemporarily used architecture is now 64bit. 64 bit architecture can be used to decipher 32 bit but not 16-bit systems like dos which is why x86 hung around for as long as it did as it bridged the 70s 80s and 90s to 21st century.\n\nTheir main cpu competitor is amd in terms of servers and retail cpus. Amd makes cisc as well as intel. Amd makes much better gpus than intel, and i still wouldn't call intel a competitor.\n\nI can tell you can't even comprehend what an fpga is as you made no arguments there and avoided talking about it altogether. \n\nBut yea I guess I'll just keep \"smoking meth\" while you keep holding on to intel as it slowly loses market share to AMD. Fucking degenerates in here.",

They only recently, in the last two years, started using asml for ulv.\n\nlolwut?  intel's been buying euv from asml since asml first made euv machines (and pretty much shelved them, deciding to focus on duv, instead.  like regards).  and intel was buying duv from them before that.\n\nffs, intel used to have stake in asml.\n\n\n&gt;Otherwise why would they be stuck at 13nm and 10nm for 7+ years while the rest of the industry advanced?\n\nbecause they decided to blow ~$100B in buybacks instead of buying more euv that their fabs desperately needed.  eg, terrible management.\n\n&gt;Intel is certainly not competing head to head with nvidia in any segment\n\nare you actually this stupid?  they're competing with nvidia DIRECTLY in gpu, cpu, and accelerators.  \n\n&gt;Intel makes cisc not risc.\n\nwhen did i ever say intel made risc?  oh, right.  never.\n\n&gt;You are confusing all these terms together. \n\nthe irony is fucking palpable.  you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, and yet you have such a haughty attitude.\n\n&gt;I can tell you can't even comprehend what an fpga is as you made no arguments there and avoided talking about it altogether. \n\nlolwut?  why the fuck would i bother to talk about fpgas?  they're not relevant to this.  and intel's suck compared to xilinx/amd, anyway.  derp.\n\n&gt;But yea I guess I'll just keep \"smoking meth\" while you keep holding on to intel \n\nholy shit, you think i have intel?  you HAVE been smoking meth!\n\n'hurr durr, intel's competitor is asml, who has a monopoly and zero competitors... and intel as a customer!'",

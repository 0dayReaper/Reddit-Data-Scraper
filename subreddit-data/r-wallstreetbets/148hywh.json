Shiiiid hoping for a top and consolidation so I can close those positions and not sell my shares. \n\nWhat do you regards think about the eVTOL market?\n\nI\u2019m heavy in $JOBY, have some $ACHR as well. \n\nI\u2019m also getting into some sUAS stonks like :those who shall not be named: in hopes that a domestic market will come to fruit with the proposed bans on DJI and Autel. \n\nThots?\n\n*Edited out some tickers that visual mod didn\u2019t like.",

Theres a lot of institutional and government interest in this stock that will keep the price at least at a plateau if we go into recession.",

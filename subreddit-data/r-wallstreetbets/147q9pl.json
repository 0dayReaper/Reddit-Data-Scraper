    "postText": "I\u2019m surprised by the lack of speculation on here regarding the absolutely mind blowing UAP disclosure going on. What are your thoughts regarding the best stocks in light of upcoming disclosure? After seeing the Benziga article along with a few other ideas, here are my thoughts: \n\nSPCE (Virgin Galactic) - commercial space travel \n\nMMAT (Meta Marerials) - synthetic alloy and nanotechnology that would be important for developing exotic spacecraft \n\nUFO ETF - sampling of aerospace/defense, satellite, others\n\nPLTR (Palantir) - AI systems will be integral to the upcoming revelations we are about to experience, and they are already have DoD and aerospace companies as major customers\n\nThoughts???\n\nEdit: OK, not the most thoughtful feedback. I\u2019ll talk to you guys in about 6 months when independent thinking is no longer required to believe there is likely merit to many of the claims being made. All the best.\n\nSomeone asked for the link:[Benzinga article](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/23/06/32742621/bombshell-whistleblower-testimony-suggests-virgin-galactic-is-wildly-undervalued)\n\n\nHere\u2019s another fun one: [Chris Mellon was the deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence, for all you smooth brains.](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/06/03/ufo-crash-materials-intelligence-00100077)",

Just because someone is a pilot or holds some special position doesn't make them right. The David Fraver thing is a great example, nothing he claimed in his interviews is backed up by the released video from his encounter.",

    "postText": "I just read a report that Goldman Sachs is predicting 300 millions jobs lost or degraded by AI. In my opinion, we will see nowhere near this number of jobs lost (if at all). It\u2019s amazing how over speculated the tech industry is now. NVDA rallying 20% just because they mention AI in their earnings call? AI is a giant marketing fad. Wall Street has become obsessed over its perceived exponential growth which will soon grind to a halt. You can only scale a model so much before you start to see diminishing returns. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has even stated that this is a huge problem and why a GPT 5 isn\u2019t being worked on at the moment. These LLMs also steal data and tend to hallucinate constantly. This has been seen with it making up the random case law a lawyer tried to use. Good luck putting this into any business that values risk management. Once this is regulated and things come back down to Earth the business world is in for a huge awakening because tech is no where near as profitable and revolutionary as many of these companies still claim to be. Look at Tesla\u2019s \u201cself driving\u201d being a complete failure in actually delivering what was promised. It\u2019s recent leaks show insult to injury with its thousands of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d complaints. There have been no notable advancements since 2017 in AI (with the Vaswani et al paper), but these companies and singularity loving redditors would love for you to believe so. This type of \u201cAI\u201d is nothing but a trend, and an arguably unethical one at that. It has the potential to boost productivity substantially, but it\u2019s as close to replacing white collar workers as robots are to replacing blue collar ones due to its lack of high level reasoning. True general intelligence to replace workers advances incrementally which is still up for debate if it can even be done at all.\n\nTLDR: Puts on tech",

You can check them yourself. I don't appreciate your tone and am ending this conversation here.\"\n\nSo yeah, AI bots are not necessarily good at \"recognizing\" mistakes, in large part because they don't actually _know_ anything.",

Think about it; it will assume the following step in any chain of events happened because it is trained to think causally about things, but in reality the events may not have happened at all (yet)\n\nI am skeptical the lower hallucinations from GPT3 to 4 are due to any improvement in architecture. I think they just trained it on much more stuff. My go-to example is that ChatGPT3 hallucinated about the Iliad a lot, and was not able to quote from it, while ChatGPT4 gets right most basic questions about the Iliad a lot...but it is also able to quote from it. Which means, they just fed it the damn thing so it could stop hallucinating that the Trojan horse was in the Iliad",

We evaluate whether or not the data we received conflict with other data we have and which is most likely to be reliable.  A general intelligence would likely also do this, and the robot in iRobot also may.  These LLMs make no attempt at having such a model and the 2nd level models they are putting on top also do not model this process but rely on human feedback to do it for them.  Hence, these models have no consistent model or the world or concept of permanence, nor even any semblance of logical consistency in their output in even a single session.  \n\nBy the way, monkeys do it roughly how humans do and it is not a statistically highest likelihood series of words.  Perhaps you're confused by the monkey typewriter analogy where they randomly write Shakespeare but 1) monkeys don't speak English (and mostly don't understand it with some border cases) so we aren't in the same domain as their thought processes and 2) the premise is that those words are at random due to that lack of understanding, not the highest likelihood words.",

Smaller more efficient models are absolutely usable with substantially less parameters (and thereby cheaper to run).. yes chatgpt can write you a Wendy's job application in the voice of a pirate, but that's also a lot of unnecessary \"knowledge\" to pay for. Check out 4bit quantization as an example. We have methods to be more pragmatic in usage. \n\nThe real revelation is (at least to my dumbass self) that we don't need LLMs to contain all the knowledge to answer questions. We need it to have enough sophistication to showcase the emergent phenomenon of chain of thought reasoning.  What does this mean? It means we can write code and work with LLMs to solve problems in multiple steps. How is it this different from programming something normally? Check out the YouTube chatwithdata to see an example looking at a Tesla10k.\n\n Artificial general intelligence doesn't exist, but using technology such as langchain, retrieval augmented generation, and others we can essentially stimulate to a user something that feels like AGI.  Many use cases are being overhyped, but it will work in many simple but highly manual processes that RPA and other automation tech failed to deliver on.",

Then the programmer will most likely use AI to help create the code, but will still need to test and debug the software.

AI will help software become even more prolific.

They've managed to create a few workarounds, the most popular of which is to use Stable Diffusion to guide the process manually.\n\nThe problem with hands in art is typical of AI right now, like the problem with holding a conversation in Chat GPT.  AI doesn't \\*understand\\* yet.  It doesn't understand what a hand is.  It doesn't understand or relate to abstract ideas and feelings, having a past, worrying about the future, pain, etc.  It doesn't experience beauty when it \"hears\" or analyzes Mozart.  It's still at the pattern recognition and emulation stage.  It needs criteria fed by humans.  It has no sense of culture.\n\nSo I stand by my original statement.  AI art is interesting and it can be pretty convincing, but AI is (thankfully) no Skynet.",

No company has ever wanted to say they have a monopoly on anything so by saying they have no moat, and are scared of open source software--which is of course controlled by no one--they remove the burden on themselves. Google's moat comes from decades of data they have from their search engine which they can train their models on. I'm not sure if open source AI has access to that data.",

Last time, I checked with their team, the bill was reduced to $300/month. \nSix years ago, at another startup, we published a podcast and we had a junior marketing guy who handled the audio files, upload it to all the platforms, create snippets for promotional purposes and handle the SEO for the podcast, it was pretty much his full time job. Now, you pay $50/month to a podcast platform and it does all that job and the junior marketing guys only spends a couple hours once every week promoting podcasts to increase the audience. This startup now has 3 podcasts. \nSo, I can tell you things are moving and who knows whats coming in the next five years.",

You know how many people put their minds together to analyze data and create micro services for management, sales reps and the like. There\u2019s plenty of other use such as in-house training courses, AI assistants to new hires and seniors. Basically fuck searching through 10 000 pages of knowledge-bases and courses. AI can standardize, it can correct and it can easily apply corporate governance. It can analyze performance based on metric data from Microsoft Viva, phone calls and sales etc. I guess my point is the data is already accessible and some poor soul probably goes through this shit on monthly reports showing KPI\u2019s and sales performances etc.. but why not have one corporate AI that just swings this all the time and constantly keep track, give feedback, proposals etc. \n\nThen I think there will be companies manufacturing employee AI\u2019s, basically training them for a specific role, could be a nurse, could be an IT operations person, could be a support agent, or any type of service job really. Now incorporate a bit of PAM &amp; IAM for regulation purposes and to give the AI ways of executing tasks. It has the knowledge, it has the access to a variety of commands it can execute, it has the possibility to have a dialogue and troubleshoot, why wouldn\u2019t it work? These little humanlike service AI\u2019s will then be sold to companies, managed, trained and improved by its original makers. \n\nAI is also going to become a part of people\u2019s everyday life\u2019s, like it or not with smart homes, alarm systems, personal assistants.. you either get tech savvy or get left behind. You have google assistant making phone calls and booking appointments for you with a human like voice already, do you really think this isn\u2019t going to happen?",

The only reason you don\u2019t understand exponential growth is because you only see your all time losses on your portfolio. \n\nAI is as ground breaking as the start of the internet. If you invested in Amazon or Apple at the start you would be a multimillionaire by now. \n\nThis is that opp and you\u2019re fucking it up.",

They rallied 20% because they guided back breaking earnings for next quarter. You could now do the math and calculate PE and such by extrapolating the guided earnings but that's understandably really hard if you can't understand math.",

AI is just going to be like dot com bubble, once Wall St stops being hype about it is when it will actually become important, just goes to show how short term Wall St is. Anyone patient and smart like Warren Buffet knows that AI is going to get big in a few years from now, and it's not going to be with ChatGPT type AI that can generate silly photos of people smoking Zaza and fake photos of the Pentagon blowing up. It costs $0.20/response for ChatGPT to run, plus the cost of improving the AI and they currently don't even have a good way of monetizing it, even ads would only help slightly.",

I don't doubt you, I just think that Wall Street is going to get too impatient because they think that a technology that has been steadily improving behind the scenes is suddenly going to change all of humanity within a couple of months. I think AI has insane potential, but it'll be at least a couple years before we really get more out of it. AI has already been important in many things, but it's not until now that Wall Street has gotten obsessed over it with ChatGPT, which isn't really the best application of AI in my mind. I think this bubble will burst like the dot com bubble, and then when Wall Street takes their eyes off AI again then it'll keep chugging along and change our world like the internet. Things don't change society over night, even the craziest technologies need time. This definitely won't take decades, but there are still years of work to fully realize the potential of AI in business.",

Continue holding safe-haven stocks,  hold back on options, and hold some bonds, until we start seeing very large drops in, say, Apple or Berkshire or Spy. Then I start to start analyzing what kind of state we\u2019re in. Otherwise, it\u2019s simply fear-mongering. \n\nWhy bullish? Consider the case where the stock market starts going down. Then we\u2019d have an insane amount of put option premiums go up. Clearly it\u2019s smart money selling these puts. So until the numbers show that people are *actually* bullish, it isn\u2019t worth considering the bear case.",

    "postText": "I can take a $60,000 loan out from Sofi for a 17% interest rate. The monthly payment for a 5 year term is around $1,400. The monthly dividends from TSLY would be $3,300. Use that to service the debt then either use the rest to diversify in to something like RIV or XYLD. From there the principal will grow providing more dividends. I could either keep the loan or start paying off faster. Is it that simple? \ud83d\ude02",

I\u2019m expecting a downturn within the next year before we hit another long bill run.

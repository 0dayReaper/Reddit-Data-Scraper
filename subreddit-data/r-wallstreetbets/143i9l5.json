Since the strike price was $61, those calls were almost worthless with only two days expiration left. So of course, when they turned in the money, huge profit. Don't listen to the other guy who said \"Time decay\", with time decay the contracts would actually decrease in value, not increase.",

A $400 contract sold for $1k, new contracts totaling $1k sold for $6.7k, and so on.  It's basically winning consecutive coin tosses and doubling down every time.

This comes out to $100 for the position. Delta is used to analyze the shift in price of the contract related to the underlying security. If an option has a delta of .5, then for every dollar the stock goes up the value of the options contract goes up 50 cents. Now let\u2019s say the price of the stock went up 10 dollars. This would mean that your options contract went up 5 dollars for a total of 6 x 100. When you sell, it is now 600 not 100. There are other factors to the value of options which you should learn, but this is why options contracts can make so much. I bought 5 puts on AAP shortly before the price dump for 1.90 per contract. The price plummeted like $30 per share and resulted in my options being worth 33.5 at the time. This resulted in a trade that could have made $16750 off a $950 starting price. I sold out well before that price but there\u2019s an example of the potential of options. Maybe this is too much info, but I thought someone could use it at least.",

    "postText": "The Florida Supreme Court has agreed to give the state attorney general two additional weeks to submit a brief detailing her argument that a proposed marijuana legalization initiative should be kept off the 2024 ballot.\n\nThe initial briefs were initially due by Monday, but the court approved an uncontested motion to push that deadline back to June 26 because Attorney General Ashley Moody\u2019s (R) office said that it \u201chas multiple pressing deadlines with limited staff assistance\u201d that is preventing the argument from being completed on time.\n\nAttorneys for the cannabis legalization campaign did not object to the deadline extension, and the court granted it on Tuesday\u2014but not without warning Moody against seeking continual delays.\n\n\u201cMultiple extensions of time for the same filing are discouraged,\u201d the court said in its order. \u201cAbsent extenuating circumstances, subsequent requests may be denied.\u201d",

This is a classic tactic of those who are against progress and reform, and it's disappointing to see Ashley Moody engaging in it.",

They have no trading plan,no rules for themselves,they Yolo the majority of their account on a trade when they don't even have any type of thesis as to why they're taking that trade.\n\nThis shit does not happen to people that build a trading plan,stick to it,stick to proper sizing and have conviction in their trades because they've done their TA and put themselves into strong probability trades.\n\nThe rest just gamble and say \"99% of traders lose\" or \"don't trade options,you'll only lose\" \nYet hoards of people do it successfully every day.....\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

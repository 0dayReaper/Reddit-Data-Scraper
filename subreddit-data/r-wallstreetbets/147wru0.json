    "postText": "Well that was one of the most mind boggling days SPY has had in a while\u2026 to not only at time watch SPY move against VOLD (the up and down of NYSE) but to also move against VIX is just absolutely mind numbing\u2026 This market makes less and less sense every day\u2026\n\nHere is some interesting fact I learned over the weekend about the market\u2026\n\n**What happens when we pause?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u96ztj7kcn5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3944439538f0171c507eb976b3554466e074a472\n\nMeaning that IF we pause on Wednesday for FOMC either way over the next year+ we should expect a drop\u2026 Realistically looking at the fed funds target rate trend we are much more similar to 2006 then 2000 or 1994 due to how fast the rate went up and the amount of hikes that occurred\u2026 meaning our highest probability is that the peak will be the pause\u2026 but again that assumes a sensible market\u2026\n\n**SPY TREND**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpbxx9nkcn5b1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5da88de73f4a18c72d86113d49b9a9bd745675af\n\nThis is currently (now 6 days) of being 2+ standard deviations above the 50dma\u2026 I don\u2019t see how long its been since this has happened but since 2021 this is the longest SPY has been above it\u2026 \n\n**CPI**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/saa2kc1lcn5b1.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=44a47bec9d23f59005ea1f8133badb28812536de\n\nActually this is completely mind boggling to me here\u2026 the fact that we are having some of the highest inflation since the 1980s\u2026 yet it has some miracle come down faster than it went up\u2026 \n\nNow this is where I am going to make a big caveat\u2026 and that would be that according to trend (and possible 4% CPI YoY tomorrow) this is saying that CPI is back to where it was around May of 2021\u2026 however, for anyone who has ever been to a grocery story, filled a car up with fuel or looked at housing/ vehicles its very clear that we are NO WHERE near that feel\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfy6acilcn5b1.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=96259b1bc79d268f9c62960d73dd678192d5d704\n\nI was not able to get CPI Bloomberg numbers this time but most of the big hedges are looking for 4%...\n\nHere is my prediction and then here is what I expect markets to do\u2026 \n\nCPI YoY= 3.9-4.1%  \n CPI MoM= 0-0.2%  \n CORE YoY= 5.1-5.3%  \n CORE MoM= 0.3-0.5%\n\nIn my opinion here is how the markets are going to react\u2026 \n\n3.9% or lower CPI YoY and markets likely will see a 1%+ day  \n 4% or higher CPI YoY and we likely see a 0.5% +/- day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0n130iwlcn5b1.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fce89857bcba176f09f7d24d85b6be989d9673c5\n\nHere is how the last few CPI days have opened and closed\u2026 \n\nOf course that brings us into CPI on Wednesday\u2026 there are a few REALLY interesting things about this FOMC\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ck3k2cmcn5b1.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=483224785d29c113082fb5ce2e77b97f52724656\n\nWhat really is odd is that the fed whisperer Nick has not released any sort of concrete response yet to what the fed might do\u2026 everything is very crypted and inconclusive\u2026 that is unlike most FOMCs\u2026\n\nPersonally I think JPOW is going to still do a 25bps hike on Wednesday\u2026 I think people are far too focused on CPI versus CORE CPI\u2026. That CORE YoY and MoM hasn\u2019t budged off 5.5% and 0.4% for quite a long time. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kphobxtmcn5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ad9575c02b141126b8b55e18de466065addce344\n\nI am going to keep this brief as CPI will move us and FOMC\u2026 we will see where the dust settles\u2026\n\nBut today actually is incredibly bullish on the daily\u2026 why? Because we actually turned the 429.68 supply from the August 16th top into a demand (support) today\u2026 that means now 430 is actually considered supported and \u201cjustified.\u201d\n\nTo keep it simple upside target is 437.87 demand and downside target would be new 429.86 demand. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4jadpbncn5b1.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=50237eb6eef42ffaf8cce79174330407a65ca9d0\n\nWe remain in this black bull channel which gives us an upside target of 438.1 tomorrow (support from April 21 2022) and then in the case of a drop 429.8 is not considered strong support. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 429.13 -&gt; 445.34  \n Demand- 429.86 -&gt; 437.87  \n Support- 430.9 -&gt; 429.8 -&gt; 429.2  \n Resistance- 433.91 -&gt; 435.7 -&gt; 438\n\n**FUTURES**\n\nNote- TOS rolled its contract over the weekend so I will be holding off on charting any levels or sharing that here until that is done\u2026 by Friday we should have a more normalized chart on futes to update and share.\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l984ugvncn5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f06641efbed95f2496cff3aeb4a652f5f930a909\n\nWell after QQQ put that demand in at 349.06 we now are pushing through that 354.95 supply and resistance area that was incredible resistance all of last week. \n\nWith a break through that and 357.09 the upside target is 361.7 demand\u2026. From there we have a bigger upside target of 369.32 and 371.41. \n\nIn the chance that we retrace tomorrow on QQQ the support would be 357.09 and major support at 354.95\u2026 \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 354.95 -&gt; 357.09 -&gt; 369.32  \n Demand- 349.06 -&gt; 361.7\n\n**VIX**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk51mrbocn5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b3ccbfbcdab7b03cbaa6f6ef13b37b5d33bc053d\n\nSo what do we have here\u2026 well of the last 5 CPIs this is the highest level the VIX has closed the day before CPI is released\u2026 Actually this is the highest the VIX has closed up (percent wise) since December CPI.\n\nNow what happened on those days? Well on March 14th SPY opened 1.33% green and on December 13th CPI SPY opened 2.8% green\u2026 what does that potentially mean? Well potentially we could get one of our biggest SPY opens in a very long time\u2026 I personally still do not think the risk to reward of swinging anything is worth it though\u2026\n\nI think for myself that in order for SPY to see a bigger green day and open tomorrow we need to see CORE YoY below 5.5% (it has been stuck between 5.5 and 5.6% for the last 4 readings) and we realistically need a surprise print in the 3s\u2026 if we get both of those I do confidently feel that we could see a 1% green open and potentially push for a 2% green day\u2026 that would give us about a 438.14 open and a close near 442.5\u2026\n\nHowever, if CORE remains high and if we some how get a miss on CPI YoY (higher than 4.1%) than I actually especially with CORE missing) would not be surprised to see a flat to red open. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tthd3uocn5b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8ef808b971ed346db57a00caa43b37e930567b72\n\nThe only thing I got right about today was a big VIX move up\u2026 I never would have imagined that SPY would put almost a 1% green day in while the VIX puts it biggest day in since May 4th\u2026 (for instance on May 4th spy closed -0.71%). \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl0oc59pcn5b1.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd272fd79c21b5d22b3c21489bab16e67a5f5b70\n\nToday was definitely not it for me\u2026 I continued to get slammed today and honestly today felt a lot like Thursday of last week for most of the day\u2026 \n\nAs a technical trader I have said multiple times that I look for SPY, VOLD and VIX to all be in congruence before I take a trade\u2026 today was yet again another time where we found that we were not in congruence\u2026 the biggest issue was definitely the VIX\u2026 watching the VIX pump with SPY is incredibly mind boggling. \n\nOverall small red day and not a big deal as I feel confident I can recover tomorrow as long as technicals move well again\u2026 \n\nIn the end remember not every day will be green\u2026 the days that play well to your strategy is where you should capitalize\u2026 however, days like today that your strategy struggles remember risk management is the key to success. IF you cant manage losers and red days well the green will never outweigh the red. ",

May be not the CPI print but the actual rate decision this week could definitely bring some volatility back. \n\nI didn\u2019t like that spike so I closed all my calls end of day. I sense a market pullback of 1-3% is brewing is my guess. This week could be interesting to trade to the short side.",

These are YoY so it's only relative to the year before...\n\nLet's say in May 2020, the basket of consumer goods (definition of CPI) costs $100. If May 2021's CPI is 4.0%, that means the same basket of goods cost $104. However, tomorrow's print for May 2023 will compare to May 2022's CPI.\n\nAnother way to look at it is this [graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL) from the St. Louis Fed. \"Raw\" Cpi (currently at \\~302) will always goes up. That's why hot dogs cost a nickel in the 1910s",

There's plenty of evidence for this already, which should lead to a cautiously neutral Fed even into the July meeting (yes, possibly two consecutive rate pauses):\n\n**Domestically**, there are early signs suggesting that the Fed has plenty of reason to pause in the near term, potentially even into Q4: \n\n* Weekly jobless claims were at highest level in two years\n* Unemployment rate surprised above median forecast\n* Nonfarm payrolls also edged higher as laborers re-entered workforce and move away from gig economy, which demonstrates worker uncertainty and slowing demand for food delivery/ride sharing\n* Fiscally, the upcoming bond issuance as per the recent extension of the federal credit limit will further draw down liquidity, acting as a *de facto* policy tightening without an explicitly higher Fed funds rate\n\n**Internationally**, it is clear that other central banks' policies have effectively stifled growth, which should give the Fed reassurance at home:\n\n* Eurozone/G12 economies recently enter technical recession\n* China export growth is slowing considerably\n* Oil demand is softening, OPEC+ requiring supply cuts to support prices",

The recent run up has caused about 60% decline and with every dip being bought and chances of a pause rate hike, I'm really not sure what to do.\n\nShould I just take my losses at this point and move on or wait for SPY to hit below $426 levels by 6/30?",

It's over. \n\nSure, maybe you can time some puts here and there, as we always get 5% pullbacks in bull markets, but every single one of those dips will get bought, without mercy. \n\nJPow is not going to raise 25bps at this meeting. He would have let everybody know already. Nikileaks already said they were going to do a pause. Any back tracking is a bad look for the fed.\n\nI also welcome the call for a recession. Germany fell into recession officially, and the DAX (german index) didn't even flinch, and is sitting 1% off its ATH.\n\nPriced in.\n\nGood luck bears, you'll need it.",

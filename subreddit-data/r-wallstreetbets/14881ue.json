After yesterday's announcement stock went up by 5% and i made exactly 34.99$, sold it and now I'm heading to preorder. Thought it's kinda funny.",

I am expecting Live Service in the coming decade to increase profitability by a lot. (And of course more great RPGs)",

Warren Buffet mostly uses fundamental values: profitability, slight growth, a moat - high entry barriers.\n\nThen there are traders using technical analysis, basically the movement/trend of the stock.\n\nWSB gamblers mostly bet on extreme price swings, e.g., around earning reports, based on random information, like Wendy queue length. (Some other also do some great analysis and find flaws in the stock market or brokers or specific spots)\n\nPrivate investors might invest on news, or in companies they know and love.\n\nIn general, there are lots of things to consider when investing in a company: fundamental values (does company make a profit and grows?), technical values (does the chart go up?), sentiment (how do people feel about the company?), leadership (is the CEO ruining the company?), news &amp; outlook (is the company expected to change to the better in the future?).\n\nUsually the market price considers many different things, as different people buy/sell the stock because of different reasons.

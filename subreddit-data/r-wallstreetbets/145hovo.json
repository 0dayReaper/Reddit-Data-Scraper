    "postText": "So I want to first start this off by clearing a few things up\u2026 Wednesday I made a post looking for $400 basically by middle of July\u2026 then what happened over night? Well yesterday markets called for a pump so I had to be bullish for today\u2026 there is a very different time frame to have on some of these posts\u2026 that $400 target is a 30-45dte target\u2026 however, I still have overnight and intraweek moves that may inverse that\u2026 This market is ruthless and can not make its mind up for more than a minute sometimes\u2026\n\nWith that being said I am bearish for Monday\u2026 based on todays technicals\u2026 we will get to that but lets talk about CPI and FOMC first\u2026 \n\n**EVENT CALENDER** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vdvc1xsra25b1.png?width=877&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aa8186d8ece9e1b544ada3aa3b39a6b4ec6a4d91\n\n**CPI/ FOMC**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pb5ceqdsa25b1.png?width=723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8fafeb023689f2861cd32839218d29dbf886f007\n\nI am waiting on bloomberg terminal numbers right now\u2026 hoping to get them this weekend (if anyone has access DM me\u2026 if not I gotta wait on one of my other sources)\u2026 but the way im seeing it right now is that cleveland fed nowcast and consensus are all pretty much spot on\u2026 the biggest thing to note here is that CPI is calling for a print in the 4s\u2026 we even if all goes well could see a print in the 3s! that would be wild to be honest\u2026 also note for next month nowcast is already calling for a 3.3% CPI print!\n\nSo the question is how do we trade this and what is the market going to do? Well I would NOT trade this at all\u2026 why? Simple\u2026 its been months since we have had a decent reaction that would make the risk to reward of the payout worth it\u2026\n\nNow how will the market react? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrpc2wqsa25b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=263f9f2bb8a15fdd477af504f928a9ac9e6c9e1d\n\nAs you can see here the last month things have been very up and down\u2026 but as of current time of writing this\u2026 the markets see the highest odds of a PAUSE at this meeting next week\u2026 now this is where I still think the markets have it wrong\u2026 there has been ZERO indication for JPOW about a pause\u2026 pretty much every time JPOW himself has actually spoken he has ALWAYS said he is going to do a 25bps hike and that there is NO RATE CUTS this year\u2026 now this is really where I think markets have it all wrong\u2026\n\nThe markets were pricing in 75bps of cuts by EOY\u2026 Impressively\u2026 the markets now have the highest odds of NO RATE CUTS by end of year.. I do think the markets finally have this correct\u2026 however, while the odds may be correct now\u2026. I do not see the markets reacting correctly\u2026 \n\nI do think if JPOW hikes 25bps on Wednesday (which is highly probable in my opinion) that we will see a negative reaction to that\u2026 but I do see that as a likely call entry opportunity whenever that sell off stops\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlrqya6ta25b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fe30468d1a5f8a00f101375ed9ec800c07663c0a\n\nWell after putting that 426.6 demand in we have now immediately turned around and put a new supply in at 429.13\u2026 however, do you see the issue with it? We are imbalanced.. why? Simply because today we are going to close higher than where the supply is put in\u2026 that means markets will need to come back down OR immediately turn around and make a new demand Monday\u2026 \n\nOne interesting thing is that since pretty much April 26th SPY has not broken through a previous demand after establishing a supply\u2026 what do I mean\u2026 I mean lets take that 410.2 demand\u2026 after markets put that in and put in a new supply (was around 420) the markets held that 420.1 demand and did not close below it\u2026 we have been stair stacking (bullishly) new demands since 404 area. \n\nHowever with 3 supplies here at this 428-430 area now this has become one extremely strong resistance\u2026 \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0h22ylta25b1.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e9999d3f0e05e2cab71328c9f02b94ba5570f6be\n\nThere is actually no changes to the weekly time frame here\u2026 we closed over previous supply and did not put in a new supply\u2026 DMI remains overbought and SPY remains ready to put in a new supply on any red week\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le6b011ua25b1.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fe3b4eb700fb2e2572fb6e1f7a080508ee4c522f\n\nSPY daily here remains in this black bull channel that it has been in since May 23rd\u2026 we also have the bigger broad red/blue bull channel since March 8th\u2026\n\nNow this is a CLASSIC bearish reversal pattern with this evening doji star closure\u2026 we also once again failed to close over 430.. We did close higher than the august 16th closure but we did not close over 430 yet again\u2026 this would be 4 failed rejections in the last 5 trading days from closing over 430. \n\nI would not be surprised to see price come back down to 426.5 demand (support) or perhaps 428 supply on Monday\u2026 however, I do forsee it still being bullish\u2026 honestly until this black bull channel is broken and really until we close under the daily 20ema this remains bullish and dips remain call opportunities\u2026 \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8l2cfofua25b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4dc43cc0eba6ffe5993d38aaea51f2c07600a889\n\nI think this weekly chart clearly shows the overall trend and shows everything the best\u2026 \n\nHere you can see since the beginning of march we have been in this blue bull channel. Until SPY breaks under that weekly support (419 for next week) as you can see by the wicks this remains a buy the dip market\u2026 we also have a large red/ blue rising wedge that we have been trading within since middle of September\u2026 that resistance sits at 436.1 for next week. \n\nSPY WEEKLY LEVELS  \n Supply- 416.08 -&gt; 427.35 -&gt; 453.23  \n Demand- 411.57 -&gt; 381.74  \n Support- 428.2 -&gt; 422.1 -&gt; 418.6  \n Resistance- 430 -&gt; 436.9 -&gt; 444.3\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uxbf4bwua25b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e9edcf40580e29d2541b7078b372895ca5286e40\n\nNot surprisingly here futures followed suit of SPY and also put in a new supply at 4298. We actually are imbalanced on futures which does not usually happen. So that will be interesting to watch get sorted out over next week.. as of right now futes minimally needs to close under 4299 in order to be balanced. \n\n4312 is the supply and resistance from the august high and we once again failed to close over that level\u2026 it is safe to assume for now 4312 is strong resistance. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzs6k4eva25b1.png?width=872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a811d49b20225642ea0fd966735623df11337137\n\nNo changes to futures weekly supply and demand\u2026 we are attempting to make 4284 into a support, however, it is not set up to turn it into a demand which would be incredible bullish. \n\nNOTE ON FUTURES- on tradingview (where I primarily chart) the contracts rolled over night and when that happens the charting is always messed up for about a week because there was about a 100pt gap up due to that\u2026 there is a way to adjust for contracts but none of my levels are adjusted for that so it would throw everything off\u2026 for now I wont be including Futes daily or weekly price action until things normalize some\u2026 I will not include support/ resistance either as it is incorrect.\n\nFUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS-  \n Supply weekly- 4193 -&gt; 4284 -&gt; 4540  \n Supply daily- 4240 -&gt; 4292 -&gt; 4298 -&gt; 4312  \n Demand weekly- 4130 -&gt; 3921  \n Demand daily- 4273 -&gt; 4188\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7f36vzwva25b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=beb97a78ce8b16f7c9e64b31e456912c7c6629e2\n\nNow I said yesterday I was VERY bullish on QQQ and that I was looking for 358-361\u2026 we ended up coming super close at open with hitting 357.66 but we did come up and retest that 357.09 supply and once again failed to break through and close over that level\u2026 we actually have really turned 354.95 supply into a major resistance here with this being the 5th rejection in 6 days at this level\u2026 \n\nNow we did put in a new demand at 349.06 today\u2026 however, I will say I am VERY bearish on QQQ for Monday\u2026 \n\nI would not be surprised at all to see QQQ come back down to at least 351 on Monday\u2026 If you look at QQQ objectively since 5/26 it has been holding within a 347.93 to 357.09 range for 10 closes in a row now\u2026 this right now is our consolidation period/ range\u2026 \n\nQQQ likely could drop down to 350-351 Monday and could possibly put in a new supply at 354.5 area.. if it did that then we absolutely would look for 348-349 to bounce us and look to long it back to 357. However, IF we can retrace to 349-351 and not put in a new supply I would actually be even more bullish and would look for 361.7 demand to be taken out next week. \n\nNow daily DMI is waving up which is bullish and we did hold the daily 8ema today\u2026 however, that massive evening doji star bearish reversal candle certainly should result in a drop\u2026 daily also broke extreme bull momentum\u2026 \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vub7bdwa25b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7866d11220bd8648c87cf114d36a581a119cfd70\n\nNow on QQQ weekly here this is looking far more bearish\u2026 we just put in a double top with back to back dojis with a weekly supply at 354.65. This is our first supply since the first week of May. \n\nNow only that but we also have a weekly DMI wave down forming here on QQQ. I will say though that despite this bearish set up that we have here\u2026 QQQ weekly remains in extreme bull momentum (despite the daily losing it) which means the weekly 8ema likely will be support on any retrace\u2026 that weekly 8ema should sit somewhere near 340 next week. Impressively QQQ weekly has NOT broken through the 8ema since the first week of may (5 weeks in a row) and we have not closed under the weekly 8ema since the week of March 6th. \n\nAs you can see we are working on a yellow rising wedge since the week of December 12th. \n\nFor me we have that 330.67 supply to keep an eye on next week\u2026 However, that would not only break the weekly 8ema but would also break the 6 month long rising wedge support\u2026 I do not think QQQ has seen the weakness and top to do that\u2026 likely weekly support will sit at 337.7 at the lowest next week but I will look for 339-340 to be a bounce point. \n\nOn the upside if we immediately bounce higher next week we actually could turn this weekly 354.65 supply immediately into a demand which would be incredibly bullish. Upside resistance of the wedge sits at 359.94 and we have a weekly supply at 361.85 to keep an eye on. \n\nQQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  \n Supply- 330.67 -&gt; 354.65 -&gt; 361.85  \n Demand- 322.47 -&gt; 316.18\n\n**VIX**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1n41wwa25b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a4a790f94d48dd3ae4e65e39904f59f4c7b977de\n\nEven though it looked like the VIX would never recover and was just going to keep falling and falling and falling\u2026. We actually did it\u2026 we actually put in a new daily demand (support) on the VIX at 13.62! \n\nThis is our first demand the VIX has put in since May 18th\u2026 \n\nFun fact about the VIX and putting in Demands (taking the move from low to high of when VIX puts in a demand till its next supply)\u2026  \n March 6th= VIX +65.6%, SPY -6.5%  \n March 14th= VIX +34.1%, SPY -2.5%  \n March 21st= VIX +16.9%, SPY -2.3%  \n April 4th= VIX +8.1%, SPY -1.42%  \n April 6th= VIX +9%, **SPY +0.71%**  \n April 18th= VIX +20%, SPY -2.9%  \n May 1st= VIX +37.2%, SPY -3.3%  \n May 11th= VIX +9.6%, SPY -0.6%  \n May 18th= VIX +29.9%, SPY -2.6%\n\nThis is becoming my new favorite thing to do\u2026 What does this show? \n\nOn average over the last 9 times the VIX has put a new demand (support) in it has bounced 25.6% and SPY has fallen -2.38%. There is one time in April though where SPY did randomly push higher despite the VIX pushing up 9%... \n\nBut what does this mean? Well this means that if this plays out like normal the VIX will see around $17 and SPY could drop to $421.7 before we put a new supply in on the VIX (I will calculate that out once that happens). \n\nNow thre is always the chance with low daily volatility and daily/ weekly extreme bear momentum that we do not do that and immediately turn around and put a new supply in\u2026 but I will say since November there has not been a time we have seen with the supply indicator this low that we have immediately turned around a put a new supply in\u2026\n\nThe highest probability is that we see a bounce here on the VIX and drop on SPY\u2026 we also broke the 12 day long bear channel today\u2026 the next step is for bears to close VIX over the daily 8ema and this should breakout. \n\nNext week with CPI and FOMC truly could be really spicy\u2026 \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lim9sh9ya25b1.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7dc2cbd9cbdb84cc9d694b77aedb1789b268d216\n\nWell I wasn\u2019t supposed to be trading today\u2026 but ended up getting home earlier than expected and was able to get some solid trading in today. Today was a refreshing breath of air after getting absolutely wrecked yesterday\u2026 today was perfect trading and felt perfect to trade, however, after about 145 I will say that we once again say internals not matching correctly\u2026 \n\nOverall I failed to reach my weekly profit goal but on an extremely positive note here I was able to break the curse of Fridays by putting in a green day (even after realizing my tsla loss). \n\nThis close out as a nice green week and I am not too upset with the results especially after how brutal yesterday was. \n\nI have now been green for the last 10 weeks in a row which is one week shorter than my longest weekly streak in 2022! \n\nI hope you guys all have a great weekend and I will see you guys next week!

We saw that with pce because traders baked in that voting fed members will skip this month and hike next month. The feds do not like to make movements that differ from what they\u2019ve hinted at to the market. The fact that they\u2019ve been radio silent when any of them could\u2019ve hinted in a OpEd or leak something to the media seems to indicate their stance is still a skip this month, IMO.\n\nI think the main issue will be their commentary and if rates will be 1) higher for longer, and 2) per Powells last comment, if terminal rate is 25bps away\n\nI really hope Monday doesn\u2019t open red for my own sake, but there may be more profit taking as people continue to keep liquidity on the sidelines until FOMC.\n\nLastly, mega caps are largely down for the week while the SPY is up. IMO the bull market has legs if there\u2019s been a rotation into other companies and risk on sentiment.",

Why? Because if you sell the put and that price goes to zero value you hit a max win. \n\nSomeone else BOUGHT that for $98 and basically paid you to buy it... \n\nNow if price goes against you... the loss is unlimited. Why? Because technically (up and till the strike) price can unlimited go up. \n\nSo theoretically if you sold the put on spy and then spy had a 100% day your max loss is $43k. \n\nWhy? Because $430 is basically closing price (for easy math) and x100 (contract value) = $43,000\n\nSo losses are yes technically unlimited but in reality the max loss is really the 43k assuming that $10 put went to be $430 which with it being a  $430 strike is max value it can hit.",

It held most of the gap up, extremely bullish as buyers are still interested.\n\nMy next play is $PCW Calls. This stock has been on a bull run. Every dip is being bought and it rallies as soon as spy finds support.

So on Friday, I was looking to short the pops. The trade worker became I am fully aware of current market conditions and have adapted to trade what\u2019s  in front of me.\n\nNow if we were back in January 2023, when we had a up trending market with actual follow through, I would have never bought puts, but instead would have added to my longs and let them ride as much as I can until market signals a resistance level.  \n\nI put market first before placing my trades. You need to be aware of the current market conditions. OP was very bullish on Friday, probably expecting an uptrend, but failing to recognize we are in a sideways market. \n\nSounds like either you just don\u2019t trade, are not fully aware of the current market conditions.",

People are still out in force spending like drunken sailors. There's no fucking way we sre getting a CPI print less than 4.5% and frankly I think it will be 5%. Nobody is saving money. Everyone is spending.\n\n3) Food prices have been increasing again lately. A few months ago everything was on sale. Now few items are on sale and even prices at Costco have increased. If the data is objective, it'll show inflation is sticking, not fading.",

What exactly does that mean? (Newbie!  But I gather that you write these posts to help folks like me - thank you!)  I thought Supply = Resistance, and Demand = Support, but you have different numbers for each of those pairs, so I'm puzzled/stupid.  I'm going to go back and watch your most recent video and see if I can figure it out there.\n\nThanks for all of the great info that you provide!",

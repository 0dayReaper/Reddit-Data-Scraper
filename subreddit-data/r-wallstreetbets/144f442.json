    "postText": "For the love of god, you imbeciles, please don\u2019t forget to hedge down this NASDAQ AI bubble. I\u2019m proud of the gains you have all posted, but the party doesn\u2019t have to stop when the bulls run out of steam. \n\nThis is very reminiscent of the 2021 tech bull run, but we all know to be fearful when others are greedy (and greedy when others are fearful). 6 months ago when we thought the sky was falling, you all made bank. Soon, it\u2019ll time for an inversion.   \n\nDebit spreads are a relatively cheap, theta-neutral way to defend against your autism. \n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f season soon.",

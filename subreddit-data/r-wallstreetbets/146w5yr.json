(NYSE:PLTR) is suggested to be 49% undervalued based on its intrinsic value calculated using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity (DCF) model. The projected fair value is set at US$29.65, significantly higher than the current share price of US$15.02 and the analyst price target of US$9.54. The DCF model estimates future cash flows and discounts them to present value. Key assumptions of this model include an estimated 8.1% discount rate and future cash flows based on a combination of analyst estimates and extrapolations from previous free cash flow. The valuation, which accounts for 10 years of cash flows and a terminal value, sums to a total equity value of US$63b.  \n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-palantir-technologies-inc-125453923.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-palantir-technologies-inc-125453923.html)",

They did 350M in 21 and 220M in 22. Three of the last five years have had negative FCF. Then they have them growing at like 30% a year from there. The output is bullish because their inputs are bullish.\n\nEdit: also lol at their 8.1% cost of equity assumption for a 30B tech company with SOFR at 5%",

Just buy some ETF exposure and let that this go up. Because nobody actually knows how this shit trades but we as a society assumes it will collectively we worth a lot more tomorrow regardless of cash flow, so it goes up \n\nIs Palantir undervalued? Fuck it maybe. But a DCF under pinned by \"who the fuck knows\" for your FCF forecast, terminal assumptions, and WACC is exactly why every M&amp;A pitch deck in the sector traditionally is just gonna box the forward revenue multiples on trading comps and disregard the rest of the football field since it's all fucking guess work for the sake of completeness lol.",

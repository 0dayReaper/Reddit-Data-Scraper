    "postText": "I am looking into options and bought 30x 250 tsla calls (9/14) with an average cost of 0.18$ only worth 4,50$. I know it is a small position, but I wanted to try.\nA few questions:\nCan someone explain to me what happens to these options if tsla hits 250$ within the time? What happens at 251, 252 ? What would be a good cash out point in your opinion?",

For every dollar that Tesla's stock price is above $250, your option will increase in value by one cent. So if Tesla's stock price hits $251, your option would be worth 1 cent more than it was when you bought it (0.18 + 0.01 = 0.19). IfTesla's stock price hit $252, your option would be worth 2 cents more than when you bought it (0.18 + 0.02 = 0.20), and so on up to the expiration date of your options contract",

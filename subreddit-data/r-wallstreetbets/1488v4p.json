You can argue about its validity but even big hedge fund guys use the phrase, for better or worse.\n\nI realize that for every buyer there must be a seller.

If you want me to be technically correct I can say \"the buying pressure is higher than selling pressure\" or \"the premium people are willing to pay for stocks is high\" or... you get the point. \n\nBut carry on. Just realize that you're sending out your OMG LMFAO at a phrase that you'll hear billionaires use. It isn't technically correct, but it's in the vernacular.\n\nThere's an answer you didn't deserve.",

    "postText": "I've only been trading for a few years and up until recently I had always tried to catch stocks at lows and hold them until their highs and mostly just ended up holding a lot of bags. Buying shares and call options just doesn't work out in my favor 99% of the time. So I started doing the exact opposite and buying puts on stocks reaching all time highs after drastic single day jumps and after a week of doing this my portfolio has increased 4x and I'm finally at an all-time net gain for the first time since I started messing around with the stock market. It's hard to ignore the observations that stocks just generally go down more than they go up these days and the last week has cemented this observation in my mind as fact. I almost feel a little guilty betting on failure but it seems to be the only way to get ahead at all anymore.",

The key is to be nimble and take advantage of short-term opportunities when they present themselves. That's where puts can come in handy. By betting against stocks that are due for a fall, you can often make a tidy profit very quickly. Just be careful not to get too greedy or overleverage yourself, as markets can always turn around unexpectedly and leave you nursing heavy losses.",

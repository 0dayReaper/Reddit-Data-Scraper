AI is very broad but requires some level of making predictions/finding patterns on unseen input/data, either through training with labels, or pattern recognition/stochastic modelling.

Most of the modern, high accuracy, AI are not interpretable due to hidden layers of weighting on decisions, which is why they can have a real bias issue slip through.\n\nAt what point to we care about a 0.001% accuracy gain over fair decision making, cost, speed and interoperability?",

I Inevitably have to go to the counter and have it fixed because the person in the kitchen couldn\u2019t follow the directions and make the order correctly. Until AI is more directly involved in the actual making of the food and packaging the order this is just pointless. Think about how frustrating it is to talk to a customer service chat bot. You cannot replace top tier human customer service and that\u2019s the first thing the corporate penny pinchers are trying to eliminate. I would rather have AI integrated into the machine making the food with an actual person as the point of contact with the customers. I guess I\u2019m just a boomer.

    "postText": "Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers\nFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment\u2019s price.\u00a0\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\u00a0\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\n\n\nUptrending Tickers\u00a0\n\n\n* JNPR  7/21/23  30C  .95\n* MU 7/21/23  70C  1.76\n* WBA  7/21/23  32.5C  1.05\n* PLAY  7/21/23  40C  1.50\n\nDowntrending Tickers\n\n\n* DELL  7/21/23  47.5P  1.45\n* WDC  7/21/23  40P  1.98\n* IBM  7/21/23  130P  1.74\n* INTC  7/21/23  31P  1.07\n* MRVL  7/21/23  55P  1.41\n* AAPL  7/21/23  170P 1.88\n* F  7/21/23  14P  .75\n* CSCO  7/21/23 50P  1.32\n* ADBE  7/21/23  50P. 1.34\n* CMSCA  7/21/23  40P  1.03\n* BAC  7/21/23  30P  1.40\n* FDMT  7/21/23  17.5P  1.65\n\nThings to consider when finding the plays-\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.\u00a0\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.\u00a0 (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)\u00a0\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",

The float is only 24 million, so there could be some big moves in this stock today.\n\nMU is another good long play. This stock is up 3% premarket on heavy volume of 7 million shares traded already today. With a float of only 48 million, this stock could see some big moves as well.",

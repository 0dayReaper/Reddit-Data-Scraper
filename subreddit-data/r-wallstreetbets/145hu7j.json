Some board member or someone working for them: old news, some of these people are in their roles since 2020.\n3. Patents: really old news, decades old.\n4. OEM announcement: that announcement that everyone is waiting for. Not sure where they got that \"information\" from.\n\nBut for all the regarded individuals trading this up or down, enjoy the chaos as long as it lasts.

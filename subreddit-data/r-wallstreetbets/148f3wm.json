But when AI came out in '22, I think it really came into it\u2019s own, commercially and artistically. The whole sector has a clear, crisp direction, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the stocks a big boost. It\u2019s been compared to the DotCom bubble, but I think AI has a far more bitter, cynical sense of direction.",

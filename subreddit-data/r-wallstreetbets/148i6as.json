    "postText": "Poorly covered in the press. Yes NVIDIA is selling a lot of high margin AI product as Cloud datacenters scale to handle the demand. Be aware they are being positioned as the only option. They are not and in fact have solutions that do not benchmark at the top. \n\nAlso be aware that the network infrastructure for AI to AI interconnect is different than historical DC networking.  To address this Google (creator of the modern Tensorcore) created a new networking paradigm - Apollo.   Facebook is working on similar and Tesla (every car is machine learning)  implemented their own (superior) Tensorcore array called DOJO.   Apple is investing deeply into AI and more of the M processor die space will have Tensorcores. AMD and Intel of course are in also in play.\n\nI state this because the hypster press would have you believe NVIDIA has a lock. Not at all. They did not invent it BUT are doing a great job of holding their installed base with it.   The barrier to entry is LOW.  PCI interfaces, memory structures and Tensorcores are all pedestrian readily available tech. NOBODY has a monopoly on it. No moat.\n\nSeveral other players are also making purpose built AI clusters that scale well beyond anything NVIDIA can even do.   Watch for acquisitions. \n\n[Cerebras](https://www.cerebras.net/)",

Other hardware exists but you basically need to go write custom everything to use the other stuff.\n\nThe only other manufacturer that has a history of building out tools this way was Intel so if Intel can get their crap together they might be able to compete for the AI market.

That's not to say that say Intel's AI projects will not shoot themselves in the foot but likely not. Its \"technically\" a slam dunk. Same for AMD. Now Intel could do very well because they own their own fabs which NVIDIA does not. Look at Intel's up and coming GPUs - for a first shot - very very good. (Mostly a software problem.)  Note that the other GPU market was Crypto Mining. Intel made an incredible chip for Crypto - and released it RIGHT when the market tanked.  \n\nSecond bit for the non-techies - A model - once trained is very portable. So it can start on NVIDIA today but migrate tomorrow. This is not \"non-portable Windows\" that only runs on one platform. (It doesn't anymore.)  Again - no moat.  So play the market but know the landscape.  There is a LOT coming down the pipeline.",

Nothing new.  Keep in mind that not all semis require the latest submicron (becoming angstrom) fabs. Most power components do not and cannot.\n\nWhere you see these fabs are in ultra leading edge high volume (commodity) markets. Specifically SOC's (cell phones et al), DRAM, FLASH, CPUs and GPUs. \n\nFabs are so expensive that even the big cash cows (Apple) do not spin up their own. \n\nWhat will be interesting is as big and high margin the Datacenter is - the gaming GPU market had the volume for NVIDIA the last I heard.  NVIDIA plays all sorts of games to make sure the product designed for one is not used in the other - in an attempt to preserve margins.  Some workarounds have evolved.",

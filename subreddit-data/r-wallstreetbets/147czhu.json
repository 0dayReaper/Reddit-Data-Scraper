I\u2019ve been looking into airlines that took on a lot of this debt and with the possibility of fuel prices increasing I don\u2019t think the prognosis is good, thoughts? Any other industries to consider?",

            "comment": "&gt;The airline industry is definitely one to watch closely in the coming months, as they are highly leveraged and will be feeling the pain of increasing rates. Fuel prices are a major concern for them, and if they continue to rise it could spell trouble for the sector. Other industries that have taken on a lot of debt during Covid and may be affected by rising rates include retail (which has already been struggling) and hospitality.",

Totally a good idea to look for smaller companies with little coverage that might fly under the radar.\n\nLooking at the major airlines is a complete waste of time due to how heavily covered they are by both equity and credit analysts. Everyone and their mother knows what their debt situation is.",

Where they raised bank debt, it\u2019s often hedged with swaps. Maybe some small &amp; mid-caps might be exposed though - they tend to have less robust risk management processes.",

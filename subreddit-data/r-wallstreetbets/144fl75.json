    "postText": "Canada could exceed the  largest total amount of burned area recorded in this country in a single  year. Natural Resources Canada released updated data and forecasts  Monday showing that, as of June 4, there had been 2,214 wildfires across  Canada this year, and about 3.3 million hectares burned. The 10-year  average over the same timeframe is 1,624 fires and 254,429 hectares  burned.\n\nThe  department said it is unusual to have blazes across most of the country  this early in the wildfire season, and that Canada could pass the annual  record for burned area if the current rate of fire activity continues.\n\n**British Columbia, Quebec and Alberta** produced 81% of Canada's softwood lumber in 2020. Lots of fires mean not only is inventory damaged, but timber operations are hampered due to inability to get to affected areas, but also temporary emergency orders about having chainsaws, jerry cans etc in tinder dry areas.\n\nDuring the pandemic, lumber futures mooned. Lumber producers and resellers made huge money off of those shortages. As lumber prices crashed, their profits and stocks sank with it. The lumber bros must be dying for an excuse to pump lumber prices back up to the moon during the busy summer building season. \n\n$WOOD is the closest ETF the loosely tracks Lumber Futures. Call volume and IV are still low for now with everyone obsessed with AI. 8/18 79c are $0.25/ea and could return 2300% if $WOOD re-tests it's 52w high.\n\nPositions: 50x 8/18 76c, 100x 8/18 80c  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/scrih2ynxt4b1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=80505c1da1ace4e73f39b4e4d1b79258b106fb23",

As a Canadian, you'd be surprised at how crazy our bleeding heart environmentalist activists can be. We had some \"activists\" (they correctly call em arsonists, but if you call them that they'll try to cancel u on social media lol) set fire to vehicles at a hotel used by a lot of builders/contractors for the pipeline. Workers surrounded by axe wielding maniacs and had equipment hijacked and damaged equipments to slow down the building. 500 workers were besieged and had to have RCMP (Our police force) come in to enforce and protect them. And I recall there was even some form of bombing at one of the multiple sights last year or this year, can't find the source of that one though. From my knowledge no charges were pressed.\n\nNow about the charred wood... I wouldn't be surprised if these environmentalist would argue that they need to leave these trees alone so that they can benefit the soil etc. They'll make up any excuse to prevent you from chopping down a tree, even if it's one that's diseased and may spread to other trees, but because it's a 100 yrs old+ tree, it's protected and naysayers will cry bleeding hearts for it. I'm not an anti-environmentalist, I'm just rationale. If there's an overabundance of tree or there's a need to cut down some to prevent a potential wildfire. Cut it, don't let it be a fire potential, but nooooo if you say such things they'll call you a oil baron, anti-environmentalist, neo nazi and you deserve to be cancelled... Yea people can think I'm exaggerating, but there crazies in every countries. U.S uses guns, Canada uses cancel/words/knives.\n\nSource:[https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/attacks-ignite-concerns-that-enviro-violence-is-returning-to-b-c-s-pipeline-country](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/attacks-ignite-concerns-that-enviro-violence-is-returning-to-b-c-s-pipeline-country)",

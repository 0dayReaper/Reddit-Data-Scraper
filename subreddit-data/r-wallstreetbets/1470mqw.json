I was telling the true believers a crash was coming and to get out knowing full well they wouldn't listen, just like I'm telling non-believers on the other side that a new bull market is coming now.    I had the confidence of my conclusions and it massively paid off.   It more than covered the down payment on a very nice house.  \n\nIt's always possible I thought I had if all figured out and instead just got crazy lucky to coincide with bad assumptions, but I don't personally think so. I'm hopeful that the money I set aside for this round will return 7 figure gains, But even that's not the case, and it turns out I'm wrong, I'll still be ahead of the game by more than 6 figures even after my losses.   The amount intend to reinvest is less than 20% of what I took out. \n\nI'm pretty sure I've got my eyes open pretty clearly here.  I see it's zealots on both sides.  I'm not one.  Bitcoin will blow up again; and then it will crash again. Thus has it always been.",

Even if I'm 100% right in my conclusions, black swan events happen. I understand I am taking a risk. But the calculation isn't whether it's risk free or not but weather it's good **pot odds**. I'm quite confident that the ratio of risk to reward here is heavily skewed in my favor.  Rather than offer any evidence to suggest I'm wrong, you approach this from the default assumption I am.

On the trend side, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained significant mainstream attention and adoption. Institutional investors, corporations, and even governments have shown interest in blockchain technology and have begun integrating cryptocurrencies into their operations. Additionally, decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a major trend, offering new financial services and investment opportunities.\n\nHowever, along with these trends, crypto struggles have also surfaced. One of the key challenges is regulatory uncertainty. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are grappling with how to oversee and regulate cryptocurrencies effectively, which has led to a lack of clarity and inconsistent policies. This uncertainty can create obstacles for businesses and investors, affecting the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSecurity concerns remain a critical struggle as well. While blockchain technology itself is highly secure, incidents of hacking, fraud, and scams still occur in the crypto space. The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies can make it challenging to recover stolen funds or hold perpetrators accountable.",

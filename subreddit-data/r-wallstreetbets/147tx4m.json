Additionally, Microsoft could not agree that they would not increase the price of gamepass immediately if the deal successfully competed.  Video games have always been dominated by foreign competitors.  To challenge them, Microsoft has bought up studios, developers and IPs left and right, over the years\u2026only to put out less games than they had previously.  From the appearance, Microsoft does not want to have to compete.  They want to buy up the market, hide away/shelve IPs and essentially shrink the market itself while maintaining their same share.  That is anti-consumer and against the principles of competition.\n\nThis is not the \u201cAmerica good, foreign companies bad\u201d situation to defend.  Microsoft is certainly not the one to stand behind.",

It's cheaper to hire some lawyers and lobby a few politicians to get the FTC to investigate Microsoft from buying up the \"online FPS\" market or whatever. \n\nMaybe someone in the FTC is a Sony fanboy or maybe someone paid enough for some old coot in charge to give a damn. It makes no difference, the amount one company owns of whatever video game market is arbitrary. It's money and politics that push that line of what's anti-competitive and what is.",

They have suffered from massive brain drain. I literally play their games I have seen the massive amount of talent that has literally left Blizzard from multiple teams over the last 3-4 years.\n\nThey have completely lost the Chinese market in the short term in a very messy exit from the market. \n\nThey have no real future plan for their IP\u2019s, WoW is dead and showing no signs of life. OW2 is their cash cow but who knows how long that milk will flow. \n\nDiablo 4 is obviously the hot talk of the town but as someone who is deep in the end game of that I only see it having moderate success in the long term with their seasonal BP model. \n\nThings at Blizz are bleak man.",

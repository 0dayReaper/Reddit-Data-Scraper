    "postText": "In September 2021, **Bumble filed** with the SEC **a Registration Statement for the Company's SPO.**\n\nThe registration statement didn't forget to mention 1.7B likes (over the course of 6 years) and 42M monthly active users in Q32020. \n\nBut it did not include the following information:\n\n1. Bumble had actually lost tens of thousands of paying users during the quarter;\n2. Paying users had been more reluctant to sign up for the Bumble app during 3Q21 because of the recent price hike for paid services on the app;\n3. A number of paying users were leaving the Badoo app due to problems arising from Bumble\u2019s transition of its payment platform \n\nGradually the actual situation became public and **the stock went from $60 in September 2021 to $35 in November 2021.**\n\nTo settle claims and avoid further litigation **Bumble is going to pay shareholders $18M in cash.** Any investor who has traded $BMBL could be eligible for part of that money.   \n**You can calculate the payout and file for compensation** [**here**](https://11thestate.com/cases/bumble-investors-settlement)**.** (also you can prepare the documents yourself and send them to the settlement administrator's address)\n\nObviously 18M not gonna make up for investors' losses, but this kind of corporate misconduct needs to be regulated.",

Also, it seems to be a dating app that caters to women sending the first message so guys would be more reluctant to pay considering there are other apps. ....anyone know how badoo is I haven't tried that one.               their competition I think its match group no? seems to be better at separating both demographics from their money but I would like to know more.",

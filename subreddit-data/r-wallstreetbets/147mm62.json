Notice that in the last decade, charging stations have quadrupled in availability? Notice that Ford F-150 Lightning is a gold standard in EV trucks right now? The perception has shifted in this last decade and if you look beyond headlines to numbers in sales and comments from EV owners, this is the turning point we waited decades for. \n\nTesla relied on Superchargers to be the hook to get people to BUY TESLA. Opening them up to other manufacturers screams to anyone paying attention that their sales are slipping and they want to profit off their network before the competition catches up. Most current EV owners now charge at home and with Level 2 chargers from competitors also entering the market, Tesla is trying to justify to shareholders to keep holding because of \u201cnew revenue\u201d before the inevitable news of other brands outselling Tesla eventually happens.",

Tesla chargers are extremely fast. And they are omnipresent. And with government subsidies, they can now build even more to corner the market.

I don't know what you are paying attention to but speculation can only get you so far if you don't understand the company's fundamentals, seeing your comment about other manufacturers being caught up is a perfect example of it. If you actually look past the articles and \"analysts\" and listen to what the actual companies that produce vehicles are saying, they can't catch up to tesla because tesla moves faster than they do.

My condo got a quote for almost a $10k special assessment per unit to add chargers to 10% of the parking places. Digging up streets to provide upgraded electrical service can be expensive. We also don't have room in the basement for the electrical equipment, so we would either lose several parking spaces or some of the deeded storage rooms. Currently, we're waiting on the electrical company to upgrade the service to the local substation to 230 kV, but Seattle has been fighting that since 2013. I remember them putting up a sign before Christmas that year to notify the public of the request for a permit. Last I heard, it's waiting on a \"geotechnical review,\" whatever that means.  Before that it was stalled after a lawsuit challenging their \"projected inability to service customers\" statement. We're still waiting.",

By allowing your competitors access to your super exclusive store, you have diminished your brand and while making a few bucks on the bottom line, overall you removed a huge benefit for people to get your credit card over the competing ones.",

GM always made better body to handle the roads. With electric cost per mile differences are not going to be huge. So basically electric engine will make people go for bigger car since cost per mile differential is not going to be that much. I will finally buy a hummer but it is going to be electrical. That switch for Ford and GM is probably still a couple of years away. Ford and GM stopped dividend payment to invest in electrical plants and retooling research etc. Recently both started paying dividend again. I read that as they have made enough investment and will very shortly roll out their all electric line. We are seeing them arrive in ones or twos. Like volt,bolt, Lightning, MachE, Hummer, etc. By the way there is huge demand for hummer. GM is not being able to meet the demand. These two companies have huge loyal customer base. GM for me and Ford for many of my wealthy friends who are car enthusiasts and related business owner. They will absolutely buy trucks and performance cars. So GM and ford will gain market share. But the market is also going to increase in size. So i am not negative on Tesla. Tesla is not only cars. They bought the most successful solar power company. They are the leader in that business. No big player offer competition in solar business. They are the pioneer in space travels. Then there is twitter. Elon will make that a very profitable company. Don't forget nuclear power. So Tesla is a mix of different businesses. Kind of a mutual fund. Like Berkshire Hathaway. I am keeping my tesla stocks and will add at every decline.",

Granted, Tesla does make compelling cars, but unlike people who never experienced something like a Porsche Taycan IRL won\u2019t understand why people would choose anything over Tesla now. The competition has caught up.\n\nI worked in car sales for a few years, and NYC\u2019s most prestigious dealer for exotic cars. The day I saw the Rimac IRL and experienced a launch on West Side Highway\u2026 I knew the party was ending soon. Sure the Rimac is an edge case car but then I started test driving Tesla\u2019s and noticed the subpar build quality first hand, and cancelled my order for a Tesla X and now I\u2019m leaning to Volvo for the wife.\n\nElon needs to pump the share price because his modus operandi is to throw cash at the engineering problems and deliver only just enough to keep the investors from fleeing. But Cybertruck is a vehicle far removed from reality and because he pitched it as the final product, he\u2019s now faced with the reality that he loses if he doesn\u2019t deliver what he promised in order to achieve a vehicle that makes sense, or make it as he advertised and get shafted by all the other criteria that define successful cars. Stainless Steel body which will be written off in any kind of collision that isn\u2019t superficial? Safety standards for pedestrians? These things exist.",

Compare that vehicle to Cybertruck and then factor in Chevy going full EV, Mercedes EQS, Lucid Air, Fisker Ocean, etc.",

Mix in how many vehicles they deliver quarterly. Elon\u2019s stock price is pure hype and Wall Street is more than happy to keep the narrative going by pumping the share price to guarantee they make off like bandits when the crows come home to roost and Tesla is no longer the king of EV\u2019s",

                                    "comment": "Hybrid cars are carbon footprint neutral or positive. E85 cars are less positive but still positive. Gas and electric cars are not carbon footprint neutral. I have a rare hybrid malibu that sold with a spec of 49 mile / g but my son programmed it so it goes as high as 98 mile/g. I calculated that at 2019 assuming 49/g the malibu hybrid drives at 3c/mile whereas tesla and all other full electric cars go like 6c/ mile. That too I am in a state where electricity is like 7c per KWH when the car charges. In CT where I am from it is 23c per kWH. Gas cost is higher in CT than even MA and NY but still it is not double like electricity cost. In CT the comparison will be like malibu hybrid 4c per mile vs tesla 12c per mile. With the tuning my son did it is like 1.5c per mile. My hybrid go 700 mile with a full gas tank of 14 g. No Electric vehicle will have that range. I have actually driven it to past 700 miles from carolinas to CT. If I refill again in 5 minutes I will drive back 700 miles. No comparison with electric cars. I don't know why GM and ford stopped making hybrid malibu and hybrid fusion. There is a TEDx presentation by a scientist that demonstrated electric cars are not even carbon neutral. They never recoup the environmental damage done to produce them. Only hybrid cars are environmentally positive with E85 cars to a lesser degree. So many countries have adopted e85 and hybrid cars. US will be run by big industrialists influencing policy. We are forcing asian car makers to switch from hybrid and e85 into electric. Asian governments and public policy makers know nothing of the subject? it is bizarre how we go for a policy with so much government subsidy. Please watch the TEDx lecture before fighting with me here.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1E8SQde5rk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1E8SQde5rk)",

In fact, it's the primary motivation behind why Woodrow Wilson wrote \"The Study of Administration\" https://ballotpedia.org/%22The_Study_of_Administration%22_by_Woodrow_Wilson_(1887)\n\nHe argues that Congress should dictate an overall framework which is then implemented by apolitical administrators in the executive branch who largely listen to domain experts in order to write regulations. From there, the will of the people is that of an \"authoritative critic\" of such administrators, but it's not micromanaging in the same way as having Congress do all the details. \n\nThis idea was influential and our federal government is largely structured this way now. It's essentially a workaround for having a highly dysfunctional Congress, and both parties have largely went along with it because it shifts the blame for bad decisions onto the executive. They can then run around and scream and yell and pass laws to \"fix\" things instead of get blamed for bad policy. \n\nThey'll likely not pass specific laws on AI, but instead have the executive appoint a bureaucrat to meet with tech leadership and discuss regulations. The tech companies will play nicely because it'll create red tape that prevents competitors from entering the market.",

    "postText": "Hello all, it's been a while. I'm sure there are a bunch of new faces around here and it has been 2 years since my one and only post in the subreddit so, before reading this post, please check out this one -\n\n[I singlehandedly saved the market by fading myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwpky1/i_singlehandedly_saved_the_market_by_fading_myself/)\n\nI've done it again, I saved the market. This post is a little overdue, but a few weeks ago I bought a single SPY put assuming that the debt ceiling would be hit and America would default on it's debts. Since I made that play, it, of course, did not happen. Now SPY is approaching ATHs and the American money machine is pumping. Inflation went down for the 11th straight month and is at its lowest point in years. The future is bright all because of 1 single SPY put.\n\nSome of you may be saying \"Well, that was a stupid play. It was never going to work! The government would never allow a default on their own debt, this guy is an idiot.\" To that I say, how sure are you? Would you bet your life on that? Perhaps the soul of your firstborn? I know this works because it happens time and time again, this was actually the first trade I've made since my last post. I sacrificed $10 so that you all could make $1000. I saved every American's retirement account, their kids college funds, and for what? Nothing. I am a simple man who seeks no thanks, I only search for the right thing to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u31oz576et5b1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b07f20c634cac74074f36f1999cc5fc997c4a27e",

    "postText": "The Cboe VIX is currently hovering around the 14,.. mark which is at least a new 3 year low. \nConsidering the fact that statistically speaking, there is a recession every few years, here\u2019s my plan: \n\nThe CBOE VIX all time low was on Friday the 3rd of November 2017 with a close at 9,14 and for this strategy I assume it to not get below a level of 9,0.\n(See the list below for the 20 lowest closing levels of the VIX)\n\nIf the VIX falls to a level of around 9,0 and you opened a long position at around a level of 14,\u2026 (aka now) your position will loose around 35% and therefore you would need a gain of 53,8% to recover your position and end up break even. \nBasically you need the VIX to get back to wherever you bought in to your position. \nHowever, during a time of market turmoil and uncertainty with the next recession waiting behind every singe door one could possibly open, it is to expect that the VIX will within the next few years spike to something between 40 to 60+, and even dough you may make a huge loss and see your position dead in the red for quite some time, there will be a day when the VIX skyrockets to the Moon and give you a 350%+ gain. \n\n\nThe list I was talking about: \n  20 lowest VIX closes:\n     Fri 03 Nov 2017 =  9.14\n     Wed 03 Jan 2018 =  9.15\n     Thu 05 Oct 2017 =  9.19\n     Thu 04 Jan 2018 =  9.22\n     Fri 05 Jan 2018 =  9.22\n     Wed 22 Dec 1993 =  9.31\n     Mon 11 Dec 2017 =  9.34\n     Fri 21 Jul 2017 =  9.36\n     Mon 06 Nov 2017 =  9.40\n     Fri 15 Dec 2017 =  9.42\n     Mon 24 Jul 2017 =  9.43\n     Tue 25 Jul 2017 =  9.43\n     Mon 02 Oct 2017 =  9.45\n     Thu 23 Dec 1993 =  9.48\n     Fri 29 Sep 2017 =  9.51\n     Fri 14 Jul 2017 =  9.51\n     Tue 03 Oct 2017 =  9.51\n     Mon 08 Jan 2018 =  9.52\n     Mon 18 Dec 2017 =  9.53\n     Thu 28 Sep 2017 =  9.55",

If the VIX spikes, I will close my short puts for pennies and then buy long puts. It\u2019s too hard to time a spike, but it\u2019s relatively easy to time when a spike will end (within days). At that moment, if it turns out that this is already priced into UVIX premiums, I will buy shares of SVIX or SVXY.",

Usually target around 10% gains. You could theoretically make much more with more aggressive strike/dte but I'm not going that hard since I full port it.\n\nIt's not a super common occurrence, last one I did was the bank crisis deal in March. But I made 5k in a day and called it good. \n\nThe one time it failed and I sold for about a 10% loss is because I got greedy and tried to double dip on the same spike.",

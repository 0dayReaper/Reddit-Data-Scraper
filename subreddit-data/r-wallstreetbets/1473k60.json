    "postText": "Some friends on the WallStreetBets discord group have been spamming for people to buy put options on construction company Lennar due to stocks of homegoods companies including Lowes, Home Depot performing poorly during earnings.\n\nHowever, due to lumber prices rising the past two weeks, Lennar's bottom line will not be affected until the next quarter. Lennar, which is being evaluated for Q2 results for current earnings, will likely benefit from relatively lower lumber prices when their construction was completed and profits were accrued and amortized in their ledgers. Lennar this quarter will likely be recognizing profits from constructions that were completed up to 1.5 years ago due to their accrual accounting method.\n\nLennar is both a home builder and housing mortgage originator similar to the way Citadel is a market maker and a hedge fund. Both companies contain conflict of interest entities and will likely be able to hide any signs of unprofitability through money shuffling between these entities. As a result, any unprofitability may likely be hidden for a long time until unfavorable macroeconomic headwinds expose their bottom lines or even cause slashing of dividends.\n\nBecause of their failure to do their due diligence, I have no choice but to buy 125 dollar strike Lennar call options expiring 06/16.",

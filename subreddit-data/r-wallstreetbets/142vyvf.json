Imagine being some poor CRE sucker that bought property in SF in 2021-2, you see this shit and fathom that your property value could very well be less than half of what you paid for it.",

The Pandemic slowed everything down. All violent crimes have either gone below pre Pandemic or stayed roughly flat. \n\nThe only crime to go up is shoplifting. And while that's an issue we need to address it hardly raises safety concerns.\n\nAnd before someone makes a claim of \"oh but they get violent when they shoplift.\". That would make it reported under violent crime. Which hasn't gone up. So it's not more likely.",

The Mayor who ran on defunding the police and liberal views is changing the tune with businesses and residents living due to crime and homelessness.\n\nAs for those numbers\u2026if you raise the loss level to $1000 as the law is $950 or more for charging someone with a misdemeanor, you don\u2019t count the people that know that limit and steal below it. \n\nHere is $1 million of losses broken down in two ways: \n\nIf you have 1,000 people steal $1000 goods and get caught and charged; that is 1000 \u201ccrimes\u201d on the book\u2026\n\nCalifornia has it as a misdemeanor which is not worth the DAs time. Yes it\u2019s $950 but rounding up for the sake\u2026\n\nIf you have 2,000 people steal $500 of goods, there would be no bookings, so there are no \u201ccrimes\u201d on the book. \n\nSimple liberal math\u2026when businesses are closing down due to crime, it\u2019s best to take their word for it than a liberal mayor and cooked data\u2026",

Prices only get a little exorbitant once in Marin county, and any of the hotels in or near the Sonoma and Napa wine areas. If the rates went any higher, people would just stay in Millbrae or Burlingame and take BART into the city or drive 20-40 mins to get anywhere in the city. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they didn\u2019t make enough to cover their costs, or margins were razor thin.",

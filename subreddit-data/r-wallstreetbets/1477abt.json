    "postText": "**Recap On Last Weeks Market Action:**\n\n* SPY closed up 0.46%\n* QQQ closed down 0.04%\n* Dow Jones Industrial closed up 0.34%\n* VIX closed down 5.27%\n\nGood evening everyone, I hope you all doing well and enjoying the weekend. This past week we saw sideways action in the major indices but several individual stocks still made decent advances. Upcoming announcements this week are the May CPI numbers at 8:30 am Tuesday followed by the FOMC statement and press conference at 2 pm and 2:30 pm on Wednesday, respectively. Long term outlooks for the market are still currently bullish, however, in the short term it may serve well to be cautious with two big announcements coming out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhv63ortrg5b1.png?width=2273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f267e4ae6719ea421c69a94b8e59ed5e88e84432\n\nSPY has been advancing nicely over the past few trading days. Last week price was mostly range bound but saw an attempt to go higher on Friday. This price push ran right up to highs from August 2022 and quickly retreated. I would have liked to have seen a stronger close but, it would not e the worst thing if we went sideways here and then broke out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ero8wqourg5b1.png?width=2263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=23551ca9229771aac109b2d4703fdeef4f483cc2\n\nQQQ is acting similarly to SPY, we saw price run up to a level not seen since April 2022 and then retreat. It would be even more constructive for QQQ to trade sideways here as many mega-cap stocks that make up QQQ have had huge moves and are somewhat extended.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j313embvrg5b1.png?width=2266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=426758a00243d0b692696326535e3bbddef8ebf2\n\nARKK is a disruptive technology ETF that is basing around $43.90. The 8, 21, and 50 day EMA are all trending upwards and the 200 day EMA looks like it is starting to curl up as well. There are several tailbars near the breakout point which tells us that there are big sellers there. ARKK will need alot of buying support to be able to push past the selling. If this starts to rise above the base I would look for heavy volume to indicate buying power.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mef2ruvrg5b1.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ae99ad517112729b4ff032c58a78d30f59a0e249\n\nARKW is a software ETF and is behaving similarly to ARKK. The tailbars at the base breakout are not as extreme but are still going to require a god amount of buying to push through.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e043kgwrg5b1.png?width=2271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=34cf4646dc664b51518cff6cb080217976ee7a64\n\nCLOU is a cloud computing ETF and is approaching a year long downward sloping trendline. Price is a bit extended now so sideways action would be beneficial. However, if a larger market rally occurs, this could lift and have a buy point above Thursdays highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/81rzm6kxrg5b1.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=794771cb3b0732434000bcdf8bb2407f39878674\n\nHACK is a cybersecurity ETF with a buy price of $49.60. This is a base on base formation where it broke out of a lower base and began to form another base right on top. There was big selling earlier this week and that is something to keep in mind.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvulpji0sg5b1.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=59a591cbf00820e41c25206067c3a4a9002dfedb\n\nIJH a mid-cap ETF was on the list last week and broke out. It appears to be bouncing off of its original base formation. If that is the case a buy point would be taking out the weekly highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt709b61sg5b1.png?width=2280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0cc63cbf818c90360d8423e94b5b56f4cefb5240\n\nKRE is a regional banking ETF that has been hammered by recent bank collapses. It is forming what could be a cup with handle with a buy price of $45.04. Personally, even if this triggers, I would not consider buying this. This ETF is very news driven and can easily take another nose dive if there is bad news.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2oskm1q1sg5b1.png?width=2267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=877130c8014df622be4917674db9377687238b83\n\nTNA is a small cap ETF which was also on the list last week that broke out. It pushed above the base and 200 day EMA on heavy volume and then pulled back on slightly lower volume. I like how the 200 day EMA is currently supporting price as well. This is also a bounce scenario with a buy taking out the weekly highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tg3y4b2sg5b1.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=193b9829d1a13c1df13a2b2cd05f7e5fd77c5022\n\nLastly, we have URA, an ETF that tracks the price of uranium. URA is right at it base and had good buying support on Friday, although I would have liked to have seen more volume. This ETF has had to move quite a bit to get to the base so it may pause here. A buy point could be when price takes out the weekly highs.\n\nThe market has posted some decent gains over the past few weeks. We have also seen broader market participation, meaning that it is not just a select few stocks driving the indices higher. There are many ETFs and individual stocks that forming nice bases with clear buy points. However, this is still a choppy market that can be driven by news. With two big announcements this week, I would not be surprised if we traded sideways until after the news came out. Essentially, be cautious, but also ready to make new buys if the markets begins to push decisively higher.\n\nAs always you should conduct your own research before making any sort of investment.\n\nIf you have any comments or question on what is discussed in the article or otherwise please feel free to reach out!",

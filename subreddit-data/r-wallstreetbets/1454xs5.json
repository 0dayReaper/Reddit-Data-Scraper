The Star Wars hotel was a dinky building smaller than a warehouse that had a max occupancy of like 300 people.  No one knows how much it cost to build and maintain, but estimates are on the very, very, very low side.  Everyone on the inside always called it a fun experiment and nothing more.  Disney Plus losing the India subscribers, meh, sounds worse than it is.  I think analyst said they lost 6 figures in the West and were more concerned about that.\n\nMovies turn to shit, sure.  So all this comes to movies being shit.  As we saw from Mario Movie and Spiderverse, there's still tremendous money and power out there in animation/film.  All it will take is Disney to take one of their random IPs seriously.  They can do that... I think... Maybe?  So I wouldn't bet against them.  \n\nDisney is one of those companies where just one random trailer of them showing that they really care again about their IP can gape the shorts.  I don't mess with it.",

She singlehandedly drove the proverbial spike through the modern equivalent of the story of the Trojan War. If she is not gone from Disney or if Lucas Films isn't sold off I don't see how they they don't sink ship shortly after IJ5 hits theaters. \n\nThe sharks are circling.\n\nI'd be looking at Universal, Sony and even Daily wire to eat their lunch in the coming couple of years. Nintendo even.\n\nShort term I can see stock dropping to $75, maybe even $50, but I'd bet long term things will change and it will rebound... but not before a lot of very competent people create new things inside Disney or are aquired by Disney. That is impossible in today's us vs them political climate, and even more so with the writer's strike.\n\nThere's still the rumor of bad investments in crypto that could result in Igor being jailed, but he strikes me much as the Clinton type of politician, and even if true, he may yet worm his way up.\n\nBut who knows.",

Now the advantage Warner Bros, Disney, Paramount, MGM, have is in the actual making of movies and marketing. \n\nWhen these old studios want to make a movie they can go to the lot and shoot there. When they need costumes, props, backgrounds, they can go to the warehouse and reuse old materials used in other films. \n\nIt\u2019s prestigious to work with certain directors and certain studios. So talent will work cheaper than for Netflix or Amazon who still need to prove they can succeed on a basis of quality. \n\nThe old studios have been making movies forever. They know how to do it. They have a mountain of resources from distribution, IP, props/stage/lighting/relationships, to marketing. It\u2019s a huge advantage. \n\nNetflix was first but after COVID there was a huge push from demand to release all these other services. Paid and unpaid streaming services. They predictable are into market share. \n\nSo the only way for Amazon and Netflix to remain competitive was to make their own content. Most of it is turn and burn. Some is quite good. Production value is spotty. Talent is expensive for them to attract. Just a lot of challenges. But it all comes down to content generation now.",

Technically they should have competition from DC but those guys suck more than anything that's ever sucked before so Marvel is pretty much the only game in town.\n\n\n Their streaming platform is technically great, with tons of great content. Their Star Wars shows have been really impressive and almost made me forget the recent movies (except Rogue One because Rogue One rocked.my world)\n\n\nTheir theme parks are second to none (well, I do have a soft spot for Universal Hollywood but that's because I'm a film geek). I go several times a year. The Rise of the Resistance ride is the best in the world bar none. Just the introduction, the spaceship trip you take before you actually board the ride itself, could be its own ride. The new Spiderman ride is awesome as well. Also, they have a Pandora area at Disney World. I'm not a fan (at all) but the success of Avatar 2 probably renewed some of the interest \n\n\n\nDisney always has some stuff going. Not everything is going to succeed (see Star Wars hotel) but there's always new stuff. In the short term, the stock could go down but long term, they're going to remain dominant in the entertainment space",

So for the past year with no money on hands, the politicians decided would be better to ask for money to other country, since we are almost there at the end of the period, and they dont want to cut expenses. And China had been \"good\" giving money in exchange for natural resources of which we have plenty. So 2 candidates of the opposition party are proposing to set dollar as currency or to dolarize economy.",

Macri shoehorned the IMF deal in knowing it was political suicide because the country in general has a poor perception of the IMF from previous lending programs. The deal forced Macri to implement too many austerity measures when the economy was contracting due to a lack of investment because companies knew he was on his way out and Alberto would be hostile to foreign companies/investment. \n\nKeynesian economics pretty much states that the worst time to implement austerity measures is when your economy is already contracting. Although yes, austerity and reducing public spending and subsidies would've eventually been necessary. Sadly their whole populace is addicted to those subsidies and everyone complains when they go away or get reduced.",

They will be wrecked. Isn\u2019t that one of the lessons we learned from Spain and Greece after 2008?\n\nThis seems crazy.",

That means 8.5 out of every 10 BEVs sold in Europe is not a Tesla and 9 out of every 10 BEVs sold in China is not a Tesla. That doesn't happen without competition. There's demand for EVs in those regions and other autos have filled that demand. US market share has dropped to 50% but remains high due to low adoption rates relative to Europe and China. Just because no single company is making more cars on their own than Tesla doesn't mean there isn't a ton of competition. The US is only one of Tesla's markets.",

Governments have Mandated a transition to EVs so autos have no choice but to scale up production to meet government regulations. There are an insane number of battery manufacturing plants and BEV manufacturing plants currently under construction in the US right now. Everyone wants a piece of the Biden EV and battery handouts.

Ford never established a monopoly. And now they're an average sized player making less than half the vehicles per year that VW and Toyota do. Further, I would also argue that automobiles are transforming now its not an entirely new product. It's a new power train. There are many established automotive companies that have the resources to make the transition, unlike in the early days of automotive development. 80-90% of the vehicle remains roughly the same technology wise. Chassis, suspension, interiors, body panels, etc. And the major difference is the batteries which everyone will be sourcing from the same major players. CATL, BYD, Panasonic, LG, etc. Electric motors have been around for centuries there's no moat there either. This is all about scale and there are no technology moats in EVs right now.",

Congrats on no return the past 2.5 years because you don't understand when to take your wins. Expect to continue to under perform tech the next 10 years. You'll learn that past performance is not indicator of future performance the hard way. Tesla benefited from the Fed money printer pumping speculative growth stocks, 0% rates and auto supply chain issues driving up new car prices. Now comes the margin compression, normal interest rate environment and supply demand balance in autos to take it all back. I bet you're one of those Cathie Woods types who think TSLA is going to $6000 a share by 2027.",

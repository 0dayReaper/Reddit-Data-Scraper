Maybe it'll go up 100% this market is stupid, and in a state of utter euphoria, it's a new paradigm.. Expensive car prices are 200% the result of 0% loans, since most people finance them. If you look at the average loan calculation nowadays, it's not uncommon for it to add like 10k loaning money at the current interest rate. This means the prices go down, and dealers make less, since they mostly sell based on the bi-weekly payment number to consumers that don't understand finance that well.",

I'm Canadian but I think they cost about the same in USD/CAD which makes them more expensive in the states. Interest rates are always higher on used vehicles since it's more risk to the bank, so there's even less credibility on your thesis they are worth more. With that logic I'll buy a new car and sell it for 20-30k more in a year or two, like covid is still happening and we don't make new ones.",

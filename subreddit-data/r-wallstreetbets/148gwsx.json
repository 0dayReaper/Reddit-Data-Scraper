    "postText": "Main points from the article:\n\n&gt;A recent survey conducted by Yahoo Finance/Ipsos reveals that a significant majority of investors, 66% to be precise, are reluctant to utilize AI financial advisors. Furthermore, almost half of the respondents, 46%, express a lack of trust in AI when it comes to providing financial advice. Interestingly, despite these concerns, there is a noteworthy 20% of investors who remain open to the idea of using AI advisors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;However, what investors may not realize is that AI is already being employed in their financial decision-making processes. Digitally-native personal finance management tools such as Mint and NerdWallet, which inherently require machine learning and AI for efficient operation, are already leveraging AI behind the scenes. Similarly, robo-advisors, which offer automated, algorithm-based portfolio management services to investors, are powered by AI. In fact, robo-advisors are projected to manage a staggering $2.76 trillion in assets this year, highlighting the significant role of AI in this domain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Moreover, AI plays a crucial part in other aspects of finance as well. Algorithmic trading and investment analysis heavily rely on AI capabilities. Although humans make the final decisions, AI assists in gathering and analyzing the vast amounts of data that inform these decisions.\n\n[AI: 20% of investors say they've used an AI chatbot, Yahoo Finance-Ipsos poll finds](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-20-of-investors-say-theyve-used-an-ai-chatbot-yahoo-finance-ipsos-poll-finds-130020135.html)",

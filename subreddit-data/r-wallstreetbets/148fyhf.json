    "postText": "Thoughts on LAZR becoming the undisputed underdog to take on Tesla? The company has announced a flurry of news, which includes the reveal of its new Iris+ sensor and associated software, which Mercedes-Benz is integrating into its next generation vehicle lineup. Luminar is also unveiling its product roadmap, several new exclusive commercial agreements, the acquisition of Seagate\u2019s lidar-related assets, Luminar Semiconductor subsidiary, and a new insurance initiative in partnership with Swiss Re to reduce insurance cost for vehicles equipped with Luminar.",

However, Tesla is still the undisputed leader in this area right now. Luminar will need to continue executing well and getting more partnerships with big names like Mercedes-Benz if they want to close the gap on Tesla.",

For anyone to catch up to Tesla they would have had to drop the ball and self sabotage themselves.... I mean they convinced a bunch of people to pay them thousands of dollars to test unfinished software.... so not only do they have all these testers and all this data, but they are getting paid for it as well. It's quite the racket.",

Sales haven't faired well either. And now they enter the price war with $4000 price cuts. They make some amazing motors, beautiful cars, nice brand, battery swap is really good. But the competition is so fierce, literally 100s of manufacturers in China, competition from Tesla, BYD, SAIC, VW. It's very tough. I believe they can survive and be a top brand out of China along with xpeng, li auto, BYD. But for now times are extremely tough.",

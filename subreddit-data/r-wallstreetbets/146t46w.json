    "postText": "**INTRO**\n\n \n\nListen, I am aware that half of the people here are genuine gambling addicts, convincing themselves that 0dtes are somehow different from hitting the bookies. I also understand that the average WSB user recoils at the mere suggestion of \"long-term investing.\" However, I hope to convince you that, just this once, an opportunity might lie on the Euronext instead of the NYSE, even though it may be considered a cardinal sin by many, perhaps even greater than buying and holding index funds.\n\n**FYI:** This is my first DD POST, so please excuse the formatting and shit grammar. To clarify my position, I have been holding a significant number of shares of BESI for the past five years. Recently, I sold about half of my position to secure profits as I reassess my short and long-term thesis. \n\n**TL;DR:** BESI is a semiconductor stock in the Netherlands that specializes in die attach and assembly. It shows great potential for the future, with an extremely bullish long-term outlook, while possibly being bearish in the short term as we approach the earnings report on July 27th.\n\n**What is BESI?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fm7c8owrwd5b1.png?width=357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2e8885b9956f125d9ae20c9a13853fe2e25a765f\n\nTo begin, let's understand what BESI actually does. BESI is a manufacturer of semiconductor assembly and packaging equipment. In simpler terms, they produce machines used to make various types of chips found in your tech devices. They operate in a wide range of industries, including electronics, mobile internet, cloud servers, computing, automotive, industrial, LED, and solar energy. Mobile technology is their primary focus.\n\nHeadquartered in the Netherlands, BESI has manufacturing locations across Asia, Europe, and the US. They also plan to expand further into Vietnam, following the trend of semiconductor manufacturing shifting away from China after a decline in productivity due to COVID-19. \n\nBESI specializes in die attach, packaging, and plating, which are crucial aspects of semiconductor manufacturing. Currently, BESI is the leading company in the die attach market, as shown below.\n\n[Besi has a 40&amp;#37; market share of the Die Attach market and is their main profit maker ](https://preview.redd.it/pvkx0drtwd5b1.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d6a4a32fa895e73bdf556011e8f0ef15d78e9e9)\n\nBESI's customers include some of the world's largest tech companies and since they have such a large market share if you look under the hood of your mobile devices, graphics cards, and hell even actually under the hood of your Car then you'll find at least some semiconductors, if not a majority, have in some part been produced via one of Besi's many Machines that they manufacture.   \n\n\n(speculation warning)  \nIt is worth noting that in the semiconductor industry, large and important customers often deal through subcontractors to maintain secrecy and mitigate the risk of corporate espionage. During investor presentations, and actual conversations I have personally had with Besi personnel at these presentations they mention names like Apple and Nvidia, and even listed Foxconn as a subcontractor, providing further evidence to support the theory that Apple is also a customer. \n\n[A List of their confirmed customers as well as their subcontractors so you can speculate yourself  ](https://preview.redd.it/t0qr8d60xd5b1.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f07d7f3640d4ea1e9941b6543e4ea02e211f1eac)\n\n**MACRO**\n\nDie attach is currently BESI's core business and primary profit driver. However, industry forecasts suggest that 2023 will be a slower year for semiconductor companies, which could result in an overall decrease in profits. Nonetheless, future projections indicate that around 2024, the next cycle of growth is expected to begin. .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwpmlee3xd5b1.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3cde187f45e18d6c2e346186e90761f1538bebf2\n\nIf you've been following developments in the semiconductor industry, you've likely come across the concept of hybrid bonding. Almost every semiconductor company is heavily investing in this technology as the next major advancement. BESI is also focusing on hybrid bonding and has started producing hybrid bonding machines. As the customer base for hybrid bonding grows, BESI can expect an increase in orders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Besi Already starting to get into HB machine production, poised to grow signicantly if they do well](https://preview.redd.it/kixec204xd5b1.png?width=1228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eebd3b4d2a35b038d654b76d2680ada8076fb1e6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMD has already started planning to incorporate HB in several of their chiplines, there is real potential for a large customer base here if BESI nails this](https://preview.redd.it/479n19o4xd5b1.png?width=1273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=963356e04701300a0ab447e445f6bbf5dbc5c572)\n\n AMD, for example, has already begun planning to incorporate hybrid bonding in several of their chip lines. This presents a significant opportunity for BESI to expand its customer base. Additionally, AMD has been announcing more products that require advanced process steps and a higher number of die placements in their EPYC line of chips. This trend indicates that as chips become more advanced, companies like BESI stand to profit further. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykp2qmjcxd5b1.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=beb23035a25d57e0a7f2374cc6e3b8f9ff021bd4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Their Numbers**\n\nTo start the Balance sheet numbers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v67ic5hmxd5b1.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d536b9187f056935703a774496d19bcdff49928f\n\nLet's delve further into BESI's balance sheet numbers. As shown, BESI has captured a significant portion of the die attach market, which has been steadily growing. Although other aspects of their business have been fluctuating, they still maintain a considerable market share in the various fields they serve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqt9nzhoxd5b1.png?width=1120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c045ea82bf795c338671b57d39224a62a994cee9\n\nOver the years, BESI has demonstrated solid profit efficacy and margin while remaining relatively cost-effective to run, indicating strong financial performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lavw0aapxd5b1.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=991fcc5501c733e9dfcdb7e423fcdfcedbc0aeca\n\nBESI boasts a substantial cash reserve that far exceeds their debt, providing them with a robust liquidity base.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxmwwr6qxd5b1.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=09b6e40fd69d23797acf52e37cc4e4de808258ef\n\nWhats also important to note that this october BESI is finishing its 300 Million euro Share buyback program, They purchased \\~3.5 million shares already through may-23 for \u20ac 222.1 million.\n\n**Aren't they near ATH right now after a huge bull run?**\n\nYou might be wondering if BESI is currently trading near its all-time high (ATH) after experiencing a significant bull run. Indeed, BESI has performed remarkably well since the March 2020 crash. Just recently, the stock reached an ATH of 104 euros per share but subsequently fell to 94 euros. This drop is precisely why I am presenting this DD now, as I expect it to continue falling at least by a few euro further. Analysts also have forecasted a slowdown in semiconductor market growth for 2023, as the largest spenders in the industry reduce their total expenses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[forecasting a slow in growth in the semiconductor market](https://preview.redd.it/56ghuewqxd5b1.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2cedf5f2d50a091d7d3be542f51386039a6c81d3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It's crucial to recognize that BESI operates as a cyclical company. Typically, the third and fourth quarters witness a surge in orders as companies manufacture new products for release. On the other hand, the first and second quarters experience a lower influx of orders. \n\n**My Thesis:**\n\nConsidering all the factors discussed, I anticipate that BESI will post mediocre to average earnings on July 27th, and I am even slightly bearish in the short term leading up to the earnings release. Consequently, I have adjusted my position to hold only about half of my original shares in the past few weeks. If BESI continues to decline in the coming weeks, my plan is to purchase more shares, bringing my holdings back to approximately 75% of my original position.\n\nHowever, in the long term, BESI is well-positioned to continue dominating the die attach market. As semiconductor chips become more advanced, BESI stands to profit even more. Additionally, the growth of hybrid bonding and advanced placement technologies presents further opportunities. BESI already has machines in development for both areas.\n\nI am curious to hear your thoughts on this analysis as well.",

In fact they even provide a great example of how prevalent BESI's Die attach machines actually are and I've attached it below (though this is of course a bit of a biased sample). But you can see how many of Besi's machines actually are involved in the process of making these chips.\n\nSemiconductor companies are extremely secretive both about their technology and their general customers for a reason.  Just because they dont publicly broadcast deals doesn't mean they dont exist. 40% market share of just normal Die attach is a lot, 70% market share of Advanced Die placement is crazy.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/us65hbkn9g5b1.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=61ef61fb355838dd3fe913cc540afba277aceb43",

This business has low barriers to entry and is waiting to be chewed up by lower cost competition.\n\nBuy ASML, or ASMI or a property semiconductor equipment company.",

Nor do you seem to have the ability to read, packaging and plating literally only makes up 20% of their revenue as it quite literally states. Die Attach is their bread and butter, if you think that is making the packaging wherein they sit I recommend you go read up on the field and come back.   \n\nAlso what evidence do you have to suggest that its one of the lowest quality in the field? Die attach is an extremely important bottle neck of the semiconductor supply chain and they are by and far the largest company that specializes in Die attach. They have quite a significant lead in comparison to their other relevant competitors in the field. \n\nYour R&amp;D % is also just straight up wrong if you check their latest Quarterly report, and in comparison to their competitors they are indeed spending more on R&amp;D too. They're also literally starting to make and test  hybrid bonding machines already with customers. If they get it right (as they have been doing the past 5 or so years with Die attach and more) then they stand to gain massively.   \n\n\nRegardless no one is saying that THIS IS the next semiconductor company like ASML or TSMC, rather that it is a huge player in one of of the bottlenecks of the supply chain wherein they have a marginal lead on all other competitors.",

If they do ramp it up, then your profit margins are structurally lower than you suggest.\n\nHalf what most semiconductor companies spend... because this is a low tech business. \n\n\"Die Attach is also commonly known in the Semiconductor industry as Die Bonding or Die Mount. It is the process of attaching a silicon chip to the Die pad of the support structure, such as a leadframe or metal can header of the Semiconductor package\"...  attach the semiconducyor SOMEONE ELSE HAS MADE to packaging.

Them mfs gotta make machines that are accurate at placing to the tiniest of measurements. Also that is quite literally what \"making\" a semiconductor is, you think the wafer just has everything already placed on it when ASML or TSMC is done with their part of the supply chain? \n\nHybrid bonding is also on every semiconductors radar\n\nGenuinely crazy that you guys will argue this when you barely understand what Die attach is or how vital it is in the supply chain of semiconductors.",

ASML and ASMI are trying to get things to work at the tiniest of nanometers with machines that are the size of buses and cost 100s of millions.\n\nDie attach is low quality, relatively commoditised work in comparison. That is why the space has about 10 operators in it.",

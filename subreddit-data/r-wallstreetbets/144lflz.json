Doesn't look like you've been getting infinite returns the last couple years.\n\nIn late October 2021 right before it peaked at $400 you were posting about how it was going to 3T.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhlhcs/we\\_may\\_need\\_to\\_start\\_thinking\\_about\\_tesla\\_at\\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhlhcs/we_may_need_to_start_thinking_about_tesla_at_3/)\n\nLooks like you were late to the party and got a little too ahead of yourself.

Companies I've worked for don't have stock, so the salary us about the best they can offer.\n\nIt seems almost everywhere I go at least one or two people on the team have been there twice as long as everyone else and make less because they only get .50c to $1 raises.

You're completely correct. Gotta job hop or get that promotion to get a bump - that's just the way it goes. There's only so many promotions but there are a *lot* of other companies lol.\n\nI've been at my new spot for 1 year ish and some change. Fully remote and the work isn't too difficult. I love it. But come year 2? No big salary or promotion bump? Damn, it's gonna suck to leave lmao.",

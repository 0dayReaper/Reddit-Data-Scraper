    "postText": "Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities raised its price target to $109 from $93 ahead of the results, and over the weekend, Wolfe Research upgraded the shares to \"outperform from \"peer perform,\" citing tailwinds related to artificial intelligence (AI). Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 23 upward revisions and 0 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 11 downward.\n\nORCL has finished three of its past eight post-earnings sessions higher, including a 10.4% pop last June. This time around, options traders are pricing in a next-day swing of 12.6%, regardless of direction, which is higher than the 5.2% move the stock has averaged over the past two years. \n\nThe Cerner deal (mentioned earlier) from 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, had boosted revenue estimates for ORCL, but also said that it had had a lagging effect on earnings per share. It's expected to have bolstered the company\u2019s position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services. For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% at cc and from 49% to 51% in USD.\n\nORCL's cloud results will also no doubt be closely watched. ORCL is a distant fourth in the cloud computing market behind Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG), but brokerages such as Guggenheim have highlighted the benefits from such a position.\n\nAccelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and the company\u2019s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL\u2019s quarterly performance.\n\nOracle announced on May 18 that it would join the Scheduling Standards Consortium to boost logistical effectiveness. The company's ERP division may have benefited from the move of many sizable SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and rising deal success in a number of industries, including banking and healthcare.\n\nThe strong uptake of Oracle's Dedicated Region Cloud and next-generation Autonomous Database, underpinned by machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, may have helped the bottom line. Gen2 public cloud architecture is seeing significant momentum for autonomous databases.\n\nIt's increasingly obvious that calls are going to be the play for this one. I'm going to buy the 120c for 3.60 and sell the 125c for 2.30. This means I can get the spread for $130 and potentially make 3.8x gains on this one. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.\n\nEdit: My account has been banned for a single comment I've posted unrelated to /r/wallstreetbets on another subreddit.

That means you need to make it almost all up on the stock price. Implied move I think was around 10%, and it only moved 6%. If you bought prior to today, you probably sold ahead of ER and didn\u2019t overstay your welcome and appreciated the Oracle gods.",

            "comment": "**$ORCL earnings play (post mortem)**  \nLots of ways to win on this one. Always easier in hinesight. \n\n**Pre-ER Straddle/Strangle**  \nLooks like if you purchased an $ORCL strangle/straddle prior to the recent run out that would have printed. If you bought yesterday, who ever sold you those call options did a little bit of a happy dance today.  Looks like $ORCL held $120-$121 for a little bit, enough time to sell those call options. If you went with the C110, which last Thursday was at the money, that would have went from $2 -&gt; $12 (selling at 9:45AM). If you did that in a reasonable straddle or strangle, you costs to enter the position would have been about $6. That would return about +100%. \n\n**Post-ER Scalping (1 Trade)**\n\nIf you were in a post-ER scalping mood, you would have picked up the $118 PUT around 10AM, and rode that like the 1 trick pony it was all day long. 10AM price about $1. 4PM price about $2.45. Which would have been a nice +136% for relatively little work.\n\n  \n**Post-ER Scaling (3 Trades)**  \nIf you were in a post-ER day scalping day trade mood, you would have picked it up through some of the drop offs, get caught in a few minor spikes, but ultimately be a winner on the day. (+14%).  \nTrade 1: 10:18 -&gt; 12:43 (P118 -- +24%)  \nTrade 2: 13:19 -&gt; 14:15 (C120) -- -34%)  \nTrade 3: 14:45 -&gt; 15:52 (P118 -- +24%)",

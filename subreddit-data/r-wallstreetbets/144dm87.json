Yes shorters will have to close their positions when the stock rallies 50-100-200% but then it's only up because some regard bought it at that high premium. When the shorts are closed, a continued rally only means a bag holder passing the bag.\n\nGL yall squeezing these evil wallstreets. In reality yall just squeezing each other :)\n\nThe post got banned because it's literally my first post and I have offended some admin's lack of reading skills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Short interest gets reported biweekly. Whatever it is the short interest on your favorite symbol today, [will be published on June 29th](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest), 20 days from now.

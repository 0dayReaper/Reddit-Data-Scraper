They care about the future and what they can figure out about the future from the information they're getting today.\n\nIn particular good news is very bad right now at scale because it heralds rate increases that stand to significantly increase the likelyhood of a future failure.\n\nLikewise it creates the impression that inflation could be a much, MUCH more serious problem than people are giving it credit for and if rates have to be hiked much higher to get it under control it is going to start risking huge sections of the market that basically cannot function with expensive credit.  Hyperinflation is having to have rates be 12%+ to control inflation just as much as it can be trying to figure out how you use these new 2 billion dollar bills to buy a hamburger.",

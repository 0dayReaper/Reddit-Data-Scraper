But I think I can crunch the numbers. These guys trade at 2x sales. CEO owns about 42% of the float, that is some big balls confidence. Institutions owns another 25M shares. Which makes NRDS with an incredibly small float. We are talking about under 19M shares available to trade. This is too good to be true right? Momentum can mirror UPST and that is already a 3 bagger from the bottom. This has the potential to move faster than SOFI too (sorry NOTO).\n\nTLDR; ticker: NRDS, tiny float, CEO and institutions owns over 50%, big gains.\n\nLETS GO NERDS - I own 10,000 shares",

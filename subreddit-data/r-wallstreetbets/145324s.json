The amount of total infrastructure relative to the low population is so skewed that they have difficulty raising the tax revenue necessary to run the city. \n\nIt's a difficult trap to be in. They'd like to attract more people in order to raise revenue, but the high rates are a deterrent. Lowering the rate would see declines in city services which would also be a deterrent.

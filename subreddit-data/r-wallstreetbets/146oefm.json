I get charged zero interest, but every month I get a couple hundred bucks in cashback automatically. I particularly like the Fidelity card because it's so simple, it's 2% back and automatically splits that 50/50 into the kids 529 college savings accounts, so easy! My other favorite card is my Amazon card, just because we spend SO MUCH on Amazon (usually around $25k/yr), and it gives 5% cash back, and some items and some sales give 10% cash back.",

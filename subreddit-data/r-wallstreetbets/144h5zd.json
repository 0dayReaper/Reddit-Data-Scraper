    "postText": "Both are $3500. (Technically Apple's is $1 cheaper) \nBoth are the same class of headset that utilizes both AR and VR technology.\nMicrosoft's HoloLens 2 is marketed mainly towards Professionals and isn't Mass Produced for the regular Consumer Retail market. Whereas Apple's Vision Pro headset will be Mass Produced  headset with the same capabilities if not more than than the HoloLens, for the regular Consumer market, will probably be in stores to test out, etc.\n\nWho do you think will sell more? An AR/VR headset with the Apple name and OS or Microsoft's?\n\nAgain they are the same price, so it's honestly not expensive in comparison.",

Microsoft's holographic display is something totally different that uses light prisms to display objects in 3d space using kinect-like room-mapping algorithms. \n\nApple doesn't try to do any of that it's just a VR display with an opaqueness setting. Also microsoft already sold thousands of units to the military for research and testing in mixed reality combat training. \n\nI'll reserve judgement on which approach is better until Vision Pro comes out but Hololens is firmly \"pro\" product and apple's is sorta \"prosumer.\"",

In many cases the software relies on x86 specific hardware such a AVX extensions and can't realistically be ported. Most third party professional  hardware (eg GPU, pen plotters etc ) lack ARM drivers and is very unlikely to ever supported.\n\nThe M Series processors are not particularly fastl (mid-range CPU with integrated graphics) unless the software has been specifically written to use the graphics cores.

Among many other things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevermind the software compatibility. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMS's design is pure AR and gains the benefits of that. Apple's is a compromise design. (And having a hololens myself, it's comparable to an oculus in the color/brightness areas once you factor in the fact that it's a pure passthrough AR system compatible with the user's glasses and headset/hardpoint mounting).  Even just using regular desktop applications with a BT KB/mouse to replace having monitors, it's great and the applications are just as opaque or not as I need them.",

Hell, half their presentation was about uses for content creators, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrosoft's has a great app ecosystem, if you are referring to it in the same way that the apple one has the iOS app store as well.

There will probably be a cheaper consumer/home user version later on, but it's blatently advertised to commercial sectors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut not the same commercial sectors hololens targets. And not even remotely the same capabilities/platform/software/etc. Hololens is a full W10/11 computer in the headset with all that entails - from management to software capabilities etc. Apple's is an iPad strapped to your head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, try mounting apple's on a hardhat well in a construction/industrial area.... we use hololenses in one business unit to inspect steel panels for ship construction, for example. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple's is just Hololens 2 with a few tweaks and far less software capabilites - sure, maybe a bit more sensor and display resolution, but the display is entirely different and suits different purposes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut apple is definitely not targeting consumers with this one. Will it be used by consumers? Sure, the same way I use my hololens like a consumer product (just with far more useful software). Will that be a minority? hell yes. Will it be able to entirely replace my work computer like a hololens does and give me unlimited screen real estate and the ability to leave software and other things in different rooms (I've forgotten which room i've left SSH sessions in before, lol.....) and let me do the same work? Well, if you can do everything for work on an iPad without remoting to another machine to run applications (not say, configure a server and/or push/run test scripts), then yes. Otherwise, hell no.",

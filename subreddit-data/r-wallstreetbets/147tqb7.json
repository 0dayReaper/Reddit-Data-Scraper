    "postText": "Delta airlines and the industry are back.\nWith business travel well on pace for a full recovery, it is defying some predictions\u00a0that it would take until at least 2024 for a complete comeback. Leisure travel has already regained its full strength, showcasing a robust resurgence in the sector. So why the beaten down share price?\n\nImproved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, should be aiding Delta. Given this positive, DAL anticipates earnings per share for full-year 2023 between $5 and $6. Total revenues (adjusted) are expected to increase in the 15-20% range on a year over year basis\u2026 and on track to surpass 2019 levels (pre-COIVD).\n\nFree cash flow of more than $2 billion is expected in 2023. Operating margin for 2023 is expected in the 10-12% range. DAL's liquidity position is an added positive. These numbers are off-the-charts, and likely to get a lot of attention come July when they release financials.\n\nOn the flip side, yes\u2026higher fuel prices can impact DAL's bottom line. However, DAL expects June quarter's earnings per share to be $2 - $2.25; which is well above levels seen in years.\n\nDAL current share price is currently below expectations for the year and is very undervalued. Any wrinkled brains have any wisdom to share on DAL?\n\nTL;DR; DAL fundamentals appear strong. Price targets and EPS expectations are high. Valuation is remarkably low. YOLO?",

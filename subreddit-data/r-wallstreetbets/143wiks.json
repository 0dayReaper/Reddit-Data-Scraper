The Mayor\u2019s Office of Special Enforcement did not respond to\u00a0Forbes\u2019 request for comment.\n-from the article you asked if people read\n\nNow the little guy from the company essentially vouching for AirBnB said that them being in the market doesn't mess up the market but like, of course thats his position right?",

That\u2019s kind of the whole point of owning a house. \n\nLmfao you dumb idiot. You do understand that that\u2019s the same logic the investment companies and foreign entities are using, right? \n\nAnd if you believe the whole point of owning property is so you can rent that property out to other people, congrats on your shitty conscience. \n\nThe whole point of owning property is it\u2019s the only way to cover the shelter survival need without paying 40% of your income so someone else can own something. \n\nAccording to some people, the whole point isn\u2019t survival needs. It\u2019s profit.",

You claim you rent out the house while you're \"out of town\" keeping in mind you don't actually live there so you're probably out of town most of the time.\n4. You're not rich but you have a mortgage on at least a second house of $2000.  Unless of course you were really banking on exploiting the housing market to make other people pay your mortgage on your party house.\n5. You only use it for parrying, snowboarding, and vacation.\n6. You claim it's your \"home\" but again you don't live there.  No it's just a property you own.  Or the bank will pretty soon if you can't pay the mortgage without renting it lol.\n\nYeah what the fuck ever man.  You're full of shit.  This law is exactly for people like you taking away from the housing supply.",

I am going to assume you use this framework in other areas as well. As an example are you for or against a minimum wage? Loads of libertarians are against it since \"If someone agrees to work for $1.00 an hour its their choice to do so as its a voluntary agreement.\". The issue being that doing any work for $1.00 an hour in the US is 100% exploitative and saying that \"it's voluntary\" ignores the difference in power dynamics between an employer and an employee. Thats where the government steps in and says \"You have to at least pay them X amount as to not exploit them.\". The fact that an agreement between two parties is voluntary is irrelevant as to whether or not it should be allowed to happen both from a business and legal perspective. Voluntarily agreeing to be killed by someone who has always wanted to be murdered won't overturn a conviction for the killer. My point to all of that is that just because something is voluntary doesn't mean it shouldn't have regulation which I think dovetails nicely into what we are actually talking about.\n\nYour example is correct, a house being purchased does drive up prices (as a general statement). Do you recognize there being a difference between 1 person buying a house and 1 person buying 100 houses as to how that would affect the market and society as a whole? That difference (assuming you recognize it) is what the problem is. The amount of pressure 1 person (or 1 corporation thanks to citizens united) should be able to exert over society as a whole SHOULD be limited and the problem with AirBnB is that they are exerting more pressure than is \"fair\". And to answer the last question in your second paragraph the government does have tools to \"artificially\" regulate broader markets through stuff like the lowering and raising of interest rates but thats besides the point we are talking about. \n\nThere is no such thing as natural market pressures and that phrase further convinces me that you lean more into the libertarian camp. Markets aren't natural to begin with and the idea that \"the invisible hand of the market corrects things\" should be looked at as being as ridiculous as Reaganomics. There is no maybe about the harm it causes for pretty much any resource including housing to be controlled by a select few people or companies and thats exactly what has been happening with AirBnB. That is why monopolies are viewed as being so dangerous and even though I'm sure there are examples of individuals who \"lose\" due to all sorts of regulations it is better for society as a whole to have regulations over none. And thats not to say all regulations we had/ have/ or will have are perfect but to leave it all up to \"voluntary agreements\" will result in more problems for more people as wealth and power would continue to be hoarded away by the haves and the have-nots would learn to deal without or would die. Again your idea of what makes a transaction \"moral\" is in my opinion skewed by the idea that markets dictate all when that has never been and hopefully will never be the case. On top of that like I said earlier there are tons and tons of examples of transactions that are kept from happening due to their exploitative nature and the AirBnB situation counts as just that.",

By restricting rent, you shrink the investment in the housing market. This might alleviate some pains in the short term, but does nothing positive in the long term.\n\nYou have two companies wanting to buy 1000 units as a rental investments each. But there are only 1500 units on the market. 500 additional units will get built. But now rent control policies are enacted (rent limits, no more abnb, etc.) Now that those dollars have dried up, it no longer makes sense to build the 500 additional units. Ultimately, more roofs to put over peoples head = lower rent. \n\nShouldn\u2019t we be doing everything we can to promote home building?

Markets are manipulated all the time, including the markets you mentioned. Food/ agriculture as a whole is very heavily subsidized across the world but especially in our country. Housing is also subsidized here as well. Not sure how it works with anesthesiologist specifically but I know with doctors the US restricts the number of doctors that are able to get into the field (partly to ensure high quality, partly because politics in this country is what it is). Yes supply and demand is a very obvious example of one factor that drives prices but it is almost never the only factor, specifically when a \"market\" is ran by people who value profits over people's well being. There are ways supply and demand can be directly manipulated by the government (and other entities) as well like how California does a large tax credit when someone purchases an electric vehicle. Thats an example of the government providing incentives that otherwise wouldn't be there to buy what is normally a comparatively more expensive vehicle that the state determined is better for its future interest. Policy like that feeds into a Political Economy which is much closer to what I tend to advocate for, especially when compared to the idea that the economy is some untouchable force that gets to dictate people's lives because that's just the way it is. Supply and demand in a vacuum is one thing, but in our world there is no vacuum and our economy is so intertwined with economies all over the world that even without bad actors manipulating things all the time you'd be hard pressed to find an example of anything economics wise that didn't also have political aspects to it. Think of how governments across the world use sanctions to pressure countries to do different things. The idea that supply and demand dictates all or is even the main force in today's world is bonkers to me.  \n\nI find that for every example a person can give of a government doing harm through regulation one can be given of a government going above and beyond to improve peoples lives. When you look at the freest, happiest, most successful countries in the world right now you get a list of countries that are heavily regulated through taxation and even regulated through having the government takeover certain aspects of economies (Healthcare being a shining example of a bad industry to leave up to \"market forces\" alone). \n\nTo the extent that I agree with your point that going after abnb and corporate landlords will shrink investment in the housing market, i think its a good thing. Those types of investments by people utilizing abnb and corporate landlords are investments that have been shown time and time again to not be beneficial to the city and certainly not to the people who live there. The argument that it only alleviates short term pain and doesn't provide long term benefits ignores that short term pains for people often result in long term ones. If people are able to more easily obtain a lower priced rent because the pressure abnb exerts on the longterm renter market (by taking those properties off of that market and putting it into a short term renter market that is drastically more expensive) is gone it makes it easier for people to save money which is better for everyone. If the only thing putting restrictions on abnb/ corporate landlords did was alleviate short term pains i would say its worth doing just based off of that but knowing that if abnb was allowed to continue doing what its been doing the \"short term pains\" would continue to get worse and worse as more of the market was swallowed up by them if left unregulated. \n\nYour example of companies wanting 1000 houses being built each is a solid example in a vacuum but in the real world things get complicated. Many companies involved with this short term rental stuff (abnb as far as I know) aren't interested in building at all and even if they were, building in places like NYC isn't feasible for tons and tons of reasons some just coming to certain regulations that may be hindering that from happening but some of it due to the fact that there isn't acres and acres of open land in NYC to build on so even if a company decided they wanted to build places it may not be doable. The idea that more roofs over people's heads equals cheaper rent is only true in that hypothetical vacuum where a company doesn't decide that they need more profits simply because they can make them which we have seen practically every major corporation do since the pandemic. Hell, look at how much of the insane inflation we've seen since Covid is attributed to the rise in corporate profits. Initially there were some supply chain issues that contributed to price increases but estimates suggest as much as 60% of the increase in inflation can be attributed to a rise in corporate profits. Businesses all across the country decided they could make more money than they were making before and they ran with it which has caused problems for everyone except for the people that already were in positions of power. \n\nI agree that we should be doing more to promote building new houses and turning more buildings into livable housing but what you're advocating for to me seems to be exactly the opposite of that. Taking what houses are available for residents to either buy or rent long term off of that market for the sole purpose of short term rentals (which they only do because its more profitable) does exactly the opposite of what you're suggesting be done to lower rents. It worsens an already scarce market which hurts literally everyone other than the people exacerbating the problem. I don't understand how you square that. \n\nThe solution to me as a non expert with this stuff is to provide more incentive for people building housing (which can be done through the government) AND restricting stuff like short term rentals and corporate landlords. I think saying \"sure they're both bad but one is worse\" is making the best the enemy of the good which is pointless. I don't think you can make a place prosperous by taxing just to tax but taxation in this country is rigged in favor of the rich in nearly every conceivable way and if that weren't the case maybe stuff like veterans benefits and social security wouldn't be up for cuts every couple years. The reality is that there is a middle ground between too little regulation and too much regulation that needs to be reached and what government SHOULD be doing is constantly trying to find that middle ground, passing legislation to reach it, and reassessing said legislations effects to make sure that is what its doing. I know that's not what happens in general here but I think the abnb stuff is a good example of the government trying to do just that. \n\nIf this is where the conversation ends its been awesome (for me at least). I forget how much I enjoy this type of stuff. Thanks for the fun back and forth and sorry I'm so bad to get off track.",

If it was \u201cwe have homeless because rent is expensive\u201d, then this problem would be easy to fix.\n\nIf you were rich and had multiple house to rent out for free, would you let a drug addict in knowing they could overdose or start a fire in your property?",

I told him interior decorating paid really well in boston and it\u2019d be $8000 plus cost of a uhaul and parking permit and plus the cost of some college hunks to haul the stuff up there\u2026 after I told him it\u2019d be 12,500 to decorate it he offered to rent it to me for a low monthly rate, he was asking $400 a day and when I told him all that he asked if I\u2019d rent it monthly for $1500. Which was cheap for the, but I\u2019m not going to move my shit into an Airbnb unit and have him change his mind. Then again when the laws changed I could have used mass tenants law and dragged out eviction and bought the place cheap.\n\nI\u2019m not Machiavellian enough! I guess 12,500 to decorate an apartment is a lot for someone without a license (plus the ikea bill). For someone to professionally decorate it with non ikea stuff it\u2019d be way more.\n\nThat was fuck you go away money. Commies driving up the cost of real estate in boston and trying to knock half off the rental for me to decorate the whole place. Like ikea is an hour away.\n\nWould have been karma if I moved in, told the state I was disabled (I am), which means he cannot evict me, he doesn\u2019t know the law and my friends are all lawyers so I could probably have gotten that unit cheap if I knew airbnb was to be outlawed.\n\nIn my old building a unit was for sale? Every buyer was Chinese and they tried to crowd me out as a group from the broker. Like literally strangers banding together against a native to try to turn it into a hotel room. Fuck them I hope they lost a lot of money.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell them about the cloth wires that weren\u2019t safe in the 1960s and the 1914 plumbing that barely worked and the illegal stoves, was going to wait for it to pop on Airbnb and tell the city, don\u2019t box me out of a cheap unit so you can make it a hotel room.",

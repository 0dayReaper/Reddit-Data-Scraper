Once it stopped trading in the window I never bought it again, even though I had a lot of faith in the company because I thought I could do better trading other stocks.\n\nAfter it hit $100 I looked back and saw that my largest holding ever was $25k, or about 10k shares. Literally missed out on a million dollars because I didn\u2019t just buy and hold. Same with plug power, had a similar amount in 2012 and for ~1, it went to $60. I get sad when I look at my day trading attempts because if I would have just held everything from that time period I could be significantly more wealthy.",

I still remember when people on this sub(INTC bulls) made fun of people for buying AMD and it basically had the same rep as meme stocks in 2017-2018.",

                            "comment": "Yep. So Intel had the lead with the Pentium and Pentium 2. When the Pentium 3 came around, we were getting into the race to 1 gigahertz. That\u2019s when AMD had their Athlon processors. And they were REALLY good. Not only did AMD beat Intel on performance, they were the first to hit 1Ghz too. \n\nAfter the Pentium 3 came Netburst, aka the Pentium 4. AMD had the Bulldozer. And Bulldozer was absolutely terrible. To be fair, the Pentium 4 was also terrible. The Netburst architecture had a ridiculously long pipeline and really bad branch prediction. Which meant that the really long pipeline often had to be completely flushed. Netburst was supposed to bring us to 6-10Ghz and beyond but ended up running ridiculously hot. And the poor branch prediction led to bad performance. Intel won this era purely because Bulldozer was pretty bad. \n\nAnd then came Nehalem. The chosen one. The golden goose. You know the Nehalem architecture as the core 2 architecture. This is when Intel truly went multicore. \n\nNehalem was a fucking beast. It was truly a leap forward in computer processors. At the High Frequency Trading shop I worked at we got a ton of these boxes in before anyone else. We mopped up the market with these boxes. These boxes made us millions of dollars per day, every single day. Nehalem blew everything out of the water. At the time, they were FAST. \n\nIntel continued to milk the \u201ccore\u201d processors for years. By the time Sandy Bridge came around, Intel\u2019s processors were incredibly stagnant. Each new tick/tock only brought maybe 3-5% real world gains. Intel never really increased core count. Desktops were stuck on 2, maaaaybe 4 cores. And servers were stuck on 4/8 cores per processor. \n\nI remember having meetings with Intel around this time and telling them I wasn\u2019t really impressed with their latest architecture. By this point, there were whispers of a new CPU design at AMD. This was when AMD stock was at its lowest point. \u201cZen\u201d was supposed to save AMD. Supposedly this new processor would beat Intel. But that is what they said about Bulldozer. So it was hard to trust any of the rumors. \n\nAnd then they released Ryzen. They have the HEDT processors 16 cores. SIXTEEN. Even the cheaper Ryzen chips came with 8 cores. Twice the HEDT offering from Intel. And four times the cores HEDT vs HEDT. \n\nBut Bulldozer had way more cores than Intel, and it still sucked. Core for core, how did Ryzen do? Pretty well, actually. The first release if I remember correctly came damn close to beating Intel. By the 3000 series, AMD was dominant in almost everything. Intel had one last hold out. AVX 512. But by the 7000 series Ryzen, even that had been matched if not outdone. Intel is now fully dethroned in every category. \n\nDr. Lisa Su toppled the (in my opinion) biggest, most cutting edge company in the world. All while AMD still having the sting of their former FAB dragging them down. \n\nIntel\u2019s Nehalem and beyond chips were world class. Truly some of the best processors I\u2019ve ever seen. And Dr. Su topped that and then some, for half the price, and double the cores.",

    "postText": "**The Fed**\n\nCPI Y/Y: 4.0% vs. 4.1% expected CPI M/M: 0.1% vs. 0.1% expected CORE CPI Y/Y: 5.3% vs. 5.2% expected CORE CPI M/M: 0.4% vs. 0.4% expected\n\nThe contribution of Core Services, excluding shelter, is falling and is now at 14.6% YoY. This could be a reason for the Fed to signal a pause or adjustment in their policy decisions. The shelter index was the primary driver of the monthly increase in the index for all items excluding food and energy, but it has declined for the second consecutive month on a YoY basis. However, it's important to note that the Fed's model uses a moving average approach, so it is expected to continue decreasing in the following month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l5btm48lu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ac32f6e1005b6345f66f429ed5d56fbe687e1ff2\n\nAmong the other indexes that increased in May, the index for used cars and trucks rose by 4.4 percent. However, as mentioned last week, the wholesale used car index has been decreasing in May. Therefore, it is possible that the index for used cars and trucks may come down next month as a result.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9oopgp6alu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21532712a148795bb268018530cc61e6c192190b\n\nInterestingly yoy CPI core goods (represented by the blue line) increased to +2%, first time in 11 month. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s35zyiwelu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1001c8a62116c16e31c6be2d0433aa2f1d855271\n\nMeanwhile, US wages outpaced inflation on a year-over-year basis by 0.2%, marking the end of a streak of 25 consecutive months of negative real wage growth. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5uhlqlwrlu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f781e214e9b2c586d721576d00a3ae1109a73123\n\nA pause is completely priced in and the most likely scenario tomorrow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ei9rmzbxlu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f2d132f424c59d9038b7852b915c0c5ba4afad4f\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) has taken measures to address liquidity concerns by cutting the overnight, 7-day, and 1-month standing lending facility rates by 10 basis points (bps). This action is in line with the discussions we had last week regarding the liquidity situation in China. \n\n**The Economy**\n\nThe May update to the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations has revealed tighter credit conditions. According to the survey, the share of respondents indicating that it is \"much harder\" to obtain credit compared to a year ago (represented by the blue line) has risen to its highest level in a decade. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sk6og6m4mu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ed98b87854e8845b86f221f19faa20773b235aea\n\nAccording to the indexes tracked by Citi, economic surprises vary across different regions. The U.S. (represented by the blue line) and Asia Pacific (represented by the white line) have shown relatively better performance in terms of economic surprises compared to the Eurozone (represented by the orange line). And remember both EU and Japanese markets had made new high this year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rctws1fmu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=98aeab96663c332376452120f811b1e1bc2815f3\n\nThe NFIB Small Business Optimism index has experienced a slight increase which is an improvement than data last month. But similar to last month, that the \"hard\" components of the index, which typically refer to concrete and measurable factors, are performing better than the \"soft\" components, which may be more subjective in nature. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sk1eejdnmu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2bd0060714f7eb985f5dec27be5e43395b59b66e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gpk8t2omu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aa75a575a5a456647d1906b3fc4869fbd4a5c3d5\n\nAnother thing worth noting from the NFIB report is that even though average selling prices is still declining, there has been an increase in plans to raise selling prices among small businesses, reaching the highest level since January. Additionally, the percentage of firms citing inflation as their single-most important problem has reached a three-month high.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdwsmmh0nu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bcc06b1553cac6b05bb1f6d9be4a48c788b641a2\n\n**The Business**\n\nproofread: I shared this chart last week. Back then the number was only 23% -- a 2 year low, and one week later\u2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4jcci15nu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=27ded9e8371dbc535684684bc70cf432804788ff\n\nIndividual investors, as indicated by the AAII poll, haven't displayed this level of optimism since November 2021. Bulls currently outnumber Bears by over 20%. Similarly, active managers, as per the NAAIM survey, are also exhibiting high levels of optimism, with net exposures increasing to 90% from 12% in late September.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cwkarlx7nu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f527302a1c1e6a15294baa5ceff44ceb065fb343\n\nInflows continue to be entirely in large caps\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iro3dqe9nu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ca12ede6581fe74a766df586f5595f047439aa17\n\nBoA fund manager survey results for June is released. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nAllocators have reduced their cash levels to 5.1%, reaching a 19-month low. The most crowded trades among investors are \"long big tech\" and \"short China.\" Additionally, a net 87% of investors participating in the survey expect lower global consumer price index (CPI) in the next 12 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtv3htgjnu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a02c77599db1843fc59ec1ad09cee358c5568588\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8eevpigrnu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5d5b4892e98d86a6852d24945679f3eca7e89c8c\n\nMajority of FMs still think large cap will out perform small cap but the number is lower than last month. Meanwhile, more FMs OW tech vs energy than last month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/385rrebpnu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a49b61adcc706c05e6bd08850ce2491716b1919a\n\nComparing to last month, credit crunch worries are down, central bank worries are back up\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahp7wwvwnu5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fdebdb8b0a0fdef193cd341dff3d6864d0eac2da\n\nFMs are still OW bonds and UW equities. Either they are lying or they are lying. FM surveys are pretty much just a joke at this point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9uoeq12ou5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=058749476d819b3493495875ced553c22618f923\n\nBears are in retreat, pain trade continues\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz1suo36ou5b1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f05027bef8daacb28a40dabc5325df0cc8d4e511",

You get 4K gaming at 120 Hz on a device that can run multiple programs simultaneously, stuffed with sensors for which you had to haul another ton of stuff, provides professional grade camera quality and communication/data transfer protocols that surpass everything in 2010 by a lightyear. What a dumb way to play down technological progress because you just have to justify simping for a company that makes marginal improvements and still makes you pay an arm and a leg for the same phone, year after year.\n\n&gt; yet it doesn\u2019t feel like it?\n\nit's called being spoiled. After you do cocaine, gobbling a ton of chocolate won't, \"feel like it\" either.\n\nWindows is shit because Microsoft never went the, \"walled garden\" approach that Apple simps keep screeching about. Windows has to make allowance for *every* third party support, that's what got them to corner the PC market in the 90s in the first place. But over the last 3 decades, along with hardware, software development has exploded and that makes Microsoft model of 90s bloated and useless. I wouldn't touch another Microsoft product with my grandfather's dead hand that has been rotting since the 2000s either. But Apple is worse and it has a much uglier business model than Microsoft, to survive in this era.\n\nAnd we don't even talk about the un-recyclable garbage we have been producing at an exponential rate since the smart devices became a global phenomenon.",

A full time 40 hour work week would be $290 paychecks (before taxes).  Good luck paying for rent and food on that, let alone anything else.\n\nThats all assuming the employer is willing to let the worker be full-time. If possible, many employers prefer to have 2 employees work 20 hours as part time as opposed to offering a single full time position. This is because they aren\u2019t required to offer benefits like profit sharing options or health care coverage or vacation time if the employee is only part time.",

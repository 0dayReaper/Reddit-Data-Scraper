Been bumpy wvee since, but it seems we're finally flattening out.\n\nWhile there's likely some dilution ahead, it's not necessarily a killer argument againsthe stock. At least not for me.\n\nThe recent hike of NKLA was a refreshing change.\n\nObviously, 90% of you regards hate the company which is why I'm asking those of you who dare to inverse WSB and join me on this self destructive journey.\n\nLet's burn \ud83d\udd25 some money?\n\nAnybody?",

Even selling a battery truck faster and before others like Tesla.\n\nSo what if people just can't let go of that sentiment?",

I get that they had their controversies in the past but those are gone. Right now they are a (struggling) startup but one that made progress. They sold a battery truck. Even faster than Tesla and this year the FCEV truck will be available. This time it will even be able to roll up a hill and I really really hope they have the balls to make a commercial on that one \ud83e\udd23",

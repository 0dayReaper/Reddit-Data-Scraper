Talk about bullish!!\n\n* Only 10% will be awarded if MVIS is in the $12 range for 20 days.\n* 30% will be awarded to them if MVIS is in the $18 range for 20 days.\n* 30% will be awarded when MVIS hits $24 for 20 days\n* The last 30% will be awarded when MVIs hits $36 for 20 days.\n\nMVIS board of directors have until the end of 2025 to hit these goals. Other notes:\n\n* Still have an At-The-Money offering available.\n* Shareholders recently approved an additional 100 millions shares to be authorized.\n\n* Also, Sumit (CEO) recently got divorced. Following his divorce, he dropped major cash and bought 100k shares (a few weeks ago).\n* Shorts have a high cost to borrow fees, and FTDs are getting spicy. Hardly any shares to borrow!\n\nHop on the MVIS rocket for a once in a lifetime opportunity!  \n\n\nMy position: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hy0pd5maxk4b1.png?width=1060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=08bad2e56f1cd712e97d7f53fb11ada830189eef",

If I remember correctly summer of 2023 has been talked about for awhile as when decisions will be made for 2025 model year cars. \n\nThe whole lidar sector has been shorted heavily over the last year and the theory a lot of people including myself have is that shorts are exiting their positions now as we are getting closer to when deals will start being announced. \n\nFollowers of MVIS realized that it was way oversold especially when it dropped below $2 and gobbled up a bunch of shares. Lidar is going to be big, and if like myself you believe that MVIS is going to be one of the players then the price action makes sense.\n\nI've got 20k shares at about $5 average that I've bought at various price points over the last 3 years. I will say that I'm not buying more at the moment, but that has a lot to do with the fact that it was $2 a couple of months ago and now it just doesn't feel as impactful.",

This is important because MVIS has been burning tons of cash trying to set themselves up as a top contender in the Lidar game, and they won't start making any money to offset that until deals get signed.",

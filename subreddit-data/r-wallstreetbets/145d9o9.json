    "postText": "RIVN is presenting at DB Auto Conference on 6/15/23. \n\nRecent news last night was GM and TSLA with charging stations, thats why TSLA gaped up huge overnight.\n\nPast few days have been seeing large amounts of volume on RIVN 7/21 17.5c. The OI is currently at 85,687 now. With a whopping volume of over 46,000 right now! Will see on Monday morning how much translates over to OI.   \nFor you TA crayon eaters, RIVN has been stuck is a range at lows here, and chopping around, could be basing and forming a bottom? Many other companies that were seeing pure bearish momentum have finally started to see some change in trends to the bull side. Is RIVN next? Well the options movement certainly may point to it? \n\nI am guessing it may be some news catalyst at the conference with charging stations if so.",

    "postText": "NOTE- friendly reminder I will not be around tomorrow trading, no pre-market and I wont be around intraday\u2026 I will however, have my normal weekly TA up!\n\nWell I got to say that was one terrible day of trading for me\u2026 Thursday and Fridays continue to be my demise\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x56zhpj17v4b1.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=39cfe0b455c8984a5aafadcdb16b5f9c221ebd15\n\nWell with SPY closure today SPY officially is in a bull market again\u2026 now this is where definitions of returning to a bull market varies\u2026 some assume it is just when a total 20% recovery from the low of the bear market happens. If that is your definition then back in February bulls did that\u2026 however, if your definition is from the lowest closing price of the bear market a 20% recovery of that\u2026 then today is your day\u2026 honestly, from here no matter how you look at it\u2026 there is no denying that we officially are back in a bull market\u2026 \n\nThis is where the market is one big psychological mind game\u2026 so 3 weeks ago I said what? I said we likely touch $430\u2026 we have failed to touch it but have come within about 40 cents of it 3x now\u2026 Now there is a lot of things saying that we are nearing the top and that we need a pullback\u2026\n\nHowever, what is the one thing that cant be predicted? Well that would be FOMO\u2026 Today actually was an incredible example of this.. IF you follow me aggressively track and watch VOLD\u2026 VOLD is the up/down volume of the NYSE\u2026 Eli5 is that basically it shows if there is more buyers or more sellers are one time\u2026 now I would say 95-99% of the time its spot on and market rarely doesn\u2019t go where VOLD goes where up or down. \n\nHowever, today until about 1215 VOLD was in a serious decline all day\u2026 however, price went up on SPY the whole time. Why? Well in my opinion its because what can happen at times is that there is fewer large buys but more frequent smaller sells\u2026 so the net would be that there is more buying actually happening but its disguised as sells\u2026 \n\nThe thing that I thing will be unpredictable is the FOMO now that we officially have entered a bull market\u2026 I mean if you think about it if you haven\u2019t bought in yet because you were afraid the bear market rally was going to come to an end\u2026 hearing that this is finally an official bull market would be a pretty good reason to buy\u2026. \n\nAverage bull markets have historically lasted a lot longer than bear market (below stats are of every bear/ bull market)\u2026\n\nAverage bull: 1,011 days\u2026. Median bull: 522 days\n\nAverage bear: 286 days\u2026. Median bear: 240 days\n\nTake a look at the last 4 bear/ bull markets\u2026\n\nThe last 4 bear markets averaged 196 days and a total decline of 34.7%... the bull markets that followed those bear markets were an average of 1232 days and 139.8%...  \n\nThat would mean that we nearly perfectly hit the average length of a bear market (average decline is 35.1% though)\u2026 Which means if we are 233 days and 20% into the current bull market\u2026 we COULD have 94-119.8% and about 289 days to go in this \u201crally\u201d before we would see a correction\u2026\n\nNow yes trust me I am very clear on inflation, rate hikes, pause/ rate cuts, etc. etc. but if you are a long term investor why would you not want to buy at the official start of the bull market? \n\nTomorrow could be a very interesting day\u2026\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/832qqm727v4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bb5e0372fb999b9fd8bf410db196dbda6a1c1217\n\nI am impressed to say the least but the bulls strength\u2026 but after putting a supply in at 428.06 yesterday, the bulls have officially came in and put in a new demand at 426.57\u2026 In doing so we have now closed over that 428.06 supply and that least 428.68 as our target for tomorrow\u2026 IF we gap up over it or punch through it tomorrow I have no resistance until 437.87 on the daily and I have nothing on the weekly until 453.23\u2026 I should also mentioned the daily DMI has officially completely its wave down\u2026 \n\nFrom a weekly supply and demand stand point\u2026 bears need a closure under 427.35 and bulls need a closure anywhere over 428.4.\n\nAlmost every time SPY has put a new demand (support) in the next day has been a very green day\u2026 lets take a look at the date of a new demand and what % SPY moved up the next day. \n\n4/26= 1.99%  \n 5/4= 1.85%  \n 5/12= 0.35%  \n 5/16= 1.21%  \n 5/25= 1.3%  \n \n\nOn average SPY have closed +1.34% the day after it puts in a new demand (support).\n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7t1lrp27v4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d108765ade11297c4133454a7671c38785acaa98\n\nLast night this looked like a nice inverse head and shoulders which could lead to downside\u2026 however, I got bear trapped and that definitely was not the move\u2026 this actually is turning around to be now a double bottom and bullish engulfing daily candle\u2026 this actually with a breakout tomorrow could (and even with a breakdown as long as we held 426.6) a massive bull flag that would almost certainly lead us to a green day tomorrow. \n\nReally the last thing that\u2019s standing in SPYs way from a closure in the 430s is this 429.6 resistance. \n\nThe black bull channel resistance will be 435.51 tomorrow and red bull channel resistance is 431.2.\n\nRealistically I think we could see SPY close 432-435 tomorrow. \n\nSPY DAILY LEVELS  \n Supply- 422.04 -&gt; 428.06 -&gt; 429.68  \n Demand- 426.57 -&gt; 437.87  \n Support- 426.6 -&gt; 424.5  \n Resistance- 429.7 -&gt; 431.6 -&gt; 435.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li4ve3b37v4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a7dfc7cdd70161b9ea470494a7113ad8b7f4429\n\nFor the last 4 days 4292 has been a strong resistance and it was even confirmed as supply (strong resistance) yesterday\u2026 however, today the bulls immediately turned around and closed a new demand (support) at 4273. In doing so we also bounced off the daily 8ema (which in extreme bull momentum means we should see upside from here).\n\nWe now have our last resistance at 4312 and from there we have nothing on the daily or weekly until 4395/ 4540\u2026.\n\nFrom a weekly stand point bulls ideally want a closure over 4290 and bears need a closure under 4284. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b82ceur37v4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=50b6ca2d66d3696576673acf34c10ff040c5da95\n\nThis daily price action is incredible as we went from a double top -&gt; double bottom -&gt; double top with bearish engulfing -&gt; double bottom bullish engulfing\u2026 I actually don\u2019t know if I have ever seen that make double tops/ bottoms in a row before\u2026 \n\nFutures to close over 4300 right now for the first time since August 16th\u2026 \n\nThis to me looks like a very clear daily 8ema support test and now bounce\u2026 \n\nFUTURES DAILY LEVELS  \n Supply- 4240 -&gt; 4292 -&gt; 4312  \n Demand- 4273 -&gt; 4395  \n Support- 4273 -&gt; 4232  \n Resistance- 4300 -&gt; 4312 -&gt; 4351\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/87hf8c747v4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9b3a0b86f136016c7db63aefcc84c2749e15bc08\n\nNow QQQ I have been saying for the last week or so that I thought it was the best short\u2026 it now looks like the strongest upside move here\u2026 QQQ just came down and while not a perfect double bottom did bounce off 347.93 demand area. IT also after losing its daily 8ema while in extreme bull momentum on daily and weekly retook its 8ema\u2026 QQQ to me looks like it is minimally going to touch 357 if not 361.7 tomorrow.. \n\nNow the one thing here that is possibly keeping QQQ at check is that it did not put in a new demand today\u2026 however, tomorrow almost certainly will be a new demand in with a green day\u2026 \n\nLets take a look at the last couple times QQQ put a new demand in and how much it bounced\u2026\n\n4/26= 2.72%  \n 5/4= 2.13%  \n 5/12= 0.54%  \n 5/16= 1.21%  \n 5/19= 0.34%  \n 5/24= 2.43%  \n 5/31= 1.16%\n\nThat means on average QQQ pumps 1.5% the day after putting a new demand in\u2026 \n\nNow yes I know we did not put one in\u2026 but we will put one in tomorrow at this rate\u2026 the daily DMI also has fully cycled to oversold and is ready for a bullish signal up\u2026\n\nLooking at the past of QQQ today the last 2 days remind me a lot of 4/25 and 4/26, also from a non candle structure but indicator stand point of 5/24.   \n   \n \n\nQQQ DAILY LEVELS  \n Supply- 354.95 -&gt; 357.09 -&gt; 369.32  \n Demand- 347.93 -&gt; 361.7  \n   \n \n\n**TSLA UPDATE**\n\nWell you guys know I swung some TSLA 220P over night\u2026 they opened green\u2026 quickly went red and quickly came back green\u2026 I attempted my best to get a fill at 20% green and it wouldn\u2019t fill for me\u2026 it very quickly went red against me and well from there it never saw green again\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esxe5zz47v4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2bef4e8c274e6a155da25d9f5fd232124b271273\n\nWell today TSLA officially closed its 10th green day in a row\u2026 and as of right now after hours TSLA is up 3.36% and will most likely close its 11th green day in a row tomorrow\u2026 \n\nIf you missed the news\u2026 TSLA and GM now teaming up also\u2026\n\n**VIX**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sysk42j57v4b1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9eb27143c48f19bf6637642887740822e3fa37a3\n\nWe were all wondering why the VIX was dropping so low to pre-covid levels\u2026 well today we see just why\u2026 we are not in bull market territory and the VIX has now found itself back to bull market levels\u2026 \n\nFor the last basically 5 days the VIX has tried to bounce and has tried to put in a new demand (Support)\u2026 however, it continues to find itself selling off constantly\u2026 \n\nWe just much like May 31st tested and rejected the white bear channel resistance that we have been in since May 24th\u2026. The VIX now remains in extreme bear momentum on a weekly and daily time frame\u2026 \n\nThis means that not only are SPY and VIX moving together but we are in opposing extreme momentums which could make this market do some pretty wild things\u2026. \n\nThe yellow support line is from 4/19 and 5/1\u2026 that support sits at 13.28 tomorrow and the next support is the red one from 12/2 and 2/2 which that support sits at 13.11 tomorrow\u2026 \n\nFun facts here about the last few Fridays\u2026\n\nJune 2nd= VIX -6.59%, SPY 1.45%, QQQ 0.75%  \n May 26th= VIX -6.22%, SPY 1.3%, QQQ 2.56%  \n May 19th= VIX 4.8%, SPY -0.15%, QQQ -0.23%  \n May 12th= VIX 0.71%, SPY -0.13%, QQQ -0.36%  \n May 5th= VIX -14.44%, SPY 1.85%, QQQ 2.13%  \n April 28th= VIX -7.34%, SPY 0.85%, QQQ 0.69%  \n April 21st= VIX -2.33%, SPY 0.08%, QQQ 0.1%  \n April 14th= VIX -4.15%, SPY -0.24%, QQQ -0.19%   \n April 6th (Thursday\u2026 no Friday= VIX -3.67%, SPY 0.39%, QQQ 0.67%   \n March 31st= VIX -1.68%, SPY 1.41%, QQQ 1.66%   \n March 24th= VIX -3.93%, SPY 0.66%, QQQ 0.37%\n\nOf the last 11 Fridays\u2026 \n\nThe VIX has closed red 9 out of 11 times for an average move of -4.08%.  \n SPY has closed green 8 out of 11 times for an average move of 0.68%+.  \n QQQ has closed green 8 out of 11 times for an average move of 0.74%+.\n\nNow if we include this with the fact that SPY made a new demand and that usually means a +1.34% day and QQQ should turn today into a demand which usually means +1.5% day\u2026 the odds of a green day tomorrow are high especially after 4 days of consolidation on SPY and officially entering a bear market.\n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ufb772267v4b1.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6b2a4c25dae48793ba8323442e680e6b6a6abc8d\n\nI got smoked today\u2026 had two nice wins in the morning there and from there it was just terrible\u2026 as I had mentioned VOLD was pretty much inversing the trend all day long which is extremely abnormal and not usually how markets behave\u2026 with that I honestly should have just not even traded\u2026 I even tried to play the upside in the morning bull run and perfectly managed to find the one red pullback candle\u2026 I was watching for that bigger retrace we had all day and well I was so opposed to taking it due to struggling I wasn\u2019t even able to capitalize on it.. I ended up playing a call for the end of day run up and closed it profitable\u2026 definitely closed it early before it saw 5-6x profits of where I closed but at that point I was just happy to close out on a win\u2026 \n\nTough day of trading\u2026 \n\nI still have the tesla swing and will include that on my log tomorrow for those of you wondering about where that is at\u2026 \n\nAs of right now even with todays terrible day and the full loss on the small lotto tesla put I will close out a green week of trading but definitely one of my worst trading weeks in over 2 months\u2026 \n\nAs I said I wont be trading tomorrow and honestly after today im kinda happy to have the day off and being able to mentally reset before next week.

Textbook reversal candle on the daily. \n\nNext week we have potential catalysts that could break us out of this range. But for now, it\u2019s consolidation mode between 426 and 429.",

If we were in a bull market People would be front running calls buying 4600-4700 calls for October etc but that is not happening. In fact market participants are short the highest since 2007. This is not normal. \n\nThe options contracts that vix tracks 23-37 dte puts have fallen in volume by 60% since October when 0dte came around. This is why vix is fucked. This tells us 2 things. \n\n1. People are not hedging downside\n\n2. Tail risk is extremely high\n\nFront loading delta into 0dte calls to prop the market up is not spelling bull market to me. They are just running the indices while it's profitable. Yesterday they sold fuck tonnes of 4270 puts while we were at 4261 this absolutely crushed vix then they bought calls at 4280 and 4290 with the credit. Mm hedged all the way into the calls.",

    "postText": "People are ignoring 5% inflation is remaining extremely sticky and the money supply is tightening while screaming about a bull market. PLTR is one day probably going to be a 1T company. It's the only company doing what it does, and it is already building a massive moat and will one day be worth a lot. But not today and not a month from now.\n\nTo put it a different way, PLTR right now is a Charmander. One day it will be a Charizard. Do not pay the price of a Charizard for a Charmander. \n\n\nPositions: I trimmed 20 PLTR $17 2025 leaps down to 1. I also bought SQQQ to hedge down. I'm mostly in cash. Who knows, I might be wrong about all this but I say PLTR is way too high right now and tech is about to get sold off again.\n\nResearch: Yahoo Finance said we were entering a bull market yesterday and APPL released those fucking stupid iGoggles, which are both bearish indicators.",

If the old system is generating problems, tweaking it and just doing more fake stuff is the solution. It's always been the solution. It will always be the solution... and it's a good thing because the natural methodology of economy is that we're hunter/gatherer tribes who die to minor staph infections.

The Fed balance sheet for all of its existence was $0 which was considered \u201cnormal.\u201d It is now at $8,500,000,000,000 (yes, the zeros are correct).  \n\nEverything shifted when it became obvious they would never \u201cnormalize\u201d the balance sheet or ever bring it back down to $0 (this happened around 2016 and then was confirmed in 2018 when they tried to reduce it and markets crashed so they stopped).  \n\nSince then Ben Bernake (head of the Fed who invented QE in 2009) wrote a book explicitly saying the balance sheet will grow infinitely and he won a Nobel Prize in 2022 for it. \n\nUnless they actually do QT - meaning sell off and normalize the balance sheet - the markets are being artificially propped up and projected upwards by the Fed.  \n\nThe Treasury budget has also not returned to prepandemic level and it looks like they are going to get away with never normalizing that either.  \n\nThey are printing and spending infinitely so assets and equities go brrrrrrrr.  \n\nSeriously everything is different. Plots of movies like the Big Short and Margin Call are ABSOLUTELY OBSOLETE post quantitative easing.",

    "postText": "This is not financial advice, and I do not recommend this, but in February of this year I pulled out my Roth IRA from my time in the military. After early withdrawal penalties, I had about $22,000, $4,000 went towards my out-of-pocket maximum for insurance for my daughter\u2019s surgery, and the remaining $18,000 went into a newly opened Webull account. The last time I had traded was March of 2020, I had just learned of this subreddit, learned about options, and turned $1,000 into $3,000 over the course of a couple weeks. I then spent it all on gun stuff, like a true patriot (don\u2019t ask me if I regret my purchases).\n\nGoing into this new round of trading the plan was simple: double my $18,000 or lose it all. Once doubled, withdraw my initial investment to savings and keep trading with the remaining $18,000. When my trading account reached $20,000+, withdraw to savings and leave $10,000.\n\nI\u2019m using a cash account (don\u2019t trust myself with a margin account), trading strictly QQQ 0dte calls and/or puts depending on various factors. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything on the comments, I\u2019m more than happy to share what I\u2019ve learned so far.",

My highest loss in a day was ~16k, and with my system of withdrawing gains when my account reaches $20,000+, down to $10,000 even, the most I could hypothetically lose in one day is $19,999. That only happens if I\u2019m stupid enough to not set stop losses, and even then, if my account goes to $0, so be it. I\u2019ve already pocketed my initial investment twice over, so I have very little fear of losing everything in my trading account. That isn\u2019t to say I\u2019m not careful though.",

But if I am none of those things, then the first thing I care about is money. \n\nNow, the original idea was that other people are paying customers. So, in theory, it would be good that they were inclusive companies because as long as you have money, who the fuck cares.\n\nHowever, the landscape has changed. Now, the ones boycotting Budlight are saying \"no more woke\", whatever the fuck that means. But, they are adults and are choosing to vote with their wallet, counter to what an all inclusive brand would have meant. So now, there is a conundrum companies face. Essentially, \"do we risk neglecting our core market, and thus lose the most money? Or do we try to expand the brand?\"\n\nAs a poor wage slave, however, none of that matters. Just pay me my dues and I'll fuck right off when that clock hits closing time.",

Cases like where there's a vesting schedule, or where I have ownership or significant voting potential, I've kept the stock. But overall, I'd rather diversify my income sources if possible.

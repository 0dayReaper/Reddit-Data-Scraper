    "postText": "*Disclaimer: this is my own stupid thinking, not investment advice. Ask your wife\u2019s boyfriend if this is right for you.*\n\n# Summary\n\nFeel like you missed out on winners, or were too scared to put in your Doordash check? **$SOFI** is literally the next big thing. Bears/bulls, value/growth, regards/chads- it fits every DD. I\u2019m so sure I maxed out my entire life savings. Considering a line of credit on my mom\u2019s house and a margin loan next.\n\n&gt;PROOF w/ my brokerage, 401k, Roth, and Robinhood options\n\n[Brokerage and 401k \\(in the process of converting the other stocks\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xhpywjyxp15b1.png?width=1357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7832a86e0bd6cd1db63cdceb12518f71b714656a)\n\n[Roth](https://preview.redd.it/adkn5fvyp15b1.jpg?width=1148&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d95ea593340b8d97d4f269ff1e33b63badb032dc)\n\n[Robinhood options](https://preview.redd.it/rvbw4tazp15b1.jpg?width=1070&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a33aeffceabd4f3732db5c47215cc7f07b2eebe7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is NOT some SPAC bagholder trying to boost the stock price, nor is it a 0DTE cokehead move. This is a rational thesis for (I believe) a smart equity play. Did I see it go up a few cents, cream my pants, and think I\u2019m the next Buffett writing this post? Maybe. In my opinion this is a 100% small penis 4-bagger and I\u2019m sharing it like Moses with acid tabs.\n\nHere\u2019s the 4-point DD for you with ADHD:\n\n* It\u2019s Robinhood, but actually good for you\n* The company is in great shape\n* Permabears and bulls have reasons to love it\n* The brand is (let me explain) the next JPMorgan Chase\n\n# Thesis\n\n**Product**\n\n* SoFi is actually a great product. Is it the BEST? Fuck no. But it\u2019s like the goldilocks/Anna Kendrick of all apps. The Friday night reliable.\n* The company is going for this generation\u2019s next big bank. It is high-interest, chartered (4.3% APY) and offers everything you need under the sun.\n* The whole company\u2019s theme is: \u201cGet your money right.\u201d They want to be the one-stop shop for all your MONEY needs and they do it with a bank teller smile.\n* SoFi will ride or DIE with you. Student loan refi, your job\u2019s direct deposit, a loan for that cock ring, a credit card for that solo trip to Thailand, a HELOC for that YOLO stock play. It goes on and on.\n* They have consumers in mind, and not in a fake old lady See\u2019s Candy kind of way. For example: if you lose your job and can\u2019t pay your student debt, they will pause your payments and help you find a job. No joke. Look beyond the news and you\u2019ll see people are over the moon about their relationship with SoFi.\n* They have a few bad spots (dogshit trading platform and ETFs that never move), but they are trying so fucking hard. I could go on and on, but it\u2019s 5:49am (couldn\u2019t sleep, came up with this post in a fever dream) and I have a ton more to write.\n* They also have Galileo and Technisys, which are like new PVC pipes for the financial system. I\u2019m literally too smoothbrained to explain this, all you need to know is there is a lot of real interest from banks and companies to use these products. /r/sofistock has nerds who can explain this to you.\n\n**Financials**\n\n* Okay here comes the boring stuff, so skip this if you don\u2019t care about amateur due diligence.\n* Remember when banks used to pay good interest, then you realized they were pocketing it all? People are realizing and going to SoFi. When the bank crisis happened and everyone was moving their money out, SoFi actually GAINED deposits. The company has said they are on-track to add $2B each quarter, and management are known to low-ball their estimates. NINETY PERCENT of their customers use direct deposit for their premium membership SoFi Plus, which will only accelerate the trend. You know how hard it is to change banks with direct deposit. Sticky as shit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jht14744q15b1.jpg?width=782&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fa503be4e6971d54e63f398b39d86b19f381aed5\nh/t /u/SnipahShot for the graphic\n\n* SoFi has EIGHT fucking quarters of consecutive revenue growth, is EBITDA profitable (whatever that\u2019s worth to you), and is projected to be GAAP profitable by Q4. I think there\u2019s an outside chance this happens in Q3. Dig into it more if you want to Burry it [https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc\\_financials/2023/q1/Q1-23-Investor-Presentation\\_.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Q1-23-Investor-Presentation_.pdf)\n* SoFi is growing WHILE student loans have been paused. Name a better miracle. They replaced it by diversifying their business in financial services (e.g. the shit I mentioned earlier) and other loans.\n* While most banks have been selling their loan books at a loss to manage higher interest rates, SoFi have been keeping theirs to maturity and getting a higher return. There is a lot of debate into this, especially around how they calculate mark to market, so again do your own DD about this.\n* By the way: \u201cthere are many reasons insiders sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.\u201d The CEO Anthony Noto is eating pork and beans like me buying the stock like CRAZY. I mean just look at this degeneracy. He knows he has a chance to become the next billionaire bank CEO Jamie Dimon and has purchased back $13.6m dollars worth of shares (1/5 of his total comp so far lmfao).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33ihxpf5q15b1.jpg?width=657&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3786cf8c33f92318fd69d6a4ef63d2e95b3cfc61\n\n**Macro**\n\n* Big picture time. Full disclosure, I\u2019m a permabear. I literally have the worst outlook on things and I metaphorically killed my therapist with my doom and gloom. This country is so levered up to the tits it\u2019s just one gentle breeze away from collapsing.\n* But you know who always gets paid? By hook and crook, the banks will get what they\u2019re owed. If not we are all fucked and/or there will be a bailout. If everything is going to shit, banks are the least dogshit shit. Would you rather buy a stock with a tremendous amount of debt super dependent on consumer spending, or something that will make money in a depression?\n* I said this was a stock for everyone. For the permabulls, everything is fine and SoFi is growing its metrics like a rocket ship. What is there to lose? The management team has signaled good outlooks and the stock price has gone up consecutively since June 1st.\n* For value investors, this stock is still near book value. Most bank stocks are, but considering its fair value by Morningstar ($16) or PT by well-known analysts ($8-12) there are still some mArGiN oF sAfEtY\n* Growthies, this is a tech stock BABY. They are the AWS of finance! They use tech to analyze loan risk. They have AIAIAIAI in a chat bot! Upside everywhere\n* Oh and by the way, $SOFI is not correlated with its peers. Look at $LC $UPST and other fintech companies in the sector. In my mind it\u2019s becoming the Nubank of America.\n* The Fed is expected to \u201cskip\u201d rate hikes next week. Long term that means APY is probably plateauing and on a downward trajectory. But if you know SoFi has done nothing but good and given you the best interest rate, why move?\n\n**Brand**\n\n* Okay let\u2019s start with them suing the government for pausing student loans. The CEO has addressed this multiple times: they support student loan FORGIVENESS, but when it comes to PAUSING payments for borrowers who don\u2019t qualify, they thought the 3rd year was excessive. Yes they shit the bed bad for that, but they\u2019ll recover.\n* Aside from the revenue, a big reason they did this is because the CEO has integrity. Like too much integrity to let this go for shareholders. Anthony Noto grew up working class, graduated from West Point, and rose through the ranks in the finance world. Imagine if Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was real and became a banking god.\n* His track record is insane. CFO for the NFL during record growth. COO for Twitter where he was putting out garbage fires. He knows how to run shit, and now he\u2019s back in finance after SoFi booted the last CEO for being pervy.\n* One downside, he is boring as shit. He won\u2019t talk about who\u2019s a pedo, how Soros is evil or some other drama. He only talks about banking and banking accessories I tell you what. Bank Hill\n* Look at his Twitter Likes. [https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/likes](https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/likes) He knows something is brewing, and he gets a big payday if the stock hits $45.\n* Back to the company. At a recent fintech conference hosted by Piper Sandler, Noto announced that SoFi has a Net Promoter Score (how much people like the brand) of 80 for its loan business. For context, American Express has 52. The math says SoFi is literally 54% better.\n* Maybe part of the reason is because they have the naming rights to a football stadium in Los Angeles. One where little kids go to see Taylor Swift and grown ass men watch other grown ass men smack into one another. Where it\u2019s mentioned all the time for being state of the art and environmentally friendly in the largest entertainment market. WHERE THEY WILL HOST MULTIPLE WORLD CUP GAMES AND OLYMPIC SPORTS.\n* I mentioned the SPAC bagholders. They still exist and have been pounding nonstop about the stock all the way down. There are some stonk flashbacks here that are about to explode.\n\n# BUT BUT BUT\u2026\n\n* iTs pRiCeD iN \u2013 Wall Street is only getting a taste of this dildo. Once the annual shareholder meeting comes along next week and estimates come in better than expected on earnings, this next door 2 turns into a 10.\n* Student loans defaults are coming, you stupid fuck \u2013 You think the bank will let you go to Disneyland once they start asking for their money? They will garnish wages and withhold taxes on you plebs. Grow up or move to Vietnam. Or, just maybe, the stock goes up and you use the profits to pay off the ball and chain?\n* This is literally your first time posting to WSB \u2013 Yes, I\u2019m a fucking worm lurking in the shadows. This will be the one and only thesis I put out.\n* Wedbush has a PT of $3, this thing is going down \u2013 Go ahead and listen to David Chiaverini, who has a success rating of 35% and has no skin in the game [https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/david-chiaverini](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/david-chiaverini) Or me, who\u2019s about to mortgage everything because he see\u2019s asymmetric risk.\n* Why post now? \u2013 I genuinely think this will get re-rated with a soft tech valuation of $32, and we\u2019re at the cusp of it happening.\n* What will change the price \u2013 Market realization, better than expected results coming soon, major deals announced, new product releases planned this year. Literally yesterday they announced \u201cSoFi at Work\u201d, a program to allow employers to help contribute to student loan payments.\n\n# In Conclusion\n\nTake this however you want, go fuck yourself etc. If you miss the boat, DM me to sign up for a new SoFi account and get up to $275 back when you set up direct deposit.\n\nAgain I cannot stress this enough, this is not financial advice and please do your own research.\n\n\n*EDIT: Corrected some stats and added credit for deposit graphic.*",

If for some reason the supreme court doesn't block or even rule on bidens forgiveness plan which is entirely possible, sofi will drop 30% over night. Now, if you're holding a fuck load of shares and wanna wait a good 2 years, I think you'll make a ton of money. But I'm an options trader that wants money now, not later.",

I bet most of you have never come up with a unique idea on your own let alone post a write up. Rocket emojis?  Trading at highs?  That\u2019s why so many do stupid yolo plays and lose. Over and over again. \nI guess it\u2019s enough to be able to post a smart ass comment - but you can\u2019t buy food or build wealth with that. \nJust bc WSB has a rep for a more free environment it\u2019s like it\u2019s a game of who can push out the most shit out of their mouth. \n\nOP- well written. Well thought out. Most in here, sadly, couldn\u2019t trade their way out of the cardboard box they live in. \n\nInstead of seeing who can be Americas Next Too Idiot, maybe if you all shit posters were quiet you could learn a thing or two and even offer a counterpoint. The chances of that are about equal to the chances that most posting shit here have any idea what they\u2019re doing.",

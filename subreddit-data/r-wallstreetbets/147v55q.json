    "postText": "Hi everyone. 6 months ago I didnt know what ETF was or how to open an IRA so I asked right here and despite the dismissive comments, i actually got a lot of patient responses which explained and detailed what I need to know to open an IRA and invest in some ETFs. Now I want to try my hand at day trading with $1000 and I need to know a novice friendly source to get short tern trading tips. I know that first question would be: \"why not use r/wallstreetbets\" but i cant really make heads or tails of it. for example i missed the train on nvidia and palantir and Tesla bull runs. I just didnt get the memo even though i am sure they were discussed here so I need a source for daily tips. I am aware of motleyfool and tipranks and I am considering buying their premium service. any advice would be appreciated.  What is the best place to get day trading tips?",

Find a course that you like, study the fuck out of trading. Put in the hours, and you'll do good. Don't expect to get good by reading random posts or how-to strategies.  You really have to study the market,  you need to know what indicators you'll be using, when to go in a trade, when to get out at a loss/win, market season, etc. There's so much to learn, but all of it takes time and tons of studying. I practiced on paper for a full year before even putting real money, and it's a good thing I did because I would have lost money for sure. Anyway, as I said earlier,  it's best to buy a course and study/practice. Don't expect to get rich quickly. This takes years to get good. Good luck out there.",

When the market pulls back like it did in 2020, you go all in... you buy Pepsi, you buy msft, you buy HD, you buy IBM, you buy Coke, you buy aapl, ect. If it's in your refrigerator, under your sink, or in your driveway, it's probably pretty safe to invest. nfa... otherwise, dollar cost avg a low or no cost, etfs that are 4 star rated or higher. Whatever you do, don't fuk with options. Btw again, nfa i eat crayons\n\nIf you want some crayon on a Dennys menu math? You could have, for instance, as resent as January this year bought aapl for 126. 1000\u00f7126 is like what almost 8.. so you could have turned 1000 into like 1450 something. Since January. Personally, i have only ever regretted not buying more aapl. Like every single time! I should have just bought more aapl(\n\nBtw you can't 'day trade' with 1k. You need 25k minimum. Even after this, you can be flagged for pattern 'day trading' if you have too many trades in to short a time. After that, you need to worry/ learn about the 'wash rule'. GL OP, it really is a wendys dumpster fire out here..",

Also Martin Valk has created a group and an algorithm just for daytrading on discord and he shows his daily trades and how much he made. If I knew TA, I would be all over it. One day.

    "postText": "Context:  I\u2019m almost 60. Just something to think about. \n\nI\u2019ve seen two Retail FOMO\u2019s after the close today.\n\nGranted, I don\u2019t come here often. Almost never actually. Both posts seemed remarkably naive and tender. Like don\u2019t invest in anything exotic without an education. I think maybe \u201cretail FOMO\u201d might better be described as \u201cWSB FOMO\u201d. \n\nSomeone told them they could show up here and \u201cprint money\u201d.\n\nThe CNNMoney Fear Greed Index (CNNFGI) hit 75 today. \n\nI\u2019ve really just stopped by to look at the sentiment these past few days and have been astounded that people are rolling up wanting to start with options and having done **zero** homework. ChatGPT isn\u2019t going to educate them. \n\nPersonally, I found losing money to be my best teacher and I\u2019ve lost a lot. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. \n\nHow often do tenderfoots just show up and think someone can help them operate a spacecraft in one day? Is this a real thing and how has it been trending? It seems totally whacked out to me. \n\nI would love to look at newbies and their volume and value entering and exiting the market here. There will always be people entering and exiting, but living U.S. adults is a known finite number. What is the net flow for Retail relative to working Americans and relative to total market cap? Money supply is a known. That trend could print every so often. \n\nHas social media replaced humans as the teachers of the younger persons? Or, have I forgotten what it was like to be young? I actually started in options back in college or it didn\u2019t take long anyway for me to start trading options, but I was **literally** copying a friend\u2019s homework. Only I would move my strike prices out a c-hair past his. That pissed him off over time. But then he moved too and I was priced-out. We were good for each other, and I learned a lot from him. \n\nThe first OP has already deleted their post. I\u2019m thinking of Warren Buffet\u2019s fear-greed axiom chiseled into a Japanese Tsunami Stone by our ancestors.\n\nNow, we all live on the beach and pay a premium for the pleasure only to have the fabled wave come along when we think it never will and wash us all away a few times in our lifetimes, but not often enough to teach us anything. \n\nJust when I think I\u2019m out, greed \u201dpulls me back in!\u201d and rinse and repeat. I\u2019ve lost shit pots of money in my life and also made a lot too. Six figure losses by 25 (~1991 or 92 on AAPL no less IIRCC). I was just a kid playing options on Prodigy (pre-AOL). Pershing. I still remember my account number because I traded so many times a day, back in the day. My ears rang for almost a week the first time I lost $100K.\n\nI can\u2019t remember my kid\u2019s birthdays reliably, but I can type my trading account mix of numbers and letters in a tenth of a second. \n\nNow I\u2019m getting old and am having to look at a compressed horizon and reevaluate risk across my remaining years. It\u2019s a weird place to find myself. \n\nKids all got nice college funds. Their accounts actually out performed mine because I was a little more cautious. Pissed me off. Not really. Maybe a little. They bought their first rental home together at 15 &amp; 18. Used it all the way through college and made $167K off of their first real estate play. That\u2019s another story. \n\nEveryone becomes a bear \u2026 \u2026 someday. Mark my words. I\u2019m pushing 60. I lived through an entire lost decade in the 70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s. That shit hurts on the one hand, but I made money playing options by my mid 20\u2019s even during the S&amp;L Crisis. You can always make money. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the \u201cstonks only go up\u201d crowd that were crowing the last time I visited. I think these are neophytes rolling up with a wad of cash to fuel the last melt up.\n\nAnd it looks like the WSB tenor now has the _voice-of-experience_ reminding others about unforeseen dildos and the predictable lack of lubricant. It\u2019s a different WSB. Just saying. \n\nSpeaking of sayings, the saying that stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down isn\u2019t really true for the \u201cbiggies\u201d.\n\nFor a Biggie, there is always the Space Shuttle Columbia that appears at the last moment and returns with this final entry into the mission commanders log: \u201cFate: disintegrated during re-entry\u201d.\n\nA lot of people will lose their money trying to time the event. That\u2019s the circle of life. If I make bank in derivatives, someone else lost and vice versa. Not always true in stocks and bonds. \n\nFear and Greed fornicate every trade in the options markets. There will be greedy put sellers in the last days. Winners and losers. Nothing like it except war. It\u2019s binary. Steel on steel. \n\nAnyway, naive retail FOMO\u2019s rolling up gives my guh bear SPYdr Senses a woody.\n\nYou don\u2019t get many opportunities to short the shit out the market in an entire lifetime. \n\nEvery trader dreams of The Big One!  Might be an opportunity before EoY. Maybe. \n\nOP is probably the nicest person in the world showing up 10 minutes before a lopsided game ends after paying full price for the ticket. He didn\u2019t notice he was actually walking past all the smart people leaving before the rush. \n\nMaybe?\n\nIf I were licensed to give advice, I might recommend 5% bonds and wake up every day and watch Bloomberg and CNBC, watch ALL news channels, even (or especially) the ones that you don\u2019t agree with and always watch the after market analysis.\n\nRead Buffet\u2019s work. Relax and dip the toe in in small chunks so the education they will acquire losing money hand over fist won\u2019t be quite as expensive. Read Bobbleheads and separate retirement from investments from speculation and be diligent about not needing the speculative money. Consider it dead when you put it in and divorce yourself from emotions, but be competitive about winning so you do the work. The cardinal rule is you can\u2019t play without money. Pure speculation is pure gambling in a lopsided house. Schmucks will _\u201dborrow\u201d_ from retirement and investment accounts. That\u2019s a bad idea. \n\nIf he took the advice, maybe by the time they jumped in the market might be oversold. \n\nI think the mods should graph retail FOMO for us on a weekly basis. \n\nMaybe not. WSB would probably alter market sentiment. It\u2019s all a self-fulfilling prophecy then and it would be divorced from reality. Inversing the inverse seems to be a super power around here. When WSB gets frothy, unnatural acts are preformed on the secondary market.\n\nI have devised a WSB Idiot Trap using the 1st flair option. \u201cWSB FOMO: How to trade options with No experience!\u201d.\n\nBot thrashes them, points them to some resources, then auto deletes their messages. \n\nThe bot then gives us the sucker count and trends inside of subject line that literally says, \u201cWSB subreddit traffic statistics\u201d\n\nSetup a couple of flair traps and see if the data means anything.\n\nI like the perceived (mine) of this sub. I would love to see a data cube on WSB sentiment that could be trapped by a bot. \n\nEvery post requires [Nu, Be, Bu] for neutral, bullish, or bearish. That bot data could be powerful if it trended.",

Gas lines. \n\nAnd, racial bigotry. Just because the Civil Rights Act past the year I was born didn\u2019t mean everything was suddenly different. \n\nShit. How naive to you have to be to think I could see the impact on my Depression Era parents, English second language, no education, struggling. \n\nI lived through 12% interest. I effing bought my second vehicle at a 14.5 handle. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a adult to experience life. Our children don\u2019t remember 9/11, but they remember 2008z\n\nThey lived through that. \n\nI grew up in a military town next to Fort Hood. Google Peeples Elementary on Google Maps. \n\nSee that giant 1st Cav heliport literally across from my elementary school. I experienced Vietnam as well. \n\nKids getting called out of class when shit happened. Jane Fonda coming to town. Jimmy Carter came to town. \n\nWe didn\u2019t hang out on SnapChat and Tinder all day. Only three channels. We rode bikes behind the mosquito trucks. Didn\u2019t wear seat belts and watched Vietnam and the Middle East conflicts live everyday at 6:00 PM.\n\nYou can take my opinion or leave it. I\u2019m just telling you ancestors leave Tsunami Stones for their grandchildren because they have learned the lesson.\n\nHard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times. \n\nHard times are coming. That\u2019s why so said to keep an eye on what is going on. If a serious melt up occurs with retail replacing smart money at the top, you can find opportunities in the predictable chaos. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend heavy margin plays, but you do you.  \n\nI moved our retirement funds into bonds just before the close today. \n\nThere is like a 65% of a steep sell off in the next 9 weeks. \n\nBut, if that doesn\u2019t happen and instead it really heats up, I think the odds of a strong correction with a negative bias for months to replace the bulk market. \n\nIt\u2019s just my opinion. You have yours and I have mine. I found the C19 play on Reddit and got out and in close to peak and bottom. I also shorted and made so shekels, but left 80% of the potential gains on the table by taking profits too soon.\n\nI see an entirely different opportunity now and came to test the thesis. I am generally a market contrarian, but I honestly don\u2019t know what to make of the WSB sentiment.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is the chaos I see:\n\nhttps://www.thehistoryville.com/mansa-musa-richest-man-history/\n\nIt\u2019s a great story. Printer goes brrrrrrrrr? Eventually, the bar tab comes due and it will be paid by someone to someone. \n\nI want to be the payee, not the payer. I am too old to hold through an extended period of negative returns. \n\nLife and Opportunity can be charted against one another with (life) options on the Y-axis and t (time) charted on the X-axis. \n\nI can\u2019t see a reference to it on a Google search, but I studied it in my 20\u2019s just out of B-school. It was by Boston Consulting Group and I haven\u2019t forgotten the lesson. \n\nMy t (time) is limited, ergo, so are my own (life) options because life options decline over time. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t put in the effort earlier, it is unlikely you can shift gears and become a doctor at 40 and get your entire investment in a medical doctor\u2019s license.\n\nThe inverse is true. Zoom out just a little bit and think about how to squeeze bank out of the inverse. \n\nI am basically telegraphing my play here. If a true melt up occurs, then I will no doubt hear Alan Greenspan whispering in my ear, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2013/10/24/what-alan-greenspan-learned-from-the-2008-crisis/amp/\n\nHow old were you when the Dot Com Bubble burst?\n\nDo you know what market euphoria looks like or sounds like? It sounds like \u201cstonks only go up\u201d and \u201cprinter goes brrrrrr\u201d.  \n\nIn the last days, it will sound like, \u201cHey, I feel like I I missing out, I want to put all my money in the printer\u201d.\n\nI just wanted to get a sense for the latter. \n\nEither you\u2019re going to take my money or I am going to take yours. \n\nTell you what. When I reenter the market, we can whip them out and see whose is bigger. \n\nPeace and good luck. \n\nBTW: What\u2019s your thesis?",

People who truly invest in stocks get rewarded.\n\nEvery seasoned investor/trader can tell you a story how they had a plethora of stocks at very low prices but decided to sell after holding for small gains either because of fear or felt like they needed to cash in some meesley gains. \n\nHow many of you at one time have owned shares of Tesla, apple, Kla, ASML, enphase, applied materials, Facebook, google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, amd, nvda at infintile stages in their stock price lives and say to yourself \"only if I would have held for 10 years\"\n\nPeople who invest in America long term get rewarded, more times then not \n\nThat is the best advice you will ever get .\n\nOk now the funny people can start now with typical wsb sayings....let's here it, the big money controllers are feasting on you...yes just like the casino.",

The clarity and ability to consume massive amounts of reading. I\u2019m not sleepy at all. Just a rocket vibrating at 50G\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019ve not done well on meds. Like most BP, I\u2019m off except for trazo 100 mg at bedtime and Rx THC.\n\nI sleep better but still get to let my mind race. Sorry for the overly verbose speech. Fast, excessive language is definitely one of my personal BP liabilities. \n\nOn net, I consider it an asset though. \n\nPeace and good luck!",

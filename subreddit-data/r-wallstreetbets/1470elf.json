    "postText": "In response to the Swiss National Regulator compelling UBS to absorb all of Credit Suisse's toxic debts, UBS will postpone their 2023 Q2 earnings until August 31.  During late July and early August, investors historically begin pulling money out of the market to temporarily cover large purchases before putting money back in markets around late August and early September. \n\nAs a result, UBS stock will likely experience lower liquidity with the rest of the markets around early to mid August, which would be a very good setup for shorting the stock going into earnings. \n\nUBS derives most of its money from emerging markets and uses a top-down model for its business. With India and Poland stock markets relatively flat with recently low volatility, Q2 earnings will not present well with investors. Because of this and negative sentiment from Swiss nationals related to a big bank absorbing a failed Credit Suisse creating a monopoly, I have no choice but to buy UBS 20.5 strike put options expiring November 22 2023 a few days before UBS releases earnings.",

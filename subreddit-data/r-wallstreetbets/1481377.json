With long dated options, timing doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. A 60-90dte call can handle a few sideways weeks in an uptrend. \n\nBut, in this type of market with a one or two day l, maybe a week small pull backs, the timing is a lot more essential. The average bull market lasts ~5 years, while bear markets closer to ~years. So barring some catastrophe, we will not be entering true bear market territory any time soon.\n\nDoesn\u2019t exclude scalping pullbacks, but that is a lot more risky than longer dated calls in an uptrend.",

In responding through tax policy, there is a risk policy mistakes in attempts to rapidly address inflation.

Young adults can\u2019t afford sky high house payments when they are paying sky high loans in their education.  That will kill housing which kills household formation which kills all other industries.  If media has taught me one thing, Millennials are really good at killing things.\n\nMillennials are in the middle of their peak household formation years.  Which is why we are seeing inflation stick so hard. \n\nBut you don\u2019t need to buy a new fridge, buy fertilizer for the yard, remodel a bathroom or buy a network router and a ring doorbell when you live in your parents basement paying off your student loans.  You definitely won\u2019t need any baby clothes when your only steady girlfriend is a fleshlight that you stash in your closet to hide it from your mom.",

But you can definitely see some wrinkles if there isn't enough volume LOL. \n\nIt shouldn't radically influence the market on the longer term, though, because the net result of the overnight trades will basically reflect futures trades and foreign trades anyway.",

I've been there buddy.\n\n\nIf she's waiting for you to be on a work trip, there's a high chance she had a dude on the side for a while and she's gonna pretend that she just met him. It's not want you want to hear. It probably hurts more. But it's the truth.\n\n\nOr, she's not happy and wants to work on the relationship. But imma be honest that's not seeming likely. If she does end things, use that time to figure out what you want in life. Post-breakup self reflection is a good thing honestly. Focus on yourself for the next little bit. It sounds like a meme, but hit the gym, or pick up a sport, or do some physical hobby. It helps to have something where you can just let your unga bunga caveman brain take over for a bit.\n\n\nRegardless, don't go chasing her now. Shoot her a message saying you wish she would have told you that earlier,  that you want to work on things with her (assuming you do), and leave it at that. Throw the ball in her court and be ready to walk away if you need to.",

Description:

Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.

Rules:

Avoid Purely Political Discussion: We're here to make money trading the markets. 

Purely political discussion is boring and gets in the way of that.

Comments and posts that don't explicitly relate things back to the market will be removed.

Screenshots of Social Media Posts are Prohibited: Screenshots or links to social media (Tweets, Reddit Comments, etc.) are not allowed unless they are *new* and *market moving*. 

For example, Elon Musk tweeting "Funding secured at $420 to take Tesla private" was both new and market moving at the time, and would be allowed. 

However, Elon Musk tweeting "we need to increase oil &amp; gas output immediately" is not market moving, and would not be allowed.

We also don't want to see posts like "he's one of us!" or "more visibility for this comment!"

Market Cap Must Be Above $500MM USD: To avoid pump &amp; dumps, we only allow stocks above a $500MM market cap.

We hate restricting conversation, and will periodically adjust this threshold based on subreddit behavior, aiming to reduce it whenever possible.

To avoid stocks flipping between allowed and not allowed, we have a bot that will unspam tickers when their market cap is above $500MM and re-spam them immediately after they sink to under 400MM, or if they have been below $500MM for some time.

Keep Threads Interesting, Otherwise Use the Daily!: If your submission isn't all that useful, funny, long, or unique, and is primarily text... well, it should've been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission.

Note: Discussion threads can steer clear of this by bringing some information to the table, being more than a ticker and a question mark, etc.

YOLOs Must Be Above $10K or $25K (Options, Shares): We're here to see off the wall wacky trades and small $100 trades just don't cut it.

**YOLO posts** must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares. 

Please make sure to include the actual position or trade in the screenshot.

Gains and Losses Must Be Above $2.5K or $5K (Options, Shares): We're here to see big risk taking and small $100 trades just don't cut it.

**Gain/Loss posts** must show gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

Remember the golden rule: If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close.

Gains and Losses Must Be Realized: Gain/Loss posts should be realized before posting, or in the case of options, the options should be expiring soon. (Ideally within 2 days)

Remember the golden rule: If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close.

Only Crypto Allowed is BTC and ETH: To avoid excessively shilly / low quality content, we restrict crypto discussion to only Bitcoin and Ethereum

These are the two products that the CME offers futures on. If CME expands their offering, this rule will expand in lockstep.

Passing mention of other cryptocurrencies is fine, but we kindly ask that you take purely crypto discussion (other than BTC/ETH) elsewhere.

Avoid Pump &amp; Dumps, Short Squeezes, and Market Manipulation: Extremely low volume equities may be blocked as they are easily susceptible to pump &amp; dump schemes.

Threads solely about "fucking the hedgies" by doing a short squeeze, will also be removed. The odds of success are vanishingly low, and most of the time OP is just trying to get you to buy their bags.

False or misleading information posted to manipulate the price of a security is prohibited. Any activity of this sort is against securities law.

No Bullshitting - Only Comment If You Know What You're Talking About: Don't make shit up, and be responsible giving and taking advice. This includes talking about things you don't know about. You should listen, not talk. Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion.

Paper trades don't count as real trades and are forbidden as standalone posts. Nobody gives a shit about your preschool's trading competition, don't ask us for help.

Please Don't Derail Discussion by Brigading, Spreading Hate, or Downvoting Everyone: If you came here from another sub specifically to talk about other subs, downvote indiscriminately, or spew hate against the sub, it will get you banned. 

Don't go do it to other subs either. We will find out and ban you from here.

Don't Shit on the Community: Some level of poking fun at the subreddit is fine. We know how to laugh at ourselves. 

This becomes a problem however, when you let light hearted joking cross the line into malice and hatred. 

If you are only here to shit on r/wallstreetbets then you will be shown the door.

No Advertisement, Self-Promotion, Fundraising, or Begging: No affiliate/referral links, trading services, market education shilling, Patreons, mailing lists, or anything even vaguely similar.

Glorifying Losses is Unacceptable: We're here to make money. That's it.

Losing money happens, it's a part of trading. Sharing that experience helps make discussion more authentic, makes people realize the dangers of trading, and serves as a starting point for figuring out what went wrong.

Glorifying losses is completely unacceptable. Encouraging certain loss trades, except as a joke, will be met with a permanent ban. 

We're here to make money. Don't get it twisted.

The first was at 45% capacity.  The second was at 85%.  The third was at almost 100%.  I've seen lots of anecdotal data that near full cruises are a thing again AND the prices have been going up.\n\nOnly potentially scary thing with CCL is the amount of debt they took on over the past 3 years.  I did well with cruises after the big hit in March.  Easy doubles on CCL and NCHL.  RCL did well too, just not as well as those two.\n\nBoomers going to boom.  They love cruises and they need to spend their money on something.",

            "comment": "Ok, so here are all the reason I like the stock and my cursory analysis:\n\nTLDR, good cash on hand, good leadership, record breaking bookings.\n\nIndustry\n\n- 2023 has shown that Cruises are here to stay, people want a cheap, \"Exotic\", all-inclusive vacations. Even if we hit a recession, we aren't there yet\n\n- RCL had a major beat and cited almost 40% more demand than expected\n\n- Prices have increased and all the major cruise lines have had record breaking bookings\n\n\nWhy Carnival?\n\n- New-ish CEO (Weinstein) with 20 years at the company and was instrumental in keep the company afloat through the 2020-2022 as the COO\n\n-  Recent (5/ re-org of their 6 main lines into their own brands each with their own heads that have direct access to Weinstein, this means that each once can define itself within their respective verticals and respond more quickly\n\n- Weinstein was quoted in May that during the previous WAVE season, they had the most bookings in THE HISTORY OF THE COMPANY, on both their North American AND European lines, also that he doesn't see signs of the momentum slowing\n\n- Weinstein said they had a plan moving forward to address the debt\n\n- They have 6B in cash, easily enough to pay the quarterly debt payments for the next 3 years and cover operational costs, even at slight loss. \n\n- They previously (2019) had a lot of ships (24) on order that they needed to finance, this is no longer the case and they can just use existing assets\n\n- They have several solid plans to increase onboard spending, which has great margins\n\n- No recent insider selling \n\nWhat about the 30B in Debt and the share Dilution?\n\n- As far as the share dilution goes, based on how many were outstanding in 2019, if all things were equal, we would see a share price of around $35\n\n- They have around 20B more in long-term debt than they did in 2019, but have a plan to increase Free cash flow (FCF) with direct plans to pay this down aggressively over the next 18months. Even with the debt outstanding as it is today, however, I still get a rough estimate share price of around $17-$22\n\nWhy THIS Earnings?\n\n- There is a gap here IMO between sentiment and reality. Most people see the debt and think the company is floundering, they are expected to post a loss of around 0.55 a share, but I believe in reality they could be much closer to breaking even or even going slightly positive. My estimate is -0.25-0.1 EPS\n\n- They will almost certainly raise guidance, leading to a sharp spike in price.",

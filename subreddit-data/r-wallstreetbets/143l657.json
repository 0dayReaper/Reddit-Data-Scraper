OTM puts are a ripoff, and you have to go fairly ITM to get anything that makes sense. I'd go with ITM puts on QQQ or stick with ATM/ITM calls on SQQQ in super low quantities (because... you know... it's 3x and already super potent) and in small windows (because you already recognize that it has time decay and you'll lose your ass if you linger in a position too long).",

In this environment and level of IV skew, debit spreads are the way to go, with a long leg ITM and short leg ATM or slight OTM. Now, time/theta is on your side, instead of against you. Herky jerky PA also gets smoothed out a bit, and you even get a bit of a reach around if things don't go your way and price moves against you (but you have to be sure to eject as soon as your long leg hits ATM).",

Slightly ITM makes more sense on SQQQ as well right now... But go easy... Because you're basically buying options on options, and that shit will buck.",

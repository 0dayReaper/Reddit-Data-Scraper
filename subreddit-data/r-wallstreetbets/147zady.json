You may have assumed otherwise for whatever reason. \n\nA risk manager is rendering a service. I don\u2019t know whether that means they should be paid more. It depends on how valuable the service is.\n\nThere are a handful of people who are born with genetic disorders and they aren\u2019t inherently more valuable just because there are vastly more people who are born without genetic disorders. \n\nI personally doubt whether a risk manager is rendering a greater service than a plumber, and he is only seemingly useful because in my opinion he perpetuates the FIAT system. He is valuable to that system, but I think the system as a whole will inevitably be replaced. Better than what was, worse than what could be. From a broader perspective his position has no value because the FIAT system, relative to this hypothetical \u2018better\u2019 system, is useless. \n\nThe goal should be eliminating risk, not \u2018managing\u2019 it. You don\u2019t need banks if people don\u2019t steal and if they want to help each other out. Even if that goal is unrealistic, we tends toward that outcome as each year goes by. \n\nCultures like Japan have very low incidence of crime, so we have a litmus test for the fact that culture can affect crime rates. In my opinion, AI has the potential to be a better governor than whatever governments we have now, so combine these aspects and the very concept of a risk manager seems worthless. \n\nA comprehensive answer to your declarations would require a longer one, but I hope this has been satisfactory. Even if you disagree with me, I hope you can understand where I\u2019m coming from.",

Value refers here to monetary value, not concrete, actual effect on the world, which is utility. Both are not the same. A plumber can reconnect the washing machine in a 10-yo abandoned house with no electricity and in total disrepair or the washing machine in your home. \n\nThere is no way those two works has the same concrete effect, in its full scope of analysis on human life. However, they were the exact same. It is easy to see that work has no intrinsic utility and monetary value, it is all dependent on the context, which is exactly what the Marxist Theory of Labor misses. 1 hour of digging a trench in Siberia in a labour camp does not have the same value as 1 hour of labour digging a trench in the frontline in Stalingrad.",

Wage stagnation has kept some prices artificially lower because by keeping the wages low it kept costs lower, but didn't keep them stagnated like the wages of the worker.\n\nBut remember, poors need to stay poor. If potential customers start having more disposable income it would be disastrous for the entire consumer based economy because most will take that money and spend it. They would develop silly attitudes such as happiness and peace of mind from being able to acquire things out of their reach which might lead to increased productivity at work. I mean Ford doubled wages for his workers in the early 20th century and it basically killed the company.... /s",

Increasing the supply of money while the demand stays the same is a recipe for the US dollar to tank overseas and inflation plus more.\n\nSo yea I\u2019m not disagreeing that printing money cant solve the problem I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a terrible solution.  \n\nOn the topic of money being \u201cfake\u201d. \n\nEverything relating to the fundamental concept of ownership is just a belief.

If people lose trust in the financial system then everything collapses.\n\nSo yes you may be technically right the money is \u201cfake\u201d however this does not change the fact that belief in the financial system is the bedrock for why we even go to work every morning.",

When we retain value in something with scarcity, and particularly with necessity, then it does have a tangible worth. If we used a limited supply of oxygen as currency rather than FIAT, then I guarantee nobody would need the mental gymnastics. Economics spring from barter, which is a fundamental and adaptive trade in value. I think likely the best system for humanity is a blend of the two systems, where you have easy fungibility, scarcity, and are not trading with a human necessity like shelter or whatever.\n\nThe benefit of the FIAT system is they can use the shitty solution we are talking about. It's horrid and creates ever increasing wealth inequality, but it won't specifically tip over whilst the fed have control of the printer and a willingness to let the poorest starve just enough while not busting out the guillotines.\n\nAlso the government have other levers they can pull which are now well understood. If the bread and circus approach doesn't function then worst case you hit the war or xenophobia button. By keeping people uneducated and overworked they don't have the capacity to lose faith in the monetary system, since the philosophical concept of it not being real will always lose out to it being a requirement for food on the table. At this point it's a very efficient and adaptive system that's got a pretty solid foundation and I think it can survive far more debt than is there right now.\n\nIt does look though by the amount of gold being hoarded by international reserve banks that things are at least a little wobbly, and the active efforts by competing powers to issue new reserve currencies, as well as the growing presence of BTC etc. is a warning signal \n\nWho the fuck knows. Either way it IS faerie dust",

Some interest is government to government, and not particularly meaningful, but a great deal of it is being paid to treasury bond holders who use that money to procure real goods and services which dilutes the buying power of all the dollars people are paid at their jobs. Your earned dollars are competing with the guy in Saudi Arabia holding $1T of treasury bonds getting a fat 5.5% short term rate. He's getting $55B a year, which can be used to buy real estate, groceries, wood, oil, whatever he wants essentially for free just for holding a government note.",

You could just create something like a social wealth fund, create money into it as needed and not create an artificial liability, or create the liability and give the ownership of the asset to the fund itself.",

He knew that if it didn\u2019t go above $240 by 48 hours he would lose it all.  \n\n\nFortunately, during the time of the screenshot, TSLA was trading around $249, his prediction that TSLA would exceed $240 was correct with a value of $9 per option contract, he paid $1.26 per.  \n\nHe didn\u2019t exercise the option because he doesn\u2019t have the funds to do so.\n\nInstead, he just sold the options to someone else who probably exercised it, not that it matters to him.\n\nSo basically, the stock (underlying) went up 10% in 48 hours &amp; the odds of predicting that correctly is highly unlikely, therefore the large payday.  Again, he has 48 hours since he chose that timeframe to sell (close) them at whatever value he wishes but since time is the enemy, if the stock does not move in the direction he thinks then his call option will rapidly lose value as the market will see it more &amp; more unlikely to reach the 240 mark.  Vice versa, because the stock began to rise, his option begun to increase in value as it became more &amp; more likely to reach &amp; exceed that mark.",

The guy that did \u201copen to sell\u201d (who collected $1.26 from OP), later on needs to \u201cbuy to close\u201d to get out of the contract.  He basically needs to buy OP\u2019s options back if he wants keep his TSLA stock, if doesn\u2019t do this then when OP played hot potato, then he will need to fulfill his contract &amp; liquidate his TSLA stock at $240 to whomever OP sold to.",

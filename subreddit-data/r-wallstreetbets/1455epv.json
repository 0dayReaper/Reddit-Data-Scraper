Make some fake options trades, make money, lose money, see how with options you can have large gains, and large losses. Start with LONG calls and puts.

Only trade with money you have and no credit. Starting trading options with margin, and doing things like shorting, can put you in a huge negative and can literally put you into huge debt in 1 day.",

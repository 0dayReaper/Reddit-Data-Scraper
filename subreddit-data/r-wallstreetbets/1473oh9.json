We all collectively were tipping 20% standard to give waiters their wages because we knew restaurant owners were paying them far below minimum wage and we had to provide for them instead. \n\nNow that real wages are covered by the price of the item we can actually tip waiters on service instead. Me ordering 4 $10 drinks requires far more back and forth service than one $40 entr\u00e9e. Makes way more sense to tip $10 on the drinks (25%) than $8 on the entr\u00e9e since I\u2019m already paying for their wages in the price of the food. Personally, I\u2019ve gotten more help and service from Home Depot employees in many cases than waiters and they are not even allowed to accept tips (I\u2019ve tried)\n\nAt one point in time I lived in London for 2 years and tipping at restaurants was not done nor was it expected. There wasn\u2019t even an option when they would bring the card machines to you. The wages for waiters are already covered by the price of food and it\u2019s as expensive a city as San Francisco. \n\nTipping 20% is starting to become excessive knowing wages are already covered by food prices and almost every restaurant in SF already adds 5% as a line item for employee health insurance",

We will pause because we made this narrative but please don\u2019t pay attention to the volume of cheap puts that someone *cough* is buying because we love paying you out on your YOLO bets!\u201d\n\nI am going to call it now. CPI will beat, rally will continue into Wednesday before FOMC meeting and we hear that contrary to financial pundits, the FED points to all the reports beating estimates and previous advice from Powell that he will not pause unless the reports are not strong enough to warrant one.\n\nSo Wall Street will rug the market pretending they didn\u2019t expect another hike while they profit from selling their stocks for profit, panicking retail to sell for losses, and print on puts they had, hedging for the rally.",

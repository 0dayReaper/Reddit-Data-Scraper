    "postText": "Ok trying to keep it simple so here goes. While AI will certainly change things, it ain\u2019t the proverbial \u201cend of the working man\u201d. \n\nConsider this:  In the 1950s and 1960s, jet travel was FASTER than it is today. That\u2019s right, your New York to LA trip was shorter then than it is now. Why? Because of the classic Law of Diminishing Returns. It\u2019s unprofitable and wasteful due to the amount of extra fuel it takes to go above the current speeds of air travel. \nWe\u2019ve seen this in other industries as well. 40 years ago it was robotic automation in manufacturing that was going to replace jobs of laborers. Well guess what, it\u2019s too expensive and capital intensive to fully automate everything so the industry has a balance point of some automation for heavy and very repetitive and dangerous tasks, and then manual labor for the rest.\n\nSo what does this have to do with AI?  Again, cost. Expensive servers, routine replacement and obsolescence factors, and other related capital requirements will put a ceiling on the how much peoples work will actually be able to be removed completely. \n\nWill it change things? Absolutely. But be ready when it gets frothy to make some bank.",

The rest, on a good day, was entirely automated all the way from forklifts unloading pallets of plastic bottles to forklifts loading the trucks up with ranch. This level of automation has allowed the factory to keep a small footprint relative to its output, and more importantly, allows hidden valley ranch to operate only 2 factories for their entire company. That\u2019s it. All the hidden valley ranch in the world comes from two factories with the combined footprint of a football field thanks to heavy investment in automation. \n\nThis allows them to hire young people with no college, and train them on machines for certifications, with concrete pay raises in each, which has allowed their small pool of employees to make middle class income and be loyal. Most the people had been there for 4+ years and many over a decade. Automation for them, has allowed the factory worker job to be a safe and profitable one",

From warehouses to prototype manufacturing, everything can be shrunk down to a minimal workforce. I saw entire shifts being fully handled by automation, for example the cleaning processes in breweries. I saw farmer seed distribution plants being controlled from a single person at home, with noone on the spot for months, a plant that had a prior workforce of about 50 shiftworkers. In manufacturing, you can sent in your CAD files and get a finished product shipped home with close to 0 human interaction. There might be benefits to let an engineer have a look at the files first but quite often you take the responsibility if you sent garbage in. Companies that haven't even started with the process yet, will not be competitive in the near future.",

Companies don't invest millions into automation to replace humans. Companies buy automation to increase production and increase the quality of their products. \n\nThere are literally thousands of machines on drawing boards that can replace almost every single job. Guess what? They never get built. Why? Because its way easier to just hire some random dipshit.

If you look at the last 3 years for your valuation you will always arrive at high cashflow low growth companies. If a company with a growth of 142% per year matches those cashflows and after that has higher cashflows and growth that company is worth more. Look at  AT&amp;T that had 29B cashflow in 2019 that you would value at 40% of Apple right? Oh sh\\*t it went down to 16B in 2022. Actual \ud83e\udd21.",

You could for example decide to pay out 100% of those earnings as a dividend.\n\nFiat currencies are completely unrelated to the stock market and are mostly represented in the forex market.\n\nStocks are equity securities and I'm not aware why you would mention it here because we talked about stocks which are equity securities.

The American then remarked that they should use spoons to make even more jobs \n\nPoint being that industry, automation, and innovation shouldn\u2019t be sidelined. \n\nI agree with you though. A lot of things to get done right and unfortunately the right thing goes against the interests of the people who can misuse it. I remain hopeful though. Humanoid robot projects look very promising right now and will be the true job killer in the next decade. As the general public slowly realize that there really are no jobs that are safe there will be unrest, and from unrest, political will for change rises. There will be a critical moment between mass unrest and corporate lobbyists they we can see true, wonderful change that satisfies both company interests and the general populace\n\nOr like you said. Things will get better for us in some ways but it is is disproportionate to others. Probably more likely",

As well as paralysis injuries being mitigated and people walking again. There are also promises for other neurological diseases such as dementia and Alzheimers.\n\nSmart prosthetics could easily integrate with BCI and have it feel like the limb was never missing with perfect sync between robot limb and the brain. This is even more compounded when some prosthetics are getting sensors on the hands and then training them what things feel like, so that one day someone with prosthetic limb could grab something without seeing it and know what it is and what it feels like \n\nBeyond that, robots in healthcare/surgery in general is exciting. I was an army medic before going into tech and I know the major impact of cheap scalable AI and robots with better care giving capabilities will have on the world. What billionaires have today, the average person will have better. And when healthcare sees so much automation, I\u2019d like to see better social policy.

As long as your vision issues aren\u2019t from trauma essentially. As well as reanimating paralyzed limbs. We\u2019ve seen non-invasive solutions to long term paralyzation injuries, I would imagine a brain implant communicating with a spinal cord implant as BCI companies have talked about, would be even more effective. In my mind, if that\u2019s possible, and after watching tests of people/monkeys using computers with their minds faster than manual controls, then an implant community with a prosthetic limb seems very much within the realm of possibility \n\nWhile my neuroscience knowledge is limited and I\u2019m ready to be corrected on the above, I am no stranger to machine learning and how it can be applied to quickly train sensor input to be interpreted correctly. It won\u2019t be tomorrow or even within a year, but sensors on prosthetic limbs that know what they are touching is possible. Getting that information to the brain and have it interpreted by the brain correctly is the hard part\n\nhttps://www.atomlimbs.com/waitlist?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=14993928384&amp;utm_content=133902952732&amp;utm_term=atom%20limbs&amp;gad=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvfGKgMy-_wIVLgizAB06MAbeEAAYASAAEgLH7vD_BwE\n\nHere\u2019s a link to a company working on such a prosthetic that I found a year ago.

You will see more work being automated during this time, you'll see office 365, followed by a huge pause in hiring and an introduction to ubi. \n\nAfter that point, I do not know and we can go two ways. Either we end up automating more of our necessities such as food production and labour intensive roles whilst advancing and allocating more research and time into medical roles. Or the nastier outcome, we end up filling these labour intensive roles and only get paid enough to get by whilst corporations dictate our lives.\n\n In either case I see us ending in a system regulated by machines, I just hope we don't become a hive mind",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman aspiring to major in nursing. I recently got placed into Math Level 1 (which is fine) but I haven\u2019t taken normal math in two years so I don\u2019t know much basic math (pre calc). Additionally, if I do bad in this math class it will lower my gpa for the nursing program requirements. Should I ask to level down in placement or will it set me back?",

At least that was my experience when I was a freshman. Yo can easily just go on khan academy or go and watch the organic chemistry tutor on YouTube. That\u2019s what I did during freshman year cause tbh math professors especially for lecture are not the best. They often left me more confused. So I usually just watched a YouTube video on the topic and barley went or even paid attention during lecture. But for recitation clases those classes are golden professors for recitation are almost always better than the ones teaching lecture.",

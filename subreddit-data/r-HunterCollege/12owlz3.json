            "comment": "No program is perfect but I recommend it. Social work is a mix of psychology, sociology, and advocacy. The classes reflect that in their behavioral (where you learn some models and theories / micro, mezzo, macro levels), clinical classes (where you can learn some psych, talk about struggles in internship, and focus on/gain self awareness), policy classes, and specific method/track courses. Getting internship placement may be a little difficult for some. But I still stand by the major and encourage others to go for it.\n\nI'm an alum who did the BSW ('20) and MSW ('21), feel free to message any time. Currently just started working at a hospital. Will reply when I have time.",

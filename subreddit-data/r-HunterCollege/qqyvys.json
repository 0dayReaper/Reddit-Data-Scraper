But transferring to Hunter is much easier. \n\nOne tip I can say is when applying for Hunter, choose \"undecided\" because if you choose a major, it's harder to get in.",

However, they will prob be more thorough with your GPA and extracurricular activities to make up for the lack of SAT score.    \n\n\nFor most people I would have to agree that Hunter is pretty easy to get into, same w other CUNYs. if you're interested in Macalauy Honors - that's a lot more competitive.",

            "comment": "FYI: I\u2019m an environmental studies major so my fave classes are in that field lol.\n\nGeog 226 (environmental conservation and resource management)- i loved professor Campos. He brings a sort of liveliness to the class and is so human. The course was really informative and he helps students not sit in the doom and gloom of climate change and helps us see the good things that happen from conservation efforts. Also grading wise he was pretty easy if you show you put in effort.\n\nPGeog 38366 (field ecology of New York)- professor Reinmann is the best! A bit of stickler when it comes to writing assignments, but he\u2019s really knowledgeable about his stuff. You learn about native plants and trees and class was almost always outside. At the end of the semester we took a field trip up to black rock forest and had a taste of field work measuring trees and comparing them to disturbed forest sites. We also ate s\u2019mores around a campfire so that was fun.",

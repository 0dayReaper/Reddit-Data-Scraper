I managed to meet the SAP requirements again after the fall 2022 semester but I still have a hold for the spring 2023 semester. I went to the financial aid office and I was told that the grades that I got from the 2021-2022 year are counted towards the 2022-2023 year and that the grades from the fall 2022 and spring 2023 semester are counted towards the 2023-2024 year. I'm confused as to how this makes any sense at all as I literally am meeting the requirements to be eligible for financial aid but Hunter is telling me that I am not. Once you get put onto academic probation you are just screwed for the next year when it comes to financial aid?\n\nHas anyone been put on academic probation and got back their financial aid the next semester before?",

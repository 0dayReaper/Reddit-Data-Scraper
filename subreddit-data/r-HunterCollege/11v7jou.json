Everything at hunter takes awhile so you'll just have to wait. if you're unhappy w your math milestone you can take the math placement test. \n\nFor more info: [https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/testingcenter/math-milestones](https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/testingcenter/math-milestones)\n\nIf you're confident in your math skills would rec you taking it sooner than later since a lot more people sign up after they get their math milestone is released.\n\nAlso, if you're not taking ap calc and is taking hs calc there's a possibility of getting placed in precalc w/o a placement exam.",

If you score high you are Not allowed to take lower level classes instead and they all fit the same basic requirements. \n\nI'm an English major and even though I like math and I think I'm pretty good at it, I'd rather have an A+ in math 102 than struggle in a calculus class lmao",

I've taken both, different semesters due to my personal reasoning. If it's just an intro to the class, it's not the hardest material to learn. However, work can be difficult and maybe something you want to rethink. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone is different. I work too, and for me, I can't commit to a lot of studying when work is so stressful already. Last semester when I was online I had plenty of time which is why I took more classes and 2 hard ones at the same time. It all depends on you, of course, best of luck!",

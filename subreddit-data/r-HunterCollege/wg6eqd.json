Will every single one of my credits transfer from St. John\u2019s to Hunter in the computer science track? Or will I have to retake classes? If anyone is a transfer student here, what was your experience like when transferring credits?",

What\u2019s important is that your school is accredited. Transferring over isn\u2019t really hard but I would say definitely speak to the financial aid department or any staff member that\u2019s familiar with the process so that you can transfer your way in smoothly. I transferred this past winter (2022) and for the most part, it really wasn\u2019t that complicated.",

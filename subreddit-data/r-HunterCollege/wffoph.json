I am a first-year student, and I try very hard to choose the best lecture hours and professors, but in life, we don't always get what we want. On the Rate my professor website, I saw that my CSCI professor was not found very successful by the students. Is it as bad as it sounds, so life-affirming, or is it just a rumor? Can anyone give me advice on what to do in her class?",

The numbers dwindle throughout the higher level classes (those taking the intro class for common core credits, minors, or changing majors). Of course, not everyone attends the lectures if they feel that they can manage learning the material on their own. 127 doesn't have recitation sections like some of the other classes in the major, instead there are homework assignments, weekly quizzes, and biweekly code reviews that you complete in the lab with TAs. The same lab is also used for tutoring that's optional/available daily (all via appointments, because of the size of the cohort). All the best!",

So their slides are low effort with a bunch of information that you would benefit the most by reading a textbook on the subject instead of deciphering what they wrote. \n\nGo on mit opencourseware and you will see good teachers on computer science stuff.",

            "comment": "Reviews on sites like RMP skew towards the extremes - students that coasted through may give overwhelmingly positive reviews that fail to address the prof's or course's flaws, and vice versa with those that struggled to pass. In Hunter and CS, you will have to get used to there only being one option for professors for most classes, aside from e-permitting, or trying your luck with summer sessions.\n\nI took another CS course with that professor (I'm making my best guess based on your posts), and myself and others did well in it by attending the lectures, doing the projects, self studying etc. Their office hours were actually helpful, and there were tutors available too. They are nicer than most of the reviews let on. Lectures are only one small part of the work you will be doing, so the quality of the teaching does not have to make or break your college experience. And tbh, it's Hunter, gotta manage our expectations when it comes to choice of profs.\n\nI empathize with the worry of going into an introduction class seeing mostly bad reviews on RMP, but my advice would be to pay attention in the lectures, make use of their office hours and tutors, and you'll be fine. Make some friends from the class if it would help you to review the material with a group.\n\nGood luck!",

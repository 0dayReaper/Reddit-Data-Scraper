    "postText": "I had a question about the english composition requirement. I took english 120 this fall semester and on degree work it shows that i have to take another english class, so i assume that i have to take english 220. However i see that there is another class called African lit diaspora and that class will allow me to fulfill not only the english composition but also pluralism and diversity A and B. Do you guys think its a good idea to take that course instead?",

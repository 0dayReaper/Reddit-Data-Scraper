    "postText": "Hey so I graduated 2 years ago from hunter college with a bachelor degree in accounting, but I believe I made a mistake during my college years by just focusing on my grades and having a great GPA and never did any internships during my college years. Now I have been struggling trying to find a good job with a big firm, have applied to many jobs but never get the position I also have 1 year or experience working to get taxes done etc. I just need help as to what I should do i this point I\u2019m having a bad time finding a job and a company that will allow me to grow and excel to the next level along with them. Any suggestions or positive critique?",

Hunter College\u2019s accounting program doesn\u2019t carry as much weight as let\u2019s say, Baruch or Brooklyn. Your best shot would be to work at a smaller firm for a few years to gain experience or try to obtain your CPA license. Best of luck.",

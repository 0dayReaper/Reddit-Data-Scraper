    "postText": "I'm looking to take anatomy 1 next semester and am trying to keep a positive view on it despite the negative reviews I keep hearing about this school's science department. It also sucks because they really do offer good classes and major options-I want to be a PA and if I wanted to transfer anywhere they have biology majors that require physics, or orgo 2, or calculus, which I don't need for PA, so Hunter seems like the easiest option for me but I get scared hearing all the terrible reviews. Are there any doable anatomy professors here?",

            "comment": "I think science classes at Hunter are generally just extremely hard because I've compared the same course with people who are taking at other CUNY's and they definitely have it far more easier. Regarding the lecture portion, I think it's doable to do well for the lecture exams. However, the lab portion will be tougher--during the pandemic, when I took it online, we had to do 50 questions in 22 minutes and it wasn't MC but all written responses, so it was definitely a lot of work. Like the other person commented, there's only 1 lecturer so the class size is pretty big, and then you have to pick a lab section. Usually, you don't know who the lab TA is until close to the semester start day, but I had Randy for A&amp;P1 and he was really good. So, I think your overall anatomy grade will be heavily influenced by who you get as a lab TA since some are really strict with spelling and stuff and are not the best teachers.",

            "comment": "I completely agree with everything that others said. There is only one lecture professor, she was an old lady named Maria Figueiredo-Pereira. The class was only taught in the fall and it had about 640 or 650 students, but many students withdraw throughout the semester because of the difficulty. The lecture and lecture exams were online, 60 questions 60 minutes. I had the lab when it was hybrid (fall 2021), the beginning half of the semester was online and the second half was fully in-person. BUT, how you do in this class really depends on your lab TA. I had Kelvin and he was super chill and funny, he even gave subtle hints and can be lenient. I am not a fan of this class because the lab is pure memorization of hundreds of things for one lab exam. And as one already said, the exam is not multiple choice (multiple choice is only in the lecture exams). For the lab exam, you are given an empty sheet and you just have to recall what you know as you answer the questions. The class requires a lot of self-discipline and commitment to studying.",

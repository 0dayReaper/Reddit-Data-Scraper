    "postText": "I had a question. I\u2019m an incoming student at hunter. They offered summer courses which I applied but it costs about $1,000 for only one class. The term for the fall is about $3000 tuition. That\u2019s 5 classes which does not sounds good when calculating the cost. Now my question is, should i take CLEP exams instead of this one course?",

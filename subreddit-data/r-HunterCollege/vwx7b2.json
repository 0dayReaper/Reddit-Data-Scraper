It\u2019ll fulfill the requirement of the section of U.S. Experience in its Diversity that\u2019s apart of the 5 different sections of the Flexible Common Core - World Cultures and Global Issues, Creative Expression, Individual and Society, Scientific World, and U.S. Experience in its Diversity. \n\nFrom your schedule, your math (MATH 12550), English (ENGL 120), and chemistry (CHEM 102) fulfills the General Common core requirements. History (HIST 151 - fulfilling the section mentioned before) and sociology (SOC 101 - fulfilling the Individual and Society section of the Flexible Common Core) fulfills the Flexible Common Core. I hope this is helpful!",

And then the math department called me to say that I already fulfilled the math requirements in high school so there was no reason I should be taking any math classes in the first place. Haven't even started at Hunter yet but this system is so fucking disorganized.",

    "postText": "I will start college on August 25th.  I'm a first-year student, and I set up my schedule. I'm thinking about computer science, and I only have one computer class a week. For now, my other four classes are unrelated (math English, etc.).  I'm thinking of buying an iPad Pro because it's for notes and other similar things, and I have the Asus Zephyrus Duo 15 right now and yeah it\u2019s little bit heavy.  Do you think it makes sense to buy an iPad? After all, I only have one class for the first year.  Or do I need to get a Mac? But I\u2019m planning to buy a MacBook Pro for the second year.",

Personally I have a MacBook Pro and I\u2019ve survived but I wish I got the iPad Pro instead. The MacBook is great for zoom though. What\u2019s your major? I can help you completing the CUNY common core if you need it cause you can take one class and kill two/three birds with one stone (two/three cores with one class)",

            "comment": "I currently own both a macbook pro and a iPad pro and both has its pros and cons. For me, it definitely depends on the class. For some classes, it's easier to take notes using the apple pencil annotating on the profs ppt. For the laptop, it's good for those eng or history classes cus you can type everything. I do have a keyboard for my iPad but it's just different for me. Keep in mind there are also sites you can't open on the iPad including some pdfs from cunyfirst because it doesn't allow that pop-up. If you do get an iPad I 100% recommend getting goodnotes 5, notability is alright (the only plus I would give notability is its ability to record lectures while you annotate notes), and notion (free).",

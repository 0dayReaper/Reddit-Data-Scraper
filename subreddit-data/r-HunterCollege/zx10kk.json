On the real, look for better profs next semester when you retake or for future classes if possible. Read their ratemyprofessor reviews or those teacher evaluation reports. Attend tutoring/office hours, make group chats. Good luck.",

I'm sure it's along the lines of selecting course/prof. You can if the prof gives majority A's or not to know if they are easy graders xD. I think that's about it, and i think you may be able to see comments if people leave any (?)",

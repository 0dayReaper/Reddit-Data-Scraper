Check your classes to see if you have any classes on a different building. If you're taking science class that have a lab, they will most likely be at the Brookdale campus. I didn't know this and I was late during the first week since I had to travel half an hour from the main campus to Brookdale campus lol",

It may take more than one follow up email/meeting with various people to work things out which can be frustrating, but ultimately being polite to whoever's helping you out goes a long way.\n\nGenerally I've found department advisors more helpful than general academic advisors, but you should still plan to meet your academic advisor once a semester, especially since you're building your class schedule on your own from your first sem (freshmen get their first schedule made for them), so I like to run my schedule by my advisor before the term starts just in case.",

Go fuck yourself!\u201d Prepare a list of very specific questions because it\u2019ll be a miracle when you talk to someone and god knows when it\u2019ll happen again. Also make sure your Degreeworks lists all your exemptions and substitutions.",

    "postText": "I have asthma, and usually I carry an inhaler, but today I forgot to bring it with me to school, and so of course today is the one day where I get an asthma attack. I stepped out of class to look for a nurse\u2019s office, but apparently there is not one single nurse\u2019s office in the whole school, and EMS had to be called for me (in my opinion, my condition is not that serious). What happens if a student were to get injured in the gym or something?",

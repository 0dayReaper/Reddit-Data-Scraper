    "postText": "So basically the score for the class was out of 1000 and on blackboard it was over 1000 while I got a 943 which equals to an A based on the syllabus. She ended up giving me a B but calculated the wrong grade. I emailed her letting her know what happen and she said to email her in January to change it.   \n\nIdk if anybody had this problem and how was it resolved?",

Took about a week or two and my grade was updated. As long as you have it written it was a mistake(email works) it should be fine.",

I wouldn't blame the professor either, they are given like 3days after the final to submit everyone's grades. In that time crunch situation some mistakes will pop up.",

The points system is fairly foolproof (I use it) but a couple of things can go wrong if entries aren\u2019t correct and running total is used to calculate letter grade. But they could just have added it wrong to Cf. Grade changes get signed off by dept, so I recommend emailing again before 28th, and don\u2019t be afraid to follow up and get confirmation. Timeframe varies but about a week.",

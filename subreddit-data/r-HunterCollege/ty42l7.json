    "postText": "Hey guys! So I\u2019m aiming for a career in the medical field, either a PA or physician, and I\u2019m currently deciding between Hunter, Brooklyn, and Stony and I got into the biology major for all 3. Stony hasn\u2019t given me good aid so I\u2019m going to appeal. However, Hunter and Brooklyn is pretty good financially. \n\nIn your honest opinion,if you were in my shoes, would you choose Hunter or Brooklyn? Whichever one, could you explain why (programs, school atmosphere, resources, etc.) \n\nThank you so much!",

I feel like anyone who tells you to go to hunter pre health wants you to fail. I have seen the YouTube famous Dr. gray take a crap on hunter\u2026 if that doesn\u2019t scare you then I don\u2019t know what will. Go to Brooklyn or stony.\n\nJust the thoughts of a third year dental student who graduated from hunter.",

That being said don\u2019t you think theres plenty of merit for that in graduate school? From what I\u2019ve learned, medical and graduate schools only continue to challenge a person. Part of that challenge that is present at Hunter, is getting help finding solutions. I\u2019ve personally never met any professor who plainly refused to help a student. All of my professors without exception had allocated time and space for additional supplemental session. Besides, there\u2019s literally a whole floor of the library dedicated to offering even more help. Maybe it was after you graduated, but a platform called navigate is conveniently available for every student to set up academic advising appointments. Sure, you can say that there are requirements for students to get 1on1 advising from the pre-health office, but there are plenty of group advising meeting and drop in meetings available. The pre health office is trying genuinely so hard to be able to accommodate every student. So I think the resources are there, but there aren\u2019t served to you on a plate. This is coming from a rising Senior at Hunter.",

                            "comment": "I\u2019m a third year dental student at the moment and took 2 gap years so my experience is definitely could be considered outdated, but I can tell you why I think hunter was a terrible decision for any prehealth major. \n\n1) Hunter doesn\u2019t have a lot of spots for their science classes. Overtallies typically do not apply for science courses, especially ones with lab. I couldn\u2019t get in orgo for a whole year before I just decided to permit out to Brooklyn college. It wasn\u2019t just orgo, I was held back by a whole year because I couldn\u2019t get into a few of their required science courses for bio majors. Again, overtallies aren\u2019t a thing. \n\n2) The prehealth committee had ridiculous requirements for letters of recommendations. When I went, it was 5 letters by professors and another 7 evaluations and a GPA above like a 3.6 or something. That\u2019s nuts. This may only apply to dental schools but almost all dental schools require a committee letter, so if I didn\u2019t feel like getting 5, Then my options would\u2019ve been reduced by like 80%. Even if medical schools aren\u2019t like that, I can\u2019t imagine the premeds are happy about 5 letters and 7 evals. \n\n3) Hunter science classes are unfairly challenging in terms of course content and work load. I epermited so many classes only to find that the second portion that I take at hunter was so much harder. It was unreal. In Brooklyn college, I had like 2-3 anatomy tests. Then I went to hunter for anatomy 2 and we had 8 tests and 4 quizzes.  \n\n4) I also don\u2019t think being on your own is great for doctoral or graduate school. In doctoral school, all your classes are picked and everything is done for you in terms of support. All you need to do is study and do well. Yes you need to keep track of when your work is due, but all the things like classes picked and stuff are done. You never have to see an academic advisor and what not. Professors are way more interactive, and sends you all a ton of emails, they remind you of the tests, boards, stuff and when you take it and everything. You get mentors without asking, and everything, and they also encourage group work etc, because in the real world you need to work with people and colleagues. Being all on your own at hunter was literally the opposite of this because no one had any direction unless they were the top 1% of students. While dental school is 2-3x harder than Hunter, we can still all agree that we have a clear goal and people to guide us. Hunter, nah. Doctoral school tests you on how competent you are at your job, which is health and procedure/surgery stuff, not how good you are at finding what to do next in life. That is completely unnecessary.",

            "comment": "I think everyone has their own thoughts about Hunter. As a senior who's graduating at the end of this semester who also pursued pre-med, I can safely say that I am very happy to be rid of this school and I actually do not care at all about attending the commencement ceremony because of how much I've grown to dislike a lot of aspects about the Prehealth office in the recent year. It's true that there are people who enter Hunter for medicine and succeed as PA's, doctors, you name it, but for the majority of the population, a passion for medicine is not necessarily all you need to thrive in Hunter's prehealth atmosphere. \n\nThere are people out there who have a lot of other responsibilities on their plate, whether it be juggling numerous jobs to make ends meet or taking care of their family members, and for those people, meeting all of the requirements of the Prehealth office can be pretty tough. Upon not being able to meet the requirements, the advisors can be extremely discouraging about your choice to pursue medicine. Because of this, the difficulty of the science courses, the lack of proper teaching for most of these science courses, combined with the toxicity and competitiveness of the Prehealth students can really affect a person's mental health even if they don't have anything else to worry about except studying. \n\nWith all that being said, I've actually just committed to a nursing program in the upcoming fall even though I have sat for my MCAT exam and was adamant about being a doctor, mainly because as I've grown and reflected on my years at Hunter, it's caused me to realize the competitiveness and toxicity will most likely continue long after I graduate, so there's really no point in stressing over whether or not I can become a doctor at this point in time. If it's something I still want to do in the future, I'll reconsider, but for now I'm leaning towards becoming a nurse practitioner just because for all the effort I've put in in my years at Hunter, I've realized I prefer to have breathing room for other things that I like even if I do still want to help patients. \n\nAll in all, if you do attend Hunter and you come across students from other CUNY's or even other schools in general, it is likely that you will realize those schools are far easier in terms of science classes and people will likely be able to earn great grades at those schools with minimal effort. A lot of people may say Hunter is good for the sciences, but if you don't think you're someone who can handle teaching a lot of the material to yourself and spending a lot of hours studying and not always getting the results you want, I would recommend going to a different school. The prehealth environment here definitely discourages people from pursuing medicine, thus most likely eliminating many who could have made great physicians in the long run. But, regardless of what choice you make, good luck!",

            "comment": "Honestly, despite all the negative stuff that is being said about Hunter's pre health department and science curriculum, I don't think I would've not chosen Hunter. It's hard af, you'll encounter a lot of roadblocks, but honestly, these are filters that check whether you are cut out for the process. I realize this might sound a little elitist, but unless you are truly and deeply motivated to succeed, and I'm not just saying to succeed as a doctor but to succeed as a person, then don't do it.  Also if stony is not giving you money then fuck them, no school is worth getting into debt, especially if the loans are unsubsidized.",

It\u2019s also a fallacy. People are successful at Hunter because they\u2019re pretty well off but yeah you do get some underdogs. I think the potential to go to med school is there but cant say the same for lots of other schools. It\u2019s also up to the student to do everything in the end.",

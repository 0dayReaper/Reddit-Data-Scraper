    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm currently an incoming freshman at Hunter. I was wondering if anyone could advise me on what classes to take my first year to graduate within 4 years and maintain a 4.0? I'm entirely set on attending med school and don't know how to set up my schedule. I'd like to major in either psychology or biology, right now I have biology down. I'd like to take some of my easier classes first so I can have a better gpa to set me up for future years. I'd really appreciate any help y'all could provide. Thanks! :)",

Youll be given block schedules to choose from based off learning community.\nAlso hunter intro sciences are weed out classes so you should be mentally prepared.\nIf you want to look ahead though, google hunter college degreemaps 2019 and select your major to see what courses youll need.",

But first sem sci class would\nBe chem 102. \nFreshmens dont have majors. What you out on application would not matter when you come until you officially declare it.",

            "comment": "Major in psych if you want a higher GPA. Bio majors benefit from having a lot of pre-reqs count for their major requirements, but theres usually a slight cost to their GPA bc of how hard the classes are. I\u2019m majoring in psych myself and the classes have been a breeze. There\u2019s many easy A classes you can take in the winter and summer as well, and you\u2019ll also have a guaranteed opportunity to TA for a course later on if you get an A- in psych 248. Overall the psych dept is pretty supportive as well. \n\nAlso don\u2019t take all your easiest classes first. In the event you don\u2019t have such a great semester, it\u2019s better for this to happen early so you can still show improvement later on. Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t do well in sophomore year, those easy classes will give you some breathing room bc you can still demonstrate an upward trend in your junior and senior years. Having a bad semester or two is no big deal as long as you show upward trend, but a downward trend can potentially be a red flag. But also don\u2019t take all your hard classes all at once either, try to keep things balanced. \n\nHope this helps, feel free to pm me if you need any advice",

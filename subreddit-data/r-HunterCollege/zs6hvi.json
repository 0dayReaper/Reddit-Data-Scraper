Being way too isolated really goes against living an overall good life. Genuine human interaction is essential for everyone.

I was so excited. By the second of three semesters, no one in the class would talk to me. I wasn't invited to any celebratory drinks or study groups. However, the rest of them didn't pass on time. I think if you're doing well in your classes and on track to graduate, that's worth the social sacrifice. You have the rest of your life to make friends. And it already sounds like you're ahead of most in the self awareness department. That's a very attractive quality to the right people. I'm rooting for you, fellow pariah.",

I think it is important to be around people. Humans are social creatures, no matter how introverted we are. We need someone we can lean on during our dark days, and i don't think sacrificing that friendly shoulder in the name of grades is a good thing. Essentially, you can be sacrificing your mental support system, especially if OP is feeling lonely.  Also, OP and many others are very capable of holding relationships and grades up to pass on time. It takes some practice but you need to find the balance because once you find it, you will appreciate both your academic and social life. Most friends that you have will understand that you need to study or something. Real friends want to see you succeed and understand your priorities! Its mostly about OP being able to set that boundary with any future friends. And if OP is lucky, they can find friends within the same classes to help each other. And about having the rest of your life to make friends, it gets a tiny bit harder to make friends as after college usually people end up focusing on careers more, but ofc there is always a good chance that it does happen! Even after college, we will still be social creatures!  I just feel like OP *deserves* to give friendships a chance while *in* college too. We need social connection. Many times social connection and support is the only reason why we stay strong mentally to handle life\u2019s pressures. I feel like by setting out the idea of \"social sacrifice\" it is like telling OP to settle with what they have instead of trying to gain a happy friendship that can very much still be possible. Although I agree with the idea of keeping your grades at highest priority by avoiding unnecessary distraction, I must say that friends can make your life so much better, as long as there are boundaries set that your friends understand! I don't want OP to think being lonely during college is an achievement just because the social people in the program you mentioned didn't pass on time. Maybe they are happy with all the relationships they gained and are completely okay with not passing on time and still would not change anything. \n\nTo each their own. OP is feeling lonely and *wants* friends.\n\nAs for advice for OP, just be yourself. I cannot emphasize this enough. Do not try to fit a mold. The most that can happen if someone doesn't like the true you is that they will stop talking to you. Slight chance they will make rumors about you. So what? Seriously. SO WHAT?? Them making rumors says more about their characters than yours. That means you talk to someone who will appreciate you. Do not ruin your chances of finding a friend bc of a pessimistic reddit answer. Be a nice person. You attract what you give out. I was lonely for yearsss starting from 9th grade in high school, but the moment that I started unapologetically being myself 3 years ago (senior rn) and made kindness my priority, i attracted a lot of great people. I have like 3 great friends and thats all i need. They like that I always make them feel comfortable and that i would do little things to make them happy and the wild shit i say sometimes (before i would not say these things bc i was too shy and had social anxiety, so this is what i mean by unapologetically being yourself). Initiate a hangout. This was hard for me, because you can possibly be rejected but after a few weeks of talking with someone, go watch a movie together that you both would love. The first initiation started a lot of friendships for me. Some friends stick around and some don't. That is completely fine and nobody's fault. People change. You can offer to hangout again and a true friend would be interested, but its ok if you guys sorta drift apart. You just keep being you. I have drifted apart from plenty at hunter and now looking back, it is just how life goes and i have no hate or regret. Some of the people i drifted apart from were more harmful for me than i originally thought, and i realize that now years later.\n\nWord of Caution: Do not try to be friends with anybody and everybody. Just because you are lonely, that does not mean you put down your standards and self-worth. I do not want you to invest your energy into someone who after 2 weeks of talking, seems like an asshole (they might have asshole behavior in a disguised way such as gossiping about others, backstabbing, etc., even though these might not look like outwardly assholey at first. Trust your gut. How someone is treating their other friend is likely how they would treat you later on. Learned that the hard way. Plenty of people like that I have encountered at Hunter.) Stay away from toxic drama. Handle issues like an adult instead of  resorting to high school esque drama. I, personally, cannot stand people that laugh while casually making fun of their friends behind their backs. Immediate turnoff. Distancing myself from that person. That behavior is a breach of trust. I do not want that energy around me. If you encounter someone like that, run lol. You can start small talk with a bunch of people, but feel out their character and morals. You have a right to walk away from people who do not benefit your life. You have control over your life.\n\nI wrote an essay sheesh. \n\nNo hate to the person I am replying too. I just wanted to put an optimistic perspective out there for the sake of OP, along with some advice.\n\nGood luck! Getting comfortable with people will be a journey but start now! We are here for you! Let us know how everything turns out during the spring semester :) and take up other peoples offers to play games (potentially even over this break \ud83d\udc40??). I only play minecraft and fall guys which are games for babies LOL so i don't think that would be sufficient.\n\nYou got this!",

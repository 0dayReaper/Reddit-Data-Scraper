    "postText": "does anyone know how i could go about withdrawing from classes or taking a leave of absence. i\u2019ve been considering it since last semester but i never fully went through with, and it\u2019s only the beginning of the semester so i thought this was would be a better time than doing it down the line. mental health hasn\u2019t been good at all and school is heavily contributing to it. \n\nalso by any chance would it be possible to take 4 classes instead of 5, and still be considered full time and down the line taking winter/summer class to make up those credits. would it affect my financial aid. this is all going based off me still continuing college rather than dropping out.",

You just need 12 credits counting towards your degree for tap and fafsa. 15 is recommended to finish in 4 years. You can make them up in summer/winter but you will need to check if financial aid will cover the cost or not.",

            "comment": "I did not study film at Hunter, but my advice to you is don\u2019t do it.  I earned my BA in Film &amp; Video in 2010 from Columbia College Chicago which is a far better film school than Hunter, and I would not advise anyone to go to film school unless you are entering a very prestigious program.  You can learn everything you need to know to become a professional filmmaker on your own.  You could start working on film sets as soon as next week if you meet the right people.\n\nThe only reason you should go to film school is for the networking opportunities.  Hunter is not going to be able to provide that for you.\n\nNot to mention this is a tough industry.  Think long and hard before you decide to get into this field.  The job market is extremely competitive and it\u2019s normal for a lot of positions to work 60-80 hour weeks regularly.  You gotta love the work deeply and be willing to sacrifice other things in your life.\n\nAfter 12 years in the industry I decided it wasn\u2019t for me anymore, and now I\u2019m studying psychology here at Hunter.",

            "comment": "I was a former Film major at Hunter about 5 years ago, I found it extremely difficult to register for certain classes. Film 201 in particular, which is a core class, only had one section open per semester with about 30 spots and they did not accept any extra students. It\u2019s a relatively small program that had too many students enrolled. There were many non-film majors who chose to take film classes as \u201ceasy\u201d fillers, which obviously made it harder for film majors to enroll in those classes",

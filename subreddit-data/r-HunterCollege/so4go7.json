    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m applying to the MSW for spring 2023 and wanna know what my chances are of getting in. I graduated from a state school with a PoliSci degree and a 3.45 gpa. My GRE scores were 169 verbal, 143 math. I did a few internships and cool social work-related extracurriculars in college. I was in americorps for a year after I graduated, but for the past three years, I have been drifting, doing random jobs for a few months at a time. I just started a masters of library science program at queens and realized immediately it wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll finish the semester with strong grades, but I\u2019m not even sure I should put it on my application.",

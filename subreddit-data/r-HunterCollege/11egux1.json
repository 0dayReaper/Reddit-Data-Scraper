    "postText": "I'm a senior in hs going to college (nursing major) in the fall. i submitted my application back in december but still haven't received a response. For a while my application on the cuny website was labeled as incomplete even though i submitted everything. I emailed my school college counselor several times to send my transcript, but yesterday i spoke to her and she said Cuny should pull my hs transcript the moment they get my osis id. Later that day i went to hunter and spoke to the guy at the admissions center and he said they received my transcript 4 days ago feb 23, two whole months after i submitted my app. ... does this mean my application was submitted late or only the transcript was late? Will this affect my admission? Is it too late for me to be accepted? im really worried cause this was one of my top schools and i still havent committed to a school yet. It feels like everything is falling apart and going wrong especially with college stuff. Im not a exceptional student or anything, just average, but i really want to go into nursing. Please help!",

            "comment": "Take a deep breath. I believe what admissions told you is just your transcript being late, your application would've been on time. Because your transcript was only just received it may take a while to hear back. If iirc the last day to commit is May 1st so as long as you have backups to commit by then you'll be just fine. If anything you can always try transferring to Hunter after a sem elsewhere.",

Once you are in hunter, then you will be able to declare your major depending on if declaring your major needs prerequisite to be able to declare it. Since you mention you want to do nursing, you would have to take all the required prerequisite courses and the NCLEX exam so you apply can apply to the nursing program to declare your major as nursing",

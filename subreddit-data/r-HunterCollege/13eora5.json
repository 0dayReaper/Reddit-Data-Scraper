    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am currently a Bachelor\u2019s student of CS in Tecnologico de Monterrey, located in Mexico, which is the #2 best Mexican university, top #170 globally and top #86 for cs globally. It recently came to mind transferring or just applying to certain Hunter College, since I have always wanted to live in New York and I think studying in the US is a major advantage for getting a job there. \n\nMy question is, which one do you think would be a better choice? I would really like a job at FAANG, and I know that many of the cs students at my current university have had internships at FAANG and also have jobs in this companies. But I also think that studying in the US is a major advantage for getting a job there (is it not?), since I think these companies would prefer people studying in the US at a not prestigious college rather than a somewhat prestigious college in another country, which is why I was thinking of applying and going study there.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best choice for me? \n\nI should mention that my gpa isn\u2019t that good, which is why I didn\u2019t think of applying to some university more prestigious than Hunter College, and that I am about to finish my first semester here.",

He's taught himself Python, created a game on roblox that was a pretty big deal at the time, etc. So it looks like computer science is on the radar (plus he hates writing papers)  \n\n\nWe live in Manhattan and he'd get the Excelsior free tuition... if he went to Hunter, Baruch or City College he'd never need to take out a loan. (His sister also went to Hunter and graduated loan free).  \n\n\nHe likes Stonybrook and Binghamton, but the question is, is experiencing dorm life worth the cost? (He is the first to admit it could be tough since he has ADHD).  \n\n\nI also wonder if Hunter's computer science classes are keeping up with AI etc.",

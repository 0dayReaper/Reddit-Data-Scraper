Freshmen have a specific month for the Romance language replacement exam which is in June. As of now, there\u2019re only 2 dates which are Monday, July 18 from 10 AM - 12 PM and remotely on Monday, July 25 from 11 AM to 1 PM. Seats might or might not be full already. Sign up for the placement exam @ www.hunter.cuny.edu/rlplacement. I hope this helps!",

If you're good at french, taking 4 semesters of language will only boost your gpa. Getting exempt from language will cause you to take up a \"minor\" (not an official one either) which is a whole load of more work on yourself. They make you do this so you have an adequate amount of credits from the institution to graduate.",

If you take placement and get exempt you can do a concentrated study (which is what kino meant by not official) or an actual minor. \nPersonally i would rec starting language during sophomore year so youll finish by junior so you have one less requirement needed during senior year.",

It is a 4-semester class if you decide to start from scratch. If you want to graduate on time, I suggest you also start around junior year or if you want to get it all out of the way, take it as soon as possible.",

So if you take Spanish 101 you can\u2019t switch to another lang like Chin 102 it will have to be Span 102. The language classes aren\u2019t difficult, so after your first sem when you\u2019re able to make your own classes you should start it so it\u2019ll be done before you start taking your major classes.",

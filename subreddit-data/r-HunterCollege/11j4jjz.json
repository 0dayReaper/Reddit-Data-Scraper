    "postText": "I was selected as an eligible applicant and the program seems interesting, but the information form is rather vague about the kind of research I'm supposed to do. I emailed the guy listed at the bottom of the form and the only info I got was that it should be related to my field of study, which is helpful I suppose but doesn't tell me exactly what I'm supposed to do.\n\nSo I figured I'd ask here. Does anyone know if there are specific guidelines to the research? Is it a paper with a word and/or page count? Or is it some project? Something else?",

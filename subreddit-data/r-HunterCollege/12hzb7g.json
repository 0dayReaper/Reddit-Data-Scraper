    "postText": "Hey everyone, so I just found out there was a mistake for myself in the school system and long story short I need one more psychology elective in order to graduate with a psych degree. I need a 3 credit psychology elective at either a 200, 300, or 400 level. I wanted to take a course in the summer since I REALLY wanna graduate already. Does anyone have any recommendations for easier classes I can take that meets those requirements?\nThank you",

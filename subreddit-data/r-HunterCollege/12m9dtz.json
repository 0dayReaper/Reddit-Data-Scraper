I believe this email is asking you to apply to Hunter through SEEK but you need to put in your financial info in order to figure out if you qualify to be part of SEEK. If you do get accepted through SEEK, youre still a Hunter student but you get many other advances like a personal advisor for 4 years, 10 semesters of financial aid rather than 8, and they give you extra money for books, commuting, tuition per semester on top financial aid.",

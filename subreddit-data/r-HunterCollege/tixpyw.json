I know that these programs offer a lot of benefits and most of the people on the \"successful premed profiles\" on Hunter's website are a part of either of these programs. Unfortunately, I was rejected by both but I got into hunter. So how disadvantaged am I as a general freshman, compared to those in the specialized programs? Please feel free to include any success stories cause my mom is currently telling me to go to Stony brook instead even though it would be way more expensive than Hunter. I don't qualify for financial aid and my parents aren't paying for college either so I would have to take out loans.",

            "comment": "Hunters pre health dept is severely understaffed and the advisors have been burnt out for years. There are only 2 advisors for thousands of pre-health students (not just premed). \n\nThe percentage of premed students who matriculate into med school has been gradually increasing (currently 97%). This stat is intentionally deceiving. The reason it\u2019s this high is because they only work with very high stat applicants by endorsing their app with a committee letter - but the requirements for this letter are ridiculously difficult to achieve. This also serves the added purpose of decreasing their overwhelming workload. There are also numerous other hoops to jump through which I can go on an on about. I can also go on and on about the poor quality and notorious difficulty of the stem pre-req classes you will need to take. \n\nIn general, students receive very little support, as it is also nearly impossible to schedule an appointment with an pre-health advisor. Students do not have the option of scheduling an appointment unless they are considered a pre-health student, so you will need to camp out for drop in advising. The slots for these fill up nearly immediately, and they are very poor at replying to emails. You\u2019ll pretty much be on your own. Our school has been named and shamed several times on r/premed and there is so much more to be said about the poor quality of this program.\n\nFeel free to dm if you want more info and the links to experiences from other Hunter students, both pre meds and current med students. There are many successful med students who went to Hunter. However, much of this success should not be attributed to Hunters pre health program, and was largely achieved despite having no choice but to work with this program. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to go to stony brook, take it. You may need loans, but I think you\u2019ll have a much better time there, have more support from their pre health department, and end up in a better position when it\u2019s time to apply to med school. \n\nTLDR: Avoid Hunter if you wanna be a doctor. Go to Stony Brook.",

You'll even see people often taking a dump on it in r/premed.\nGoing to Hunter for premed will only make your life harder. Medical schools rarely care about undergraduate and all other aspects of your application will far outweigh it in the admission process.",

And my parents are dead set on not paying for college and I definitely won't get a penny in financial aid. No scholarships either. So is it wise to go around 100k in debt for undergrad? Is Hunter really that bad? And im going to be majoring in bio so its not really lucrative if I want to pay back those loans :(",

A lot of them have pre med programs that don\u2019t have unreasonable requirements like Hunter does. I\u2019m checking different CUNY websites and honestly I would\u2019ve been better off picking literally any other school. Go to one of these to save money, but just avoid Hunter",

Science professors are much better at Baruch and the size of the classes is ideal to actually learn. Hunter's weed-out classes like Bio 100 start with hundreds of students and many fail. There's zero support from the professors, Sheppard hasn't had office hours in 2 years.",

Every science class is hard as hell because it\u2019s so competitive and your grades end up taking a hit because of it. I took bio at CSI and the difference in difficulty between schools was crazy. Med schools don\u2019t care what CUNY you went to, they care how high your gpa is. Also the requirements for a committee letter are insane, I suggest you look at it and the comments people made about it on r/premed. The science classes are also huge because there\u2019s so many premeds, so good luck getting a letter of recommendation from one professor when they\u2019re getting asked by 500 other students. I suggest going to any other cuny.",

            "comment": "Grain of salt. This will get downvoted by most people because they are misinformed.  I'm attending Hunter this fall, transferring as junior pre-med. I'm not changing because Manhattan College did offer me a scholarship, but they rejected 1/3 of my 77 credits because they didn't offer Genetics, personal finance, and others.\n\n\"Tough\" schools are only because people don't use what is given to them. If you need someone to guide you the whole way, then a private school is best. As I've read, many people talk down about the academic advisors at Hunter, but they never set appointments to see them, which makes it harder on them setting up the correct curriculum, getting set for graduation, and such. I'm half sure it's the same for the course work and talking with the teachers, reaching out for tutors, and so on.\n\nThere is a lot of hub bub about how to become a doctor. There are tons of focus on several factors, but the reality is that it really depends on which med school you want to go to. Examples, High MCAT scores matter only to schools ranked high by the US News or some such. Research only matters if the medical school does a fair amount of research for funding. Extracellular matters if they have a well-known sport team. Shadowing and volunteer matter for proving you are dedicated.\n\nThere are ways around it, like holding only 1 job the whole time through college, attend a medical school that's mid to low ranked. etc. Do your best to appear professional, keep above a 3.2 gpa. Only apply to medical schools that line up with what you have done or where you could count as \"diversification\" and you'll be fine.",

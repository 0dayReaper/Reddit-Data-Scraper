    "postText": "The learning advisors/learning communities that hunter makes for first year students/first semester students are ABSOLUTE RIP OFFS. \n\nThey literally made me take engl 220 without telling me that this one wouldn't be writing intensive when i could have fulfilled both course requirements easily. then they put me in a psych class i didn't even fucking need. they also didnt put me in chem 100 but put me in chem 101 which made me a semester late for my prereqs for the nursing program. this fucking sucks, i dont know why hunter has these unqualified \"professionals\" help with class selection, why do they have students as helpers/advisors for cunyfirst class searching?\n\ni cant wait to leave hunter already bruh. this is absolute hell. only thing keeping me going is the professors themself.",

I had a learning advisor assigned to me that I met with once to go over what I planned to major in and that I know what classes to take, etc but I literally had to do all the work to make appointment with him, etc. Never had anything from him reaching out or following up. Literally only met that one time (because it was required) and that was it.\n\nI will note that if you are in Macaulay Honors they seem to be more proactive, but that's a very small % of overall students.",

Either way when i enrolled first semester i followed this ish http://catalog.hunter.cuny.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=43&amp;poid=10419 . For the future noone will be helping you enroll in classes. I had to figure things out on my own basically all 4 years. Also piece of advice from experience. Unless your gpa is above 3.8 have a backup plan of what major you will go in if you dont get into the nursing program",

Similar experience with the Hunter French department as I had in high school, where because fewer students tend to feed into it than other programs, it seems, you get more personalized attention with the smaller class sizes.  My favorite professor was Oliver Sage as they were so kind and accommodating and really knew what they were doing when it came to teaching a language.  In general the classes are going to be like all language classes where it's about your dedication to learning the language and professors who notice how much you care will give you similar effort back.",

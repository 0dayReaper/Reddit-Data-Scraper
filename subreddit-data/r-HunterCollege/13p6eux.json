Are both calculus classes required or do we have to take them?\n\nThinking of either Baruch\u2019s Computer Information Systems major or Hunter\u2019s computer science major, anyone have a preference?",

            "comment": "Really depends on what you want to do in the future. If you want to be Software engineer in the future, I would not recommend Baruch's CIS degree. It's more for those who want to pursue IT/Cybersecurity/Data analytics. From what I see on that major track, it's part of the Zicklin school, so it's not that mathematically rigorous and focuses more managerial/business classes. It's very broad in terms of its classes.  \nIt does not teach the important fundamentals you will need to be a Software engineer (data structs &amp; algos, discrete struc, comp arch) Of course, you can self-teach yourself those things but you might as well just do a full CS program instead.\n\nSo, if you want to become IT/Cybersecurity go CIS. If you want to be an actually SWE, go for a CS degree (it can literally be anywhere, just make sure it's a CS degree from an accredited university)\n\nAs for you Calc 1/Calc 2, they're gonna be online and they're both required for CS majors. Whether they're easy or not depends on you study habits. I usually just watch Professor Leonard.",

            "comment": "Cs at hunter is prob considered pretty difficult compared to other schools. And we only get a BA. I think even though calc and calc 2 are pretty tough classes, it might be the least of your worries since the other cs requirements are pretty difficult. \n\nMost professors are okay. It definitely could be better but imo this major requires a lot of self learning and time put into studying and understanding the topics. I took the same Calc professor for both classes. Other people didn\u2019t like him but I found that his grading style/teaching style worked the best for me. This is only specific to me, since I find math enjoyable but I found the rest of the cs curriculum to be much more difficult than anticipated. If u ever do take calc, I\u2019m open to sharing my notes for the math classes, feel free to DM me. \n\nHowever, imo hunter has pretty good opportunities. If u do take it, I highly recommend you sign up for the cs newletter. There\u2019s constant emails about diff offers for nyc and some are applicable to Cuny students only",

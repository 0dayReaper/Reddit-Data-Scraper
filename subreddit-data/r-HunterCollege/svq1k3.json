I think the best way to get response for anything is to give as much clear info as possible, like your EMPLID, put questions in a bullet point and add screenshots if it\u2019s about a hold or something on your account. Good luck.\n\nhttps://hunter.cuny.edu/students/financial-aid/office-of-financial-aid/",

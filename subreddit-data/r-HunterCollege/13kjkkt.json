The hard part is the exam. As long as you understand the concepts and know how to apply it, you are good.

The admissions committee of dental schools don\u2019t even know what ePermit is, just explain that the count system is an amalgamation of different public universities in New York City and say that the system allowed you to take classes at other campuses without restrictions, and you picked the classes that worked for your schedule or that hunter didn\u2019t have enough space. \n\nI don\u2019t even recall sending in another transcript because the ePermit courses showed on my hunter transcript. Obviously don\u2019t have like 7 different colleges to be safe but if you stay with the same 1-2 ePermit colleges, it should be fine. I literally ePermit like 10 classes from Brooklyn college.",

The biology classes are trash, I  don't know if you can do biology at another CUNY, but the upper courses you should be able to, like microbiology, genetics, anatomy, etc, it just probably won't count towards your major (don't know about this part). Of course things have changed in the last 5 years so ask them, or better yet just try.",

    "postText": " Hi All - I wanted to see if anyone might be interested in a job involving pick-up of my daughter who will be attending school in the Upper West Side near the 96th street express stop. In total it'll be about an hour to an hour and a half or so each day inclusive of travel starting at either 2:30pm (Tue, Wed and Fri) or 4:00pm (Mon and Thurs). We are a family based in 15 William Street in the Financial District and would be happy to be competitive in terms of pay. Thanks so much!",

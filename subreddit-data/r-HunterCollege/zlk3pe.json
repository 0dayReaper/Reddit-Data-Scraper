    "postText": "I'm currently trying to transfer to Hunter College (majoring in Art History and Italian), but I'm worried that an F grade will affect my chances. My first semester I received 3 B's, an A and a C. The next semester I received straight A's. I haven't gotten my grades for this semester yet, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to receive 3 A's, one B, and an F (in math). I think my GPA will be about a 3.4. I've gotten all A's for classes related to my majors. I have a letter of recommendation from Art History professor, a club and two job for my extracurriculars, and I'm working on the optional essay. How likely is it that I'll be accepted despite the F?",

They weren\u2019t related to my major (Studio Art) so I believe that helped. I didn\u2019t do any extracurricular activities nor the optional essay and got accepted to CCNY &amp; Brooklyn College as well before committing to Hunter. I spent a solid 3 semesters at my previous school before I transferred to Hunter and my GPA ended up being a 2.7 so I honestly believe you\u2019ll have a better chance.",

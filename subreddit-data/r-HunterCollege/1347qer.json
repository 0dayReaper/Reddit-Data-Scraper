I\u2019ve been in the same program for 2 years now and am expected to graduate next year so I may be able to answer some of your questions. 1. Most of the school counseling classes are held in the main building by Lexington and some classes are all the way by 94st at the campus school but there are some classes that you need to take in the beginning of the program that are still being offered online. Also, summer classes are still being offered online it seems. 2. I live in Brooklyn, so I just commute to school. 3. I know the school has dorms away from Hunter but I don\u2019t know a lot about how the dorms are set up for students. \nFeel free to reach out if you have anymore questions :)",

But if you can, also try to take some summer classes so that by the time you do your practicum and internship, you don\u2019t have to take that many classes, I think that\u2019s more manageable. I would also suggest working as much as you can now since by the time internship comes you may not have enough time to work as many hours since for internship you need to go in for at least 3 days a week to complete the 300 hours needed each semester of internship and for classes you may also have to go in 3 days a week depending on how many classes you take and what days they\u2019re scheduled.",

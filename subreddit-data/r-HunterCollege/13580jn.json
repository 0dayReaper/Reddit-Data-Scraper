I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s certain students who would often do research at a different school during the summer, and if that\u2019s the case, was it easy to find? Do we receive help in other to find these types of opportunities, or do we have to do it alone?",

You can apply to those or independently look for your own. As a psychology major, research opportunities are always available both on the listserv and also if you build close relationships with the professors, many do their own research and choose hunter students to help. I personally had a professor who would tell us of opportunities that her colleagues had at different colleges around nyc.",

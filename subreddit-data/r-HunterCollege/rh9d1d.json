    "postText": "Hi all! \n\nI applied to the MSW program at Silberman last year for the COP&amp;D track and had to defer due to personal reasons. I am in the process of reapplying through deferral which would automatically admit me to COP&amp;D. However, this past year I was able to organize and produce theatrical events which opened the floor to discussions regarding community mental health, and now am not sure if I should apply to clinical practice (essentially, restarting the application process all over with the chance of not being accepted).   \n\n\nI'm looking to combine applied theatre, master of social work education, and mental health research to improve community and individual health and mental health outcomes. Any advice on what track is better suited for this is much appreciated. \n\nHappy to clarify and discuss as well (currently, in an anxiety spiral brought on by all of this) so I understand if it seems a bit scattered. \n\nThanks! xx",

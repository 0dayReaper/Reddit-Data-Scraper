Any advice on how I can get one before classes start on Wednesday? If I can't get one, how can I enter the buildings to attend class? Thanks for the help. \n\nThank you.",

Not sure how they're doing it tho. \n\nIf you need to go to the building and don't have your ID yet, you can just get a visitors pass for now?",

Go up to them and ask for your id. If its not available by Wednesday, make sure you bring a form of identity whether it's your passport or driver license with you so they can make you a temporary id and have your student id number written down incase they ask for it. They'll ask you to take a pic with their computer and then they'll print our ur student id and the pic on a sticker paper. Show it to the securities at each building and they will swipe you in. That's what you would do if you were to ever lose your id or left it at home.",

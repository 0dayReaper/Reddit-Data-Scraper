    "postText": "Hi guys im planning to transfer to Hunter this coming fall as an out-of-state student. I was offered financial aid but I'm still going to have to pay roughly 18,000$ for two years. I just got off a zoom meeting with a financial aid advisor at Hunter that said I'm getting the maximum amount of financial aid and therefore I cannot appeal. I'm not trying to discredit the person i spoke to, but am i ACTUALLY out of luck or is it still possible to appeal my financial aid? has anyone experienced this and had luck getting more aid?",

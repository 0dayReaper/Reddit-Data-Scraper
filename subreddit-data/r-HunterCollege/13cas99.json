    "postText": "I have 108/120 credits and am missing my entire language requirement due to many sections being in the middle of my workweek throughout my time at Hunter.\n\n1. I have two years of French from high school. Do exemptions only apply if I have 4 years?\n2. If I self-report my high school transcript, do they confirm with my school? I can't bear to waste a half semester dealing with a language when I am practically done and never had the opportunity to take the courses without losing critical income.\n3. I have a placement exam scheduled but I am worried if I don't place into the last semester then I cannot apply my minor credits to fulfill the focus requirement.\n\nHow can I bypass this requirement so I can graduate in fall and not pay out of pocket for a part time semester???",

    "postText": "I'm currently taking Media 180 for my Hunter Core requirement and I like the class so far. I'm not a great writer or speaker but I do feel like I can give \\*satisfactory\\* input to pass the class and similar ones. Are there any other classes in the Media department (that are not too writing-heavy) that you would recommend for a concentrated study? If the writing can't be minimized, then which would be the most fun to have in a concentrated study?\n\nAlso pls feel free to recommend other areas of concentrated study that you think are fun/relatively chill!",

New Literacy (MEDIA 211) is also awesome. It's the class that got me into journalism, Professor David Alm is excellent.",

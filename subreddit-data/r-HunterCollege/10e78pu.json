    "postText": "Hi, all. I have already registered for classes at Hunter College for the Spring 2023 semester. My only remaining task is to acquire a OneCard, which I am having difficulties doing. As to why, I currently do not have a valid state ID or passport that can be used to prove my identity; the latter expired six years ago. I already made an appointment to get an expedited passport at my local Post Office this Saturday, and I should have it in 3 to 5 weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, what should I do? Should I request that my professors provide a live stream of our in-person classes? Can I use my CCNY Student ID card to obtain day passes at the Visitor's Center Services? Is there a way to sneak into the West Building?\n\nI will greatly appreciate any advice you may send about.",

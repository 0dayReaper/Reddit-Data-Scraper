The course work is a lot, especially for a 100 lvl course. Also, try to make friends in that course, that way you can help each other with the assignments.",

If you\u2019re a freshman you should probably look into the other kinds of professors with college now attributes and such. \n\nIts going to be an uphill battle for sure, theres weekly quizzes, biweekly coding reviews (oral reviews you need to explain), program assignments daily pretty much, oh and final exam that will FAIL YOUR ASS IF YOU DON\u2019T PASS IT LMAO.\n\nBest of luck, I\u2019m attending the section on Tuesday. Why theres only 10 sections for computer science is beyond me. \n\nBest of luck!",

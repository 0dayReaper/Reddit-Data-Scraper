Eventually, dragged my grade to C. Do I need to retake it in order to get my major courses?",

The last day to enroll is 1/3 (according to academic calender [https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/academic-calendar/(https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/academic-calendar/)](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/academic-calendar/(https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/academic-calendar/)) . \n\nI think taking in the winter is a great option, it helps you catch up. It's only 3 weeks, and media 180 wasn't bad for a 3 week course, it was doable and easy A. :)",

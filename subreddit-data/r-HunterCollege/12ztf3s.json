When we do test review she literally looks at the test and tells you exactly what\u2019s going to be on it, so make sure you sit in the front row. 3 tests, one final. we\u2019ve had one quiz. The syllabus says there\u2019s a presentation but we haven\u2019t done that. HW is easy. If you come to class and actually study the language you\u2019ll be fine. And French and Spanish are both Romance languages so there\u2019s that.",

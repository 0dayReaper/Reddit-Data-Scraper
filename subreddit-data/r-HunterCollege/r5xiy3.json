    "postText": "Any help is really appreciated. I\u2019m a transfer with my AA - I was supposed to begin in the fall and was enrolled for fall \u201821 but was not able to (personal circumstances). I\u2019m trying to enroll for the spring but I am only able to search for Classes in the spring, my CunyFirst will not allow me to add anything to my cart. I had advisement back in the summer originally, I know what classes to take, but getting into contact with anyone has been a hassle. \n\nThe navigate app and website won\u2019t allow me to make an appointment. I\u2019ve emailed my advisor, the advising department and the navigate app and have had no response. Tried calling the registrar\u2019s office and no answer either. \n\nI\u2019ve never had so much trouble just trying to get in contact with one person from hunger just to direct me the right way. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d apologies if this is a self explanatory issue I\u2019m missing.",

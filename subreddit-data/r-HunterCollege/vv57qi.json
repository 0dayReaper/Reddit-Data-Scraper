    "postText": "So, I took the math placement test and I was placed for Math 101. However, I finished the Level 2 workshop and completed it. The problem is that Math 101 has been designed as a requirement by an advisor, so if I add Calculus 1, I'll be taking two math courses in the fall instead of one. So is it possible to swap out Math 101 for Calculus 1? I also need Calculus 1 since I am majoring in Computer Science and I'm an incoming freshman.",

If you take the MPT and scored enough points for a Level 1 or Level 2, you\u2019ll be placed into those course(s) and be removed from Math 101. I\u2019m not sure about the workshop, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re like the MPT but rather than an exam, it\u2019s a workshop to give you the skills or whatnot. So if you completed it, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll remove you from Math 101 and place you into a Level 2 course, which is Calculus 1 and one Level 1 course. I would suggest reaching out to the advising department. I hope this is helpful!",

Just head into schedule builder in CunyFirst and give it a go.",

Just make sure that at the end of it that it shows enrolled on the Calculus 1 class and Math 101 in the shopping cart. Cause the class will probably still show up on your schedule but it\u2019s in the shopping cart you won\u2019t have to take that class",

But avoid math 101 if you can and go straight to one of the pre-reqs. I think they\u2019re all level 1. You completed the workshop so all you have to do is fill out the Appeal form and say that you completed the workshop. From there you should have permission to take one of those pre-req classes this semester.  (at least that\u2019s what the site says). \n\nHope this kinda helps",

Hunter College is extremely crowded, very weird layout that absolutely does not make good use of all the space that the buildings take up, there are some lounges but they are extremely tiny, and no cafeteria? Only place I found to get food was that little empanada thing outside the library. John Jay was much more spacious, better lit, cleaner, everything was better maintained, just way more professional overall.",

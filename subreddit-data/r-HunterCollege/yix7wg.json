Participation, reading assignments, and classwork questions were 30%, Original fairy tale assignment was 20%, Written/Oral Presentation was 20% and the Final was 30%.  The one thing I dislike was that we didn\u2019t really know our grades since she didn\u2019t post on blackboard and would just communicate through emails but towards the end she gave us an estimate on what our grade was.",

She was really nice and an easy grader. You mainly do the fairytale question, participate in class because I realized that she would mark if you participated. And as for participation, it was just you talking about the answers to the questions and your opinion. I do know that it\u2019s a hard class to get into because it gets full real quick so if you\u2019re thinking about taking it, act quick!",

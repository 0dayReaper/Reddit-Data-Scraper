The amount given to scholar programs seems to change every year but it's never more than Macaulay. I get free housing for the first year and then $1750 for four years as a scholar. Macaulay (at least in the past) is 100% tuition free so. Easy choice. \n\nBut, if you're already getting free or serious finaid, go with daedalus. It's a much more specialized program and you have a better chance at meeting like minded peers. But it's seriously nothing special for how big the financial difference is.\n\nI wish I'd gone with Macaulay lol",

If you were on the list to receive a Daedalus offer, you will receive an email at some point offering you the opportunity to be in the Daedalus classes and be a de facto  member, and if you were not on the list to receive a Daedalus offer, you won't - the two programs figure out their offers independently but since Macaulay offers more money and if you were on the list to get a Daedalus offer you'll get the more money but still get to take part in the Daedalus community",

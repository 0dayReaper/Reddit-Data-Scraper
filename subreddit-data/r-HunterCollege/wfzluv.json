    "postText": "Hello! Just wondering if either of the second year courses for Public Health are actually in person or asynchronous. I remember someone telling me that either the Community Health Assessment or the Fieldwork Practicum course is not in person; I assume the latter but want to confirm. Both taught by Cardenas. Has anyone taken either of these? \n\nThanks!",

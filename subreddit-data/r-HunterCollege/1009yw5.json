    "postText": " I heard that Baruch is offering a CS+ major starting in August of 2023. Since this program is new, I'm assuming that the department will not run so smoothly. On the other hand, Hunter has an established CS major program - and even an honors program for CS majors.\n\nWhich CS program would overall be better? Daedalus at Hunter or a regular CS major at Baruch? How are the classes in each school? How are the departments in each school?\n\nAny and all comments are appreciated.\n\n(I have posted this on r/HunterCollege and r/Baruch.)",

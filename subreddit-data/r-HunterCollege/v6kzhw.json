            "comment": "I took her class this past semester. If you're gonna go based on lectures alone, you're gonna struggle for sure. She has a really bad accent, and the lectures are hard to keep up with because people are always talking and it's not always clear what she's trying to say.\n\nBut everything is set up to help you pass. There is always tutoring, just like there is with 127. Even though they may not always know the answer, they're always willing to figure it out with you. The recitations are also a great way to help you stay afloat, as there are professors who are just sitting there waiting for questions. For the really hard assignments, like the projects, she also provides very clear guidelines to get you started. You almost always just copy paste and then switch out variables.\n\nAs long as you aren't afraid to go to tutoring and spend some time in the lab working it out with TA's, you'll be more than fine",

Are there multiple recitation times.\n\nAnd what do you mean everyone just talks? She just keeps on teaching even through everyone talking? No stoping or anything?",

Just look at all the materials she provides online and submit all your work. I had her for CS135 and I slacked off a little towards the second half and managed I to get a B in the class after studying for the final a lot.",

He won't change companies, always saying that at his age, it'll be worse if he goes somewhere else (being the newbie), plus he's just comfortable where he is despite the bad conditions. I don't know where those ideas come from that it will be worse if he changes companies (Actually, I do know, his mentor told him, which my dad listens to like he's God. So we hate his mentor.), but I've learned it's not my place to say something anymore, as it leads to arguments. I think I meant I don't understand how any of his excuses of not changing companies make sense. It's ... quite depressing, knowing he's not doing well. I wish you and your dad luck tho, hope your dad can change his job, if it's convenient/possible for him.",

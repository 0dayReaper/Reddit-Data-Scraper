    "postText": "I am a non-CUNY transfer student set to start in Spring'23. I am still learning my way around the system (so if you guys have any tips please let me know!). After receiving an email with the login information for my Admitted Student Portal, I have been knocking out the onboarding tasks listed. One of them is to book a Group Advising Session on Navigate; however, when I log in and click \"Schedule an Appointment\" &gt; \"Academic Advising\", I am not able to see an option that says \"Group Advising Session\" or anything of the sort. I only see advising options for specific majors. Am I doing this correctly? \n\nAlso, I need to attend a group advising session before being appointed an Academic Advisor.",

She reached out to her colleagues in charge of the transfer process and explained that I must attend a Group Advising/Orientation Session to be assigned an academic advisor. She also pointed out that I did not have anyone assigned to me yet. Fortunately, she was able to get her colleague to register me for the Group Advising because I was not able to find the link in the Admitted Student Portal.",

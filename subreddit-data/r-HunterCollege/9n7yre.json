    "postText": "I saw a post on a Hunter group a week ago about their being bed bugs in the Hunter library in the 6th floor? Is this a common occurrence at the college?\n\nI've been hearing about these incidents in my classes or when i'm walking by in the halls or elevators lately. Seems the bed bugs are on the sky-bridges too? Does the administration do anything about this? If this is true, it's serious, and they need to deal with it with heat treatment and pesticides ASAP.\n\nNow I know places I won't be sitting at or going to going forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink: [https://www.facebook.com/cunyconfessions/?\\_\\_tn\\_\\_=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARB\\_y3qaC17wrDQo8RMMt\\_TEJ-8GXQKe\\_DSlfS05wJJI43skhTLGW9D0JRG0BAH7zdt4sKAiOWdLjitg](https://www.facebook.com/cunyconfessions/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARB_y3qaC17wrDQo8RMMt_TEJ-8GXQKe_DSlfS05wJJI43skhTLGW9D0JRG0BAH7zdt4sKAiOWdLjitg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Confession #112 from Hunter College\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo anyone know how to deal with bedbugs in the lecture halls specifically the West 4th floor one? I sat there for one lecture and my arms are raw and red right after , idk if I should go to the school about it or just go to my parents about it. I'm thinking a lawsuit.....\n\nSeptember 21 at 2:09 PM \u00b7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConfession #111 from Hunter College\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLol this place got rats and bedbugs in the library\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"\n\nIf this is serious, they need to do something about this immediately. This isn't something to play with, especially in a commuter school where people that don't have bed bugs are being exposed to it.",

I never thought that I would be going to a school that has a bed bug problem and that the administration would do nothing about it! I'm literally afraid now of bringing those critters home, because they multiply fast.\n\nI don't think they'll do anything unless we provide them with evidence and that means being exposed to those things while on campus. Should it happen again, please take video and pictures. I cannot believe that they wouldn't do anything about this. This school or certain parts of it needs to be shutdown immediately because this is a public safety / health issue.\n\nI just went over the CUNY Website and they provide ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in regards to reporting this type of thing. 311 won't take reports on CUNY bed bug problems.",

This is a matter of people's mental health now because whoever gets them won't be able to sleep, and will be terrified of those critters.\n\nI'm thinking of making a public facebook page where people can post these things.\n\nIn 2016, Brooklyn College students took videos of what was happening at their campus regarding their own bed bugs infestation and they got the news involved, which worked in their favor because it became public knowledge.\n\nI don't understand why this cannot be reported directly to 311. This is an issue that affects NYC/NY residents that commute to this school. This cannot just stay like this. Let's take action before those things spread throughout the whole school, which at the rate people are saying, they're everywhere, even in the west and north buildings. ",

            "comment": "The cheapest option is gonna be Brookdale (3K a semester). Your aid will probably stretch the furthest in Brookdale as it\u2019s cheap and is run by Hunter directly. Though I\u2019m not sure how long Brookdale will be in service cuz of their push to demolish it. Brookdale does have its issues with being an older facility in NYC, but the staff seem to be more on it to fix an issue. Also it\u2019s generally easier to navigate around there being an issue with the bathroom or kitchen as you could just go to the floor below yours. Word of advice if you end up choosing Brookdale is to try to get placed in the east building .\n\nSecond up is 51st (6.5K a semester) which I would avoid like the black plague. Aid is a bit more finicky cuz of the higher price tag and the dorm being being managed by a 3rd party. On top of being twice as expensive as Brookdale, the dorm was very rushed to completion and it shows in the crummy paint jobs, plumbing issues, and so on. There\u2019s only one kitchen for the entire dorm on the 1st floor which gets really crowded and really messy because of the sheer amount of people passing through. \n\nLastly is 79st (15k-19k a year). I haven\u2019t lived in there but it seems to be alright aside from the fact that it\u2019s essentially a glorified apartment that you have to share with 3-7 other people.",

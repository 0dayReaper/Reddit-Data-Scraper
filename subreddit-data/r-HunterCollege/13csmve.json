    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nThe production team of ***Time Biter*** are hosting a post-show Q&amp;A and talkback with students on **Thursday, May 11th**. The producers on this show have produced several independent plays and musicals in New York City, Los Angeles, and Vermont. Playwright, producer, and star Caroline Dunaway will be part of the discussion to share her experience helming a project through three different runs. We encourage any students interested in theatre or the theatre business to attend. \n\n***Time Biter*** is running at the Players Theatre at 115 MacDougal St. until May 21st. Showtime on Thursday will be at **7 pm.** The show runs about an hour so the talkback will begin a little after 8 pm. You must have a ticket to attend and you can use our student discount code: **TBSTUDENT30** for a 30% ticket discount. \n\nWebsite: [https://www.timebiter.com](https://www.timebiter.com)\n\nABOUT THE SHOW:\n\n***Time Biter*** is an original sci-fi dark comedy that has been described by audiences as \"*30 Rock* meets *Black Mirror*.\" ***Time Biter*** begins in the year 2067, on the 75th birthday of award-winning movie star Stella Howard. An unexpected birthday gift from her granddaughter - a new time-travel simulator - throws Stella back to a time in her life she hoped never to revisit: the year 2019. As Stella struggles to adjust to the life of a twenty-something nobody in New York City, she comes to realize that the particular day she\u2019s been forced to revisit may be the day her life changed forever. This hilarious and moving new play follows Stella as she confronts the ghosts of her past and reckons with the person she\u2019s become.",

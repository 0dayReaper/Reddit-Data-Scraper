Imagine the amount of stress in knowing how to answer 400-700 questions from the given question bank in addition to remembering hundreds of names and functions of muscles, bones, and etc all just for a 25 question test that is only short response. \n\nYour question depends on the situation. If you want to take them but you are not in the program yet, then you can epermit BIOL 120/122. But once you are in the program and you didnt take those classes yet, you are not allowed to epermit them and must take them at Hunter.",

I did decent on the lab exams (these are hard since it's purely memorization) but honestly not a lot of people are talking about the lecture exam which was pretty hard too. But since it's online, often people can just look at their notes but some still fail it because it's a 60 question exam you have to finish within 60 minutes. \n\nOne of the main factor on doing well on this class is to probably try to get a really good lab TA. Some lab TA are very lenient in terms of grading and can give you partial/full credit on your exam answers whereas some lab TAs are ASS and would give you zero credit on your exam answer.\n\nClass average for lab exams usually ranges from 40s-60s. There are 8 exams in this class in total. 4 lecture exam and 4 lab exams. \n\nIt's honestly too much work. If you any questions or discord feel free to DM me them, ecriss#5555",

Nice ratings gave me iffy professors and bad ratings gave me strong and nice professors. I had to ask for personal experiences and those matched how I felt about my professors, so I\u2019m looking for personal experiences with professors rather than looking at reviews on RMP because it\u2019s not clear if it\u2019s done by the professor themselves or the students, you know?",

Memorization is not my strongest ability; however, I\u2019ll try. 60 questions in 60 minutes is doable as it\u2019s 1 minute per question. I heard that lab exams were 50 questions in 20 minutes - that\u2019s NOT doable for me at least thinking right now. \n\nAre there curves since the average is so low? Who would you recommend for TAs? Would they be teaching the same semester again? I\u2019ll send you a request on discord as well, but these questions are open for anyone to answer.",

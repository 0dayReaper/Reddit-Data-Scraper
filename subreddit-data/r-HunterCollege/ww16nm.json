I can't find it on Amazon or anywhere else T.T. I literally have no idea what to do and I dont want to create a bad impression on the first day itself. Does anyone know where i can find it?",

It says its required on the hunter bookstore, class starts and u never touch the book even once. Don't spend any money on any textbook until classes actually start and u have confirmation from the professor themselves they are actually using the textbook. \n\nIf anything u can always ask the professor if u can use a older version and get the pdf online",

They will always list some textbooks on hunter bookstore as \"required\" but some profs don't require anything and sometimes even provide it. Wait till you see the profs syllabus before deciding if you actually have to make a purchase because most textbooks can be found on library.",

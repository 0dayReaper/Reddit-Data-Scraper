    "postText": "hello hello! i am taking chem 120 org chem with prof green. the first exam was a week ago and COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than the practice exam we were provided (which was the summer exam she gave to her online students last semester). a lot of people said the same of the test being hard and different than the materials we were provided.\n\ni know prof green is a great professor. she really does a great job. but how can i get an a+ in this class? what tips do you guys have for those that took the course and did good? i go to office hours and tutoring at skirball. recitation also really helps for me personally, but what else can i do? thanks for reading:))",

            "comment": "Sadly, that is the reality of that class. The previous professors were extremely harsh on their students. Prof Hamann, who is currently teaching Organic chem 1: CHEM 22204, was the one who originally taught the course. Based on RateMyProfessor, he was a sadist who makes his students suffer and I was glad that I did not have him. I had Prof Ramdular, who taught spring 2021, and she was also harsh, but at least not as bad as Hamann. Seeing that you have prof green means that you are in good hands.\n\nThe tests will always be more challenging than the class material and the stuff in the lecture. The only way to get an A+? It was all thanks to the curves. But, continue to go to her office hours and tutoring. I also recommend [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA). He was the best!",

Do you know if the lecture and recitation count as 3 credits each or 3 credits together? I would really appreciate your help!",

Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHEM 121 is a completely different course but uses material from CHEM 120. For CHEM 120, all you need is the lecture section and recitation.\n\nRecitation isn't a credit but makes up part of your grade.",

            "comment": "hey! i transferred in last semester. i pretty much had to figure out what classes i needed on my own because i heard nothing from a general advisor (still don\u2019t have one) and my major advisor was unresponsive. thankfully i switched my major and the advisor is extremely helpful. i didn\u2019t meet with her until a couple of weeks after i registered. if you\u2019ve declared a major i think you\u2019d have better luck reaching out to your major advisor but ofc it wouldn\u2019t hurt to make use of the virtual front desk. if you ever need any help or questions as a transfer, feel free to message me! i\u2019d be more than glad to help",

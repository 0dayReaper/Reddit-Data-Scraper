    "postText": "ok so this is how i study for anatomy and physiology, i would love to hear from you guys and see if this is effective, if you have any suggestions, that would be nice to hear as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso i have two notebooks for the class, one notebook i use to specifically jot down what the professor says during lecture and lab. the second notebook is where i stay ahead of the professor, i go through the slides and make sure to jot everything down, sometimes i simplify the slide so i can understand it better/memorize it since it is smaller phrases.\n\nthen on a piece of computer paper, i make sure to combine my regular notes on the slides and the professor's additional comments onto a paper, and use that to study. i do the samething for lab.\n\nbut on my first lecture exam i got a 71 and a 84 for the lab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni am very scared of not doing well and want to improve, any advice is appreciated/any specific study technique is appreciated.",

For 2, I got an A and used Anki and YouTube resources to help me understand physiology. Lab is easy points, try to hit high 80 low 90s in lab. Unfortunately lecture is a crapshoot but if you get 3-4 points extra credit and get low 80s on the lecture and high 80s on the lab you could get a B+ or even an A-.",

You don\u2019t have to use up the whole 3 hours but at least stay a bit and spend some time actually memorizing, take pics of all the things then just grind it. You should aim for 90+ on the labs, because it\u2019s the easiest portion of the class. \n\nThe lecture part, there will be concepts that you may not understand. Watch YouTube videos to supplement your understanding then use flash card apps like quizlet or anki. Look for quiz let\u2019s that your upperclassmen have made and grind those.",

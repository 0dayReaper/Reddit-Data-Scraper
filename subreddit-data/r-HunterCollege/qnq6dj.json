I am a social psych concentration major and i need two psych 300 classes in the social psych track in order to graduate. i am just worried what if the classes i need is full because my options are limited. Do you guys know if the 300 classes fill up quickly, because I am worried when I have such limited options. These classes have 1 section only available with a capacity of 30\\~ students.",

I have super bad anxiety (lol) and hunter is one of my top choices and so far I\u2019ve gotten into Albany, NYU, and stony brook . I just want to make a good financial decision i guess. If anyone would be able to let me know how long they took for them to make a decision? \n\nAnything honestly would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\udc96",

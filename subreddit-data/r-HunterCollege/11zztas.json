I kinda need to take a summer class to fulfill my 30 credit requirement for Excelsior but issue is that the single class I\u2019m taking already is charging me $1000+, money I don\u2019t have to blow on a single class. Is there any sort of scholarship designated for summer classes only? Both in and out of the CUNY system?",

Random question again because I was looking through the eligibility requirements, it says I need to take a class that counts towards my degree, does this mean I can take any class as part of my degree (such as classes that cover general education requirements) or only ones as part of my major? \n\nI know it sounds like a stupid question but I\u2019m overthinking it so I want to be sure lol \n\nThat and I don\u2019t need to submit anything else outside of the scholarship form when it\u2019s available yes?",

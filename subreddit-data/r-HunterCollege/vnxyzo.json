    "postText": "Hi guys, \n\nI was wondering if I should use my old ipad from like 2018 with great storage (256 gigabytes) or lend a laptop from the school. What kind of technology is best for a new college student? Also, does anybody know the success of students who pursued a political science major in a nursing focused school like Hunter?",

When I was at Hunter, I would do my readings on an ipad, and then use a loaner laptop for papers.\n\nI was a polisci major (I just graduated) and I am going to be starting a fully funded polisci PhD in the fall. We had a Rhodes Scholar in my cohort too. Hunter\u2019s political science program is really excellent. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a rising sophomore and I found that I preferred using my Samsung Galaxy tablet for taking notes in MOST classes. There were some classes that I felt more comfortable using a PC laptop as, at least on my Samsung tablet, things like research websites, CUNYFirst, and Blackboard would not load in properly all the time. That said, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to borrow a laptop if you can. The worst thing that happens is you end up not needing it and use the iPad, but if you don\u2019t borrow one then you might get stuck on an assignment if it can\u2019t load up on the iPad. \n\nAs for the environment of the school, I\u2019m doing an interdisciplinary major that is focusing on writing and social equality and so far I personally haven\u2019t felt like I\u2019m at an academic disadvantage. I\u2019ve really only been taking intro classes to fulfil my general education requirements and prerequisite classes so far, but that means I\u2019ve dabbled in a bunch of departments. While, I have met a lot of people that are pre-health/pre-nursing/pre-med type students, I\u2019ve also found a lot of psych majors (which I believe actually make up the largest percentage of undergraduate majors at this school) and some other people interested in other disciplines. I haven\u2019t even felt like the school focuses on any one major as most of my interaction has been with individual professors in their respective individual departments. Each department is somewhat in its own bubble that works hard to provide for students taking classes in that discipline. So, unless you plan on surrounding yourself with nursing students or plan to take a lot of pre-health classes, I think you\u2019ll find yourself pleasantly surprised that the school does cater to other disciplines and I don\u2019t think your success will be hindered by the fact that Hunter has a popular nursing programme.",

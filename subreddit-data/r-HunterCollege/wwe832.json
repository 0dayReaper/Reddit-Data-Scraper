You will likely be able to form study groups through classes, but those acquaintances tend not to last beyond each semester. As everyone would tell you, join some clubs, finding an activity you enjoy doing and meeting people through that would let you interact with those outside of your classes. \n\nAs for credits, I have a bunch of elective credits, sometimes you have to go to department advisors with the course syllabus for them to accept the credit as an equivalent to the class offered at Hunter.",

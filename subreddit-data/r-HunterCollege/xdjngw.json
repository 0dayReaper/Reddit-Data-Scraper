    "postText": "I want get into this college so bad because what the titles state above. I have a friend who wants me to join Brooklyn College to join him or Kingsborough to join his previous professors. My goal is become a psychologist as a major but have writing and philosophy on the side because I want publish a book one day \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. So, I want to be accepted since I want be able to make my own story, legacy and so forth. Is there anything I can do to be accepted and feel like my story can be written in a more greater passion. I\u2019m currently 23 years old, took a year break to work \u201cthis past year\u201d and worked on my G.E.D. to get my high school diploma in \u201c2018-2021. Any advice or anything like that will be appreciated since I want be able to be apart of the spring semester and beyond.",

If you're aiming for the bachelor's anyways, I feel it's not necessary to do an associates, then transfer to get the bachelor's. It's like, if this is the destination anyways, why make a stop somewhere else.\n\nBut if you're thinking to work &amp; do school... Be mentally prepared &amp; you'll live. If you don't do as well in school, okay try the associates first. If you're average in school, just go straight for the bachelor's.",

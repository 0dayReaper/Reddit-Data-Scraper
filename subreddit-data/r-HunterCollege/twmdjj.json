    "postText": "I am taking my last course to graduate in the summer and have applied for summer graduation. My summer class ends 7/27. How long does it take for my transcript to reflect that I have completed my degree? Or is there any way to get another way get proof that I graduated. I start a job 8/15 and need to show proof of graduation before that.",

The registrar's office might be able to provide a letter confirming that degree requirements have been met after the grades are submitted. Suggest you reach out to the registrar in early July to ask what arrangements can be made.",

Also, use Transfer What If in Degree Works and/or [Transfer Explorer](https://explorer.cuny.edu/) to see exactly how your credits will transfer to a new CUNY college, and also consider carefully the requirements of the new college and how your existing credits will satisfy those requirements. Transferring to one college versus another could result in your taking one or more semesters extra time to graduate.",

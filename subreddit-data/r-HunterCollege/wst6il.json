    "postText": "Ok so originally I was enrolled to take Math 150 Calc with Hiro Komatsubara this semester, and I was fine with that given the fact that I was just looking for a math 150 lecture that lined up with my schedule. That was until I decided to randomly look up his rating. See this is only my second semester in college, period, so I never really thought of looking up teacher reviews. That is until I saw a TikTok, of all things, where someone mentioned you could look up teacher ratings online, and it reminded me of how the profs were asking people to fill out the evaluations at the end of the semester. But back to what I was saying, I looked him up on RMP, and based on the reviews this guy is a handful. The complete opposite of the teacher I would like to have. I read that he  makes digs at students, making you feel stupid if you ask a question he deems unworthy of a response from him. \n\nJust all of it had me kind of panicking. Like I had a dose of what Hunter College Maths Department was like last semester, when it was basically self taught material that the professor just reviewed. But my professor at the time was very helpful, and with the fact that it was asynchronous, I managed.\n \nBut this Math 150 lecture is in person. So I checked on the class builder section of CUNY First and found out that there was another lecture at the same time with a different teacher, one with a WAY better rating. So I guess my inquiry was: if you are someone that took Math 150 or took  a math class with Komatsubara, do you think it\u2019s worth just staying in the class or should I just see if I can still get a spot in the other class?\n\nPs: the other lecture is taught by Geoffrey Akers\n\nMAJOR UPDATE: \nI was able to swap them!!!",

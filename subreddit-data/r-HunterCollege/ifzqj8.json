But during lecture there would literally be tons of people just not paying attention, sleeping in class, etc. I felt like they thought it was going to be an easy class.But no, Econ is different. It\u2019s the nature of the subject.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair bit you can honestly say that about any course\u201d\nI would  say Econ 100 sort of isn\u2019t like any other course. You can pass some intro courses with just memorization because of the nature of the topic, some courses you can\u2019t, you need to memorize ideas, UNDERSTAND them and know how to apply them. For example you can pass media 18000 (intro to media studies) with just pure memorization and regurgitation if content.",

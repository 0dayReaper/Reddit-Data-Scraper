Also I try to ask prof what topics or chapters will be exams if not already stated in syllabus to study and not waste time on looking over everything. And I try to recite whatever Ive studied out loud I find that helps w memorization. I also make sure I get homework\u2019s out the way so when I\u2019m studying I can just study and not be drained from doing other school work. Also make a friend who can send u their notes if you miss a day or missed something in ur own notes. Overall I don\u2019t go too crazy on it but don\u2019t wing it either, you don\u2019t want to overload w studying and confuse urself or forget it all.",

So depending how often I have the class I aim for 2 hours at least of looking back at the info on my own on the days I have it. Studying for TOO long is actually more harm than good so whatever time works for u thts what u should do even if it\u2019s just 1 hour.",

If your classes are like that I would suggest always always do those readings and make sure you stay engaged in class and take notes. You\u2019d be surprised how much information you retain just being alert in class and having your professor clarify things.",

I don\u2019t do interval breaks but instead I just take breaks when i feel like im slipping out of the flow state (you should look into this if pomodoro doesn\u2019t work for you). Each break will then last 10-30mins until i am mentally ready to go back to work for another undisrupted 45mins-2 hours.   For writing classes, make sure to proofread thoroughly and make sure you answer all the prompts your prof assigns. I struggle with stem classes but I\u2019ve been skimming my slides before class and jotting notes in my own words as the prof explains each vocab/idea. I\u2019ve gotten all As in my classes except for the hard science classes like gen bio and gen chem which I\u2019ve gotten B and C in lol. But that was during quarantine when I thought I could get away with not active studying",

    "postText": "I was checking if Hunter had any classes in 3d modeling or animation and I found one class for 3d animation that was in the media studies major. Would it be a wise decision follow through with this pathway (media studies/emerging media major) for 3d animation or transfer to another school? I also found that Lehman college has a CGI BS degree so that would be my second choice.",

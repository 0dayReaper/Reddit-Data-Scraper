I took a few classes at my old college that I believe have equivalents in these departments but transferred as electives. Please let me know if your familiar with the process.",

She was like, \"So what did you study in trigonometry?\"\n\nA MATH dept rep asking me what I studied in trig. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab  Gee, lady, let me think -- basketry?\n\nI told her I wouldn't budge from the line until she made at least one of those classes count for my math credits.  A few minutes of a staring contest, and she relented.\n\nIf you can provide a photocopy of the table of contents of your textbook, that is also helpful.\n\nHope you have an easier time than I did!",

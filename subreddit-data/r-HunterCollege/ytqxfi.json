            "comment": "Trust me I had the same debate BA vs BS for Cs and to be honest it doesn\u2019t matter which one you get. What matters most is your skills, how much time you dedicate to learning and getting internships. Internships will be way more helpful than what type of degree you get in the long run. Your degree only gets you to the door \ud83d\udeaa but having internships gets your foot through the door and eventually a job. Also what they say about hunter cs is very true. I had prior cs knowledge already so I was lucky going into my first day. But I remember going to my first college Cs lecture (CSCI 127)with professor Tong Yi and literally the first day she went straight to for loops and I remember the first days on the hunter cs127 discord everyone stressing out and complaining saying that she didn\u2019t even introduce or tell us any of the basics of python, how to install it and that you could barley understand her cause of her accent etc. And I was also thinking to myself like how is she going to throw everyone straight into that. Some people never touched or seen code up till now. She is not one to hold your hand though the process. Also her class you are in the huge lecture hall with more than 100 students so you have to put in the time to self study cause as I said she is not one to hand hold you through the process. Plus for her class it\u2019s a weed out class. So if you fail the final you fail the class. No matter if you got good grades on your weekly quizzes and code reviews and did all your assignments. If you fail that final you fail the course.",

Personally I would not recommend Hunter Cs unless you have the discipline to self-study. Queens I am not sure but you can give it a go. I heard better stuff about Brooklyn's Cs tho, but again its anecdotal.",

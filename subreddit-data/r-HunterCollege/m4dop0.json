I haven\u2019t committed, but it\u2019s my current top choice and I want some insight from current students/recent graduates. I\u2019ll be a bio major and I know that the intro classes are hard af because they\u2019re weed-outs for the pre-med program. As someone who\u2019s NOT going into the medical field and just sticking with bio, what is it like? I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s super cutthroat and you\u2019re left to feel completely on your own (haha\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f). \n\nI\u2019d be dorming at Hunter in Brookdale so if anyone could tell me what it\u2019s like dorming there (hopefully specifically in brookdale) that would be super appreciated! \n\nI know it\u2019s a heavy commuter school and can be kinda cliquey so if anyone has experience as an out of state student and what it\u2019s like socially that would be great!\n\nAlso, what\u2019s food like on campus? I heard they don\u2019t have a meal plan? If that\u2019s true, what do students do for food? I know it\u2019s NYC and there\u2019s food everywhere but still\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80\n\nThanks I\u2019m advance!\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05",

Most people would just go to the library (we have 9 floors) or sit in front of the next class (some call it \"floor culture\") when they have time. \n\nYes, we don't have a meal plan, but there are so many restaurants within a 5/10-minute walk if you don't want to eat the expensive food in the cafeteria. For example, there's a pizzeria, Dunkin, Chipotle, all within 5 minutes and even more if you're willing to travel",

Many people are to themselves and are just there to go to class and leave (hence being a commuter school). If you\u2019re a social person, you\u2019ll def find people to be cool with at hunter. The science classes are def a challenge and will mess u up if you don\u2019t prepare for them. For the most part it\u2019s about balancing your studying and try not to overexert yourself (especially during the day before the exam, use that to rest up and not pull an all nighter, trust me on this\ud83d\ude2d)\n\nthe food at the cafeteria is mid (based on what I\u2019ve heard). There\u2019s a lot of food places around hunter like chipotle, dunkin, etc. honestly there\u2019s too many to list. \n\nCentral Park is a 5 min~ walk and it\u2019s honestly a good spot to go if you\u2019re trying to vibe/study. Times Square is a 20 min~ but you\u2019re in the city and there\u2019s a lot todo in the city \n\nIf u end up going to hunter, make the best out of it! Everybody\u2019s college experience is different; make yours unique!",

They're all lecture-based. It's hard as FUCK. If can devote your time to studying, you'll do good though. I love the location, I feel like it's the perfect spot in the city.",

I transferred here for the spring 2020 semester and I would be all friendly and shit before class started and people initially were like wtf this guy is being friendly but they eventually warmed up. As a native of New York I can't say much on the dorm experience but I know this is the best city on earth and if you wanna make friends and have a fun time with them you definitely can.....keep in mind there is plenty of potential to meet people that don't go to Hunter in NYC. Take the subway down to Washington square where it's always a buzz, you can have a social life anywhere if you seek it I believe !!",

If you are lucky you will get to know 1 or 2 of them and be friends with them for some time. Other than that, there is not a lot of people to talk to if you don't go out of your way to make friends. Honestly since classes went online there has been more student to student interaction than ive ever seen in person. Between whatsapp and discord people are talking way more than before and helping each other. I dont know how things will go after classes return to in person but id really recommend atleast making 1 friend in your major to stick with otherwise you will easily end up on your own which sucks. Good luck",

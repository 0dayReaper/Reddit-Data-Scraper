The class participation is important cause even if you miss one reading, from the discussion you can piece together what it\u2019s about so you don\u2019t fall behind for the next week.",

It saved me so much time going through each syllabus, and it's okay to leave things last minute, but try to do at least 50-60% of the assignment before hand. I once had to do like a 15 page lab report in 6 hours it was torture.",

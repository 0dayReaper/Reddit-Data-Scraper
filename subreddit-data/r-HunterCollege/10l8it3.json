I would pay right now but on CUNYFirst, I\u2019m worried my financial aid isn\u2019t included yet as it still shows my charges to be $1,700 when financial aid should cover $1,500 so I have to go to the Financial Aid office (unless anyone can tell me whether it\u2019s normal/okay for it to say that. It shows my pending financial aid and the \u201ctotal\u201d amount but I don\u2019t want to accidentally pay the full $1,700)",

I\u2019d hate paying the 1.7k in full now tho since I only have 2.6k saved in the bank rn but looks like it might be my only option \ud83d\udc94 I\u2019m hesitant on it cuz I overthink it and fear I might not get the refund at all but if that\u2019s normal then I\u2019ll push through the anxiety lol",

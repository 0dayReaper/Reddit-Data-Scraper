    "postText": "I added german and accounting to my spring sem because i had only 10.5 credits and the excelsior scholarship wouldn\u2019t appear unless i had enough credits. however, i didn\u2019t realize 13.5 credits was enough to be a full time student so i dropped german in the beginning of this sem. but accounting is just not it and i\u2019m planning to drop it soon however, i have no idea how this will affect my scholarship since it has been already processed back in January. does anyone have any idea what to do or how dropping this class will affect my financial aid? i just cannot take this course anymore",

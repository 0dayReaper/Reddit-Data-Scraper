    "postText": "Feel free to introduce yourselves! Let us know about your major, your interests, and your overall opinion of Hunter College. Talk about your first impressions if you attended class last Friday, and what you're taking. Tell us if you had to evacuate your dorm for Hurricane Irene!    \n\n\nWe don't have many readers yet, but I'm sure that will change over time. \n\n\nAs for me, I'm a psych major and this is my second year at Hunter (although I transferred in from another CUNY school, making me a Junior). I've had an excellent time in Hunter so far and have met a handful of wonderful people here. If anyone is considering majoring in Psychology and has any questions about which professors to take or the department in general, I will gladly do my best to answer them.\n\n\nClasses I'm currently taking include:\n\n* Psych 230\n\n* Psych 235\n\n* Psych 248\n\n* Russ 103\n\n\nNow post yours!",

I should be graduating this semester but I opted to finish pre-reqs for grad school so I'm gonna be around for another year and a half.\n\nI WANTED to take Anatomy and Physiology but all the sections filled up and no overtallies.  I was gonna bitch about how they never have any space, but then I realized they had 52 sections with 20 seats for each one.  I actually can't fault them for that. I anticipated this though so I epermited to take Anatomy and Physiology at Medgar Evers along with my epermit for Chemistry at Brooklyn College.  Barely a Hunter Student anymore.\n\nI am so sick of Hunter, but you can make the best of it.  I feel like I might have accomplished that slightly.",

But I got locked out of Microbio (which I desperately need for my major) and have to wait *a whole year* until next spring to take it. It filled up before my registration appointment even came up... fucking annoying.\n\nHunter is love/hate for me.",

Anyway, going for Computer Science (even though I know it's not the best school for that).\n\nI've always liked Hunter despite the pace of the city. I've never really made friends because it moves too fast to just sit and talk to someone. Luckily for me, I don't dorm. I live in the Bronx.\n\n* CSCI 135, 136\n* Math 150\n* SOC 213",

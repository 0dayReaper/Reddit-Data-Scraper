You learn everything from aleks. If you want an A in the class you have to take an extra test and do a semester long project. The data days are each worth 5% of your grade and there is 4 of them. Even if you prepare for them it\u2019s still very confusing the day of. Luckily aleks is worth a large portion of your grade. So if you do the homework assignments on time everytime you should be prepared for the exams and be able to pass. I was able to get an A- but I know people who did very poorly in this class. But if You\u2019re someone who is able to keep up to date on your assignments you should be fine.",

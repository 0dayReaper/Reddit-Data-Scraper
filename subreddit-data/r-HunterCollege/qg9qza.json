    "postText": "Hello all, Im currently completing an associates degree in computer science at a community college upstate (suny orange) and I have a few questions about transferring in the fall of 2022\n\nWhat is Hunter\u2019s computer science program like? Ive talked to a transfer advisor and they said they look for a 2.5 gpa and higher for their program so im not too worried about that. They also told me they only offer a BA in cs and I was wondering how that would affect getting a job after graduating. \n\nWhat is the best time to apply? The advisor i talked to told me I should apply in march but that seems kinda late so im a little confused on when I should. On top of that, I plan on living in the city when I attend so I was planning on applying for student housing.\n\nLastly, what is the student life like? I know as a transfer it might be different but I still was hoping there were a lot of opportunities to meet people.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who might have some answers to these questions :)",

You are expected to complete coding projects on your own(you can go to tutoring for help) and falling behind will be detrimental to your grade. if you have started your studies else where and have credits I assume you will be going straight into C++ coding classes. The teachers are nice and explain things clearly but the projects always felt like it was on another level than what was taught. \n\nApply asap, you are only too early if applications arent open yet. I didnt do student housing(I live in Brooklyn) and the student life really depends on you. You can def reach out to classmates and such(people tend to be friendly) but I feel like a lot of us are get in and get out type of students.  \n\n\n(All of this is from research and friends who are in the field)  Tech jobs are competitive but some don't even require degrees. Get the degree and study up different coding languages at your free time. The more understanding you have of the languages the more appealing your resume will look. If you have free time in college also look into internships. I tell this to a bunch of younger friends and family you have to start looking in college if you want to do well. Not to mention all the opportunities that are only available to college students.",

                    "comment": "Hey thanks for the reply. Honestly, from everywhere I\u2019ve read, no computer science program is *easy* so hearing something like that isn\u2019t too worrisome. Even now at my community college it feels that was sometimes, i think thats just part of the degree. \n\nOk Ill definitely get on to that  I\u2019ve still been researching some other good cs CUNY and SUNY schools. But did you apply with your high school SAT score, an essay, and teacher recommendations? The advisor i talked to said they weren\u2019t necessary (Ive maintained a +3.0 gpa my whole time here at cc). I\u2019m also the VP of our cs club and I do student tutoring so I was hoping those would supplement. Also, did you come from a cc in NYC or somewhere else because I\u2019m wondering how your credits transferred. \n\nLast thing ill bother you with.. Did you live in Brooklyn before you attended hunter? I\u2019m gonna HAVE to move to the city when I transfer so I\u2019m curious as to what the housing market is like. ive heard its not pretty so thats why ive been looking into student housing.",

                            "comment": "I applied like 6years ago so I am a little fuzzy but I think you don't really need all of that.(I also went to a cuny community college so it was easier to apply) Your GPA being 3.0+ is already very promising since Hunter does try to admit a lot of transfer students.(I remember them telling me they take more transfers than highschoolers) If you have applied to Cunys before this then it should be a similar process. Note that highschool and college transcript is probably necessary so order those ahead of time as they can take a week or two to get to you(depends on the school).Definitely check Hunter's website it has a lot of info as well as numbers you can call for more information.  \n\n\nMy credits were transferred without a hassle since I did come from another cuny in NYC, they transferred up to 60credits idk what the policies are today. I basically got all the calc and english and the extra misc courses done in community college and went into hunter focusing on CS. Also Note that upon transferring to Hunter your GPA will be reset the credits still count dont worry.  \n\n\nYes I did live in Brooklyn before college and as you heard the housing market is hot garbage right now so in terms of affordability student housing is prob cheaper. Note that student housing isn't next to the college so you will have to learn the subways in NYC(not hard dw). Again more info is on the website so def check them out.  \n\n\nFeel free to ask any more questions, I will try to respond when I can. Good Luck",

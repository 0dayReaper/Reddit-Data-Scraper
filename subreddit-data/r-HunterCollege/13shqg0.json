Also are we able to choose what language we want to be tested on?\nI took a Spanish CLEP exam but idk if hunter takes it (which is a bit upsetting if they don\u2019t, but not really since I got paid to take it \ud83d\ude2d)",

            "comment": "Yes of course you can choose your language placement. \n\nYou might want to ask your primary advisor if getting a good grade on the placement gets you FULL exemption (cuz I\u2019m honestly not sure lol). However I DO know that depending on how good you do you will be placed in a higher Spanish course like Spanish 102 or Intermediate Spanish (or if you fail then you\u2019ll just be placed in Spanish 101). \n\nHowever if you did good on your CLEP exam (3 or higher assuming it\u2019s from College Board) I believe you can get exempted. Again, discuss this with your advisor.\n\nRegardless if you get exempted or not I highly recommend you take the placement (don\u2019t be like me Spanish 1 and 2 are ez As filled with content i knew since middle school).",

If you f\u2019d up one part, you\u2019ll be placed into the highest level and you just need to pass that class and you\u2019ll be done with language. Hunter College should take CLEP if you score high enough. I\u2019m not sure about the scoring for CLEP, but for AP Exam, it\u2019s a 4-5. You could search up CLEP HUNTER COLLEGE for equivalencies.",

    "postText": "Is Hunter College\u2019s transfer acceptance rate really 29% ? I was suprised when I read it online. It doesn\u2019t seem to far from NYU\u2019s transfer acceptance rate of 24% From what I understood Hunter is moderately competitive. Anyone have any clarification on the accuracy of this? Thank you in advance!",

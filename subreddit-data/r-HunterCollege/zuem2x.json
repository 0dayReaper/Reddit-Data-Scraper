    "postText": "Adolescent education major here. Set to graduate in May. However I just got a C + in my stupid assessment course sedf 706. I\u2019m hoping it was a mistake, and it seems that the course is full for next semester, so I\u2019ll have to go into the waiting list. I either HAVE to get this trade changed or I HAVE to take it next semester to graduate in May. Have any of you not had to retake a class you didn\u2019t get a B in? For adolescent education specifically. Also, does everyone get into the class if they\u2019re on the waiting list?",

She\u2019s lenient and gives reasonable work and is giving asynchronous days for people to work on their assignments and dividing the papers into parts. Most of her reviews are truly about her interpreters bc she\u2019s deaf so they basically are her mouthpiece in the lectures and just read off her slides.",

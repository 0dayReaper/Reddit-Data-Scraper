    "postText": "Please give some advice! So I\u2019m taking math 150 right now to fulfill the math requirement, but decide to withdraw cause it\u2019s too hard for me since it\u2019s my first time learning Calc so I don\u2019t even know the basics. My friends suggest math 152 since it\u2019s easier. Should I take math 152 or is there any equivalent courses that would meet math requirement?",

STAT 213 you still need to study and do Homework obviously., but it\u2019s easier compare to Calculus. See if STAT 213 fulfill math requirement to graduate instead Cal 1. Double confirm with the undergraduate Math Advisor. The general advisors often give wrong advising.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I am applying to Hunter College and I am a high school senior as of now. I was wondering what topics did your college essay discuss, was there a supplemental essay, etc.? I'm planning on submitting an essay that follows a certain commonapp prompt (option #5) and was thinking if Hunter wanted anything specific. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!\n\nEDIT: I got in!",

Perhaps a person or an event in your life that\u2019s inspired you to pursue a particular career path. And if you are planning to major in English, get creative with your writing. \n\nFor transfer students it\u2019s a bit different. They look for what challenges you\u2019ve over come and why you\u2019re choosing Hunter to accomplish your goals. \n\nGood luck!",

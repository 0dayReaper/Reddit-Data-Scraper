    "postText": "Hi! I accepted my offer as a second degree student in early November, and so many things have been messing up and extremely slow. \n\nWhen I accepted, I was told that my transfer credits were going to be evaluated, but when I checked online they were not. I emailed yesterday and got a response today saying that they are starting to evaluate today and it will take three weeks. \n\nIn the CUNYfirst student center, my registration date was set to Nov 17. I went to register yesterday, and it changed to Dec. 1. By that point I am afraid all of the classes I need to take will be full, thus delaying everything further. \n\nWhen I applied, I declared a major. When I accepted, that major was still listed. Now my major is set to undeclared. \n\nI am frustrated because I am leaving a decent full time job to go back to school full time and work part time, but now am regretting this decision if Hunter is going to continue being such a headache. \n\nIs anyone else having these/similar issues with Hunter? Has anyone experienced this is the past?",

            "comment": "Same here I am a transfer and also declared my major and now it says undeclared. My transfer credit evaluation began 11/3 and was completed 11/11 although I received a message saying it could be up to 3 weeks. I also have to wait until 12/1 to register and am a little worried because I can\u2019t even use my degree works as a reference since I\u2019m in there as undeclared. I have an advising appointment on 12/2 so maybe I will wait until I speak with advisor because some classes are only available to declared majors and I don\u2019t know if that will become an issue when I try to register. \n\nThere is a form that can be submitted online to declare a major, I filled it out and submitted a week ago but no updates or response from registrar. It is a bit frustrating because I feel like I\u2019m in limbo.",

I like using degreemaps as a reference bc it's easier to read than degreeworks and it has every semester mapped out. \n\nThere won't be an update from registar after declaring a major.. just check your degreeworks and see if your undeclared changed to what you declared.",

    "postText": "I have created a gargantuan (extremely large) CSCI 150 study group on August 24, 2021. It all started when I emailed my \"Study Buddies\" members through the Navigate app. Then, when all classes become online on September 2nd due to the massive flood in our area, our Blackboard course became available, and the Blackboard system effectively allowed me to e-mail all students by selecting \"Tools\", then \"Send Email\", then \"Select Users\". When I send that e-mail, there was a membership growth from about 30 members to 150 members within 24 hours. Excluding bots, there are 213 members on my Discord server.\n\nIt is normal for students to make smaller study groups of single-digit size without potential problems. However, for study groups to exist with member count of triple-digits? One hundred? Two hundred? Even five hundred?! With study groups existing in this size, it may introduce opportunities to potential problems including approx. 1% of the \"bad apples\" (or even a single bad apple) not following the rules, engaging in academic dishonesty, bullying, etc. Even if someone were to make large study groups, organizing the server, recruiting moderators, and even implementing rules, there is absolutely no way to guarantee for one to check whether other members are following the rules, etc. (The hard part of this server is enforcing the rules) In other words, even though study groups were to be designed to have a benign purpose (helping others with homework), there would be \"bad apples\" that may use the server with a malicious purpose (bullying or cheating). In addition, if a professor were to find out that the integrity of the class may be compromised due to study groups, that professor might ask me to modify or remove some elements or features of my Discord server.\n\nSmall study groups (usually in the single-digits) can be made with little to no problem, because these people are the ones I know personally. However, larger study groups (especially the ones with large lectures) may impose greater risks. In the future, I really suggest that you ask your instructor before creating a study group of that size (100 or more members). Remember that running a large study group takes a huge responsibility!\n\nEdited to add: Having a large study group, using the official class name, *and* involving the entire class gives it the official status. Unless authorized by the professor, it is assumed that student-run study groups of this size would be unauthorized. (Certainly, few professors allow this to happen)",

The left column had key terms and concepts. while the right column was blank. I invited the entire roster with edit access and told everyone they are welcome to contribute. surprisingly, it always got completely filled out. \n\nDiscord wasn't a thing during my undergrad but i would assume it is hard to mod for large groups. \n\nas a side note, I recommend working in smaller groups along with people smarter than you.",

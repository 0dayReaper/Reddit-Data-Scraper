Since it is different than the ones on aleks, focus on those questions. \n\n\nIf i remember correctly it was unlimited attempts, what I did was take notes on all questions, tried to answer it if i knew the answer, and those that I didn't I found youtube videos that explained it well enough. and i would attempt the practice final again, after viewing. I repeated it a couple times and I did pretty well on the final.",

It was 42 questions, no lockdown browser, but you have to show your face on Zoom, and backtracking of questions is allowed. Some questions are tricky, some are pretty straightforward. I wouldn\u2019t say that practice test is very helpful but it gives you a good overview on a format. I did quite decent job with ALEKS exams (the lowest grade i\u2019ve got was 93%), but I was feeling flabbergasted by practice exam. also, there is almost no MC questions on the final, they are fill in the blanks. I hope this helps, good luck!",

    "postText": "quick question, I'm taking 1 class with a balance of 970$ and today's the last day to do this payment plan where I believe take 50% then the 2nd half April 5th\n\nCan hunter or bursar drop my class tomorrow, It says in the email past due and failure to enroll in payment plan will lead to inability to register for summer/fall until it's payed\nso does that mean I won't be dropped? I'm gonna speak to bursar tomorrow and ask if I can pay it off by April 5th without the nelnet because I don't have the money today...\nor if I'll even be able to enter the building even\n\nI know today's the last day to enroll in the plan but after that what happens, dropped or work it out with bursar to pay on my own by April 5th....  thank you and I know it's my own fault.",

Hunter doesn\u2019t often drop people for late payments, at most they\u2019ll add a hold to your account to prevent any further registrations.",

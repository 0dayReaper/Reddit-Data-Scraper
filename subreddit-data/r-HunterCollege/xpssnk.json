    "postText": "Hunter is my #1 choice mostly because of cost and location. I'm interested in going into the fine arts program next fall and I don't really care if it's amazing because with art it's mostly what you make of it, I just want to make sure it's not actively terrible. Any advice on admissions, the portfolio, or the program or experiences you had would be appreciated!",

If it shows you are still enrolled in your classes there you should contact the student help desk because it\u2019s a blackboard technical issue. If it doesn\u2019t show you are enrolled in the classes on CUNYFirst it is possible that you got dropped from your classes and that would be an inquiry for the registrar. Also, keep an eye out for any holds (such as non payment) as that could be a reason for being dropped, in that example you would also want to reach out to the Bursar to correct that if you paid. Good luck, I hope it all works out!",

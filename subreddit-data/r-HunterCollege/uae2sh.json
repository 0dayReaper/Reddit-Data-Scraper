I personally had a hard experience, I am a reserved person so this can come into the fact of why it\u2019s hard but lots of ppl do agree that it is cut throat out here.\n\nThat being said, once you are more closer to your major/committed to a major, it becomes easier since you have a community.",

However, there are also people who make a lot of friends at Hunter. Like everyone else said, if you are willing to reach out and talk to others in your classes and whatnot, it shouldn't be too big of an issue to make friends. You can join clubs and just talk to everyone and see who you're comfortable being friends with. There's so much stuff you can't account for over the Internet, so I would recommend you wait until you start your classes to see who you're actually comfortable befriending. Best of luck in your upcoming semester at Hunter!",

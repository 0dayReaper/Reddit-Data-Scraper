    "postText": "Heyo, transfer student here attempting to register to Hunter. It feels like with every step forward in registering for classes there comes two steps back. I submitted my major declaration form about a month ago and it was just processed for the wrong major. I learned about immunization holds a week before classes were supposed to start. I feel like I could have been more on top of it but it also feels like there\u2019s no help at all. Has anyone shared similar experiences with CUNYs or Hunter specifically? At this point I\u2019m considering bailing on this semester and choosing a different school for the rest of my bachelor\u2019s degree.",

You have to continuously email, call and even show up in person. Once they see that you\u2019re not going away, someone will help you. Other than that, you\u2019re pretty much stuck figuring it out on your own.",

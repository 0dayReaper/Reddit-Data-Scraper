    "postText": "Edit* thank you guys! Reading the comments does makes me feel a bit better. I was probably over exaggerating \ud83d\ude2d but I\u2019m glad to hear that the pros at hunter outweighs the cons.\n\nI haven\u2019t committed to Hunter College, but it\u2019s one of my top choice since it\u2019s a good school academically. However, it\u2019s pretty upsetting, disgusting, and annoying when I look at the condition the school is in\u2026at some point it\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s not at the same time. The elevators are constantly broken, some of the walls are disgusting, bed bugs, rat infestation, some of the ceilings are broken, etc. Why is Hunter College that bad compared to other CUNY\u2019s? (I\u2019m aware that this is also common to other schools\u2026but let\u2019s be honest, Hunters way worse) Do these people not care about their students?! No wonder that place looks depressing. I\u2019ve attended public schools my entire life, and they\u2019ve never been close to the condition Hunter is in\u2026I feel like that\u2019s one thing pushing me away from Hunter, will I be able to learn and be happy in that type of environment? \ud83d\ude1f\n\nAlso, I could understand why so many people leave after classes. I\u2019m well aware that hunter is a commuter school, but they don\u2019t even try that hard to make everyone connect with each other like most schools does.",

            "comment": "After being here for 4 years and graduating soon here are my thoughts:\n\nYea, I will admit its in a bad state--but not as bad state it was before. I have seen Hunter at its worst and I feel like now Hunter has been trying to fix atleast some of its building deterioration. They are constantly fixing the ceilings and anything they find broken these days. They just opened up a new and shiny floor of 5th library (although I will admit it took them long enough) but now they are focusing on making the 4th floor better. They are now trying to fix their building problems. The elevators are still is work-in-progress. You have to understand they are a public school, the amount of money they get is not any exorbitant from other systems of public school. They are slow but they are making progress. The bed bugs, roach, mice problems will be a constant war. We know NYC is filled with these things and as long we are in NYC there will be those visiting us. It also ties in the volume of students and the stuff they bring too.\n\nAt the end of the day, its your choice to attend. Just take a tour like some of the people already said and decide for yourself. I will admit Hunter has its faults but it also has it merit. Its not a bad school if you know what you are getting in for. Try to make friends in clubs. The anti-social thing is true but not true also because of commuter school problem. BUT, I have seen people with massive friend groups being formed here\u2014you just have to try. Best of luck.",

Yeah the elevators are kinda annoying and the construction is ugly, but the library is stunning and there\u2019s lots of cool spots in the buildings. The tuition is cheap and it\u2019s a public university, so I don\u2019t mind the budget being put towards Hunter\u2019s amazing staff of professors and the colleges many programs. The education portion is why I\u2019m there and it\u2019s worth some minor inconveniences (in my opinion)",

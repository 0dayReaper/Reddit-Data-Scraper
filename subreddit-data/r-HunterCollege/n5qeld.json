We understand that many students will have a mix of in-person and remote classes, perhaps on the same day, and we will make spaces available on campus for you to study or attend online classes.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to urge students to make sure they don't have in person classes scheduled for the same days that they have remote-synchronous classes and to not rely on access to remote classes in general while on campus. None of the campuses have made upgrades to their networks\\*, it might all work out fine but if it doesn't, the Fall semester could be even more difficult than the Spring when all of this started. Be especially careful with hybrid classes, make sure you understand when you are supposed to be on campus and when you aren't and try not to have remote-asynchronous classes on the same day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*(also worth noting that their facilities have not been updated either, they're all relying on mask compliance as their sole source for safety",

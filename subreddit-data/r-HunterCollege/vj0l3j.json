    "postText": "Hello I'm a new transfer and I want to declare Education as my major. I attended the new transfer orientation where they told me to contact utep. I've send multiple emails and called+left voice-mail but no one is getting back to me. The guy who I spoke to at the orientation said don't sign up for classes until I spoke to someone from that department but I can't get ahold of anyone. What should I do? Should I just sign up for just some general classes or wait until I potentially get a response from someone?",

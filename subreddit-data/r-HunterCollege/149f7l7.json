    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to begin a minor in CS this fall but I\u2019m confused as to whether precalc is a prereq or not. On the CS minor page it says MATH-125 precalc (which is no longer offered and is replaced by MATH-12550 precalc) is a prereq for CSCI-127 but when I emailed one of the advisors in the CS department (Josaline Marin Chacon) she said that there are no prerequisites for intro to comp sci. I\u2019m taking precalc during this summer term but would love to drop it if I don\u2019t need it",

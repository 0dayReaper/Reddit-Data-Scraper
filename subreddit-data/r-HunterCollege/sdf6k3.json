    "postText": "I\u2019m looking at the requirement for the Dean List at Hunter and I\u2019ve had a GPA of 3.5 and higher with A and B grades for fall and spring semesters and I had that in freshmen year since I\u2019m a sophomore now. I have not received any info on me being in the deans list. Can I automatically claim I\u2019m in the dean list or do I have to have someone email me saying I\u2019m part of it or do I have to sign something?",

Fall '21 Dean's List should now be listed. They did suspend it for some semesters due to COVID, although I don't recall exactly which ones. That may explain why it does not show for some of your past semesters.",

    "postText": "Hopefully this is the right sub for this question! I'm applying for an MSW at Hunter and I'm currently working on the application. However, I noticed the guidelines for the statement of purpose are a bit confusing -- it lists a maximum of 5 pages, but also says the essay should be only 500-1000 words. I don't see how these can both be true because that number of words could never reach 5 pages unless you made your margins massive. Does anyone who is currently applying/has applied in the past have insight into this? I don't want to submit an essay that is way too short or way too long.",

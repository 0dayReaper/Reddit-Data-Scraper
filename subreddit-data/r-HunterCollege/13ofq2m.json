    "postText": " I'm an incoming freshmen and I'm planning on majoring in computer science. When I look at the requirements in math it says I need MATH 15000, MATH 15500, MATH 16000, and STAT 21300. These are all level 2 requirements and I'm only level 1. I'm wondering if I need to retake it so I can be level 2, or if I can take these courses later in the year?",

I think you might have to still take them in your second semester as well. However, I will recommend that you take the test in order for you to be in level two since you\u2019ll end up having to take more math classes if you don\u2019t. I know someone who is in level 1 and is planning to take the test in a couple of weeks.",

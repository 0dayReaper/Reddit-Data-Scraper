I\u2019m having trouble with mine and the bursar office sent me an email about my balance, the semester is already coming to an end. I\u2019m just wondering if I pay it with my money and I end up fixing my financial aid, will I get my money back?",

            "comment": "Fafsa and Tap always takes a long time for it to affect your account. As long as your financial aid covers your WHOLE due payment for that semester don\u2019t worry your classes will not get dropped or anything like that. Even if the payment due date passes. If that\u2019s what you are worried about. I was in a similar situation got. I got an email saying that I owe money. But financial aid didn\u2019t hit my account yet and it covers everything. But I was worried about it so I ended up paying it all. cause I didn\u2019t know that financial aid takes way past the due date to actually hit your account. But I did get that money refunded after financial aid hit my account.",

Hunter's program doesn't even have national licensure.\nA 2 hour commute there and back is getting harder to justify as I realize more and more how many hoops and nuisances I have to go through just to be on a level playing field with someone else.\nBut Hunter has it's pros and for anyone else it would really depend on their circumstances.",

I totally understand how they're over thousands of students and not enough advisors and they are overworked...etc. however it would be nice if one of them can say what you just mentioned. It doesn't hurt to be kind, especially if it's giving out useful info surrounding your job. But I have been finding out answers slowly on my own. \n\nThat's a great idea to join clubs and research info on your major. I just changed mine , and I feel this is best. I will def. Consider joining clubs surrounding myself with those already in my major. \n\nThank you again :)",

The early accounting classes are easy to teach and learn, but later on make sure you pick the good professors, because some have accents and are not very easy to understand",

I\u2019ve heard of baruch accounting being extremely more difficult and there\u2019s also the grading curve where only 20% can get A\u2019s, 40% B\u2019s and so on\u2026",

I am thinking of choosing hunter or queens college over baruch because these schools don\u2019t have the harsh grading curve and I actually have a chance at a higher gpa than I would at baruch. If I go to baruch, I\u2019m worried of doing well and still ending up with a B- or C, because of the grading curve and what if a majority of my classmates do a bit better than me and they end up getting the limited amount of A\u2019s and B\u2019s that are given, you get what I mean? \n\nDo you have any advice about being an accounting major at hunter? Advice on the intermediate accounting classes and cost accounting?",

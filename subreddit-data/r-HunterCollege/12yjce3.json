    "postText": "I am going back to school in the fall for my master's in nursing and I was wondering what everyone else is doing to juggle between work and school. \n\nI plan on doing full-time school and work, but I'm worried that I might not have the time for both. \n\nHow are the classes usually scheduled for Hunter?   \nFrom the information I read, it's a 3-year program. 3rd year is clinical, do I have to pay tuition for the 3rd year too?   \nI know that it is clinical during the 3rd year, but do I also have to do some sort of clinical work as well while attending classes for the 1st and 2nd year?\n\nThank you",

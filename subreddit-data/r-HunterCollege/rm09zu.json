    "postText": "I graduated Hunter back in 2014 with a CS degree..I know that Hunter runs a  B.A of CS, not BS of CS.   However, i notice on my Diploma, it only says \"Bachelors of arts\", it makes no mentions of Computer science.  I would expect it to at least say \"Bachelors of arts of Computer science\", but no...it only says \"Bachelors of arts\", no mention of my major or minor (math).\n\nThis is weird, and my dad thinks i didn't graduate with my CS degree because it doesn't mention it haha.. I worked hard for the CS degree, it should at least say Computer science on diploma...Is everyone's CS diploma the same as mine? only Says Bachelor's of arts, no mention of Computer science?",

Group 2 was Ethnic Studies, and Group 3 was Women's Studies.\n\nWhen I was looking for a Group 2 course to take, nothing seemed all that interesting until I saw that Native American Lit was in the list, and it was a 300-level English course, which I needed for my major.  I checked with the English department, and they said I could do that for my Group 2 requirement and that it would also fulfill a 300-level course requirement for English.\n\nBasically, if it's how it was when I was there, you need one course from each group, but you can't use one course that's in more than one P&amp;D group list to fulfill two P&amp;D requirements (eg, you couldn't use CLA 101 for both Group 1 and Group 4).\n\nGroups 1 and 4 had tons of 101 or basic courses.\n\nThe course catalog should give instructions on how P&amp;D works, but even though you're prospective for nursing only, you can go to that department and ask them about P&amp;D.  Someone there should know.",

Like what other people are commenting, most psych 150 professors offer take-home exams and open-book or online exams. Brianda's exams are in person. They are multiple choice though. However, she uses her own questions and they can be tricky. Class average for the 2nd exam was around 70%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, shes nice. Drops the lowest grade and gives extra credit opportunities but I would prefer a different professor that provides take-home exams and open-book exams so I don't have to stress memorizing the topics and I can instead focus on understanding them. Not an easy A and you have to work a little harder in this class compared to other professors teaching the same course.",

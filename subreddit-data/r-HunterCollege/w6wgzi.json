They\u2019ll place you higher initially because of your HS Transcript, but if you weren\u2019t happy with your placement and took the MPT and scored low, it\u2019ll tell them that you\u2019re not ready for the level they initially placed you. \n\nMath 12550 is Level 1 and yes, Level 1 is ok. Generally those who are placed into Math 10100 should take the MPT to be placed into Level 1 or 2.",

    "postText": "My experience in the EDESL 791 language assessment course In hunter and my interactions with the Professor have been what I can only describe as a shit show . Specifically, I am struggling with completing a project that is 50% of my grade and feel that I am not receiving the necessary guidance and feedback from the Professor.\n\nAnd in the feedback that I and my fellow classmates do receive the tone is passive aggressive and at one point referring to feedback that she has not published or even made.\u00a0As the only grades that I have received from the professor is two grades from the beginning of March on google classroom.\u00a0\n\nAs well In an email exchange withthe Prof, she mentioned that my paper was not in the order that she asked for, even though I had followed the outlined project structure based on the syllabus.\u00a0 Furthermore, she mentioned being \"SO Lost\" in what my partner and I were attempting to create, the first time that I have created. So, I and my partner\u00a0agreed to redo it from scratch. When we did, she gave unhelpful remarks such as \u201cI doubt you were able to create good questions with that short of a text.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn an email that I asked about her inconsistences in her feedback . She had to clarify her feedback.\u00a0\n\nWhich I and my group partner find it frustrating as if the professor in question cannot make a clear and concise feedback in \"what she meant\".\u00a0\n\nI understand that I am in graduate school and some level of difficulty, but I and my fellow classmates are finding this class frustrating in this particular class.\n\n\u00a0 I am concerned for myself and for my peers.\n\nAs I am are reaching the near the of the semester, I find my anxiety level through the roof and as if someone has a grip on my heart that is about to pop and as if someone punched a hole in my stomach.\n\nI personally see myself withdrawing and attempting to start again from square one.\u00a0 As in my second attempt of doing this I feel like I would have a better understanding of what to do.\u00a0\n\nAs a side note I have already email the person that belive that is the chair of the department only for her to state that to do my best. But at this point I personally do not know how.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs well the downside of it is that I believe that this class it's only offered by this professor and I am tempted to take it in the summer as I know that this project will be possible for us to complete under two months.\n\nNow after my group's recent zoom meet with the prof she (finally stated as we went over with her what the learing objectives should focuse on and what the constructs should look like.\n\nI even went so far as geting help from my classmates but even with all that help I fell like I am fighting a loseing battle\n\nif you are in this class or had this class I would like to now what in the hell she has approved if possible",

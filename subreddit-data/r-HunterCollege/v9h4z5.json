    "postText": "I met all the requirements for the Dean's List for Spring 2022, but it does not say anything about it on my transcript. It does say Dean's List for the previous semester. Is anyone else having this issue? I'm wondering if they just don't repeat it if you've already qualified. But it's a term by term thing, so I would expect it to be there again. Perhaps they have not compiled the Dean's List yet? Any feedback is appreciated.",

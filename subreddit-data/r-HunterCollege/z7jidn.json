    "postText": "I am a non-cuny transfer student set to start next semester, so I am still getting to know the system. I intend to take BIOL 10000 and I noticed that the scheduler does not list any lab sessions. Is there a different class name/code for the Bio Lab sessions? Or are we supposed to sign up for these sessions after registering for the course? If so, how is the registration usually done?\n\nSecond, I work full time and intend to take 3 courses max next semester to get warmed up to pace. I work in an office where I can work on my homework on and off and won't be chewed out by my boss as long as they see me work when they pass by. However, due to the schedule being 9-5 I am cognisant of the fact that I may have to leave or look into part-time positions (scarce) to accommodate school. If anyone who has been in a similar position would like to share their experience and advice, I'd really appreciate it!",

If you really want to take 3 classes, take bio and 2 filler classes to ease in. My suggestion. Good luck.",

I am personally seeking to apply for the Medical Lab Science BS program, so I need to meet the Bio requirements first (I also find it a bit concerning that I cannot find this major in DegreewWorks using the \"What If\" function, I've been trying to do that for a while).",

There, it says that the registration timeline for Spring '23 is December 1st to January 31st. Depending on the student/year/etc you may have a different timeslot to register. If you are not able to see this then I think the next best thing would be to check in with the Registrar's Office about your registration deadlines.",

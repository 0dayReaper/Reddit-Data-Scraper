    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm currently a 12th grade senior who has committed to Hunter College. I plan major in comp sci and transfer for my 2nd year to Stony Brook but the requirements for the Comp Sci major seems impossible.\n\nComputer Science &amp; Information Systems:- Advanced Object Programming/Object-Oriented Programming- Data Structures- Discrete Math- Calculus I and II- 3.2+ cumulative GPA- B grades or higher in prerequisite courses indicated above- No retakes in prerequisite courses listed above\n\nI'm wondering how I can take courses that will translate to these courses in Stony Brook.  \nThank you very much!",

And if I do some comp sci required classes on the side, I'll probably have to graduate in 5 years right?",

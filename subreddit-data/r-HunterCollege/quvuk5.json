Pace yourself really well cause if you don\u2019t you\u2019re gonna be stuck doing easily 15+ questions in roughly the last 10 minutes. Just study previous exams and any concepts you really didn\u2019t understand and focus on the material she reviews more frequently as it\u2019ll most likely show up on the exam.",

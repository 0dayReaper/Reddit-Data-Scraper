    "postText": "I thought I'd bring to attention a very important reality about how you spend your time in college, that sadly many people are totally unaware of.\n\nIf you have any interest in going to grad school or any kind of master's program, you are going to need letters of recommendation from instructors that you had at Hunter. \n\nAlmost all graduate programs require letters of recommendation from full time Professors. That means any letters of recommendation you receive from adjunct professors are not going to be accepted. \n\nThe main difference between full professors and adjuncts is that Professors are full time employees and adjuncts are part time. \n\nYou can find out which instructors are full time and which are part time on your dept.'s web page on the Hunter website. \n\nThat way you can make sure to take at least a few full time professors while you are at Hunter. \n\nI realize many people are not yet thinking about Grad school, but it doesn't hurt to leave the option open to yourself.",

            "comment": "Another thing you should be thinking about as you consider who to ask for rec letters is that letters from graduate students don\u2019t carry very much weight, unfortunately. Graduate students are often very good teachers, often better than full professors, unfortunately, but people on admissions committees will wonder why you\u2019re not getting letters from full time faculty members instead.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a student from another university who got accepted to Brookdale for NYC summer and I was wondering how bearable Brookdale is in the summer. The cost is amazing ($800/mo) but I am unsure about the unhomey vibes and no A/C. Could anyone give me some insights on their experience? Thank you so much",

The floor I was on was not amazing because people rarely cleaned up after themselves, not to mention the smells in the hallways. After all, some people didn\u2019t shower. Honestly, to each their own, but for me, I had to leave.",

To make it a little bearable you have to open both windows all the way. Doing this makes it so noisy because you hear literally everything from outside. I was on the lower floors which made it worse since I\u2019m constantly hearing ambulances. But if you\u2019re a heavy sleeper and get a good fan, you\u2019ll be alright. You\u2019ll have to take cold showers often to cool off.",

Get a standing one from Costco or any third-party selling place for cheap. Brookdale can be dirty at times as other people have mentioned but it is a cheap alternative to other dorms and places. Public security can also be a complete ass at times. However, it is bearable and you do get what you pay for.",

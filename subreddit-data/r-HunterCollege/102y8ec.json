    "postText": "Long story short for last year\u2019s spring semester, I went through major depression and had lack of focus on my studying and got an F on my organic chemistry class which affected my GPA and caused my financial aid to be put on hold. I retook the class as hunter F repeat policy and got C this time which should put me back in good academic standing as my F grade which I got before shouldn\u2019t be calculated into my GPA as it states on policy but for some reason it is still being calculated in and it is putting me in bad academic standing by literally .02 points. I tried to contact my advisor to figure it out multiple times but could never get connected with her as she always misses appointments. Who should I contact about this problem because new semester is upcoming and I don\u2019t want my financial aid to be put on hold again.",

Also, use a GPA calculator to determine what your GPA should be with all grades except the overridden F. (You can access a GPA calculator [here](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/grade/gpa-calculator.html)). If the GPA is not correct on your transcript, email the Registrar and inquire.",

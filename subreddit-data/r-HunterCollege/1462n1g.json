    "postText": "After finally getting Excelsior back in March for the Spring Semester, I apparently now have to verify my family's 2020 income in order to keep the scholarship. I legit did everything they asked, uploaded the required docs, called their office to talk to a representative to upload them again to another email, and it still hasn't been updated. How long does this stuff take, I've been doing it for months atp and I'm gonna call them again next week but I have to wait until Friday cause there are no slots open for any other day except then. It's honestly ridiculous how slow they are at responding, like why??",

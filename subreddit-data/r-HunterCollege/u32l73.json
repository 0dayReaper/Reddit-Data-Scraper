            "comment": "Its a tough program, both because of content and not the best structure. There isnt really much of a support structure, and professors can be awful with communication. Professors can have high standards and dump a lot of work, which is fine imo since theyre trying to weed out a difficult profession\n\nThis is my second degree, so I was ready for the work load and time commitment. But i came from a smaller program with more intimate professor student relationships, and so my biggest issue is how little the school tries to guide you",

            "comment": "Avoid it. The program is without any structure, a few dogshit professors (Jordi, Shankar, Raffi), very little help, no good advising or recruitment. Our \"coordinator\" literally sends Juniors and Seniors internship info the day before the application deadline. I'd go to Brooklyn or Queens personally, unless you actually know what you're doing already (2-3 years of programming + a plan to build your own projects and leetcode).",

I heard many CS programs teach data-structures, algorithms, object oriented programming. But looking at the degreemap for hunter I dont see any of those classes. Were the things you were taught at hunter useful to you when It came internships and projects, or did you mostly learn your self?",

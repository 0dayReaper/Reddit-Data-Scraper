    "postText": "Hunter is my dream school to do a second bachelors because it is cheap and affordable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering how feasible it is to do a double major in Chinese and CS \\[with concentration in Bioinformatics\\]. These 2 majors are the reason why I am so interested. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI checked with admissions and I don't have to do the liberal arts general requirements since this is my second bachelors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also already took calc 1and 2, bio 1 and 2, genetics and organic chemistry for the CS with bioinformatics track. \n\nIs it possible to do flagship Chinese and CS with bioinformatics? How are the quality of the classes? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I have no insight into doing these two as a double major. However, I can tell you that CS courses fill up quickly (especially those with preferred professors) and second degree students register after everyone else. That is going to make for a challenging and frustrating combination.",

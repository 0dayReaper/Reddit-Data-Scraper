    "postText": "So in the summer I took 6 credits and paid for them in full because it seemed as if I wasn\u2019t getting aid. 2 weeks into the summer I get an update that I was getting not only a pell grant for the summer but scholarship money from hunter. All of these were disbursed back in July and I\u2019ve yet to receive a refund. Is this because I\u2019m still paying off my fall tuition? Would anyone happen to know if going to the financial aid office in person will help?",

This aid will first be applied to ur tuition balance, so if you still have a balance for fall you might not get a refund back depending on how much aid you have/balance you have left.",

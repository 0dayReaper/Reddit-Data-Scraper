    "postText": "Hi guys! \n\nI'm supposed to be graduating this spring semester and I had epermitted a microbio course at BMCC. My grade for the course is still not in and although I've emailed my professor about it, I was notified by the degree audit people that the current issue with my graduation application is my epermit course and that the issue needs to be resolved by June 1st in order for me to be able to graduate. However, i heard that it takes about 6-8 weeks for the grades to transfer over, so is there anyone who can confirm whether or not I will be able to graduate? I've already committed to a nursing school program in the upcoming fall. Thank you in advance!",

See following link:\nhttps://hunter-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/policies-and-requirements/academic-requirements/course-policies/courses-at-other-accredited-institutions-epermit\n\nAs soon as the grade is uploaded by the host college, VERY NICELY beg the registrar to update your transcript so you can graduate. No guarantee they will do it but worth a shot!",

I don't need this course for any of my majors or to satisfy any graduation requirements but I ended up choosing to apply to nursing programs last minute and the course at Hunter was out of seats. From what I recall, my request was denied a few times and then approved by the Biology Department. I'm going to try my best to resolve this but thank you so much for your help!",

So you wouldn't repeat the core. The issue is financial aid. You can only do one at a time if you're using aid. Also be aware that if you do use financial aid that you can exhaust your aid. If you lay out of pocket you can do what you want.",

The flexible core, electives, stuff mentioned above are what you'll take first-and-second years, so if you plan well and jump on it, you could graduate double-major, or triple, etc.",

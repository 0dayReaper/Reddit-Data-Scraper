    "postText": "So I am applying for Hunter Fall 2023 as an International student. I recently submitted my application, but from my application to-do list it still says that high school transcript and undergraduate transcript are required even in the column where it says\" Transcript\" says my secondary graduation certificate and undergraduate transcript is recevied/not evaluated. Does that mean no further action is required from me? I've emailed the admissions office a few times, all I got from them is that it takes 6-8 weeks to process the document, but I hope nothing is missed out from my side since the deadline is February 1st.",

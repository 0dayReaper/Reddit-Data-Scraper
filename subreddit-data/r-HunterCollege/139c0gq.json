Like it will say \u201c This section has 30 reserved seats for learning communities\u201d. The problem is that in a class with only 35 seats that leaves everyone to compete for only 5 seats\n\nIm wondering what does this phrase mean and how can you tell what learning community its reserved for? Would I be able to get in off the waitlist if I register for the section or are each of the 30 seats guaranteed to be filled? \n\nThis is my second time registering for classes and the lack of sections to serve all the students and rules about each section are so frustrating. This issue alone makes me want to transfer\u2026.",

Everyone in their first semester at Hunter is given a schedule based on major/undefined and they\u2019re assigned a group of classes. I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s what the learning communities are. Cuz typically if it\u2019s for honors students (Macaulay) or athletes it would just state that. \n\nNot sure if you can tell what community it\u2019s reserved for cuz if it is for incoming freshman, current students don\u2019t need to know that information. You can still join the waitlist as it\u2019s pretty possible a student could drop the class or drop admission during the summer, but I\u2019d still enroll in another class to secure the credit/requirement if you\u2019re not the first spot on the list.\n\nSorry you\u2019re having trouble signing up for classes :-:",

            "comment": "Hi! YAY, congrats on your acceptance!!! They say it very competitive to get in :)  \nThis is for the BSW, right? You'd need to get in contact with the field coordinator. They seem to change ... every year, so I don't have current contacts. But you can try these:  \n\n\n* Annie J Pressley | College Assistant of BSW | [ap3111@hunter.cuny.edu](mailto:ap3111@hunter.cuny.edu)  \nShe answers basic inquiries, but can direct you to the right contact / what's going on with the BSW program.\n* Abigail Miller | Assistant Director of Field Education | ami0014@hunter.cuny.edu  \nMention you're a BSW (I believe she works with both BSW &amp; MSW)\n* Patricia l Dempsey | Director of BSW | [pdempsey@hunter.cuny.edu](mailto:pdempsey@hunter.cuny.edu)  \n\n\nI suggest you to reach out to areas in Long Island on your own as well this summer. So long as they have a LMSW who's available to supervise and is SIFI certified, in case the school takes a while getting back to you. Look out for orientation emails mid August! Hopefully those emails are sent earlier.",

She assigns the AD's, hopefully will assign yours soon. AD's coordinate and connect students with placements. You let them know what kind of experience you're looking for, what kind of population, etc. Hope you specified this request/preference to her, some AD's are unfamiliar with agencies in Long Island. And then, I have similar advice for finding your own placement (as a back up), if you're able to. Otherwise, for some reason I think Abigail Miller may or may not have knowledge on that as well if you want to try, even though often they tell you to stick to your AD. Good luck :) \n\nI'm not much help past this, but feel free to dm me. Continue to follow up throughout the whole summer and use it to find placement! This process can take a whiiiiile for some.",

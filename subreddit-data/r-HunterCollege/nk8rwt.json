    "postText": "I am an incoming Freshman for the Fall 2021 semester, and I have a scheduling question. I noticed on CUNYFirst that registration begins on June 1st, and I have a created a\u00a0schedule that I like during my own time. However, I was informed that we would be given a pre-made one based on the Learning Community we selected. I have an advising session for that on June 8th, but will I be able to enroll according to my preferred schedule on June 1st?\n\nAnd can freshmen pick which language class they want to take? Or is that also pre-programmed for them?",

I'm not too sure about which eng ap you took because all students are required eng120/220. since the ap credits are not in yet, for math they would advise you to take the math placement exam",

At schedule advising you should bring up your ap credits and see what class you need to take instead.\n\nFor example, I took AP English language so I placed out of ENGL 120 and am taking ENGL 220 instead.",

You will need to make up the rest of the credits with a concentrated study.\n\nIf you have no credits and do not take a placement test, you take all the classes for that language until you have completed 12 credits of study.",

    "postText": "I saw that it's being offered as a summer class and I know that the summer semester is considerably shorter than the regular fall or spring semesters. I was wondering if anyone who has taken this class in either semester can enlighten me and help me come up with a decision. How was the workload? How much time did you dedicate to studying? How difficult is the class? Thanks in advance! :)",

The class is online though and you'll be expected to do a some teaching yourself. I'd say take it in the Fall because if you do in the Summer you'll have even less time to write papers since the semesters shorter, it's a writing intensive afterall",

            "comment": "Given that the only classes open rn are in person that means on top of the 10+ research pages you have exams, db, homework etc. so you\u2019d have to dedicate your entire summer to this basically. During spring/fall you\u2019d definitely feel the intensity less but it\u2019ll be intense either ways since it\u2019s a writing intensive class. But good luck in whichever you choose!",

            "comment": "I am currently in the Psych 250 class now (Spring Semester). I have found the class to be rigorous and fast paced. There are only 27 people in my class so having relationships with fellow students and the professor is made easier. I imagine that if you take this as a summer course the student count will be less. If you stay up on the due dates and do a little bit of work regularly it isn't too bad. The class that I am in, it's not as statistics focused as I had previously thought, however, we do use JASP to analyze our data. Don't get me wrong, we still have to deal with statistics, in terms of knowing different experimental designs, applying that to research and being able to understand the JASP output, at least for me I was expecting it to be more number heavy. If you do take it during the Fall semester, perhaps have your other classes in that semester be less rigorous so that it is easier to balance. I imagine that since the summer course is expedited, the class will go very fast but if you have the time and energy to be ready for that, it could be beneficial for you to sort of get it out of the way. In regards to pace, I would suggest the Fall semester.",

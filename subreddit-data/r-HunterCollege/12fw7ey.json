I am taking a class called \"Sociology of the Gig Economy\" and am writing a research paper for this class.\n\nThis research paper intends to examine the impact on the social/emotional well-being of Latino/a/x/e adult gig workers who worked during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Anyone over the age of 18 is welcome to participate.\n\nIf you (or anyone you may know) is interested in participating, please click the link below to complete the short survey.

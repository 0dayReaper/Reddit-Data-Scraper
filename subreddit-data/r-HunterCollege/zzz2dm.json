            "comment": "I got an A+ for math12550 this semester. DiCapua for lecture is good. By that I mean he is chill doesn\u2019t care if you are not paying attention. But then again why would you because everything he says, every example he does is straight from the online textbook. It is mostly just self study. But that\u2019s good because during that time you can spend doing other work. He is pretty chill when it comes to assignments. If the class tells him he will change the due date and he does give 5 points extra credit for every exam except for the final that\u2019s if you do the extra credit work he posts and it\u2019s not much honestly there is no reason not to do it. Plus he posts a lot of helpful content on lumen like YouTube videos, the whole section of the textbook that corresponds to that topic,plus other examples ,study guides,review questions and the answers to them plus the reference sheet he will give on the exam. Also just to let you have a heads up when you finish any exam for his class make sure to hand it to him in his hands and WAIT! and see him put your exam in the pile with all the other exams. Because I gave him my exam he had it in his hands and I left. But then the week after when he was giving the exams back apparently he lost mine. It fucked up my schedule because now I had to study extra time to retake that exam plus I had another exam for his class that same week so I had to study for that and also go over previous material because the final was the next week. Sometimes the schedule for his class is behind so you might have to move quick with everything and study double time. But that depends on when your class meets because of holidays and stuff like that. Then for recitation Aravindakshan C Panicker is actually a gem. If I could take him again I would do it in a heart beat. He is so understanding with everything, he is funny and he actually cares about you understanding the material he teaches. And he teaches it in a way that literally anybody and I mean anybody could get. Plus the work he gives even if you don\u2019t finish it during regular class time it\u2019s ok you can just give it in the next time you have his class. Plus if you get a bad grade on a classwork you can just redo It and submit it again for a higher grade. He is actually goated.",

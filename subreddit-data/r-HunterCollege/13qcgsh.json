    "postText": "Hey all, is it a bad idea to change majors from Sociology to Biology as a newly admitted transfer junior student to Hunter?\n\nI applied to Hunter with my Associate of Arts with a Sociology major, hoping to change it once I was registered. The only thing is, I just read online I would need approval from the department head before doing so. I emailed all the bio professors who are involved with bio major declarations, but scheduled a meeting with sociology major just in case. They haven\u2019t responded yet, which I mean I only accepted my offer to Hunter yesterday which is when I emailed. \n\nWill they say this isn\u2019t possible because the biology department is already full or something? How likely is it that Hunter would somehow disqualify me from registration after already admitting me? \n\nFor context, it\u2019s Biology for an environmental science/ecology track.",

            "comment": "You should be able to change majors. However, depending on how many courses you will need to complete the major, changing at this point may delay your completion date. (You will need to determine that based on your transfer evaluation and requirements for the new major.)  Professors and department chairs are very busy this week getting final grades in (due on Friday) and then headed off for summer break, so be patient with replies.",

I\u2019m okay with extending the graduation; I used to think I wanted to do social work at a nonprofit until I actually did various roles in it for years and came to realize it\u2019s not for me. However, I\u2019ve loved everything I\u2019ve done in ecological field work, and studying wetlands, plants and wildlife has been a passion for some time. I\u2019m just glad I figured out what a career path could look like for me at least before finishing a Bachelor\u2019s, though I\u2019m nervous of going the biology route at Hunter which seems to be known for being pretty ruthless on bio majors. Again I appreciate the tips especially irt professors being busy at this time, dually noted and respect this.",

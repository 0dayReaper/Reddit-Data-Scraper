    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a poli sci student at UConn and absolutely hate it. The university definitely has a cultural issue and I\u2019m considering transferring to Hunter. I live in Queens so that would eliminate my hours long commutes. UConn covers a good 85-90% of tuition but still paying a good $5k out of pocket per semester. \n\nLooking for thoughts and insights on Hunter\u2019s culture, sense of community, and is Hunter generous with financial aid?",

            "comment": "When you say cultural issues do you mean a lack of diversity?\n\nHunter is extremely diverse and I think anyone would say that without hesitation, but I transferred from a PWI so it was super relieving. Most people can go to CUNY totally for free with TAP. As far as community building goes it\u2019s a little tougher because Hunter is such a large commuter school, so thousands of people are constantly coming and going. Everyone living in different corners of NYC also contributes to this, it\u2019s not like a small city or a college town where everyone is kind of around each other whether or not they\u2019re in school. From what it looks like in the halls and from my own personal experience, it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone has any trouble making friends though. I think maintaining relationships might be the tough part, but obv not impossible like with most relationships. \n\nWith all of this in mind (commute time, cost, diversity) Hunter seems like the right choice for you.\n\nPS hunter isn\u2019t paying me and I\u2019m not on their admissions team or anything lol I\u2019m just having a great time after transferring from a private school and have become a strong advocate for public schooling as opposed to private cus of my experience",

I went on a tour last week but I know that tours don\u2019t give you a full view of a place.",

Definitely less pressure to be a part of something at a school that\u2019s diverse to begin with. Glad this was helpful!",

Probably easier to get city internships just bc now you\u2019ll have the networks / programs to offer u them. It\u2019s very diverse. It doesn\u2019t have a campus culture but lots of clubs to help find your crew like anime club, different POC clubs, Greek life, business club, dance and fencing, etc. If you hate UConn that enough is worth leaving. The smaller classes like lab are where you\u2019re more likely to form friends without clubs. If you want a more social experience then dorm at 51st, brookdale, New Yorker hotel, etc",

She's nice but her exams are hard. She allows one page of cheat sheet during exams but sometimes that's not enough. She gives you the opportunity for extra credit though and you can get up to 10 points added to your exam grade.",

I have Sharon, she\u2019s amazing but other ppl have different Recitation Instructors, you can\u2019t chose the instructor you want bc you can\u2019t tell who teaches what section",

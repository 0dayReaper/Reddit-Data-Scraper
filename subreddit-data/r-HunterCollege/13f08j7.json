    "postText": "Hi everyone! A few students are trying to put together an official club specifically for Caribbean Latino culture! This would specifically include Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban heritage. We are trying to gauge interest from the student body and get the word out of the possibility of this club forming. If anyone is interested please comment or dm so we can start getting signatures and get chartered! \n\nThank you!",

This knowledge was passed down to me and I shall pass it unto you.\n\nAs another said the higher floors are usually safe to drop your loads. If you want complete privacy, where you won't need to worry about another sitting next to you poop themselves, go to the East building, 8th floor, travel around the corner till you get to the Career Development Services. STOP. Look Left. walk in (lights may need to turn on but they usually do). Walk forward 7 feet and turn left. You're looking at a single stall bathroom with a urinal. Go ahead. Bless the toilet. I'll wait. ",

People usually avoid it, knowing its a one staller, and go to the 5th floor. If they do walk in, they usually walk out and then go upstairs or wait outside. Privacy. Good Graffiti. What more could you need?",

Or conversely, the bathroom on the B2 floor of the library.\n\nI've heard that there's a very low traffic bathroom on the same floor as the gym in Hunter west, but I've never actually did the deed there.\n\nOtherwise, the higher up floors in Hunter North are good.",

No one will go there, be it West, East, or North - as long as you're not on a very common floor, you'll have a good amount of private time.\n\nIncidentally, however, I recognized my professor's shoes on the 12th floor bathroom of Hunter West. It was right before my class (the one that he taught) on the 13th floor of Hunter West. I don't know if he realized it was me - we never spoke about it. ",

    "postText": "Hi, am an upcoming freshman at Hunter. I\u2019m majoring CS there aswell but I received a Math milestone at CUNYfirst that says I\u2019ll be taking Math 101000. From what I researched, it\u2019s basically algebra but I already took that in HS. \n\nIs taking math 101000 required for upcoming  CS majors or this is some mistake and have to take a MPT? Please help.",

If you feel like you have a good grasp on Algebra you should take the MPT from  your score they will determine where you fit best. I highly advice you to take the MPT because MATH 100, 101, and 102 do not fulfill the calculus requirement for accounting, economics, math, pre-med, or science-related majors. Thus taking this course will be a stepping stone to place into a course that is needed but won\u2019t necessarily count towards the requirements for CS. I am pre-health and had to deal with something similar coming into Hunter. If you are taking a college course or AP exam in Math but will not have the grade/scores until June, inform your advisor and make sure that the score is sent to hunter . Sorry for the long post, but I hope this was helpful! Good luck at hunter !!",

On the appeal form say you\u2019re willing to do the workshop, they\u2019ll contact you through email probably saying you can take the workshop to change your milestone. Once you complete it and send them the certificate you\u2019ll be able to take whatever class you need in the LEVEL 1 courses.",

It says this in the announcements of the course: \n\nAfter you get 90 average on the 8 module tests and 80 average on the 4 written assignments, and if you want to take Math 12550, you need to complete the MachForm here https://ww3.hunter.cuny.edu/testingcenter/view.php?id=14381. Mention in the comments section that you've completed the level 1 workshop.\n\nMr. Michael Samra is the supervisor for this workshop, so when you fill out the form, for Faculty Coodinator Name, First name is Michael, Last name is Samra. Once he approves, you can go ahead to take Math 12550.\n\nAlthough it says you only get access to 12550, I got access to the entire LEVEL 1 courses because I needed access to stat 113. It\u2019s worth a shot to appeal first just to make sure, but the workshop is the easier route unless you\u2019re confident in your math/test taking skills, especially because they can\u2019t tell you to not use a calculator and it\u2019s not timed.",

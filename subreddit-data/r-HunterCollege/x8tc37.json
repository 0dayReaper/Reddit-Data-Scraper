    "postText": "First time dorming here at brookdale and I notice that my ps4 cannot connect to the Hunternet or Huntersecure wifi like my phone and laptop can. Surely there has to be some way of getting the internet for gaming systems(really just wanna watch Netflix on my TV). The only Hunter related internet that shows up on my Ps4 is Hunterdevices but that is password protected so I'm assuming we are not supposed to use that. If anyone knows how to get internet on a gaming system like the Ps4 it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSolution: use this link http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/it/it-services/repository/files/How%20to%20apply%20to%20connect%20your%20game%20console.pdf to register ur console for internet.  Or just type in hunter colllege connect ps4 and it will pop up",

So there's no way for me to use the browser to log into the gateway if can could never get in contact with the connection in the first place. I tried connecting to hunter via manually by typing in the SSID. Is there some website I can go to get authorization?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am an undergraduate transfer student due to start in the Fall 2023 semester. From my understanding the date for me to enroll in classes is May 4th, however when I go to enroll in the classes in my cart, I receive an error \"You do not have a valid enrollment appointment at this time.\"\n\nThe FAQ stated that there would be a specific page to check the enrollment time, however I cannot find that anywhere on CUNY First. The closest thing I could find related to this was the below screenshot, which is the Enrollment Dates page. Any help/guidance is greatly appreciated, thank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hh4ojv7tfuxa1.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=081fe01466dfe875b30c8bbf1efe7f7c97afe344",

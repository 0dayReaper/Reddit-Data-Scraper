    "postText": "Hi there, I\u2019m an admitted student at HC. I did some research that there\u2019s a Honor Program for CS major called the Daedalus program. I\u2019m really interested in applying for that program but I\u2019m wondering that should I apply now once I commit to Hunter (like after accepting their offer) or do I have to apply during/throughout my four years of HC, hence freshman year?? I also want to know some of your guys experience in CS at HC. I would to know as soon as possible please.",

[https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/scholars](https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/scholars)  \nyou can try and see if you can apply bc once you start at hunter you cannot apply for the program. daedalus is only for prospective students",

There will always be certain classes group of people don't do well. Anyways CS without the honor program isn't terrible. I think the main thing is that you get priority registration for your classes with honor programs meaning you get to register much earlier compared to non honor students and even most upperclassmen. I did however have two beginner classes that are Daedalus only which were interesting but nothing too special that you can't Google or ask for information.",

Honestly, I'd apply just for the priority registration, it's such a banger perk to be able to plan your classes way ahead of time and you make sure you only ever get the best professors sections, for all and any classes.",

The Daedalus app should be submitted alongside the HC app and you have to be an incoming freshman. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t apply to transfer students and the priority registration deadline for both apps was Feb 1 earlier this year. If you have any questions or concerns, dm me",

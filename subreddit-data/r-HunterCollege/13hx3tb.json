The test are difficult but you can manage as long as you are putting the right amount of effort in studying. I have not taken orgo at hunter but I can imagine it also requires many hours of studying. Also don\u2019t underestimate orgo lab, the work piles up. Working and taking these two classes together will be difficult, but if you are good at managing your time you should be good. My advice is, take once class at a time (bio one semester, orgo another), that way you don\u2019t burn out, and also allow time for yourself because that\u2019s important too. Good luck, hope this helps!",

I had to go to cardiology because the the homework I was getting at the time from 5-6 classes would be too much that I was skipping sleep. \n\nAlways go on ratemyprofessor and register for classes EARLY EARLY,  so you can take better professor classes",

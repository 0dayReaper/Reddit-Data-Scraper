I was wondering if Hunter had any psychology research opportunities (either research groups, fellowship with a professor, or similar internships) If anyone knows please let me know as it would help me consider if I should accept my admissions offer for fall 2023 (Im transferring from CC) Thank you all in advance!",

Once declared a psych major, you\u2019re added to the psych listserv where they email plenty of opportunities from research to internships and job positions both at Hunter and other institutions. There is also 300-level psych courses like 306 which allows you to do field research and write your own thesis paper under supervision of a prof most of which are psychologist outside of hunter. Overall, there are plenty of psych resources available at hunter, that I\u2019ve seen as a psych major.",

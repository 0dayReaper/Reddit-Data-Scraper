    "postText": "I\u2019m wondering how psych is at hunter and if it is more rigorous compared to other cuny schools. Many people have told me they transferred out of hunter due to its difficulty. Is it nearly impossible to achieve an A in classes at hunter? Do the professors give excessive assignments? Are the majority of the professors tough graders? I\u2019ve heard mixed responses so I just want to make sure before I decide to transfer here.",

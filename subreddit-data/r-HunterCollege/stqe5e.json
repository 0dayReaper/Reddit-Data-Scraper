It seems like none of the CS professors can be bothered to even reply to an email, and if you somehow do get a hold of them they seem super cold like they\u2019re trying to get rid of you. I have been to multiple different schools prior to Hunter and it\u2019s never been even close to like this, wtf gives? Is it just the CS department or are all the teachers here just shitty?",

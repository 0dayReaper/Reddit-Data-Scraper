So hey that\u2019s good, I don\u2019t have to take Algebra again but I will be taking precalc again so that sucks. But other than that what professor do you recommend to take CS 127 with? Who should I avoid?",

C++ is taught at the backend of the course. final is a lot of memorizing syntax, so it helps to be able to write code by hand, from scratch. it can be quite difficult but it\u2019s entirely doable if you take yourself seriously!",

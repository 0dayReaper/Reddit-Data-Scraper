But yea, navigating throughout the website is the biggest difficulties in all responses, and the functionality of schedule builder is the second. Fun fact, Hunter submitted the most responses, and the second most responses is my college John Jay. So thanks to all students especially Hunter students for supporting this research \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf89",

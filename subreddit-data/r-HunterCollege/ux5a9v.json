They offer summer LSATS boot camps and other resources as well. When I first signed up to be a apart I had an interview with Elise and we discussed an overview of the program and my intentions with law. It\u2019s great because she posts lots of opportunities and has many connections to lawyers and firms, so getting to know her can help with references and recommendations.",

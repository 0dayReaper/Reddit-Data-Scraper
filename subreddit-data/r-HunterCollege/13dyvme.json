However, depending on the class, it might not show until a couple weeks before the semester starts, and will only say \"Staff\". \n\nMost people pick their sections based on times, but if you want a specific professor, it is best to ask others about what time they are teaching this semester, and hope they are teaching the same time in the next semester.",

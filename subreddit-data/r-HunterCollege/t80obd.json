Recruiting post-grads for a math/comp-sci/physics discord since my program is too small to do it on our own.\n\nTurns turns out that math-focused post-grad student take many of the same courses despite being in different programs. Just started the discord today after frustrations with existing options. That said, please join, so we can gain strength in numbers in the early days.\n\n[https://discord.gg/y7hHJhnXUb](https://discord.gg/y7hHJhnXUb)",

    "postText": "I received a D for precalculus in spring 2021 and now I am retaking it fall 2021 and should receive like a B. The problem is that I cannot sign up for Calc 1 Until I receive a grade for precalculus second time around by the math advisors. Is there a way I can sign up for a class another way because space is being taken up everyday and I might not have a class open for a section that fits my schedule.",

I was in a similar situation, in terms of scheduling, and I just filled out the overtally paperwork and gave it to the professor to sign. \nAlso, once you get your grade you can use the coursicle app to tell when a class you want has a seat open.",

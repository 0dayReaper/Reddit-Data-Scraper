I've heard mixed reviews but I can probably safely assume the lab portion especially is hell on earth. I have already epermitted bio 1 and 2, and I was wondering if anyone knows the impact of epermitting A&amp;P as well? I know it'll be easier at another CUNY but I'm not sure if it has any negative impact on my transcipt.",

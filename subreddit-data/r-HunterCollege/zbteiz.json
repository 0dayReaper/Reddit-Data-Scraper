    "postText": "Hello, I was wondering if there are any transfer students here could explain their experience transferring to Hunter college? I am considering of transferring to Hunter, and I would like to hear some experience of taking the gen eds and fulfilling the requirement.\n\nI was wondering if I still have to finish the gen eds for Hunter college if I am a transfer student? How intensive are the gen ed classes? Were there a lot of reading and writing papers? Are the gen ed classes easy A? Can anyone recommend easy A gen ed classes.\n\nAlso, if there is any psych major here, I was wondering how intensive the upper-level Psych classes are? Also, are the classes easy to get a high grade?",

One the better decisions I made in life. \n\nBut again, was a long time ago.\n\nOh and I graduated debt free.",

            "comment": "Hi! So, I transferred to Hunter College in fall 2020 from a SUNY. I graduated last year, but I had an interesting experience, because I was a junior at my SUNY school when I had my light-bulb moment and realized I wanted my life to go in a different direction. When I moved back home to the city, I also changed my major, so I did have to do an additional year. Besides that, a lot of my credits did get transferred. I did find it difficult to communicate with advisors via appointments, they were faster through email. Any questions: email, email, email. Hunter is pretty quick with responding. It is annoyingly hard to talk to someone on the phone though.  \nIf you join the Hunter College Facebook group, you can ask for more gen-ed suggestions that are easy. Degree Works is a system that helps you see what you can take/what you are missing/etc, so that\u2019s a huge help as well.\nSome classes are easy A\u2019s, some classes you will struggle with. That is really a personal thing, depending on your strengths and weaknesses. I\u2019ve found my most challenging classes at hunter to be the most rewarding. Good luck!",

Or were you able to get them done pretty easily? \n\nAlso, how was your financial aid experience? Were the financial aid office helpful, or did you had a hard time with them?",

The username is your netid.   \n:\\_3: log off blackboard or whatever you logged into. Head over to the printer and scan id - the printer will open your printing queue. Select the files you want to print and press Print Release.  \n2nd option: use your device to send a email containing file (directions in image below)  \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935017122470445106/1015823671027306526/howto.png",

    "postText": "It says on the website that the School of Nursing does not accept repeated prerequisite science or math courses. I took CHEM120 Spring 2022 and withdrew from it and received a W on my transcript. Then I took CHEM120 Fall 2022 and got an A. Does that grade w on the transcript count as a repeated course? I am very worried. Please help me.",

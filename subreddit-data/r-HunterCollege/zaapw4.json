    "postText": "Okay so I have to take stats 113 since it\u2019s a pre-req for psych 248. Makes no sense how I need a math placement exam score or a lower math class just to take stats 113. I completed math 155 (calculus 2) at my previous college (my credits transferred in) so I technically fulfilled my math requirement already. Any help regarding this is greatly appreciated.",

If you have to take algebra or calculus, let\u2019s say, then calculus 2 would cover that. But if you have to take stats, I think calc won\u2019t replace that\u2026? \n\nI\u2019m not sure though because I\u2019m a nursing major and someone that I know took calculus from high school; however, it didn\u2019t replaced or waived the stat 113 requirement for nursing majors.",

    "postText": "the pre health office seems to stress it very much that all pre health students gain a committee letter for their applications. i was planning on becoming a PA but it feels like if I want to shoot higher, it'll be worse for me because the requirements for the committee letter are ridiculous. im assuming some people go on without one, but it just bothers me how much they require; it feels like i can barely control my application.",

If you wanted to aim for a good PA/Medical school focus on other portions of your application such as Extracurriculars and personal statements. And if they do ask in an interview why the lack of a committee letter just be honest if you didn't meet a grade Cutoff or something else.\nGoodluck! This place stinks",

Is that still the case? Anyhow, if you can do without it, I would. However, if you go into any field that \u201cneeds\u201d a committee letter, like dentistry, then you\u2019re out of luck. If you aren\u2019t, then you\u2019re fine. This is one of the reasons why I thought hunter is not a good pre-health school. Good research school, shit pre-health school. You\u2019re better off transferring out.",

I think the cut-offs are still the same and they aren't helpful. they literally bar you from applying for the letter if you don't have your file open for a year and the pre-req for that is literally there ppap seminars and that cannot be missed. I have personal reasons for missing them and they are like oh well, you should've been free, and I'm like you give me a bad registration date, have a stupid requirement. What do you think my reasoning should be for not having the letter when for me it was because I missed a few seminars and have to restart and that delays the whole application to open a pre-health file",

    "postText": "Hey fellow Hunter students,\n\nI am a senior at the school taking some journalism courses and was wondering if anyone would have some time to spare to do a quick 10ish question interview with me in the next day or so.  The topic would be your childhood and can be conducted at your availability in the Hunter area or on zoom if that helps.  Can't wait to meet an interesting purpose.\n\nThanks for the help everyone!",

    "postText": "It is 42\u00baF in New York today. I am sitting in the cafeteria near the air vents because I need to charge my laptop and I AM FREEZING. I am getting a headache from sitting here and I am shivering. I am wearing a huge puffed up jacket. I look like a teletubby with this jacket but I AM STILL FREEZING.\n\nCan someone please explain the logic of having the AC on? I am very confused. If it get sick, who can I sue? jkjk But I REALLY want to know what the logic is behind this. It is almost like they want me to be uncomfortable. Why would someone put on the AC vents when it is 42\u00ba outside? I need to know. I am about to quit college and go into hibernation. Thanks Hunter. Lol.\n\nTurn it off please.\n\nThank you.",

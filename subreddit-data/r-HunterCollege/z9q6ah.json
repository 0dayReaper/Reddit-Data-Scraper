    "postText": "I am taking BIOL 100 next semester but I also want to include 2 non-STEM courses so I can knock out my gen eds. Due to my AP Spanish transfer credits, I was able to get a language exception, so all I have to do is a 12 Cr sequence to fulfill the Hunter Core. For now, I can only take afternoon and weekend Courses. Are there any HC concentrations you recommend?\n\nRight now I have just been picking 2 random courses I saw listed on DegreeWorks to fulfill my Individual and Society requirements. These are WGS 100 and MEDIA 180. Would you recommend I just stick with these electives or that I  start chipping away at my Hunter Core requirements? Also, I am not clear as to whether we are allowed to double-dip courses for requirements? For example, if I take WGS 100 to fulfill my Social Science Gen Ed requirement, can I also use it to fulfill my Hunter Core if I choose to focus on Gender and Sexuality Studies?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",

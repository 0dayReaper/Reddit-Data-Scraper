    "postText": "transferred last fall in 2022, majoring in emerging media and I genuinely feel that it was a mistake coming here. I applied for both Hunter and City Tech but Hunter got back to me first. I've made the deans list last fall sure, but my dissatisfaction comes from dealing with the rush back home on the 6,  overcrowding and just the lack of supportive programs within the major. \n\nNo shade towards the FM dept, they clearly are doing the work to share opportunities, but it'd be really nice to be in a space where I can do a capstone project or something. Is this just pre-senioritis or is what im saying making sense?",

(Mine was a research project that culminated in a 35-page paper.) Think about how it will serve as a capstone for your degree program and/or prepare you for future studies. Make an appointment to meet with the department chair and pitch your idea.",

    "postText": "I recently transferred from a school that combined Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter tuition. In other words, the tuition for the Fall semester applied toward the Winter session as well. The same for Spring to Summer. So there was no additional cost in taking Winter or Summer classes as I\u2019ve paid the Fall and Spring tuitions. I wanted to know if this was the same at Hunter? Or if Winter/Summer tuition is separate from Fall/Spring. I asked my advisor but they hadn\u2019t known. Apologies for the confusion if my wording is hard to understand.",

My other option is Media 180, so if anyone has taken this course, are there any specific professors you really liked (or disliked lol) and why? Was it the workload, the way they taught things, etc. Thank you for your help",

You have six and a half days to complete them. Just participate cause it\u2019s 30 percent of your grade and you are fine.",

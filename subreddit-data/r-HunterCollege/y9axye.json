    "postText": "I want to pursue computer science to hopefully get a job in tech (dream job would be in videogames) but I was wondering what it's like in Hunter.\n\n\nI'm an International student and finished 2 years at City, trying to get into Grove School of Engineering and filling out semesters with a psych minor and liberal arts classes. My first year was completely online and so I couldn't focus for the Calc 2 math classes and ended up struggling a lot and got an F and D respectively (got a B the third time when we had in person semester again).\n\n\nIf I commit to transferring and end up not being able to keep up with classes at Hunter, or not get great professors there I don't even know what l'm gonna do. Asking all the Hunter students what it's like to study Computer Science (BA) there.\n\n\nBecause if I find out it's way too difficult I might just do a Multimedia Design degree at City college and try to do internships for experience. Any advice against this will also help greatly.\n\nTLDR; Want to learn what it's like at Hunter, and very confused about what to do.\n\nEdit: added stuff",

Keep in mind I was class of 2014 so it\u2019s been a while. \n\nThe CS program at hunter was not particularly great at my time. Very theoretical without a clear line between education and the job market, not much of a collaborative community that you would get at a typical engineering school, and some outdated beliefs on the side of the professors. I ended up finishing as a media major with only a few credits left. That being said, I have good friends who finished CS at hunter more recently and are doing great. Hunter feeds the best students into Bloomberg who pays well and Bloomberg is a great stepping stone to the ridiculous pay of the mainstream tech companies. Hunter will not stop you from getting a fine education and will not deny you a fruitful future. You get out what you put in etc etc\n\nAs for game development, the AAA industry in te US only really hires undergrads from certain universities: USC, Utah, and Carnegie Mellon are big ones. Certain companies have certain universities they prefer due to alumni connections, CUNY and other universities in New York are not well connected as you can imagine. Otherwise you work at game start ups or mobile for a bit and start navigating from there. The other option, which is what I did, was to do a graduate program for games. USC, Carnegie Mellon, UC Santa Cruz are all good choices but are all $$ so doing undergrad at CUNY is still a good option.  There\u2019s also the game trade schools. I\u2019m not sure how legit they are in general but I know Digipen in Seattle does funnel into the industry pretty well. The other thing is that game development is still very much based on the west coast. Even with remote work, they don\u2019t hire many remote juniors. One of the best ways into the industry is to find decent studios that are in undesirable locations. Vicarious Visions in Albany is an example. \n\nThe biggest thing to keep in mind is that video games pays significantly lower than tech. It\u2019s not even close. 5 years engineering in games can maybe get 90-130+. Higher paying studios exist like the one I\u2019m at, but that was a ton of luck and good networking. tech giants will pay you 300-400+ in that same time even if you\u2019re not a super star. It\u2019s an easier life but you\u2019ll have to find fulfillment outside of work. Games workers are definitely in it for the passion which also leads to a fair bit of exploitation. It\u2019s also significantly easier to work in tech after games than work in games after tech. \n\n\n\nGood luck. Feel free to DM if you want more info. Apologies if anything is incoherent.

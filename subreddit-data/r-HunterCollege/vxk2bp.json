    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am the writer and star of \"Not Paul\" - an original one-act romantic comedy about constantly being compared to your partner's ex that is DEBUTING JULY 15TH at the Producers Club in Hell's Kitchen (358 W 44th St). The play explores the topics of perfectionism, academia, post-college life, feelings of inadequacy, and reclaiming your self-worth. We would like to make the show more accessible for college students so we are offering a 10 percent discount if you use the promo code: STUDENT\n\nABOUT THE PLAY:\n\nThe play centers around a new couple: Mary and Ethan. Mary is Ivy League-educated and a successful academic publisher, while Ethan is a barista with a theology degree, uncertain of what he wants to do with his life. Their budding romance is complicated when Ethan learns of Mary\u2019s recent ex, Paul, her committed boyfriend of five years. Paul is a perfect man: he was top of his class at Harvard, a gifted singer, a talented actor, delivered speeches to the United Nations about the South Sudan famine, speaks seven languages fluently, and is a sexual god. Even during the action of the play, Paul is saving Ukrainian refugees.\n\nAs their relationship progresses, Ethan discovers that all the people in Mary\u2019s life love Paul to the point of obsession. Mary\u2019s elderly next door neighbor Greta was infatuated with Paul. Mary\u2019s college friends and recently married couple, Bryce and Stewart, follow the word of Paul. Mary\u2019s co-worker Sylvia reveals that she is pregnant with Paul\u2019s child and her husband, Perry, couldn\u2019t be more excited. All of them shamelessly compare Ethan to Paul and display open hostility towards him, causing Ethan to snap, as he begins to question himself and his relationship. Either Ethan takes charge of his own life or Paul\u2019s admirers will take matters into their own hands\u2026\n\nWE HAVE SIX PERFORMANCES:\n\nFRIDAY, JULY 15TH - 8PM\n\nSATURDAY, JULY 16TH - 8 PM\n\nSATURDAY, JULY 23RD - 8PM\n\nSUNDAY, JULY 24TH - 2 PM\n\nSATURDAY, JULY 30TH - 8 PM\n\nSUNDAY, JULY 31ST - 2 PM\n\nTICKET LINK: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/not-paul-a-play-tickets-339951834087](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/not-paul-a-play-tickets-339951834087) \\- promo code: STUDENT for 10% off tickets.\n\nThe show runs about 75-80 minutes. I hope you'll come out and see the show! Thanks everyone!",

Does that depend on different programs or is there one set date?",

            "comment": "PAX-RN\u2019s deadline depends on the college you\u2019re applying to. For Hunter, students need to take the exam by the end of February for admission into the Nursing School in the Fall term. \n\nThe best nursing school among the CUNY system would be Hunter. SUNY would be Binghamton or Farmingdale. For privates, there\u2019s a few. I would say NYU, Pace, and Hofstra. But they\u2019re very expensive, so there\u2019re many aspects to consider for private schools.\n\nI hope this is helpful!",

I\u2019ve been researching accelerated nursing programs for a while and my #1 is Pace University, they don\u2019t require much and it\u2019s an 11-month program, the catch is how much it costs, it\u2019s around 70k but it does not require the PAX \nHere\u2019s the link! ~ https://www.pace.edu/college-health-professions/departments/nursing/programs/admission-requirements-intructions/nursing-accelerated-bs",

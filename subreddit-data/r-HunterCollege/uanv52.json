Have a talk with the department head or your instructors as I am not finally sure if you need departmental permission to repeat. It\u2019s always good to ask the instructors, maybe they will be lenient.",

But if I drop this course I have to drop the lab component and the recitation which would make me fall wayyy under full time student .

I spent two years on the nursing program and got rejected (two years because when I was a freshmen, the first time learning community advisor only put me in CHEM 101 and not 100 because there were \u201cno seats left\u201d so i took it in spring and then this year did the next sequence of orgo chem. \n\nI got rejected from the program. I have no idea what to do. I searched a lot of options including transferring to community college but that would just take me even longer since the nursing programs there are three years and then another year to transfer and finish with a BSN. \n\nPrivate college is expensive.\n\nI searched Lehman (which is like 4 hours away from me) and York (I went on LinkedIn to see the job opportunities ppl get and found nothing)\n\nIdk what to do and in no way am I blaming any college or person but I feel so angry at myself and disappointed, I need advice really bad:( I would appreciate if anyone can leave anything plz\ud83d\ude4f",

He couldn't get into Hunter's program in his first and second year, then transferred or got a degree in something else (not sure what he was doing since), but now, I just found out that he had recently started Laguardia's nursing program.\n\nJust because you didn't get into Hunter's program doesn't mean that it is the end of the world, so please don't feel discouraged by that. You can definitely try other routes and can still choose to pursue in nursing. You can go with an associate's degree in other CUNYs, BMCC is pretty well known. Or you can stay in Hunter to pursue in other degrees or the Human bio degree. Many students that didn't get into the program chose to pursue in Human Bio. With a Human Bio degree, you may not get a job in nursing, but you can still get a job in the medical field.",

            "comment": "Honestly, I think a lot of Hunter's requirements for pre-health and nursing and such make these professions less accessible to students. So, even though you didn't get into Hunter's nursing program, I don't think you should beat yourself up for it. For now, I would recommend just taking some time for yourself and learning to appreciate yourself again--and then you can evaluate your options. Do you want to continue with nursing? Or do you think you would be happier in another field? Then, you can go from there. \n\nIf nursing is your dream career, please don't give up on it. Hunter tends to do that to a lot of students-- I started off with a bunch of friends who were premed and then now I'm the only one who's planning on applying to medical school, only because of how stressful it can be at Hunter and how unrealistic the standards are for Pre-health. So, like the others said, it's not the end of the world if you've been rejected from Hunter and you're not worth less because you've been rejected.",

I know some brilliant people who do really well on entrance exams, MCAT, DAT, whatever, and everyone says that Hunter sciences are unreasonably hard and Hunter themselves work against you. You can do really well and get a good score at another college, but at hinter, your chances of success are a lot worse because they don\u2019t give you support and work against you.",

If you\u2019re set on Hunter, don\u2019t do the biology or science majors because they\u2019re so ass. If you want the best chance at getting into med school, take a psych major, get all A\u2019s or something and study your ass off for the MCAT and spare no expense.",

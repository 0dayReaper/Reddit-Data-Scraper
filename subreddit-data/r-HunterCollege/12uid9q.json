I haven\u2019t had any bad experiences with professors except one and I dropped his class immediately and enrolled in another one. A lot of the professors are researchers and practicing counselors, psychologists and therapists as well as grad students and are great resources to advance your career and network. They\u2019re all very passionate about the field and I believe Hunter\u2019s psych department is more biology-oriented in terms of the research is done here (neuroscience and stuff).",

            "comment": "I'm a freshman and an upcoming sophomore. The Psychology department at Hunter are accommodating and ranked highly. You will get so many advisors who wish the best for you. Most lectures and classes are easy, with little to no homework. Harder classes are math/research requirements like PSYCH 248 and 250.  \n\n\nYou can map all the requirements out with Degreeworks but I find this website also helped:\n\n[https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/psychology/undergraduate/psychology-major](https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/psychology/undergraduate/psychology-major)  \n\n\nI wish you the best, I am having a good time at Hunter so far.\n\nOne professor I would recommend is Robert Ball for PSYCH 150. He's an amazing lecturer, tests are online and easy as he gives review sheets as well. There is little homework that can be done in less than ten minutes. He keeps students engaged by asking random questions throughout lectures for a half point of extra credit. He also includes simpson clips and plays music before lecture begins, overall amazing and such an easy A+.",

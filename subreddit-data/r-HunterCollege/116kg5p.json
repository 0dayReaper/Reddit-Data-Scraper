    "postText": "hey so, i just got waitlisted from hunter. here were my stats\n\nuw gpa: 88.8 (by the end of jr year) \n\nweighted gpa: 96.something \n\ndidn't submit my SAT score\n\ni took 11 APS including: AP world history, AP seminar, AP Biology (my average was 101 in that class) AP Language, AP Comp Sci (100 average) AP US History, AP Art, AP Government, AP Human Geography, AP Statistics, Ap Literature\nthe rest were advanced classes\n\ni had a lot of extracurriculars such as head of art &amp; music newspaper club, students against destructive decisions club, key club where i had over 100 hours &amp; was in the club for every year, SAGA/GSA Club, &amp; there was more but i cant remember. I worked at a summer camp for over 8 weeks. \n\nI wasn't in NHS because my school requires a 90 UW average. I struggled a lot sophomore year with helping my sick mother basically do any simple task. Also the year of covid. My essay was pretty decent.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. This was my top school &amp; this is so frustrating &amp; im honestly heartbroken. (Not to sound dramatic) I applied all the way back in November. Not sure if that makes a difference but I waited this long only to hear back from this.\n\nI have improved so much my senior year, &amp; I cant even write a letter of reconsideration because the website says I cant. I want to know my chances of getting in. I don't know if I can wait until May 15. I'm so nervous &amp; scared.\n\nHas anyone had experience getting off the waitlist? Or can somebody drop their stats?",

I know that when I applied, my stats weren\u2019t super great, but because I was applying for an English major (which is fairly competitive at Hunter) I was required to write an essay. I believe that is what got me in, because it showcased my ability to write. I\u2019m not sure if all majors require you to submit an essay, but that and your letters of recommendation may have been why you were WL. I really hope you get accepted! You sound like a good candidate with your stats. Any reason you didn\u2019t submit your SAT score? That might help your chances.",

I applied as a biology major. my SAT score was around 1100 something, with two tries. i know it's not good so that's why i didn't submit. \n\nis there anything i can do that you know of that will expand my chances? this is my top school &amp; i really want to get in. it's really frustrating that i've worked so hard in high school that i can't even get accepted into my state schools. stonybrooke shoved me into their program at a community college &amp; now i'm waitlisted at hunter. it's so dejecting.",

Are you an instate or out of state student?\n\nEDIT: I saw your other post in CUNY subreddit. So I would say reach out to your Admissions Officer: Tony Blackwell, and ask for possible reconsideration or what else you could submit to strengthen your application! Good luck!!!",

Tony is very nice and understanding, you could always ask if there\u2019s anything else that you could do or ask for advice.

It could also been your essay in all honesty \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f perhaps the grades you have currently is the determination for you not to get in because they believe you\u2019ll struggle at Hunter in their Biology program because Bio at Hunter is EXTREMELY hard.",

Did you apply to Macaulay or something like that, those often make the process a little longer. If you applied to the nursing program, it\u2019s very competitive so that could be a factor. But with your grades and your gpa you should have no problem getting in. Honestly just contact the office of admissions and ask them for updates. They\u2019ll probably tell you you\u2019ll know coming closer to your graduation. Also those APs are really gunna help you if you got good scores, they\u2019ll fill in credits for classes you need.",

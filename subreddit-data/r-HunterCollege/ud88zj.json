    "postText": "This is my first Reddit post so I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m doing this right lol this post is literally my last hope for any useful advice, but last Wednesday, sanitation workers came to my house and labeled my house as \u201cunlivable\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and kicked me and my other 4 family members out of the house. They told us to grab whatever we could within an hour. I live in Long Island and go to Hunter College in Manhattan. I have two sisters and parents and I\u2019m the middle child. I also have 3 cats. I\u2019m 20 year old female and a second semester junior. There are only a few weeks of this semester left so I really want to finish the semester but idk if I can. The sanitation workers gave us a buncha numbers for shelters and organizations to call for help with temporary housing. Wednesday night I slept in my mom\u2019s car with two of the cats in order to make sure they were safe overnight in the car (my older sister was able to stay with a friend for the night and took one of the cats with her). The rest of my family (mom, dad, younger sister) slept in a shelter that night. The next day we went to the social services department and after meeting with some unsympathetic and disrespectful workers, they gave us a hotel to stay in until May 2nd. Since last Thursday up until the present (4/27/2022), my mom has been sleeping in the car to make sure the cats are okay while my dad, younger sister, and I are in a one bedroom in the hotel. My mom actually found and confirmed a house to rent around last Wednesday after just searching and searching all day and one guy agreed to renting to us, took $1000 down payment from my mom too, but Sunday night he suddenly said his brother wanted to take the house instead. But later, we found out that he was actually cancelling so he could find a renter through a real estate worker. So he lied to us. So now May 2nd is approaching and I have no idea what to do.\n\nThe biggest problem is how much rent has risen over time, and ESPECIALLY during Covid. When I was younger, a 3 bedroom apartment was just around 1500 and now it\u2019s close to 3200. Plus all the houses have a broker fee now. My parents are immigrants from Pakistan and simply can\u2019t afford it. Plus, landlords ask for proof of income before letting you rent, and when they see the low income of my parents, they decline very quickly. I mean, tbh the sanitation workers were right about my house being dangerous. We haven\u2019t had heat in about 4 years, no stove for 4 years either, ceiling leaking, cluttering causing a fire hazard because we all are cramped in one space. Our space was so cluttered that some my dad put some of his stuff in the backyard. The lady next door (racist and mean) called sanitation on us, and they saw the situation and kicked us out. With the incident in the Bronx with the space heaters causing so many deaths, governemtn workers are even more strict about displacing people who have no heat, because if they know about a house that has no heat, and still dont kick the people out, if the people die, the workers will be blamed and lose their job. The whole situation just feels like its going against us. This house was 1500 and even then, my dad couldn\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s why the landlord couldn\u2019t make repairs to the house and provide heat and stove gas.\n\nI honestly have no clue how I managed to go through high school and college under these conditions. I graduated with honors in high school, but I know I could have been close to valedictorian if I lived under better conditions. Even in college, I have a 3.4 gpa rn and I\u2019m so sad about that, because my dream since I was young was to go to med school. And I know FOR A FACT, that if I was some rich white kid in Long Island, my gpa would have been so much higher. Theres so much wasted potential. I feel like I\u2019m at my happiest when I\u2019m helping others and I\u2019ve been volunteering to help others for a while now, but there never seems to be any help for me. I always thought about how there was so much irony in the fact that I was giving food to the poor through food pantries, and sometimes I myself had nothing to eat when I got home. It\u2019s not only that I didn\u2019t have anything to eat, but also that I had nothing to cook it on (landlord couldn\u2019t pay gas bill for many years so it got cut off). Lived in that house for 7 years, but I feel like I wasn\u2019t living much. I barely had food or hot water for showers. Many mornings in the winter, I would turn on the shower, and just cry while scrubbing my body with soap quickly because the water was so cold but I couldn\u2019t go to school dirty either. I didn\u2019t have space for a bed (I turned the dining room into a \u201cbedroom\u201d but couldn\u2019t fit a bed. I slept on like this beach chair thingie, because it\u2019s foldable and compact, in Urdu it\u2019s called a \u201cchar pai.\u201d I fold it back up when I wake up so that there is space to walk. I always just felt tired, I guess because I wasn\u2019t getting the nutrients I needed. I passed out twice from a combination of stress, exhaustion, lack of food, lack of sleep from it being too cold at night, etc. Passed out once on the lirr train, and once in the doctor\u2019s office I was volunteering at. But still having a roof over my head, even a bad one, is better than nothing, and I\u2019m realizing it now. I\u2019m a full time student and I have no idea how my health would turn out if I exhausted myself even further with a job. My two cats seem to be enjoying themselves in the car rn, but obviously they shouldn\u2019t be living in a car. My older sister (25 years old) is supposed to get a job in June. But honestly, with my sister\u2019s lifestyle and health (smokes a lot of weed and drinks and has mental issues that she refuses to address and passes out even more than me) idk how she will hold a job. She hasn\u2019t been able to hold one in the past. She has a lot of trauma. She has been abused by many men since she was 12, one of those men being my old landlord. I guess since he was not getting a lot fo rent from my parents, he just started sexually assaulting my sister. At some point, he was trying to groom me as well (i was 17 at the time), but I was not sure at the time, because i was so confused. Thankfully I told a school staff person and she confirmed that he was grooming me to use me like he was abusing my sister. Now that my confusion was cleared, the next time he came to my house \"to talk\" to me (idky he would have any business in \"talking\" with a teen), i simply told him, \"i am only going to talk to you if you have something to say about rent. i know what you have been doing to my sister and it makes me uncomfortable when you bring up topics about falling in love and other inappropriate subjects and touch me and get closer to me every time i step back for personal space. last time we talked, you were touching me a little bit and im not letting that continue or escalate. if you want to talk, im only going to listen if its about rent.\" He replied \"i never did anything to you\" (notice he didnt deny anything about my sister) and i said \"you know what you are doing.\" after that, he left, without talking about any rent related topic. but i wrote a diary entry about the whole incident and my older sister found it. my older sister then asked me about it, and i said what happened and she told my mom. my mom demanded that the landlord only come home when my dad is home. nothing happened to me after that, but i still believe he touches my sister. tbh, at this point, i think my landlord and sister have a relationship where he abuses her and she uses him for stuff too (like car rides to the city, or letting us stay in the house longer without paying rent, etc.) probably because she knows he will not leave her alone. he would literally be watching her through her window even after my mom demanded he stay out of the house whenever my dad isnt home. i hate to phrase it like this but she is probably making the best of the situation. at some point he also punched my mom for yelling at him to turn on the gas stove since he was getting rent at the time. the police came and they didnt file any report and said \"if we file a report, you will be kicked out.\" i know my sister should also report the sexual assaults but i dont think she wants to go through that court process. she has ptsd from being around police and jails and courts and law people. whenever i bring up her past, even in the most gentle way, she gets very irritated and angry.\n\ni honestly dont even know why im writing this anymore. im a physics major and sociology minor. it makes me angry how this whole system is made to punish the poor who are already suffering enough from just being poor. like its not my fault that im poor. and the government workers are so unsympathetic and just horrible human beings. when the sanitation workers came in the house, it was actually the landlord who let them in (idk if he did it on purpose or not, but the sanitation workers are not allowed to come in if you dont let them. so i wouldnt be homeless if my landlord didnt let them in) and when they came in, they saw everything. my sister tried talking to them and the guy was just laughing and saying how the landlord let him in. it was like he was mocking our stupid decision for letting him in. later, i told another worker that i'll throw out the space heaters right in front of him but to let us stay in the house, and again he let out a little chuckle. like wow. YOU ARE MAKING PEOPLE HOMELESS. HOW CAN YOU BE SO INSENSITIVE??? it bothers me even more that this happens to people all. the. time. these same workers are making so many other homeless, and then they go home and sip on a cup of tea about how they had a good work day. the social services department also has many rude workers. i was crying the whole time. yk how we talk about how there should be mental health counselors coming to the scene to handle some crises when 911 is called, in order to lower the amount of police brutality faced by innocent people? i feel like there should be something like that for these departments because they were simply heartless and insensitive. when people are homeless, they dont need workers yelling at them and telling them to fill out pages and pages of paperwork. sure, we will fill out the paperwork obviously because we need the services, but just be a human being. this is what im saying. poor people suffer because they are poor, but they suffer even more because of how people treat them for being poor.\n\nbeing poor brings its trauma. being brown in a white country brings its trauma. being muslim in a christian country brings its trauma. being a woman in a patriarchal society brings its trauma. i was also evicted once when i was 13, i was so depressed, had trust issues, social anxiety, woke up screaming and crying from nightmares, developed separation anxiety because i always felt like something would be taken away from me at any second. this recent incident is like picking at the scab from the older eviction incident. being poor is filled with trauma. dont people already know this? why are people still mean after knowing this? i hope to god that i do not ever turn into one of those people. i hope when i become a doctor, i treat all my patients with respect and dignity to the best of my ability because if i dont, i dont know how my conscience would let me sleep at night. i have no idea what to do rn. after may 2nd, i will be homeless (i guess im homeless rn too but living in temporary housing). my parents dont make enough for landlords to want to rent to us, even with my mom's stellar credit score. the worst part about this is my dad is trying his absolute best, despite having diabetes and being underweight from stress and lack of food and diabetes, but it still wont be enough. i hate to see him disappointed in himself, i know even rn he believes he has failed in life and has failed his family. my dad is 63 and still working so hard to provide. he cries all the time. all his other paki friends have landed up very rich.\n\nwe have hit rock bottom. i never thought i would have to ask these questions but now i have to. how does someone actually live as a homeless person? are there any insider tips? have you or anyone you have know still manage to go to college as a homeless youth? i do not plan on giving up on college until my body actually gives out. college is the only thing that will help my future and i refuse to give up until i actually die. i feel like i might die either way. also, college is the only \"normal\" part of my day rn. in a way, it keeps me sane, and keeps me from harming myself. i also have a history of self harm and attempts at suicide. before i left the house, i grabbed ibuprofen pills before i was kicked out in case i really wanted to end myself by overdosing. thankfully, i am not suicidal rn. i think i am kinda just in shock. i think i am kinda self-harming by starving myself but at the same time, from a lot of therapy talks, eventually a little voice in my head tells me that i deserve to eat despite the circumstances. so i think im fine for now. my little acts or time periods of self harm eventually end with the little voice telling me to stop harming myself. maybe after the shock ends, the real depression will kick in. i hope not. what should the rest of my family do to survive? is it possible to not be sexually assaulted as a woman on the streets? what precautions should we take? where can someone sleep safely at night, other than a shelter? if you cant give any advice, thats okay. i appreciate you taking the time to listen. &lt;3 also im very scared about how i just exposed very private details of my life so i may delete this soon.",

You may also want to let professors know as you might get a reprieve since it really is difficult to do well when you are facing real, immediate personal crises. You can also just DM me if you want to vent. DO reach out to counseling at HC as well...I know it isn't shelter, but it may help with the ideation and hopelessness. Be well.",

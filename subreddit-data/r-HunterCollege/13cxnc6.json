Yes, it's mostly a business school, but that's why it's great for science. There aren't many science majors and so the science faculty really treasure them and support them and have a great record of getting them into health-related grad schools.",

            "comment": "I am a dental student that graduated from Hunter. Hunter was literally the worst college choice I made. I got baited by their \u201cstellar track record of getting students to become doctors, dentists, etc.\u201d The secret behind that stellar track record is they have **extremely** tough weed out pre-req courses and if you don\u2019t do well, like get above a 3.6, then they don\u2019t endorse you and literally won\u2019t give you any support (write a committee letter) so you technically aren\u2019t part of their stats. \n\nHunter is bad for premeds, and even worse for predents. Unlike premeds, predent students actually need to take a bunch of pre-reqs to apply to dental school outside of the general prereqs, and a majority of dental schools require a committee letter. So if you go to Hunter, you will have to go through all the BS that you might not have to do as premed. Although I did really well in anatomy, you really don\u2019t want to take that class at Hunter. Genetics with Feinstein also is a shitshow, and honestly, their whole biology major is ass. Screw Hunter. Science school my ass. \n\nGet out of Hunter and go to literally any other CUNY. I went to Brooklyn for ePermit (I hear that\u2019s not a thing anymore though) and the classes were way easier but still challenging enough to get you to learn. Baruch is an option too, but I personally haven\u2019t tried any classes there, although I really like Baruchs campus.",

You could try to epermit, it\u2019ll allow you to possibly take a certain class at another CUNY. But overall, it\u2019s up to you. Hope everything works out!",

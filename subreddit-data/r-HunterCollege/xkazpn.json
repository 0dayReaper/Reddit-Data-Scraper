When I was a freshman, that flr had much more space for students to sit &amp; do work instead of the tiny/limited spaces they have now. It used to look like the 2nd flr with plenty of huge tables for students. That'd be enough space for yourself &amp; someone across the table, even if both put their book bags on the table, with laptops, books/notes, thermos/drinks, pencil cases, calculators, etc. &amp; it wouldn't be a problem. This is amount of space students should have. For the 7th flr library, there's basically nowhere to sit. Most, if not half that 7th flr is reserved for tutoring. And 6th flr space is also slashed in half. There's that area in the back that would closed sometimes \ud83e\udd37. This flr also used to look like the 2nd flr in my freshman year I think. I'd trade these bright colors / limited space for the huge tables we used to have any day. The colors now are nice and bright, be it east or west building (near the escalators), but I don't get the many sofas, who wants to write / do work on their laps? For me at least. (But I actually see students take real naps on it. Which makes me happy for them. Been there, I know how hard student life can be. However at the same time, cuz my point is lack of space, it takes up the entire couch.)\n\nWhen I was in school, sometimes they be renting out spaces, like the cafeteria (I'm assuming they rented out the space unless they just offered this space freely??), for other events not related to us when there was already not enough spaces for students to eat/sit.\n\nBesides space, sucks there's no cafeteria now for food. There's already not many options nearby unless you go all the way to 1st Ave.\n\n\nOtherwise I liked Hunter \ud83d\ude0a still do.",

Good luck making friends who are as studious as you because tbh, a lot of the people do not care about school. Most of the pre med people switch majors because they realize they aren\u2019t cut out for it. The culture is nonexistent. What more needs to be said. I\u2019ve talked to people who did pre med at hunter and they regretted going. Oh and btw, most of pre med acceptances did gap years, so don\u2019t expect to get in right away. Try to avoid it, but if you do go, good luck. \n\nEdit: There is only one section for a lot of lectures at the school. There is only one time for it so you lack freedom in scheduling.",

The stats on their website are only for those who received the committee letter which is the very top handful of the premed population at Hunter. Majority of the students get weeded out of even being able to apply for the committee letter (such as by not meeting the minimum MCAT score, not taking the MCAT by their desired date, not attending all the PPAP meetings, not getting enough course evals or letter of reccs, etc etc). Thus, most people end up getting a letter packet instead though they don\u2019t post the stats for how many ppl get into med school with solely just the letter packet. And yea it makes sense that ~95% of the students who get the committee letter end up getting into med school just cause the requirements would inevitably make u a very strong applicant for med school. So as the other ppl said it\u2019s a *very* tedious and stressful process but yea it does produce results for those who make it through and are lucky especially (like if your someone who\u2019s a transfer student or decides to become premed later on like your sophomore year, the process to get that committee letter just gets harder and harder to go thru)",

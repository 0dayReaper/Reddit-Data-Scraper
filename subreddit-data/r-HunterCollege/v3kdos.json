Then make you go to Schedule builder on cuny first and they just talked about how it works and they were there to assist us if we had questions about our schedules. If you have a hold on your account for academic advising they will get rid of it aswell or any other holds. That was it really nothing else",

How exactly did you do it? Judging by other comments i think it\u2019s safe to say I missed the first registration. But what about the orientation? Student forms website doesn\u2019t work for me. Do i go to the school?",

For registration all they talked about was how to use schedule builder. And help you change your schedule around if you don\u2019t like what time slot you got. The only thing you can\u2019t change is the professor you got.",

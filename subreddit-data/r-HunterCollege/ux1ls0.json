But after I am guided by school and got me started, I can learn myself afterward with other sources suvh as youtube and so on. CS is a totally new subject to me.",

He never even heard of CS like me. But after he started school and can't learn it himself. He started school and learn it their. He pass most of his CS courses with mostly A's and got his masters at Cornell. After he learned he understand how to search up things. Now working at Google. He told me sometime some people just need guidance because they never exposed to certain background and some just learn it themselves because they know what is that subject about. I am confident I can be like him. That is why I ask which school is better to guide me.",

Your friend is a huge outlier. Learn what CS is, go to an Ivy leagues website and look at their courses/curriculum and look at their literal free courses that they put on Youtube. The entire courses are on youtube.  I gave you a website to start programming. Get the book \"Learn Python the Hard Way\" and start it. Take some ownership of yourself.",

We just learned the last few month before finishing senior year.\nI appreciate for the advise for learning, books, and the website.

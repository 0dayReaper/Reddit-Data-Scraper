Plus the grading is lenient.\n\nWhen I took 127, all your low hw and quiz grades get replaced by your final. It is very possible to get an A in the class by only taking the Final exam and replacing your missing grades with the grade you receive on the final. And the final isn't anything unexpected, so as long as you pay attention in class, you should do well.",

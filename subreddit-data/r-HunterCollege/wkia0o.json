    "postText": "For MATH 10100 it says I need to purchase a college algebra (OHM bundle) book. I've heard that sometimes professors don't actually require/use certain books, or they want you to buy different books. Should I purchase it now, or wait until class starts to see if I actually need it? Or is it possible to find this book online for free? It's only $32, so I don't mind paying for it. Just not sure if I should wait, or buy it now.",

            "comment": "Never buy anything before the semester starts. Wait for the prof to post the class syllabus cus that's the most updated version of what they want you to have. You can use zlibrary to find pdfs of books you need in the meanwhile. Also, some courses require access codes (including most math classes) for that situation there's no way to avoid purchasing some form of the book because the access code lets you access homework, classwork, and/or exams online. In your case, I believe that's what the OHM bundle is. Also never purchase books from the Hunter bookstore because they are more expensive than the original website.",

    "postText": "So I've recently been accepted to Hunter as a transfer student and am planning to pursue a major in Chemistry. I was wondering what the opportunities are like for getting research/internship/fellowship opportunities in the chemistry department? I've heard that the science classes can be very crowded so I'm worried that it would be hard for me to connect with a professor, making these opportunities very competitive. Please let me know if you have any experience with this, it would help me decide whether to enroll at Hunter. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Subreddit is now public again. But due to our protest being met with silence and internal [ridicule](https://files.catbox.moe/a4l0kg.png) this subreddit has planned to go **Read-Only** every **Tuesday and Thursday**. We are not able to go dark (a.k.a private) indefinitely due it being a student resource but [many other large/small subreddits will](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/). The Read-Only days will called **Touch Grass Tuesday/Thursday** and subreddit will be automically put into Read-Only mode during those days and reverted afterwards. I implore you guys to either move to our [off-Reddit instance](https://hc.frorayz.tech/) or use our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3TrGtqu) more. ***Do no give Reddit more traffic and ad revenue***. Thank you!",

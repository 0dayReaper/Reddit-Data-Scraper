With P/NC, you get a pass if you get a letter grade of either A, B, C, or D and NC if you get an f.",

I searched it up online and it took me to fill out a form, however I heard elsewhere that I\u2019m also required to get the professor\u2019s signature? Is this true? Or can I just submit the form and that is enough?",

Where do I get said form?   \n\n\nI know Im failing, but what if she was going to give me a C- or a D, should I just take it for the sake of completing the credit requirements?",

If you end up w a NC it would be the same result as the W anyways, u would have to retake the class.",

(I'm a lower sophomore at Hunter)\n\n**If anyone is doing basic CS classes in the Spring 23 semester like the ones listed below and wants to study together, please let me know. I don't want to socially isolate myself studying CS (ya know the stereotypes) so I just thought I'd ask on here.**\n\nMy classes:\n\nUNIX programming 13200\n\nIntro to CS",

I was wondering if I should take it if its mandatory? I know i must take language classes as requirement for graduating but I thought I was suppose to choose which language I was any to take during orientation where I can make my schedule and classes. Any advice on it?",

For ex if you pass the placement exam you can choose a minor or concentration to complete instead. But for easy As i would recommend sticking w language classes from beginner level. \n\nAlso, first sem freshmens will not be making their own schedule. You will just pick out of the schedules already made based on your learning community and most of them dont have lang. my friends and i started our lang req sophomore year bc of that",

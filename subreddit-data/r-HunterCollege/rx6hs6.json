    "postText": "So I got an email telling me that I have to submit the Booster Shot Vaccination online by Jan 18. Why would they mandate this on such short notice like I\u2019m just hearing about it. I would\u2019ve rather taken it earlier in the months, and not now since I am with family and don\u2019t wanna get sick around them.\nCan anyone please confirm if this email only pertains to the BOOSTER shot or is it just talking about the regular COVID shots? \nIf so I\u2019ve already taken both doses of Pfizer and uploaded and it\u2019s been approved etc.",

Throughout the email it says \u201cWe will soon share details of the process for students to provide proof of booster vaccination, along with the deadlines for doing so.\u201d So i do not think there is a set deadline for the booster yet. However if you are eligible to get the booster, i would get it as soon as you are able too.",

    "postText": "We\u2019re looking for someone to pick up our chatty, affectionate, energetic 2.75 year old son at his school on the UES at 3:00 on weekdays, keep him entertained till 5/5:30, and bring him home a few blocks away, starting next week. Willing to split between two people. Additional availability for days off school would be great, but is not required. Let me know if you or someone you can recommend is interested. Prior babysitting experience strongly preferred.",

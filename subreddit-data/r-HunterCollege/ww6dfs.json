    "postText": "I\u2019ve been teaching preschool at a private school for the past few years and am now in grad school at Hunter. In order to complete the program I need to do two student teaching classes. I can only do one at my job site but I have to do the other one at a placement by the school. \n\nThis would all be fine typically, however, because I have to be out of the classroom for student teaching once a week, my employer says they can\u2019t keep me on. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has had this experience and if so, what did you do? I\u2019ve been trying to apply to jobs but when I tell them I will be gone one day a week for the fall semester due to student teaching, they aren\u2019t as inclined to give me an offer. \n\nI\u2019m feeling a bit helpless so any guidance/suggestions on this are much appreciated! \n\nThank you in advance!",

    "postText": "Im majoring in CS and my next set of classes that I\u2019m planning on taking for spring is CSCI 135, CSCI 150, and MATH 150. I heard that CSCI 150 paired with a math class is difficult. So I don\u2019t want to take many classes. So I can put more of my time into those classes studying. So I was wondering if Hunter offers Writing intensive classes like ENGL 22000 in the summer? Cause if they do I will have 15 credits in total and be on track to graduate in 4 years. My registration date is 11/17",

Make sure to take time off regularly from studying as studying all day won\u2019t make it stick. Have a structure and plan for all your classes and destress! Meditation, hanging out with friends etc. whatever you can do to take things off a bit. Good luck!",

I think online school makes it a bit easier to do well academically too, But I just miss and crave that routine of life we had before coronavirus. Is your concern about the virus? There\u2019s uncertainty going into every semester and my hope this one will resemble the semesters that existed before all this. I feel safe being vaccinated, properly wearing a mask. I always respect that everyone comes from a unique position though and I Wish you well",

I\u2019m a student journalist looking to do a story about how Hunter students are coping with the stress of being in person and ways in which Hunter can help alleviate that stress. Would you be interested in chatting about your experience being back in school thus far and what you think would help make your time on campus better?",

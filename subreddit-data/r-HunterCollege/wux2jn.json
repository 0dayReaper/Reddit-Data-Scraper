    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshmen at Hunter, Class of 2026. Right now I have a M1 MacBook Air and I was thinking about switching over to a cellular M1 iPad Air for classes. I would get the iPad Air with a magic keyboard and an Apple Pencil as well. I was just wondering which one would be better to have for classes, as I was thinking about selling my MacBook Air to finance my new iPad, so the iPad would be my all-in-one machine. Does Blackboard and other CUNY stuff still work with the iPad, and which one is better to have on-campus for classes? Also are there certain apps that may work on the Mac but not on the iPad? \n\n(Chemistry Major btw)",

            "comment": "I think having an ipad would be great for stem majors. There is a lot of annotation done for notes and for like chem there are compounds you need to draw. However, the newly upgraded cunyfirst doesn't fully work on mobile. For ex, schedule builder doesn't open, and neither does any of the pop-ups like if you request for an unofficial transcript. It's best you have access to a computer whether it's the school or one at home. But in terms of taking notes, an iPad would be great. If you do get an iPad look into investing in GoodNotes 5 or Notability. I personally prefer GoodNotes 5 more but there's one feature on notability I love which is the recording lec feature",

    "postText": "I'm a senior in college looking to apply to Hunter's GSE for teaching social studies. I am nervous about the application requirements regarding a world history course and am wondering if there are any current students with advice? I have not taken a course that's specifically world history in college, but I do have AP credit from AP world history listed on my official transcript. Would those credits fulfill that application requirement?",

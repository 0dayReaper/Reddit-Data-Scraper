    "postText": "Hi! Transfer student starting tomorrow, I wandered around the West &amp; North buildings today to get an idea of where my classes will be and what\u2019s inside. Not gonna lie, it\u2019s pretty confusing and I got lost more than once. \nIt seems like the Hunter website only has street maps of where the buildings are, but nothing mapping the rooms/floors/facilities. Is there anything like this out there? Does anyone have pieces of advice they\u2019ve gathered as a student? (Where to find study rooms, libraries, all the sky bridges, all the elevators/escalators/stairs, just an idea of where everything is). Thank you!",

            "comment": "there is no map of the buildings inside. you will just have to locate your classes and just remember where they are. as for library the main library is in the east building with entrances on level 3 and 7. study rooms need to be reserved beforehand (up to 2 weeks before). there are only 2 sky bridges that connect east and west building which are floors 3/7. north and west are only connected at 3F. if you need to find the a certain office just google it and their dept site will pop up w room numb/email/phone #.",

            "comment": "Piece of advice as a junior, don't wait for elevators unless you absolutely have to. They take forever and they're always packed. Take the stairs. Idk much about the library, sorry, but I'll tell you what i do know. \n\nAll of the hunter buildings are connected somehow so you don't even have to go outside if you don't want to. \n\nThe North, West, and library buildings are connected by sky bridges on the third floor. The Thomas hunter hall building is connected directly to the north building via the third floor as well (when you take the sky bridge to the north building, take an immediate right, down the steps towards the game room/wooden stair seats, you are now inside Thomas hunter hall. Going left takes you to the north building.) \n\nThe first letter before a class number is the building it's in (N421 would be in the north building, W415 would be in the west building, TH301 would be in thomas hunter hall)\n\nThe only building that has escalators for more than one floor is the west building(from the 1st floor to more than the 7th floor, idk exactly how many.)\n\nThere is a direct passage from the 6 train into the west building. It's very obvious and towards the right when you get out to where the turnstiles are. You'll need to scan your Hunter ID to get in.\n\nThe elevators for the north building are fairly obvious to find because they're right in the middle of the building. \n\nThomas hunter hall has 2 elevators one is express and the other isn't. One goes up no farther than the 5th floor while the other goes beyond that. They are also found in the middle of the building.\n\nHunter west has 2 to 4 elevators depending on what floor you are on. To get to them you have to go past the vending machines and the bathrooms(always follow those paths and you'll find them.)\n\nThe advisement office (West building 4th floor) or any other important office, all have a slip of paper that has the location of important rooms in all of the buildings. The slip of paper is easily noticeable because they're rectangular shaped(if put on the long side) and a bright color(green,pink,orange,blue etc.)\n\nIf you have any questions lmk!",

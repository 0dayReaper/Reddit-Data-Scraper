The F will just remain on your transcript.   \nIf you got a D or higher the first time and retake it got higher, both grades will be accounted for in GPA.   \nIf you got a D or higher you will need to fill out the course repeat request form.   \nhttps://hunter-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/policies-and-requirements/academic-requirements/course-policies/repeating-courses",

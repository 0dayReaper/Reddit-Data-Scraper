    "postText": "As we all know colleges have a lot of issues. One of the biggest issues that I have dealt with in my opinion is that we have to decide our classes and which professors to take with little or no information. Another issue is that professors don\u2019t send out their syllabus until the day of or even after the first day of classes.\n\nSo for the past couple of months, I have been working on a website to solve these issues, and in order to solve them, I need your help by submitting whatever syllabi you have collected over your time at your college and posting them onto the website I created. \n\nThis will hopefully help people decide what classes to take more carefully and classes that better suit their needs. For example, some people hate paying for Connect/Cengage or every other type of site that just steals college kids money, so you can open the syllabus and see what type of book the professor uses. Another example is that some people prefer tests, so now you can look at the syllabus and see what percentage of the course is graded on tests. I think a big piece of information many students will like to know is if attendance is graded or not. \n\nOverall, this is probably a long term solution depending on how many submissions we get, but I am hoping that it will help some of you when deciding who to pick for next semester. I hope you will share with all your friends at your college and other universities and encourage them to post on the website. \n\nAlso I wanted to mention that this is completely free, and depending on how many syllabi you have it should take less than 5 minutes. \n\nIf you do want to support me for this site, I have a contact page on the site where you can email me for information, or contact me to ask for improvements. I am not a website developer so I am kind of limited to what I can improve.  \n\n[https://findmysyllabi.com/](https://findmysyllabi.com/)\n\n[https://findmysyllabi.com/upload/](https://findmysyllabi.com/upload/)\n\nThank you to everyone who read my post, spread the word, and posted their syllabus on the site.",

Im a visual person so writing out list of stuff to do on a whiteboard made a big difference. Once you get into the rhythm of what tasks to do in what order it gets easier to manage and focus your efforts. Friends going through the same struggles helps too and can remind you of work you might forget about. Good luck u can do it!",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a transfer student that begun my first semester the previous semester that just passed. I only took one class, intro to CS, but failed. Did that really plummet my new GPA to below a 2.0 which is why I got an email regarding academic probation? \n\nI\u2019m taking 4 classes next semester so I\u2019m wondering what my GPA should approximately be if I pass with all A\u2019s",

            "comment": "Hi! Fellow transfer here. From what I remember, transfer students don\u2019t carry their GPA from the last institution to the new one. So you\u2019re essentially starting from a blank slate in your new school. If you only took one class in your first semester since transferring, that class is going to have a huge impact on your GPA. As it is your only source of grades so far. This would explain your current situation. It would be different if you took other classes and passed them while taking intro to CS.\n\nIf you want to get an idea of what your GPA is going to look like after taking other courses, you can use DegreeWork\u2019s term calculator. It\u2019ll help you get an idea of what your GPA will look like after taking additional courses. You\u2019ll have to input the grades you\u2019re expecting to get to generate your potential GPA.",

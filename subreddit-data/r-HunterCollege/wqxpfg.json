    "postText": "I need some help with the hunter bookstore. Not in terms of paying for the book, but just with a bit of confusion that comes with it. When I buy an e-book on the website, does it automatically come in your email in like a file or something? I only ever bought ebooks from google play and even then I haven't done it in a long time. Also one of my books says access code only at the end. Does that mean that it'll only give the code and not the book or does that mean that I only need the access code for the actual classwork? I'm a freshman so this is all still very new to me.",

            "comment": "Dont buy anything from hunter bookstore website bc everything is always more expensive on there. Also if it says access code you can go onto the textbooks site. Access code means you will be able to access classwork /or homework on there. If you buy an access code from hunter bookstore they send you a code that you type into the website - buy from actual site and it\u2019s cheaper. Also do not buy anythjng before the semester starts however you will 99% have to buy the access code textbooks.",

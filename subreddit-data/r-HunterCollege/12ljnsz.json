    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m potentially transferring in to Hunter from the midwest as a junior. I\u2019m worried since Hunter is a commuter school and not a very social school that it will be hard to make friends coming in so late and being from out of state. Also how bad is the housing since I hear not great thing about it. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to school in NYC but Hunter worries me a little. Thanks for any help!",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI have one full semester left at Hunter. A class I needed to take in order to graduate with honors was cancelled and replaced with a much less interesting course that I would rather not take. My department offers a single honors course, a different one every semester.\n\nI'd like to wait until the Spring and try my luck with whatever Honors course is offered then. But seeing as how I'm currently registered for 3 classes (and need one more to remain full-time), is it possible to take a course outside of the requirements of my degree to maintain full-time status? \n\nHas anyone done this before? How does is affect financial aid?\n\nThanks!",

And for them even tho they have 12+ credits enrolled because there are only 3 courses being applied to their major req TAP denied them full time student status. If you get TAP and looking to be enrolled for full time status then you'll have to take a course that would be applied to your major.",

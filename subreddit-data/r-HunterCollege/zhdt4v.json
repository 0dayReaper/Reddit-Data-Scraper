    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI'm wondering if there's any need for free math tutoring at Hunter. Are existing tutors good? Is there a lack of them? Do you know anyone in need of some tutoring?  \n\n\nI work as a research mathematician, but I miss tutoring and the feeling of helping others. I'm on an immigrant visa, though, and I can't take any paid positions as a math tutor. I live near Hunter college and figure I could just go to the math department and talk to someone -- is there any particular place where math students gather to work on problem sets?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck with finals.",

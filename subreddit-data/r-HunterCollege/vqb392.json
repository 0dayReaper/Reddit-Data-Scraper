    "postText": "okay! this might seem like a dumb question, but, i was trying to sign up for intro to cs and it says that it\u2019s for daedalus students only! i\u2019m a chem transfer student and never applied/got into that honors program. my question is can i apply to daedalus as a hunter student or was it one of those honors program that you could only get into as an incoming freshman? also, say i don\u2019t apply, do i need to be in that honors program to major in cs? or take cs classes? i\u2019m totally lost when it comes to signing up for cs classes since i\u2019ve been so focused on chem/science classes!! i would really appreciate your guys help!!! thank you &lt;3",

On my end I\u2019m seeing CSCI 12700: Intro to comp science as open, this is the one under Section 01-LEC. The others have an EC (early college) and HC (Honors) so you wouldn\u2019t be able to register for them.",

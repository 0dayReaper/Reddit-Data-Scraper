That\u2019s what mine was anyway. They also ask some general scenario questions. \u201cWhen have you had to confront a coworker about something\u201d \u201ctalk about a time you\u2019ve made a mistake\u201d that sort of thing. I recommend jumping in there and trying to a answer at least one or two because there\u2019s a lot of people and I know like half the people in my interview didn\u2019t participate at all and likely didn\u2019t get it. It\u2019s mostly a career skills development program so they focus on that sort of thing a lot.",

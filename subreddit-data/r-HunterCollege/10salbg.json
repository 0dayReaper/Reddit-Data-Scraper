    "postText": "Hi, Im a freshman in the spring semester and had a few questions.\n1. Whats a good raw score that would get you into the 99th percentile?\n2. My intended major got messed up so I am undeclared, further meaning hunter never setup the classes for me for pre-reqs. But I got lucky and took AP CHEM and AP PSYCH in highschool and got 5\u2019s on both. That being said, I have a 3.9 GPA right now and the only 2 pre-req completes I have are stat (took in the winter) and english. Will that 3.9 GPA still be weighed the same as a student who had the normal path of taking their correct pre-reqs during the fall? \n3. I turned in my Nursing application a few days before deadline and they said after I turned in that they might take a few weeks to give it to Hunter, so am I screwed? \n4. What is the average scores of both GPA and PAX that tend to get into the program?\n\nThanks to whoever comes across this and replies.",

            "comment": "Hi,\n\n1. Average PAX exam for Hunter has always been around 140. So you should aim for 140 or higher. \n\n2. I\u2019m pretty sure the GPA should be weighted the same. However, I don\u2019t think AP Chem is equivalent to Chem 100/101 at Hunter (rather it\u2019s equivalent to Chem 102/103 LAB *edited*) but check DegreeWorks.\nThe pre-reqs for nursing are: Chem 100/101, Engl 120, Stat 113, Psych 100, Chem 120/121, Psych 150, and Engl 220 (not a pre-req, but fulfills WI and English Comp 2).\n\n3. I don\u2019t think so. Check the status. If it says it\u2019s complete, I\u2019m sure they received it. Some students, like myself, submit it a day before the deadline.\n\n4. The average PAX is 140, and GPA minimum requirement is 3.2; however, acceptance into the program has an average GPA of 3.5.\n\nI hope these information are helpful, and good luck!",

I\u2019m not sure if Chem 102/103 would make it more appealing or less appealing. However, if you reached out and they say 102/103 could be accepted, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter about if it\u2019s more or less appealing \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

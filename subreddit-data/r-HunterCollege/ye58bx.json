    "postText": "I've been enjoying studying for long hours recently but I really can't find the time to fit in a meal. Eating generally feels like a hassle most of the time. I can't get back into the zone after I stop studying and go start eating. I tried just coffee once but that lead to heart palpitations, a pit feeling in my stomach, and many trips to the bathroom.\n\n I'm really curious during a studying session (5 or more hours) what do you guys eat to help you keep going? Fasting has been kinda working for me but I get headaches once I'm done. \n\nPlease share your routine and what normally works for you. I'm assuming it's different for everyone.",

It isn\u2019t the greatest thing to not eat, it\u2019ll catch up with you eventually. Stick to high protein with lots of greens on the side. I\u2019m not gonna tell you to go low carb because I don\u2019t want to promote any misleading diet culture bullshit buuut personally, the sugars in simple carbs really make me sleepy as fuck, so try to stick to complex carbs. Good luck!",

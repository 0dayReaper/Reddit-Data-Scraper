    "postText": "Hello everyone, how is break treating you so far? I\u2019m here today b/c it is more than likely I will be getting a C+ in my JPN202 class. This wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it weren\u2019t for the fact that I have declared my minor in Japanese, and need at least a B- to pass so it counts towards my minor. I was wondering if I can retake it for the minor, but I\u2019m not too sure. Just wanted to see if anyone has had something similar happen and knows what to do. Thank you!",

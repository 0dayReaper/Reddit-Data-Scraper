    "postText": "i epermitted bio 1 at BMCC and got a B (when taking bio at hunter i realized there was no way i was passing), and i am planning on epermitting bio 2 as well. a recent problem arose: i finished with a D in orgo 1 this semester and hunter's orgo classes are only available seasonly so id have to wait til next year to retake, and i just cant make the time :( the last thing i want to do is graduate late and my parents also dont know about my situation so im trying to look as composed as possible. i guess my question is, will i be ok epermitting these science courses when my goal is to graduate into PA school (or clinical psychology school, or nursing, also undecided which doesnt help). its just hard since hunter is so harsh with their pre health students so i feel like me epermitting looks terrible and theres not much hope for me. any advice or personal stories more than welcome :)",

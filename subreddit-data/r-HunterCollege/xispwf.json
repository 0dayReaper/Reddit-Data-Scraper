It\u2019s been almost 2 weeks since I sent my application. How did everybody else get internet on there gaming systems at Brookdale? They said they would email me and I haven\u2019t gotten anything from them on my school email. I also Can\u2019t try to send the application again since is won\u2019t allow you to send an application with the same MAC address twice. I have already gone to the IT help desk in person and they said I should receive an email from the network team soon. That was last week tho\ud83d\udc80. Do I just wait forever or is there something else people are doing?",

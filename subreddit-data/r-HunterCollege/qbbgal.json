            "comment": "I don't think so because like you said, it is not a prerequisite. Since it is a difficult class, it will most likely affect your gpa. However, it would be best to get the class over with sooner than later. If you do choose to withdraw from the class, you will have to take the class again anyway when you get into the program, which could be annoying.\n\nFYI: once you are in the nursing program, you are not allowed to e-permit your classes, which sucks because A&amp;P at Hunter is terrible.\n\nAs stated on the [Hunter nursing website](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/nursing/admissions/undergraduate/bachelor-of-science-nursing-program): \"Students matriculated in the nursing program are not allowed to take any courses by e-permit. All courses must be taken at Hunter College.\"",

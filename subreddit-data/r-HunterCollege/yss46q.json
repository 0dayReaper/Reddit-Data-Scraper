    "postText": "I'm not entirely sure about you all, but in my experience, 2 out of 3 of the water fountains I go to both in the west building and the north building, Don't fucking work! and when they do work, they only dispense so little, why?! I feel like the school does so on purpose just to get the students to buy water bottles from the vending machines instead, which is probably why several floors in the west building have vending machines not too far away from the water fountains. I just want the school to fix the water fountains so that they work properly. Let me know if any of you had experienced the same thing as well.",

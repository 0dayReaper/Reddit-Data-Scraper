    "postText": "I want to change my academic advisor to someone better that actually guides me through college and helps me with my questions. My current advisor never replies to my emails nor ever gets on with zoom meetings as I live pretty far from college. Even when with some chance she is online for the meeting, she always talks with me with an attitude like I\u2019m an idiot and supposed to know the answers to the questions I\u2019m trying to ask.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm going to be traveling and I'm unable to rebook the flight so I don't miss the first class on Wednesday the 31st. It's from 4pm - 6:30pm in the North Building. I'm willing to pay someone if you could just sit in the class (preferably near the front) and just record the audio on your phone please! Bonus points if you can take a picture of what's on the board now and then.\n\nThen if you can email me afterwards that would be amazing so I can least review it while I'm gone. It'd be a big help and I really appreciate it.\n\nI can pay $26 an hour for this, so that's $130 total. Please let me know if that's something you're available to do, if not please pass it along to a friend or someone else who might be available at that time who's currently attending the fall semester. Thank you!\n\nI already spoke to the professor about it by the way and he's ok with it. Thank you so much!\n\nEdit: may be trying a different option now!\nEdit Edit: That fell through! So still open although I'm messaging with some people now.",

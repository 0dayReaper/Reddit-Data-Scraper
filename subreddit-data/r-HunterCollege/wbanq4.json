    "postText": "As a nursing major, I am planning to MINOR in Psychology. My nursing schedule is a total of 8.5 credits. I took an additional Psych class and a Sociology class to remain full time at 14.5 credits. \n\nI hear from my peers that the reason my TAP went down is because I am taking psychology and sociology class which does align with the Nursing curriculum.\n\nHow accurate is this? \n\nI took this class because I am basically done with all my core requirements except one. I plan to do the remaining core in winter. I took these classes so I can remain a full-time student and get my fafsa.\n\nSo, how would I solve this? Drop Psych and Soc? Is that even the problem? Anyone else go through this w their majors?",

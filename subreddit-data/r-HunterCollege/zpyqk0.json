Typically to remain a full time student for fin aid and still be on track for 4 year graduation you can take 4-6 classes. Just keep in mind the limit per fall/spring semester is 17.5 credits. Anything over 17.5 requires an overload form filled out. You can retake the class whenever for a better grade, not just next semester.",

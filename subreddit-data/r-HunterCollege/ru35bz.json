Do you think I can cram all the info in less than a month? Like do they ask for something specific of the human body etc",

Just don\u2019t even apply to the program if you think you can cram an exam that\u2019s literally due by the end of February in less than a month. Your priorities are short lived, good luck cramming in nursing school. And also, read Hunter\u2019s website which has a page on the exam.",

If you study 3-5 hours a day, you can do fine. especially if you know how you study best. practice questions are key. Some questions in the book are even on the test!! Also half of your chances of getting in are due to your grades so keep those up. you got this :)",

For example, they\u2019d ask for which of the options belongs to (blank) system, or they\u2019d ask the function of a structure. I\u2019d say to study out of the red book (NLN) because it covers all of the basics that you\u2019ll need to know. Study a few systems everyday, and hopefully you\u2019ll be more comfortable. Good luck!",

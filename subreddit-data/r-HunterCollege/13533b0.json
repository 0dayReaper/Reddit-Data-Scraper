She records herself using voice thread lectures which are super informative but understandable and the coursework is short and simple with one final project. You can definitely take it alongside 213 and it shouldn\u2019t affect anything.",

Exams and a final paper (research, 3-4 pages double spaced in length) and final exam. I def recommend. Just make sure you have a good stat 213 prof to keep the class load manageable",

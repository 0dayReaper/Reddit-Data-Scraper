    "postText": "Hi! Accepted transfer here. Was curious on what specific clubs/organizations have a log of people and are the most eventful. I would appreciate all honest takes. As well as clubs/organizations that are a buzzkill and not worth it either due to bad faculty advisors, lack of popularity or anything basically. Please let me know I would greatly appreciate it.",

            "comment": "Honestly, most, if not all, of the clubs are very low in participants. While that is sad, if you are really motivated to join a club, do it. Hunter is largely known as an introverted school, and pivoting towards that narrative by not joining clubs because of their enrollment contributes to that. Hopefully, this information helps.",

    "postText": "Thinking about transferring to Hunter College (from SUNY Binghamton) to pursue a Statistics major but I wanted to hear reviews from students themselves before making a decision. What would you say the difficulty level is (can you use calculators, do you get formula sheets, etc)? How's the math department in general? Are most of the professors effective at teaching material?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a fairly new statistics major at Hunter. The curriculum is pretty standard but the math department is VERY small. There is about one section for every class required for the major (besides calc) so if it doesn\u2019t work with your schedule it can get a bit tricky. \nAs for the difficulty, it really depends on your professors. I\u2019ve been lucky to have good professors so far but others I know have not. \n\nhttp://www.hunter.cuny.edu/advising/repository/files/degree-maps-iii/Statistics_BA_updated.pdf\n\nHere is a sample course map. You can PM me if you have any more questions.",

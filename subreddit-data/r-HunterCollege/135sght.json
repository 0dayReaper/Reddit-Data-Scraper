    "postText": "Hello I'm trying to enroll in chem 102 for the fall semester, and I got this message. I am taking calculus  over the summer. Do I need to wait until the summer semester starts in order to enroll in chemistry. Does the system work so that I not only have to be enrolled but must be currently attending the prerequisite/corequisite in order to enroll in that course the following semester or am I missing something. The section that I tried to enroll in is 9510-REC 6632-LEC. Please help, I don't the section to fill up.",

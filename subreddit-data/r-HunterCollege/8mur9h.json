Morris, journalism professor, by a source trying to help commencement students]\n\nFrom: Hunter Class of 2018 &lt;hunterclassof18@gmail.com&gt; \nDate: 5/14/18 10:51 PM (GMT-05:00) \nTo: alumniofhunter@gmail.com \nSubject: Graduation 2018 \n\nOffice of Alumni Relations and Annual Giving\nEast Building, Room 1314, Hunter College\n695 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10065\nTel: 212-396-6606\nFax: 212-772-4074\nMay 14, 2018\nTo Whom it May Concern,\nToday, just two days before graduation package pick-up, graduating seniors were informed that the graduation tickets we reserved as instructed do not exist. Only the first so many students who are available to queue up online at exactly 5pm (during which classes are in session) this Wednesday, have a chance at reserving tickets by a newly instated system after failure of the Commencement Committee to plan accordingly for our class size. \nThe celebration we have worked towards for 20+ years has been pulled out from under us and our families, and all because more students accomplished what they were enrolled to do. We were informed that, despite years of academic determination and fortitude, our participation and success in the Hunter College community will not be acknowledged.\n\nIt is not unwarranted for students and their families to uphold the expectation that graduation will be equally accessible to all those who have met the requirements, bought graduation packages, and reserved tickets on time. In fact, such abhorrent dysfunction on the part of the Hunter College administration, in being unable to facilitate an annual reception so fundamental to the college experience is inexcusable.\n\nAs a CUNY school, Hunter College serves the diverse population of New York City\u2014we are the children of those who make up the back bone of the greatest city on earth. Yet often we are the first in our family to go to college or of families battling insurmountable obstacles just to maintain the opportunity to be in school. Class of 2018 has despite all odds overcome these hardships while in school to make it to our May 30th, 2018, graduation. One may suggest that it is not easy to organize such a large event. However, this was someone\u2019s job and they failed. They don\u2019t get a pass. We did ours, and we don\u2019t get a pass when we fail at things that are hard, like Organic Chemistry, Music Theory, or Advanced Calculus.\n\nWe need all the help we can get to get our graduation back.\nSincerely,\nHunter College Class of 2018\n",

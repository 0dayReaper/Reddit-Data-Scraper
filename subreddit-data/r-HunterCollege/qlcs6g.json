    "postText": "I was a degenerate and an idiot in my high school years and I want to go above and beyond, but before I can I need to take a placement exam which I definitely will pass. It's just the placement exam is next week and enrollment starts at around November 10th. My result and the process won't be made until 2 weeks or more. Is this class the type of class to be filled quickly or is it a class that not many take as many have accelerated above and beyond since it's hunter? \n\nThank you in advance.",

Her exams are extremely comprehensive and they are soooo difficult. The final was a nightmare, more than half the class failed last semester. Her reviews on RMP are accurate. I would annotate all the readings that she assigns you, do extensive research on your part. Exams are NOT open book, you have to know the material by heart. Good luck.",

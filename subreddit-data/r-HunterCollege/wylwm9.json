    "postText": "Hi All, \n\nI graduated as a biology major/chemistry minor back in 2014 from NYU and directly worked in research since then. At this point, after some deep soul searching, I\u2019ve decided to pursue a career in medicine as a physician which means I will be applying to medical school next summer. I will be taking the MCAT in January as I\u2019ve been studying for it this summer alongside my full time job. I plan on continuing to study through the fall and winter \n\nSince my science classes and classes in general were so long ago, I\u2019ll need to take a few classes to 1) prove I can still do well in a classroom setting and 2) get some letters from recent professors for the whole application process. I plan on taking these classes during the Spring semester. \n\nI plan on enrolling into a CUNY due to the cost and hope to take two elective biology courses. I\u2019m hoping to get into two classes where the setting is intimate enough to get to know the professor so he/she can be comfortable writing a rec.\n\nI know everyone says Hunter is terrible for pre-health/science courses due to the weed out nature of the school, so any recommendations would be helpful. Hunter is convenient for me due to location, but I am open to any other recommendations when it comes to which CUNY to attend as well as which classes to take.   \n\nThank you",

From the overcrowding of the program to professors that do not care, lack of direction in advising as the premed dept. is understaffed + just pure weed out course. So save your sanity and go other cuny where it\u2019s not as cutthroat as here (if you want to know more search \u201chunter committee letter\u201d in /r/premed. Good luck!",

I went to Hunter because of the tough science courses, but the professors I took were very educational as a reason for their toughness, not just carelessness and trying to trick students; but they\u2019re gone from Hunter now.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely more difficult at Hunter, not just because of the courses, but because of the headless chicken nature of it. \n\nAlso their committee letter stuff has tight cuts; I was eligible for them until they changed the requirements like a semester before I were to apply, and the head who was my mentor resigned forcefully bc of politics, and so I didn\u2019t get the committee letter, and got a letter packet instead - which was fine.\n\nSo I just read your post more clearly, and it looks like you\u2019re just planning to take a few courses and get some letters and take MCAT and apply - I think it would be important to reach out to the pre-health department to see if that\u2019s possible - idk if they would require you to retake the basic pre- med courses to be eligible for their support - depending if you\u2019re looking to apply with the support of an institution, which is another major point of contention with applying to medical school.\n\nSo just look into the policies for applying and whatnot, since like who cares about electives, you can take them anywhere, and they\u2019re smaller classes and can get more intimate with professors, so doesn\u2019t matter, but if it\u2019s starting from scratch then it\u2019s a different story - good luck out there",

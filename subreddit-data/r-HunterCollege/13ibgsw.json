    "postText": "I\u2019m transferring into Hunter this Fall \u201823 from a CUNY 2-year with the specific goal of obtaining a Human Bio BA and immediately enrolling into their accelerated nursing program. Has anyone else done this or currently working towards this pathway? Some of the human bio required classes for track 1 seem easy enough, but I\u2019m more concerned about the harder stem/higher level courses like the BIO, PH, and NFS courses. I work 30 hours a week and need to keep a job while enrolled and this first semester I will be taking 12 credits, including asynchronous STAT 113.\n\nIs this doable? Or is this insane? I keep seeing talk about how hard Hunter\u2019s STEM courses are so I am low-key very anxious. I also feel that just like with anything in life if you have the right mindset and work hard it can be done. Just curious to see if anyone on here has a similar experience!",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone- \n\nWas wondering if anyone had some more info about living in the Brookdale Residence in NYC during the summer. \n\nI am specifically worried about the building having no A/C, and knowing that they don't allow small A/C units. Is it bearable to live through NYC'S summer heat with some fans and a humidifier? \n\nIf anyone has any experience living here during the summer or the hotter months of fall, would be great if you could share and indicate whether or not you recommend it considering the great price they offer.   Also, if there are other things that are worthwhile to note, feel free to add them.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "hey!\n\ni lived in Brookdale over the summer. it was a hot one and quite difficult to get through with just a fan, and that was with me being out from roughly 7-5 every day for my job. within those 12 or less hours that i was in the building i would usually take two, sometimes three showers and sometimes slept with a wet sheet (it sounds weird but it helps). i would not recommend living here if you\u2019re a homebody and are just gonna stay in your room which seems like it would defeat the purpose of living in Manhattan, make sure to get out for most of the day in the fresh air or the heat will really get to you. that being said, it was still worth it for the location and price. it does suck that we can\u2019t have visitors over the summer though so keep that in mind.\n\nalso, there are usually very few people living here in the summer so you won\u2019t have to deal with crowded kitchens or laundry room etc. it was pretty quiet, which for me was great.",

Hopefully her situation is better now. My favorite part was analyzing a film through the lens of propaganda and hidden messaging. The workload was pretty light, just some readings and film clips. We did discussion board posts, a shorter midterm essay and a longer final essay, nothing over 12 pages.",

We often watched movies/read articles for homework. We learned about various stereotypes in US media and talked a lot about racism in film, tv, music, etc. It was really interesting. I didn\u2019t totally connect with the professor but she was still a good teacher. I think the workload wasn\u2019t too bad in my opinion. There was a fun, open-ended final project.",

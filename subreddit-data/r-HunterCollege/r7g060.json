    "postText": "I am an incoming transfer student registering for spring 2022. I have to take intermediate 1 next semester but there\u2019s only like 2 class sections for it. I also noticed that a professor that teaches intermediate 1 &amp; 2, also teaches cost. It seems like that professor is the only accounting professor at the school, because I didn\u2019t see options for different professors that teach cost.",

Well at least compared to the sciences which make up the majority of Hunter. Good luck though, I was an accounting major Hunter grad.",

I chose to stay at Hunter, instead of transferring to Baruch (like many students opt to do), because I preferred the smaller classrooms getting to know the people/professors in the classes because we climb each requisite together. I don't know much about Queens College, I'm assuming it's also a smaller program there. Either way, I'm sure it'll be okay. I'm an auditor for a big4 now so I did fine.",

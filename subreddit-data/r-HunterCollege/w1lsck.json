Because I was waiting for my Tap to kick in but it still says pending and it will cover the whole thing. But im kinda paranoid that they will drop my classes because I didn't pay. What do I do?",

If you\u2019ll feel more at ease, you can message the financial aid office and the registrar\u2019s office and let them know @ finaid@hunter.cuny.edu and registrar@hunter.cuny.edu. I hope this helps!",

I talked to the school therapist and they told me they have to discuss about me with their colleague about my therapist being in a different area\n\nWell I thought they were supposed to sign you up for in school counseling. Sh didn't an said I shouldnt be in her for too long. I was wondering if I could go back and ask a different therapist if there's any difference.",

They are not professionally accredited, they will just refer you out and put you in deep trouble if you let out something too sensitive like domestic violence and suicide. I suggest you got to actual psychiatric. Best of luck!",

Who is they? What dept is supposed to sign you up for school counseling?\n\nUm anyways, yeah try to go back, maybe someone else can explain something further or clearer...",

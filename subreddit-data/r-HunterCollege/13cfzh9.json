    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking about going to Hunter for pre med but I\u2019ve been reading so many negative comments about the challenges classes and very high standards for a committee letter. I was wondering if anyone in Hunter pre med can share their current updates and thoughts on the school. Is a committee letter very important and would you guys say the classes are truly hard or is it because many people are entering them without much science knowledge (I took a few medical assisting and ap science courses although I\u2019m not sure how much that helps). Also, how hard is it to leave an impression on professors for reccs and getting research as well as other medical opportunities near the area. It\u2019ll save me a lot of money if I go here so I just wanted to check in.",

Their track record is basically them weeding out and not supporting 90% of students who wanted to. Hunter loves to give you roadblocks also, so think twice about coming here for premed. \n\nI epermited to Brooklyn college and classes were still challenging but way easier than Hunter.",

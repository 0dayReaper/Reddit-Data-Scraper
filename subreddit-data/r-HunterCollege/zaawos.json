    "postText": "My tap was delayed because of a name issue with parent 1 but it seems to be all resolved now as I spoke with a representative and they said it\u2019s all done and processed. They told me the award amount and I was able to view the awards for fall and spring on the hesc portal. Question is, would I still receive the fall award even as the semester is coming to an end or how exactly does that work?",

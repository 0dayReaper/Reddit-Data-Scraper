    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a little confused on how Excelsior works. I applied last year when going into college and I did receive aid from Excelsior. When I go on their website, it says I don\u2019t have to reapply for the 2023-2024 semesters so that means I don\u2019t have to right? So long as I still maintain the requirements correct? \n\nI went through the application in case but yeah, it mainly is worded for new time applicants so I\u2019d assume I don\u2019t have to reapply but I just wanted to make sure!",

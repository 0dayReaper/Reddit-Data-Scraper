    "postText": "I had to take an F for a class due to me having covid during finals. My professor was very dismissive and said the modality of the final was in-person and I wasn\u2019t able to come because of covid. I tested day of final was negative, emailed professor, and no response. I emailed department head as well no response. This brought my GPA down significantly and I do have a text thread stating that the professor was giving students answers on final. I receive full financial aid and really do not want an on my transcripts. What should I do?",

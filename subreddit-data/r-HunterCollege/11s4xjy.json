    "postText": "Im planning to take AFPRL 238 Intro Lit African Diaspora as my writing intensive for the summer. It says the professor is Eisa Ulen Richardson and I\u2019m hearing a lot of mixed reviews. Main criticism is that she is a very harsh grader and you have to read a lot for the class. I\u2019m a very slow reader and it takes me even longer to write a coherent essay using evidence. Has anyone here taken the class with her? Should I even attempt to??\nAlso please recommend me other intensive writing I could do for the summer if possible  \ud83d\ude4f",

            "comment": "Most writing intensive English/literature courses are going to be heavy on reading and writing. It\u2019ll be, of course, even more intense reading since it\u2019s in the summer session. As far as reviews go, take that with a grain of salt. It really depends on yourself. Sometimes you love the Professor despite the bad reviews and sometimes you\u2019ll hate the Professor despite the good reviews!",

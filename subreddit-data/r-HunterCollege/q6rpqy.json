    "postText": "I received an email of processed refund check notice on 10/8 from FAFSA. It\u2019s 10/12 today and I still have not received the check yet. Should I be worried? \nI know there\u2019s always a delay when receiving but I just wanna be sure because the Posted Date for the refund in cunyfirst is 10/05 and the disbursement date on cunyfirst was 9/20. \nI haven\u2019t been able to make a cuny direct deposit account yet. That\u2019s why I wanna know if it\u2019s either stolen or just a simple delay. Has anyone faced this delay in getting their checks?",

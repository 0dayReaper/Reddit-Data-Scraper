I agree with everyone else in the comment section",

To qualify for an A or A+, you have to take an additional exam for a separate module AND a project. Each objectives or modules have so many topics and some are due in 1 week, which is insane. \n\nTry to finish the easy topics first and then go to the medium topics and then the \u201chard\u201d ones. Generally, each topic should be the same, but as you go onto the next topic, it builds on each other with an additional step. Practice makes perfect.\n\nData Days are extremely stressful, but once you understand what they ask, it\u2019s pretty straight forward.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s like any other math class \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I also think ALEKS (the platform we\u2019re using) teaches the concepts better than the professors, but the professors have their own ways of teaching, which might or might not work for you.",

            "comment": "Try to finish the homework at least a day before its due because its hard to finish in one day alone. So if its due at 11:59 pm on January 30th finish it on January 29. It will save you alot of stress. Also the day before the test review the practice problems you struggled with on the homework. The tests are exactly like the homework so if you struggle on something in the homework try to practice it before the test. The data days are the worst part of stats so pay attention to the review session in class. Also don\u2019t be afraid to raise your hand on data days. Its graded like a test but you\u2019re allowed to ask questions.",

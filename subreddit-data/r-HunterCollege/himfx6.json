That means you don't even have to pay for the Chegg service, you can use it here for free instead. You just join the server and go to the Chegg channel, read the how to and thats all.\n\nDiscord link is discord.gg/college\n\nIt's also a social college server for all college students to make friends so you can chill and have fun too. There are people from Hunter, and other NY schools. Feel free to join!",

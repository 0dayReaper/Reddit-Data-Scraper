Sometimes it\u2019s printed on the inside few pages as well. \n\nBut if all you need is a copy of the book and not access to the site for assignments, then I would recommend asking your professor if an earlier edition is okay. They have Portales 1 (Introductory Spanish) on Amazon to rent for $47 or to buy the loose leaf version from other sellers (Click on other sellers from Amazon option) for like $25. \n\nIf you need access to the site for assignments/lectures, then your best bet is to buy from VHL directly as someone else said :(",

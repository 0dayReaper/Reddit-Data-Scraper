    "postText": "I took Chem 104 in Fall 2022 and did not put my all into it so I did pass/no credit and got pass for that semester. I retook the class this summer after doing the course repeat form and got a B. I checked degree works and saw the P was still there from Fall 2022 and the class I took this summer where I got the B was listed as insufficient credit. I was told by both the chemistry department and the registrar office that once I retook the class the P would be changed so I contacted them to see why it had not changed in my degree works and got this. \n\n\"Thanks for contacting us with this question. \u00a0Just to clarify, DegreeWorks is reflecting your CUNYfirst record and Hunter's policy. Basically, Hunter's policy is that the first passing course instance keeps the credits and when a student repeats such a course the second instance has 0 credits but both courses appear on the transcript (but only the first impacts the GPA)\"\n\nI was just wondering if this is one hundred percent accurate? I went in person to talk to them about this and they told me to make a support ticket to change it but then I'm hit with this. Again I'm kinda confused about this because both the chemistry and registrar office told me something different in person. I'm kinda bummed as well because this grade was supposed to help my GPA.",

            "comment": "From what I know, your second score would balance out the first but not necessarily replace it. There is no real incentive for retaking a class that you have failed at Hunter unless it is a required pre-req for future classes. For example, I got a C+ in Bio 102 &amp; considered retaking it. According to Hunter's policy at the time, retaking for a higher score would just \"balance out\" the GPA. Your new higher score doesn't replace the previous one.",

The psych classes in question are clinical psych, developmental psychopathology, adolescence, memory and attention, and sensation and perception.",

Are you taking two of these 300s to fulfill the psych electives? I\u2019d imagine most people pick from the 200s which are a bit lighter to fulfill this (I\u2019m also a psych major).",

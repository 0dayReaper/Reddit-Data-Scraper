Or are the math classes I take supposed to be based on my math milestone? \n\nAlso, Online it says that \u201cFirst time freshmen will be assigned a Math Milestone during the month of May based solely on their high school math coursework and math GPA\u201d but Idk my math milestone or know where to find it.",

Students who aren\u2019t satisfied w their given milestone can take the placement exam to override it.\n\nYou can only take the math classes in your math milestone or below. You can see the list of classes if you google hunter college math placement",

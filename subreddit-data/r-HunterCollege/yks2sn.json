            "comment": "Cause I know a friend who got an A in Physics in Hunter and needs to retake physics for the STEM program at Stony Brook and got a D. I also notice when I was studying at Stony Brook, my friends in CUNY (CCNY, Hunter, Queens, Brooklyn, and Baruch) kind of like meeting up almost every night to eat, hang out, part-time jobs (20 hour/week)or play at different parts of the city while I barely had any time. At most, I can only join 2 student clubs per week for about an hour and a 4-hour of work-study per week, 30 minutes in the gym maybe 2-3 times. Then the rest of the time in class or the library. (My friends and I were about the same level in high school). In the group chat, they sounded so free the whole day as if they were still in High School. I have to say, it Stony brook there is a big gap difference compared to High School. I have to work hard for the A while I don't need to do that in High School. I also notice some friends take a certain elective class over the summer at one of the CUNY to avoid certain classes at Stony Brook. So I really want to know, is the difficulty between Hunter and Stony Brook that large? I am so envious of my friends going to CUNY. Starting to regard going to Stony Brook. Kind of made me want to transfer over to join them.",

Professor James Brown teaches at SPS and is hands down one of the best professors I've ever had. The students that take the easy professors will regret that decision as all your classes lead to the next one.",

My cousin immigrated to the US from Asia and graduated from CCNY said the classes are a joke compared to his high school in Asia. But I never heard any foreign friends say classes at Stony Brook are easy. So I am very very curious if there is really such a big difference. But I find no information about that online. Just people around me made it sound like that. Is it that they teach the same thing but give fewer assignments and easier exams or something else?",

I know Doctors that did their undergrad at BC then went to Stony Brook. I keep hearing a lot of things about specifically about Hunter. I can tell you that BC, CC and SPS has some of the best Professors.",

Obviously, I am not referring to the system, the building, etc. I know professors will make the classes easier or harder for these classes at each institution. However, a professor are representing the institution so how they teach the class does affect the institution. But that is not my question here. My question is, is it true that the classes at CUNY easier regardless of the reason is due to professors or whatever the factor it is?",

For example i had people fail hunter anatomy and take anatomy at York college and get an A. I dont know anyone personally from stony brook but they are probably even harder with certain classes. Professor also makes a difference too",

Because it can still mean most professors or average professors at CUNY made classes too easy compared to the SUNY. I know many friends at different CUNY who are saying most professors at their schools are mediocre. I know many friend said the department made it easy and so on. Back then I don't need to care about it. But now, I have some decisions to make so that is why I want more information and see if there are different sayings. I am happy to hear something different from you.",

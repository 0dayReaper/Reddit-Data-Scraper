    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman and I got some holds on my account I thought I might ask you some questions since you already went through this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I got an email from Hunter College saying that I need to present proof of immunizations. Do I need to actually go in person and give it to them or do I email them a copy of it? If so what's the email?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Also when I was checking my financial information it said: To access this information, contact the Bursar's office to complete your account profile. What is that? idk\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.I got a hold on my account it says for advising.What is it that i have to to exactly do i need to go to the campus?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. I got holds from other colleges on my cunyfirst account. Did you get this problem aswell? If so how did you get rid of them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.I got into the seek program at hunter and i see only summer and fall semester on my account. Will spring be included after i complete my summer semester?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. I applied to Hunter as a computer science major but when i got check my status it says undeclared. Why is that if i applied as a computer science major? Did you get a problem similar to this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a lot. I've been trying to contact the office but i get no response. So i thought i might get a response on here from others who may have gone through this already.",

            "comment": "if you have access to your cunyfirst acc you can upload it there. But I think it's best to do it in person so they can clear you on the spot.   \n\n\nYou can ignore other cuny holds, they will not affect you at Hunter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll incoming freshmen come in as undeclared majors regardless of what you put on your application. You just have to declare your major before you hit 60 credits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyour advisement hold might remain there until you attend orientation and enroll for courses. as incoming freshmen you do not create your own schedule, you will be given block schedule options to choose from.",

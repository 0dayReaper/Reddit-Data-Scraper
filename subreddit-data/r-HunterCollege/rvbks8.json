            "comment": "I have! If you're going to take Professor Gong's class, you're going to have to focus on her lectures or at least take photos of her slideshows because she does not post them. She posts the recordings and from experience, it's needlessly difficult and tedious to go through them. Her tests make up most of the grade, but she gives a very hefty curve in order for people to pass. You're going to have to study the slideshows a week in advance and listen for any specific information in the lectures. The class is very boring but it's straightforward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn another note, I don't recommend her class at all. She's not an amazing nor professional professor. My class had an average of about 59% on the first test, and when we were going over the exam, one of my classmates decided to ask her if she could explain instead of giving the answers and it eventually snowballed into a verbal fight. As a result, her Rate My Professor score tanked since people left bad reviews afterwards. The next class, she pulled up the RMP website and demanded that people take down the reviews, and of course, nobody did until the second exam came along, and there was no curve on the exam for my class (Needless to say, people did not score well on that exam). She then stated that she had no plans on curving up the exams unless people left \"fair\" reviews for her, and if she liked them, the curve would be back. After leaving positive reviews, the curve was back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIMO, I didn't agree with my class being nasty towards her even though I could see where they were coming from, but I think that her practically blackmailing people to giving good reviews on Rate My Professor and taking down bad ones was extremely unprofessional. 0/10 class experience.",

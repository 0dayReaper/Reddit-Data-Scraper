I emailed again, and then they responded to both with just the address of the college and a number that was not in service. I then emailed an advisor directly and LUCKILY she was very nice and helpful but eventually couldn't help me anymore because shes probably getting a bunch of emails from other students while having to do the scheduling process herself.   \n\n\nHowever, I had almost no issue making an appointment with my academic advisor. It said my appointment was cancelled when I made it but, she still called so it was just a weird bug.",

I emailed them weekly for a month then started emailing 3 times a week, then after two weeks of that I spammed any person I could find with emails and I finally got a response. Their response was to wait. Another two weeks go by so I spammed them again, and they finally fixed my issue :). After 2 whole months. All they needed to do was click a button",

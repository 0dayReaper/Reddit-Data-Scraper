However, I did not receive the verification email in my Hunter email (I checked spam and etc). \n\nWhat should I do? This is a technical issue, and is there any alternative way to access the SAP Appeal form?\n\nAlso, for those who filed a SAP Appeal, how long do they take to respond back or verify the Appeal? How likely are they willing to accept the SAP Appeal? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53ruemwre3ba1.png?width=1323&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7b261dbb261a55aa74f27e8ea15258c63cc287fe",

Are they more likely to accept the appeal in most cases? \n\nBecause I am worried that my letter doesn\u2019t state any personal circumstances that affected my SAP requirement. It was nothing personal, it was just a mistake the financial aid office did. \n\nI am not sure if they will accept my appeal, because I was not on academic probation. They just made a mistake, because they saw I had taken previous semester at Hunter but I was only a non-degree student at that semester at Hunter (I was taking a epermit class only).",

You can explain that reason to them in your letter/statement. \n\nAnd it affected my Tap and pell but after it got approved, my tap and pell came back.",

The Math Placement Test (MPT) can be taken if you\u2019re not satisfied with your placement according to your Milestone found on CUNYFirst. To find out what\u2019s your milestone, go to  CUNYFirst &gt; Student Center &gt; Academic Records &gt; Milestone. Here\u2019s the link for information and conversion of what math course(s) you could take based on your milestone. This link also has the link for you to register for the MPT: http://cunyhunter.askadmissions.net/admin/Communications/ClickThru.aspx?qs=_fSyW48JJp09mKZ3iFLvsqXW7ESsoj4lddEtMz-H3XC726UZy9O4MqB8tFSPScBGe",

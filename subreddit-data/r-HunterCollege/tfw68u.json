    "postText": "Hey guys, two years ago I started college during the pandemic here at hunter, i feel like i haven't done anything ever since getting admitted. i was a nursing major but didn't get accepted into the program and i just don't know what to do, i was thinking about changing majors but i have no idea to what, i have a few choices but one part of me just wants to stick to nursing.\n\nis there anyone out here that went through the samething? if so, did you transfer schools? no other cuny has a nursing program like hunter that is convenient, well reputable, and not too far from where i live... i just don't know what to do and feel like this is all my fault.",

            "comment": "I heard people who don\u2019t make it first will aim for a random degree along the lines of human bio, psych, nutrition, biology etc and then apply for the accelerated program after graduating. I heard it\u2019s more competitive but don\u2019t let that stop you from applying because everyone else must feel the same stress and the more committed you are now, the closer you will be to achieve it. It\u2019s a longer journey and definitely more difficult but at least it will end with nursing. I applied for nursing fall 2022, and I\u2019m stressed, but I declared as a human bio major already as backup. If I don\u2019t get in soon, I will most likely continue human bio and end up applying for the accelerated program. I personally don\u2019t have the guts or energy to apply to a different school and go through the process again, but who knows if that works out for the best in the end for you? Also just a side note, I don\u2019t think it matters which nursing school you go to so don\u2019t be restricted only to Hunter and don\u2019t place Hunter as a measuring standard. The goal is to be a nurse and as long as you pass the NCLEX, everything else is almost irrelevant. Good luck on your decisions.",

If you don't mind me asking are you in the program currently, I had all the grade requirements met but my PAX was on the lower side (130), my gpa is a 3.71. \n\nDo you think it is worth a shot applying again for the next cycle or should i apply for the RN-BS program at hunter and just go to qcc now to qualify for this program at hunter? it's a risk doing so but i am not afraid of working hard, i just don't want to waste any time.\n\nKnowing that your mentor was accepted in their 4th year was really helpful knowing tho, that gives me a lot of hope! how many years would it take for her to graduate then, and did she take a and p already before being accepted?",

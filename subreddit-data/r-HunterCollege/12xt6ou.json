I know the Covid vaccine policies were recently lifted for CUNY, but does that also apply to the Brookdale Dorms? If no one knows, then who can I contact? I tried calling every phone number I could find online but none of the numbers were in service. Thank you for the help. This has been very stressful.",

They might respond to you and possibly help you out. Hope to see you in fall, and I hope everything works out for you!",

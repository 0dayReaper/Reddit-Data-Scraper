They have cameras you can borrow for certain production classes. I'm currently in a sound design class where I get to borrow a mixer. The downside is I think Hunter could use more exciting film electives, this upcoming fall semester, there are about 13 courses available, not including production classes. On the bright side, you can take classes from the media department.",

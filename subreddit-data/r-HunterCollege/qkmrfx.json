    "postText": "Can I double major when I'm almost done with college? I'm majoring in media studies but I also have taken a late liking for computer science. This is my junior year and going to go to my senior this spring of 2022. Consequently, I will spend 3.5 more years in hunter but I have enough pell grant that will cover it for an additional 3 years since pell grant covers 6. The last remaining semester, I might have to pay out of pocket. Is it too late?",

Yesterday I received a check for around $2250 instructions say I have to go to CVS, Walgreen, Target, and Walmart, buy 2000$ worth of American Express gift cards and send it to them and write a review like how the service was and similar things. I wonder if it's a scam. Did something like this happen to you?",

If they are looking for refunds doesn't that say something is wrong with accounting or bookkeeping department? i would be worried about cashing anything from a company like that.",

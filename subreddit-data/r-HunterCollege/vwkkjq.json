    "postText": "I recently checked my financial aid for how much I have to pay for the fall semester and I currently have no aid eventhough I have the Excelsior scholarship. I checked my HESC account and it still shows my Excelsior aid as pending. I was wondering if anyone knew when the aid would be given considering tuition is due soon or if they would just refund the money paid later on.",

    "postText": "Hello!\nI\u2019m an incoming freshman at hunter who will be going into the premed track. I specifically picked hunter because it\u2019s known for its science classes (and yes, I\u2019m unfortunately aware that they are hard \ud83d\ude2d), but I was wondering what some of you guys are now doing after graduating from hunter? I\u2019m aware that some might take gap years to get ready to apply for med school, and I\u2019m aware that some have already applied to med school. How was the process like being a hunter student? I\u2019ve heard that we have to do certain things in order to receive a letter of recommendation from teachers, how hard is it to do that? I also heard that we need a certain score from the MCAT in order to receive a committee letter\u2026how was the process like for some of you guys? Is it hard to find internship and research opportunities in hunter? Did you guys received help and support from teachers and mentors (if there even is one at hunter)?. Please share your experience, and thank you!\n\nEdit: I would also like to ask what are some things you would recommend a freshman at hunter to do? Like types of clubs, internships, volunteers, programs? What is something you wished someone told you that you think would\u2019ve helped you more as a hunter premed student?",

I graduated hunter and now am a 4th year dental student. \n\nI see these threads all the time and will spend my every last breath warn every single person: do not go to hunter for premed or prehealth. Hunter is \u201cwell known\u201d because they only give their best candidates support. Do not think \u201coh I\u2019m smart, I can totally handle it.\u201d Don\u2019t do it, you will have a significantly higher chance of getting into medical school if you went to another college. It is a scam and a bait and switch. \n\nWhen I was in prehealth I had to score a 90 percentile on the DAT, and get 5 letters of recommendations, and 8 evaluations and a 3.5 to get a committee letter. Now I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s more. I believe that my premed friends needed a 515 MCAT which is also around 90 percentile, not too sure. Hunter has probably crushed someone\u2019s chances who actually had the ability to go to medical school. It is a SCAM. Transfer out if you still can and ePermit the science prereqs if you cannot.",

While I was at hunter, I was not able to get into many year long classes like anatomy and physiology I and II, so I had to ePermit either the 1st semester or 2nd semester at another CUNY. I chose to go to Brooklyn college for these courses. The courses offered at Brooklyn were still challenging but nowhere near as ridiculous as hunter. (Hunter anatomy had like\u2026 8 tests. Who tf has time to study for all of those). I\u2019d say that Brooklyn college is a good pick. I was also a bio tutor at city tech, never took classes there but it seemed like they offer good support. Also consider Baruch. It was a school I considered but the schedule never worked it for me. And yes your sister could have been more upfront, but there are always those small percent of people who thought hunter was \u201cnot that bad.\u201d Of course, actually visit the subs and ask actual students and do research. Your primary goal should be to get into medical school, so you should take the most effective approach. Don\u2019t try to \u201ctough it out.\u201d \n\nAlso, since you are premed, it is a little different from predental. From my understanding after talking to my premed colleagues at hunter, you guys only need to take the basic prereqs like bio, chem, orgo, physics, math, etc but you don\u2019t have the other stuff like anatomy, micro, biochem and stuff (they are recommended for premed but not necessary). So a lot of my premed friends picked like a psych major and went for the easiest route possible. If that is still true, then you could always just get a psych major, work really really hard to get a high GPA then study for the MCAT. OR you could get the hell out of that hell hole. \n\nAnd to answer your other questions, those hard classes were 100% not helpful in dental school. Undergrad is about learning and getting a hang of it, dental school is about time management because they shove 10-15 classes in your face per semester. So hunter was about in between regular undergrad and dental school in terms of stress. There were a handful of courses that I found helpful like anatomy and physiology. Dental school biochemistry was nothing like hunters. At hunter they made us remember the amino acids and other intro stuff like Henderson hasselbach equation and which amino acid precipitates in which pH levels, but here we are actually learning way more in depth mechanisms and how it effects the human body, it\u2019s completely different. All those hard courses at hunter were pointless. If I were to choose, I\u2019d just go to an easier school because I had such a tough time getting into dental school, even though I scored 95 percentile on the DAT. This was mostly due to hunters lack of support.",

            "comment": "Graduated Hunter Macaulay a few years back, lectured and published research in the chem department there afterward while trying to figure out my life path, and am going to start a New York MD program in July. I'll try my best to answer as many of your questions as I can, and if you have more, please feel free to DM me.\n\n- How was the process like of being a Hunter student?\n\nIt's definitely very challenging, especially if you didn't have a good study ethic like I did. YMMV, if you're in one of their honors programs, you'll likely dodge a lot of the problems mentioned in other posts. You get priority registration for classes, so it's very unlikely you'll have issues getting into them, and you'll have your own advisor who will guide you in terms of keeping up with the requirements and scheduling. \n\nHunter prehealth is definitely a huge challenge to overcome, especially if you want a committee letter. Since there's only two prehealth advisors, they've put a metric ton of roadblocks to achieving a committee letter presumably so they can write as few as possible, and they seem to increase the difficulty of getting one each year as med schools become more selective. I would also describe the advisors as having battleaxe-type personalities, which is very, very hit or miss for most people. If they think your credentials suck, they WILL take a dump on you for it, and they can be quite ruthless. If anything I'd say it's good practice for dealing with the more difficult personalities you'll encounter throughout your medical training. If you must do so through Hunter, I think this roadmap sums up what you need to do really, really well:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkRryNQaznKtGr8AQY52ZQqzQ5CL4cKMV6aMqmx3nck/mobilebasic\n\n- Letters of Recommendation\n\nYou need 6 for the committee letter, 2 science professors, 1 MD/DO, 1 research PI, and the other two your choice. It sounds annoying at first, but even without the hard requirement, I would recommend you get as many as you can anyway in case you end up with a mediocre one. As for how difficult, it seems impossible as a student, and I thought so too. But after teaching there, I was really shocked to find out just how few Hunter students would try to reach out for help. In a given lecture or lab course, I would say less than 3-5% of the enrolled students showed up to office hours, even fewer on a consistent basis, and the number goes down even further as the semester progresses considering withdrawals. This was the case even for the lecture professors with huge class sizes; some of their office hours would have like 10-15 students max before exam week, even though class sizes can get up to 1000 in genchem 1. If you show up to even half of the available office hours, demonstrate a willingness to learn, let the prof learn your name, do not, do not ever beg/argue about grades, and get a decent letter grade in the course (B and above,) pretty much all of my colleagues would be really happy to write you a letter. \n\nIn retrospect, the MD letter was much more challenging to get because of how busy attending physicians are and how difficult it was to build even a slight relationship with them amidst the total mania of the hospital. I had to write mine myself and have the doc sign it.\n\n- Internship/Research\n\nFor all Hunter prehealth's faults, I do really like their listserv. It spoonfeeds you available volunteer/internship/clinical/research opportunities available in the area, a lot of it insider. It also lets you know when a doc is coming to Hunter to speak, the Doctor Speaker series. I wish I took more advantage of this, like I said, didn't really know what I was doing when I was a student. If you can attend a talk, you can ask for shadowing (notoriously difficult to get if you don't come from a physician/nurse family) and if you make a good impression after a few shadowing sessions, you can ask them about clinical research. The type of research (clinical/translational/basic science) doesn't matter for med school. I had to do basic science to graduate Macaulay, but clinical is much easier to get posters/presentations/publications from, which will make you really stand out for top schools. The most difficult thing is getting your foot in the door, once you're in, it's a lot easier. It's just like applying for jobs.\n\n- Teachers/Mentors\n\nThis is pretty much the sole reason that despite everything with Hunter prehealth and despite all my mistakes with premed in general, I don't regret my time as a student at Hunter. I met a truly wonderful and supportive professor there who is practically like an older brother to me now. We published a bunch together and he even hooked me up to teach there after I graduated. Now some Hunter faculty are much more approachable than others, don't get me wrong. But as I said earlier, so few Hunter students actually reach out to faculty on a consistent basis that if you're one of those few, as long as it's not always about grades and especially not grade grubbing, you automatically stand out in a good way. Basically, don't be a premed gunner. We absolutely hate those, and so does pretty much every science faculty member ever. I genuinely believe if you put in the time to build the relationship by showing you're an enthusiastic learner, your profs will be more than happy to reciprocate. \n\nAs for mentorship, Hunter has a prehealth mentor program you can sign up for; the mentors consist of either junior/senior Hunter students, or alums like myself. If you are assigned a mentor, take advantage! From my experience, very few mentees even try to keep up the once per month required appointments, much less reach out beyond that.\n\n- What to do as a freshman\n\nTry to really think about what your passions truly are, both in terms of major/career and in terms of just what makes you as a person happy to be alive. They'll guide you for what to pursue, and make you a more genuine person, not just for apps/interviews, but life in general. Ask yourself: Do you even want to be a doctor, or are you just being pressured to try to be one by money/family/whatever? Have you considered nursing/PA/dental, etc.? It takes 11 years absolute minimum to become an attending physician here including undergrad, assuming no gap years (a lot of premeds take 2-3 now,) and you have to be the best student you can be pretty much the entire way. You'll have to continue the volunteer/grades/leadership/research rat race in med school because of residency applications, and residency itself is most of the time fairly miserable 80+ hour work weeks with paltry wages just to get board certified. Throw in that you'll likely have 150k-400k+ debt to pay off from med school loans too. Your similarly intelligent non med friends will very likely have established 9-5 40 hr/week careers, relationships, and savings. They'll be traveling, getting married and having kids with their SO's and saving up for a house and retirement while you're in the books studying for Step/board exams or taking call in the wards at 1 am. Is that a sacrifice you're willing to make?\n\nAnyway, I really hope this helps. And like I said, feel free to DM if you need any advice, and best of luck!",

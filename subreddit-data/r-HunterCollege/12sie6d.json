As long as the course is an equivalent and is open at the host college AND the department doesn\u2019t have like restrictions on epermitting certain courses (like baruch accounting). But I have seen people mention that if you\u2019re trying to be CPA eligible you might run into issues if it\u2019s at a community college. The accounting credits should be from a introductory and upper class courses from a 4 year program or masters I think. So if CPA is the end goal id consult with an advisor first if not go for it.",

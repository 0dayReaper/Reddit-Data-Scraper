    "postText": "I just transferred here and although my schedule is fully in person, one of my classes is remote for the first few weeks. I have class immediately before and after the time I'm supposed to attend the zoom lecture, and I live about an hour from campus so going home isn't an option. At my old school they had a system where you could reserve a room in the library to study privately or take online class, I was wondering if there was anything like this at Hunter, and if not what are some alternatives I could consider?",

(just walk in if it's free and if someone kicks you out then leave)",

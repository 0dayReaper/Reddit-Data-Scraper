I thought It was going to be the other way around. I am unsure and lost about my major and was relying on finance or cis. A lot of hunter students are saying to just transfer, but how do you feel about the econ department and or cs department. Any help is appreciated",

I remember having to explain to the bursar office that I am tired if going back and forth and told her you do realize we've exchanged over 30 emails and yet she was not being clear.\n\nIts not only the bursar. As you mentioned you just got to do everything yourself and do what's expected. I do not like the environment. \n\nIf I had a choice I would have never went.",

This is especially common for English classes since they can fulfill both the writing intensive requirement and the English composition requirement. \n\nDegreeWorks is what everyone uses to make sure they\u2019re one track to graduate. It\u2019s great because it lists all the possible classes you can take the fulfill that requirement. Hopefully looking there can answer your question about the specific class. You can find DegreeWorks in the Student Center after logging into CUNYFirst. I hope that helped!",

    "postText": "I'm a transfer that is new to Hunter this semester (going into junior year). I took Spanish throughout all 4 years of high school, and I was able to be exempted from 12 credits of a language. But, that means those 12 credits have to be taken in any subject of my choosing. Can anyone recommend a subject that is relatively easy that can fulfill these 12 credits?",

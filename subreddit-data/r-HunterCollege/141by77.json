    "postText": "As you all probably saw, [Reddit is killing third party apps using its API](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/) and it will affect us all badly. [I made a poll couple of hours ago](https://strawpoll.com/polls/kjn18YKP0yQ) on whether should we go dark or not on the date mentioned above and so far people said yes (albeit it was not much people who voted). So this subreddit will go dark starting June 12th, we might end on 14th or continue going dark depending on the response of Reddit. I know our community is small but every subreddit going dark matters and there's already a [growing list of subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) that will be going dark that will affect the Reddit more as whole. I am thinking of ways to go dark. It could be either setting the whole subreddit private with a message (it seems reddit do not show the message), removing every new post and sending a message through auto-moderator explaining why or just having it on every posts top-level comment (see below). I will update this post will relevant details as time comes. If you have any feedback\u2014feel free to suggest here. Thank you for reading!",

            "comment": "Thanks for your submission to r/HunterCollege.  \n\nDid you know that effective July 1st, 2023, Reddit will enact a policy that will make third party Reddit apps like [Apollo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575), [Reddit is Fun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit), [Boost](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubenmayayo.reddit), and others too expensive to run?  On this day, users will login to find that their primary method for interacting with Reddit will simply cease to work unless something changes regarding Reddit's new API usage policy.\n\nConcerned users should read and sign on to this [open letter to Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) We thank you for reading this, /r/HunterCollege will be taking action and \"going dark\" from June 12-14th.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/HunterCollege) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

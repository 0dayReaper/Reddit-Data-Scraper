    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI applied to hunters msw program on January 31st. Today I checked the status of my application and it says that it was submitted on Jan 31st and was completed on March 22nd. I am now wondering why that is. I was not missing any documents in my application. So now my question is, what do they mean by application completed? I thought my application was completed when I submitted it in January.",

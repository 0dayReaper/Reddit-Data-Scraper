    "postText": "Hello. I am a Canadian Citizen and student wanting and planning to transfer to Hunter College.\n\nHere in Canada we have college and university. (community college in the states = our college, university in the states = university in Canada) in college, we can end up graduating with a diploma (two years, 4 semesters usually) or advanced diploma, (3 years, 6 semesters). Right now I am doing an accounting advanced diploma, I can decide to end it early and go with a regular diploma if I wanted, but my ultimate goal is to transfer to an American College. Earlier today I understood that in America, when someone goes community college and then later goes into a state university, they complete their degree in the university, and don\u2019t end off with any sort of half degree in college. So what I am trying to understand is, do I need to complete my diploma here in order to transfer or no? I am planning everything early on so I can have a smooth transition instead of having to wait and plan everything out at the end. If anyone can help that would be amazing, or should I call the international department and ask for help? My advisor has told me to contact the College and Unis I plan on transferring to, since they can\u2019t help much and admit it.\n\nPlease let me know, I do need some help, advice and guidance so I looked to this reddit for help.",

You won\u2019t get a \u201chalf degree\u201d but a full degree at Hunter depending on how many credits you\u2019ve completed at Hunter. There\u2019s no need to complete a full diploma if you want a regular one at Hunter, I believe.",

I am a clinical psych major and one of the requirements is 2 science courses with a lab component, I have taken Astronomy and Physical Anthropology (I took chem 102 in freshman year but it didn't count apparently), previously on my degreeworks they both fulfilled the requirement, though now the anthro lab I took is under \"elective credits not allowed\" and antro 101 is under \"split credits.\" I really hope this is just a glitch, but if anyone could provide an answer that would be really helpful",

It might be a glitch but I would email the psych department, they respond back quickly. This is the email: psychadv@hunter.cuny.edu",

I'm not sure if you'll have to do the same thing but definitely email your advisor or the psych dept.",

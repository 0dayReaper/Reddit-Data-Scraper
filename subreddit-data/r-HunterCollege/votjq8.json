You can ask in the questions part of the Hunter discord and likely get responses from cs majors quicker than using reddit.",

CS is a complicated major and they have the best professors and support at City College. Hunter is more of a social science, psych, nursing, pre-med type of school. If you\u2019re studying CS, be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material. Some of the CS courses are super difficult and unnecessary.",

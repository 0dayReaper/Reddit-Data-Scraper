    "postText": "Hey guys, I am starting my freshman year at hunter and I couldn\u2019t be more excited! My commute is only 20-30 mins depending on how well the trains run, but I was thinking of a different alternative for transportation. Recently I\u2019ve wanted to get an electric scooter because they are pretty fast and are portable. I want to go this route because after using the MTA for all my life, I don\u2019t want to deal with the constant delays and crazy encounters anymore. Since hunter is a quick ride over the queensboro bridge for me, a scooter would be perfect. However, I am unsure of how I would secure it once I got to Hunter. I am weary of locking a scooter up outside, especially in Manhattan. Is there any place inside Hunter that would allow me to store my scooter safely? Can I just roll it around campus to each class? This would help solidify my cause to get an electric scooter.",

There were often 2-3 e scooters including mine in a couple of the lecture halls I went to and no one has ever said anything. In fact some professors were intrigued and asked questions about speed, range, etc.",

However, if you have any lab classes that would not be allowed in the room as it is a safety hazard. If its a lecture room, it would be fine just sit in the back and keep the scooter out of the way. \n\nMoving around the campus with the scooter might be a struggle, since the west building is mainly escalators. The north building does have elevators, but that really does depend on where your classes are.",

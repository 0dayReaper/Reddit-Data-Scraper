    "postText": "Hi, im an incoming freshmen and I\u2019m in the Daedalus computer science honors program and I also got accepted to Georgia Tech as a Guranteed Transfer on the condition that I fulfill certain course requirements at hunter. My projected schedule for Daedalus students includes almost every course I need to take except for a lab science (physics, chemistry,  biology, environmental science) and I have one spot open on my schedule with courses I have to take. I emailed my advisor to ask if I can take a science course like physics as that extra course I need to take and he said that I can\u2019t be a part of the Daedalus Program if I don\u2019t meet the requirements for courses I\u2019m taking which confused me because I only need to take an extra course and it\u2019s not like I was refusing to take the required courses. When I asked him to clarify if I\u2019m able to take the classes or not he gave yet another unclear answer and said I need to take the courses planned for me which still leaves room for the extra class I need to take. I don\u2019t get what the confusion for him was. My question is this- Can I take a science course on top of the honors program required curriculum and can I enroll in a science course regardless to meet Georgia tech\u2019s requirements.",

            "comment": "The Scholars Program should've sent you a list of course sections that you're required to enroll in for this semester.  You must enroll in those listed course sections, unless you have AP or college credits transferred in and processed that satisfies a requirement that makes one of the listed courses unneeded (which in that case, drop only the unneeded ones).  The maximum credit load per semester is 17.5, so take 17.5 and subtract out the remaining courses credits Daedalus requires you to enroll in.  The difference becomes the number of credits you can use for whatever you want.  Since you're looking for a lab science, check the catalog for a lab science course that still has seats, that you meet the prerequisites for, timing-wise doesn't overlap with your other classes, and has a credit count that fits in the remainder of your 17.5 budget.",

They have one section in the sample honors student schedule that says 1 extra course to be selected after speaking with advisor. They sent a list of \u201capproved\u201d courses that I should take as that extra class but I will get college credit for two of the classes listed there. So I\u2019ll be fine if I take the science course as long as it fits into the credits and doesn\u2019t interfere with other classes?",

    "postText": " I am currently a freshman at Hunter College applying for the nursing program fall 2022. I have a couple of questions regarding how the application works.\n\n1. Is the NursingCAS and the NLN Pax exam separate applications, in other words, since the deadline for the NursingCAS is Feb 1st for me, can I still take the NLN Pax exam later than Feb 1st?\n2. Since the deadline for the NursingCAS is Feb 1st, I will only be just a month into my second semester, so how does the prerequisiste classes for the semester get added into my gpa.\n3. Should I send in a pdf transcript of only my first semester?",

            "comment": "Hi, I\u2019m a sophomore in the program\n\n1. You have to register for both NursingCAS and the NLN Pax exam separately. You have to submit the application by Feb 1st, but you have until the end of Feb to take the PAX. (Not sure if they changed this but that was what happened for my year)\n\n2. The second semester gets counted into the application after the second semester ends. You\u2019ll have to put in your grades for the Spring term, and then your GPA will get updated after your application is verified. If you get accepted into the program, then you\u2019ll have to send in your official transcript that includes your Spring semester. \n\n3. Yes! You\u2019ll input your Spring grades later so for now, they are only looking for your Fall grades. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, and I hope this helped!",

How would I do that if I already submitted my application?",

There\u2019s an edit option that allows you to do so, and then you\u2019ll resubmit your application. If you do get in, however, you\u2019ll also have to send in your official transcript, which there should be a button for you to do so. You\u2019ll also get email updates about sending in grades and transcripts from nursingcas, so follow their directions when it\u2019s time!",

For your personal statement, I\u2019m not 100% sure of what the requirements are, but you basically tell them about yourself. You can include the reason why you want to pursue nursing, any relevant experience, extracurriculars, and/or clubs. It\u2019s really all up to you on what you think you should include, but I think the most important things to get across are who you are, why you want to pursue nursing, and where you see yourself in the future. My personal statement was around 3 pages. Hope this helps and good luck!",

I was super nervous about it, so I blanked a few times in the exam, but overall, very straightforward. There\u2019s English, math, and science, all of which are high school level (I felt like some questions were easier than high school level). Study out of the red book (made by the NLN), do practice tests, use apps for flash cards, and go over questions you got wrong. If you need to brush up on some skills, definitely do so, but overall, nothing too tricky. I feel like my nerves made it a lot harder than it really was.",

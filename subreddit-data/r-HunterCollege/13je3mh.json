Difficulty is relatively the same so as long as you stay on top of work and do the same thing you did last sem then you should be fine. chem 106 is alright just lab reports can be a pain so try to get those out of the way to make sure you have enough time for other classes. Also you don't need to buy the chem notebook for 106. You don't even need the lab manual tbh but some post lab questions may be different then the older versions online.",

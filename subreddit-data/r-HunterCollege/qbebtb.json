I\u2019m just curious because I\u2019m considering transferring from Hunter to Queens and I was kind of hoping I wouldn\u2019t need to resend all the high school stuff since it takes a while (and will probably be even longer since all the high school seniors are dealing with their admissions right now too). I haven\u2019t been able to get a straight answer, sorry to take the focus away from your question.",

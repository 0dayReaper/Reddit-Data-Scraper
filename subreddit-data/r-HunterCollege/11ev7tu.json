I am scheduled to graduate this May from a CC my gpa will likely be 3.5-3.6 if your coming from Hs they will probably want in the 3.5-3.6 range. I didn\u2019t write one because I wasn\u2019t overly concerned as Hunter isn\u2019t my first choice. They have a relatively low acceptance rate for a CUNY. If you don\u2019t think you are a sure thing it would help to write an essay.",

                            "comment": "So I didn\u2019t get in from my high school grades. I got my associates at a community college and like I said had only a 3.4 when I applied. Hunter is a competitive school but I don\u2019t think their Cs department is *especially* competitive since it\u2019s a Libera Arts School. Since they are Liberal arts they only degree they award for Cs is a Bachelors of Arts and not the more common Bachelors of Science. \n\nA lot of people would prefer a BS over a BA but it really doesn\u2019t matter *that* much in the grand scheme of someone\u2019s career. In fact then offering a BA in Cs was a draw to me because I would prefer to take liberal arts credits over additional science and math that aren\u2019t a part of the Cs curriculum. I would think CCNY would be the hardest school to get into for Cs since it\u2019s the only CUNY school that\u2019s specifically for engineering and is ranked highly (and it\u2019s cheep). Queens college also has a great reputation for Cs since it apparently has good connections with FAANG. \n\nHunters acceptance rate is about 36% last time I googled it and they look for about a 3.6 GPA as per google. so it\u2019s not insanely hard to get into.. I also don\u2019t go to hunter so if I\u2019m wrong anyone can feel free to correct me. I don\u2019t want to misinform or mislead anyone.",

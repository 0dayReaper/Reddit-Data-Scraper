    "postText": "Dear Fellow Hawks,\n\nHere you will find the most common questions and answers that came up in both the Hunter Discord Server and Hunter Subreddit. **Before you post here, please check this FAQ for your question--it may already have it answered.** We update it periodically and its generously written by /u/winneh7 in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/3TrGtqu) and I am copying it here for your convenience. ***To get the most updated version of this FAQ please visit our server and check out the FAQ channel***\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Enrollment**\n\n### I'm an incoming freshman, how do I enroll in classes for my first semester?\n\nFreshmen are usually assigned block schedules. You can find out more in your Admitted Student Portal that will be sent to your email. \n\n### What's in my Admitted Student Portal?\n\n- Orientation dates and registration\n- Advising information\n- Information on how to access your MyHunter email\n- Etc. \n\n### I'm a transfer, how do I enroll in classes?\n\nYou will be assigned an advisor but enrolling will be done by yourself. You will also have a newly admitted students portal that will guide you.\n\n### What is an enrollment time?\n\nYour personalized enrollment time states the time that CUNYFirst will allow you to start enrolling in your class. It is very important to be online at exactly your enrollment time to try to get your desired classes. Your enrollment time will include both a date and a certain time. \n\n### How do I check my enrollment time?\n\nYour enrollment time can be found on CUNYFirst &gt; Student Center &gt; Enrollment Time Details &gt; Select Term\nSpring and Fall semesters are \"Regular Academic Session\" and your Appointment Begins is when you can start enrolling in classes\n\n### When's the last day to enroll in a class?\n\nThe last day to enroll in a class is usually during the first week after the semester has started. You have plenty of time to enroll for classes but it is advised to plan our your schedule beforehand to get the professor and times you want. \n\n### What is the maximum number of credits I can take per semester?\n\nFall/Spring = 17.5\n\nSummer = 7.5 (per session)\n\nWinter = 3/4\n\n### What if I want to take more than max credit?\n\nYou will have to apply for a credit overload\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Printing** \n\n### What\u2019s the school\u2019s wifi and how do I log in?\n\nThe school is currently moving from Hunternet to Huntersecure but the login info for both is the same. You use your netid and password to log on. You can connect multiple devices onto wifi. \n\n### Where do I find my NETID?\n\nIf you do not your netid or password you can [locate it here.](https://netid.hunter.cuny.edu/verify-identity)\n\n### Is printing free?\n\nEach student at the beginning of each semester will be given a credit of $15 for them to spend on printing black/white or color. The prices for each page is listed in the photo attached. Keep in mind balances do not carry over to the next semester which means there\u2019s no point of saving your $15. \n\n### How to use school printer?\n\nSome printers work differently however I have listed the ones + method for the ones i know. \n\nMain campus (69th st) 4F printer and Brookdale library printers:\n\n* Use one of the computers on the left side of entrance and print from wherever you need (blackboard/google doc etc.) \n* Once you hit control + P it will ask you to type in username. The username is your netid. \n* Log off blackboard or whatever you logged into. Head over to the printer and scan id - the printer will open your printing queue. Select the files you want to print.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Financial Aid**\n\n### How to apply for financial aid?\n\nEvery year on October 1st the FAFSA application is released. You complete the next year\u2019s application. Ex: We are currently in 2022 but on FAFSA we are filling out the application for 2022-2023. Remember to also do TAP (will be linked when you\u2019re done with FAFSA). \n\n### If I get financial aid do I have to pay the tuition?\n\nThat depends on how much financial aid you get. If the amount of pending aid you have is less than your tuition then you have to pay the difference. If your financial aid is more than the cost of tuition then you don\u2019t have to pay anything, just sit back and wait for the extra fin aid to deposit into your direct deposit or check. \n\nIf you do end up paying full tuition and you get financial aid, don\u2019t worry. Once the financial aid is processed you will get back everything that\u2019s extra. \n\n### Is it too late to enroll into direct deposit for refunds?\n\nIt\u2019s never really too late to enroll however if you see a refund will be distributed in one day and you want to enroll into direct deposit for that refund you wont be able to do so. You can enroll but that refund will still be sent as a check because enrolling one day before distribution is too late for the system to change the format. \n\n### I see a refund distributed today but it\u2019s not in my direct deposit?\n\nRefunds generally take 3-5 business days to get to your account. So add 3-5 business days to your distribution date. If you do not see something by then you can go ask the bursar office.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Waitlisting**\n\n### How to get on the waitlist for a course that's filled?\n\nWhen adding the course to your shopping cart make sure to check the box that says waitlist if the class is full. Even if you see the class is full you have to press enroll to be placed on a waitlist. \n\n### How do I check my position on the waitlist?\n\nCUNYFirst &gt; Student Center &gt; Weekly schedule &gt; List View \nThere is also a position 0 on the waitlist so being in the first position does not mean you're next. \n\n### Will I be automatically enrolled into the class if there's a spot open and I'm next?\n\nCUNYFirst automatically enrolls the next eligible student. \n\nYou will NOT be automatically enrolled in a class if:\n\n* The class time conflicts with another class you're enrolled in\n* You will be put over the allowable credits. (Max cr 17.5 for fall and spring. Max cr 7.5 for summer)\n* Some of the available seats are reserved for a specific group of students (ex: transfers and learning community)\n* There is a hold on your account. To check this go on CUNYFirst &gt; Student Center &gt; on the right side under Holds\n* Transfer credit was already received for the equivalent course. \n\n###  Will I be notified if I'm enrolled?\n\nNo, there will be no notifications after being enrolled in the course. You will have to check your CUNYFirst from time to time to see if you have been enrolled and your current waitlist position. \n\n###  How often do people drop the class?\n\nMore people than you imagine drop the class before or during the first week of the semester. \n\n### What do to if my class has no waitlist?\n\nYou can download [coursicle (referral)](https://coursicle.app.link/4DcEUZZVjlb) notify you when a spot opens.\n\n##### **[More Information on Wait-List Can be Found Here](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/register-for-classes/waitlist/)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Honors**\n\n### Does Hunter offer honor programs ?\n\nYes.\n\n### Freshmen only (you apply as incoming freshmen) programs:\n\n* Athena: Humanities and Philosophy \n* Daedalus: Computer Science\n* Muse: Visual and Performing Media and Creative Writing\n* Nursing: Leadership in the Field of Nursing\n* Roosevelt: Policy, Law, Civic Life, and Social Science\n* Yalow: Scientific Research Pre-Med \n\n### Programs you can apply as a Hunter student:\n\n* Thomas Hunter Honors Program (THHP)\n* McNair Scholars Program\n* McNulty Scholars Program \n\n##### **[Learn More About the Programs Here](https://hunter.cuny.edu/honors-scholars-programs/)** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Degreeworks**\n\n### What is degreeworks?\n\nDegreeworks will be your graduation best friend. You need to make sure all those red boxes highlighted turns green or blue during your final semester to be able to apply for graduation.\nThat is also your guide in determining what classes you need to take to graduate. \n\n[Graduation Requirements are listed here](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/advising/my-academic-path)\n\n### How do I use degreeworks?\n\n##### **[General Tutorial on DegreeWorks](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/cis/degreeworks/#1664568855429-7decfa7d-e45d)**\n \n### How do I see major requirements if I\u2019m still undeclared?\n\nThere\u2019s 2 ways to go about this. One is thru [DegreeMaps](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/advising/my-academic-path/Degree%20Maps%202.0) or using DegreeWorks directly. \nPersonally if you\u2019re just looking for overview of the classes you need I would recommend looking at DegreeMaps because it\u2019s easier to understand/locate. \nIf link does not work: Google Hunter College DegreeMaps 2019 (be careful there\u2019s an older version still public) \nIf you have decided you want to use DegreeWorks - use the What If function to view your major requirements. \n\n### Why are there so many classes listed in one requirement?\n\nThose classes are options that will fulfill the requirement. Degreeworks is more accurate than hunter website. If you\u2019re unsure why a course you found on hunter\u2019s website is not listed in the requirement you are trying to fill, contact the department and confirm that you are able to fulfill the requirement taking that certain course since it\u2019s not listed on DegreeWorks. \n\n### What do the @ classes mean?\n\nIf you see a course listed as ex: ASIAN 210@ it just means you can take a course with any course starting in ASIAN 210, the last 2 numbers don\u2019t matter and will fulfill the requirement.\n\n### Why is a course I\u2019m taking as major elective requirement not listed in the correct category?\n\nMake sure your course is listed as one of the options in the requirement. If you think this is a mistake you can contact the department or email senate@hunter.cuny.edu \n\n### Where to find courses to take for elective besides DegreeWorks? \n\n##### **[Courses for Hunter Common Core Locate Here](https://hunter-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/policies-and-requirements/academic-requirements/general-requirements/general-education-common-core)**\n\n##### **[Courses for Pluralism &amp; Diversity Located Here](https://hunter-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/pages/vtRVaRrZbd27vw1jVq6X)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Falling Behind in A Class?**\n\n### Think you\u2019re falling behind in a class and don\u2019t know what to do?\n\nThe general idea of applying pass/no credit for a class is to receive credit for the course without receiving a letter grade. A Pass (P) will be given instead of A, B, C, or D. No credit will replace a F. P/nc will not be calculated into one\u2019s GPA. \n\nMany majors have their own restrictions in addition to the restrictions listed in the pdf so confirm you are able to p/nc the class before doing so. There is also a maximum of 4 courses you can p/nc (cr/nc) throughout your 4 years at hunter so choose wisely. \n\nWhen requesting for p/nc keep in mind if youre going to graduate school or medical school they may not favor p/nc grades. They may also convert your P into a D and NC into a F. Check with the school you are planning to go to. \n\nA F will be calculated into your GPA but if you retake the course and get a higher grade the F will no longer be calculated into GPA but will remain on your transcript. \n\n##### **[More Information P/NC Can be Found Here](https://hunter-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/policies-and-requirements/academic-requirements/grading-policies/pass-no-credit-policy-for-undergraduate-courses)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Hunter College Spots To Go**\n\n### I have a gap where should I go?\n\nThe most common place to go would be the library. \n\nLibrary is located in the East building Fl B2 - 7F \nB2, B1, 1, 2, and 3 are silent floors (please be quiet) \n4, 6, and 7 are group floors (can talk)\n\nThere\u2019s also a \u2018lounge\u2019 or what hunter calls Digital dining booth. It fills up pretty quickly and stays packed till night time. \n\n### Where can I go to eat?\n\nThe cafeteria\u2019s located in the West building (near the down escalators).\nThe lounge I mentioned above is also a place to go. \nLast resort - just eat in library (rec food that doesnt have a strong scent) and dont get caught by security\nThe 4F allows snacks but if you\u2019re bringing a full meal just be careful.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Registration Information**\n\n* **[Policies &amp; Form](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/policies-and-forms/)**\n \n* **[Records &amp; Transcripts](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/)**\n\n* **[Apply to Graduate](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/apply-to-graduate/)**\n\n* **[Students](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/)** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # **Laptop Loan** \n\n### Can I loan a laptop for a semester?\n\nYes you can. You would have to fill out a request form each semester. The form is usually out a week or two before the semester starts. There has been some delays in the time they release the forms so keep checking the site if you do not see a link to the forms. \n\n##### **[More Information On Laptop Loan Can be Found Here](https://ww2.hunter.cuny.edu/students/student-life/emergency-support-and-resources/laptoploan/)**\n\n### Are there devices I can loan for a day?\n\nYes, there are! Visit the A/V desk on 2nd floor of Leon &amp; Toby Cooperman Library (East building - main campus) for either 3 hour loans or all day loans. You will need a valid OneCard + another form of ID + no blocks on your accounted to loan a computer. \n\n##### **[More Information On Devices Can be Found Here](https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/laptop-loan-policies)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # Directory &amp; Summer/Winter Courses \n\n### Where can I find my professor's email if it's not given to us yet? \n\nYou can check [Directory](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/directory). However, it's not as good as expected. Some old professors aren't even listed here. \n\nAnother way you can find your professor's email address is by going to google and googling \"Hunter College __ department\". Each department has their own website. Look at their faculty list and there will be emails listed. \n\nIf you cannot find the email after searching it both ways, you can email that specific department and ask them for it. \n\n### Is blank course offered during  summer/winter semester?\n\nYou can use the teacher evaluation site to see what was previously offered. That does not guarantee a certain course will be offered again next summer/winter but it will definitely give you an idea. \n\n* Just go to: [Class Feedbacks](https://orapp.hunter.cuny.edu/ords/f?p=116:LOGIN::::::)\n* Search your course by professor name\n* Check what semesters the course was offered in. If the course has been offered for multiple continuous summers or winters it will probably be offered again. No guarantee but you can get an idea.\n\n###  I don't trust RateMyProf, is there another place to check professor ratings? \n\nAt the end of each semester students are asked to evaluate their professors using a number scale, you won't be able to see the messages they left their professor but you can see the number averages. It's not a mandatory thing to do and it's anonymous however, some professors offer extra credit if a certain percentage of the class does the evaluation. [Which can be found here!](https://orapp.hunter.cuny.edu/ords/f?p=116:LOGIN::::::)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; # Metrocards\n\n### Does Hunter offer programs like ASAP or ACE that give students free metrocard?\n\nNo, Hunter does not have ASAP nor ACE. [You can find here a list of schools that do](https://www1.cuny.edu/sites/asap/join-asap/)\n\n### How to get free/discounted metrocards?\n\nNYC has a FairFares program that offers half off for low income. [Check if you're eligible](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/fairfares/index.page)\n\nThere is also a program called CUNY EDGE that gives students free metrocard. Undergraduate students who receive cash assistance from HRA are eligible.",

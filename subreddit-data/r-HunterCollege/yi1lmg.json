If they\u2019ve earnestly supported you unconditionally no matter what you decided to pursue and have been there for you even through tough moments in an earnest way, then I think sitting through that ceremony so they can see that you\u2019re closer to success is worth going.\n\nOutside of that, If their treatment of you has been scuffed, then I say to skip on the ceremony and spend it with some friends",

I bet that they want to see you succeed and grow and the ceremony will that opportunity for them. Also I\u2019m pretty sure the ceremony happens in Downtown Brooklyn so there\u2019s bound to be something interesting to do to compensate for the rather milquetoast ceremony. I hope that this helps",

One day in robes, taking pictures with friends, it can be fun. For family, it's fun for them to try and spot you out in the crowd. After, your family will probably take you to eat.\n\nIf you actively disliked your time at Hunter, don't go. If you're indifferent and think you'd rather spend the day off, I'd push to say you should go.\n\nI went to the ceremony but never picked up my diploma.",

I didn't think it would be pragmatic for all of us to walk across the stage(although my friend from Queens College walked across the stage during her ceremony), but I was hoping to at least hear my name read from a list. We sat and listened to what seemed like a dozen speeches, and then our names appeared on a giant screen for a few moments. It felt like a waste of time.",

If you parents cannot go for any personal reason i would recommend going out w ur family (if possible) to eat and celebrate. Cause if u go to the ceremony n u see other taking pics w their families you will feel lonely and u should not feel that way during or after ur ceremony. Do whatever makes you feel good.",

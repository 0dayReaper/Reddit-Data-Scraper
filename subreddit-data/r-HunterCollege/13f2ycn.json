    "postText": "hi guys! i\u2019m really hoping that someone has insight on this matter: i am currently on academic probation and if i don\u2019t get my grades above a 2.0 this semester i\u2019ll be dismissed. i\u2019ve really tried to keep afloat this semester but it\u2019s been really hard due to financial and personal reasons. i was wondering if anyone has dealt with this at hunter before and what came of it/what you know and can tell me about appealing/ taking summer classes? i have already emailed an advisor and i\u2019m just waiting to hear back but i want to know what to expect in the meantime!!!! please help :,(",

            "comment": "Depends on what your definition of easy is. In my opinion, Applied Statistics is very different from Calculus. It's pretty much 100% word problems, so the class may focus more on how to interpret them, and the formulas to use. It may not be as straightforward as just giving you a function to find the limit of. I've never taken Matrix Algebra before, but it sounds like it would be more similar to Calculus. \n\nI like planning my classes so each class feels unique and the content is different enough for me to compartmentalize everything. If they're too similar, I have a fear that it'll all get jumbled in my head and I'll start to feel burned out. So, if you're anything like me, stat would be easier to take with calculus but that may not be the case for you. I hope that helps!",

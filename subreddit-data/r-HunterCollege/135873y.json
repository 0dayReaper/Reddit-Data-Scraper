Do you guys meet students from other schools as well (other CUNY\u2019s, Columbia, NYU, Barnard, PACE, etc.). I feel like everyone in high school knows each other, but I don\u2019t seem to see that with college students in nyc.",

So be that person who reaches out and starts the convo\n\nParties? I dunno not like drinking alcohol parties or frat parties but like end of year parties for some clubs and some programs\n\nI just know people from other schools through friends\n\nYeah NYC College is huge so ofc no one knows each other \n\nI will admit people straight up ignore me when I say hello or good morning but hey everyone\u2019s different\nI just hope you find your crowd",

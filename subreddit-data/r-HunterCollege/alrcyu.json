    "postText": "I used to use the west lounge by the escalators as a place to study/eat lunch/chill between classes... until about a year ago the chess players took it over. Now 99% of the time every chair is taken and they\u2019re blasting loud music and being obnoxious\u2014forcing me to eat lunch and do homework while sitting on the floor. \nI have no problem with chess I just don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t make a club and get a designated space instead of occupying the whole lounge area.. am I alone or do others share this frustration?\n",

I'm not sure where it was but it was next to the skybridge.  \n\n\nI thought it was pretty hilarious especially since it was merengue music and felt so out of place. I took it as a testament to how diverse Hunter really is but are they really everywhere?",

I have had to charge my phone there a few times and the kids playing there are always nice. One of the kids even sanitized the charging station surfaces in between games while I was there.\n\nThey practice Spanish and socialize. Is there something wrong with people making the most of their experience at Hunter and not deciding to limit it to club hours? They pay tuition like everyone else and they aren\u2019t in a designated quiet zone, so I can\u2019t see what the issue is. \n\n",

But screaming and playing blaring music from an external speaker is a bit inconsiderate to other students around them, even if it\u2019s not a quiet area. Using loud speakers in any enclosed public space is generally a dick move..\n\n I\u2019m sure they are nice people and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re total assholes or anything.. but I just wish they\u2019d decrease their noise, by maybe like half... or like 3 quarters haha.",

I come around sometimes, trying my best to bring positive attention and exposure to the club. \n\nI admit that we can be quite loud and obnoxious, although I think we try our best to be respectful, especially of people who want to play or learn chess. \n\nA lot of the noise now is generated by Dominos Club, not so much us, because we never blast Spanish music or hip-hop, and though we do obnoxiously yell sometimes, I would say the fault is on both sides.\n\nThat last comment about acquiring a room has been one of our main hindrances as a club. Plus, if anyone ever took issue with us taking up space or making noise, they certainly had the right to express it. Instead, Hunter students appear to have \u2018accepted\u2019 that this is the way things are now.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if it ever seems like we\u2019re imposing, but our presence there is no worse than the chaotic club right next to us.\n\nP.S. if anyone ever wants to learn chess, just let me know.",

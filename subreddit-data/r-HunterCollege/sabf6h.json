Hunter is super easy to navigate, each building has the floor numbers labeled, and there are posters with arrows that direct you to the west, east, and north buildings. The main building when you get off the train is west. That is where you will get your picture taken for your ID and where most people enter to get to wherever they need to go. I was nervous as well but it\u2019s really easy and there are signs and numbers all over the building to guide you!",

    "postText": "I had registered for MATH 100 for the fall 2023 semester to fit the CUNY common core requirement and I was wondering if anyone could give me an idea what kind of math it entails? Is it somewhat \"simple\"? Or is there is potentially a math course that is less slightly challenging that could also fit the requirement? I had taken the 101 algebra class before and did not do well so I'm a bit nervous going forward with taking this one.",

    "postText": "Since we\u2019re on break, I figured I\u2019d voice my concerns and issues with the 51st Dorms (Found Study Midtown East) to 1) Channel out my frustrations and 2) Make other future hawks who want/need student housing are aware of this when deciding on where they sign an agreement to.\n\nI\u2019m writing this from the perspective of someone who spent their freshmen year in Brookdale and 5 months and counting in 51st.\n\nThe 51st dorm can be summed up with one word: rushed. \n\nStarting with the actual room you are provided, the \u201crenovation\u201d job done on the rooms is laughable at best and concerning at worst. The walls were covered with a material that is no more than a glorified sticker. The result of the choice are walls that begun to peel when I moved in and only worsen exponentially as temperatures naturally fluctuate with the seasons. The few areas of the walls that were painted began to chip within the first month of living here. \n\nThe building is riddled to the brim with plumbing issues. I have to regularly put in work orders to fix issues like the toilet not flushing or the showerhead not letting out any semblance of water. The need to have reliable plumbing is more important in this dorm than in say Brookdale because at least at Brookdale, if there was an issue with one floor\u2019s bathroom you could go downstairs. At this dorm, you\u2019re basically at the whim of the porter and when they\u2019re finally able to get around to your room (no disrespect to the workers here. They\u2019ve been handed a hefty load that\u2019s begging for them to be swamped and overworked). \n\nOn the note of infrastructure that\u2019s broken in this dorm, the thermostat has been an unreliable mess mainly in the colder months. I could count the amount of days I\u2019ve had proper heating on one of my fingers. Work orders have been put in and they claim to resolve it, but usually after I attempt to turn up the heat, it immediately falls flat on its face.\n\nThe lighting situation for the dorm is pitiful. If you live here, you will either face a cinder block wall that blocks all amounts of sunlight from entering or a corporate building that blocks most of your sunlight. To add insult to injury the only light source for the entire dorm is so poorly located (by the entrance to your room) which essentially means you will live in some amount of darkness or dinginess if you don\u2019t buy a supplemental light source. \n\nThe dorm provided mini fridge is microscopic especially when you consider that you will be living here with a roommate if you apply through Hunter unless you\u2019re aggressively lucky. I bring this point up because you\u2019re strictly prohibited from bringing your own mini fridge and they do routine checks (I\u2019ve had 2 done so far) to ensure your in compliance of this rule. Unless you want to become dependent on outside food you will need to store your food in the communal fridge and that has its own issues (more on that in a moment). \n\nThere\u2019s only 1 communal kitchen for the entire building located on the first floor and only contains 9 sets of burners and ovens. Considering that this building has 18 floors that can house up to 100 students/interns on each floor, you can see where issues can arise. The kitchen can very much become a stampede if you\u2019re even capable of getting a stove. Because of the amount of people passing through, the kitchen is often egregiously unsanitary. The dorm has a problem of people stealing from the communal fridge which is just worsened by the fact that everyone is just another fly on the wall. At least with Brookdale, there was a higher sense of accountability because the kitchen was divided by floor. There is an option to get a deluxe room which comes with a kitchenette, but it\u2019s usually very poorly positioned with the kitchenette being on the opposite end of the room as the window. Along with the lack of additional ventilation, the result is a room that will reek of what you make in it. And this doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that the deluxe costs an additional 1K a year.\n\nThe location of the dorm is susceptible to a ton of traffic due to how centrally located it is. The result is that you often need to hear cars blaring their horn from 8AM up until 9PM or so. Along with being loaded with noise pollution, the area is far more expensive to live in than Kips Bay (the neighborhood Brookdale is in) both in groceries and takeout restaurants.\n\nIn general, the experience of living here is steeply unpleasant and it hurts more when you consider the higher price tag. While Brookdale is an older facility with its issues, it is far more effective at handling its issues. 51st feels like a perpetual cycle of poor decision when designing the facility that makes makes it more of nightmare to remedy.\n\nObviously, this is just my experience with the dorm. I\u2019m just here to voice my experience. If anyone has more questions, just ask and I\u2019ll get back to this when I can.",

And then I heard about the kitchen\u2026 WHAT?? I was so mad about not being offered a Brookdale dorm again and only a midtown one. I had to decline cause it was too steep of a price. I was a little jealous when I first saw pictures. But then I heard about the kitchen and thought \u201cok maybe I\u2019m not that jealous.\u201d And now your story has made me very happy with commuting for hours as much as it sucks.",

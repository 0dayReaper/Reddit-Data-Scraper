From the subjects/majors you are slightly interested, to the classes you think you won't explore outside/after college, to the very things you're absolutely interested in. Browse the majors catalog. I think around end of sophomore/ beginning of junior you will need to pick a major. Even then after having chosen a major, it's not the end of the world if you end up not liking your major. You can always change it, hopefully you don't wait too long. Keep evaluating if it's for you. Talk to profs, talk to classmates, talk to people in the major (hopefully you find people who are enthusiastic about their majors who can actually talk about it with details). And then later on, if you're about to graduate and start thinking about changing your major, honestly just finish the major and at least have a degree under your belt (unless you really can't stand it &amp; it's making you absolutely miserable). Good luck, don't stress, your job is to keep looking/exploring rn, do things at your own pace, have fun &amp; enjoy :)",

I have friends who studied psychology and philosophy and ended up working in a complete different field. Just take your time and make sure you don't keep on changing your major each semester.",

Like deciding whether you want to go into medical, tech, business, or liberal arts. Then, you should research different positions in the field and see what fits you. I certainly dont love my profession but I can live w it. Like the pay, hours, working environment are all decent imo. You can explore different positions through the occupational outlook handbook.",

It's actually been approved for awhile, saying \"Needs to finish pending work\" but I didn't get any email about the status. In any case I'm wondering when I will hear about tickets, RSVP etc. Anyone know?",

The commencement committee will email you, a bit before the graduation on tickets, pictures, and where to buy the cap + gown.",

The content is hard no matter where you get your CS degree, and every school has their own set of weed out classes too. You'll never hear people who did just fine in a class shout about how just fine their experience was, you'll always hear from people who failed the class about how hard and unfair the class was. \n\nI think if you treat your classes with the appropriate respect, and make sure that you never leave lecture feeling like \"what the fuck just happened\" (and if you do leave feeling like that, talk to your friends or hit up office hours ASAP because every lecture depends on the prior one), you'll do more than fine. Speaking as a current junior at Hunter studying CS and music.",

It\u2019s not even \u201cself taught\u201d it\u2019s self google, they explain nothing but write out in the board half of the problem expecting you to know how to solve it, i wouldn\u2019t, i would\u2019ve stayed in lehman if i could..",

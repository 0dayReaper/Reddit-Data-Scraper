I know this question might sound a bit dumb, but I honestly have searched the entire internet and have found no answers to my question, so I thought I\u2019d ask it here, to see if anyone knows. But yeah, I\u2019ve been wanting to know what AWST means in the student groups sections on degree works, just so I can understand my stuff better. It mean a lot if someone know or could answer. Thanks!!",

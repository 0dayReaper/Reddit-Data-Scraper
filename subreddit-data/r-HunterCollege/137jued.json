From what I know, it doesn\u2019t effect your FAFSA, just it can if you do it consistently throughout the years so dont make it a habit!",

You can pull now.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\n\n*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",

Your just expected to pay the difference remaining. This all depends on how much aid your getting. (I\u2019m poor so I get full aid but I\u2019m still expected to pay around $200 for this summer).",

I have some family members who said they wanted to come last minute so I just put in a request for additional tickets, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll get them in time since it says they\u2019re not guaranteed :\u2019) \n\nOr \n\nFor anyone who has additional tickets they won\u2019t be using: would you be willing to transfer them to me?",

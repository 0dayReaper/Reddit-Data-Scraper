If CC is not really your style though you can use the [cuny global search](https://globalsearch.cuny.edu) website to look at bio profs from John Jay, Baruch and Brooklyn\u2019s courses. (I only say those colleges specifically because that\u2019s where the hunter bio department prevents us from epermitting) Just look for professor reviews or syllabi online. Best of luck finding your classes!",

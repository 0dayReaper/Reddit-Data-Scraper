    "postText": "(20F) Hello I'm worried about the shared bathroom, no control over room temperature, no AC, roaches/rat, cleanliness of kitchen, general functioning of the building since I heard laundry room is closed often, etc. Is there a social environment? Do u get complaints easily when having friends over w music?\n\nAlso, is the gym open only for athletes? Does it have variety of equipment or just cardio stuff?\n\nThank u :D",

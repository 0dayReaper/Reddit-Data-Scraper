However, when I try to register for the course, I am getting an error that says I haven\u2019t taken the prerequisite (microeconomics 1). I have taken this course at my home college, and I\u2019m not sure why hunter can\u2019t see that in cuny first. I have tried emailing and calling the hunter Econ department, and I cannot get anyone to get back to me. I really want to take this course, but I\u2019m not sure what to do at this point. Any ideas?",

Give them 24-72 hours to reply. If no response by then, send a follow up email.",

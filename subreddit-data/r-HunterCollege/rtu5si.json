Job growth? Salary? Major relevance to their job?\n\nI am just really scared with how the pandemic is and how expensive buying a house is and I want to be more well equipped because once one leaves college, they are on their own. Thanks in advance.",

If you are studying nursing, then hunter is good. \nYou can search the annual average salary for a registered nurse in NYC. \nYou need to save money and be wise if you want buy a house. Experience is also important before applying for the job. There is a thread for nursing in reedit. You can always ask there for greater insights. \nJust get through the program first. \nI heard it\u2019s quite competitive to get admitted and the program is hard. Good luck and study hard !",

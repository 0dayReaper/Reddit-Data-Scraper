            "comment": "You must have already chosen your classes, but\u2026 I\u2019m still responding. Here\u2019s my list. The catch is that my classes were virtual during the pandemic &amp; workload was slashed (as opposed to the load in person profs said). Prepare to read\u2026\u2026. it's super long sorry, but I felt like it .....\r  \n \r  \nFavs:\r  \n(1) Carlos Padron - Psychodynamic Seminar Elective\r  \nWorkload: Midterm, Final, Presentation on 1 reading, Optional Blackboard posts, Gives extensions when asked ahead of time\r  \nMUST TAKE. Prof provides detailed vignettes of his clients to demonstrate concepts. Vibe is like effective supervision, especially when students ask for advice. Material is difficult to read but he doesn\u2019t expect you to understand it all, goes over concepts thoroughly. Makes someone who has trouble keeping up with readings want to read &amp; look forward to class. Saw this prof during common time (an all-day event full of workshops existed before the pandemic) during my BSW. I ended up recognizing his name - best class I\u2019ve ever taken in my life.\r  \n \r  \n(2) Joanne Rizzi - Family Treatment Elective (I took her for the summer tho)\r  \nWorkload: 3pg paper on \u201cwhat family is to you\u201d, Final (1pg genogram, 5-6pg analysis/continuation with family paper with theory; not as bad as it sounds, there\u2019s a lot to write), 1 Blackboard post on a book you have to read (get started on that quick), Group Presentation (on theory + 1pg on the group's collab).   \nPapers, as she says, is not academically difficult with research and stuff, but can be mentally difficult to manage family stuff into a paper. Found this class useful for studying for the LMSW. She does lecture slides, my fav format of class, encourages participation. Slides were not boring to me, especially when classmates share their thoughts. If this still doesn\u2019t convince you, prof says no matter what kind of client you work with, they all have family (that is the client at times) or networks/groups of people related to them. The theories are interesting. Btw, takes a while returning papers, but leaves thoughtful comments throughout paper for me.\r  \n \r  \n(3) Daniel Gardner - Clinicals\r  \nWorkload: Midterm, Final, Case Study Presentations, Optional Blackboard posts on readings, 1 Exam, Gives extensions when asked ahead of time\r  \nThe class is run by lecture slides in one half, 2 students signed up for case presentations in the other half. He encourages questions and participation during slides, otherwise the slides will be really boring. But for me, I like lecture slides format of class. Case presentations are always interesting - Gets everyone sharing about their experiences/insecurities with clients. Takes a while returning grades, but that\u2019s not the important thing here, easy A.\r  \n \r  \n(4) Stuart Kaufer - Human Behavior III\r  \nWorkload: 1 Final Paper (on a book you have to read), Group project (Case Presentation; he decides on groups), Weekly 10 question Blackboard quizzes (can take up to 3xs), 4 Blackboard Posts (Must comment on 1 other student\u2019s post), Gives extensions when asked ahead of time\r  \nYeah, a lot of work, but easy A so long as you do the work and show up. \r  \nPros: Extremely thorough with concepts and dsm5 - I approve &amp; is helpful for studying for LMSW\r  \nCons: Cams must be on, no food (snacks allowed), 100% of your attention, calls on people sometimes, so you must read as much of the reading as you can!!!\r  \nOverall: He\u2019s scary/strict but nice &amp; funny. He was generous with grading my stuff so. I\u2019m scared bc of participation - my weakness. If you participate, you have no problem. My head hurts after his class. He\u2019s more lax towards the end of the semester. He\u2019s great for human behavior, please avoid for professional seminar (not helpful or knowledgeable towards people\u2019s topics, class is a waste of time hearing everybody\u2019s ideas). \r  \n \r  \n(5) Paul Kurzman - Professional Seminar\r  \nGives structure to how to view this huge 15-18pg exit research paper. Fluid with topics, helps organize/structure your paper, full of suggestions. Doesn\u2019t do it the traditional professional seminar way. You can do any topic of your interest and make it your own. By making it your own: instead of papers, people have done plays, videos, etc. (Of course the creative project topic still has to do with sw, and that the topic would need more research, resources, or change can/should be applied today for you to escape the paper, which can be harder than the paper). Generous grader. Meets twice a month. Rec 100%.\r  \n \r  \n(6) Richard Siegel - Health Care Policy\r  \nWorkload: Midterm, Final, 5 Blackboard Posts (Must provide sources each post :o and comment on 2 other student\u2019s posts, sources not needed for comments), Group Project Presentation (easiest item on the workload; groups determined by topic interest)\r  \nChallenging course for me - material wise, paper wise, workload wise, participation wise. Pro: Gives extensions when asked ahead of time. Generous grader so long as you do the work and make the effort. Overall: I still rec the class bc Prof provides a good foundation for subject. Class is pretty much all participation first half, lecture slides other half. Caring prof &amp; shares his experiences from working in the hospital. The field aint easy.\r  \n \r  \n(7) Keith Chan - Research \r  \nHonestly, I\u2019m recommending bc it was an easy A\u2026 we did not have any papers bc of the pandemic. Pro: Understanding prof, passes you if you do the work period. He emphasizes that he's not the type to fail students on the most part. Available for office hours &amp; questions after class, gets to all questions. Con: Research is so boring. SO. BORING. But! Overall: He\u2019s really interested in his slides, provides somewhat fun examples, updates on his work in policy/research (this is pretty fun), encourages participation, wants you to learn. That helps.\n\n\r \r  \nLeast Fav: Catherine Thurston - Aging Policy\r  \nWorkload: 1 Policy Brief Paper, 1 Infographic (Flyer or vid), 1 Blackboard Post on a YouTube video\r  \nTo be fair, she has a few good lectures, read from her notes straight through, wants questions at the end. Most classes, she invited speakers, who just talked about their organizations for the most part, a few felt irrelevant to class &amp; material in my opinion. Not available for office hours (teaches many classes). When asked about the policy brief, didn\u2019t provide examples, referred to syllabus and answered questions with \u201cit\u2019s okay with me\u201d (vague answer) or \u201cdepends on the topic\u201d. This was my memory of her. She\u2019s okay though, if you do your work and participate, then you\u2019ll get a good grade. Manageable workload.",

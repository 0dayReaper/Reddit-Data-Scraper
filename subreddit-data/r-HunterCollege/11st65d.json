The school does offer a few programs / seminars to help finding internships and stuff, and i get bi-weekly emails with opportunities here and there, but we're talking maybe 20-50 internships a semester (and that's being generous) split between something like 400+ people at least. At the end of the day yes, it's doable here, but it's harder than at other places, and if you have other options I would not go here for Comp Sci.",

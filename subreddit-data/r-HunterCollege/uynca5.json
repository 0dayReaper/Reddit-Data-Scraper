    "postText": "So I'm an upcoming freshman Fall 2022 and I just checked CUNYFIRST and it seems I have been placed in Math 101. Apparently it is a course for College Algebra but the thing is I'm planning to do Computer Science and the prereqs/coreqs for CSI 127 is Math 121, 125, or 150. \n\nSo I have 3 options essentially from the guide they gave me. \n\n* 1st is to take the Math Placement Exam to reevaluate my placement and hope I get placed into Level 1+\n* 2nd is to appeal with documents of regents, transcripts, and AP. Does SAT count btw? (I got a 700 or 720 if that counts)\n* 3rd is to take Math 101 over the summer (Is that even possible? If so where?) or take CLEP (earn credit of the course)\n\n\\- My orientation is also on June 9 so I'm also wondering if that will impact my selection of math courses. \n\nThank you.\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be appreciated.",

            "comment": " i would suggest you take the placement exam because that's the easiest and quickest way to resolve the issue. \n\nit doesn't matter what you plan on majoring in, algebra is the basic pre req for the other math courses. \n\nif you don't do so swell on the placement exam then you can use documents to appeal their decision. \n\ni would suggest you take the placement exam soon since the results come out instantly so it doesn't affect you when you go to orientation. if you take it after orientation.. they will first put you in math 101 until you have proof/clearance to take another math course which can delay your math enrollment - other classes might also fill during that time.",

I only did up to trig in school because they didn't offer calc/precalc to me. \n\nAlso what do you think the chances of appealing is? I took algebra 1/2, geometry, and trig. However I never took the geometry and trig regents because it was waived. Do you think they will consider the SAT math section? It has alot of algebra in it.\n\nThank you.",

If you took those classes, the placement test is a complete piece of cake anyways. Like the above commenter said, try taking it prior to orientation. the scores are automatic and you can register for whatever course you qualify for afterwords instead of appealing. if you don\u2019t manage to get it(again, with the classes you\u2019ve taken it\u2019s really easy), show them your transcripts and make an appeal. \n\nas for is it possible to take math 10100 over the summer, i honestly have no idea. the math department website says the course offerings.\n\nas for SAT\u2019s, i don\u2019t think that they specifically count as a \u201cdocument\u201d, but that score should definitely help your case in the event you would need to appeal.",

If possible maybe I can try to get to Level 2 to take (Calc). \n\nI saw your message a little bit late so I already appealed and registered for Math placement exam for next Friday remote. Apparently it says you can't use scrap paper? Is that true?\n\nAnyways, I also found out you can do a Level 1 interactive workshop (24 hours) and if I do well on it, I can appeal and mention that I took the workshop, so I'm currently doing that as well.",

It\u2019s going to be you and other students, so they have to proctor you all to make sure you\u2019re not cheating, so instead of having to flash scrap paper, they make you kind of whiteboard the entire screen, like you use your mouse (or screen for a tablet, recommend a desktop though) and you have to work the problems out directly onto the screen. \nAlso yeah the workshop is a really good contingency just in case. As I mentioned before, the placement is really easy. When you enroll into the exam, like a few days before they give you practice problems on Blackboard, and those are the same types of questions you\u2019re going to have on the exam so you can prepare. \n\nGood luck!",

You can either take the MPT to get to Level 1 or you can appeal. There is a third option you can do as well which is take the Level 1 interactive workshop (24 hours) and if you mention that you took it in the appeal email, you can get it raised to Level 1.

Just log in to blackboard and read the announcement. \n\nwww.tinyurl.com/hcpreplevel1\n\nIt's really easy to set up. You just have pass the online tests with 90% averages and pass the written assignments with 80% average. Really simple if you just grind for 5 days.",

However, that status of Complete means Hunter\u2019s placement center has completed their review and placed you into Math 10100. And that means you\u2019ll be REGISTERING for Math 10100 course for the upcoming fall. If you don\u2019t want to be placed in this course and want to be placed into Math 12100, 12500, or 15000, then you MUST take the placement test. \n\nThe Academic Advising hold will be automatically removed once you attended the orientation.",

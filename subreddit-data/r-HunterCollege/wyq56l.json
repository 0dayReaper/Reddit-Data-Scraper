They do participation through iclickers. Majority of them dont require attendance for a class that size however it\u2019s best to go thru the syllabus and see what is being graded",

It was a Tu/Fri class, and a lot of people started skipping on Friday, so he said he might do pop quizzes on that day to \"encourage\" attendance.\n\nThe course had TAs, who might've done a head count, but I don't recall seeing any of them do it.",

            "comment": "There\u2019s really no trick to it. It\u2019s a matter of being organized and fully prioritizing course work over everything else. Now, not everyone can do that as some have family and work responsibilities that they have to balance with school. Those are legitimate responsibilities to prioritize and parameters to work in. Hours spent on Nintendo and TikTok are not. Otherwise, it\u2019s really just being organized, from end to end. Do summer and winter courses but plan schedules with a balance of courses at different difficulty levels. Hunter accepts a few CLEP exams for credit, so see if those can give you a boost. Use epermit where it makes sense for you. Stay on top of your workload because falling behind is the devil. Don\u2019t wait for due dates to start assignments - ever! Estimate how long it will take to do an assignment properly and plan accordingly. Always plan to have assignments done at least one day early. And most of all, coursework comes first - time for all that other stuff if coursework is done. If not - oh well - it will be there later too - don\u2019t fall into the fomo trap.  Lastly, be your own advocate. Read and research everything about your program requirements so you\u2019re not solely dependent on your advisor. If they tell you something that seems strange or inconsistent, ask them where you can find the policy \u201cfor your own reference.\u201d",

    "postText": "I sing but don\u2019t ever have the chance to because I live in an apt, I don\u2019t want to annoy neighbors or my roommates. &amp; I don\u2019t like to sing in front of other people anyway so I can\u2019t just sing wherever. Is there anywhere in hunter that would be a good place for me to sing, where I\u2019m not disrupting anyone, has good acoustics, and can be alone? Or is there a certain time, like at night or something where I\u2019d be allowed to sing somewhere? Like even in a staircase where people don\u2019t usually go but I\u2019d be able to sing as loud as I want? &amp; is there a certain time you can\u2019t be at hunter?",

            "comment": "There are practice rooms at the 4th floor of Hunter North. Directly across the elevators there should be giant doors with flyers from the music department and how to sign up for a practice room. Go through these doors and you\u2019ll see a bunch of little rooms for students to practice music in. \n\nThese rooms are meant for music majors, music minors, or non-majors taking a music class, and the sign up period to reserve these rooms has long passed now too. But some of the rooms have a schedule taped next to them, and if there\u2019s no one inside, and there\u2019s no name under the reservation then it\u2019s free to use. These rooms may be a little stuffy or hot, but there\u2019s good acoustics. \n\nPlease don\u2019t be shy when it comes to using this space. I\u2019ve book a reservation to use one of the rooms once a week this semester and there\u2019s a lot of unused rooms. I\u2019ve even seen people who use the rooms to attend their zoom class, or just be on their phone. I hope that helped!",

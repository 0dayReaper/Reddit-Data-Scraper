Now I'm verifying my FAFSA but when I go to the Additional Info: SEEK Freshman Income Information Request 2022-2023 section I do not see the form that I have to fill out. I went on the school website to see if I can find it but I don't see it. I also sent an email asking for help but no one responded. Has anyone done this already? If so how did you do it?",

You just have to scan your tax return from the year 2020 and submit the pdf file. I was confused about that as well but I asked the college advisor at my school and she told me to upload that.",

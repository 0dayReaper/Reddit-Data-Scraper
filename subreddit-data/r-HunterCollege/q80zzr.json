    "postText": "Hello! We're a NY-based tutoring company looking for language tutors. Hunter students would be able to work close to the uni and have a super flexible schedule. However, we welcome anyone who lives near Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn as well. The salary is competitive for a part-time job ($30-50/hour). I'll link a flyer on here, but please feel free to DM me about this opportunity :).\n\nFlyer: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zGs7bUYvJyQtfviGOvRWE5pWOIdUPTrf/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zGs7bUYvJyQtfviGOvRWE5pWOIdUPTrf/view?usp=sharing)\n\nApplication Link: [https://tribecalanguage.teachworks.com/form/teachers](https://tribecalanguage.teachworks.com/form/teachers)",

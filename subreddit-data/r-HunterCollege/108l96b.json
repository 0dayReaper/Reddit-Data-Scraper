    "postText": "I have a GPA of 2.98 and the minimum GPA requirement is a 3.0\n\nMy work experience is great and so are my recommendations, but I'm just afraid that my GPA will prevent me from being accepted into the program. I have a ton of anxiety about submitting my application. (For a Master's in Mental Health Counseling). Has any grad student got in with less or about the same?",

Take some courses to boost your GPA, a good letter of recommendation from a higher position that\u2019s related to mental health counseling, if they don\u2019t provide a chance for you to explain why your GPA isn\u2019t high, maybe incorporate a small portion of it into whatever personal essay they ask on the application. Set an appt with the Dean for the mental health counseling to discuss options &amp; try getting an interview with them !",

Mostly used for students who graduated already but need extra classes to improve GPA and grades",

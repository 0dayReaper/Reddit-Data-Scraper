I haven\u2019t had my orientation yet (but it is soon). I also checked the schedule builder and none of my classes are the ones I wanted (i didn\u2019t get calc or intro to cs). Is it too late to change my lc? Can I talk or email anyone about this on such a short notice?",

Your math class is determined by your math milestone (assigned based off hs math) or you can take the math placement exam to override milestone.",

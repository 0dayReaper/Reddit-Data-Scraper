    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy first choice for an MSW is the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College, and I'm feeling discouraged because based on everything I've read online, when it comes to social work schools in NYC, Hunter is one of the hardest to get in to (maybe even more than Columbia and NYU, because of how cheap it is). I don't have a BSW; I went to Columbia, where I majored in Computer Science. My GPA was 3.43. I didn't take any social work/psychology classes in college. The only things I did which I think would be semi-applicable include being on the e-board of a cultural club at school and taking some ethnic studies classes. I am a first-generation, low-income college student.\n\nMy current job is software engineering (not related to social work at all). And since graduating, I've started volunteering at two nonprofit organizations in NYC. By the time I apply to the MSW, I will have more than a year of experience as a volunteer for an organization helping low-income Asian/immigrant youth in NYC, and another organization helping survivors of gender-based violence in NYC.\n\nDo you all have any advice for how to make myself more competitive on my MSW application, other than the volunteering that I'm already doing? And do you think I have a good chance of getting in, with my stats and all (I know that's a very hard question for someone to answer, but if you yourself have gotten into an MSW program, I want to know what your impression of my chances is)?\n\nThanks everyone &lt;3",

            "comment": "Hi there, I'm a MSW Fall 21' graduate from Silberman.   \n\n\nWhile I was in the Adv Standing, our classes were mixed with all the other MSW programs, OYR's, the regular 2-year's pathways. I've had older classmates switch completely different fields, fields like business or computer science, with little to no experience in social work.   \n\n\nWhen I was BSW, I don't know when the rumors started, either from classmates or the info sessions themselves, the buzz words were constantly \"extremely competitive\", \"hard to get in\", \"they're looking for the best of the best, the ones with experience\". Even BSW's felt discouraged to even apply, as some were just interns (where some of us didn't get to do much at our internships; Not that we didn't do anything. It's just how can someone who only had friendly visiting home visit responsibilities compare to people who had larger/ more serious casework responsibilities).  \n\n\nWith all of this being said, I'm not trying to say it's easy to get in either. Honestly, I have no idea how they choose applicants and your probability of getting in. But I completely feel your discouragement, despite our different positions. My BSW really didn't feel like it amounted to much compared to my fellow older BSW classmates, who had a lot of life experience, and knew how to sell themselves. I was also a first gen, low income college student, no connections. I almost didn't get in, but I appealed my decision after a long back and forth and here I am, graduated with an MSW.   \n\n\nSorry for the lengthy response. But my advice to you is to go for it and apply. Give yourself that chance. Speak with social workers within the organizations you are volunteering. Figure out what social work means to them and what it means to you. Idk if my approach is the correct approach, but focus on you, your story, the messages/values you learned growing up in relation to the type of work of social work (based off of your volunteering or anything else), pick some themes (low income, language barrier, any populations you are drawn to, maybe it's all of them, mention it all, any specific topic like justice for a certain population, etc.). To applicants like you, they may ask why you decided to switch, why social work, what it means to you. Make it about you, who you are, the kind of social worker you would want to be (even if you have never encountered one, know what it means to be one, just use your imagination) (obviously not wild, random imagination, but some kind of vision for yourself, if possible). Find your narrative, be concise, stick with it for your application/interview. I truly believe that will make anyone shine. Take that step to apply, what do you have to lose. Feel free to reach out if anything\\~",

I have no social work experience and got my bachelors last year. I think what really matters is (1) demonstrated and clearly articulating what your passion and mission is and (2) what you\u2019ll bring to the program I.e. your lived experience and how they shape your vision, goals, approach, skills, and how that will contribute to social impact. I was accepted without the group interview part, but I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s pretty chill and they just want to hear your motivations and how you approach things.\n\n\nBtw I\u2019m also first gen and Asian! I\u2019d be glad to listen as a soundboard and review your statement of purpose.",

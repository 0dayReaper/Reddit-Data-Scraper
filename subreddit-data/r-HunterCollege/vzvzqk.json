If you have pending fin aid just pay the difference that isnt covered. If your pending aid is higher than tuition charge you dont have to pay anything. If you go to fin acc you should see total due on the right side thats the amt you owe.",

Because I was waiting for my Tap to kick in but it still says pending and it will cover the whole thing. But im kinda paranoid that they will drop my classes because I didn't pay",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I am finishing up pre preqs this semester to apply to the nursing program - I went to a general info session last semester and was told by them and my advisor B- are accepted but GPA still needs to be high and at least a 3.2.\n\nNow, I just went to another info session for a separate question but they say they don't take B- anymore?\n\nDo you guys think I still have a shot at applying? It is my only b in general on my whole transcript and I heard people say that they had low GPA but a decent PAX and got accepted.\n\nWhat should I do? They just changed the whole criteria for acceptance by that.",

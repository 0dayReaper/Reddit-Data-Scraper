    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019ve been accepted to hunter, and being a current senior who was accepted, all I want to know is what other people's experiences have been like. I have to commit to a school in a few days, and Hunter is one of my choices, but I'm not sure whether I'm making the best decision. I know I should make my own decisions, but I simply want to have an idea of how you guys feel about Hunter. If I'm being completely honest, there are times when thinking about Hunter makes me happy, and then there are other times when it makes me sad \ud83d\ude2d (no joke). Back in September, I had no intention of committing to Hunter, but the majority of my reach schools either rejected me or placed me on a waitlist. I recently received a waitlist notice from Macaulay, so I'm unsure of what to do. I'm worried that it\u2019ll be difficult to make friends at Hunter because it's a commuter school. Additionally, I don't hear much about parties at Hunter, which is understandably not a terrible thing, but I think that's a fun thing to experience while in college. I really wished I had other choices, but I don\u2019t want to regret the fact that I had to take out loans. The only thing that is making me a bit happy is just thinking about graduate school. Although I wasn\u2019t accepted to schools I wanted to attend for undergrad, I could start over and reapply to them for graduate school. Anyways, how\u2019s been your experience at hunter? Did you felt the same way as me when you were a senior? How are the classes there?",

I found it pretty easy to make friends in my first semester because of the learning communities, and I\u2019m still friends with those people. But, don\u2019t be surprised if you have to speak first to make friends. People won\u2019t approach you first, but I haven\u2019t come across anyone who\u2019s genuinely rude or mean. The classes here are fine, all of mine have been nice and understanding. Biggest downsides to hunter imo is that it can be annoying/difficult to make a schedule because classes fill quickly and the school gets ridiculously crowded at 12. But overall I don\u2019t regret going to Hunter.",

All I can say is if you're the type of person who\u2019s willing to dedicate their time to working on assignments and work a bit harder on assignments that require it, you'll be fine. And if you're okay with talking to people first and making the effort to make friends, you'll be fine.

With hunter you really have to put yourself out there to make friends, they do have a new club or meeting every week in which you can make friends in (i have 3 and that\u2019s all i need tbh), everyone else will only really be acquaintances for classes. Is it better than lehman, yes? is it way more competitive and you have to get your shit done as soon as possible or someone will take your spot in whatever you apply to (even classes), also yes. in my experience i like the school",

And its really up to you to make friends. I joined a club and made friends there, I made semester friends in each class (each semester I would make new totally different friends to hang with). I used students as resources to find out info on how to do things at Hunter. It depends on how you look at it.... I learned everything I needed to know to get through the bureaucracy of Hunter College through making friends in my classes and got some good tips on surviving. I am not particularly extroverted, I am also anti social, but I definitely made an effort to make friends. There are no parties at Hunter but I got my kick out of college parties by hanging around Marymount which is only a few blocks down (I had a single friend prior to college going there). For the education, Hunter is great. For friends, you definitely have to try harder and make an honest effort. I have stayed in contact with two friends after college. Bottom line, if you want to socialize, then socialize!!!! Just don't make expectations too high or put too much focus on making only the bestest friends and enjoy the ride.",

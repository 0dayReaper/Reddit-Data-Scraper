They present you the info and it\u2019s up to you to learn it. With that, I\u2019d say I\u2019ve had pretty fair and considerate professors who\u2019ve done well w presenting the material and helping us to learn it. However, every department in Hunter has its type of prof, the psych dep has fairly well professors from experience, not so sure about the others. I\u2019ve heard that science is a competitive subject and it\u2019s a lot of self-teaching. All depends on your major and asking around about profs and learning who to avoid from others experiences.",

It\u2019s a lot of self-teaching, and there\u2019s a ton of stress and moments where you\u2019re just so tired only to get a C+ for a class you worked your ass off for. I\u2019m not saying science-related majors won\u2019t make you work hard, that\u2019s their purpose, but the professors take pride in \u201cweeding out\u201d the weak here.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s all bad, either. You form bonds with the students because you\u2019re all suffering the same thing so there\u2019s a lot of study groups and stuff. The TAs are great, and the teachers are genuine. It\u2019s just their teaching methods that don\u2019t mesh well. Example: Chem is a flipped method, where you watch a ton of videos, take notes, and have a ton of homework due every Thursday for 2 topics (18 topics in total). Then, on lecture day, you go through Clicker sessions. This is my experience with Kobko. If you choose another chem prof, it might be a different story.\n\nWhatever you decide, congratulations on getting accepted and graduating this year!",

            "comment": "In all honesty, it rlly depends on your major. i am going for chemistry so i don\u2019t know about the other departments, but the science department here is not the best. math and science in general are competitive subjects, but they make it so much more difficult then it actually is, and some of the professors do the bare minimum. if you are planning on majoring in anything science related be prepared for a lot of studying and a lot of self teaching. however don\u2019t let this scare you, everywhere you go you are always going to encounter good and bad professors and sometimes you can\u2019t avoid bad ones because they might be the only one available for a course you need, you just have to learn to manage your time with it. i hope this helps, by the way congratulations on your acceptance!",

            "comment": "I just had my first semester and I\u2019d say it was pretty good. Although, disclaimer I was out with an injury for about half the semester (so I got to work completely remotely) and this is the only college experience I\u2019ve had so far (thus my answer comes without comparison to anything exactly relevant). \n\nFirst off, like others have pointed out, the college experience IS different from high school. There\u2019s a lot less hand holding and a lot more independence. You are expected, in many cases, to teach yourself. I\u2019m not saying they aren\u2019t going to give you any instruction, but you will likely have readings assigned that are designed to give you information that can\u2019t be covered in class. I think that was the major difference I noticed; in high school if you skipped assigned chapter readings, any material you would be tested on and/or be expected to know would be covered in class, in college there are things that might not be covered explicitly in class. \n\nI liked my first semester far more than I liked my two years of high school (I only did 9 and 10th grade before getting my TASC/HSE/GED. I came from a semester of homeschooling (last half of 10th grade) after having a shitty teacher in high school crap on me. So I came in having recent experience with self instruction and I have always been one to like light instruction then the freedom to do stuff my own way and at my own pace. [just want to be clear and make potential sources for bias in my answer known].\n\nIf you\u2019re asking about professors, then I\u2019d agree with everyone else. There are some great ones, some okay ones, some bad ones, and everything in between (as you\u2019ll find anywhere). However, another difference from high school is it\u2019s up to you what you want to tolerate. If you choose to take Rate My Professor (or any other) reviews about an instructor to heart, then you can likely pass on a class with a poorly rated professor and take it later. That said, my advice would be to take each review with a grain of salt and keep certain things in mind that you find important in a professor when reading them. For me, I\u2019ve a list of some things that if I see in any review I run the other way (for example, if an English professor has been said to stifle creativity by enforcing a certain mindset/answer and/or punishes original thinking I am going to avoid them at all costs). Additionally, many reviewers will review because they are either very pleased with their experience OR they had a terrible one (which is likely a more common reason to review as I\u2019ve found). You very likely aren\u2019t going to hear from the people that had an OK experience. \n\nI ended up with mostly decent professors this past semester which I\u2019m sure helped me see the school more positively. That said, I also got a bad one that was so nitpicky with answers and marked you wrong if you didn\u2019t write exactly what she had in her own notes (and this was a Women and Gender Studies class \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). \n\nI think the location is great; taking a stroll in the park during a gap between classes is quite refreshing. I think the buildings are pretty standard (they definitely aren\u2019t the nicest, but they aren\u2019t totally dilapidated either). Most of the elevators are broken at some point though, so unless you\u2019re headed to a high floor, I\u2019d take the stairs or the escalators. The classrooms felt a little cramped (but I had yet to be in a bigger lecture hall). There are limited places to sit between classes, although there is a sort of floor culture so no one would judge you for sitting down along a wall somewhere. From what I knew the cafeteria was closed and the only food on campus was from vending machines and a small cafe near the cafeteria. I never tried it though. \n\nFinally, it is a commuter school and it shows. It will take quite a bit of effort to make lasting friendships. A lot of people go in for classes and then leave. That was one thing I wish I had listened to a little more. While I don\u2019t mind it (I\u2019m probably one of the most introverted people on the planet and my social anxiety doesn\u2019t help), and I\u2019m still just a freshman, if you\u2019re looking to go somewhere that guarantees you can have a vibrant college social life, Hunter probably isn\u2019t for you. \n\nIf you want to DM me with any specific questions, want to know more about my personal experience, and/or if you end up coming to hunter and want a friendly acquaintance I\u2019d be happy to chat with you. I wish you the best and congratulations on getting accepted to Hunter!\n\n(Sorry for the long reply)",

College isn't easy, you have to put in the work, and really drive yourself to finish what you started. Also like others stated it depends on the department, and in the end, it's up to you to choose.",

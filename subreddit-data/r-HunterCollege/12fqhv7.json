However, most likely and in most cases, students get off the waitlist after May 1st due to students committing to other schools. If you want to call, you can call Hunter Admissions @ (212) 772-4000.",

Ask to speak with an admissions counselor if they allow bc whoever you're speaking to may just be just a college aide agent and not the admissions counselor. Don't worry about the other wait listed students or students who have yet to hear back or whatever else they mention, this is about your application, shoot all your shots. It's a valid thing to do, it's important to continue to communicate with your schools, and be please be diligent in doing so especially when you don't hear back. Good luck, don't give up, and continue to follow up :) The squeakier wheel gets the grease/oil in this volume of applicants!\n\nKnow whatever id numbers you may need to know before you call. Expect long waits. (Calling in the morning on the dot is best lol don't wanna be that person, but at the same time, be that person xD) Ask for their name, direct line, or email should you get to speak with an admissions counselor. If they even provide a direct line.",

At the time I got waitlisted, I'd already have made a few calls and sent a few emails asking them what I could do moving forward while being on the waitlist. I even joined a Zoom meeting that they offered for a one-on-one with the admissions counselor, and it went quite poorly. Lasted like 5 minutes and the person behind the screen was very curt and offered very vague answers. With commitment day around the corner, I'm starting to feel anxious and out of place. I don't mind waiting after May 1st, but it is also killing me at the same time. Should I mention all this stuff I've done on the call? Like, should I tell them I've consulted in admissions counselors a few months back and want to take further action, or will they think I'm being desperate and calling too much attention to my application? \n\nOnce again, thank you for your reply,",

But depending on where you\u2019re applying from, there\u2019s a dedicated admissions officer for each region. I had Tony Blackwell and he\u2019s very thorough and clear about his stuff\u2026",

No need to mention the previous admission counselor unless they said something relevant or of use. Just ask for a reevaluation if it's possible. Or as the comment below says, see if you can also reach that Tony Blackwell admission counselor and see if you can get anywhere.",

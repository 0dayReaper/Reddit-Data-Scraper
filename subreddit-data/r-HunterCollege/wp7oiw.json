    "postText": "The semester is about to start and I still haven't be able to get into a class because all the courses with the good professors are full or have a waitlist. I see that there is an open seat in a STAT 113 with Cesar Pabon Bernal. His reviews on rmp say he's good prof. The only downside is that the class is async so there won't be an live interactions for us to learn. I'm 3rd on the waitlist with Joseph Romero, his class is in person. His reviews on rmp are impeccable. I would really like to stay but I want to make sure I take stats this semester.\n\nIm conflicted on whether I should settle for the async class or stay on the waitlist. I really wanna do well in this class so I feel like a good professor is essential. Has anyone taken async stats? How were your experiences?",

            "comment": "The way the stat department teaches stats in Hunter is TERRIBLE. It doesn't matter which professor you have since you'll be doing all your homework and taking your exams on a website called ALEKS. Your professor doesn't matter because they will be following a grading system from the department. I got an A- from the class even though my final average was a 96 and it should've been an A but it wasn't because I choose not to do the 30+ page research paper (which counts as zero towards your average grade so you can't even use it to boost your grade up, you just need to do it and get a satisfactory pass). On top of that bloody research paper, I ended up with 95 hours in total working on problems (homework and exams) on the website ALEKS since it tracks your time studying/doing hw/reviews/etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the most time-consuming class I've ever taken. It feels like I was taking 2 classes at once. Unfortunately, this class is a required class and the way they teach/grade will be the same throughout the department. Goodluck.",

However, I didn't really learn much from him. I learned majority of the material from the hw program (ALEKS). \n\nI would say if you are the type of person that can learn from practice problems (more self learn), then take the async class. However if u want to actually learn from a prof teaching, stay on the waitlist.",

The final was made by the math department, so it was very different than the exams during the semester.",

I will say this tho, with Romero, in order to get an A/A+, theres a additional project and a extra exam (4 exams compared to 3). If you don't do either, the highest grade you would be able to get is an A- regardless of your average. Idk if this is the case with other professors, but that's how it was when I took the class.",

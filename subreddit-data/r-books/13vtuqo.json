            "comment": "I recently wrote a historical fiction piece that takes place where I live (Memphis) and couldn't find accurate information about the time period online. So I went to the infamous Memphis Room at the main branch of the library with a netbook and scanner. I had a BLAST. Felt like Indiana Jones researching old tomes for hidden gems of info. Also was able to access newspaper archives from the day. I think getting away from the desk and doing in-person research is way too overlooked--and can be a lot of fun.",

Books are researched, edited, combed thru, then published so it's a valid work you're tackling. Not some horseshiit some asshole spews online. Even now ppl don't know how to research online.

That means going through the card catalog to find books that you would then have to manually go through to find the information and see if it's even relevant.\n\nYeah research was much more difficult and time consuming back then.  To say nothing of if someone had checked out a book you wanted.  So either you find another library or you just wait for them to bring it back... if they ever do.",

My understanding is that writers generally spent some time in libraries, or consulting experts of their acquaintance, or just making things up. \n\nStephen King often credited his older, smarter brother with doing the research and providing the facts necessary for his stories to be realistic.

Even then, it wasn't anywhere near what it is today in terms of disseminating useful information quickly and easily.  It certainly wasn't a place to find trustworthy information.  People were still using things like Encarta on CDs.  Gen X definitely did not grow up with it.  Many people thought all of the computers were going to crash when the date format changed at the turn of the century - like planes might fall from the sky and so forth.  I entered college in 1999 and can remember being upset that I needed to use the card catalogue on the computer because they made the physical version rather inaccessible.  Growing up, people still had computer rooms.  I remember one friend's family never turned their computer off because they believed they were shortening the life of the computer every time they did.  Or presenting a project in elementary school and many parents being impressed that I had typed it myself and knew how to type quickly/well.  And computers were still not widely accessible to everyone of varying socio economic classes until the mid to late 90's and even then not even remotely as much as they are today.  It's fair to say that even in the early 2000's the internet was still a novelty to many.",

I recommend the movie *Desk Set* (1957), starring Katherine Hepburn as a reference librarian for a television network and Spencer Tracy as an early computer expert hired to install a giant computer for the network.\n\nThere were also many reference books that have essentially been replaced by Google searches. There were encyclopedias, timelines, almanacs, thesauruses, dictionaries, grammar guides, atlases, and more.\n\nAnd some of the more successful writers could employ research assistants. Prolific historical fiction writer James Michener was sometimes accused of letting his research assistants write his books for him, and his lesser works do tend to be long on research and short on character development and narrative.",

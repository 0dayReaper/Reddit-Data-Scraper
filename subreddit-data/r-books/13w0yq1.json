It was just too obvious from the emphasis on the main character that they were involved in what happened between Alicia and Gabriel. \n\nWhere did you predict the big reveal / who the murderer was?",

I'm not especially observant but after reading 30 Agatha Christie's I can pretty much guess the murderer every time. Also I deliberately try to not think about plot twists so I can be surprised, I don't actively try to solve anything.",

Or the trial being utterly derailed by Moist suddenly being 110% honest.!&lt;\n\nGreat book. I know the magic &amp; weirdness throws some people off, but Sir Terry had a great knack for internally insistent threads of logic.",

But what I did not guess is the motive or the means and the end did hit me like a ton of bricks DESPITE my suspicions of the killer.\n\nI felt both vindicated but also surprised.

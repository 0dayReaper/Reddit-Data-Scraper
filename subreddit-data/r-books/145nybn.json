I remember reading Twilight in high school and no matter how many times Meyer described his bronze hair, I just kept picturing an actor I saw at a Dracula play. So the whole time I imagined this proper, darkly dressed vampire with long black hair and a cape going to high school.\n\nIt was funny when the movie trailer released because I was like, \"Oh so that's what he was supposed to look like.\" XD",

In fact, when an author devotes too much of the page (for me, at least) to physical description, my interest wanes. This even happens with excellent writers whose works I otherwise would enjoy, like China Mi\u00e9ville.\n\nIf the character description or scenery being ***perfectly*** realized within the reader's mind, as opposed to reasonably understood with key aspects being clear, is intrinsic to the story, then it should probably be told via a different medium than the written word.",

They may try and coat it in a guise of feminism, or safety concerns (it's always \"concerns\" tbh), but the very essence of being a TERF is hating trans people and constantly thinking of ways to do them harm. That's all it is.   \n\nThe mask is off, so she might as well double down. TERFs and nazis will buy her book to support her, probably. And she's already rich, so she can hate the peasants openly.",

The most famous is Ed Gein, who was the inspiration for many horror movies and books, including Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Silence of the Lambs. That being said, given how our collective understanding of trans people has evolved over time, these depictions have aged rather poorly, though are somewhat excusable given when they were made. But JKR\u2019s book, especially given her recent comments/rants/essays, comes off more as her intentionally choosing a trans person as a villain to send the message that trans women in particular are just men that are seeking to prey on women, which obviously isn\u2019t true. So while there are examples, the issue is really that it\u2019s reinforcing a negative stereotype of an already marginalized group of people.",

There are two distinct people living in his body and both are mentally ill. One is a man who is very childish and lonely and the other is the personification of his mother that he killed after years of torment. \n\nFinkle had disguised himself as a woman to infiltrate the Miami police department and enact a heinous scheme directed at the Miami Dolphins and Dan Marino in particular. Not truly trans either as his entire purpose of looking like the other sex was for ulterior reasons beyond becoming a women. \n\nI'm not saying Rowling is in the right, far from it honestly. I am saying that villains who crossdress and are also normally clinically ill are not inherently transphobic. Rather they are one edge of a spectrum of illness that drives them to dress as the opposite sex for either nefarious or personality bending reasons that entail violence and anger. Rowling has been on record with her feelings. But Hitchcock based Norman on a book character who was based on Ed Gein. Jim Carrey went on record with this when the film was released- \"I wanted to keep the action unreal and over the top. When it came time to do my reaction to kissing a man, I wanted it to be the biggest, most obnoxious, homophobic reaction ever recorded. It's so ridiculous it can't be taken seriously--even though it guarantees that somebody's going to be offended.\" Silence of the Lambs explicitly states in both the novel and movie Gumb is not trans but has a belief that wearing a woman's skin would make him something else entirely.",

But the way the character is written, reflects what people like Ian Fleming, believed to be true about lesbians.",

Gathering info from people who have a broad understanding on the subject, rather than an echo chamber of anti \"cancel culture\" (advocates?). That would include most places on the internet especially comment sections where the info is from people who haven't earned their place to have a platform because of their simplistic and underdeveloped opinons. Contrapoint on YouTube is a good place to begin understanding the subject, but not exclusively this sceniro.\n\nIt's a complicated subject and understandable to have many angry people involved in it. But being thorough and slow in explaining the subject to people is going to be nessassary, and will take much more time and effort than most subjects. It's not easy to change somebodies point of view, especially when they are not willing to do so. They often will ask sarcastic questions rather than genuine conversation points.\n\nSo if you ask yourself \"Am I willing to spend time listening to a different point of view which I assume I will disagree with?\" And if the answer is typically no, maybe just avoiding the subject all together and moving on will save some sleep. And maybe, one day it will all become more accepted &amp; people will feel like it's okay to accept others for who they are. That will be nessassary in order to understand how this could negatively effect the trans community as a whole.",

No. The issues are still there.\nIt does, though, remove my ability to really care because all the criticism comes across as hollow and fake. \n\nWhen someone says, \"Oh JK Rowling is transphobic. She needs to have her platform stripped and no one should buy her books\" all I can think of is all of the people I mentioned above. Everyone criticizing JK Rowling has said or done something racist/homophobic/transphobic and still believes something that fits into at least one of those categories. Even if it's not wrong now, it will be in ten or twenty years, so what kind of moral position do they really have to criticize her? And it's not even the criticism - because those things should be criticized. \n\nIt's the shrieking, pearl-clutching outrage that really makes it feel so - fake. Because anyone who is that emotional about someone else's pain that they don't even know (in this case trasn people) would have the self-awareness to realize that they themselves have \"wrong\" opinions too, because we all do - and they wouldn't be screaming and pearl-clutching in the first place. They would realize that everyone has some kind of wrong opinion and that the heap of criticism they're dumping on JK Rowling could easily be them in five years, when one of their ideas about the world suddenly becomes \"wrong.\" I know five separate trans people (although one is transitioning back to their starting gender, so not sure if that counts) and only a single one cares about the things JK Rowling has said. All of the rest, when it's came up in conversation have just been like: \"I have much bigger things to worry about, like paying rent, and getting healthcare.\"\n\nSo yeah - I don't care, not because the issue is unimportant, but because I don't believe the people perpetuating the outrage have any valid moral platform from which to criticize her, or will ever do anything to actually address the real issues that underlie the \"problem.\" They're the modern version of the pearl-clutching \"Christian Moms\" I always saw on television growing up, talking about how kids shouldn't be allowed to play Call of Duty or read Harry Potter because it was \"satanic.\" Video games don't cause school-shootings, the same way that JK Rowling doesn't cause trans people to be murdered the world over. You care about trans people? Volunteer and spend your free time helping them. You'll do more good than cancelling JK Rowling ever will.",

I think we also have to have that \"well its different\" annoyance with JK- like she is SO beloved by people and if you're of a certain age- her books were part of your upbringing but I see so many people apologize or excuse what she is saying. If she had a different legacy- was new on the scene- wasn't as prominent- these tweets would be outright deemed as bigoted but because its from her- folks are scrambling to contextualize them or shroud them in like these academic high-rhetoric veils.",

Everyone has something about them worth criticizing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's the vitriolic hatred embedded in a lot of the criticism that makes me think it's not actually based in caring about trans people. It's people demanding that everyone else has to care about this too, or they're part of the problem. A care about others doesn't produce that kind of vitriol, and it reminds me of my friend's father growing up, and the absolute rage he showed anytime he felt he wasn't be \"respected,\" which is to say, \"obeyed.\" Every time I see these kinds of things, I absolutely cannot help but think of that man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus, and I could be wrong about this, I remember her first stuff being fairly banal, saying that she feels like trans rights activists take away from the struggle for womens' rights, and she got pushback, and then doubled down, right? Then doubled-down again? How much of her current position is just her doubling down against the mob?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus - and I really want an answer to this. It's not me being cheeky, I promise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf she apologized right now, and said she was wrong for everything - said she had a \"Road to Damascus\" moment - do you really think all of the people criticizing her now would accept that? Say she donated $1 million to a trans organization, would that be enough? Do you think that they would stop criticizing her, or would they watch her double as close, waiting for her to \"step out of line\" again? If they did, how long before she loses the reputation as an \"anti-trans\" author? Apologizing, for as much as we hate it, is an admission of wrong-doing, and I really don't see that going well for her.",

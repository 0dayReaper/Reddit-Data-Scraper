    "postText": "I'm talking about books like those classic Russian novels, stuff that's more focused on the characters and a philosophical message rather than a plot. I just can't get into these types of books. It's all just so dreadfully boring. I'm not someone who needs one liners and explosions every 5 minutes, I can appreciate a good slow burn, but books like Brothers Karamazov bore me to death when I tried to start it. Any tips on how I can appreciate this type of book more?",

Something that\u2019s probably relatable to a lot of people",

I won\u2019t lie to you the book is partially build around indifference making the writing boring but I found that to be quite interesting in a lot of situations. It\u2019s only about 120 pages depending on your Edition but the second chapter and especially the end felt really rewarding",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not of the opinion you need to read books like that if you\u2019re not interested in them. I think there\u2019s more value reading something that intrigues or excites you that you can share with people in your life than something that will give you \u201cscholar cred\u201d in bookish circles in the internet. \n\nBut if you do want to try, I\u2019d recommend coming up with what will pull you through before beginning the story. Most books rely on plot. Others will use jokes or witty dialog. Others still will use beautiful language and imagery to compel you to keep reading. Try reading some critiques and reviews of these books and figure out what it is that others see in them. Then keep that in mind as you read. \u201cI\u2019m reading this for X. I\u2019m going to keep an eye out for Y.\u201d Might make it easier to feel like you\u2019re reading with a purpose. \n\nYou say it\u2019s not specifically Russian classic literature but just books that are less plotful and more about ideas. Let me recommend one that is like that but lighter than something like Uncle Vanya. A Psalm for the Wild-Built is a cozy science fiction story about a monk who loses their passion for their job and goes on a pilgrimage to find purpose. Along the way, they run into a robot who is seeking the knowledge of what humans need. So they pair up. It is slow and contemplative, but has beautiful language and all of the philosophical pondering takes places as a dialog which makes it faster. It won\u2019t give you that same scholar cred as classic Russian literature but you\u2019re more likely to get through it.",

            "comment": "Here are my recommendations. 1) Start with shorter books that fit that mold. \n\n2) Read physical books. I'm convinced that our expectations are different when we read on a device and it makes us more impatient. On a printed book you're more likely to scan backwards to verify understanding and contemplate and less likely to skim forward to skip over things your brain thinks are unimportant. \n\n3) Read more slowly. Don't worry about making forward progress. I loved reading Anna Karenina but it took me 6 months. I usually read way more pages than that in 6 months, but I was going very slow and that's part of why I enjoyed it so much. Let yourself pause to think. Re-read sentences or paragraphs. Your focus should be on creating a thoughtful contemplative state for yourself. \n\n4) Focus on the way your mind feels while reading. The benefits of reading these types of books don't show up immediately. It's less about transferring a \"philosophical message\" from book to reader, and more about training your mind to think in a certain way and about certain things so that your mind opens to different ideas.",

Those can provide essential context, explain out of date things, and help you better understand the text. There are even online classes for many classic books. \n\nThese kind of books are hard to read alone as an adult. Unless you already have the right educational background for the text you are reading, you are not going to fully understand it without some kind of help.",

My taste has shifted a lot over the years but if you find yourself thinking about life in a more philosophical way you may find yourself picking up books in that mold.  So while you might now enjoy them now, don\u2019t write them off forever. \n\nThere are also many many different types and the mechanisms authors use to tell it are vast. For me, the creativity authors use to present their ideas is as interesting as the ideas themselves, sometimes even more so.",

They were getting paid *by the page*; therefore, the incentive was there for them to be extremely detailed and verbose.  You have to get older to really appreciate their style of writing.  I remember thinking when I was younger: \"There's nothing wrong with Charles Dickens that a good editor couldn't fix.\"  \n\nIt sort of makes you appreciate Hemingway the revolution in writing novels he started: short, declarative sentences which were very lean and to the point.",

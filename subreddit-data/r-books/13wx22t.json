That must feel pretty special.\n\n&gt;This year the judging panel wanted to have children more involved in the assessment process for the awards, so 15 primary, intermediate and secondary schools from across the motu were recruited to offer feedback.\n\n&gt;Each school was sent a selection of entries from relevant categories, together with review forms and judging guidelines to encourage critical thinking about the books. Their feedback was then shared with the judges.\n\nI LOVE this approach! I think other awards for children's arts and media could learn from this (particularly the Oscars - one year people who voted on the animation category were surveyed on the reasons for their choices, and they were mostly along the lines of \"this was the only one I've heard of\" and \"I liked the trailer for this one more\").",

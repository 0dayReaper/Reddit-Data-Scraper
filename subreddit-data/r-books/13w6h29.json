    "postText": "I know a bit about \"literary theory\", but (from what I've gathered) it's mostly about the various ways to interpret literary texts as opposed to what makes a work of literature great. Is there any field of study which does this?\n\nMusic theory provides a framework that allows musicians to create and identify great music. Film studies does the same thing for movies. What about literature?\n\nObviously, art isn't science, so there's no way to definitively say what makes a work of literature great (i.e. I can call Tolstoy trash and James Patterson a God and no one can say I'm technically wrong), but I was just curious if anyone has tried to implement a specific set of standards for this medium.",

            "comment": "I would challenge the idea that \"music theory provides a framework that allows musicians to create and identify great music.\" Music theory is a broad field, and is not generally concerned with whatever \"greatness\" is. Music theory is much more similar to literary analysis, in that it's about describing and analyzing what's happening in music and how it affects audiences.",

There is also the rising and falling action diagram that shows the basic general structure of a plot, however both of those examples are bent and rearranged and completely thrown out the window sometimes in some truly amazing writing.\n\nLike you said, writing isn't a science, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution to writing a good story. As my creative writing professor once said: \"all that matters is that your story just works.\"",

Maybe you just have not found the theory that you like. While the New Criticism and New Historicism are out of fashion, they may be what you are looking for. I can understand how many forms of theory do not.  \n\n\nAs I recall Terry Eagleton's Literary Theory: an Introduction, was like a catalog of ways to think about writing. As a young person it expanded the ways I could enjoy writing.",

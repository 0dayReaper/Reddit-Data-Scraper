    "postText": "This post is just to vent and possibly connect with others who have similar issues. I used to be a book-per-week kinda person. Reading for hours made me feel euphoric. I finally got a proper diagnosis a couple of years ago and now take medication to manage pretty rough OCD symptoms. Totally improved my quality of life. But... it seems now my brain is behaving more like someone with ADD. I can hardly read, maybe one chapter every few days. I miss it so much. I've been reading the same book for like 8 months now. In my down time, I find myself watching TV and scrolling my phone more than I ever did before. My memory is crappy as well. I feel like I traded one demon for another, OCD for ADD.",

Maybe you can pursue a new hobby that you can connect with or maybe give audio books a try. Or, maybe a totally different creative thing; it doesn\u2019t have to be books alone. Make your overall health and wellness a priority and everything will eventually fall into place. I used to be a voracious reader in the past but due to changes in life circumstances, reading took a backseat for a while. It\u2019s slowly coming back though. Just be patient and go with the flow of life.",

I got told when I was in my mid twenties that I'd become less mobile and I decided to amass as much stuff as I could so when I'm housebound I'm not going to be bored.   \n\n\nAnd over twenty years later I'm glad I did. There have been times when like you, I couldn't face reading, so I learned if that sort of drudgery happens, to put it away and do something else. Simply wait until you start thinking about it again or are more able.   \n\n\nFor me, I amassed plenty of books, plenty of records (well I already  had plenty from previously being a DJ) and CDs, synths, guitars, a pinball machine and an arcade machine I cobbled together, and shedloads of video games, and a couple of telescopes. I also repair electronics from time to time.  \n\n\nSo any time I feel bored or can't manage something, I switch to something else. Sometimes it takes weeks before I can go back.   \n\n\nIt's not perfect by any means but this can help.",

            "comment": "I fully sympathize with you. I have epilepsy, and I\u2019ve been on a few medications that have prevented me from recreational reading. The medication side effects were so that I would completely forget what I had just read just a few seconds earlier. Another awful side effect was that the center of my vision would not be what was actually there, but instead a bright white light. That would be whether I was reading off my iPad or a paperback book. I know what you are feeling because this problem was one of the main reasons why I had to find a different medication. I missed reading too much! It definitely messes with a person\u2019s quality of life.\n\nI have a feeling that a difficulty reading is a problem caused by many different medications. \ud83d\udc94",

I tried a few times, but like you I just could. not. focus. \n\nI kept trying. I felt like I had a TBR list longer than most books, and I couldn\u2019t even finish one. Then, an old high school friend randomly sent me a link to a webnovel. We used to lend each other books all through middle and high school. She said it reminded her of me and she thought I might like it. It was like the floodgates opened. It was 1.2 million words and I read it in 3 days. It seemed like I could feel old neurons realigning.  I\u2019ve been reading and listening like I need it to live ever since. All kinds of genres, fiction and nonfiction, text and audio. Maybe you just need to find that one book to find the spark and get in the groove again.",

When I feel like reading, I try to make sure I\u2019m as relaxed as possible, in a quiet environment, with no electronics nearby to distract me (and my phone on airplane mode), unless I\u2019m on an e-reader in which case I turn the wifi off.  When things get especially rough I\u2019ll read aloud, or listen to an audiobook and read at the same pace as the narrator is speaking.  Since I\u2019m a fast reader, these things slow me down and help me take in the content better, and make it easier to concentrate.  I still often default to watching YouTube, though - some days it just feels like too much effort to struggle through a book.  I try to push myself most of the time but some days just be like that.\n\nAll the best.  You\u2019re not alone.  Hugs from an internet stranger.",

If you are keen you can copy the CD's from the library and put them on the server. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also found that i prefer certain narrators and have discovered new books and genres simply by searching for the narrator and giving it a try. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt certainly isnt the same as holding a book in your hand and physical act of reading but at least you are still getting the brain work out.",

Eventually I realized they were the cause of my deteriorating health and went through a horrific withdrawal to get off of them. The severe withdrawal caused a brain injury and I have barely been able to read (or do anything at all) since. The withdrawal also caused me to develop ocd which I did not have before. I have maybe read 10 books in the last ten years since this nightmare started. And I probably read 500 or so in the 10 years before that when I was still healthy. \n\nAnyway, I feel for you, ocd is hell and dealing with med side effects can be as well.",

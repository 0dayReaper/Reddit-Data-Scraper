    "postText": "A friend of mine gave me a copy and said it was one of her favorite books, so naturally I had to give it a chance.\n\nI\u2019m loving the writing style.  People say Marquez was influenced by Faulkner but I\u2019m not seeing a lot of Faulkner\u2019s flaws (page-long sentences, for instance, which are a nightmare to read when you have ADHD).\n\nThis family is deeply dysfunctional and I\u2019m loving it.  I\u2019m up to the (first?) civil war and the amount of Drama is already \ud83e\udd0c\n\nThe bones!  The player piano!  The chestnut tree!  The insomnia!  I hate when I have to put the book down.  I can\u2019t wait to see how it ends.",

            "comment": "I disagree with you about Faulkner\u2019s sentences but the comparison to Faulkner is less about formal structure and more about the way that both he and Marquez play with time, create a setting that is at once realistic and very much unreal and how they make use of the family saga in an interesting way and share a fascination with hyper-local cultures and ways of being. It\u2019s one of my favourites.",

I guess I have no reason for commenting here except I'm still secretly hoping that someone will be able to explain the appeal and make me want to go back and finish it. Are there examples of \"newbie magical realism\" that I should read before tackling this one again? Or is the \"If you have to ask, you'll never know\" principle a defining feature of the genre?",

Since I've only read translations, I can't judge the original prose.\n\nEvery object in GGM's works have character.  The weather, the river, constipation, roads, dust, heat,... all become actors rather than settings.  The histories are discreet and compel the characters, without limiting their motions through the present.",

I don\u2019t revisit GGM stories much anymore, but I\u2019ll always consider his books, 100 Years especially, as books that helped me love literature and reading. The final 10 pages or so of 100 Years, when I got to the end I realized I\u2019d actually been holding my breath. That kind of reaction has never happened with any other book for me, so GGM\u2019s skill as a storyteller will forever be undeniable to me.",

The end of the school year is long gone, my summer vacation is\n&gt; \n&gt; almost over, and I haven't spoken to you. I went to see my aunt in the countryside, I went to Warsaw,\n&gt; \n&gt; saw Mama and now I'm back. But you don't know about any of tha . You were lying here, left on your\n&gt; \n&gt; own with my thoughts and you don't even know that we have a secret mobilization, you don't know\n&gt; \n&gt; that the Russians have signed a treaty with the Germans. You don't know that people are stockpiling\n&gt; \n&gt; food, that everybody's on aler , waiting for...war'\n\n**June 7, 1942**\n\n&gt; Wherever I look, there is bloodshed. Such terrible pogroms. There is killing, murdering. God Almighty, for the umpteenth time I humble myself in front of you, help us, save us! Lord God, let us live, I beg You, I want to live! I've experienced so little of life. I don't want to die. I'm scared of death. It's all so stupid, so petty, so unimportant, so small. Today I'm worried about being ugly; tomorrow I might stop thinking forever.\n&gt; \n&gt; Think, tomorrow we might not be\n&gt; \n&gt; A cold, steel knife\n&gt; \n&gt; Will slide between us, you see\n&gt; \n&gt; But today there is still time for life\n&gt; \n&gt; Tomorrow sun might eclipse\n&gt; \n&gt; Gun bullets might crack and rip\n&gt; \n&gt; And howl -- pavements awash\n&gt; \n&gt; With blood, with dirty, stinking slag\n&gt; \n&gt; Pigwash\n&gt; \n&gt; Today you are alive\n&gt; \n&gt; There is still time to survive\n&gt; \n&gt; Let's blend our blood\n&gt; \n&gt; When the song still moves ahead\n&gt; \n&gt; The song of the wild and furious flood\n&gt; \n&gt; Brought by the living dead\n&gt; \n&gt; Listen, my every muscle trembles\n&gt; \n&gt; My body fumbles for your closeness\n&gt; \n&gt; It's supposed to be a choking game, this is\n&gt; \n&gt; Not enough eternity for all the kisses\n\n **July 15, 1942**\n\n&gt; Remember this day; remember it well. You will tell generations to come. Since 8 o'clock today we have been shut away in the ghetto. I live here now. The world is separated from me and I'm separated from the world.\n\nEdit:\n&gt; Renia was murdered [July 30, 1942] at the age of 18 when the Nazis discovered her hiding in an attic. She left the diary with her boyfriend, who wrote the chilling, heartbreaking last lines in the journal: \"Three shots! Three lives lost! All I can hear are shots, shots.\"",

I think both aspects of that statement have to be true though:\n\n* Teenage or younger me. I would not want an adult diary published as \"eh, he was just a kid\" holds less weight.\n* Long after I die. The key word is long here. I don't know what long is exactly, but it would have to be long enough that the people close to me are not grieving.\n\nI understand other people may feel differently and in the absence of knowing their wishes the best we have is those close to them. Is her dad not wanting that published due to selfish reasons or what he thinks her wishes are? No idea, but his wishes were the closest we had to her.\n\nEven in instances when major pieces were removed, I agree with you that the best compromise is stating what was removed. No need to be specific and tactful language should be used, but it should be clear enough that the reader knows generally (not specifically) what was removed.",

She had her original, private diary, and then (after hearing that the Dutch Government in exile planned to collect and publish accounts of the occupation after the war) a more polished version that she planned to send to the collection.\n\nLast year, someone found a few \u201cdirty\u201d jokes - not really risqu\u00e9 by adult standards, but enough to make a thirteen year old snigger - that she\u2019d heard around the Annex, written down to giggle at and then hidden because she didn\u2019t want them in the edited \u201cpublic\u201d diary after all.\n\nu/cereborn is right to say her father did some editing, but that was a different thing. That was post-war editing for publication, whereas this was new material physically being found on the 1940s pages.",

People also question how objective her father was, and if a neutral 3rd party would have edited it differently. And then there is the debate around potentially erasing content that is relevant to LGBT+ history and whether or not homophobia played a part of what got edited.",

It's also quite possible she was mostly straight but questioning which many people go through. \n\nI want to emphasize that I don't care at all what her sexuality was. I know from experience that for a gay teenager those feelings are an intensely personal and private thing.",

Ultimately we have no way of knowing what she would have done if she had lived, or what (if any) revisions she would have made 20-30-40 years down the line. It's possible she would have edited those parts out herself in 1950, but added them back in 1990 due to changing cultural norms. We simply have no idea.\n\nI personally don't know the answer. But it's an issue that's we as a society are going to have to continue to deal with. Most recently it came up in regards to Jordan Cofer (more commonly known as Megan Betts), who was apparently only out as trans to a small circle of people and then was outed nationally posthumously. \n\nAs someone in a similar situation to Jordan (out to a very small number of people, but not anyone in my family) I admit that I don't think that I'd want that information becoming public if I died in a tragic way. Maybe give my family some time to grieve and then tell them in private, but like... I promise I'm not going to haunt people if my obit has my assigned gender at birth.",

It was not good writing, nor was it even good historical writing. The contents show a first person perspective, but there are plenty of better examples. Additionally, reading it feels pervy, invasive, and really messed up. She clearly never intended to have the world reading all her private thoughts.\n\nIf you really want a well written piece of first person holocaust nonfiction to feel depressed about, Night by Elie Wiesel is a far better selection.",

The second is something she started doing after they were in hiding - a call went out over the radio that the Dutch government in exile would be interested in accounts of life under occupation, and would publish good ones after the war ended and the Netherlands was liberated, so Anne began looking over her private diary and editing parts of it so she could eventually send it in.\n\nThe diary published NOW is a weird mixture of the original private text, the text Anne edited herself intending to send those bits in, and a different set of edits her father Otto made when he got the diary back after the war.\n\nOtto\u2019s edits tend to be the strictest. He was mourning both his daughters and his wife, so he toned down a lot of the tensions between Anne and Margot, or Anne and her mother.",

There\u2019s a great deal to be said for first person testimony on day-to-day life as it is happening. The problem with the books by Elie Wiesel, as incredible as they are, is that they have been written in hindsight. Therefore necessarily things have been forgotten, edited, or arranged to make more sense. Therein lies the inherent value of a diary. While the arrangement is strictly chronological, we are seeing Anne\u2019s life from a variety of moods perspectives and her day-to-day interactions with the outside world as it is brought in to her via radio and their helpers.",

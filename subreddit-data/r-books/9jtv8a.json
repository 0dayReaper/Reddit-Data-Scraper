I was basically in solitary in a single cell 23 hours a day for a month, and I got a priest to bring me The Invisible Man by HG Wells and a National Geographic magazine. I read them both several times in a row and it kept me from losing my sanity. Strange things happen to your thoughts when you're staring at the walls for weeks, and having a book is the next best thing to having someone to bounce your thoughts off of.  I remember seeing the name of a drug written on a nurse's paper or something, and thought the word sounded funny. Ketoconazole. Ketoconazole. The word stuck in my head and at times I couldn't stop repeating it over and over. Ketoconazole...",

The problem is that during those decades pretty much our entire political culture was composed of nitwits who didn't know the difference between reforms that actually help an identifiable human being in some way and \"reforms\" that simply inject additional layers of private profit-taking into the public's business.  There is hardly any sector of our society that has not been corrupted through compulsive and consistent bipartisan obseisance to investment bankers.  Now we find new ways to boost the intensity of our noise machines because quite literally all the money in the world doesn't want us talking about how to deal with the traditional corruption that long predated 2016.",

In fact, since almost a century before the Constitution of the United States even existed. \n\nIt seems so sad to see this happening in Pennsylvania of all places, the birthplace in the U.S. of both prison reform and libraries. Such irony! The state of Pennsylvania might want to consider a different name, considering how William Penn might feel about these new prison policies.\n\n\"William Penn was the first great Quaker prison reformer. In his \u2018Great Experiment\u2019 in Pennsylvania in the 1680s he abolished capital punishment for all crimes except murder. He also stated that \u2018prisons shall be workhouses,\u2019 that bail should be allowed for minor offences\u2019, and \u2018all prisons shall be free, as to fees, food and lodgings\u2019. He provided for rehabilitation, as he stipulated that prisoners should be helped to learn a trade, so that they could make an honest living when they were released. These were radical reforms for his time, putting into practice his Quaker faith in equality ...\" [source](http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/43/Reformers-in-Criminal-Justice)\n\n\"In the American colonies, the Library Company of Philadelphia was started in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia.\" [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library)\n\n",

This is especially disturbing because the US prison system is the most inhumane condition one can find in the developed world.\n\nThe first thing that the US needs to do is eliminate solitary confinement, as it's probably the leading cause of recidivism among inmates.

I'm sure there are terms for this stuff in psychology, but it's the same thing with Nazi Germany, right? It just takes some amount of persuasive/manipulative people to change and make a culture act a certain way so that impressionable people start to enable or take part in it. Peer pressure essentially. \n\n\nThinking back on when I was a teenager/young adult, I egged several cop cars (such a badass /s). It was incredibly stupid, but I also have no doubt that I wouldn't have done it if not for the people I was with. It doesn't excuse or justify behavior whatsoever, but it explains it, and explaining it is absolutely critical if we care to prevent crime before it happens. \n\nReconciling a need for justice, which I think any healthy scoeity should have, with objective and cold rational, is really hard. I just worry that we can get too emotional at times, and mob rule/\"justice\" is pretty horrific in my opinion.\n\nedit: \n\n&gt;These same people then obviously react extremely negatively to any idea that criminal justice should be about rehabilitation.\n\nI'd also add that it's really annoying because whenever you talk about what you said, they immediately jump to \"SO YOU WANT TO DEFEND CRIMINALS, HUH?!\"",

Think about that for a minute,  it nearly literally means that you could _flip a coin_ for every person you release from prison..  and if it lands heads,  they'll get their life back together,  tails,  they'll be back in jail -- usually within the year.\n\nThat's just objectively insane to operate that system and say it represents a moral solution.\n\n",

Many complain about being forced to study 18 hours a day, while others report being humiliated by taser wielding educators for not getting an A+ on their prison exams. \"This feels like China\" sobbed one prisoner as he cried over his 89% math exam. The terror does not stop even after their release. Former prisoners have found prison representatives breaking into their houses at night to check if they are healthy, as it is in the interests of the prisons to keep their released prisoners healthy for as long as possible. \"THE AXIOM PRISON REP THREW MY FAST FOOD OUT THE WINDOW AND FORCED ME TO EAT A BOWL OF SALAD! screamed one former prisoner.\"",

I think Time Magazine had a recent article stating that 39% of inmates can be released based on the frivolity of their charges or their sentences. So there\u2019s a lot of people in there that made a mistake and it will ruin their lives and their family\u2019s as well. It\u2019s devastating.\n\nI was at Rikers (NYC\u2019s mega jail) and I was with 18-21 yo inmates. They went a few weeks without an incident so we gave them movies. One of the movies was Madagascar. This big dude starting singing \u201cI like to move it, move it...\u201d and others starting joining him and clowning on him lol.\n\nAt first, I was laughing but then I was like whoa shit, these are just kids. Then I was heartbroken. \n\nYou can have your opinions on whether they are criminals or victims or both or whatever. The fact of the matter is that 95% of inmates will be released back into society at some point. What do you do with them? Do you want them to integrate back into society as productive citizens as seamlessly as possible? Or do you want to just punish them and treat them like criminals for the rest of their lives?  Well, within a decade, 80% of released inmates wind up back in prison. The systems sucks and needs immediate reform.",

She can have I think up to 10 books, and then since her prison is on a military base she can donate her other books to the base library and check them back out that way. \n\nShe's allowed to get books from any bookstore (and I think she mentioned that the prison recently started allowing stuff from families? i'll ask next time she calls). But nothing is preventing her from receiving something from Vithiasorrows's New and Used Books, since the prison doesn't check the bookstores on the packages, just checks the books themselves to make sure they don't contain anything she can't have (magnets in a journal are a no go, as is blank stationery, but a blank journal is okay).

I want them to learn about addiction and the history of cocaine. I want them to have to meditate and analyse why their crime was harmful to others. I want them to be able to work in prison for the cost of their care, and read classics in public domain for free. I want them to be able to learn a trade or a skill, so they have an easier time finding work when their time in prison is over, and for non violent or non-fatal crimes, I want them to be able to start over as well.

You're horrible!! \" Yet, when they learn they're not educating them, like our tax dollars used to pay for, their tone shifts entirely 180\u00b0. Something probably along the lines of it being useless to try to educate these prisoners, about them all being murderers or crazed drug fiends or whatnot. Yet that's not the case all the time. \n\nSomeone made a point about how the US judicial system just bunches people all together, and that's the largest problem. I highly doubt all of our inmates don't want to change, to be better.  It's pathetic that people agree with people who say they don't. A lot I bet want to get out and go back to work for their well-being, even if they have reduced rights. \n\nI guarantee people would share the hell out of this, and possibly already have. However, I guarantee nearly no one gives a shit because to a majority, \"They're just dumb idiots who deserve what they got.\" and that's the society I grew up in slowly.  Apathetic individuals who only care about themselves and anything that benefits themselves. ",

It's easy to hide drugs in a book, but it's equally easy to find them in a book. And look at the titles that are banned. They won't allow The Green Mile, but they'll allow Diary of a South Beach Party Girl, whatever the fuck that is? I mean Jesus fucking Christ. At least give them the fucking Kindle for free. It sounds like another plan to \"keep them poor.\" Makes me sick.  *edit Thank you to those who offered me some additional info. I did notice this article is written in an incredibly one-sided tone.

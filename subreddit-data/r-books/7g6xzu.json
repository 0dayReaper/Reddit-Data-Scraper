Most people deserve a second chance and sadly many don't get one. One thing I'd change about all is treatment of felons and the prison system in general. No one seems to care about them so the issues are often swept under the rug. We are getting marijuana legal but a felon still can't vote? It's insane how we treat these people who have served their time but remain second class citizens for life.",

There are far too many laws and with every law there is the requirement that we all know them.  How is that possible?  How is that a reasonable expectation?  That would make us all lawyers.  It's tantamount to saying \"You have a body, therefore you must be a medical doctor\" or if you have a child you must be a pediatrician as well, and if you have a house you should really be an building engineer.  Do you have a car?  Guess what!  It doesn't follow, so it can't follow.\n\nBut as stated above, the very justification of all of these laws needs to be reassessed.  Look at the recent change of heart on marijuana.  My God, that's huge!  How many people are in prison because they were caught with pot on their person or property or even planted there by unscrupulous law enforcement?  With the zero tolerance laws, how many are still doomed to life in prison?  \n\nHow many judges are freed from punishment for their crimes because they know all the right people and are in a position to influence that?  How many businessmen, bankers, doctors, etc., get away with all sorts of crimes that less wealthy folk suffer in prison for until their dying day?\n\nWhat about the court's right to deny a prisoner the opportunity to exonerate themselves with new evidence?  Should **any** evidence be rejected?  On what grounds?  It seems crazy to me that anything that will show your innocence (or guilt!) can be withheld from a trial.  The whole thing is just as rotten as can be.\n\nJail might be used only until they figure out why the person committed the crime in the first place.  Looking at people as being inextricably linked to the circumstances of their lives is the starting point.  We have far too many social practices that put us and keep us in poverty with more falling ever lower all the time as the social divide deepens.  \n\nIf money is truly at the heart of it, we need to rethink money, too.

It's only ever talked about in isolation, so many people don't realise, but given how badly you are penalised even after release, and just how many even minor crimes give custodial sentences, then you end up with entire populations of people who are locked out of economic participation for things they were accused of doing in their youth.\n\nAfter all that, it's no wonder then that many turn to recidivism as their only viable option. Then add network effects from the rate of ex-convicts in those populations influencing others into participating in criminal activity, and you have a recipe for de facto oppression.",

Before we put someone in prison, we have to ask what exactly the problem is and how that's going to help. \n\nEDIT: Please stop mentioning deterrence as though I've never heard of it. That's exactly what I mean, you have a goal, prison or counseling or whatever has some quantifiable impact on that goal, and that data should be taken into account. Punishment for it's own sake shouldn't be what that goal is, rather public safety or some similar measure of success should be used. It shouldn't be assumed that increasing punishment always increases success or that other interventions are not useful in addition to proper measures of punishment where appropriate. ",

The guilty are segregated from general society first to protect society from having them continue their criminal behavior, and second to give them time to realize the consequences of their actions, rehabilitating them to become productive members of society upon release.\n\nUnfortunately, the punishment mindset derails the rehabilitation potential. Prisoners are more focused on just surviving their time. The public decries funding rehabilitation programs as wastes of money on unworthy criminals. Prison staff dehumanize inmates. Punishment continues after time served as opportunities are denied. Lack of opportunity leads to recidivism and more punishment for being the same, or worse, when they got out as they went in.\n\nThe vengeance of punishment is a losing battle.",

He had to weigh the cost and benefits of legally parking in an inconvenient garage versus in an illegal but convenient spot. After roughly calculating the probability of getting caught and potential punishment, Becker rationally opted for the crime. Becker surmised that other criminals make such rational decisions believing that their judgement is based upon scarce commodity or risk seeking. However, such a premise went against conventional thought that crime was a result of mental illness and social oppression.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Becker#Crime_and_punishment)",

There is zero reason not to engage in MJ sales so long as you don't get too big.

I can generally get the gist of an article by scrolling far enough to find a comment that sums it up without spending 5 minutes dealing with paywalls and slow loading on my phone, but either way I'm not forming any real opinion from my Reddit browsing nor using it as a serious news source. \n\nOf course, not forming an opinion from headlines means that I don't post stupid comments on the subject of the headline that are completely inaccurate because of not reading the article, and I do think that is a bad thing for people to do. If I reply to such threads, it's only to comment on other comments about subjects not directly related to the article (like this one!).",

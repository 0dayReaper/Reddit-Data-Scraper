He asked us if we wanted to take a picture with him and then made sure we were happy with how it turned out before he moved on. Asked about our lives the whole time and told us how happy he is to hear that he's had an impact on people.",

It has a loosely serialized story, that really starts around episode 20-ish, iirc, and only grows as the series progresses (with a pretty excellent stopping point at episode 110 fyi) but you need all the episodes in order to establish the world, characters, plot, tone, etc. Its one you listen to from start to finish, same with Wolf 359.",

As todays false information crisis is showing reading can do exactly the opposite.\n\nPerhaps we have focused too much on reading believing that we'll work it out and not enough about WHAT we are reading and critical thinking. I don't think we could have foreseen what the internet and the amount of published material by immoral actors would do to American society. Back when most reading material was vetted and curated just \"READ\" was enough to educate most people.",

The book reading was always great of course, but the other half of the show that showed how something was made or worked or otherwise presented some subject in a digestible, curiosity-inspiring way was what hooked me most back then. That show gave me the chance to learn about so many things that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have as a rural kid.\n\nThe whole evening lineup on my local PBS station which included Arthur, Reading Rainbow, Wishbone, and Bill Nye was great and I think a major component of who I am today and what I\u2019ve been able to achieve. I don\u2019t have kids so I\u2019m out of touch with shows aimed at that age bracket, but I hope kids today have equivalents to those titans.",

But Martin Luther King Jr convinced her to stay - he saw how important that representation was - A Black woman was a respected officer on a spaceship. Those of us today can't have any idea of how far-fetched that seemed in the 60s. \n\nThat in turn inspired young Whoopi Goldberg, who saw a Black woman playing someone other than a maid on TV for the first time. \n\nSo, I really hope that next time someone sees a diverse cast, and thinks it might be \"woke tokenism\".. realize that yes, it might be, but that also might be the inspiration for someone else.

Unlimited information may be out there, but for the majority of consumers, it's heavily filtered by biased processes and entities. Also: people who don't look for information and don't process (self-)critically don't benefit from faster ways for looking for it.",

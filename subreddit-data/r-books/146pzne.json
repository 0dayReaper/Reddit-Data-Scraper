I blame this on two main factors:\n\n* Watching so many booktube review videos where people give their opinion of a book and the flaws in it has made me a very picky reader, to the point where I can't turn off my brain to enjoy and be on the lookout for flaws like emotional manipulation or redundant dialogue that treats the reader like an idiot.\n* The studies, of course.\n\nThese two factors have made it very difficult for me to engage with what I'm reading. I don't have reader's block, I can still read, but I can't enjoy reading like I did a few months ago.\n\nWhat do you suggest I do to overcome this problem?\n\nIf I have failed to express my problem, feel free to ask me questions.",

Tuatha and the Seven Sisters Moon by D. von Thaer. There are some funny moments in the book, but the grammatical and punctuation errors were overwhelming. This will make most other books look like masterpieces.",

It might not be high art and it might leave your brain and soon as you close there book, but fine.\n\nI usually revert to SciFi in a slump. Even if the books are poorly written books there tends to be some interesting and fun ideas. Popular history and science books are also a fun pallet cleanser. As long as there is something interesting to learn you can excuse the poor qualities of the writing.",

Now his lost dictionary of slang has been discovered in a vast archive of his papers and possessions.",

Thieves used to speak with a highly metaphoric vocabulary, nearly unintelligible to a regular citizen, so people would buy these dictionaries so they could know what thieves were talking about. See for example, *A new Dictionarie of the Terms ancient and modern of the Canting Crew*: https://archive.org/details/newdictionaryoft00begeuoft\n\nEdit: Cutting Crew-&gt;Canting Crew",

One could easily imagine a world where local slang and informal dialects used by the lower class would be ignored by most writers or rejected by publishers, perpetuating itself only through oral tradition in the subculture that used it. I doubt that those using such language regularly were likely to have the status, funding, or inclination to get such a work published themselves in eras where publishing was expensive.\n\nThere have been many cultures where the powerful care little for those beneath them. Heck, u/MrKurtzHeDed suggested that the dictionaries existed primarily so that the reader could protect themselves against thieves, rather than because of any respect for their culture. Exceptions might have existed, but the profitability of such a work isn't self-evident.",

I am quite polezny in gorilla-like bitvas and I\u2019m the top veck with a long pooshka in the entirety of the chassos of Novy Gee-Bee. You, my dorogoy bratty, are nothing to me but just another gloopy nazz.

Did your mozg skazat you that you can bezprestoopny govoreet that cal to me over the Worldcast? Think again, thou oozhassny soomka. Skorry as we govoreet I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Yoo-Ess of A and your IP is being traced right now to your domy so you better sobirat for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the hound-and-horny little thing you call your jeezny. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. Your humble narrator can be any mesto, any time, and I can oobivat you in over seven hundreds of ways, and that\u2019s just with my nagoy rukas. Not only is your dear old Alex extensively trained in bitva without nozh or pooshka, but he also has access to the entire arsenal of the Yoo-Ess-Em-See and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable zhopa off the face of the continent, thou malenky cal. If only you could have known what unBogny retribution your little \u201coomny\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your sodding yahzick. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the tsena, you Bog-damned gloopnick. I will clop cal and fury all over you and you will drown in it. You\u2019re a sodding dook, malchickiwick.",

When I need to get a sticker off a book, I just put it under medium heat on a hairdryer, slowly peel it, then it comes off quickly once the adhesive warms. Then I use just a plain eraser to erase away any of the leftover sticky residue. Between those, anything stickers on the book comes off without a trace. It takes minutes.",

Its spot on with so many of its comments on humanity, and how they react to something spreading like Covid. The book is done from the perspective of a UN worker tasked with compiling as much of the \"war\" as they can to stop it happening again, so every chapter is a short story on a new characters personal experience with the outbreak. From the beginning when people realised what was happening, to the collapse of civilization and through to when humanity decides to fight back. \n\nThe movie, while passable, is an extremely poor adaptation. The books are smart and unique take on a super saturated zombie genre, what we got instead was a \"brad pitt saves the world with a bad haircut and survives a 747 crash\".",

It was entirely plausible that society would be afraid of them despite their inherent usefulness. Now it's 2004, and your audience drives cars built by robots and has grown up with humanoid robots on screen (C-3PO, Data). Asimov's world is no longer plausible. So the attitudes towards robots shifts,  and now Del Spooner's distrust of robots is the anamoly. The rest of the story then holds up as a thought experiment of the practical application of the Three Laws (which is really all the stories were, anyway). Using VIKI, they were even able to incorporate an early version of the Zeroth Law of Robotics, which R Daneel Olivaw develops in some of the Foundation prequels.",

There's a marketing term that basically applies to seeing the same thing over and over again until it becomes white noise and we stop noticing it. It's like when you don't notice a TV show that's been on for years and then once you get into it, you start seeing the marketing everywhere. The same applies for books. \n\nIf I go to Barnes three times in a month, the books being promoted as new/popular/promoted/whatever will eventually mentally fade into the background, just another book on a shelf. Changing the book cover is the publisher breaking through that mindset to get a third, fourth, fifth wave of readers interested who might have gotten adjusted to the previous cover. \n\nFor example, look at Ready Player One (I know, people here view it with distain); the book has been out for nine years but gone through something like four or five cover designs that change with the popularity. The first is a minimal design with a literal easter egg hidden, followed by a more dystopian city skyline to appeal to the YA audience, then a more video game-themed design, followed by the movie tie-in, and now it's back to a video game-based design to look like Tron. \n\nEach redesign was deliberate, either to promote the movie or to lean more into what readers liked. I'd prefer if, at least for eBooks, they allowed people to pick and choose which covers they want but that would require whole new contracts. There are covers to Harry Potter I love, and they're currently not the ones displayed on my Kindle.",

But I'd rather them keep the original art and put the burst saying now a major motion picture with a reduced size image of the movie poster in the corner.

Not that the cover \"makes\" a book (as if there was some saying about judging a book by its cover) but if the book released and is established under that cover, there's really no need to change it.    \nFlip side of that coin, different releases could change the cover so then wouldn't just having a movie release with the movie cover not matter then?  \n\nAn example is that my copy of brave new world is simply a plain white cover with the title on it.  I think the simplicity of it speaks volumes and goes with the book well.  But without a different cover I never would have gotten that version. So maybe it's not all that bad and I need to stop having knee jerk reactions to stuff like this.",

            "comment": "I don't like them either, and always make it a point to seek out the original covers when buying books for my personal collection even if they're a little more expensive, but movie tie-in covers are a necessary evil when it comes to marketing. It's been proven time and time again that they work and almost always lead to higher sales numbers. I don't know the exact reasoning, but if I had to take an educated guess I'd say that the average person, especially one who doesn't read all that often, either buys the book because they're already a fan of the movie/TV show, or because they're assuming that if a book is good enough or popular enough to get an adaptation, it's more likely to be worth a read.\n\nAgain, I don't buy into it personally, but if it gets people interested in reading and supports the author then I'm not going to complain about it too much either",

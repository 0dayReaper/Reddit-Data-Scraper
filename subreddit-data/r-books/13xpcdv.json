    "postText": "one of the other books I was reading when I was travelling in London and recently finished was Elena Ferrante\u2019s \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d. This book reads like a memoir, to the point where I\u2019m not actually sure if it\u2019s fiction or non-fiction, and tells the emotional tale of two friends, Elena and Lila, growing up together through strife and happiness in the more poverty-stricken areas of Naples. It was definitely a beautiful book to bring to Europe \u2014 all the lush descriptions of markets and the seaside made for great company. It delivers such emotional passages and the anger and frustration that can come with class division even within a single town. The first fifty or so pages were a bit slow, but otherwise I was hooked despite me not loving it as much as other reads and movies I saw connections to (in terms of content) such as Eugenides\u2019s \u201cMiddlesex\u201d and Studio Ghibli\u2019s \u201cOnly Yesterday\u201d. I also applaud it for its dynamic showing of innocence transforming into knowledge, maturity developing from ignorance. Overall I\u2019d recommend picking this one up, despite me not knowing if I would read the next one (it was quite a heavy read, so if anything I would return to this series after a break). \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

I love the whole series. What a fantastic sense of place. It is interesting to look up the actual area of Naples. I\u2019d love to go there! HBO did a fantastic adaptation, if you are interested.",

The language is beautiful, the gripping passages are full of tension, and the descriptions of personalities are simply addicting. If this is \"chick lit\" please give me more. The novels make me want to learn more about post-war Italy, too.\n\nI want to give the TV series a go but somehow can't get the subtitles correctly set. Though completely without Italian language skills, I do wish to hear the formal vs \"dialect\" original languages.",

Their friendship is so intense, in a way that I struggle to understand, I half wondered if they were secretly in love with each other. Their lives would be much easier if they ran away together, thats for damn sure",

I can\u2019t recall a single person online or in real life saying that they didn\u2019t like the book or the series. \n\nI saw the series first, and the books came after I had already started to watch it on TV. And I didn\u2019t like it - I felt a bit like an alien because it seemed everybody else loved it, entirely. So I figured that maybe there is a point where I will like it, because some people did admit that they struggled in the beginning. And I wanted to understand the high popularity and see what happened in the next book.\n\nBut nope - read all the books, didn\u2019t like the series. I\u2019m probably just an anomaly and definitely don\u2019t finish books anymore if I don\u2019t like them.",

I'd read comments from reviewers saying they couldn't put it down or whatever and like, this book is many things but it ain't a page-turner. It's really slow, and kinda plot less. Which is fine, but the marketing and hype I felt was really misleading and it kinda made me annoyed with the book. \n\nI will say, it's a year since I read it and although I found it a slightly frustrating read, I have appreciated it more now I've had some distance from it and a recent trip to Italy inspired me to maybe go back and read the next one but maybe with a more realistic view going in this time!",

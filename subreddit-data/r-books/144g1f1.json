This may be okay for novels but, does anyone annotate books? I'll often read something in the 'Atomic Habits' genera and I like to mark up and underline.",

I read upwards of 100 books per year.  No way am I paying for all those, when I'm only going to read them once- couldn't justify it, let alone afford it.  \n\nI read fast, so the return time is never an issue, but if it ever is, I can renew most of the time.  The wait for brand new books can be long if you don't get in quick, but I rarely read new stuff and I'd rather wait for weeks than shell out $20 - $30 for a new book again I might only read once.  I just could never justify spending that.\n\nI was forced to annotate books in high school and I hated it.  I take my notes outside the actual pages.  I love annotating poetry, but again, not in the book itself- on a copy separate from the actual book it's in.  I also never highlighted textbooks, just not my style and never worked for me.\n\nLibrary first, if I love it and will re-read it at least twice, then I'll go source a used copy or rarely a new copy.  If I can't get it from the library (rare, but it happens because I read obscure stuff a lot), then I'll source as cheap a used copy as I can find.  There's maybe one or two authors who for a specific series I know I love I'll buy new, but that's the exception, not the rule.",

And some people like to savor, and I get that, too.  \n\nWhenever I come across a book I really want to read but can't find at the library (our system is pretty extensive, so it happens but it's not super common thankfully), I will source as cheap a copy as I can- usually used, but whatever's cheapest.  So I do buy, just rarely.  And if I come across one I adore, and I want on my shelves, then I will go buy a copy, but only after I've library'd it.

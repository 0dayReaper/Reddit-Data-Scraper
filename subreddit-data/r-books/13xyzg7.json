    "postText": "**3/5 stars**\n\nAmerican Loyalist Troops 1775\u201384 is a long, boring and dry compilation of every known unit of Loyalist troops in the war and whether they used red, green or blue coats. The Osprey veteran Ren\u00e9 Chartrand packs as much information as he could find to fill this 48 pages Man-at-Arms book. The resut is an endless list of unit names with a stub of one or two short paragraphs detailing basic pieces of uniform like buttons, coat facings and other memorabilia of interest only for modellers and reenactors.\n\nIt doesn't read as the usual Ren\u00e9 Chartrand book, and is clearly below his high standards. The list of units is too long and most of the information is too vague for the narrative to flow normally. The plates are okay, but nothing outstanding. In one of the good plates (E3) a ranger from Jessup's Loyal Rangers stands above a bluecoat he killed in the bush. Plate A2 has a black ex-slave of the Ethiopian Regiment with \"Liberty to Slaves\" written on his shirt. The rest is very repetitive and bland.\n\nThe photographs of pieces of cloth, flags and portraits are too dark and blackened to be useful. One portrait of LtCol Banastre Tarleton is well represented, which is nice. The portrait of Thayeadanegea (Joseph Brant), the Mohawk Chief, is too dark to be useful.\n\nThe loyalists are described as being a no insignificant 20% of the population in the original 13 Colonies and coming from recent migrants from Britain, public servants, landowners and businessmen with strong ties with the metropole, freed black slaves and ordinary citizens that felt the Crown would protect their rights better than \"the rampaging advocates of 'Liberty,' who in practice often turned violently upon anyone who disagreed with their arguments.\" Since the revolutionaries were quick to seize property of those who opposed the independence, and massacred loyalist troops and hanged loyalist officers, that's not far fetched.\n\nThe main contributions of the loyalist \"Tories\" was to provided highly accurate intelligence, light infantry and cavalry units that placed the revolutionaries in a plain field for a larger, more powerful regular British army to maneuver and fight in the bigger battles; with many ranger and loyal regiments and legions. Without the French and the Spanish there is no way the 13 colonies would have won. The most effective loyalist units were the Butler's Rangers, the British Legion, the Loyal American Legion and the Queen's Rangers. Other units have pompous names like \"Royal Fencible Americans\" and \"Emmerich's Chasseurs\". Some units were big enough to fight in pitched battles while many others were too small to anything but understrength garrison duty. The main commands were New York, Canada and the Caribbean, all three conducting their operations independently.\n\nThis book's subject is too vast and should have been done in three volumes so each region could be explored properly, from the Canadian wilderness to the more adventuresque Caribbean fighting against the Spanish. The odyssey of United Corps of Pennsylvania &amp; Maryland Loyalists is quite interesting, being sent to Pensacola via Jamaica, they were captured by the Spanish in Pensacola and sent as prisoners to Havana, in Cuba. Being exchanged they were sent back to New York until resettled in New Br\u00fcnswick after the war.\n\nOddballs were French Canadian settlers who were forced into service, including with threats from conscripting two married men to each deserter, and Indians serving with the British; given that expansion into Indian lands was a major factor in the deflagration of the war it is easy to see why.\n\nThe book ends with the loyalists being ressettled as units, accompanied with their families, into British Canada. The British governament cared for them until their communities became self-sustained. Many had been persecuted and had their property seized; some were murdered. Five great fleets resettled over 35,000 loyalists and their families in Canada. A woman is mentioned as not having shed a tear during the war but being overcome by grief as, while holding her baby, she watched the ships that resettled them sail away; but doesn't really quote what she said. Page 40 depicts a draft of loyalists drawing lots for their land alongside their wives. After all lots were set, the units were disbanded. Chartrand then presents a vast bibliography and the plate details.\n\nThe mindset of those men and women really warrant further study, such as a Warrior title. Recently Osprey announced a Combat title and that's a good thing. Ren\u00e9 Chartrand ends his narrative with the words \"Indeed, although the fact is largely unappreciated in present-day Canada, it was the Loyalists who brought north many of the basic political and cultural institutions that now largely define the modern nation. Like the French-Canadians they joined in their new country, the Loyalists surmounted the consequences of a lost war, and built a new and forward-looking society that preserved their ideals.\"",

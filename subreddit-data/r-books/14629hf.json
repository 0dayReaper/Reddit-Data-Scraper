I also see a lot of people online read fast. I often pressure myself to read faster when I'm reading. I also usually put on soothing relaxing music for reading to increase my reading speed. Is there something wrong with me, or is this normal??",

The amount you read per session or day is totally dependent on what you want and have available. The speed you read at should be natural 95% of the time.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an issue with attempting to read a bit faster to exercise your brain but I\u2019ll usually do that with long Reddit or news stories instead of books.",

Not everyone is a speed reader - honestly, there have been books it's taken me months to finish, simply because I can't focus my attention on it, while there are others I'll rip through in hours. A lot is dependent on the book, my available reading time, environment, etc. So long as it works for you, the rest is unimportant.",

As I get fatigued (because reading is an active process).  I'll slow down so I don't generally read anything in a day \n So even though it takes me maybe 5 hours to read a book does not mean I do it in one shot. \n\nAs far as comic go they take me about an your or so to read.  If it's larger (omnibus or just a larger print).  Maybe a day or so.  But the same rules follow read until I can't focus then stop.  \n\nOverall there generally isn't a rule of how slow is too slow (although thr average is 260 wpm)  \n\nIt's all about your enjoyment and retention of the ideas in the book.",

If it takes a year to read one book, it takes a year, if you pound down three novels a week and that works for you that\u2019s good too. The more you read though you do tend to improve over time, which is a nice benefit. Like a muscle, reading improves the more you use it.",

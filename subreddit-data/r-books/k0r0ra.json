While he did inherit the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he didn't successfully wind down either, and he got involved in new conflicts in Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Western Africa. He did attempt to pull out of Iraq in 2011, but this held disastrous consequences, and resulted in a significantly intensified campaign against ISIS, that wasn't completed until after his presidency concluded.",

They refused to sign a Status of Forces agreement, the legal basis for occupying the country. Without the agreement the US was forced to withdraw troops since the sovereign nation of Iraq didn't want them there.\n\nThe US being involved in Western Africa goes back well before Obama as well. US involvement in Yemen predates 2008 too. He did expand both of those campaigns though.",

As the title suggests, the theme is very much the ideal of America that Obama held prior to office coming into blunt contact with the pragmatic realities of governance. The tone is much more sombre than his previous two books, but there's a lot of light-heartedness as well. He takes pride in some achievements and chastises himself for other failures, and talks about Sarah Palin as a sort of precursor to Trump. He talks about the impact of his presidency on his marriage and family, but Michelle's little interludes are all delightful - you can tell she and the girls really help him stay grounded. My favourite parts are the little portraits of other world leaders, actually; you can tell he has an immense respect for Merkel while his take on Sarkozy is pretty lol.\n\nI'd read it especially if you're interested in geopolitics and the idea of America vis-a-vis other nations, especially the Middle East. You get a really good sense of his foreign strategy philosophy and reasoning.",

His middle east policies basically radicalized the region and turn Libya into a failed state with active slave markets in the 21st century, expanded domestic surveillance, deported a record number of illegal immigrants, failed to secure any real long term banking reforms after they all but destroyed the economy, and he failed to stop the radicalization of the Republican party by normalizing their outlandish behavior. His signature accomplishment is the ACA, which really only stopped practices that should have been absolutely criminal but did little to nothing to actually fix the healthcare system. \n\nI will give him credit for the Iran deal, although Kerry did most of the leg work on that, Obama was at least smart enough to appoint Kerry and basically give him free rein.",

You're going to blame Obama for the GOP's behavior? The radicalization of that party had been decades in the making before Obama was even a senator, let alone the president.\n\nHe only had a Democratic majority for two years and could barely unify them, and then the next six years he had the most obstructive Congress of our lifetimes so maybe he should be compared to other presidents who served with a split Congress and not presidents like FDR who had their ideals rubber-stamped. Every presidency will look awful if you only list the negative things that happened during their terms.",

While, he was promoting his ACA in America he was fighting against cheaper medicines for the third world. \n\n[How Obama's double standards could make your healthcare costlier - India News , Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/india/how-obamas-double-standards-could-make-your-healthcare-costlier-376854.html) \n\n \n\n&gt;According to a report by [*Huffington Post*](http://livepage.apple.com/), the Obama administration, particularly the US Patent and Trademark Office, has flexed American political muscle to compel India to change its recent decision that led to the lowering of the price of a cancer drug Nexavar, originally made by German pharmaceutical company AG-Bayer. Of course, India hasn\u2019t changed anything, but neither did its citizens know that there was a lot of haggling from the Americans.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Earlier this year](http://www.firstpost.com/politics/hamied-does-it-again-will-ciplas-cancer-price-cut-transform-healthcare-298592.html), the price of Nexavar in India fell to Rs. 8,800 from Rs. 2.8 lakhs for the dose of a month following a compulsory license issued by the government of India to a local company called Natco. Natco will produce copies of the drug in India and pay 6% royalty to Bayer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Following this price fall, another local company Cipla, dropped the price of the generic version of the same drug, which it was selling earlier at Rs. 28,000, for a month\u2019s dose, to Rs. 6,600. Effectively, the compulsory license has led to a 97% fall of the price of the lifesaving drug.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Profiteering multinational drug companies and international drug lobbies will certainly consider this as an unfair loss although hard-fought international trade regimes (TRIPS) do provide for such flexibilities for countries such as India.",

His strength, always lay in his ability to speak and promote his ideas through his character regardless if they were right or wrong. Its not wonder he can sell books and such like gold.\n\nThat said, he receives way, way more credit then he deserves. While many of his policies were cheered or held up, there was an equal or greater amount of backlash towards what he did.

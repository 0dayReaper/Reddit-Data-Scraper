            "comment": "[The Imperfectionists](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6834410) by Tom Rachman\n\nI was young and stupid and legitimately convinced myself that I was too cool for most fiction. That if an author wanted to tell me something, they should provide me a real example that could be backed up by some actually measurable statistics.  \nAnd then I read *The Imperfectionists*. I don't want to give anything away about it, but there's a moment where a character comes to realize that his friend just wasn't the person he thought he was. Not that he turned out to be a villain or something, but that he had this picture in his mind and the reality is that his friend fell well short of it. That some of what he had found so attractive about this friend was actually a show.  \nI remember reading it and flashing back to a moment when I experienced something similar in my own life. And that's when fiction, literature really clicked for me. Yes, the author does have something to say and, yes, you do learn that over the course of their work. But the thing that it's *really* useful for is finding out about yourself.\n\nChanged everything for me. Ended up going back to school and getting a degree in English Literature. In those classes is where I met my wife. It's wild.  \nNot only did I have this really profound emotional moment in reading it, but I can 100% point to that experience as being the thing that changed the trajectory of my life. And all because I happened to pick up this book, really on a whim.",

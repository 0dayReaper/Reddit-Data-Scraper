I just scare easily and I'm not good with reading something knowing that there's something lurking in the coming pages - I don't know if that makes sense.\n\nBut anyway, I'm considering expanding my horizons and giving different genres, and I'm wondering-from the people who love Crime and Thriller novels, what do you love the most about them?",

I just love the mystery behind that. The fact that each page and chapter is adding new clues to the case is just a unique feeling for me. My most recent reads are Scandinavian noire, specifically Jo Nesbo and Camilla Lackberg and I would 100% recommend them!",

Sometimes a twist or two along the way. Of course some of the best books will completely subvert this.\n\nAs others have said, start with Agatha Christie.",

This makes it all the more horrific but essentially all the more engaging for me.\n\nI like the cops who are on the trail to be flawed too. This makes the stories feel more realistic to me.\n\nI think there was a period in the 90s for crime stories to be slick. And the crimes to be all high-tech and corporate.\n\nI have tried to read some of these and they just come across as tired and dull.\n\nI like my crime books to be in the gutter.\n\nIt's interesting how many crime writers write in a very literary style. Much of the crime stuff I read I think is very well written.\n\nCurrently reading February's Son by Alan Parks and it is great.",

Like I said above, I'm more into the sci-fi genre, but I like a certain realism to be present in them as well. Greyed characters make for a more lived in experience, so I can see how that translates within crime.\n\nWhat is power? Does it corrupt? Who is truly the 'villian'? I love stories that make you see that nothing is black and white, and when you're in a certain situation, even with the best of intentions, it all gets muddled",

They'll just have this pages upon pages upon pages of section on how police are working. Takamura for instance will follow a cop for twenty dense pages of doing police work and then for few pages have him go home and play violin. It's not for everyone but this makes the crime novels so immersive.",

As an example: one of the world's most powerful leaders is Vladimir Putin. He is also a crime boss, and I don't think many would dispute that statement. Crime is an activity that people of every income bracket partake in. We read to see if they'll get away with it; how the protagonists will stop it; and what we can learn about our world by knowing the details of that particular crime.",

Part of it was authors like Asimov who would cross into mystery genre, part of it was authors like Jack McDevitt incorporating mystery elements into science fiction narratives. And part of it was readers who bounced from one genre to the other.\n\nFor me, the brain teasing nature of a good mystery is the same sort of enjoyment I get from a brain teasing science fiction work. I think both sorts of works access the same parts of the brain, and you walk away sated.",

            "comment": "For me, there can be a pretty big difference between crime and thriller. They might be in the same book, or they might not. I have read a lot of true crime, and honestly real life is way worse than anything you'll read in fiction. If you don't like that type of anticipation, then they might not be the best genres for you. Within crime, you can read books like Mindhunter by John Douglas which is a true crime, told from the perspective of one of the first FBI profilers. It doesn't read like a novel where you are waiting for the result, you usually know it upfront and then learn how he went through the process of identifying the victim and offender. But, ti can be pretty gruesome so it might not be for you. For thrillers, like already mentioned it is the anticipation that I enjoy in reading them. The same reason why I like thriller and horror movies. Why, exactly, I don't know \ud83d\ude06 As a kid I was terrified I'd be a victim of a home invasion murder or something, and so scary movies helped me to come to terms with my irrational fear. But it's one of those things where if you know you won't enjoy it, then it's probably not worth your time. If you hate rollercoasters, why spend your time and money on a rollercoaster theme park? Kind of the same idea. There are a lot of options in genres that don't have to be thrillers that make you uncomfortable. I love memoirs, for example, because I love hearing people's stories. Even when the author is completely opposite of me, I appreciate their story and how they tell it.",

    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many \"suggest some books\" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!\n\n**The Rules**\n\n* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.\n\n* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.\n\n* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.\n\n____\n\n**How to get the best recommendations**\n\nThe most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.\n\n____\n\nAll Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.\n\nIf this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.\n               \n- The Management",

            "comment": "One of my favorite motifs in books and movies are abstract representations of oceans and flooding. I only know of two books like this, one is Piranesi by Susanna Clarke which I am currently reading, and the premise is the protagonist lives in a world that is a massive house where the upper levels are home to the clouds and skies and the lower levels hold a trapped ocean that frequently floods. Another book I read was The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman, I read it when I was a child so I don\u2019t fully remember the plot but I do remember there was an abstract/surrealist portrayal of a pond as an ocean. A movie that I\u2019ve watched that has abstract ocean/flooding motifs is the Chinese animated movie Big Fish and Begonia, where there are mythical creatures living in a magical world whose sky connects to the ocean of the human world. These mythical creatures are able to transform into dolphins and swim through their sky to the human ocean, and at the end of the film, the human ocean breaks through their sky and starts flooding their world. If anyone gets the gist of the abstractness of the ocean/flooding motif described in these books and film, I would really appreciate any book recommendations that have similar themes and imageries &lt;3",

It's probably my favorite book ever. Check out the first chapter and see if his style is something you could get into.\n\nMore recent, but still not new, The Martian is a hilarious, engaging story. If you're even remotely into science, it's an incredibly entertaining and intelligent book. I've lent it to teenagers and adults. They all praise it after they blast through it in days!",

The Readers of Broken Wheel Recommend by Katarina Bivald is also a breezy read for book lovers. The Pull of the Stars by Emma Donoghue is a great historical fiction option, it's set in 1918 which I feel like is a relief from all the WWII ones.

I'm not sure how the little bits if comical danger (ogres, dragons, etc.) in \"The Hobbit\" or the more serious danger (wights, ghosts, a coming apocalypse) in the Lord of the Rings would interact with your anxiety.

Without going into specifics, are you seeking professional help to cope with the anxiety or triggers? And you're not being cowardly, you're protecting yourself the way you know how.\n\nIf you do decide to try either of the books, I'd recommend \"The Hobbit\" first. I'm not trying to disparage you by saying this, but it's written as a children's book. Short chapters (20-30 pages), little explanations that sound kind of like the grandfather from the \"Princess Bride\" movie that help diffuse some of the tension, as well as an overall light-hearted feel to the book (some dwarves acting a touch silly, ogres arguing and fighting each other, etc.).\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to disparage or discount you by saying it's written as a children's book but because of the reasons above it's something I like to read when I get worn out by the history I read.",

I'd like to see the other characters support and convince them that they do deserve this love. It would be perfect if the story focuses on a long-term relationship and the healing process from trauma. An excellent example of this is Jude from 'A Little Life' or Lupin from 'All The Young Dudes.' \nThank you all in advance for any suggestions!",

Love kingkiller for the story, the magic, the prose.  I would love it for the plot, but I hate an open ending. Will probably read everything Sanderson puts out, the plots tend to be just the right amount of foreshadowing without being too obvious, or too deus ex.. also a big fan of the hard magic systems and worldbuilding he does. Recently finished the first first law trilogy and was.. whelmed. The action was cool, the grimdark just felt a little pale (and that\u2019s what it\u2019s \u201csold\u201d on), however I did thoroughly enjoy the characterization. Enjoyed black company for the story, if not the magic. Elderlings I found a touch slow. Dark tower was a little too \u201cintroduce problem in book, introduce solution in book\u201d, which I guess will happen when you have no idea what your next book is about and don\u2019t write it for a decade or so at a time. Wheel of time is a goat, but expect the typical mutterings about braids etc. gentleman bastards was a fresh take, that became really repetitive with subsequent books. Also once again, not a huge fan of such a soft magic system. \n\n\nCurrently considering powder mage or lightbringer, but neither is jumping out at me atm. \n\nMost important to me: 1. plot- I prefer a plot that has layers, maybe you have to unravel it to make it make sense. Love it when foreshadowing is rewarded on a reread, or it \u201cclicks\u201d when you get the twist. Not a fan of deus ex machina plots\n\n2. magic (preferably hard magic, but can happily fall for soft- see malazan), characterization, prose (simple language makes for a quick and easy read, beautiful prose makes the simple act of reading rewarding)\n\n3. worldbuilding - being at the bottom of the list shouldn\u2019t be mistaken with being unimportant. Excellent worldbuilding usually, to me, means that so much else has gone right above it. However, I can fall into the camps if people who are frustrated when reading LOTR, or books 7-9 of WoT, for a bit too much slog. \n\nThanks in advance!",

And as for  powder mage it was ok but i personally found it bit boring.  \n\n\nI also recommend The Demon Cycle by Peter V. Brett specially first book The Warded Man, though the series in my opinion got weaker as it went by still worth the read.  \n\n\nCan also look into Raven's Shadow (book 1 - Blood Song) Anthony Ryan though another series that fumbled the ending.\n\nCan look into Mark Lawrence works with original series Broken Empire and then other series coming out in the same world  \n\n\nThose are quite well know series so i will leave you with one of my recomendations that isnt well known that i actually really like, series like a month ago came out book 4 so i recently read it -  Saga of the Forgotten Warrior (book 1 - Son of the Black Sword) by Larry Correia",

It was very buzzy when it came out and is still a pretty popular pick when it comes to gender identity. \n\nIf you like sci-fi and have the patience to explore an immersive, unfamiliar world, I'd recommend *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin. It's part of her larger Earthsea series but it can be read as a standalone (which I did). The world described in it treats gender very differently and it really dismantles traditional notions of gender. Regardless of where you stand on the question of gender identity, I think the very least each of these books do is show that there's more than one way of approaching the topic.",

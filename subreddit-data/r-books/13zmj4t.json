    "postText": "It was good.  Not ground breaking.  But good. \n\nLet start with the good. \n\nThey made a book about etymology really freaking interesting.  They made a soft magic system that had rules that were clearly defined and made some level of sense.  The footnotes were a good way to keep the tone of the book while expanding the world without taking time in the narrative to explain it.  I did enjoy the narrative and the characters though some of the motivations came out of left field. \n\nMild Complain:  subtly is not a strong suit.  As soon as Robin got spirited away to England you knew what was going to happen.  When they introduced a character you knew what they were.  There was little room for surprise and I don't know if it's because I'm a big watcher of movies that I can spot Chekov guns easier or it was meant to be that way so we didn't end up with a 2500 page series of books. (Which I'm happy for).  \n\nOverall it's a 3/5 (pushing 3.5)  but in my scale means that I would suggest this book for someone who likes this particular genre or wants to branch out to this genre (light fantasy/dark academia) which I think is a good starting point unlike handing them The Secret Histroy or If We Were Villians which don't give you the historical context and expect you to know it.",

The etymology felt like it was written with a different level of passion and care that kept you interested, even when you wouldn't be expected to. The characters were very face value, but I think the focus was more about how do you choose, who are you all these years later and removed from your roots. I think it handled those questions well.",

            "comment": "Here is one thing I couldn't get past: it's mentioned that the magic system has been in use since the Roman Empire, and yet the history of that world is almost identical to ours. Victorian Britain in 'Babel' uses technology that's basically the same is it was in the real world, just powered by the silver magic instead of steam and coal, which to me feels like lazy worldbuilding. I found it to be an enjoyable story, but one that didn't fully utilize the potential of its premise.",

The main characters acted like modern people who somehow found themselves in the 19th century. I don't think the Chinese would have acted particularly nicely if they were the superpower- then or now. But not having them take advantage then does prove the baddies point- even if that was absolutely not the authors intention.",

I didn\u2019t mind too much that it lacked subtlety, but I was disappointed that a lot of the characters felt flat. Many of them felt like generic good guys or generic bad guys without much to distinguish them from one another. They were distinct only in the didactic function they played in the debates over the themes. Robin was the only character that felt real and dynamic to me. Maybe Ramy and Professor Lovell to a lesser extent. But so many characters blended together to me, and then we were expected to be devastated when they died etc, but I didn\u2019t feel connected enough to care that much. So that was disappointing to me. &gt;! I also wish Letty being evil wasn\u2019t so heavily telegraphed from the first moment she stepped on the page. Like, that betrayal should have been devastating, right? But she was consistently a bad and unlikable person, and Robin, Ramy, and Victoire basically spent the whole book hating her guts. So she betrayed them and it was like\u2026 well. Yeah, obviously. !&lt; But over all, was a fun and engaging read, and I gave it 4 stars.",

I find the morally grey, flawed types that end up doing the right thing regardless so much more interesting. It's also so much more realistic. Humans are complicated.\n\nAnd Robin did turn into the villain in the end. He turned from someone who showed compassion for the \"collateral damage\" of the opium war to not caring at all about the \"collateral damage\" he caused with his own actions. He just wanted to see the world burn. He had the poor working class right in front of his eyes and it never even occurred to him that THESE are the people who will suffer the most because of him ...",

Those aren't interchangeable. The book is very intentionally showing you how he got to that point and why he feels it's necessary. Whether or not he \"becomes a villain\" at the end isn't a question that's settled by the book ... it's a question that the book raises and leaves open-ended. As is the more general question of whether or not rebellions are justified in using collateral damage in their fights to end much larger systems of harm.\n\nYou're saying the characters in this book are too black and white, but then you're taking a character whose actions the book specifically treats as morally gray and painting them as much less nuanced than they actually are.",

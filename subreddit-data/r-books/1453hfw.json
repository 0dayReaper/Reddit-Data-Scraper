Lara Prescott.\n\n'Dark Star' and 'Night Soldiers' by Allan Furst.  Soviet agents in the early days of WW2.  Atmospheric and beguiling.\n\n'The Warlord's Son' and 'The Prisoner of Guantanamo'  post 9/11 spy stories that aren't badly recycled Cold War tales.\n\nNon-fiction.  \n\n'Hollywood Double Agent'  by Jonathan Gill.  Reads like a spy story co-written by Mel Brooks and Ian Fleming.  The true story of a fat, bald Jewish Russian who hung out with the Tsar and Rasputin and with Laurel and Hardy.  I had to check five different sources before I believed it wasn't a gag.",

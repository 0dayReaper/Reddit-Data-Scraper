    "postText": "It's been such a long time since I read any novels or short stories. I've been focusing on other stuff. I saw the book in a book store and thought to myself \"it's really time I read this book\".\n\nI enjoyed it. It's been so long since I felt such a variety of emotions reading!\n\n-In the start, I loved reading about the dystopia and how utterly oppressive it felt. I love how Winston felt something was wrong simply out of intuition.\n\n-The love story was honestly great and beautiful. It was really unexpected. I would say that when the love story *really* starts, it felt odd and out of place to me, but at the same time it did start a whole different complex theme which was very interesting. Winston reveling in the concept of corruption was very unique to me and unexpected! I also think it was a good way to contrast Winston's earlier innocence.\n\n-Probably one of my favorite parts of this book is the archetypes. There are 4 clear ones which I feel can be somewhat universal; Winston, Julia, Parsons and Syme. I think the first time I noticed it was during Winston's and Julia's discussions. How they both were against the Party, but differently. Winston is an idealist with good intuition, a budding intellectual. He has the curiosity of a child and also its intelligence, but not in a bad way. It's not-academic, but philosophical in a manner which feels second nature.\n\nJulia cares nothing for the world. This would be different if she were stupid, but she isn't. She's smart, and very savvy, but her only concerns are her own. \"You're a rebel from the waist downwards\" is very accurate. She's the hedonist.\n\nParsons is the buffoon. What's there to say about him? Syme is the one who's too smart for his own good, but doesn't realize it. He's a true intellectual, but his lack of intuition and weak philosophical side didn't catch up to his learning and academia, which was his undoing. The archetypes were very interesting to me.\n\n-As exciting as the whole encounter was, *the book* was actually very boring. I didn't mind reading certain parts, but it was so dry and too long, I wish it gave more information about the world instead of talking about the philosophy.\n\n-It's kind of disappointing we don't hear more of the other \"Smith\" in the jail. Was she the one?\n\n-The philosophical conversations in the end got too long, but the descriptive writing was amazing. I almost wanted to cry reading what happened. It was so visceral and shuddering.\n\n-The whole idea of &gt;!having O'Brien lure in any dissidents by pretending to be the only counter-movement!&lt; is *ingenius!*\n\n-I don't what else to say. I'm running out of thoughts. The ending was really sad, I wish it could've ending on a higher note.\n\nI think I'll watch the movie. I heard there's one out there. Sorry for the disjointed points. I don't know if I ever posted here, but I read my first novel in years and I really enjoyed and wanted to share.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to ask this, but how did they know what he was thinking of in the final part? Did they have devices that can actually pick up thought? Or was the interrogator really good at reading people?",

(spoilers) If in the beggining, Winston starts by asking himself questions about life, him, his childhood, and ends up by being sincerely preocupied by the production of prime mater or something. It's what happens in our times, I think: we are distracted and forgot to ask questions, to question ourselves.",

And ig he has a time before the execution to further suppress him morally and psychologically that would affect person much more than a torture, because imagine counting days till ur death day :/ !&lt;\n\nThat was the book that made me love dystopian novels and have a looooong thought about &gt;!\u201cwhat if I had to be in the place of the man tortured by his greatest fears, would I sacrifices myself in the sake of truth or would I bend and break by this mental onslaught?\u201d!&lt;",

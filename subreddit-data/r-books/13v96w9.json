    "postText": "This, to me, is such a heart-wrenching novel that kept me anxious for days. The book so vividly describes the travails of nascent Christianity in the Tokugawa Shogunate (note: I'm a lapsed Christian), and not only does it explore the theme of religious martyrdom and its existential underpinnings, but it also attempts to elucidate the idiosyncratic Japanese mindset that prevents itself from succumbing to the allures of an alien faith and culture.\n\nFor those who have already read this book, would love to hear your insights!",

Valuable insight at one remove into the Korean national character, too: Korea became fervently Christian in part as resistance to Japanese colonialism.",

I\u2019m still working through my feeling about it, but what I found most interesting was the way it explored the nature of suffering, particularly the priest\u2019s struggle to balance his principles in the face of others\u2019 suffering. \n\nHaven\u2019t seen the film, but keen to. And curious about Endo\u2019s other work too. Not familiar with what else he\u2019s done.",

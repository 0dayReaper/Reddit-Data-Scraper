    "postText": "I just finished reading this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.\n\nThis post isn't really about the book in general, but about its vocabulary. I've noticed this same issue in many books I've read, where it feels as though the writer is trying to make a point by using really obscure words, but that point is completely lost on me.\n\nIn this case, the story is in first-person, so are we supposed to assume that the narrator is ... stuffy? Learned? Intellectual? Showy?\n\nIt's really not clear, because aside from those crazy words, he's not really any of those things. He's a professor of history at a middling university, but in his conversations, he seems like a normal, slightly self-effacing guy. He sort of calls out another character for using words like peripety and climacteric.\n\nBut then, the narrative leaves that behind, and hits us with tons of words just like that.\n\nSo what's the point? Maybe we're just supposed to think that the author is smart?\n\nI contrast this to books like Lolita, or The Debt to Pleasure (both of which I loved) where the high vocabulary and style is perfectly suited to, and complements, the character that we're learning about.\n\nHere are some of the words I mean:\n\nCathexes, strappado, carceral, horripilation, pentimento, sudorific, pelage, pontonier \\[EDIT: It was actually \"ponton\" as in: the car was ponton\\], capirote, hyemal,  lucubration...\n\nAnd then there were some that I knew (or kinda knew), but still classify them as difficult words: caudillo, nugatory, gloriole.\n\nLastly, he used some words in a weird way, so that I looked them up just to see if there was a definition that I was missing. Unfortunately, though I remember one was \"menial,\" I can't remember the context.\n\nAnyone else read this book and felt the way I feel?\n\nEDIT: \"logopoeic, propaedeutic, patriotic sentiments were emanating from her....\"",

In this case, as I mentioned, the issue isn't the words, but the lack of consistency between the words and the person speaking them.\n\nIt's like sex in a movie. I'm not a prude. I don't mind sex if it's good for the story. If it makes sense. But when they throw it in just for ticket sales, then it bugs me.",

Will you read this one all the way?\n\nOr my post. Not sure whether you noticed, but I mentioned Nabokov in my post. \n\nBut he didn\u2019t make Lolita (for one example) talk like a university professor. He was aware that different characters have different voices and different levels of vocabulary. \n\nWhen Nabokov, or any good writer, has a character use a certain level of vocabulary, it\u2019s not solely because of a love of language, but also because he wants us to understand something about that character. \n\nDifferent characters have different levels of vocabulary. \n\nFor some reason, you seem to think that I want to read ordinary words only and am complaining about learning new words. I can\u2019t understand how you\u2019d think that if you\u2019re actually reading what I write. \n\nThat\u2019s a complete misunderstanding of my point.",

Don't you?\n\nI could sit here and explain how you've badly misunderstood his character. I could quote a bunch of lines, or just describe stuff for you, but what's the point?\n\nAt every turn, you've either not understood (or read) what I was saying, or have told me that I must be wrong.\n\n*All about a book that you've never read.*\n\n&gt;The novel you're complaining about is narrated by history professor, so I would expect an erudite, even ridiculously so, voice\n\nI teach at a university and I have no clue what you're talking about. But the point isn't really what you'd expect, but what you actually GET. In all his dealings with people, he's not pompous or showy. He doesn't use language like that at all. Quite the opposite.\n\nBut you read \"the first few pages on the kindle sample,\" so you know what you need to know.\n\nNow you'll probably tell me how I just don't have your understanding of the work, because you read the blurb on the back.

From the New York Times review of The Netanyahus:\n\n&gt; I hesitate to say it\u2019s accessible, only because of the amount of unnecessarily blue-chip words that appear throughout. And here I\u2019ll take a paragraph on just this. It was unclear to me if these words appeared as a way to convey the character of Ruben Blum \u2014 maybe as a pompous professorial type? If so, it was lost on me, since the net result was the same: I lost some of the rhythm in a Sheol of internet vocabulary searches, though, to be clear, I do not cavil at these words, lest my own lesser vocabulary stick out like a carbuncle.

Plenty of people will says it\u2019s showing off but I try to give the benefit of the doubt in these cases, until proven otherwise. \n\nSome authors seem to just have a ridiculous vocabulary at their disposal, Phillip Freedenberg and Rick Harsch come to mind of the books I\u2019ve read recently. Used properly it can be amazing, Harsch is like no other (even Nobokov in my estimation) as far as choosing the absolute perfect word in relation to the words surrounding it, like two words together were just meant for each other.  And then of course there\u2019s precision, which is more common, making use of the vast English language at their disposal.  I\u2019ll admit it can be more difficult and slow things down, even less enjoyable, but in the long run I think it\u2019s a plus overall.  It\u2019s just my job to grow my vocabulary and enjoy authors that introduce me to more words.  I don\u2019t thing using ridiculous words is inutile but on the other hand surely some of them could do a better job of making things a bit more palatable. \n\nSuper abbreviated answer:  It\u2019s art.

The noun \"ponton\" is just an out-of-date way to spell pontoon. It's how some people spelled it in the 1800s and earlier. It's not an adjective, but ok, he used it that way.\n\nBut I don't think it means out of date at all in this context. I think it means it resembles a pontoon.\n\nAfter all, the novel is set in the 50s, so the car wasn't really that out of date. It was past its heyday, but it didn't mean old-timey.

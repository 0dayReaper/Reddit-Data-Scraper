Just for us and for fun. I was probably about 9 and he was 5. It was fun. One day the lady next door mentioned that she really liked a song on the radio and I had already taped it. I dubbed it onto another cassette and gave it to her. She brought it back a couple days later and said thanks, and that she really enjoyed the \"radio show\" on the b-side. I was mortified that she'd heard it at the time, but now I always remember and cherish the silly grin she had when she said it. Anyway, there's another random TMS story for you all.",

It was also a challenge - all the dialog had to be scientifically accurate, we couldn't use American metaphors (i.e., as big as a football field), and the jokes had to be kid funny (I hope). It took a bit of work, but I was fortunate enough to hear that my scripts were approved by the whole gamut: Microsoft Home, Scholastic, Inc., and Joanna herself, which still makes me proud to this day. I never met her, but I'm happy to have contributed in a small way to the world she made.",

We\u2019ve rewatched every episode of both series many times. When lockdown &amp; distance learning sapped all of his curiosity &amp; drive to learn out of him, we discovered the early reader chapter books that dove deeper into his favorite science topics &amp; reminded my kid how fun reading is.",

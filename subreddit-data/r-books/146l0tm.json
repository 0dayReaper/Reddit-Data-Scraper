    "postText": "I think it speaks volumes about an author's skill when I know what's coming, and yet I still feel empathy and horror for those involved. It's a 3,000 year old story. We all learned in school what happens to the ancient city of Troy. I knew what the end game would be; just not how it would play out.\n\nThe best way I could put it is like watching your dog die. I mean, you know eventually your dog will die, just not how. Imagine watching that play out in super slow motion. I feel absolutely defeated and burnt out. That's not to say this book is bad in any way; I've simply never reacted so strongly to any book I've ever read before.\n\nI share all this because the reality is I cannot recommend this series *enough*. I felt very satisfied by the conclusion and the series is self contained, so I won't be waiting 20 years for it to wrap up or any tangentially related spin-offs.\n\nI just wanted to share my quick thoughts because of how deeply I feel this story has impacted me.\n\nWell done and RIP, Mr. Gemmell.",

I was 17 when he passed away and I was gutted.\n\nI remember how sad I was when I finished the last Troy book because it was saying goodbye to his writing as well. Incredibly satisfying ending to a phenomenonal trilogy.",

I'd seen Legend as a kid and didn't know it was based on a novel. I'm not even particularly into fantasy, aside from GRRM. I much prefer techno-thrillers and the occasional military/sci-fi. But I rather enjoy most things related to Ancient Greece. About a year ago, I believe I stumbled upon someone asking, in this very sub, about novels pertaining to the ancient Mediterranean and the highest rated answer was this trilogy. I'm glad I went with my instincts on this one.",

When he died, I tried to find someone who would still scratch the same itch I had for his brand of fantasy, but I couldn't. Joe Abercrombie is the closest but he lacks Gemmell's leanness and directness.\n\nIt's hard to articulate the actual quality of Gemmell's writing that I liked so much. I wouldn't call him artful or a wordsmith by any means, and his world building merely is there to serve the story rather than create an intricate, complex world. But the guy wrote with a sort of relentless drive, almost like his life depended on it. I remember reading somewhere that his first book, Legend, was written when he thought he might have cancer, and the book was a metaphor for cancer battle. That sort of relentless desperation and drive to move forward is present in nearly all of his books and it never got old with me.",

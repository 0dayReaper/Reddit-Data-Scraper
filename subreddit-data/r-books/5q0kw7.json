                            "comment": "Putin would call what we're all experiencing now 'non-linear warfare' and it seems to fit well under the heading of Zizek's 'hyperreality.'\n\nThe thing with Brave New World is that it was a world where nobody cared that things were the way they were. It had both genetic manipulation and a caste system (plenty of people would argue we have some of both of that) and nobody minded. It medicated everyone with soma to keep them happy and complacent. People were expected to accept their predetermined station in life (like Snowpiercer.) I don't think it was so much that people didn't have access to the correct information, or couldn't get it if they wanted to - it was that they didn't care anymore.\n\nWith 1984 and Orwell, given the way the world is described, it's likely there were people other than Winston who 'understood' what was going on, or who 'woke up'. That's why the government had to be so all-pervasive and punished anyone who dissented heavily.\n\nBrave New World was basically a world that was supported by the populous (tyranny of the majority.) 1984 was an example of a tyranny, or harsh regime, like North Korea. In the long run, the former will be far more successful - and I think it already has been. The latter lends itself to collapsing and destabilizing when those in power pass on the reigns. The former has no worries - after all, it has democratic support.",

It's also written in simple English and you could knock it out in a night.\n\n\nWhat is fascism?- an essay he wrote about how the word fascism has been used to describe every political movement to the point it has lost meaning. Like all of Orwell, it is still highly relevant today.\n\nHomage to Catalonia- More than an account of the Spanish civil war from a soldier (which to this there are few unbiased accounts) it has some really eye opening political analysis at the beginning that gives a unique perspective of preWWII Europe. Also highly relevant today.\n  ",

Coming from a respectable family background in which the inherited wealth has now become dissipated, Gordon resents having to work for a living. The 'war' (and the poetry), however, aren't going particularly well and, under the stress of his 'self-imposed exile' from affluence, Gordon has become absurd, petty and deeply neurotic.\n\n",

It was a satire of anti-Communist propaganda in the US, which frequently implied making everyone economically equal was effectively the same as making everyone \"equal\" in every way, hence the \"handicaps\" present in Harrison Bergeron. Vonnegut was himself a proponent of socialism, so it's rather ironic that this work is so often thought of as anti-Communist.",

It even has built in criticism of communal work, political correctness, and everything people criticize the far left for.\n\nOrwell was, first and foremost, and anti-authoritarian. \n\nMy dream in life is that people will start hurling the correct insults at each other.",

You wait for the one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow.\nBut the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That's the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and the smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked \u00f6 if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \"43\" had come immediately after the \"German Firm\" stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \"33\". But of course this isn't the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\nhttp://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm",

    "postText": "Warning for heavy spoilers. I just finished this book last night. I'm an avid reader and have never been so confused by the ending of a book in my entire life. There's so many loose ends I'm struggling to tie up.\n\nThe ending strongly implies that Kya was responsible for Chase's murder. I looked up discussions on various forums but my question remains: How exactly did she pull this off? Was she the old man and the old woman on the bus? And sure, she knows about the ocean tides/etc., but would that truly afford her enough time to go murder a man and return to Greenville by bus? From what was said of the timeframe during the trial, it seems highly improbable (that's a super tight timeframe to commit such an act!).\n\nIn addition, although Kya is presented as a highly intelligent character, there is no exposition in the novel that suggests she is capable of the high level techical/logistical skills and skills of social manipulation that would be required to pull all of this off. It just doesn't quite add up. If there was mention of her reading murder mystery novels -- sure, that would make sense. But nothing like this was ever mentioned, as far as I can discern.\n\n....I also saw someone suggest that maybe Chase's wife Pearl was the one responsible for the murder, which makes some sense, including the motif of female violence in insect mating rituals, although it requires quite a bit of logical leapfrogging to explain the missing necklace then being found at Kya's house (did Pearl discard it there after the murder?...probably not).\n\nI suspected Tate most of the novel, as him somehow gaining access to her house would not be too surprising. In addition, there's the repeated motif of male dominance hierarchies. Perhaps the non-flashiness of Tate's reactions throughout the book indicate he indeed was the murderer, but, being the alpha male in the end, was stoic about it? Granted, that doesn't do much to explain his implied surprise at having found the compartment under the stove that held the necklace, which he would have had to place there.\n\nFollowing the train of thought that she did not commit the murder.....I believe that the poem at the ending of the book could be interpreted as being very on the nose or more imaginative. Perhaps this poem was just her expressing her feelings about his death, which, after the fact, I'm sure she was somewhat relieved at, given he was stalking and harassing her.\n\nBut honestly, all this being said, most of the plot points seem to suggest she was the murderer. I'm just so confused because of the technical improbabilities I outlined above. Can anyone come up with anything that makes it make sense so it can stop bothering me? Lol.\n\nDo you think the author intended the ending of this book to be somewhat ambiguous? Or the intended message all along was that it was Kya, but the novel, by technical error on the author's part, wasn't written in a way that eliminates all doubt by the end?",

The closes we got to that was the police officer's speculations about how she could have managed it. At the time, it's written as if he's grasping at straws to support his prejudice, but the ending reveals her dark side and suggests the speculations were closer than we were lead to believe.",

Because she was not formally educated most people discounted her intelligence, and she never denied she killed him, she just chose to remain quiet.",

But like you said, the timeline   \ndoesn't make logical sense. I understand that we're supposed to believe   \nshe learned to do all this from observing nature, but it's too much of a  \n logical leap for me. She's presented as a fairly socially naive   \ncharacter, who struggles with situations involving other people (many of  \n which were required to execute the murder as she did). Her killing of   \nChase wasn't purely instinctual in its execution. It's not that he was   \nthere and she struck. It was absolutely assassin-like. And yes, there was mention   \nof the manipulative tactics of female insects in mating rituals, and the  \n use of disguises in them as well -- but there were no motifs or scenes   \nthat showed Kya was garnering the tactical skills of a trained assassin   \nthrough her observations of nature. Maybe if there was, I would have an   \neasier time believing it. But even then -- 5 minutes?",

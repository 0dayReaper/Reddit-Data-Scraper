    "postText": "I was discussing my rationale for rating the books I read with my husband (not a reader) and I came to the conclusion that it\u2019s not fair to rank a book less than 5 stars let\u2019s say just because it\u2019s not my favorite genre. I love high fantasy and there were only a few that were perfect mind blowing 5 star reads but I also loved a bunch of others and don\u2019t think it would be fair to rate them less considering I wouldn\u2019t change anything in the story. The same goes with fiction books for me, I just finished Tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow and really enjoyed it, wouldn\u2019t change anything on it, but again, not my preferred genre. It seems so wrong to rate it 4 stars just because I like reading fantasy. I feel like I need to rank them as if the genre I\u2019m reading is my go to choice at that moment but at the same time I gave 5 stars to some of my reads that did not make to my all-time favorites. \n\nWhat do guys think? How do you rate your reads?",

But if a book impressed me because I enjoyed it a lot even though it's a genre I don't read much, I would probably give it an even higher rating.",

            "comment": "My ratings are based on how I feel while reading the book and they probably don't make sense to other people, but they don't have to. Generally if I rate a book 4 stars it's just because it didn't feel like a 5 star book to me, even though I enjoyed it a lot. I have books that I've rated 4 stars and when I think back on them I say that I love them and that they are amazing, but I still don't think they deserve 5 stars. I have books that I've rated 3 or 2 stars because that's how I felt while reading them and I say I hate them, but still don't think they deserve 1 star.\n\nIf I loved a book, but it made me feel negative emotions (sadness, anger, annoyance) I usually rate it 4 stars because I read in order to relax and and have a pleasant time, and feeling those negative emotions makes my reading experience less enjoyable. \n\nRating is subjective and there is no right or wrong way to rate a book. I've seen people rate books higher than they want to because other poeple like them or they are really popular and they feel bad to give them a lower rating. But if you didn't enjoy the book why give it a higher rating than you want to? If you read a book that isn't your preferred genre there's nothing wrong with rating it 4 stars instead of 5 solely for that reason. I don't think ratings necessarily have to be rational, go with what you feel and don't feel bad about it.",

I just explain what I liked and what I didn't like in a story to explain the rating. There have been books that I rated highly simply because of how much I loved 1 character. Books I ranked low because of a trope I couldn't stand. There have been books that I don't rate at all just because I am conflicted about my feelings and don't want to make a decision. I just go with the flow of my feelings basically.",

A book has to be fairly poor before I move it down to 2 stars. I\u2019ve only ever rated 1 book 1 star because usually if something is that bad to me I don\u2019t finish it.",

Would not recommend to others.\n\n1 - bad, I either did not finish or finishing it was agonizing, hard to understand(assuming it was not tackling difficult concepts), boring, immature and a bad voice, one dimensional characters. Would not recommend to anyone.\n\nI would recommend any books I rated with a score of a three or above.",

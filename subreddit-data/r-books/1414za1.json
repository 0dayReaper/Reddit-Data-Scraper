There's really not much closure.\n\nThis seems to be a thing he likes to do, I just started the third book of ambergris and I'm not sure there will be any closure about the grey caps. But imo it doesn't bother me and makes for good world building so I give it a pass.\n\nAnnihilation is definitely the best of the trilogy but the other 2 books are still interesting, just different.",

I thought it was going to become an all-time favorite series but didn't even end up picking up a copy of the first book. The sequels had so little payoff, very few explanations, and the narrative shift was so tedious in book 2. I had to force myself to push thru the audiobook in hopes the overall ending would be worthwhile. If you're really curious maybe look for a summary of Authority and just go to book 3. But I still wish I'd stopped after Annihilation.",

I was too curious not to.\n\nIf someone is gripped by the questions posed in Annihilation I\u2019d still recommend they read 2 and 3 as long as they were interested, but it\u2019s definitely a case of the whole being worth more than the sum of its parts, I think.",

Now, maybe it\u2019s my fault for being na\u00efve and lending books to people I *wanted* to be friends with rather than people I was already friends with, but the few that I have let people borrow I have never seen again. It\u2019s just heartbreaking because I want to share, but I trust no one. Can anybody relate?",

I read BlacKkKlansman in 2021 (a terrific, short, true story regarding Ron Stallworth's - a black police officer - implementation into the KKK by posing as a white man), I had a history teacher at school who I believed would like this book as she taught civil rights. However, I was no longer in school, so I couldn't just go in and give her it. Therefore, I lent it to a friend at the time who unceremoniously just left it in the cafeteria. What pissed me off was that I was handed the book, almost a year later, by another friend who found it during that lunch.\n\nThe second time involved another at the time friend who was going to study film. I'm a huge Stephen King fan and, therefore, decided to lend her The Shining as she was interested when I told her it's hugely different from Kubricks adaptation. Haven't seen it back. It's a special edition that isn't printed in the UK anymore, so I'm extra pissed. On the lighter side, the friend who found the first book at lunch is going to get it back in exchange for a loan of my copy of \"Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd\" which I've just finished.",

I used to play basketball with him at the Prescott YMCA every Friday afternoon. Dude had a killer jumper and he is so incredibly kind. I have a signed copy of 1 of his books lying around somewhere that says \"B_M_Fahrtz, keep writing and shooting.\" I hope he is treated well. He's a good man.",

I've been worried about Disney doing something like this ever since the acquisition. There was a case a couple years ago where it was ruled a studio didn't have to honor the terms of contracts signed before the acquisition, and used this to rob someone of their IP (I don't recall the details of the case at the moment, I may try to look for it later). Ever since then I've just been waiting for these mega-mergers to result in creators being screwed over by Disney.\n\nEdit: [Having looked it up, it wasn't a ruling but a motion for dismissal granted in a case over the film Gravity.](https://crimereads.com/suing-hollywood/) It's the same argument Disney is using now, that they acquired the assets but not the obligations that came with those assets.",

It's absolutely horrific and serves as another measure for studios to abuse the creators they so heavily rely on. It's insane.",

Pay the lawyers once to set precedence, then hypothetically never have to give a fuck about paying anyone else ever again. They're running under the assumption that Disney will continue on into the future indefinitely, so at some point, it's supposed to pay for itself. Beyond that, it's not really about the amount of money, but the power to do whatever the fuck you want with it. Disney does not want to be obligated to anyone or anything that isn't Disney. It's that simple. It wouldn't matter if the agreement was one penny per year, the fact that they *have* to do it is too much for them. The other part is it costs them more than a penny in labor to retain the people whose job it is to pay him the penny. So another law flouted today, another ounce of power usurped for a lifetime.",

I have family that works in the industry and have heard numerous stories of Disney (and others) optioning a show/film, then hiring a third party to create something similar for a fraction of the cost before dropping the optioned project. It allows them to look at a project they're interested in, but may cost more than they want to pay or may not give them the IP, then option it to pull it off the market so that it can't be pitched elsewhere. They then commission something similar so they can obtain the IP at a fraction of the cost and drop the commissioned project, run their knock-off into production while the previous project now has to start shopping around again, and is far less likely to get picked up because the company already has a similar show in the works",

They're saying that the contracts  for the books were between the authors and the publishers, and since Disney ended those productions upon buying the rights to the books and started new print runs with their own publishers, those original contracts are concluded and Disney has no relationship with the authors. \n\nTo be clear, i'm not saying i agree, just that's what Disney is arguing. From what i've read, their argument *may* have some standing as it's the specific situation of work-for-hire / ghost writers in which the relationship between publisher and author and rights holder are all a little murkier than usual. So who knows. Still fucked up, though.",

Authors and publishers generally can't screw each other in a similar way because authors typically license their own intellectual property to a publisher in exchange for an advance + royalties and a good-faith agreement to print and earnestly market the book, usually for either a fixed term or as long as the publisher keeps it in print. \n\nThis situation where one party owns all of the intellectual property but a third party is cut into a publishing deal is unusual; in at least one case, it seems like the contract was amended to add royalties purely out of goodwill, which does make sense:\n\n&gt; The original contract called for an upfront payment of $7,500, until Mr. Lucas tossed Mr. Foster a 0.5% royalty on sales that Mr. Foster, now 74 years old, says added up to several times that initial payment.\n\nIt does seem plausible that Disney isn't breaking the law, but is being a massive bag of dicks about everything. It kind of reminds me of when UFC gave some of their older fighters fake office jobs as a sort of unofficial pension plus no-compete agreement, which were abruptly rescinded by new owners when the company was sold.",

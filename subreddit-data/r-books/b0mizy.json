One of them compulsively bangs her head on the wall. \n\n\n\nNot only that, it absolutely destroys any quality of life for anyone close to them that needs to care for them regularly, and it's a large burden on the system as well.\n\n\n\nI would, far and away, prefer to have never been born in such a scenario.

Certainly if Amazon stopped carrying \"science fiction\" or \"black authors\" I don't think everyone would say \"they can carry what they want.\"    \n\nI think is is a good step that they stop selling \"anti-vaccine\" books (I'm an vehemently anti-anti-vaxx),  but it doesn't seem as straightforward to me as most people in this thread seem to think it is.",

Amazon could not legally get away with prohibiting \"black authors\", regardless of public opinion.\n\nGenerally speaking, the people making the \"carry what you want\" argument are not proposing or even defending the notion of Amazon engaging in illegal discriminatory practices that are already outlined in our laws as clear exceptions to the \"do/sell what you want\" rule.",

There are other places to get those books.\n\nAmazon has a growing list of restricted products, and some of them are down-right arbitrary. For third party sellers, fine Art is prohibited in most cases, as are laser pointers. Amateur porn is prohibited as well. Pretty much no one has been crying censorship over all these restrictions in the past, despite the fact that they've been curating products for a while now.",

A similar example would be if you asked a Muslim cartoonist to draw a picture of Mohammed and they refuse you service.

It's being denied because the person providing the service thinks it's immoral and is something they wouldn't do for any customer.",

One argument used in the Colorado Court of Appeals was that another case brought by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had bakers refuse to write anti-gay speech on cakes, and the bakers were not compelled to make a custom cake with that message. But both were required to make standard wedding cakes, they'd probably have to make cakes previously made for other customers, too.\n\nI feel like another part of the reason it's misunderstood is that it took years until the case was overturned by the supreme court in favor of the business. When that happened in June 2018, I barely heard about it.",

Other books full of bad science certainly exist, and many of them are for sale on Amazon. That fact does not constitute an endorsement by the company of their contents. It's possible that they could be removed in the future.\n4. Every argument against this I've read here is exactly the definition of a slippery slope fallacy, as /u/Corvidwarship rightly points out in another comment.\n\nBottom line, this story is a big fat nothingburger that's being blown out of proportion here by hand-wringing about nonexistent censorship using a logically unsound argument.\n\nEdit: Yeah, Amazon is a public company.

Misinformation about vaccines do not only harm the self but society as a whole. A big part of why we vaccinate is for herd immunity, to prevent outbreaks and prevent those who are most susceptible to those diseases and who can die from them, including those who may not be able to be vaccinated. The antivaxxer movement has led to actual, tangible, *preventable* outbreaks and even death. This is starting to become a widespread problem and the idiots who are participating in this movement are not only hurting themselves but everyone around them as well. So I don't think this is that difficult a line to draw, and while I personally would be totally okay with removing the dumb diabetus cure book as well, that's some pretty outlandish whataboutism and a completely different situation.",

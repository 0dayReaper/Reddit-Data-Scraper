Near the end of page 87 the gardener states to Francoise, \u201c\u2026 when your revolution\u2019s declared the only ones what gets called up is them as wants to.\u201d\n\nNot sure if this was an interesting dialogue choice by Proust or a weird translation by Grieve but it gave me a stroke reading it. Will this turn me away from Grieve\u2019s translation or am I misunderstanding the point of the diction?",

One time she and a bunch of grad friends had a competition; summarize Proust\u2019s \u2018Remembrance of Things Past\u2019 in 10 words or less. Difficult until they came to the anthropology student, who said \u2018A man falls in love with a cookie.\u2019 Accurate.\n\nAnyway, this is working class speech. You can find it in a lot of novels from the time as the typical speech of farmers, laborers, or the uneducated. He\u2019s basically trying to say no one who doesn\u2019t want to fight is going to go",

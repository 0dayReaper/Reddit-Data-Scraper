    "postText": "I was raised Evangelical. I am 21 years old. Some months ago, I started having doubts and questions about Bible, religion, church and God. I was depressed, because I couldn't believe anymore, but at the same time I was afraid of going to Hell (I know it sounds contradictory), and also of hurting my parents and relatives. Then I came across these two books. Oh, boy! They literally saved me! They made me understand that the imposition of fear is the very reason why one should reject religion in the first place. I feel much better now being a nonbeliever, and I even can justify with solid arguments my reasons for no longer believing.\n\nAnyone here struggling with their belief in God, in any way feeling oppressed by religion? If you are a nonbeliever, was it easy for you to leave the church?",

Like bad karma when being re-incarnated.\n\nI believe people should do good and be good because it's just the right thing to do and how things should be. Not because religion is telling someone to follow certain rules or else. \n\nBelieving in a god or gods is fine so long as you're not, for lack of a better word, intimidating people into following a religion. People should believe in things because it brings them peace and makes them feel hopeful or better. Not because they're scared of the \"repercussion\" if they stray.",

People have been saying that about the next generation since Plato.  Cultures change over time, my man.\n\nSecond, religion is just a specialized cultural system.  It's not about morality, it's a framework for experiencing reality, like any other cultural system.  It doesn't lay a foundation for morality, it codifies what we already know as humans.\n\nYou think the Jews didn't know \"do not kill\" until it was written in their Bible?\n\nNope.  We all know what is moral, all human groups have codes of morality that are broadly similar and based on the argument from analogy: I'm human, you're human, I should treat you the way I want to be treated.\n\nThird, u/lynn_mai is absolutely correct in that some religious teachings is about scaring people - hence, preachers go on and on about hell and punishment.  That's one of the main issues OP discusses in their post, about how they were worried about being punished within the context of their religious beliefs because of giving up said beliefs.\n\nOP: yes, I wasted years of my life on religion, too.  And was super happy to get out of it and read non-mythological arguments and evidence about the nature of reality and humankind.  Definitely understand how you feel!\n\nGlad those books helped you and thank you for sharing them.",

Not that I've never felt transcental moments in my life, but even those moments don't feel spiritual, or not in a way that anyone's ever described spirituality to me.\n\nAs for where we go from here, to me that is a broad question that could mean a lot of different things. Are you asking how do we navigate morals and ethics as we interact with others? Or is there something fundamental to life and well being you feel that can only be got from spirituality? The first is a continuous reasoning with ourselves and others from our experiences and society while the second is a much more in depth discussion I suppose on a lot of topics. Like a lot a lot.\n\nAt the end of the day, if spirituality gives you meaning, or purpose, or well any positive outcomes, then I'm happy for you and you keep doing you. Our lives are all our own, and each has its highs and lows, so all the power to what keeps you fulfilled and happy",

Sometimes it may be a matter of going past whatever anyone else is saying and seeing what goes on in your own experience. \n\nFor me sitting in the choir loft during mass at age 5 had an impact, primarily because of the music I suspect but also because of the pageantry. But we all have unique sensibilities: I know that I was born with a gene for music--I was up there because my mom was in the choir. This is why I have to ask the question: because we all come into the world with different brains encountering different circumstances.\n\nNavigating morals and ethics is also part of the question of course. But morals and ethics still have to be \"inspired\" in some positive way or else we'll just walk away, if not in behavior then in conviction.",

I think the examples you gave have tie-ins to spirituality, you see it in religions. Just consider the art and music you find in any religion as an example. Certainly nature is another when you think about Eastern religions and Native American spiritual practices.\n\nFor many people meditation practices provide a spiritual experience. There are ways of viewing the world, even in common with different religions, which you can find represented in guided mediations that don't rely on supernatural beliefs but give meaning to existence. At times language is used that invokes supernatural, but can be taken as symbolism. I've even heard some explanations given of teachings in religious texts that make way more sense than what I ever heard explained in church. Teachings are available to anyone whether they are a follower of the religion or not.\n\nI've long been an atheist now, but therapists have encouraged spirituality to help with my mental health. Spirituality is available to others without having to follow a particular religion, and I've found it easiest to find in mindfulness meditation.",

Then you're looking at the Bible as a set of writings that have their historical and cultural contexts over a couple thousand years. You're looking into the original language to the extent possible. Your looking at the Gospels in terms of their sources and timelines as early Christianity developed. (For example, see the Wikipedia article on the Gospel of Matthew.) And a lot more. One end result is The Jesus Seminar (again see Wikipedia) which resulted in some very accessible books (by Marcus Borg, for example.)\n\nOut of that comes the idea that maybe Jesus had something useful to say: that's there's a core message, a positive one, that's managed to sustain itself through the ages in spite of the best efforts of religious institutions to corrupt it.",

We owe our existence to a God - one who describes creation in book 1, page 1 of the Old Testament and gets the nature of the universe wrong.  \n\n\nWe need Jesus to redeem us from a sin that our ultimate forebears made.  One that an all-knowing God let happen, an all Powerful God had to react by damning most of the human race, and an All Loving God refused to simply forgive, and instead blamed the entirety of humanity for something that occurred before we were born.\n\nIt's a pretty silly thesis.  \n\n\nJesus as a philosopher has some good things to say.  But ultimately none of it is new.   He wouldn't be a particularly well known figure if it weren't for the religion - and all the harm it caused.",

In this case, how were cultural outlooks on life influenced by original sin, which is really a lot more complicated and just raises more questions: yep, every person born has the capacity for evil and we all do it sometimes but, wait! this came about because someone wanted knowledge?! ... Is this really wrong?\n\nAnd then there's the metaphor of a ***word*** resulting in creation.  \n\nFor me, the questions being asked are much more intriguing than whether the answers are \"wrong\" or not. And keep in mind that the questions never really get answered if you look at the sources rather than the centuries of interpretation: all you get is a story.",

While not new, that is always a powerful message.  Bu the OT and NT versions of God clearly don't have anything to do with each other.  That's the modernization it used to recruit.  \n\n\nTake circumcision, literally the Jews' covenant with God (as ridiculous as that is).   It was politically difficult to convert non-Jews because no adults males wanted their penises cut on.   Paul pleaded before the early Church elders that they needed to get rid of that premise.   Politics was involved from the start, because that's when they decided that the Old Law was null and void, despite Christ saying the exact opposite.   They wanted to recruit.   We don't have modern Christianity without that political decision.  \n\n\nAdd in Paul writing quite a bit that served Roman interests in the New Testament, and he wrote 2/3rds of it according to most scholars.   We got 1500 years of the divine right of Kings from Paul.   Religion and the monarchy intertwined.   Hell, even Jesus said render unto Caesar his due - a particularly impactful statement considering that his people were subjugated by Rome at the time.   Pay your taxes even if the government oppresses you.   Of course, the most probable interpretation of that is Jesus didn't want to die, as a mortal man.  And he knew that question was designed to give the authorities the right to imprison him.    \n\n\nAs to the rest, IMO there's a lot that's clearly morally or objectively right or wrong.  Yes, it's immoral to suggest that evil is caused by knowledge.  Evil exists just fine in ignorance, hell it relishes it.   Original sin isn't complicated at all.   It was obedience.   Do what God tells you to - and the Priests tell you what God wants.   If there isn't a God...  \n\n\nI don't find these questions intriguing.  I find it wearisome that people still haven't seen through this.  \n\n\nHell, my first exposure to it was when I dropped in on a Benedictine Monk BBS and the Monks were arguing over why Paul disputed Jesus on so many instances.",

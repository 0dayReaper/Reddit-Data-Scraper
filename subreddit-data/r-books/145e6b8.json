    "postText": "I wanted to read this book for a long time and finally did last week, and was unfortunately bored to bits by it. \n\nOf course I did not expect a fast-paced thriller, l expected it to be a slow and intoxicating read where the monotonousness of every day and the beauty of nature combine to give a dreamy and nostalgic feeling. More so as it was critiqued as being an \"addictive dystopia\". \n\nBut what I did end up reading felt like (sorry in advance) someone badly documenting their minecraft survival world. The day to day life which consisted of animals and farming was cumbersome to read through. \nThe pacing was so bad the author herself unnecessarily included future events in the middle (how the bull died, the disappearance of the cat, the dog's death....) to most likely encourage you to continue reading.\n\nThe only good part was the main character's development, of slowly getting rid of the chains of society which held her back in her old life. But this in itself wasn't enough to redeem the entire book as some people think, it was still boring for most part. So as a whole, the book wasn't enjoyable.\n\nSo what are your thoughts on it? \n\n(As I suspect) Did I expect it to be something it just wasn't in the first place? \n\nShare your honest opinions :)",

            "comment": "I absolutely loved it when I first read it, but it was also one of the first full novels I read in German, so that might cloud my judgement. In fact, I'm afraid to read it again for this reason. \n\nI don't remember minding the pacing at all and I  finished it relatively quickly. I fould myself emotionally invested in even the smallest things, partly due to the higher stakes of the story, partly due to the writing. I'm not normally an animal lover, but think the animals where characterized like people and I found myself caring about them all.\n\nI think the ending with the dog worked well here. She did a similarly  shocking ending in a different novel and it made her seem like a one trick pony. I think the ending worked much better here.",

    "postText": "I've recently finished *Wave Without a Shore* by CJ Cherryh, and I was struck with just how relevant it still felt, despite being 35 years old. Dystopias always aim to hold a mirror to the world they were written in, which makes older dystopias very interesting, particularly those that get less attention now.\n\n*Waves Without a Shore* is a dystopia of totally individualist libertarians, who are so concerned with not letting others affect their actions, they spend their whole time denying everyone else's realities. \n\n&gt;Master: What is more real, my reality or yours?  \nProtagonist: Mine  \nMaster: How do you demonstrate that?  \nProtagonist: I need not\n\nIn the weirdest way, quotes in this old sci-fi book felt like they came straight out of internet gigachad memes:\n\n&gt;\"Make love?\" she murmured politely. \"No need\" he said.\n\nRefusing to elaborate is seen as one of the strongest forms of argument. There are multiple scenes of the protagonist doing that then leaving.\n\n&gt;Protagonist: Am I within your reality?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Apprentice: (Silence)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Protagonist: That is the correct answer.\n\nBut the interesting part of the book was normally I'd expect a book on this topic to focus on the damage these people did to others. Instead it focused on the damage these attitudes have on those who hold them. They're deeply lonely people and they're constantly rejecting chances at relationships with others out of fear that they'll be manipulated. The protagonist tells himself that loneliness is the cost of being superior, and others stay away from him because he thinks more clearly than them.\n\nAs the book goes on, you begin to empathise for these people, as bad as they are. The whole idea of 'alternate realities' - a term that comes up in modern political discourse a lot - causes harm because it denies people recognition, and recognition is shown as one of the basic human wants.",

            "comment": "I don't know whether one would call Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon a dystopian book. There are periods when the world is in a very bad place, and brief moments of glorious utopias. History cycles and cycles, and until humanity is wiped out, the peaks get higher and the troughs get lower. The narrator is sorrowful about all the atrocities and horrors, and hopeful about the golden ages, yet there's a distance to a realizing that everything that happens to people is an infinitesimal part of far grander historical forces. If there are lessons I can find, it's that understanding and accommodation between radically different cultures is the only thing preventing mutual destruction, and that there is a little comfort in appreciating the happiness and beauty of the lives of people from the past, even as times get bad.",

This book is set in the US after the world has lost at least 2/3s of its population due to a fast-moving plague. At first it's every man for himself, but eventually we see people trying to band together, gain power, and develop the structure of a republic. I'm only about half way through, so I have no idea how it will end. I'm not a huge fan of dystopian fiction, but this book has me fascinated. I can't wait to see how it turns out.",

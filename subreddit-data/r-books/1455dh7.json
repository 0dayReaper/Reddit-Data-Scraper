AFAIK, besides organizing and putting the weight of her public image behind it, Parton's foundation also determines which books to buy, combines the money to buy in bulk, and distributes them to the local volunteer offices.   \n\nIt's a really great thing, and a wonder use of fame.",

I'll go further and say as a child I thought it was amazing that people sent my parents stuff in the mail and I longed to get something (as an adult I realize it was mostly bills). Finally, I don't think you understand what is like when you are poor to own something as simple as a book.",

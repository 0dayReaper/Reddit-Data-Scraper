    "postText": "I'd like to know what's the best book you've ever read and what's your favorite one. I'm curious to know whether it's the same, because I feel like there's can be a difference between a book you consider is better written and a book that might not be the best written you've ever read but has given you more emotions than every other book.\nFor me the best book I've read is 1984 while my favorite is actually A little life. I consider 1984 a masterpiece which gave me chills, but A little life made me really emotional and shattered my soul.",

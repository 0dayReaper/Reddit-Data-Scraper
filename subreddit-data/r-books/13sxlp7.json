    "postText": "I finished Flowers for Algernon today. \n\nAs Charlie\u2019s writing became more childish, full of grammar and punctuation mistakes, I began to cry. I\u2019m a man who hasn\u2019t cried in who knows how long, but Charlie visiting Alice again, making her cry and thinking he pulled a Charlie Gordon broke me. When he first dropped an apostrophe, I started to die inside.\n\nIn my head canon, the experiments move at a fantastic rate and Charlie becomes intelligent again soon after. The only idea that make it easier to bare the tragedy.",

There\u2019s no cure for it.\nAnd as such that there is a cure for it in future and I hope there is - the cure shouldn\u2019t stem from rearranging dna sequences and modifying such genetics. There\u2019s also prevention and also if you know that there\u2019s a high chance - people should consider the need to procreate vs adopting.\nAlso, Charlie also suffers from PKU - something the USA screens newborns for now.\nI\u2019m not playing god here at all.\nI\u2019m making an educated guess and not choosing to decide how a certain individual lives his life.\nHe wasn\u2019t aware of his conditions as very much indicated in the book. His awareness stems from his increasing knowledge.\nI truly believe that people should get cured of their disorders and diseases and genetic sequencing and imaging plays a huge role in that. But truly what my main concern is, that when we do that we\u2019re \u201cmeddling\u201d with nature and as humans, our greeds know no boundaries. We will engage in more and more genetic modification until we make \u201cperfect babies\u201d.

It's contradictory to say you wish for a cure without utilizing the only possible means for cure. \n\nYou aren't just observing or making an educated guess, you are choosing for these people to be ignorant, in this hypothetical. You would choose to not allow them to have the capacity to have knowledge because you don't believe in genetic alteration.\n\nYou seem to have taken the novel as something more than fiction. The opinions expressed in it are worth exploring, but they are just the opinions of an author who does not have any real answers. The character, Charlie, only suffered because the author wrote him as such.\n\nAnd what is evolution if not animals being directed by nature towards perfection? So what is unnatural about our human pursuit of it? Why would you describe that as greed?",

Your perception of the natural world and its tolerance/intolerance for the 'unnatural' should not influence the progression of science and medicine. Likewise, you shouldn't use the prospect of that-which-is natural or unnatural to defend some sense of morality or ethics. There are behaviors in nature that we have naturally evolved past the need to commit and now deem immoral. Nature isn't an objective determinant of morality.\n\n-Adios",

A lot of people from non-English speaking countries (mine included) have never even heard of this book at all and most of us haven't been forced to read US/UK classics in school because we have our own classics. So all of these books are 'new' to us. I read it last year and all I knew about it is that it kept making people cry, because of all the topics about it on reddit. And if they are from a country where this book is well known, not everyone grows up under the same circumstances and have had the opportunity to read it or know about it. It takes almost zero effort to use a spoiler tag and not ruin a book experience for others. So refusing to do the bare minimum, so other can enjoy the book without spoilers is a bit......",

Sometimes you can't help but pick up things when you scroll by (it's happened to me several times as well) and right at the start of this post is pretty much the entire point of the book. I'm not saying that everyone who comments needs to use spoiler tags in a spoiler post. I'm just saying that the entire post should be marked as a spoiler discussion. A simple spoiler tag on the entire post hides the text and it let's people know that there are spoilers. If it takes pretty much zero effort (one click/tap while making the post) and it allows others to avoid spoilers when desired, is it even worth arguing over? I'll never understand why some always seem so excited to ruin things for others just because they've known about it for years.",

However, we are on an English subreddit about books where there is a discussion about an English book/short story that is 60+ years old. Yes, people should be tolerant of others and aware of differences,  I just feel that having a go about someone not tagging something so well known in literature circles with spoiler alert when it's so old and on this forum and when the title of the thread isnt spoiling anything, is like asking for spoiler alerts on the titanic movie on a Kate Winslet fan page.",

BUT\n\nThe themes are about humanity in many relatable and universal ways; and it's style is emotional because what is being experienced is emotional.  It's change into a more logical intelligence simply adds weight to the emotion of memory.  \n\nAnd Charlie's regression is what most people, of my own age, fear.  To lose what we have gained, over decades, in memory and capabilities.  \"Getting old\".  Dementia;  going from a productive, smart, active member of society, to someone who needs care, again, as if we are children.\n\nIt hits stereotypes, shamelessly, but stereotypes of the human condition are stereotypes for a reason ... they are honest and common.  But our society has seen them so much, that we grow a little less sensitive to them.  We want more subtly but that's not what the book is about.\n\nI loved this book. It tugged at my guts in a way that few ever do. And it still does, almost 50 years later.",

I also remember reading a story when I was young called \"Black Like Me' by John Howard Griffin. It is a true story that amazed and saddened me greatly. Then of course there was \"Day of The Dolphin\" by Robert Merle that was also made into a movie with George C. Scott. It made me cry for sure when dealing with the ultimate interactions between the humans and the dolphins.  And then of course a story that along with the others mentioned, will always be forefront in my mental library - \"The Old Man and the Sea' by Ernest Hemingway. I actually saw the movie with Spencer Tracey before I read the book. OMG I cried my eyes out. I will just say that it is so engrossing and the ending killed me.\n\nSo yeah, those are the stories that have a permanent penthouse in my mind. :)\\~",

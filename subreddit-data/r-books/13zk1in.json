    "postText": "They have this new (? Maybe just new to me lol) thing where the kindle books automatically integrate/come with the audible readings and they sync up so you can move from reading to listening and back - both free for all the books in their Amazon classics series. Flipping back and forth has been working seamlessly for me - def recommend! You don\u2019t even need a kindle I just use my iPhone",

I hate their Kindle app on the pc. i mostly read either on calibre or on moonreader and with the new update, i can't get my ebooks to my favourite app. I've switched back to physical copies but it's pretty difficult to carry a copy of the bigger books around.\n\nIf hell is real, i hope there a special place there for people who make and use DRM.",

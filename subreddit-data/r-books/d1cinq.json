In an essay on a Stephen King fan site,\u00a0[Brown explains](http://www.liljas-library.com/bachman_exposed.php/):\n\n&gt;&gt;When I read an advance copy of\u00a0Thinner, I was no more than two pages into it when I said, \"This is either Stephen King or the world's best imitator.\" I began to ponder that maybe this *was* King. More or less as a kind of game, not real seriously, I took the subway over to the Library of Congress to look up the copyright documents. All but the oldest were copyrighted in Kirby McCauley's name\u2014a big clue, as KM was King's agent, but not conclusive. McCauley had many clients. I almost gave up at this point, as the oldest book was copyrighted before the LC changed to an easy computer system. But, just to be anal about it, I insisted the clerk go off and manually hunt up the document. She came back and handed it to me. There it was: Stephen King, Bangor, Maine. I xeroxed all documents and went home.",

The new IT was pretty good horror. Some of the older movies are a bit corny now, but they're still pretty good films. I think it just requires the right people to helm the projects, who have knowledge about the source material and why it worked, same as with adapting any other books to films.",

This one regarding his prolificness stands out:\n\n&gt;Some writers take years; James Patterson takes a weekend. Every writer is different. I feel that a first draft should take about four months, but that\u2019s me. And I go over my work obsessively. Here\u2019s another thing \u2013 creative life is absurdly short. I want to cram in as much as I can.\n\nAlso, this one about his writing speed:\n\n&gt;Have you ever forced yourself to go slower?\n\n&gt;Deliberately go slower? No, never. I\u2019ve written longhand [Dreamcatcher], but poke along and obsessively polish? No. You keep picking a scab, you\u2019re gonna make it bleed instead of heal.\n\nAnd finally, about getting into the zone while writing:\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t think writing is a mental illness, but when I\u2019m working and it\u2019s going really well, time and the real world kind of disappear.\n\nHis book On Writing is great advice as well, full of motivational quotes like this regarding getting your work done.",

If GRRM tried to write at that pace, I have a feeling he\u2019d be cranking out dogshit.\n\nFor some people, writing well simply takes a while. Not to mention the fact that GRRM is trying to trim down the scope of this monster he\u2019s created to fit into two 500,000 word novels rather than split his next one into two novels as he did with the original Dance of Dragons. He has POV characters he has to either kill off or join with other POV characters to limit the POV chapters, figure out a concise and believable way to get Dany to Westeros without giving her too much narrative time (not to mention the delicate way he needs to set up and foreshadow her descent into madness\u2014which is something we all know the show runners botched pretty badly).\n\nIt sucks that George is getting older and the series may very well not get finished, but I\u2019d personally rather have an unfinished masterpiece than something that started out great but ended up rushed and disappointing.

Despite its flaws, it's probably the one that the majority of people would say is his best work, or certainly in his top five.  The book as a whole is okay, but when looked at as a series of vignettes around a theme, it's wonderful.\n\n\nMisery is absolutely in the top five, if not the best book he's ever written.  It's concise.  It's quick.  It's BRUTAL.  It's legit scary.  It's got probably his best villain.  Misery is amazing.\n\n\nNow, Lisey's Story.  I feel like no one knows about Lisey's Story, because I legit think Lisey's Story belongs in his top 2-3 (alongside Misery and... well... something...), but most people I talk to, even King fans seem to have never read it.  In fact, I can't recall ever talking to another person who's read Lisey's Story.  It seems to be very overlooked, and I find it interesting that apparently King also thinks it's one of his best.",

It could not stay. It had been banished. It knew how to come back, I was sure of that, but it could not stay and I could really go to sleep. My heart cracked with gratitude. I think it was the first gratitude I\u2019ve ever really known. I lay there beside you and the tears rolled down the sides of my face and onto the pillow. I loved you then and I love you now and I have loved you every second in between. I don\u2019t care if you understand me. Understanding is vastly overrated, but nobody ever gets enough safety. I\u2019ve never forgotten how safe I felt with that thing gone out of the darkness.",

I was mixed about it at first but when I reread it a second time it all gelled for me, especially after reading an interview where he explained that the book came to him when he saw everything in his office boxed up due to a remodel of his studio after his accident.\n\nIt really nails grief very well, and Lisey's memories of her life with Scott were both weird, intimate, and loving. Definitely in the top 3, and now I'm gonna go read it again. It's been awhile.",

Is it trying to say that he writes like everyone else? He doesn't, his various styles aren't even copied much. I suspect mostly due to pacing, as his styles are often slow, which isn't something most dime-a-dozen authors would go for.\n\nIs it trying to say his books are largely the same? While he has his share of similarly paced and styled books, I actually can't think of many authors who has varied their storytelling form more. Among popular writers I can't actually think of a single one who has varied their style more, maybe Ray Bradbury comes close.\n\nI think people who call him the \"Nickelback of literature\" either have read very little literature and are talking ignorantly, or they have no experience with King's bibliography and are talking prejudicially.",

My 6 year old is in kindergarten and is reading at a 2nd grade level. \n\nThis is NOT A NORMAL SITUATION FOR ANYBODY. It is not normal to be essentially locked in your own home. Every children's activity that I normally would take them to is closed. My daughter adores kindergarten and is heartbroken that she can't go. I am 100% willing to do all the susy homemaker activities. But you know what? Kids don't work that way. They fight, they whine, they fuss. They pick up on your stress and anxiety (which is extremely high in this totally unprecedented situation) and throw fits over the dumbest things. You can't be \"on\" for 13 hours a day. Normally some of that time is eaten up by driving to and from school and activities. \n\nIf this kind of video actually worked on my kids (it doesn't, the 1 and 3 year old try to destroy the house if I put on too much TV because they can't sit more than 30min a day), I would be using it. As it stands I'm doing my best to get them exercise and keep them from killing each other. This morning my daughter had some school time and wrote a story, we baked Irish soda bread for st Patrick's day, we went on a nature hike, and we played board games and that was all by 1pm. And they still had plenty of time to watch 30 min of educational TV in the middle.",

I think it was originally uploaded by MyDamnChannel even though it looks like it\u2019s been re-uploaded on another channel with the series name. Anyway, it was one of the funniest things on YouTube at the time in my opinion. It\u2019s brilliantly hilarious and I\u2019d recommend it. They are just an average of five minute sketches in a small series and worth checking out. Seems it never went viral though it should have been. That was the first time I had ever seen Josh Gad in anything, but have been a fan ever since. Check it out if you want to seriously laugh.",

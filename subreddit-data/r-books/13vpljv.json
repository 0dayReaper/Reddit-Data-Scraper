Has anyone read this and can tell me wtf did I just read?\n\nIt was awful, but also like a train wreck that I couldn't look away and put it down? I truly don't know what genre this is, like a fantasy smut distopian adventure book? I mean MFC scales mount everest in a wedding dress ffs to find an ancient sex guru to learn the tantric ways of self fulfilment to save the female population from nanobots that enter their blood stream through newly invented sex toys, lmao! \n\nIt was a very interesting experiement that I will try again, but as a first book to pick this way, my head is still spinning! \n\nAnyone else read this and can have a discussion on wtf I just read\ud83e\udd23",

            "comment": "Oh wow, nice introduction. \n\nChuck writes what can be defined as transgressive fiction.\n\nHis most famous work is Fight Club, but a lot if his books focus on damaged people in situations outside the bounds of what is considered socially acceptable, at best, or purile grossness, at worst.\n\nOften satirical, his works can be heavy handed and his hit rate is uneven.\n\nGenerally speaking, his best books are his earliest (this is not one of them) and decline in quality as you go along. However, his last couple have seen somewhat \"return to form\", with The Adjustment Bureau (which I actually thought was pretty poor) and The Invention of Sound (which didn't quite hit the mark but was closer than most).\n\nIf you enjoyed it (or were sufficiently intrigued) by Beautiful You, I'd recommend trying some of his earlier stuff, but also reading a synopsis before you dive in!",

He's so good at making you see or feel moments in his book. I bet he could write a fantastic horror novel if he decided to change things up. \n\nRant is my personal favorite and I feel like everything written after has been a miss. I'd have no issue with recommending everything written prior to and including Rant.",

He writes \"transgressive\" fiction but this one honestly feels like he totally phoned it in and was allowed to get away with it because of his body of work. \n\nBeautiful You is definitely his most \"not like other girls\" work of fiction - he intended it to be an examination of our relationship with pleasure as a society and it ends up being more of a  commentary on the smutty stuff that has always been really popular among women, books like \"Clan of the Cave Bear\" \"50 Shades of Grey\" hell, even \"Twilight.\" \n\nI have yet to revisit this one from his collection and am not sure if I will - I much prefer some of his earlier stuff like Invisible Monsters, Survivor, and Haunted, which all have their moments but don't seem like 200+ pages of \"lol, isn't this stuff like by primarily women so dumb?!\"",

If you ever want to give him another chance, Survivor and Invisible Monsters are amazing and I still think about them to this day. They get insane, but still very good.",

I generally like weird stuff, but that one was a bit of a noodle scratcher for me.\n\nIf you want a real brain twister by Chuck Palahniuk, check out Survivor.  Its about a guy who grew up in a cult and then survived a mass suicide event forcing him to go live in normal society.  Due to a newspaper misprint his phone number is listed as the number for a suicide prevention hotline and it leads to some very interesting events that I won't write here for spoiler purposes.  If you like dark dystopian humor its worth checking out.  Also I'm sure I'm going to get some very strange targeted ads after trying to Google the plot of that book because I couldn't remember the name.",

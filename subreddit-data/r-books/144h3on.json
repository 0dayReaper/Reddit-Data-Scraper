Anyways, I read one of those trash news pieces today with the slide show and it was all about how people's childhoods were ruined because they read Of Mice and Men. One of them did claim that their 5th grade school teacher read Steven King to them, which as someone who attended American schools, I can't help but think they are probably lying. But if that is true, I would agree that it was inappropriate. Still, the other ones were pretty ridiculous along the lines of kids should have no idea what is going on the world.",

Like kids being constantly watched until they are of high school age. This might be a slight exaggeration. But I do think there is a major difference between self reliance in European kids and American children. I rode my bike to school 10+ kilometres away every day (yes, I\u2019m Dutch) since I was 12. Nowadays my nephew does the same thing. I was allowed to go to school alone starting age 6. This school was half a kilometer from my home. I\u2019ve heard stories from the States where CPS got called because kids were playing alone in their own backyards or walking to the park by themselves. That is just wild to me. Especially because the USA is also the country that massively kicks out their kids after they turn 18. At least teach them how to take care of themselves first?!\n\nThis helicopter parenting extends to reading I guess. Kids are very good a deciding if they are ready to read certain materials or not. Just like adults some kids like to read sad books while others prefer scary or happy books. Off course all within the reasonable. I don\u2019t mean that you should give a 10 year old Fifty Shades of Grey for Christmas.",

I mentioned a kid reading Stephen King to my mum the other day and she literally tutted. We don't really have the amount of relativity about what kids and adults read either, perhaps because our classic literature is still valued as part of our culture, though not as highly so as French lit is valued in France (education system seems a lot better in other European cultures too).",

Junot D\u00edaz and Barbara Kingsolver are also taught at the local community college as part of the general Ed. How are the children from other states going to compete for jobs in the future if we hide \"tough\" subjects from them and pretend history never happened?",

Obviously not everyone will do it right but a good educator will give you the tools to read difficult works, whether you go on to keep reading things like Shakespeare or use those skills other ways, like to communicate with people who write differently than you or to read complicated texts for work or to practice a new language. \n\nI don\u2019t think English classes are *just* about the love of reading what you already like\u2014understanding what\u2019s said and the meaning behind it is important for communication and reading is part of that. It doesn\u2019t always have to be just fun.",

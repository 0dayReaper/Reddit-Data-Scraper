That was by far my favourite. I\u2019ve read it about a million times and my copy is BATTERED. I just wanted to know also if there are other people who just do still like his books and take some of his writing with them into adulthood.\n\nFor a grown man, he\u2019s good at writing like precocious teenagers. And his books have always stayed with me.",

So maybe I'm in the majority there, if you're right.\n\nI've never thought he actually captured the way children think and talk, and it feels more like he just takes his own voice/personality, and then makes characters act stupidly while they chatter/banter the whole book.\n\nI also think it may just be a difference between us in upbringing. Funnily enough, he and I grew up partially in similar places, but I think he comes from a slightly more affluent family than I do, so his suburban teen stuff feels off to my more poor rural memories of childhood. \n\nI think he seems like a cool person though, and I like seeing some of his videos.",

His teen characters imo are not necessarily supposed to be accurate representations of how teens act and talk, but more accurate representations of how teens see themselves. Like we all think we're so deep as teens and every feeling is so big and we're melodramatic. In general, they are huge themes in his books (how people perceive themselves and others and how we romanticize people), so I feel like this makes sense, while they still act silly or stupid in ways that regular teenagers do. I was a teenager at the height of his popularity, so I'm sure that clouds my judgement immensely (!) but at the time, I always thought it was so great how he wrote teenagers that think and talk like that - because unlike a lot of other YA fiction, his books didn't assume that teens couldn't think and talk like that if that makes sense. That's just my perspective though obviously!",

It's more of a happy accident. \n\nI think he has difficulty writing outside his current self.\n\nOf course, I am 100% no John Green expert, and he's still an excellent writer overall, this is just sort of my hot-take-critique of him.

I don't have a specific video to point you to, but I feel like that's the kind of sentiment he has expressed countless times over the years.",

I haven\u2019t read one in awhile as I am definitely now outside the target audience, but when I was reading them they were just very readable escapism. \n\nHowever, I do really love listening to him talk about other peoples books. He comes off as very intelligent and passionate about literature.

Anthropocene was very human and empathetic and I think John Green is really good at sitting in his feelings when he writes while staying coherent. The five star rating thing felt a little tacked on. I'm excited to read his fiction but I'm afraid I should have just jumped right to Fault in our Stars instead of Looking for Alaska but I think I'll enjoy it.\n\nI do have to say though, I read \"The Bell Jar\" by Sylvia Plath immediately after finishing The Anthropocene Review and it blew John Green's writing out of the water. I don't think I could have read Bell Jar and then Anthropocene Review, and then stayed interested in his writing. A little bit of an apples and oranges comparison between those two books but its' significant to how I look back at it.\n\nRegardless, looking forward to Looking for Alaska!",

Fault in Our Stars gets all the attention but it's the most predictable book. I mean, it's all YA so predictability is not a surprise. But one needs to enjoy the journey. With Fault in Our Stars I found myself kind of bored. And then a bit annoyed that he picked such a great title from such a great Murrow speech and didn't do more for it. Because I think overall John Green is fantastic. He has a keen sense of what makes humans human. And his writing is powerful because he can evoke the awkward trepidations of young humans trying to sort out what it means to be human and to be humans in relation to others.",

            "comment": "I feel like this isn't an unpopular opinion? Although I kind of see what you're saying, there definitely are certain groups of people who dismiss his writing for various reasons - some of which I would vehemently disagree with! But generally, I feel like most people think the same, at the very least in the \"he was a huge part of my teen years\" way. \n\nBut yeah, the way he writes teenagers has definitely stuck with me! I know a lot of people dismiss them, saying they don't act like \"real\" teenagers, but as a teen, I definitely felt like he/his books were one of relatively few YA books that took teen me's (sometimes melodramatic, over the top) feelings seriously. Like yes, his characters don't necessarily act and talk the way most regular teens act and talk, but they act and talk the way that a lot of teens (including myself) totally thought we acted and talked like at the time, if that makes sense. I thought everything was so deep and was chasing aesthetics and romanticizing others and myself and looking back, I can obviously see where that was a bit... well removed from reality, but I can also look back fondly and acknowledge, that I wasn't being \"melodramatic\" or \"over the top\", because to me, at that point in time,  it actually *was* that deep. I actually did think I was totally like Alaska, reblogging Sylvia Plath quotes on my tumblr and whatnot. And I really think that is what has always shined through in his writing, he really allows teens to sit in these feelings and doesn't dismiss them as being too emotional or too dramatic or not smart enough to actually get it. And I think that's something that - looking back - not a lot of YA lit gets right imo. \n\nThis for sure is skewed by the fact that I was the exact target age group when I read his YA books (although at 18, I might've started to grow out of the genre when Turtles all the way down came out? but I still absolutely loved it) and then really needed to hear what The Anthropocene Reviewed had to say when that came out. And I've been a fan of him on the internet for a long time too, so I'm definitely not unbiased here.",

As I understand, they are consistent and legible to the intended audience across all his YA books. Does he even write \"adult\" lit?\n\nI think I saw a piece where he says writes his characters relative to his own child/teen experiences. Idealized (or not so idealized) from memory, depending on the sort of themes he's trying to communicate.\n\nI respect him as a fellow internet nerd, but I really can't say more as I am not terribly familiar with his book writing.",

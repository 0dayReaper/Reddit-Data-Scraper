    "postText": "How many typographical errors do you usually come across in printed books? \n\nTo the best of my recollection I don't usually find many at all, maybe one if unlucky, but I am reading a Simon and Schuster print of Fahrenheit 451 and am frankly disappointed there are two glaring editing mistakes - one being 'a' instead of 'as', and 'fight' instead of 'flight'. These are definitely errors given the context.\n\nThere's one more which I can let slide but still is printed differently in other editions - the word usually appears as 'unease' but in this version is printed as 'dis-ease'... like i said, I'll let that go because it could be forgiven as creative wordplay, the opposite of 'ease' being made by adding prefix 'dis-' whilst also conjuring up a feeling of being diseased.\n\nIn any case I'm surprised an established publisher has dropped the ball on such a classic text. I would've thought proofreading before final publishing is required for all texts.",

If a typo is deep in the book I just make a snarky comment to myself and move on, but if it's near the start that might honestly sway my view on the book a little bit. At the very least it'll make me stop and wonder if the book is as solid as I maybe initially thought.",

I do stop and question whether the choice of language is a skilful deliberate artform to paint a picture in my mind or is there another error and I must expend energy to accurately decipher it. It slows everything down and frankly there's no excuse for it. \n\nIf a student would be penalised for making such a mistake in a submission to an educational institution then it's unacceptable that errors go to print through multiple levels of editors in a commercial publisher setting.",

It's not the most annoying, I still manage to just keep reading.\n\nBut I came across one recently that was almost driving me nuts. It was in Stephen King's novel Cell (translated version). One character was clearly thinking about his son called Johnny but it kept appearing Jordan (which is the name of another character).",

I'm a copyeditor who reads a lot of independently published books in my spare time, mostly historical fantasy and m/m romance, so I see more errors than you get with traditional publishing.\n\nAs a tabletop RPG editor, I work in a niche, low-paying genre that is often rife with typos. This is partly why I chose RPGs as a specialty: I love tabletop games and the industry badly needs editors. Many indie game publishers choose to skip using editors to save on costs, and only large gaming publishers can afford full-time staff editors.",

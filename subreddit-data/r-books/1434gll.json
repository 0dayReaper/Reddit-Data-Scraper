I was looking up an old teacher that I had in high school and they mentioned this book in his obituary condolences. I am truly fascinated by it. It gives you the tools to be an active reader and guidance for the various types of literature you will encounter and how to tackle it.",

It was a new useful technique to judge whether or not technical manuals would actually cover what I'm looking for",

This one was the biannual Okanagan Family Faire, Aka \"Barter Fair\". Been going on for 50 years. There's a bookstore there. Found some good ones cheap.\n\nThere's also the Oregon Country Fair. They have a library in the trees that's pretty awesome. Sat down there once on Saturday night and some good L and pulled a random book off the shelf behind me. Turned out it was in Japanese. Guy sitting next to said \"I know Japanese, want me to read some of it to you?\" \n\nHippie festivals are weird like that.",

And I missed Barter Fair last year, because it's a long drive just shy of the Canadian border and I just couldn't make it work. But a rad place in a beautiful setting.\n\nOregon Country Fair is unlike anything else. The closest comparison would be Burning Man, though they are also drastically different. Same kind of \"everyone is a part of making it happen, not just buying a ticket and showing up\" ethos. The whole place is basically a fairy village built into the woods (it started as a renaissance faire in the 60s), but in the most low impact way possible. All structures are wood and not permanently attached to any trees or set into the ground. It's left to the weather all winter then rebuilt as needed from mostly recycled wood the next year. There is spontaneous music and art everywhere. Parades, multiple stages, hundreds of handmade art vendors, buskers, children selling flower crowns, giant puppets, a naked dancefloor/showers, and more dirt and veggie burritos than any hippie could ever ask for, lol.",

I gotta go help build our booth this weekend.\n\nOne thing about OCF is that it's only open to the \"public\" for three days from 11am-7pm. You have to work or otherwise do something (or be hooked up somehow) to be able to stay there overnight, and of course that's when the real fun is. Thousands work to put it on, so thousands stay there. But even if you aren't on the \"list\" so to speak, there are multiple properties around the Fair (Fair owns the land on which it happens) that host their own campgrounds/festivals, so everyone gets a chance to stay and party if they want, even if the didn't get \"in\" that year. Of course, some people get huffy about not being able to stay, and call it \"elitist\" or whatever, but hey, we don't want those people there until they figure out that it's not about being \"elite\", it's about being a *part* of it, not just another spun out party kid who bought a ticket. If you are a good person and actually want to be there, you can find a job to do there, be it helping out in a food booth, sorting recycling, helping clear brush before the Fair, washing silverware, joining a dance troupe, *something*.\n\nIf you Google image search it, you can see all the wild costumery and art and such and all the effort that people put into making it a place out of time and reality.",

    "postText": "Finished another Heinlein novel tonight, that being \"I Will Fear No Evil\", one of the works of his middle period which also includes \"Stranger in a Strange Land\".\n\nJohann Smith an immensely old and extremely talented billionaire has found himself craving a new life. But the new life that he chooses comes at a very great cost.\n\nSoon his brain would be transplanted into the body of a beautiful young woman. With this new body he must forge a new path forward as new and unexpected challenges that reshapes his own existence into one that is more complex.\n\nThis is probably one of Heinlein most interesting novels of his middle period. Surely the Heinlein wasn't the first to use the idea of brain transplanting nor was he the last as that's one of the common tropes of science fiction. But it is a weirdly entertaining novel and very funny in places.\n\nOne thing about this novel that I've noticed is that it is much more raw than \"Stranger in a Strange Land\". I decided to look it up as to why that was and found my answer. After completing the first draft of the novel Heinlein came down with a life threatening illness. It is believed that it was this first draft ended up being published as a finished work in 1970 while Heinlein himself remained ill for the next two years.",

The old business man who actually has a brain and interesting things to say, unlike women, gets his brain put into the hot voluptuous body of a young woman\u2026basically making him perfect? It\u2019s so great he doesn\u2019t have to worry about business anymore like a man and can just be carefree hottie. It\u2019s so easy being a lady, am I right? And then who do they decide to date? Their old-man best friend of course! It\u2019s not really *gay* at that point\u2026just the two smart man brains can finally be together in a romantic and sexual way because one has hot lady packaging. \n\n\nHave you read his short time travel story \u201c\u2014All you zombies\u2014\u201c? It deals with an intersex character too but in a more interesting way due to the time travel. Although it makes me wonder about the gender issues that Heinlein was personally exploring/struggling with\u2026or maybe he just fetishized certain things. I Will Fear No Evil certainly comes off as a weird fetish piece to me.",

One thing I have been thinking about is who called her after Nina was kicked out telling her to stay away from Andrew? It wasnt Nina- so was it the mother? Was it Ezna? Now that I type this out I think it COULD be ezna, but im confused. I know he wanted to warn her. While she was getting calls, which was right after Nina left, Nina was with Ezna and we didnt see him call her.\n\nAlso, why would Nina (we dont know who did it but I assume her) call the grocery store and say she was stealing if she wanted Millie to stay?",

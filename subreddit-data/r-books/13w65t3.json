    "postText": "First of all I needed to vent about this and I could have sworn there was more of a discussion area on Goodreads for each book, but I guess it's just reviews and replying to reviews now?\n\nBefore I get to spoilers I should mention I was reading the book off and on for the past couple of months and only finished it today so I wasn't put off by the pace of it and as I was reaching the end I actually felt the suspense because I was finally going to find out who did it and why. Would love to read other people's opinions and if anyone know if I missed some details in the book.\n\nNow for the spoilers:\n\n&gt;!Ok Rowena Drake being involved didn't surprise me, I suspected that her and her husband had something to do with Olga disappearing in order to benefit them with the will, then over half way through the book you only just find out that her husband died before their aunt even died. Throughout the book I started getting suspicious of others just because Poirot kept talking to a bunch of other people. At one point I was even hoping Olga wasn't dead and was exacting her revenge somehow lol. I guess I lost track of who I was thinking was the murderer seeing as I took breaks reading the book.\n\nAs for the ending though, wtf? I feel like it was rushed and the whole Michael thing was kind of weak. I know I suspected early on that there could be a body hidden in the garden at some point when they mentioned a fountain was grown over and that there had been a death in the quarry before it was a garden, but I still think the connection is weak. Also why did it suddenly turn out that Michael was Miranda's dad???? That came out of nowhere and there was no indication that Poirot had gotten information like that or looked into it, he had just mentioned the island purchase and looking into Olga's letters and if she made it home. It was just squeezed in there at the end for no reason!\n\nAnd if I may add another thing, ANOTHER THING, the two young guys that helped out with the party and did the fake future husband photos just randomly show up to stop Michael at the end??? It's never explained how they knew he did anything and how they knew where to find him. Why just why???? I also loved that everyone was like, \"it's some mentally ill person or some long haired hooligan\" the whole time and no one is like, murders have motives. I guess in a small town no one has an explanation for a child being murdered, but it did get annoying reading that all the time. I wonder if it's a product of it's time?\n\nI really enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express which I thought was brilliant but I'm really disappointed by this book. I read a review that mentioned maybe the reason the book is the way it is is because Agatha Christie was a writer and writers have deadlines. !&lt;",

            "comment": "For me it was more the feelings of it, like when Poirot visited the garden. An immaculately designed garden in an old quarry, very beautiful, but its creator was evil. So to me it's more the themes of good and evil and creation and the value that is placed on beauty. To create something beautiful meant to stir the souls of others and yet regard them as less than insects is an interesting idea to me. \n\nThat Michael did not even care that the girl was his daughter, to me meant that he was so cold inside he gave no sign of her murder bothering him, even though she played in his beautiful garden often.\n\nI believe that theme came from a mixture of her love for her homes and gardens and the beautiful artifacts of ancient times that she and her husband Max studied on digs, to understand their creators. In general she loved beautiful things, and it shows in her description of the garden.\n\nThis might not be what you were asking, but I love Agatha Christie and wanted to share.",

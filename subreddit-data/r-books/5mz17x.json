During her analysis of some of the questions, she specifically calls out answers based on her personal knowledge that a reader cannot possibly know. Ok, let's reword those questions so they ask about the impact of the poem on the reader and remove any references to the author/poet.\n\nReading poetry is a subjective experience, but is it unreasonable to ask students to analyze the literary devices used in a poem and their likely effects on readers?",

IBM -- as far as I can tell -- has engineers who are not directly involved with the project write the documentation.  What this means is that you get wonderfuly descriptive instructions like, \"Specify the required attributes,\" or \"Drag each dimension that you want to work with onto the canvas,\" with absolutely no instructions on how you should know what the required attributes might be, what a dimensions is, or even where you might find the canvas.  And even when you know what you're doing, it won't tell you how to change attributes to those that are missing, add dimensions that weren't there before, etc.  IBM documentation technically qualifies as documentation, but is so sparse on actual information that the only people who might find it informative wouldn't need to use it in the first place.\n",

He took one poem and began to talk about how it depicts the betrayal of a lover and the emptiness after having sex with someone who's not quite understanding you and how tired is someone dating just because they feel obligated to and is scared to break and so on. That was really interesting speech. The only issue with it was I've written that poem being about 16, never having sex, never kissing, never dating anyone before. The Candle in the poem was not a representation of a woman burning in the fire of her sins as that gentleman told. I have written that piece during a big blackout in our town, looking at the candle that was almost gone and guessing if it will last long enough for me to fall asleep before I get finally scared by the darkness. \n\n",

It's been my experience that bad teachers stick to the line you're describing, while good teachers are open to new and different interpretations so long as they're well-argued and supported with strong textual or historically contextual evidence. As a matter of fact, any good English teacher would be elated to hear a creative and novel interpretation of material that they've likely taught many, many times, provided that it's well-reasoned. As with most arguments over how good of a job school does at performing its core function - actually schooling it's students, in this case by enabling them to think critically and communicate ideas effectively - this really boils down to the quality of the teachers doing the teaching. The value of a good teacher cannot be overstated.",

Rarely is it the case that they go do \"real world\" problems, or pull what the SAT often does by having you solve for one thing, then plug it into some arbitrary expression to get the \"real\" answer.\n\nThe SAT, both old and new, is rife full of problems where you set up one thing, solve for it, then have to plug into something else, because... why not? The New SAT frankly makes this worse... because on top of making more word problems that apply to the \"real world,\" they go ahead and *still* do this random plug-in shenanigans that is totally unnecessary. If they just made it real-world problems, I'd be OK with that... give folks a reason to see that Math can be useful... But nope, torture kids with translations problems that aren't necessarily taught in classes, then add a layer of needless complexity beyond that... further reinforcing a distaste for Math.\n\nThe English section on both ACT and SAT always bother me... the timing on it is such that \"comprehension\" is more akin to reading the question, finding any semblance of the words in said question on the passage, then trying to match words from the passage onto words in the answer bank. For those aggressively high, near-perfect scores, you have no real time to thoroughly process a passage, feign to \"get\" the point, and answer all the same.\n\nACT Science can be kind of BS-y in this manner, as well... I keep finding it more the case that students should dive into the questions immediately, place their fingers over the relevant figures/tables/etc while reading the problem initially, then trying to find what they're asking about. I've stopped recommending they give the passage a quick overview, as very few ever get the test done in time this way. Answer choices on this test are rather obnoxious too...\n\n\n* A) Yes, because the relationship is X decreases as Y decreases\n* B) Yes, because the relationship is X increases as Y decreases\n* C) No, because the relationship is X decreases as Y decreases\n* D) No, because the relationship is X increases as Y decreases\n\nMany times answer choices have responses that look almost entirely identical, save for one or two word changes between responses. Miss that ONE little word... and bam, it's wrong. Considering you've less than a minute per question on the Science, it's rather irritating.",

I've taught standardized test prep for one of the major companies since 2001. Historically the ACT had a higher lvl of math but would ask you things like 'solve for x'. The SAT on the other hand required less math ability but that same math problem would be a word problem asking you to 'figure out how old Sarah is compared to Ben'. They both ultimately ask the same thing but the later also requires a level of critical reasoning. \n\n\nAs to the posts about reading on the ACT, the first mistake people make is reading the passages. There's such a small portion of material that's relevant that it's easier to find the answers from the question. It also eliminates answers that may look similar but the actual words are never mentioned in the passage. Reading the passage makes people try and fit answers in to what they read instead of fitting an answer to what's actually stated. ",

For anything related to tone, I was told to read the first and last 5 lines. These tests literally seek only to find people who are familiar with the format or phenomenal test takers.

I was an excellent writter and she always gave me failing grades on some of my best work even still to this day. By failing grades I don't mean somewhere in the 60's, I'm talking around the 20's. Luckily I got my justice by the end of the semester. On our last assignment, a peer review over someone's definition of 'nonfiction' and then our own definition and reasoning of the word. I spent days on the paper. Had all of my sources cited and in text citations correct. When we got our grades back I was the only one to fail. I received a 28 on it. I took the paper and the assigned rurbric and highlighted everything she claimed I did wrong and gave it to the principle and another Language Arts teacher. They concluded I shpuld have made a low 'A'. She was then let go the next year due to that and having the highest fail rate out of all language arts classes in my county.",

I can write a few paragraphs but it takes me an extremely long time because I have to keep stopping and resting my hand until the pain subsides. I had an IEP in school, which in case that's just a Massachusetts thing is a special education requirement. It mandated that I either needed to be provided a computer and allowed to type, or provided a teaching assistant to dictate to. It was a fine system, until sophomore year of high school. My physics teacher would make us copy word for word entire sections of the textbook every night. She claimed it was about retention but I swear it was just busy work. When I returned it to her typed she demanded it be hand written. It became a constant struggle of me explaining to her my IEP and my condition, and her saying she didn't care and failing me. Long story short I wasn't put into her class again. \n\nI guess the positive take away was if I didn't flunk because of her, I wouldn't have retook the class, got an A, and met my favorite teacher I've ever had.

More funding to higher more teachers, have smaller class sizes, etc. could remedy this, but often your legislators take money from schools to fund a police state, foreign military intervention, etc. We can't have our cake and eat it too.

Malcolm Gladwell touches on this in his book Outliers, where he discusses how even very bright people who are born into poverty will have an incredibly hard time becoming successful simply because they learn to have a distrust of authority. Meanwhile, average kids in middle and high income families learn the unwritten rules of success. That is, you have to work with the system to get what you want. \n\nIf, for instance, a teacher is in the wrong, instead of cussing at her and getting expelled, a middle/upper class child is more likely to say nothing and have their parent contact the principal later, which will affect the child's chances of future success much less negatively over time.\n\nPart of what school teaches you is how to handle authority, because if you can't manage that by the time you're an adult you're gonna have a bad time.",

It goes beyond just the classroom, too.\n\nI mean, we talk a lot about how lower-income people tend to get killed the most by police.  Maybe it's because of a higher crime rate, but maybe it has something to do with a fundamental disconnect between authority figures and the people who are being policed, one that is strongly encouraged by what goes on in the classroom.\n\nCertainly there's other factors at play here, but it's not a single-cause issue.",

A middle class person and a lower class person may be put into the same unfair situation (being given a ticket due to their skin color) but the lower class person may not understand that the most likely way to get past the problem is by being nice, and calm, and apologetic even if you KNOW you are in the right. Maybe all they see is the injustice, and this rightly leads to anger, which is the most natural reaction, which in turn leads to escalation and inevitably violence....Meanwhile the middle/upper class person is pleasant, gets the ticket then protests it in court later. Nobody bothers showing up and they get off scot free while the former person is hurt, dead, or in jail. \n\nDefinitely some food for thought.",

You can say anything you want about how Shakespeare was thinking of his mother, or his favorite horse, or anything at all, when he wrote this or that sonnet, because he's not here to call out nonsense when it gets published.\n",

If one can seemingly relate a text to the real world around them, with themes and motifs and symbolism that are meaningful to the place one lives in, then the story is going to be way more satisfying and memorable to that person.\n\nNow, passing off these perceived relevant meanings in a text as the *author's* beliefs?  Or determining that their *opinion* of the text is the exclusive and right interpretation? That's a very large step that should be taken in much caution.",

Which of course is not the actual moral of the story, it's a bit too clever and still caught up in the metaphors used in the story.\n\nThe passage they gave was internally consistent, and actually had some interesting comments about how groups of people can trick themselves into a position that makes no sense out of fear, but I can see how it wouldn't have gone down well on a Grade 8 test.",

If I say that the main character never actually loved a certain character, you better support it with evidence. I was never asked \"What is the meaning behind the apple?\" and then told I was wrong. I was always asked for evidence for my answer and the teachers would tell me why that evidence did or didn't hold up. Literary analysis is absolutely great for teaching critical thinking precisely because there is no true right or wrong answer when interpreting text.  You give an answer, and that answer must be explained with evidence, logic and reasoning.\n\nI admit that on standardized tests (which are decided by a group divorced from the actual classroom proceedings) this isn't the case, but at the same time I would argue that if the goal is to test for critical thinking, reading a small passage from a novel or short story and answering definitive questions about that story is a shitty thing to do in the first place. However, that speaks more to the design of these standardized tests than it does about using literary analysis to teach critical thinking skills.",

I took a class in Russian romanticist lit from a guy that was extremely passionate about the subject. He lived and breathed 19th century Russian culture, spoke the language, and gave very in-depth and nuanced interpretations of the texts. I took meticulous notes on his theories on every text, and wrote all of my papers with the goal of providing evidence for contrary interpretations. He loved it and I did great in that class, we had great discussions, and I learned a ton about the subject that I never would have if I'd just regurgitated the notes from his lectures instead of challenging his perspectives. It was a better class for me, for him, and for the other students because he was the kind of guy that genuinely welcomed alternative viewpoints.\n\nFor every teacher like that guy, I had at least three or four that presented their own interpretation as incontrovertible fact and actively crushed any alternatives. The worst is when they're forced to teach something that isn't their specialty. I had a survey course on early British lit from a professor that focused on mid-20th century modern feminist lit. Her opinions on Beowulf were not nuanced, and there was no discussion whatsoever. \"Beowulf is a poem about a stupid manly man who brags and fights and dies, the end.\" God help you if you wrote a paper saying the poem has anything of value to offer to a 21st century reader, like that the text itself is ultimately critical of Beowulf's brash and selfish lifestyle and a metaphor for the British Saxons' anxiety about the invasions that eventually did occur.",

Any questions I ever missed, it was fairly common for my teachers to say \"Yeah, that was a bad question.\" and toss it out or curve the entire class' grades.\n\nTexas prides itself in not being part of Common Core, which in some cases that is great. But in terms of how it tries to test students, our standardized testing is basically just a lesson in learning probability. You try to guess your way through...and if it isn't math based, you can guess and do just about as well as if you \"took your time\" and \"underlined all the important information.\"\n\n",

It's somewhat reliant on the actual ability being tested, but a really big part of the result is just how good the student is at taking these sorts of tests.  I happen to have been really good at them and honestly, I think a lot of my success came from that over my actual subject matter knowledge.",

Interpretations *are* subjective, but only to a point - I tell my students, \"the right answer is the one you can support.\" Bearing that in mind, I cannot tell you the number of times I've had students of all ability levels come up with an interpretation that I hadn't and wouldn't have ever thought of (which has been one of the coolest parts of being a teacher btw), AND THEN support their argument by pointing to the text and citing evidence, which is **exactly** what they're supposed to learn and demonstrate! Unfortunately, the way the tests are written, students who are *still learning to interpret texts in the first place* often get fed someone *else's* interpretation, and are then asked to respond to that using multiple-choice questions (as this author demonstrates), because it's like trying to cram a square peg into a round hole. There are better methods of measuring these skills, but they're more time consuming and less \"reliable.\"",

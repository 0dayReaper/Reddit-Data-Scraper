    "postText": "It's not a tragic romance about true love- it's a warning not to let yourself be ruled by your emotions alone.\n\nThe parents are ruled by a grudge preventing the happiness of their children and causing violence and death in the town they live in because neither wants to forgive the other. Like, their *unnamed* grudge causes fights to break out in the streets, causes deaths of people who have nothing to do with their grudge. You could make the argument that the fact that no one can name what caused this animosity, that it must not have even been so terrible, and they are holding onto it all out of pride.\n\nRomeo is introduced to us by saying how he wants to *kill himself* because his romance with Rosaline ended, then immediately falls in love with the first cute chick he sees that same night, implying that he falls in love easily- that he is more in love with being in love than anything else. This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare's couples in other plays, we really don't get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than \"in love\". Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination? What, other than appearance, makes her worthy of your obsession? He never takes the time to praise anything other than her surface qualities.\n\nRomeo allows his obsession to shut down any thought of the potential consequences in eloping with Juliet. This is seen by how cluelessly he responds to Tybalt on encountering him, post marriage. He doesn't even behave rationally, just thinking: Well, I love Juliet and she loves you, therefore we're buds now.\n\nAs for Tybalt, his failure is giving in to blind rage, provoking a fight between himself and Romeo, which results in Tybalt's death.\n\nMercutio is pissed cuz he knew all of this needless fighting and death was based on these two families being made up of absolute drama queens all worked up over some straight-up bullshit and that *none of this had to be this way,* but because Romeo is his himbo friend he goes ahead and gets murked trying to keep his buddy from killing himself. This is why he dies like: \"For the record, you guys' families are toxic af. Bleeehhhhh...\"\n\nFinally, if Romeo had given a moment to think about *anything at all* in the crypt (self-reflection, analyzing the damage this family grudge has done to everyone, commentary on the crypt's interior decor) rather than *immediately making decisions based on his powerful emotions* neither Romeo nor Juliet would have died.\n\nStop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are *often* influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They *need* to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: no, I didn't *just* realize this. I am frustrated because as a librarian that works with teens, I have heard this is how it's being taught to them, and when I was in high school I was also taught to interpret it as a sad love story about true love. I am frustrated to hear that it is still being taught this way by at least some teachers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit edit: I did not add the spoiler tag. No clue why it's there, but meh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit the 3rd: Some of you guys are thinking I see this as my raison d'etre or that I'm rabidly angry about this, but really it's just an annoyance. I ended up really liking Shakespeare in college but the way Romeo and Juliet was taught to me in high school had left me feeling frustrated and angry and I just assumed it was because I must not like Shakespeare. So I missed out on really enjoying his works for years because I assumed that my frustration was with Shakespeare's work, rather than my teacher's interpretation of it. ",

            "comment": "First of all, you are misusing the word \"allegory\".\n\nYes, the story is about characters making emotional decisions and tragically dying, but that's just the plot on it's face. *That's what a tragic romance looks like.*\n\nYou are describing a sequence of events, but they aren't an allegory *for something else*.\n\nIt's not like Romeo symbolically represents a Shakespeare-era politician who let himself be guided by obsessions, leading to his downfall. It's not like the two families are allegorical representations of the rivalry between protestantism and catholicism.\n\nThe story has a pretty straightforward narrative, that IS presented as a romantic tragedy.\n\nThat a tragedy ends in bloodshed is not a subversive hidden message, that is just how tragedies work. You might as well say that \"Hamlet isn't a revenge story, it is actually a warning about how revenge can cost you everything.\"\n\nIT IS BOTH. It is a type of revenge story, and within that category, it is a tragical one. \n\nLikewise, Romeo and Juliet's main conflict is a romantic one, and it's resolution is a tragical one. It's a romantic tragedy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Stop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are *often* influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They *need* to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.\n\nBeing ruled by your passions, IS romantic. That's what the name of the genre means.\n\nEvery romcom movie with a highly illegal and reckless airport chase scene, every fantasy romance where the power of love vanquishes armies, and every romantic tragedy that portrays love as being worth throwing your life away for, is fundamentally about heightened emotional states over sensible behavior.\n\nWhat teenagers need to hear is that real life is not always romantic, not that fantastical stories only count as romantic if they have a practical life advice.\n\nThere is no benefit from redefining romance to only mean stories about safe, wholesome, level-headed relationships, and to read every story more intense than that, as \"not really a romance\" but an intentional warning about the dangers of passion.",

It was pointed out to me in Grad school for Spanish literature that the true meaning of Romantic is that love or emotions are so overpowering, that a true Romantic can't withstand them, surrenders to them and, ideally, dies or is killed for them as a result. It made me immediately think about Romeo &amp; Juliet and how it's taught, without anyone ever touching on that idea. Perhaps because I was young, I didn't really get it, but as an adult, it's interesting to rediscover books I read back in the day.",

However, that isn\u2019t how most Shakespeare scholars classify them, and my understanding is that even in Shakespeare\u2019s time they recognized that there were more genres.  There were the medieval romances (which, unlike the current genre, weren\u2019t really love stories\u2014they were stories set in a far off place with magic/etc. in them).\n\nThe general categorizations for Shakespeares plays are either: \u201ccomedies, tragedies, and historical works\u201d (one of the early categorizations, e.x. In the first folio), or \u201ccomedies, tragedies, historical works, and romances\u201d (in the historical sense) (which is what scholars studying Shakespeares works settled on a few hundred years ago, iirc).\n\nThe Tempest is one of the plays that draws heavily on the structure of earlier romances, so although in the First Folio it and several other plays were originally categorized as \u201ccomedies\u201d, it is now generally considered one of his romances.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely correct that the correct genre for Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, though \u2014 it has always been characterized that way.  It\u2019s literally in the full title of the material that Shakespeare built his play on, which was a poem called \u201cThe Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet\u201d.  It also follows the classic structure of a tragedy.\n\nSource:  Let\u2019s just say when you grow up with an English professor who specializes in the renaissance you pick up a few things.",

Either Tragedies or Comedies. They're only called Histories because they're writing about a real person that is politically relevant. Richard is a History, but Caesar (Also about a real person) is a Tragedy. \n\nI can understand the logic of the third genre, but largely everything in that third genre fits into the classic Comedy or Tragedy play genres like the rest. They're simply in a third genre for political reasons, not play writing ones.\n\nEdit:\nUpvoted for being correct and informative, as you're right that technically there is a third genre. \n\nAlso they have tried to have other genres, but that never sticks.

It gets a bit complex if you look at the actual scholarship about Shakespeare\u2019s plays and what was going on at the time in larger English playwriting.\n\nFor example, the Folger (one of the biggest repositories of Shakespeare\u2019s texts &amp; a major driver of Renaissance scholarship in the US) categorizes the works into tragedy/comedy/history.  (See: https://www.folger.edu/shakespeares-works). That categorization is a pretty common one and largely accepted among scholars these days, and dates back to the 1890s.  (See:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_late_romances for a decent history of the reasons for that.)\n\nThe reason those plays wound up getting re-categorized by scholars is that they have very distinct, stylistic differences from his comedies, tragedies, and histories.  My understanding is that was possibly caused by influences from the development of the stylistically distinct tragicomedy in English playwriting (which happened partway through Shakespeare\u2019s life).\n\nThere have been other attempts to further divide Shakespeares works, for example with the \u201cProblem Plays\u201d (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean_problem_play), but those were less well defined in my opinion.  However the term is still used by some scholars.\n\nSo\u2014in the end this winds up being fairly complex, and really we should have defined goal of categorizing them in the first place.  Are we discussing them in the context of how they\u2019re studied and thought about today &amp; the overall structure of the plays and themes they engage with, or are we discussing them in the context of the classic Greek dichotomies, or are we just going to go with how Shakespeare\u2019s peers grouped them?\n\nI tend towards (perhaps obviously :) ) approaching Shakespeare\u2019s work through the lense of more modern scholarship and think the argument for the late romances being stylistically distinct enough to warrant another category if you\u2019re attempting to divide up his plays\u2014they don\u2019t have quite the same structure of a comedy or a tragedy.",

As I mentioned\u2014there are other attempts to subdivide his plays, and historically they were divided by his colleagues into comedies/tragedies/histories in the first folio.\n\nMy take is that the romances are distinct in structure, tone, and style from Shakespeare\u2019s other tragedies and comedies, so it\u2019s reasonable to group them separately and treat them as a separate \u201cgenre\u201d of his work.  AFAIK that\u2019s generally accepted in the modern scholarship on them (and has been for over 100 years \u2014 the proposal of that categorization was in the 1890s).",

To the people of the time, two young people following their emotions instead of their families' wishes would've been incredibly romantic and showed how passionate they were about each other.",

This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare's couples in other plays, we really don't get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than \"in love\". Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination?\n\nIf we are supposed to take their passion for each other at face value, the play probably could have done more to motivate the audience's understanding of, and sympathy for, that passion. The transition from the two not knowing one another to the two being wildly, passionately (and suicide-inducingly) in love with each other seems quite fast and lacking in clear motivation beyond the fact that they think the other is attractive and they are both in an emotionally vulnerable place.\n\nObviously, there is an alchemy to these things, but I still think the OPs point that at the very least Romeo (and possibly Juliet as well), were *looking* for a reason to die tragically and romantically has at least some story detail to recommend it. If the story of Romeo and Juliet having been lovers surreptitiously for an extended period of time only to brutally forced apart by the Capulet family marrying off Juliet to someone else, than the idea that two star-crossed lovers were *forced* to make a tragic choice by family and circumstance would have more purchase with me.\n\nSince that isn't the case, then I think either:  \n1) There is at least some truth to the OPs idea that this story is partially about the stupid things young people do motivated by what they think is love but what is actually blind infatuation (and/or that some young people\u2014especially romantics\u2014yearn for the grave).  \n2) Shakespeare did a lot of *telling* us Romeo and Juliet's relationship is one we, as the audience, should take seriously as true love, but could have done a lot more to *show* us why that is.",

She has to be utterly na\u00efve and innocent for the story to work. Romeo is older, and Juliet is not the first girl that Romeo falls in \"love\" with. Rosaline is old enough to be wise to young, horny men and goes so far as to tell Romeo she's taking a vow of chastity to get him to leave her alone. Romeo is a young man eager to experience sex in an age where it was blasphemous to do so before marriage, and Juliet is a young girl experiencing her very first romance. If Juliet were old enough to have experienced a suitor or two, she'd see Romeo coming a mile away just like Rosaline did, and turn him down. She's crazy young because the story won't work otherwise.",

He wasn't seeking an answer as much as he was deeply pursuing a question about why things are the way they are, or how humans operate, and then pushing that to the extreme to make for an entertaining story.\n\nAnd he very rarely engages in \"moralizing\" - or providing people clear takeaways about how a person should behave. He was much more interested in exploring the way that people behave than in moralizing about their behavior.\n\nRomeo and Juliet is an exploration of the tragedy of a city divided by hatred. And in that exploration, Shakespeare's *much* more concerned with telling a good story with lots of juicy drama than with moralizing.\n\nAlso, many people talk about the idiocy of Romeo and Juliet (here the OP talks about the recklessness of their \"emotional decision making\"), but that's not likely how R&amp;J would have been understood at the time. A \"secret marriage\" was common enough at the time, and in plays especially was a common trope - not just employed by \"evil\" characters, or by young and dumb characters. And while to us Romeo and Juliet seem too young for this stuff, at the time they were at a reasonable age for marriage. Their behavior would have been perfectly relatable at the time and it is our modern lens which interprets R&amp;J as simply hormone-driven teenagers.\n\nAny interpretation of Shakespeare which tries to two-dimensionalize the characters is going to be a bad interpretation.\n\nThis kind of uninformed analysis is incredibly common when Shakespeare is consumed and analyzed as *literature*. But Romeo and Juliet is *not* literature. It was written as a *play* and intended to be *performed*. And as an actor, Shakespeare knew that good characters were ones with a lot of humanity and depth - that could be related to in many ways by both actor and audience alike. Performance requires making choices about the character you are a playing - there is no one interpretation of Romeo, there are many, and each interpretation of his character will provide different windows into who this character could be and may provide different benefits or drawbacks to a performance. And after an actor is done making their choices, audience members will see different things in that performance and derive their own interpretation. This is an important *feature* of the medium of theatre.\n\nAbsolutely, Romeo and Juliet could be played as these two dimensional, hyper-emotional teenagers. But that would make for a pretty bad performance and wouldn't do much justice to the text.",

The Montague's lost Romeo , the Capulets lost Juliet and Tybalt and the Prince's family lost Mercutio, hence why the Prince says \"all are punished\". I never felt it was a warning for Romeo and Juliet's love or a romantization of their love, but rather their love was seen as a someone inevitability, albeit a sort of worst case scenario one. At some point a Montague and a Capulet we're going to fall in love and want to get married. At some point the feuding between the two families was going to spill over catastrophically.",

The rushed timeframe of R+J is deliberate in my opinion. Shakespeare was not the type of writer to do things for the sake of convenience. It\u2019s usually assumed that if it\u2019s written a certain way, it\u2019s written that way for a legitimate reason, not just because that\u2019s how plays were. There were a lot of playwrights who were utilizing longer timeframe plays at the time. People like Ben Jonson and William Wycherley both wrote plays like that, as did Spenser, and Marlowe. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for a play to span longer periods of time. Not saying it was the norm, but not uncommon.  \n\nAll that to say, I like to assume that if Shakespeare wrote it a certain way, it was intentional, not to fit any norms or convenience. But I\u2019m also guilty of glorifying him and his writings. The fact that R+J takes place over the course of a few days draws attention to the fact that this is a story about two young lovers who are trapped in the middle of an ongoing family feud.",

I would say Othello is a much better example of an illustration of the dangers of acting on emotion. His jealousy opens him up to manipulation by Iago, poisoning his relationship with Desdemona and making him doubt her love for him. \n\n4. Romeo and Juliet do act emotionally, but they also were forced into a series of emotional decisions they would not have made on their own; their families' enmity meant that they could never enjoy their love within the only structure society allowed, a marriage, and they could not accept the idea of loving or marrying other people. Even today in some cultures, lovers who are forbidden to be together, or who are ordered to marry people they do not love, commit suicide out of desperation. Drastic? Yes. But for some, the idea of being forced into a loveless marriage is unbearable. This is especially true for women in societies that do not value women's autonomy because once married, there is no possible escape, only lifetime ahead of bearing children with no recourse from any emotional or physical abuse, possibly within an extended family structure that will further remove choices from them. This may be unimaginable for those in western society, but it's the harsh reality for many women. It would have been reality for Juliet, as well.",

Plus the witches don\u2019t really count because they also move the action, which the R+J chorus doesn\u2019t do, unless you are staging or recasting the same actors in order to make the point.",

It's not really \"about\" Romeo and Juliet, they're more the catalist of family drama. I mean, what does the book say is the moral of the story at the end? You have that big old father's speech where they talk about their foolishness and how they're no longer going to fight and such. That seems to be the focus, and it's accentuated several times among the story (for example: when that friend dies he curses the families).",

Romeo and Juliet are impulsive and foolish, but if the two families hadn't been feuding they would have actually been excellent marriage candidates for each other. (Similar age, social status, etc.) And if anything, the \"forbidden\" aspect of their love is probably what pushes them to move more quickly than they would have otherwise. They can't have a regular courtship, so they opt for a secret marriage instead, obviously hoping for a \"better to ask forgiveness than permission\" kind of thing. They can't separate them if they're already married, right? But then the animosity between their families just pulls them down into this vortex of disaster and death that they can't escape from. It *is* about young, impulsive love and acting on physical attraction--I'm pretty sure there's a line where Shakespeare directly says they have nothing but attraction to go on--but in a large sense, about the evils of grudges and hatred, and how it can destroy everything around you.",

Every tragedy is, by definition, a cautionary tale. But it's also a romance. \n\n&gt; Stop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are often influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They need to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.\n\nNo. I will continue to teach it as a romantic tragedy that was absolutely pivotal to the romance genre, and I will continue to romanticize all the lines that Shakespeare intended as flowery, romantic lines. *And* I will continue to point out how it's a tragedy with flawed characters that, through their flaws, are relatable. I will teach the play as a multifaceted and complex piece of literature. What I won't do is what your teachers did and what you want to do, which is prescribe some singular genre or lesson that precludes any other lens or appreciation for it.\n\nAlso, forgive the snark, but this revelation of yours is honestly what most teenagers hit upon when they read the play. It's become a meme, honestly. It's a realization that the main characters are impulsive teenagers who let their emotions get the best of them, and shouldn't be emulated. But that's just a cursory understanding of the play. The next step is to understand and appreciate the romantic language and tropes even while understanding the characters are flawed, and to understand how their rebellion can simultaneously be foolhardy *and* a virtuous critique of the even more tragic conflict between their families. Shakespeare isn't hailed as the greatest English playwright because his plays are one dimensional and have singular messages to be hailed as the \"correct\" way of reading.\n\n(And this is beside the point, but something isn't an allegory just because it has a moral. An allegory has extended metaphors that serve as direct parallels to the message. If any story with a message were an allegory, every story would be one.)",

You seem to think teens should be only fed non-problematic stories, ostensibly because they can\u2019t think for themselves. As a younger person I think that\u2019s quite patronizing; anyone is capable of understanding the love in this play had terrible consequences.

The way you speak about this makes you just as bad as the teachers you are against. Books and literature should be able to be interpretted however by the reader. That is their beauty. You saying that this is the way Romeo and Juliet must be interpretted is just as bad as the teachers saying it must be interpretted as a romance. If someone wants to interpret it differently than you and takes away different things from it, then so be it. This is the problem with the way books are taught. It does not teach critical thinking skills or instill a love for reading. It just becomes adults shoving their own views down kids/teens throats. Literature is not a my way or the high way situation and I think you should rethink this. Romeo and Juliet shouldn\u2019t be taught in either way, it should be allowed to be interpretted by the person who is reading it. Of course you can have your own opinions, but it should not end up being a, \u201cNO WAY CAN THIS BE SEEN AS SUCH\u201d.",

Shakespeare presents both fatalistic and free will views, repeatedly across multiple works. He gives enough information to reach either conclusion, which parallels then very common debates between Calvinists and their opponents. \n\nTo me, that\u2019s one of the deeper threads of Shakespeare and a theme that has produced so many wonderful quotes, too: The fault is not in our stars, I am fortunes fool, etc. Some of the most famous villains in his works, like Iago and Edmund, reject fate in favor of free will, and vice versa. \n\nYour reading is certainly a common one but a) I don\u2019t think that prevents it from being a tragic romance and b) Shakespeare also allowed for a different kind of mostly environmental determinism that you can really see in the plays that touch on this the most.",

(thinking back, there was *a lot* of drama with the high school couples.)\n\nAnd I just sat back and looked at them like \"did we read the same thing? cause this is all sorts of fucked up.\"",

And the utter waste of the deaths of their children is such a huge consequence for these families that they finally make up. They were star-crossed lovers, though, which does technically make it a tragic love story in part.",

The whole thing opens with the two titular characters coming out of romances and immediately falling in love. It's a tragedy because they act on emotion only and take their own lives out of stupidity. And it's completely lost on teenagers because they're right in that cloud of hormonal angst.",

There also seems to be a lot of repetition. What am I missing? If course in the context of the time it was written and it's significance to our understanding of history cannot be overstated, but am I the only one who finds it an uninteresting read?",

So it\u2019s a very different thing for us. If you do keep on with it I would think of reading it as a window into a different world, rather than reading it for what we usually want out of a novel (empathy with characters, plotting etc).",

            "comment": "You're not missing anything. The Iliad is basically a who's who and who did what of a big war. Anyone who was anyone showed up for the siege of Troy and the Iliad is essentially the record of their deeds to give credit where credit's due.\n\nSo if you're not interested in tracing all of these people and their deeds, the story won't hold that much interest.\n\nThe second major hurdle is that the Iliad is a poem. It's meant to be spoken, not read. And when poems get translated, there's always a conflict. Do you go with the most literal translation even if it means modern readers might not grasp the metaphors? The translation that captures the poetry even if it means departing further from the original text? Or even a translation that tries to recapture the feel or reciting the poem.\n\nFor example, there's a wonderful passage where Homer compares the ranks of the army to waves in the sea. And he intentionally fills the sentences with rolling vowels and liquid sssounds. [Some translations try to use modern similes for the visuals, others try to capture the rolling sloshing sound of the sentences.](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/englishing-the-iliad-grading-four-rival-translations)\n\nSo yeah, if you're just reading the Iliad for an exciting story, you might come away disappointed. But there's much more to it than that, if you care to dig it out.",

The Iliad is all about man's struggle against fate, the brutality of war, and the fleeting beauty of life. These characters aren't designed for you to empathize with them, but rather to witness their mortal plight against the cosmic and divine.\n\nThe repetition, well, it's a technique. You're listening to an oral tale, a beatbox narrative spun by some ancient Greek version of Eminem. Each repetition is a new track, a new chance to fall into the rhythm and flow of the story. Each character, each battle, is another verse in this ancient rap.\n\nIt's okay if you're not in love with the Iliad. You're not alone. But if you step back, if you see the Iliad as a living fossil of human thought and narrative structure, you might find a strange kind of beauty in it. You might find a new appreciation for these stiff, regal characters in their unwinnable battles. And you might find that their struggles aren't so different from your own.",

This means it will not be as good as an English text because the translator needs to make decisions about which mean the emphasize and which to toss out.

The first is an oral presentation and the second is a written compilation of the various strand that came down.\n3. It is old. Like Gawain and the Green Knight or The Talmud. This means you must go to it, not the other way around. \n4. If you want to know how powerful it is, think about all the telling and retellings. You may not like Illiad, plenty do not, but recognize other people have come to a different conclusion.\n5. Odyssey is more approachable.\n6.

It is perhaps most interesting as a study on the question: for what should a human risk his life?",

Yet, What makes a Greek hero the most heroic is how much he suffers. Everything up until Book 24 echoes the idea of honor in warfare which is the entirety of the conflict in book 1 and of course book 5 would focus on how adept in warfare Diomedes is, because that makes him a great Greek hero per the terms of the culture. But nothing in books 1-21 show how much a hero has suffered.\n\nBut if you look at this through the tragic hero lens, you begin to see things change as early as book 9. When the other soldiers try to convince Achilles to return, he begins changing his tune about being the best warrior and deserving the most. He tells them that basically whether you\u2019re good at fighting or not, we all end up the same. This is echoed in Troy when he tells Patroclus that all the souls of the men he\u2019s killed are waiting for him on the Styx, \u201cthey say, \u2018welcome brother,\u2018\u201d implying he feels he is equal to the other soldiers. Even in Book 1, he asks Agamemnon why he\u2019s even there, the Trojans haven\u2019t bothered him or taken his things, so what\u2019s the point of the war?\n\nBut the turning point, the peripeteia of the tragic hero cycle is when he violates Greek and Trojan death rituals in book 22. This is where his hubris has led him to make really wrong decisions, thus initiating the downfall. But before the downfall, the tragic hero has an anagnorisis or sudden understanding. This happens in book 24 for Achilles, when he breaks down and sobs over what he\u2019s done and what his father would think of him. He does the amazing, heroic by our standards thing and he acts like a decent human being.\n\nBut what\u2019s most important is the last line of book 24: Thus was the funeral of Hector, breaker of horses.\n\nIf this poem is all about how amazing Greek fighters are, why did Homer end the poem with a line about a Trojan? Because what Achilles and Hector were fighting for were vastly different things and Achilles understood that in the end. I make this point to my kids, noting that the general idea is Homer, a Greek, understood and empathized with a Trojan, whose land was destroyed, it\u2019s people hurt, all because Mycenae wanted trade routes. So this makes Hector the true, epic hero and Achilles the tragic hero.\n\nSo, yes. It\u2019s anti-war.",

The Trojans are repeatedly seen to be their equals on the battlefield, and the balance of the battle only changes because of the actions of the Gods.\n\nIt is a poem which is truthful about war. If you want to focus on the hard truths then you might think it as anti-war but it is also a story about how thrilling war is, how important it is to the construction of masculine identities in ancient Greece, how it makes you the closest thing there is to a God. Saying The Iliad is anti-war is like saying Moby-Dick is anti-whale.\n\nOr as a modern Homer once put it:\n&gt;How do you generalize? War is hell, but that\u2019s not the half of it, because war is also mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love. War is nasty; war is fun. War is thrilling; war is drudgery. War makes you a man; war makes you dead. \n\n&gt;The truths are contradictory. It can be argued, for instance, that war is grotesque. But in truth war is also beauty. For all its horror, you can\u2019t help but gape at the awful majesty of combat. You stare out at tracer rounds unwinding through the dark like brilliant red ribbons. You crouch in ambush as a cool, impassive moon rises over the nighttime paddies. You admire the fluid symmetries of troops on the move, the harmonies of sound and shape and proportion, the great sheets of metal-fire streaming down from a gunship, the illumination rounds, the white phosphorus, the purply orange glow of napalm, the rocket\u2019s red glare. It\u2019s not pretty, exactly. It\u2019s astonishing. It fills the eye. It commands you. You hate it, yes, but your eyes do not. Like a killer forest fire, like cancer under a microscope, any battle or bombing raid or artillery barrage has the aesthetic purity of absolute moral indifference\u2014a powerful, implacable beauty\u2014and a true war story will tell the truth about this, though the truth is ugly. \n\n&gt;To generalize about war is like generalizing about peace. Almost everything is true. Almost nothing is true. At its core, perhaps, war is just another name for death, and yet any soldier will tell you, if he tells the truth, that proximity to death brings with it a corresponding proximity to life. After a fire-fight, there is always the immense pleasure of aliveness. The trees are alive. The grass, the soil\u2014everything. All around you things are purely living, and you among them, and the aliveness makes you tremble. You feel an intense, out-of-the-skin awareness of your living self\u2014your truest self, the human being you want to be and then become by the force of wanting it. In the midst of evil you want to be a good man. You want decency. You want justice and courtesy and human concord, things you never knew you wanted. There is a kind of largeness to it, a kind of godliness. Though it\u2019s odd, you\u2019re never more alive than when you\u2019re almost dead. You recognize what\u2019s valuable. Freshly, as if for the first time, you love what\u2019s best in yourself and in the world, all that might be lost. At the hour of dusk you sit at your foxhole and look out on a wide river turning pinkish red, and at the mountains beyond, and although in the morning you must cross the river and go into the mountains and do terrible things and maybe die, even so, you find yourself studying the fine colors on the river, you feel wonder and awe at the setting of the sun, and you are filled with a hard, aching love for how the world could be and always should be, but now is not.",

For me Hector was the one I was drawn to, his leadership in defense of the city during that long war.  It\u2019s a war story and a war story that rings true, as someone who has never served I found it enlightening.  It\u2019s also beautifully written but that will depend on the translation.  I read the Fitzgerald. \n\nIt\u2019s many more things that I haven\u2019t touched on.  Achilles for one.  I think things will become more enjoyable for you as you settle into the long war.  I absolutely loved it but couldn\u2019t keep the gods straight.   Its obviously very different than a modern novel but the great epics present a lot that modern novels don\u2019t as well.  In the end it\u2019s worth it even if you don\u2019t love it like I do.",

I didn\u2019t make it through. I tried several more times and probably didn\u2019t make through until college (one of my majors was English), but still didn\u2019t really enjoy it. What I did really enjoy was The Odyssey. Just because something is great lit, or enjoyed by many doesn\u2019t mean we will all love it. You may like other epic poetry better. You may like a different translator better. Or to learn to read it in as close to the original as possible (my apologies if you can already do this). \n\nI also think you\u2019re right; these aren\u2019t empathetic characters. They\u2019re not meant to be. It\u2019s the story of fate and destiny and how those cannot be turned, how they\u2019re bigger than the individual. I think you have to find the story of human struggle and and ancient history interesting. You have to be interested in epic poetry and ancient mythology and definitely in politics in general. You have to be interested in learning about the general time period by looking up relevant information.",

If you don't like this one and you really want to carry on reading you can always try another translation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may help you (it did for me) to read a book based off of it as well, Troy: The Siege of Troy is written by Stephen Fry and feels a bit like a YA re-telling.  \"The Woman of Troy\" Series by Pat Barker both gave me context to tackle my old penguin classics version.",

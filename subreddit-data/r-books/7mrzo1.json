    "postText": "I'm very dyslexic. I didn't find out until I was 18 so I've just figured out ways to deal with it. At the beginning of the year I decided that I wanted to read at least one book in its entirety. I ended up reading 9 (which is more than I've ever read on my own in my life!) and gaining a whole new respect and love for reading. For me, reading was alway a very labored activity, I never enjoyed it. Now I read for enjoyment and I can understand why others do it too. Also I believe it has truly helped my dyslexia. \n\nEdit 1: OH MY GOSH I did not expect this to blow up like this! You guys are so supportive and it's so amazing to hear all of your stories!\n\nEdit 2: GOLD! I'm flabbergasted! To whoever gave me gold thank you thank you thank you!!\n\nEdit 3: Seriously this is an amazing sub and you are all very kind. I can't wait to read through all of the comments. Everyone on here is so incredibly supportive.",

I found books on tape back in the early 1990s and I have been addicted to them ever since. \n\nI have had an audible.com account since 2007 with over 1000 books. I am a welder so I can listen while I work. \n\nWhen I am at home I listen and read at the same time with my kindle. I do this with books that have a lot of names, poetry and most non-fiction.  \n\nI can get lost when I can\u2019t  keep track of people or I have trouble visualizing events. So some times have a who\u2019s who cheat sheet (La Miserable and War and Peace) or I\u2019ll just take notes.\n\nGood luck this year.\n\nEdit #1 Thank You for the Gold! I never expected anything like this. \n            For me learning to read was simple (HA HA)  once someone explained the basic rules. Over and over and over and over etc. The summer of 1975, 5th grade, 2 hours a day 4 days a week for whole summer. I spent the next 7 years working with tutors explaining the rules of reading, grammar and other stuff.\n\n            As far as welding goes I use earbuds that look like safety earplugs. Welding generates a 60 Hz frequency that with long term exposure causes hearing loss. On a good day i'll get 8 hours of listening.\n\n            For those who are looking for a tutor to help, please check if they are trained in the Orton-Gillingham method. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orton-Gillingham. Also I you can get a medical doctor to sign the paperwork, Dyslexics qualify for Recorded Books for the Blind.  \n",

You are able to quickly figure out which part of the letter is down which aids in recognizing the correct letter, and sometimes helps to keep your brain from rotating them around. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reinforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent confusion through flipping and swapping.\u201c",

The \"automatic deciphering\" makes it harder for dyslexic people to read since they get the wrong word first and have to read it again carefully to try to get the right one.

Part of the problem with normal fonts is a lot of letters look the same. I find that my brain by default flips letters. The visual special side hits first before the reading part of my brain. So instead of being automatic, I have to sort out which one of these  (b,d,cl,p,q) is correct for each word. With the dyslexic font I find I can read almost automatic because the letters don't flip to be the same. ",

I love the Paperwhite (I think it's $120 new, but you can buy it refurbished for under $100) it's back lit and easy on the eyes. It's 100%  worth the money. \n\n\nA regular Kindle that is just as good is $80. It's just not back-lit. \n\n\nIf you like the dyslexic font idea, a Kindle has worked great for me personally. \n\n\n",

The bottom weighting pulls my focus towards the bottom too much. \n\nI actually did a comparison study over the last couple days of fonts most commonly used by dyslexics and compiled a list of them, then I compared them on ebooks, text editor, and online(reddit). \n\nIt was very fun comparing the fonts, and checking what I respond to. And I'm glad I did, the fonts that I switched to make working with words very fun and easy. I feel like I can work with words (reading, writing, editing) forever now, before there was a 'friction' and 'fatigue' factor, if that makes sense. \n\nAnyways, here's the list I compiled\n\n----Top Tier-----\n\nMcLauren (for online)\n\nSF Cartoonist hand (for ebooks)\n\nSniglet\n\nLexie Readable\n\nVerdana (for editing)\n\nBoogaloo\n\nWellfleet\n\n------Not top tier but would switch these in on occasion for flavor ------\n\nBubblegum Sans\n\nComic Sans\n\nJollygood sans\n\ncomic neue\n\ncomic neue angular\n\nContemporary Brush\n\nFreehand\n\nComic Relief\n\nAngkor\n\nBattambang\n\nBayon\n\nWellfleet\n\nAmaranth\n\nDekko\n\nArchitects Daughter\n\nChenla\n\nTaprom\n\nChelsea Market\n\nFresca\n\nPatrick Hand\n\n-------Not for me, but perhaps others may like them ---------\n\nAbeeZee\n\nAcme\n\nDangrek \n\nChewy\n\npangolin\n\nKomika\n\nQuarmic Sans\n\nMV Boli\n\nThere is one more font though, developed for dyslexics, that doesn't have side-weighting like the open dyslexic or dyslexie fonts. It is Read Regular, but I still haven't found a place to download that font. \n\nIf you want to check out the post where I documented my findings, it's here https://np.reddit.com/r/Dyslexia/comments/7m1l9y/anyone_tried_dyslexic_fonts_outside_of_of_gill/\n\nIt's still not done yet. I'm going to add the ebook readers and online tools that allow me to change the fonts. Actually I'll have to rewrite whole thing since it's a stream of thoughts atm. ",

Also for you sail_fast123 I would recommend anything written by Christopher Moore, 'Lamb' and 'A Dirty Job' are excellent reads with some sick humor. \n\nedit: Also congrats on achieving your goal and much more buddy.

You can download the app and read everything in your library on your phone. You can also adjust most settings to make it easier to read, like changing fonts, text size, brightness, and inverting colors (white text on black instead of black on white...saves battery and eyeballs). I read books when I'm in transit or standing in line all the time using this app, it really makes it easier to get through books. \n\n2) Check out the Kindle Daily Deal every day for 5+ severely discounted eBooks. They regularly put books that are $10+ on sale for $1-3, and higher priced books on sale for $5. I check this obsessively, have for years, and have acquired an immense eBook library at a steep discount for about the cost of a cup of coffee each day. \n\n3) Never pay for books written in English and published before 1926. These books are in the public domain and you can get them for free. Many publishers try to sell \"their\" version, which might have cleaned up text or illustrations, but you don't need to pay for these because free legal versions exist. Almost all of these are \"classics\". Examples include books by Mark Twain (Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer), Charles Dickens (Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities), The Man in the Iron Mask, The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, all the Sherlock Holmes stories, all the Wizard of Oz books, and thousands more. If you search a title and sort by price, you can find the free versions in the Kindle store. \n\n\n",

You are able to quickly figure out which part of the letter is down which aids in recognizing the correct letter, and sometimes helps to keep your brain from rotating them around. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reinforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent confusion through flipping and swapping.](https://opendyslexic.org/about-2/)",

The first one took forever to get through, but I was still hooked. If you're reading something that excites you it'll just keep getting easier and easier.\n\nNow I'm a voracious reader and find my dyslexia only makes it difficult when I'm distracted or tired.

So do give them a try at some point, though keep going with your print copies as you sound like you're really enjoying it. The main thing for me was just how quick a lot of books are in audio, there's tons that are only around 8 to 10 hours. And even huge book like Lord of the Ring and Game of Throne aren't to bad in terms of length of the audio version. Also they can be great for things like road trips or doing chores when its kind of not an option to use a physical book.",

Not to patronise, but this is what I tell my students. Good luck and keep discovering! ",

I looked at everyone else and thought that because I was a slow reader and because it took so much effort that it wasn't worth trying to read a book. This was getting me nowhere. So eventually I just made a goal of one book. In all honesty the first book took 3.5 months to read. I would read 3-4 pages at a time and eventually one day I read 15 pages in a sitting and it was like I was standing on top of the world. The more I started to read the more different letters and sounds start to make sense in my brain and the easier it gets.    \n\nAlso I started making character/setting maps where I would write down different characters and places and how they all connected to each other so it was easier to understand the actual story. \n\nFinally I tried to pick books in the beginning that I knew I would I would enjoy. That way the story line would be engaging enough to finish.  \n\nI'm not a fast reader this was never about speed but now I enjoy it, which is something I think I really missed learning in childhood.

            "comment": "I was fortunate that my dyslexia was found very early.  I had special classes for it, I'm pretty sure I was in first or second grade.  I became a voracious reader after that; I would read anything I could get my hands on, and find ways to stay up every night reading into the small hours of the morning.  I would read my favorite books many times over.\n\n(Of course, that all stopped once I had a computer and a private internet connection in my room :\\\\)\n\nPoint is, a) dyslexia can absolutely be overcome, and b) it's definitely something parents should be aware of, and seek treatment for if their kids show signs.  I believe one of the big signs I had was I would sometimes write things as a perfect mirror image, not sure if there were others.",

At first it was hard and horrible.. I think we avoid reading because it reminds us of the dyslexia. Then after one book I was hooked! I've read 6 books this year and now I'm so into it in reading 4 at the same time haha ! It has massively helped my dyslexia and my general cognitive function and I'm so glad I did it. Super happy someone else has done the same thing this year !!",

    "postText": "My example: every year for the past 4 years I have picked up and DNF'd *The Bell Jar* by Sylvia Plath. I totally understand how the discussions of women's mental health and societal expectations were ahead of its time. I also get how Esther's struggles with mental illnesses resonate with many readers; my issue reading it is that the book is so effective at portraying Esther's depression and anxieties as unpleasant and all-consuming that I don't find it enjoyable to read. The first time I read it I was really frustrated watching Esther throw away all the great opportunities she had before her and how she had all this talent and drive that she wasn't acting on and it eventually struck me like \"yeah, that's the point; her mental illness mixed with stiflingly expectations for women are preventing from being happy and pursuing her dreams. The frustration I'm feeling is intentional.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is a book you couldn't finish/found unpleasant because it did its job too well?",

My recommendation is as soon as you get the syllabus for a class, Google search the books listed on it to see if there's any content that would be triggering. \n\nLooking at if from an instructor's perspective, if you can't read a book in the curriculum they wrote, they then have to take the time to find an alternative text, create an new assignment (sometimes with a different rubric), and a write a new assessment. If you've ever done any curriculum planning, you know this can take quite a bit of time. Just about everyone I've worked with would be happy to do that if a student came to them early on and respectfully explained their concerns (depending on the teacher &amp; how long they've taught that course, they might already have an alternative lined up). But I can imagine lot of teachers would be more reluctant to do this if it was done on short notice because that is potentially giving them a lot of extra work to do on a short notice. \n\nI often tell folks, educators can't accommodate for something they don't know about. Work with your instructor and explain your situation asap so they can know what it is you need",

How easy it is for a person to become desensitized to a situation which, in any normal course of event is horrific in nature. \n\nIt's easy to talk about morality and ethics when it doesn't cost you anything. When its a question of life and death, what would you do? Live up to your principles or give in?\n\nI've read a fair number of books but this is one book which had such an impact on my mental health that for the first time in my life I felt depressed. It took me a while to pick up another book by him. He's definitely my favourite author but idk if i will ever finish his Magnum Opus.",

            "comment": "It took me forever to finish Sartre's Les chemins de la libert\u00e9. I was super into it, but all the characters and their individual difficulties, it's almost too much. The depiction of lack of direction, disappointment, dissatisfaction, depression, in a very realistically everyday way - the fact that it is so undramatic makes it feel true. The central-ish character seems to manage to sabotage himself repeatedly, at the expense sometimes of other characters (what helps massively is he does get called out on it, brutally and hilariously. It is shown how such behaviour in response to depression can be gendered, I think. I was frustrated yet his perspective is depicted so well I still deeply cared what happened to him), and he's not the only one, while some characters are more a victim of circumstances and abuse. I think it's interesting partly because the dilemmas were sufficiently complex and realistic, I was sometimes torn myself and could imagine different readers night have very different responses (which helps the reader grasp Sartre's philosophy. And yep, that means no pat answers and solutions and being made to understand how that's reality, tough cookies). And then it's all overtaken by *flippin' WWII*. It would never have occurred to me (usually I don't like to read about wars) but the way to make a war book really effective is apparently to spend two books showing the characters' lives beforehand. In the last book, I slowed back down to a crawl at the prison camp section. The tension simply of not knowing when they'll be provided with food, the horribly accurate and vivid description of their state of starvation/blood sugar crash (I have major digestive issues so was already reading it feeling dizzy as a regular state. Sartre's writing has an incredible physicality to it) that make it clear Sartre knows what he's writing about, the tension as to whether the fledgling resistance will be discovered and as to how the characters are going to deal with the moral/political dilemmas. It felt real because it was, I think. But all of it is just so good, I'm not sure I've read anything that communicates the sense of lived experience so well, and does it for such a varied and large cast of characters as well.",

Like I understand that he's supposed to represent the individualist spirit rebelling against an oppressive system, but his actions and the book's overall attitude towards Ms. Ratched reads to me as so unintentionally sexist, that I would get angry reading it.\n\n I'm totally fine with books depicting sexist attitudes or I can even look past older classics that have not-so-progressive themes around gender. That being said, the entirety of OFOTCN is a series of power struggles between a convicted rapist (who we're supposed to root for) and a female nurse just doing her goddamn job. Again, I understand the events in the book are metaphorical for overall societal oppression &amp; free will and all that jazz, but so much of it read to me as men feeling emasculated because they are confronted with the horrific idea of a woman holding a position of authority over them.",

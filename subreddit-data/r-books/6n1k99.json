A word-forming element meaning \n1. \"after, behind,\" \n2. \"changed, altered,\" \n3. \"higher, beyond;\" from Greek meta (prep.) \"in the midst of; in common with; by means of; between; in pursuit or quest of; after, next after, behind,\" in compounds most often meaning \"change\" of place, condition, etc. This is from PIE *me- \"in the middle\" (source also of German mit, Gothic mi\u00fe, Old English mi\u00f0 \"with, together with, among;\" see mid). Notion of \"changing places with\" probably led to senses \"change of place, order, or nature,\" which was a principal meaning of the Greek word when used as a prefix (but also denoting \"community, participation; in common with; pursuing\"). \n\nThird sense, \"higher than, transcending, overarching, dealing with the most fundamental matters of,\" is due to misinterpretation of metaphysics as \"science of that which transcends the physical.\" This has led to a prodigious erroneous extension in modern usage, with meta- affixed to the names of other sciences and disciplines, especially in the academic jargon of literary criticism.",

He is standing on the back of another turtle.\" \"Oh, I see\", said Professor James, still being polite. \"But would you be so good as to tell me what holds up the second turtle?\" \"It's no use, Professor\", said the old lady, realizing he was trying to lead her into a logical trap. \"It's turtles-turtles-turtles, all the way!\u201d\n\n\u2014 from Wilson, R.A.

It\u2019s one of the great ancient myths, found wherever men and turtles were gathered together; the four elephants were an Indo-European sophistication. The idea has been lying in the lumber rooms of legend for centuries. All I had to do was grab it and run away before the alarms went off.",

There's also stuff like like [Seoul Station's Necromancer](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/seoul-stations-necromancer/) as an example of *dimensional warfare* levels of apocalypse. It's a Korean novel though.\n\nThere are plenty of novels in the West that don't pertain to this at all, but many popular ones, and ones that the average reader hooks into, are action and survival related stories. \n\nPersonally I'd prefer that more cute or romantic novels would be translated.",

From the article ([cached version](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20170713154226/http://bruce-humes.com/archives/1885)):\n&gt;If nothing else, the footnote reader will come away from Eclipse much more knowledgeable about Greek mythology and its pantheon of anthropomorphic deities, demi-gods and assorted flying creatures and evil-doers. One note begins with a reference to Medusa, but quickly moves onto Aegis, Amphitrite, Athena, Chrysaor, Pegasus, Perseus and Poseidon, all of whom are related in one way or the other to this gorgon on a (never-ending) bad-hair day.\n\n&gt;As for Americana, this is arguably the most intriguing category of the three. The subjects boggle the mind: References to and definitions of \u201ccheerios\u201d (the breakfast cereal) and \u201cpop-tarts\u201d (each measuring 7.6 x 14cm); \u201cslumber party\u201d (apparently only for girls); the Confederacy and General William Tecumseh Sherman; Xerox and the New Deal; and \u201cJohn Brown\u2019s Body\u201d.\n\nEDIT: As posted by /u/guanzhong, an [interview with translator of *Twilight*](https://www.facebook.com/WuxiaworldWebnovels/videos/189250658260178/)",

You could have sleepovers with cousins and close family, but never someone that wasn't family. I think it had a bit to do with fear of rape (which ironically happens a lot between family in Central America). I didn't really even have sleepovers with cousins because they are all older than me and they didn't leave nearby. To this day it's still very taboo to sleep over at someone else's house, and I'm in college.  \nIn CA family is much closer and they are always around, and this was especially true 15 years ago. My dad would go and stay with my aunt and his cousins for days with no problems. They were all friends, never with friends though. Culturally most of your friends are also family somehow. ",

                            "comment": "Hmm, if anyone's interested, there's a tonne of Chinese novels but there are common tropes that can be hard to swallow or just downright terrible. Most translated novels on the sub are what we call xianxia/wuxia which is a genre focused on ancient Chinese culture and martial arts mixed with supernatural powers such as cultivation of qi/inner powers set in the context of traditional Chinese history/setting. ELI5: Chinese version of magic\n\nThere are many of such stories, but only some are good or decent. Stereotypical scenarios such as character tropes, one-dimensional side-characters, cookie-cutter villains, or simply bad writing are very common. After all, most translations are of web novels where writers are paid per chapter so most tend to drag things out. Like really drag things out (**into hundreds or thousands of chapters**) which is very daunting to most beginners, and there's always cultural references or things that are lost in translation. I do recommend English novels though, most provide a higher quality of writing and some gems might be even better than published books. Highly recommend mother of learning and worm, they are my favourites. Whatever you do, if someone recommends you 'tales of demons and gods', slap him or her in the face, that series is the epitome of the problems I listed above and by far one of the worst reading experiences I have ever had that put me off from reading CN for a very long time.\n\nSome recommendations if you're interested (All free btw):\n\n**Chinese novels:**\n\n- Coiling dragon (completed: good place to start getting used to the genre. 806 chapters)\n\n- The divine elements (ongoing: Written by an english author, story is set in the Wuxia/Xianxia genre so common terms etc are easier to understand and it doesn't sacrifice quality either. 187 chapters and counting)\n\n- World of Cultivation (ongoing: 669 chapters)\n\n- A Will Eternal (ongoing: 68 chapters)\n\n*If you're looking you like the genre and are looking for something else to read - I shall seal the heavens (completed: definitely not for beginners, it has some good bits but towards the end, it falls into common tropes and the power creep is absurd. ~1.5k chapters)\n\n\n**Chinese that isn't xianxia**\n\n- Release that witch\n\n**English** (highly recommended):\n\n- **Mother of learning**: since this is one of my favourites, I'll talk in depth about it. What started as a way for the author to practice English has turned into something that's really special in my opinion. It's an original story that's a mix between harry potter and groundhog day; despite the groundhog day scenario, the story is kept fresh and interesting. There's a tangible feeling of development and growth for our main character that's natural and engaging, magic is explored through our MC, Zorian. With each cycle, Zorian learns more about himself, others, his own abilities and weaknesses, and how to allocate his skills and abilities into areas that can provide the most benefit given his limitations (/r/rational plug). With each repetition, Zorian grows not only as a person but as a mage as well, after all, repetition is the mother of learning.\n\n- **Worm**: A twist to the superhero genre told from the perspective of Taylor who aspires to become a superhero but strays from that path after a chance meeting. \n\n- **Twig**: same author as worm but not related, hard to pinpoint what genre it is. Some call it biopunk and I sort of agree but whatever the case, I think writing wise, it's of higher quality",

At the end of the glossary, they also explained go honorifics are used in japanese society and how grow characters in a very close relationship may not even use an honorific as a from of endearment. \n\nIt really brings a level of depth to the story when you see a character progress from calling someone \u201c-san\u201d, to \u201c-kun\u201d to \u201c-chan\u201d (context dependant), to finally leaving the honorific off entirely. \n\nAnd that often gets lost when an English translation decides to drop honorifics and, suddenly, the main protagonist blushes when their love interest says \u201cGoodbye, Haseo\u201d, when in japanese there was a crucial interaction that changed \u201cHaseo-san\u201d to \u201cHaseo-kun\u201d.\n\nOr, when a character asks another to refer to them exclusively by their first name, something which seems normal to most Americans, but typically only happens between friends/family/lovers (at the time I remember reading that footnote).",

It really helps set the background for people who aren't at all familiar with Japanese culture.

For example, I'm watching Death Note for the first time and Misa refers to Light as \"darling\" shortly after meeting him. He responds, \"Did you just call me darling?\"\n\nReally, it's a pretty good translation culturally, not just linguistically. In the Japanese, she calls him \"Light\" and he asks, \"You're calling me by my first name already?\"\n\nJust a really cool, tiny detail that most people don't catch or care about. I regret that I didn't keep studying Japanese, or I'd probably catch more of these things.\n\n",

Because that's another thing that annoys me about translations. Sometimes they leave Japanese names in the normal order for Japan, other times they flip it around so that the given name is first like in English, and there's no consistency from one translation to another, to the extent that there's no possible way for the reader to know which system is being used until someone introduces a family member who shares their family name.",

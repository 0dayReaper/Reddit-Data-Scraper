I\u2019m not usually a sci-fi or an audiobook person but I am BURNING through this book. The vocal performance is hilarious and so talented, and the story itself just keeps you gripped from chapter to chapter.  I will say nothing more other than if you are like me, I urge you to give this book a shot!\n\nPeace.",

The audio quality itself is poor due to a lackluster production company (mouth sounds, poor editing.etc). Marsters was new to audiobooks, and while he's a talented actor, he still needed a bit of practice to apply his skills to the medium.\n\nOnce you get to Book 4 (Summer Knight), it's  a new audio production company with vastly improved quality , and Marsters  is nailing it.",

Not to mention his attention and your attention were being spread very thin by that point. He built the world, the rules, the cast, and it grew so incredibly large that he could start stretching the idea to it's more adventurous roots. The fourth book was a good example of that, he took the world he built and wrote a standalone book that existed in the bobiverse. All while still expanding on the rules of the bobiverse in the b and c plots.\n\nShort version, I loved all 4 books and appreciated that after the exponential growth and intense world building of the first three books he narrowed the viewport of the 4th book. I am eagerly awaiting the 5th book to see what he does next.",

                    "comment": "Yeah, the book isn\u2019t great. Main character is a complete Mary sue that has no logical reason to even be in the story at all. The book is marketed as hard sci-fi, but is much closer to fantasy sci-fin with \u201cscience\u201d bordering on magic and characters that have no logical reason to be where they are or capable of the things they do. The Martian was so successful because it was hard science fiction with a believable main character and a plot that was believable in our world, project Hail Mary rides off that reputation while being a completely different book with much less believable or well developed characters.\n\nThe Martian is about someone who was already a trained austronaut and biologist conducting experiments in space that encountered an emergency and had to expand upon their original (true to earth science) research to survive. Project Hail Mary is about a guy that wrote a theoretical paper that was debated in the scientific community, therefore he is a super genius and we should send him to space to save humanity because he believes in aliens and he\u2019s just That Guy Bro.\n\nThe Martian is a smart plot about a smart protagonist that makes good choices, Project Hail Mary is a stupid book about stupid characters that make stupid choices but try really hard to convince everyone around them all the time that they\u2019re actually really really super duper smart.",

You have to suspend disbelief and keep yourself from asking any logic questions (like, why does writing a research paper qualify you to be an astronaut, why does writing a single paper make you the leading expert in a field you\u2019re not actively doing research in, why does one individual have say over the entire fate of the planet for seemingly no reason? This is like chapter 1)\n\nThis book would not have been NEARLY as successful if it didn\u2019t mismarket itself and ride heavily off the coattails of The Martian. It is a fantastic audio performance tho.",

There are a *crazy* amount of characters and he manages to make them all feel separate and unique.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit technological.  But the physics aspects are such that anyone with a bit a scientific knowledge could understand.\n\nThey are without a doubt some of my favorite books.  Can\u2019t wait to finish this one!",

Normally I listen while doing things. But this one I just sat and listened to long into the night. Fantastic book, fantastic audio.",

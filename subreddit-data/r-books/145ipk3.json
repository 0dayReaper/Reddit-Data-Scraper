    "postText": "So I read a story called \"Rant of the Broken Heart: Ghosted\" by E.A. Cole on kindle. It was short but it was packed full of emotion, and I could almost feel the agony that the author felt. There is no dialogue it's just the author going a little crazy from being ghosted. Does it really matter how long a story is as long as it gets what you want the reader to think and feel what you intend? I guess I would rather have a short powerful story than a long okayish story. Anyone else?",

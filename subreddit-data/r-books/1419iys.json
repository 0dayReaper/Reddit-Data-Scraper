It only come\u2019s out the bag to read so I\u2019m confused when I see all the marks on the edges. \n\nI was wonder how everyone else protects their books and what I could do to make sure the next book I read doesn\u2019t get ruined.",

I've seen book sleeves online that are a very similar idea. If you have any basic sewing skills, you could definitely make one - it would probably be significantly cheaper",

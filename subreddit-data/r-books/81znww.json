It's one author a year and they are contributing a \"text\" which they seal in a box, so it's not clear if each author had donated a novel, novella or short story, etc. And we'll probably never find out.\n\nThey also planted a forest which will be used to make paper to print the books next century, and a small room in a public library where they will be stored (unopened and inaccessible).\n\nAlso, it seems unlikely 100 authors really have pledged to participate, as the ones writing in 2110 are unlikely to be alive now.",

Since A Dance with Dragons he's edited tons of anthology and Wild Card books, wrote an episode per season in the earlier seasons of Game of Thrones, bought and runs his own small movie theater, a wolf sanctuary, landlord to the huge art-collective Meow Wolf, and now helping start a local movie/TV studio. And he's worked on his GRRMarrillion to the point that the first half is almost done.... So he definitely still enjoys writing and working, just not on the one thing that everyone wants him to be working on. ",

I could read The Count of Monte Cristo and it doesn't matter whether Dumas officially published it in the 1800s or in 2018, it's a great book. All he would have done if he had some magical ability to release it now is deprive people of an amazing story from the 1800s up until now. Occasionally I will stumble upon niche authors and read their stuff and they're long gone, I think that's very cool, that their stuff still bleeds through time.\n\nIf anything, the only debatably unique thing it offers is a book that cannot be directly discussed with the writer, but lots of writers such as Kafka had their stuff published after they died.\n\n",

From a scholarship perspective it would be fascinating as a writer or literature enthusiast to read a work by a known author for which there is no preceding criticism. It's the closest way to getting to see the last century's art with fresh eyes.\n\nI acknowledge your examples are true. I'd like to propose a counterexample, from my area of expertise. You mentioned Mozart, which leads perfectly into my point; Johann Sebastian Bach was primarily a church musician who developed a regional following during his lifetime. After his death his music, representing the full flowering of Baroque German music, disappeared; by his creative peak baroque music had already been abandoned as the trendy style in favor of the first classical composers. Until Mozart. Mozart discovers the work of Bach and is famous for saying he'd rather see an organ concert of Bach than hear the music of his contemporaries. As a result, a composer that time forgot was presented anew a centuryish later, and resonated, and is now thought of as a GOAT.\n\nEdited because I'm on mobile and it's hard to proofread ",

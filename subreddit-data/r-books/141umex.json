    "postText": "\nThe book initially starts with a retelling of what happened in the year of 1974. It details each of the major players and their preparations for their voyage to the remote atoll, Palmyra. It further details their interactions with friends and family prior to setting sail. It lastly deals with the events of Palmyra, leading up to and ending with a grisly murder.   \n\nIt is obvious from the beginning that something dark and terrible is set to happen and the book never let's up a certain sense of tension that proceeds throughout the entire novel. In fact, I felt a sickly knot in my stomach while reading that has yet to leave me even after finishing. There are many questions left unanswered the full truth will almost certainly never be known.   \n\nThe second half of the book deals with the legal details and ensuing trials. While often, legal matters can be extremely boring, the book made them interesting and I never felt like I was slogging through words and terms that I couldn't understand. This section of the book is marked with footnotes and references to deepen the understanding of the reader. Mr. Bugliosi is an expert in including the most interesting and important details while keeping in tact the integrity of the subject matter. Few cases, even the most interesting ones, would have been as evocative to read by a different author.   \n\nMr. Bugliosi distills down the facts of the case and proceeding lawsuits with a succinct and gentle hand. One feels as though they were there in the courtroom as he writes. While the general story line is deeply compelling, more interesting is the way he is able to explain deeply complicated legal ideas into a delightfully digestible format. It does not take a lawyer or any such person thus versed to appreciate the legal strategy set forth in these pages.   \n\nI could continue to sing the praises of this book for quite some time but suffice to say that it was interesting, well written and extremely thorough in delving into its subject matter. As a person who reads almost exclusively fantasy, I would reccommend this book many times over to anyone. I do not believe that many would find cause for distate with this book and for well over 600 pages, I was totally riveted and reticent to put it down for even a moment.  \n\n\nI am exceptionally eager to pick up his other books now and would love your opinions if you have read them!",

They matched perfectly. It was like finding a secret trawl of footnotes that expanded upon the original in a really amazing way. I would recommend both books btw.",

I tossed out or donated half of my possessions on a minimalist-kick, but I still kept that book, which I bought in my teens.\n\nSpoiler for the ending, &gt;!Jenkins (real name Stearns) was lucky to have Bugliosi. I've read lots of lawyer's quotes to the effect of 25% of a verdict is the lawyer and 75% is the facts or that most cases win themselves and the rest are lost by the lawyer, and so on, but it's hard for me to have read that book and not think Bugliosi won a borderline case due to his meticulous skill.!&lt;\n\nYou might also like his *Till Death Do Us Part*, about his most famous murder case before the Charles Manson killings. It goes deep into trial tactics and includes most of his actual summation. Which is brilliant to read. And is a book I also own.\n\nThe only problem I have with it, is that I feel that this is the book where his ego started to go crazy. I didn't get that sense from *Helter Skelter. Till Death Do Us Part* had a little of it. *Outrage,* another excellent book, could also have been titled, *Why Everyone Not Me* *Is an Idiot.* After that, all of his books are cringe ego-trips, save the JFK ones.\n\nIn *And The Sea Will Tell,* you can rest assured that he is the greatest advocate to ever advocate. He puts in his entire summation; his co-counsel's opening statement gets, IIRC, less than a paragraph.",

The evidence was shaky at best and honestly, until the end not even I wasn't sure what the outcome would be. The facts of the case were wild and ever shifting. It kept me on my toes until the very end.   \n\nHe does seem to like the smell of his own facts. On the other hand, it does seem as though his tactics were effective. Perhaps some amount of ego is well deserved.   \n\nThanks again for your recommendations!",

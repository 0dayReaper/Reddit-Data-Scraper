But it's fucked.  \n\nHow did a book that apparently kickstarted the horror genre not be a horror book but one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever read.  \n\nIt is a tradegy on all sides.  The two main characters have reasons of acting the way they did.  \n\nI'm trying not to spoil too much (even though the book is over 200 years old) \n\nFor anyone who want a short read (my copy was 143 pages but was a wider print.  Good reads has it at like 215).  I highly suggest this book. \n\nIt's not scary but it is fucked  5/5 \n\nNext book:  the trial by Franz Kafka",

From Phantom of the Opera to Dracula to Frankenstein, they separated from the book counterparts fairly quickly and cemented the cultural depictions for decades afterwards. That said, recent movements in pop culture have slowly changed that. In the 90's, there were more book accurate adaptations of Frankenstein and Dracula (admittedly, they weren't fully accurate, but they did include more from the books than previous versions) and Phantom of the Opera had the pop culture image permanently changed through the musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber",

It's probably one of the only approaches that manages to do justice to the monster of the novel despite his story being a sub-narrative in the show. Also in Penny Dreadful you really get to experience Victor Frankenstein for the delusional egomaniac that he is.",

In 1831, the more traditionally first \"popular\" edition in one volume appeared. This version of the story was heavily revised by Mary Shelley who was under pressure to make the story more conservative, and included a new, longer preface by her, presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This edition tends to be the one most widely read now but many scholars prefer the 1818 text, arguing that it preserves the spirit of Shelley's original publication.\"",

    "postText": "I am wondering what everyone thought of the structure of this book. I was not a fan. It felt like it wandered a lot. There seemed to be interesting nuggets here and there, but it didn\u2019t develop into a nonfiction story as much as it was a bunch of related podcasts(I listened to the book). I am interested in native history and present day news; this book was just a slog.",

            "comment": "I really enjoyed it and the whole thing flew by for me. I think it's worth noting that Grann had to do a lot of the research on individuals did not always have a lot of records on them. Like I would have loved to know more about Molly Burkhart's thoughts throughout the investigation and trial, but they weren't documented. I think Grann had to do more wandering with the subject because some topics/people/events had more records than others",

It could have easily been 3 separate books (1: Molly Burkhart &amp; family, 2: White/Hoover, 3: Osage history).  Where the book made it challenging to read was the lack of fluid transitions between these topics.  Again - good content and I appreciate how much I learned but I agree with the issues you posted.",

The first six or seven chapters are everything one could want to know about the Osage... which is interesting, I guess, but it definitely wasn't what I was looking for.\n\nPut it down when I realized it probably wasn't going to pan out.\n\nReally looking forward to the movie though.",

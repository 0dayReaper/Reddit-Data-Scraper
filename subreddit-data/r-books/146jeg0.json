    "postText": "*Note: DNF stands for Did Not Finish. To DNF is generally to make the choice to not finish a book*\n\nSo it's one thing to DNF a bad book, a book you're hating reading. I fully endorse not finishing books you're really not enjoying. BUT what about mediocre books? Books that you are fairly certain will not be a new favourite, probably won't get more than a 3 star rating? Books you aren't struggling through but are \"just okay\"?\n\nI've been struggling with whether or not to DNF these books. I've been reading a lot of \"just fine\" not great or terrible books lately and I can only DNF so many before it gets depressing. Trying to debate with myself whether these books are truly worth my time is getting exhausting.\n\nSo what are y'all's philosophies or strategies in regards to mediocre books? If like me you're on a massive DNF streak, does/would that impact your choice to DNF a book?\n\nWould love to see some discussion around this topic because most discussion around DNFing is about bad books (though bad is in the eye of the beholder) and not just meh ones.",

If I find myself hitting the point of annoyance at how mediocre a book is, it's either worth continuing from a writer's PoV to dissect the problem or to just DNF and find something better.\n\nWhen I'm in a DNF streak, I tend to view it as a result of being in a dour mood or a rut where I desperately want something new, or that the source that I'm using for recs is not a good fit. At that point, it's worth trying out a new genre or old classic you've heard about but haven't read yet. If nothing else, it might help you realize what you're really itching to read!",

If I started a chunkier book (600+ pages) and thought it was mediocre then maybe I would DNF, because that\u2019s a lot more time wasted if I don\u2019t like it.

    "postText": "Uncultured swine post incoming.\n\nI read that Jane Austen was a witty author and that Northanger Abbey is her funniest novel. A satire of a gothic novel seemed like an interesting premise to me.\n\nThe problem is, I'm one third through the book and so far it has been mind-numbingly repetitive. The main character goes to socialize with a bunch of people, having boring conversations with them (so tedious that the author often just sums them up instead of writing them out). Same environments, same people, rinse and repeat. Nothing happens in the first third of this novel. If I read the word \"pump room\" one more time, I will... insert hyperbole here.\n\nCan people who do enjoy this book, or Jane Austen in general, tell me what they enjoy about it?",

            "comment": "This is your first Austen, right? If so, I'd recommend you read another first. Pride and Prejudice would be a good choice.\n\nThe thing with Northanger is it's a parody of a number of older Gothic classics - Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, Charlotte Lennox's The Female Quixote, among others, so a lot of the humour comes from those comparisons. And so you've also got to like books about books, a lot.\n\nThis all said, there's not too much action, per se, in Austen, and a lot of the drama comes from dialogue and social situations. People do walk around pump rooms (sorry to repeat it!) and 'take a turn about the room' (same thing, really), and generally sit around and talk over tea. You might find the Brontes or Dickens more to your taste. Perhaps Hardy or Oscar Wilde.",

There are also lots of cultural references to writers of the time, like ones saying it's scandalous for a girl to fall in love first. Ellie Dashwood is a good YouTube channel to learn about them",

There are countless reviews about Northanger Abbey and Jane Austen that describe in great detail why people like it. \n\nMaybe it's just not a good match for you and what you look for in a book? Books are like food: not everyone likes the same stuff. Doesn't mean that you're \"missing\" anything or that there's anything wrong with you, it just means other people are looking for or enjoy something different than you do.",

I feel like it's probably not engaging if you haven't all the Gothic silliness it's based on.",

Whether you like 18th/19th gothic lit and romance is definitely a determining factor in whether you'll enjoy Northanger Abbey, find it funny, and in what you consider \"action\" imo. \n\nPersonally, I loved Northanger Abbey, was glued to the page the whole way through and found it absolutely hilarious. But I'm also a big fan of classic gothic lit (Mysteries of Udolpho is one of my favourite books), which is what Austen was playing off.",

The dialogue is wittier and the characters are amusing across the board. That being said, Austen's writing takes a little getting used to. I missed a lot of her dry, snarky remarks the first time I read P&amp;P",

            "comment": "For me Jane Austen's novels have a lightheartedness to them that makes them really enjoyable to read. I love her dry humour and the funny, sometimes exaggerated characters she created.\n\nNorthanger Abbey only starts being a satire of a gothic novel in the second volume of the book, in the first volume we only see the daily life of our characters and we get to know them and the relationships between them better.\n\nI personally love Jane Austen and everything that I've read from her, but I also just love classics in general, so I think I love the things you dislike just because they are my cup of tea. I enjoy the verbose prose, the conversations, the way people used to talk, and the character driven books that don't really have any action. To me, classics always have something deep to say - they are great character studies and they portray social commentaries that I find intriguing. Maybe these things are not for you and that's why you don't find the book enjoyable, or if you enjoy other classics maybe this is just not the right book for you.",

It is also not a parody.\n\nHaving said the above, I love the novel.\n\nThe book is written from the perspective of a very na\u00efve and inexperienced young woman. The comedy is that the author slyly blends her own insights with those of the protagonists, and the fun is that we see her make mistake after mistake.\n\nThe author and the audience understand that Isabella is always scheming, long before Catherine has an inkling. And before Catharine fully understands how she feels about Tilney, the audience know that he's a suitable romantic interest.\n\nThe fact that Catharine makes so many mistakes out of ignorance makes her very relatable. As does her occasional disappointment with Bath.\n\nThe repetition and the triviality of the social activities contrast with the fact that this is a great adventure to the inexperienced Catherine and the Gothic novels she loves so much.\n\nAs for the Gothic element, the joke is that Catharine confuses the ingredients of her favorite genre with real life.\n\nAusten isn't satirizing or parodying the genre, she's making fun of a young person who is engrossed by fiction and who has little life experience.\n\nIt's good-natured fun of course.",

Sometimes the humour doesn\u2019t come across if you aren\u2019t used to it or don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for, so a talented reader can really help with a wry tone. Emma Thompson has done Northanger Abbey and it\u2019s fantastic",

If it's your first time reading Austen though, I recommend you read Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility first so you get a bit used to her writing before Northanger Abbbey, NA is one of my fav books though so I really hop you do end up enjoying it eventually.I really love Catherine's naive personality and how funny she can be at times and Henry Tilney is just an amazing character in general, Eleanor and General Tilney are also great characters in general, I laughed quite a bit at General Tilneys strictness for time and Eleanor and Catherine's great friendship, so keep reading because the second half of the book is where its at.",

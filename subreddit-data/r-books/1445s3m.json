There was a scene where he went to her drunk but I thought he left without doing anything because of his love for Remedios. I am drawing a family tree as I read to keep up with the story and this kind of stumped me and feels weird to move along without clearing it. !&lt;",

I want to love his books because his writing and characters are so gorgeous and skilled.\n\nBut that ending in Love in the Time of Cholera just killed him for me. I understand freedom of expression and art but I feel he normalizes sexual abuse and pedophilia in his writings in a way I simply can\u2019t come to terms with. Say it\u2019s symbolism all you want, I think it\u2019s just normalizing horrific abuse.",

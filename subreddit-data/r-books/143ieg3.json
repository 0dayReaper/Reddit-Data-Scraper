    "postText": "For example, I just finished \"This Place of Wonder\" by Barbara O'Neal.  It's a decent read, above average.  I think I'd give it like a 7/10.  But more than anything, the thing that stuck with me, over any part of the plot or characters, was this one random line.  \n\nI don't want to spoil too much, but the premise of the book is that the patriarch of a family has died, and it's not clear if it was natural or not.  Some of the main characters are in the kitchen discussing it when a police officer knocks at their door.  He has some routine questions.  They have a short conversation, and at the end she wrote that the officer \"saluted\" the women before leaving the question.\n\nThat is just such a bizarre thing to include. Police officers investigating a potential murder don't salute civilians.  It's laughable trying to even imagine it.  It just indicates to me that she doesn't really know anything about how cops behave.  Just shows a complete lack of research and a really strange way of viewing police interaction.  \n\nIt's become the main thing I associate with this book and I can't help it.  It just struck me as utterly ridiculous when I read it.\n\nEdit: so the actual line is *\u201c\u2018All right, thank you.\u2019 He stands, salutes us, and walks out.\u201d*  I\u2019ll accept that the word salute can mean any respectful gesture, but in this context I\u2019d bet 9 out of 10 people would picture a formal salute. He is described earlier as being a plain clothes detective. It\u2019s weird.  It wouldn\u2019t happen.",

It's against the law in MN to turn off the heat in the winter if someone doesn't pay their bill. It's a stupid thing that only someone who lives in MN like I do would know, but it was very obvious the author just picked a state they knew had winters and didn't do any research.",

Stuff like that happens in the book \"Nightlight\" but it's a parody and that sort of stuff happens on purpose to be funny (like the love interest's eye and hair color is different every time it's mentioned).",

It was Paul McCartney alone who wrote it, John just gets credited as well because they had an agreement to put their names together on everything they wrote for the band. \n\nMaybe I just know too much about Beatles history, but that seems very googleable.",

Chess and checkers are very different and Russia is known for producing chess players. How do you even make a mistake like that?\n\nAlso, a friend of mine read a book (I can't remember the title) where a person made a business feeding chickens quotes on paper and the quotes would then be written on the eggs they laid. It's all I can remember that she told me because that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.",

The correct thing to do is assume that every knife is long enough to go through the patient and you assess them and choose imaging studies or exploration based on that fact. Victims rarely see the knife that stabbed them, and when they do, they are generally so agitated that their answers are meaningless. Ask them how long the knife was is useless at best  and at worst could lead you astray.

You're completely smooth after a wax. You don't start itching until the hair starts growing in, and that takes about two weeks. It took me out of the story and made me think about how the writer of the novel has clearly never gotten her pubic area waxed.",

The two that really linger in the memory are (1) our heroine's alcoholic father getting a normal job in a bar in the US. In the mid 1920s. See what's wrong with this picture? Apparently neither the author nor any editor did. (2) In one of the foster homes the protagonist stays in, right around the time of the 1929 stock market crash, the foster mother keeps all the food locked in the refrigerator to keep the foster children from getting into it. Does that happen now? Sure does. Could it happen in 1929? Sure, if you had almost no food in the house. Iceboxes were small and had a large chunk of their space taken up by, you guessed it, ice. There were larger electric refrigerators but they cost an absolute fortune -- and if that's what the character had, the plot point where a few months later she kills herself because she's broke and doesn't want to deal with being poor doesn't make much sense. Hey, lady, before you walk into a blizzard, why not see about trying to sell the goddamn electric-powered goldmine in your kitchen? Seriously, the whole novel read like someone who'd skimmed a couple of Wikipedia entries for the pre-war period at the absolute best.",

Some people and place names in the book are obviously Spanish-inspired and I know a bit of Spanish (not perfect, but still). One beach was called \"Del Ojos Beach,\" which translates literally to \"Of the Eyes Beach.\" It would have made way more sense to call it \"Beach del Ojos\" or even just \"Ojos Beach.\" It's just so awkward and clunky. It makes me feel like she just put it into Google Translate really quick and popped it into her story without thinking about it.",

Doesn't seem unheard of.\n\nSome youtubers I watch will start off their videos with a little salute every time too, and they're talking about video games.\n\nHell even like Jpop singers I listened to back in the 90s would give a little salute to people.\n\nThen again I don't know how it was portrayed in that book, and not including it even if it isn't unheard of would avoid it seeming weird to the reader I guess",

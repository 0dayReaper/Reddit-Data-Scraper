All the book we lend via Overdrive are tallied up and count towards our lending statistics, so feel free to use it as much as possible!!",

Books are split into lots of categories (paperback, hardback, audiobook, large print, dyslexia friendly, e-book), and it's important we know which categories are more popular so we can invest shelf space and purchasing power to those categories. Also, different libraries in the city definitely have different demographics, with older audiences predominantly reading thrillers/crime novels, and the younger generation a more eclectic mix of fantasy, non-fiction and the like. Libraries in areas with more families (usually those near schools) lend a lot more children's books, so that needs to be taken into account. Also the overall lending figures give us clout when we ask for funding, as the more books that get borrowed, the more activities and events people attend and the more facilities are used, the more justification we have in asking for more moolah!\n\nIt's obviously a bit more in-depth than that when you look at it as a whole, but that's the general gist of it all.

If everyone did that it would lead us to believe (based on statistics) that our readers are shifting towards e-books. We then invest more into e-book licenses over paper copies, leaving our paperback readers wanting while not giving anything to the e-book market as the new investment was based on a false positive. \n\nYou're far better off to use it as you want to. See a book you like? Give it a borrow. False borrowing, while it looks good on paper in the short term, makes it hard for us to track trends and invest properly. ",

That's the age of people who are having kids right now and those parents are probably going to the library to get their kids a children's book. I feel like that's going to really drive up the numbers for millennials. \n\nAlso, I wonder how libraries at public universities are handled. Are those considered public libraries in this study? Because if they are, then that is also going to drive up the numbers for millennials. \n\nI also think there is some lying going on here by these survey respondents. 46% of people say they visited a public library in the past 12 months? Does anyone here buy that? I sure don't. ",

Smart phones were not part of my formative years. The only social media anybody from my graduating classes use are FB and Twitter, with a few especially vain girls using instagram. \n\nFor a lot of us we already had a codified worldview and set of beliefs before 9/11 changed the world. \n\nThere is a huge difference between 80s millennials and 90s millennials. I suspect 80s millennials are going to end up a forgotten generation in a sense, because for one thing 90s millennials are an overpowering presence digitally and we get lost in the wash, and because the world that we were prepared for doesn't exist, blown away by 9/11, the smart phone, the great recession, and the current global political state. These were all massive black Swan events that happened out of nowhere and forever took away the world that we were raised to operate in.",

There are also cool events such as lectures and classes/tutorials on different topics. On top of that, some of the libraries in my city are absolutely beautiful spaces and a nice change from reading or doing work at a cafe.\n\nI also just don't like buying books.

None of the branches loan video games. The library system the next town over has one location of 4 in their system that loans Wii and 360 games. Other then that I don't know of any other library system in my general area that loans games. Yet none of them have color printing. Everything you print or even make copies of is still black and white. Yet some libraries offer color laser printing. ",

So he's walking into the \"kitchen / living room\" with a mouth full of toothpaste brushing his teeth waiting on his wife to finish getting into the closet. \n\nThey're dumb and I wish they would do a tiny home \"where are they now.\" I'm betting you 90% move out after five years.

Most public universities have their own public libraries and sometimes you end up there just to study or just have a place to go if you can't go home.\n\nOn top of that, minors (Gen Z?) aren't mentioned here, without a doubt there's more of them going to libraries more than Millennials.   From age 4 or 5 to 18, you're a student and have to go a library whether you like it or not. Although their (school) libraries might not be considered public.",

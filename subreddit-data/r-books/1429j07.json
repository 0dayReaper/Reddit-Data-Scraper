Or a website which lists soon available languages?\r  \nMy parents, particularly my mother, aren't living very healthy livestyles. Where as my father began to move more and eat better, my mother is still on the same obesity level as some years ago. As the problem with many older folks she is very stubborn and doesn't like to do things if even one little detail is off. That's why I want that book in her mother- tongue.\r  \nI would like to try the non-confrontational way of a book to plant the idea of a healthier life in her (instead of begging her to please move more and eat less and better)\r  \nThank you!",

Whether I am at work during downtime or at home with any free time, I struggle to stay focused. \n\nI do eventually return to read another chapter or two, but find myself getting exhausted or bored no matter the book. My wife can read for hours on end and get lost in her books entirely, something I envy. \n\nDid you ever encounter this problem? What strategies did you use to become a more avid reader?",

                    "comment": "There are a litany of reasons why someone might struggling to focus on reading. But in my experience talking with many readers who feel as you do, one especially common issue is a shorted attention span. Many of the joys of reading are not immediate returns on time invested and there is no shortage of novelty which gives more tangible endorphin drips. The answer for a lot of people is a combination of discipline, decreasing friction, and increasing reward incentive. Set times for yourself where you read for half an hour a day and stick with it. Then for longer periods when that becomes effortless. Put your phone or technology in another room when you read. Choose pulpy books to start which get into the meat of action early and keep you page turning. Some people have found that listening along to an audiobook as you visually read helps them stay focused. Read along with other people whether they be r/book_buddies or a r/bookclub because having a social component to the experience adds accountability, provides the pleasure of connecting through a group experience, and allows you to explore new perspectives in engaging with literature which may open up new joys in how you relate to the art.",

Try setting one for 10 or 15 minutes, and once that gets easy add another 5 until you get to however long you want to read for. \n\nMake sure you don't have access to any electronics/the Internet while you read, and cutting back on time spent on electronics and social media can help improve attention span in general. \n\nReading at or around the same time every day can also help train your brain.",

Is this by design or is it a printing error?**\n\nRight in the middle of Chapter 17, page 66 is replaced with a second copy of page 34. And then page 71 is replaced with a copy of page 39. There are like 3-4 others after that, but it stops by about page 100.\r  \n\r  \nAt first I thought this was an homage to Burrogh's \"cut up\" technique, but now I'm thinking it's just an error.

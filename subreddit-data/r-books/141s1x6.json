    "postText": "Wow, I was loaned this Diary about 3 men starving to death in the Canadian wilderness.\n\nIt's not a story, it's not based on a true story.  It's the actual found diary of a young man who starved to death in 1927. It's the day to day account, over the course of 8 months or so, of the struggle to survive through a tough sub-arctic winter basically locked in a cabin and cut off from the rest of humanity.\n\nThe calmness and matter of factness with which it is written is unbelievable.  The introduction includes the various hopeful letters the young Edgar sends back to his folks in England, the conclusion includes the RCMP report of finding the bodies and of finding the Diary in the wood stove.\n\nI was looking on Amazon to buy a copy for myself, however it appears to be rare and costly, in the $200 range.  Anyone else read this book?",

            "comment": "These guys were trapping fox, wolverines, ferrets etc.  In the end, out of desperation, they ended up scavenging through their months old \"gut pile\". Eating anything they could find. Including blood,bones and the skins they had intended to sell. Obviously, constipation became a huge problem for them. Edgar, very plainly describes how the days passed by.  Mostly weather reports, what animals they were able to trap and what they were able to eat. It's amazing how tough humans can be(like animals) when they have no choice. Edgar lasted about a month longer than the other 2 so he was totally alone that whole time. It's one of those, truth is stranger than fiction stories.",

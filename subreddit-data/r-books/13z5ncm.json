    "postText": "Hello beautiful creatures! \n\nI\u2019ve really recently started reading Persuasion by Jane Austen cause I wanted to get into the classics era. I also love series and movies with background like Austen\u2019s books.\n\nBut I found out classics are another story. I find it so difficult to go through them, firstly I\u2019d say because of the language as English is not my native language. Yet I love the long sentences and all. \n\nSince I truly want to experience classics is there any advice you would give me? Or just your opinion?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "If you really struggle you could read them in your native language so you can enjoy the story instead of trying to understand the language. Depending on your English level maybe you could start with other genres like mystery/thrillers/romance or whatever you like, and when you become used to reading in English you can start reading classics as well.\n\nIf the struggle is not that bad and you get the gist of the story, try to push through and you will eventually become used to the writing style. When I read my first Jane Austen in English I found it difficult in the beginning, but the more I read the easier it bacame. Also, the more books you read in English the easier it will be to understand and enjoy them. At some point the language starts becoming familiar to you and you will not struggle that much. It also helps to accept the fact that you will read slower in English as opposed to your native language, which sometimes can become frustrating, but it's only natural.\n\nSo basically, fake it till you make it would be the best advice \ud83d\ude05 I hope this helps you in some way.",

Your English is clearly excellent, as per your post, so perhaps start with a novel from the 1930's (a Nevil Shute - well-written, but not a 'classic' - say, *An Old Captivity*)\n\nThen one from the 1920's, the Father Brown detective stories by G K Chesterton, certainly an excellent writer and very entertaining.\n\nThen something pre-war - Edgar Wallace, perhaps *Red Aces* or *The Mind of Mr Reeder*.\n\nWhich brings us to late Victorian and the Sherlock Holmes stores by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  By now you'll begin to notice the language has changed - more verbose, more decorative and with sometimes difficult references to then current events and customs.\n\nThen try a Thomas Hardy, *Tess of the D'Urbervilles* is a good one, then an easy Charles Dickens - *Pickwick Papers* say, and by then you should be attuned to the thinking of Miss Austen and will have read some damn fine books along the way.",

You\u2019ll get used to different syntax, idioms and word meanings, the more you read them.\n\nI don\u2019t think you need to work back, via more recent/easier classics. If you want to read Jane Austen in particular, start there! Let your enthusiasm and enjoyment carry you through any frustrating bits. Her stories are wonderful and you might want to think of it a bit like sci-fi, in that the world and customs are pretty alien but the people themselves are very much like us.\n\nI\u2019d also say it\u2019s not worth getting hung up on every little thing you don\u2019t understand. If you see a word you don\u2019t recognise but the context indicates it\u2019s an article of clothing, for example, you don\u2019t really need to know more than that to enjoy the story. Look it up later, if it reappears or the fancy takes you. You can always reread the books once you\u2019ve acquired more of that background information, and enjoy them in a new way.",

Same author and a great way to be introduced to Jane Austen.\n\nThere are a bunch of classics that are fairly easy to read. Although Austen writes very 'modern', Persuasion is arguably a bit more difficult to follow and Austen's books are complex because they are multilayered and use free indirect discourse and irony.\n\nOther than that, just stick with it. It becomes much easier quickly.\n\nYou will develop an instinctive understanding of the language after a few chapters.",

From my own experience, it wasn't until the 2nd time I read the book (after I learned more about Gothic literature and how Austen was satirizing it) that I ended up enjoying it. If I had to recommend one Austen book to a newcomer I'd for sure go with *Pride and Prejudice* (it is the basic answer, but it's basic for a reason: it's good)\n\nMy thing is, I think if you didn't like *Northanger Abbey*, or *Persuasion*, or *Mansfield Park*, etc. there's still a good chance you'd like one of Austen's other books (all of those books are either referencing other literary movements of her day, have some antiquated story elements/characterizations, or something that could be off-putting to a modern reader). That being said, if a person don't like *Pride and Prejudice*, I can't see them enjoying any of her other stuff. It's probably to most modern with its story (I mean it more or less birthed the romcom as we know it) it has colorful/memorable characters, it has clever writing, etc. I think the worst you could say is that it's overrated, but again, it's so highly rated in the first place because it is legitimately good",

            "comment": "As crazy as this sounds, I'd actually start with Shakespeare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first reason I say this is because there are several **phenomenal** adaptations that you can watch as you read. I know The BBC, PBS, and several other companies have the adaptations on DVD. However, I think several of them you can also rent/find on YouTube or other online sources. Shakespeare is as much an auditory and visual experience as it is a \"reading\" experience.  So, you can follow along in the book as you watch which will help you to not only understand the meaning of what you're reading but also to get a feel for English poetry and prose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second reason I'd say to start with Shakespeare is because Elizabethan English (Early Modern English) is the foundation for the \"English\" you see in most of the other classics. Shakespeare literally invented many, many words in the current English language. His work is really the foundation for many, if arguably not most, works in the English language during his time and after. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe final reason I'd recommend starting with Shakespeare is because the stories are easy to follow and well known. The stories themselves primarily center the emotions of human beings that transcend language. His characters are witty, funny, and compelling. They're characters that you *want* to root against, root for, or, at the very least, empathize with. While Shakespeare's settings may not always be the most familiar, as they are magical, otherworldly, or historical, the characters that inhabit those settings still share most our modern struggles with romance, attraction, death, mental health, and other issues that are universal to the human experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegardless of what you end up deciding to start with, I wish you happy reading and commend you for attempting to tackle such difficult reads in a language that is not native to you!

Because of this I suggest checking out a wiki of the work or \u201cspark notes\u201d so that you can ground yourself in the context of the work. For example, if one were to pick up Austen\u2019s \u201cPersuasion\u201d and read it in a vacuum it may seem underwhelming in a lot of ways, but if you give yourself 5-10 mins to read about Austen and 18th century Britain and how her writing is a critique of her society, it can give you some keywords and themes to look out that will help keep you grounded as you read, especially if you are ESL.",

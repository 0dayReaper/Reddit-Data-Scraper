    "postText": "This is my first book from the said author, which may be surprising that I did not start off with their more famous one \u2014 The Perfect Wife. \n\nCouple of things to say with this book is that I do see and understand why people, mainly booktok and bookstagram have been raving at how easy this thriller is to read. \n\nFormat and language wise, they are very easy to grasp and it is lovely at how despite using a lot of British english, they do provide a quick translation and/or analogy that would suit the American english.\n\nUnfortunately, this did not give me the suspense or thrilling feeling I was hoping to have. It was very straightforward that what you see is totally what you get. Though at the back of my head I was trying to excite myself by being more skeptical of the characters and the plot, I will stumble upon the reason as to why it isn't in just a couple of pages down. Halfway through the book I was juggling the idea of taking it as it is or question it more. However, upon reaching 70% of the book, I have realized that it won't have much more plot twists and what you were probably deducing from the beginning is everything this book is.\n\nIt could have been better, the plot twists shouldn't have been that unappealing and there should have been a lot more explaining of some parts such as &gt;! the child pornography allegations, the whole cheating persona of Maddie, Miles as a potential serial killer (couldn't clearly remember how many he killed but there were a lot of severely injured victims, was confused if the reason for Maddie's detachment towards Theo was because she was not her biological mother or was it because she was technically a self-diagnosed psychopath !&lt; some of which I felt a bit lacking and was kind of rushed. \n\nRating it as 3.5 on my end, it was a good and easy read but it was nothing that made me stay up at night hoping to feed the craving of finding out the plot twists and ending. I enjoyed reading it, it didn't feel like I wasted my time and IMO this is a good beginner's psychothriller book.",

It's basically unreadable for someone who isn't me because of how much sh!t it's covered in. \n\nAnd still, every time I wake up and go \"oh I have two hours before class today, I might start a book from the pile\" I see it whispering from the dark *no you will read me once again* and I can't resist the the temptation WHY",

That may not be the case for you, but for people struggling with anxiety the familiarity and lack of uncertainty can help alleviate symptoms. I know when I keep going back to familiar stuff only, my anxiety is often a little high so I see it as a sign to watch for.",

I find that I benefit from this in a way I wouldn't from broader analysis, and what I read in microcosm can usually be read elsewhere, and all the more easily for the experience.

But there are countless of anecdotes of authors (also musicians, poets, novelists, etc) who have historically and famously made fun of people who overthink, obsess, and unnecessarily read way too much into their works of art. There is a famous story about T. S. Eliot being at a reception of some kind in London in the mid-1930s, when a woman came up to him and said that she was absolutely astounded\nto find so much \"hidden meaning\" in his long poem, \"The Wasteland.\" She went on to outline a number of \"discoveries\" of hidden or coded meanings she had discovered, then asked him if he put these in on purpose. He replied, \"I had no idea that any of that was in my poetry, Madame. But if you have located it there, then it must be present.\" Maybe that's enough said.",

I particularly like that you've quoted it in support of the idea that people make too much of art, when I read it as precisely the opposite: that the presence of these discoveries is contingent only on \"if you have located it\", not Eliot's own idea of what's there. Reading, then, is a creative act: locating meaning guarantees its existence.\n\nYour closing line sums up your argument wonderfully, that \"Maybe that's enough said\". When analysis plays no role in the creation of meaning, the text (in this case your quote) is understood to speak for itself; the text itself is \"enough said\". But it is precisely because I feel the text cannot speak, *can only be analysed*, that I am able to disagree with your understanding of the quote! This is what enables analysis of literature, and disagreement, and discussion \u2013 I'd love to know if this changes the way you read the quote at all.\n\nThis can then be taken even further: when an author(ity) comments on the real meaning of a text, or derides those they consider wrong, this needn't be taken as some hallowed truth but as *another text to be analysed* \u2013 indeed, all statements would thus be interpreted, making language an indefinable nothing bouncing back and forth between a complex web of interpreters, all making meaning from the texts they are constantly encountering...",

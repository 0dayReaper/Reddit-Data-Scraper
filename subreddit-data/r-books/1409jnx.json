            "comment": "In a recliner where I can have proper neck support vs looking down at my book. Also, I have cubical and carpal tunnel syndromes. My arms and hands will go numb/hurt from the elbow down if I can\u2019t keep them semi straight. So, armrests help. Pillows help with this if reading in bed.\n\nEdited to add: Also, just want to point out I\u2019m only in my 30s. Even if you have no joint issues, etc try not to stay in crazy positions too long to *avoid* issues",

Knees often raised, right leg potentially up on the sofa back to get some hip stretch. Phone in my left hand, my elbow hinge resting on the sofa and naturally adjusting it to the correct distance for the text size. \n\nWhen in bed hoping to fall asleep: lying in fetal position (while hugging a body pillow that keeps my legs and arms comfortably separated) with my upper hand holding the phone, upper wrist cradled on lower wrist, using the Kindle or Libby app on the phone with the screen reversed to black background and white type, the brightness set very low, and sepia/night settings engaged. It's magic, and has nearly eliminated my decades-long battle with insomnia.",

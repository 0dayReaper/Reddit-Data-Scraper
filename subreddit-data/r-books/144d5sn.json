But it sometimes helps with my ADHD, when hearing the voice along with the text (it even underlines the current phrase, so that's nice). It's specially useful when going through a particularly dense book (e. g., history books), and has the advantage of being able to hear aloud more niche stuff that may not have an audiobook version.\n\nOne should preferably test this before buying. Again, the voices are very robotic and monotonous. I can't imagine using them as a real audiobook replacement. But it fulfilled being an \"attention aid\" pretty decently, while being versatile, mobile, and not needing an Internet connection.\n\nIf you are one of those ~~psychopaths~~ persons that read books in a phone or tablet, I think there are decent text-to-speech apps, too. Hell, I would be surprised if Android and iOS can't do it natively this days, as an accessibility option.",

It isn't possible to eat, have a decently tidy home, have clean clothes and a body without cooking, cleaning and washing without some sort of paid or personal assistance, which I do not have.\n\nThe headphones that I have, while not being noise cancelling have close fitting cups which cut a great deal of sound. They are also pretty heavy, which is a little comforting for some reason just by itself. I keep 3 or 4 books ready at all times so I can pick and choose. I have run into a couple of books that were literally triggering and had to be more careful, especially with certain genres.\n\nSometimes, and this may sound odd to some, I turn on an audiobook just to walk to the bathroom to urinate. It is something that takes me all of 2 minutes to walk, go, wash and return, but on some days I feel like the 'companionship' I get from having a voice in my ear talking about something interesting is necessary for me to feel comfortable doing something that most people see as an automatic or mundane function.\n\nI cannot promise that it's something that would work for everyone, but through trial and error I found that audiobooks both allowed me to enjoy books like I used too while giving me almost like a sidekick to \"chat with me\" while I do what I gotta do.\n\nI cannot just sit down and do nothing but listen to an audiobook, but there are enough things in the day that needs to be done that I go through books rather quickly.\n\nI cannot express the difference in my life that audiobooks and a wireless headset has made.\n\nIf audiobooks don't work for you, perhaps try other activities that you enjoy or used to enjoy. I really hope that you find something that works for you, and I also hope that my sharing helps others who may be struggling.",

The opinion of other people would depend on *what* was being read, not just the fact of reading, anyway (and just standard English ninteenth century classics aren't special either, those are like the obvious backbone of our literature, so obviously if you read much at all you're likely going to read at least some of those, and they're not difficult). That doesn't mean it's not desirable at all, but more the other way, that it would still be shocking not to read at all (as in, you go up to bed, brush your teeth, read for a bit. Brushing teeth is more a basic expectation than it is something extra, reading not so very dissimilar), thus it's normalised. Could change as younger people seem to read less. I can't imagine just 'Gosh, you're literate' being an impressive thing, though, obviously you should be, even our education system isn't quite that bad.\n\nI live in an area that's kind of a weird bubble of an exception, awful cultural problems, but that just means reading may be viewed *negatively* by some. But it's probably a bizarre extreme from a loud minority, and they might still read popular thrillers and so on. Which isn't terribly socially desirable.",

Me and my numerous siblings would fight over the channels. One day the TV broke, and my papa gave it to my cousin frankie. He said there would be no more TV in our house, because he didn't want kids who had \"boob-tube-itis.\" After that day, as a family we would go once a week, in the evening, to the library. I would get a stack of books, and I would read them, even though my mom would say \"lights out.\" I would read by the Light of the hall coming in through a crack in the doorway, My bunk bed right next to the door. Through life's sorrows and life's joys, I've always read, and I make a weekly trip to the library to collect my holds and turn in the books I've read. Without books, my life would be bleak indeed.",

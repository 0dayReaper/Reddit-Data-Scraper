When you get down to it, human beings are fundamentally a pro-social, cooperative species that tends to unite in the face of an immediate threat. It's a bit of a cliche at this point, and somewhat inaccurate, but Aristotle's idea that \"man is a political animal,\" comes to mind.\n\nBut even more, a lot of the people Jungee interviewed in that book apparently *missed* the moment of crisis in an odd way (even given things like trying to survive in the Siege of Sarajevo) precisely *because* the outside threat generated such a powerful, community-building response. It cut across social groups and hierarchies and brought people together into one tightly-knit tribe.",

To me, it seemed like the survivors should have been able to carve out a community together, defend it, and slowly expand their influence and eliminate the zombies as they brought in more survivors. I know that everyone was infected and would turn into a zombie when they died, but in a true community that risk would be mitigated both by improving the chances that people would recover if injured and also by changing funeral practices so that people who died would be rekilled quickly and humanely before body disposal. \n\nI know they found a few places like that in the show but they were usually either secret cannibal communities (why???) or extreme dictatorships. Not that dictator-like communities wouldn\u2019t exist (to a certain extent they could be needed. While dictatorships are frowned on, strong arm single leaders can get shit done), but they never seemed to find a single place where people were surviving and improving life for their citizens. Every community was either secretly evil or about to be destroyed by an evil group.",

Instead, civility seems to be an intrinsic human quality shared among most people, with a few exceptions. Interestingly, it seems like the expectation that civilisation is a veneer on top of egocentrism and strife leads to people acting that way, perhaps out of a desire to protect themselves.\n\nIf you're interested, there's a recent book by historian Rutger Bregman that you could check out. In it he looks at the two main theories about human nature (brute with a veneer of society, or a noble creature that's brought to conflict by society, government, and property) and whether there's any proof one way or the other in history. It's worth a read!",

Humans operate nearly entirely on trust. There's nothing stopping us from backing out on a deal and take something without fulfilling our own end of the bargain. Most agreements are easily breakable if we were to be completely self-centered. But we know that once trust is broken, it's gone for good. Backstabbing people for one's own benefit is not a sign of intelligence or enlightenment. If we didn't know how to cooperate, humanity would be dead thrice over by now. \n\nAlso, helping comrades out feels good. These are virtues innate to us. Human empathy is extremely powerful and I think it's a natural thing for humans to be averse to murder. But a lot of modern works seem to pretend that virtues are things indoctrinated to us and that evil is in fact the intelligent thing to do, something that I find to be extremely shortsighted.",

In the book Sapiens, it is stated that Homo sapiens evolutionary advantage over the seemingly superior Neanderthal human species (can\u2019t remember their science name off the top of my head) was that we gossiped. I think the author also stated our capacity for imagination is higher.\n\nThese two abilities are key because they allow the development of trust in large social networks, and also the ability to create totally fabricated ideas and use them to create order within the complex social structure. \n\nFor example, you might be more inclined to trade with a person who is a friend of a friend of a friend, rather than one from another tribe. That\u2019s the gossip at work. \n\nAnother example, value is completely imagined, yet we put value into a lot of things, such as the dollar today.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t given the book a read then I would highly recommend it!

He uses the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska in 1964 as a lens to explore the ways that communities come together to survive catastrophic events. \n\nOne thing he said stuck with me. He talked to people in many places that had survived disaster and heard the same thing from each of them. Everyone he spoke to first repeated the trope that disaster and hard times bring out the worst in people, that it degrades people and people are capable of horrible things, Lord of the Flies style. But then every person gave a reason why their community was exceptional, was not like that. Why did Alaskans work together selflessly to rebuild? \"Alaskans are just like that.\" \n\nEveryone everywhere seems to believe this story about human nature, that in a state of nature we'd be cruel and mercenary. But then people everywhere also find a reason to transcend it, and the author found this to be the case almost universally. Everyone thinks that their community is the exception to the rule, but actually, it is the rule.",

It should be our role to provide alternatives to dystopia as much as depict their dangers. Unfortunately, very few have accepted his challenge. \n\nI see it as a cultural product of the cynicism that overtook all of us after the lost idealism of the 60s. As a Gen X sci-fi writer myself, I\u2019ve been unable to gain any kind of audience or momentum from being anything other than cynical and ironic my whole career. Back in the 80s this cynicism helped rescue us from the feverish narcissism of the 70s but it has gone much too far for too long. \n\nWe\u2019ve inoculated ourselves from sincerity, optimism, and progress. Now these tendencies have been weaponized in the age of social media and we don\u2019t know how to regain them.",

It was a critique on the notion that British people are inherently civilised even the proper children, vs the rest of the world is cruel and savage - unless the missionaries have fixed them of course! Golding had two sons and was like \"wtf children can be monsters to each other regardless of whether they're British or not!\"\n\n[Great article on it here!](https://www.william-golding.co.uk/lord-flies-coral-island)",

I read that before I read *Lord of the Flies*, and the conversation the characters have about it has always colored my interpretation of Golding's novel. \n\nTwo characters are discussing how *Lord of the Flies* ends. The mentor character mentions something that Golding himself had allegedly written, which supposedly helps to explain the ending. I don't know if Golding actually said this or if King just made it up, but here's the relevant passage:\n\n&gt;\u201cAs best as I can remember, it was something like this: \u2018The boys are rescued by the crew of a battle-cruiser, and that is very well for them, but who will rescue the crew?\u2019\u201d\n\nMeaning, the adults of the world are also all just little kids stranded on an island. The conflict between the kids is just an allegory for the grown-ups starting wars and blowing each other up all the damn time.\n\nTo expect that all the boys should have gotten along peaceably and banded together for the better good, is to expect that the grown-ups of the world should do the same, and fat chance of that happening.",

            "comment": "If you're interested in that sort of story, there's a story like that about children stuck in Ararat over the winter, the original was russian but I don't remember the original title, the german translation was published in the GDR as \u201cGefangene der Pantherschlucht\u201d. Not sure if there is an english translation, but I do recall the book alleging it was based on real events (nothing in it strikes me as too fantastical, but this would have taken place sometime in early 20th century in a region that isn't very likely to have lots of english language newspapers reporting about it; so I couldn't find any references to the original events it would've been based on. As far as I know the claim could've just as well been a gimmick to make children more interested in the tale).\n\nIt is in terms of story actually quite similar to the one that has been told here - except taking place in the mountains instead of the sea. A small group of children head into the mountains (mostly out of boredom), one of them suggests checking out a valley, where they end up stuck because of a freak snowstorm blocking the passage by which they entered. While they do quarrel, it's mostly an encouraging tale about people cooperating in the face of adversity.\n\nThe german version was originally published in 1960, no idea about the russian one, would be amazing if someone here knew anything about that!",

Especially as, even as recent as the 1960s, Tongan life was more traditional than it is today. For instance,  compasses hadn't fully caught on yet - they were increasingly being adopted, but it wasn't totally unusual at the time to go for a sail without a map &amp; compass. The book \"We, the Navigators\" was written in 1972 and the author interviewed and sailed with lots of people from across the Pacific still practising traditional navigation.",

I got the sense that Golding was trying to say, some people are good, and probably even a smaller percentage are bad. But most people, and this is what made the novel so thought provoking for me, are malleable and will do whatever they can to survive. And if that means following a leader that is blood thirsty to stay on the winning side then they will do so. The masks they don in the novel is also a nod to how when humans don a mask, or a \u201cuniform\u201d they somehow become detached from their true selves and act in a more primitive way. Examples being the Nazis donning their uniforms. This has also been touched upon in [Darren Brown\u2019s mask experiment ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ReUHhStG70k). I genuinely believe most humans have good intentions but I also believe that it is very easy to succumb to our primitive nature in the right circumstances. In the way that an alcoholic doesn\u2019t want to drink but the addiction has resulted in the more primitive part of their brain compelling them to do so, despite their true self not wanting to. Just my two cents.",

We were quick to believe the Milgram and Stanford prison experiments because they traded on that. Both of those experiments have been mostly debunked; people on the whole are just nicer than that and it is the brutes and the sociopaths who are the fascinating exception.

    "postText": "Billy coming across the hermit living in the abandoned church and the writing of that entire sequence floored me.  I was enthralled in the story the hermit told and the philosophical asides throughout the story.  I found that to be my favorite section of the book and some of the best pages I\u2019ve read of anything.  I\u2019m currently reading cities of the plain.  The border trilogy has been a fantastic reading experience overall.",

            "comment": "I adore that book. The whole trilogy actually. Cities of the Plain is the \"weakest\" but it's still great... especially the last 50 pages or so. If you enjoyed the philosophy of the ex-priest in The Crossing, you will definitely love the last section of CotP. I don't want to spoil anything, but I think it's some of McCarthy's best writing.",

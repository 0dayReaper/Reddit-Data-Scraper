    "postText": "Last night I finished All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. Without a doubt it is immediately my favorite book I have ever read. It made me cry more than a few times, which I can\u2019t say another book has caused me to ever do.\n\nI was at the point where von Rumpel enters Number 4 Rue Vauborel to search for the Sea of Flames, and I had well over 100 pages left, but I couldn\u2019t stop reading it. I should have just read a few of the short chapters and set it aside to keep reading throughout the rest of the week and savored it. But I ended up finishing, and now everything in my life seems bleak, empty, and gray.\n\nI have had \u201cbook hangovers\u201d in the past but this one has hit me harder than any before. I can\u2019t focus on anything, nothing interests me besides the story, and I daydream of Marie-Laure, Werner, Jutta, and all the intricacies of the story. I hear Clair de Lune playing over and over in my head, albeit that is my fault for listening to it on repeat for a few days. It is such a beautiful song, and enhances my emotions for the story every time I listen.\n\nI wish I could escape the monotony of my life again. I wish I could live within the story. I wish I could be there for Marie-Laure like her Papa, Etienne, and Werner were. I wish I could feel her experiences and sense the world the way that she does through heightened senses cause by her blindness. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how a fictional character has made such an impression on me. I will butcher the quote, but I feel like when Werner was trying to not forget Marie-Laure after they parted ways during the ceasefire in Saint-Malo. He wanted to remember her but knows that if he continually tries to draw up memories then they will be overused and he will forget.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. I kind of want to start it over from the beginning again, but I know I will eventually be left in the same headspace I am now, and knowing the ending of the story I\u2019m sure the experience will be different. I want to tell everyone about the book and how much it is affecting me emotionally but I just don\u2019t think they will understand, and I don\u2019t want to be annoying.\n\nI\u2019m just an emotional wreck.",

Like \"All the Light\" times 4.   Which is not to say I enjoyed it more, just that it takes place in 4 different settings so you get more of his brilliant characters.  There are two here that may remind you of Marie-Laure.",

The title comes right from the Greek Tragedy and is heavily inspired by it. My boyfriend loved All The Light so I got him Cloud Cuckoo Land and Birds so he could read them both. \ud83d\ude0a",

Ending, especially Werner's sister way of processing what had happened, made it really impactful for me. That said, it felt like young adult fiction, due to lack of character complexity and lack of opinion on what was going on. I was deeply unsatisfied when the characters' roads finally meet.",

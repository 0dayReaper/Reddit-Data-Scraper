Strangely enough, I rewatched that series recently after over a decade, and I felt that it really had a bit of a  Stephen King \u201cvibe\u201d to it. This may be a coincidence, or mean nothing at all, but I noticed that Mikami\u2019s locker number at the gym (where Near\u2019s associate gets his Death Note from to tamper with it) is 19. The number 19 has a huge significance in King\u2019s Dark Tower series, also appearing in some of his other works ( I think), and even has significance in King\u2019s personal life. I don\u2019t remember what year this happened, but iirc he was struck by a car while walking on the side of the road. The date was the 19th.\n\nEdit: \u201cObits\u201d, the short story in Bazaar of Bad Dreams, was first published in 2015. So yeah, his take on Death Note, not the other way around.",

Once he's done that, *then* he'll either show it to his wife or his proper editor, the finishing touches get put on, and then the book gets published (which is the easy part cause it's Stephen King and he could literally shart on a page and probably get it published in hard and paperback.)\n\nDefinitely recommend it to anybody even marginally interested in writing.",

There's plot points like how when he was a poor teacher, he saw girls abusing a poor girl for period stains and he thought that was particularly cruel because they likely all had a similar first time... and that's when he thought of Carrie. How could you be so viscious to a girl that's already destitute and suffering in general you go out of your way to be cruel about a bodily function by a confused girl. Psychology scaring to the point Stephen King thought would awaken psychological powers and take revenge. \n\nSo yeah it spoils I guess the general theme and maybe a scene from Carrie, but if you've seen the movie you already pieced together the theme.",

I was at the worst of my depression and an alcoholic. One night, I re-read On Writing and reached the part where King describes being drunk at his mother\u2019s funeral\n\n&gt; My mother was buried out of the Congregational Church at\nSouthwest Bend; the church she\u2019d attended in Methodist\nCorners, where my brother and I grew up, was closed\nbecause of the cold. I gave the eulogy. **I think I did a pretty\ngood job, considering how drunk I was**\n\nFor some reason, that broke me down. I starting crying. I realized how I was living my life at that time and hated it more than I had. So I worked at cleaning myself up. I started trying to drink less (I also tried to quit cold turkey but that didn\u2019t happen), I started moderating myself. I worked to make a system and put myself into writing things when I wanted a drink (I ended up writing a lot). For whatever reason, that one line just struck a chord and I wanted to change",

It\u2019s supposed to be this moment where they leave innocence, become adults and manage to overcome IT and escape the sewers. \n\nPlease read the ending before you lambast me. \n\nIt makes sense in the context. Essentially IT is the embodiment of everything wrong with the town and the people in it. He represents everything the kids hate. Abusiva parents, latent homosexual urges, racism, homophobia, guilt, and helplessness. Things that kids struggle with the most. \n\nThey defeated it by not being afraid of it and fighting and figuring some way to stand on their own. Ben faces his bully, Eddie stood up to his mom. \n\nThen they were trapped in the sewers as children and needed to break free. The only way to escape is to retain a bond and grow up. What\u2019s another thing that is talked about it a disgusting way but is also something teens talk about and even do behind people\u2019s backs? Sex. We don\u2019t like to talk about IT, but IT happens. Sex essentially allows them to escape IT (fear) and the sewers (symbolic for the twists and turns of childhood). \n\nHaving said all of that; what the fuck, Stephen? There\u2019s literally a million other ways to become adults that don\u2019t involve Beverly telling all her friends to fuck her in a sewer when they were 13. Like come on.\n\nI blame cocaine. He\u2019s made a few other stupid scenes in his books but they never get to that point. It\u2019s weird. Aside from a few weird moments with tweets, the man has a clean reputation.",

I\u2019ve been able to fully give in to my guilty pleasure, genre writing. The Dark Tower and 11/22/63 are fantastic pieces of genre writing. That being said, there are many reasons readers will dismiss Stephen King as being a mediocre writer: bloated novels, bad endings, overused tropes, etc. All of these are true to one extent or another. The man has produced a huge catalogue of work. Some are bound to be...wonky. However, the one thing he does as well as any living author is write believable, interesting and relatable characters. At the end of the day, this is the driving force behind all his work and why he\u2019ll always be appreciated and never be forgotten, as an author.",

It barely advances the plot, time sort of resets a little here and there, and it\u2019s just him living in the 60s for like 500 pages. \n\nBut the relationship he builds between the two leads is what the book is really about.

He is a fantastic story teller, and has great characters. Also noticed a shit ton of his books have elements (bad guys) of the Dark Tower in them!

That, and there was a much more powerful (and snotty) literary establishment than there is now. And they were all harsh about King's works. They dragged him through the mud, every single time. \n\nAnd it went on for years. When he won the O. Henry award, there was this huge outcry in the literary community. His work isn't real literature, etc.\n\n I don't remember the name of the speaker who spoke after him at the ceremony, but she essentially said, \"We don't need your opinions on literature.\" So he's a little bitter about how he's been treated by critics, and I think it's understandable.",

For decades, his writing was derided by literary critics as having absolutely no value. Dude grew up and taught English in a time where anything resembling genre fiction was massively shit on in academia.  He would have fights with his professors and later bosses about the value of detective stories and pulp novels. Now, he's considered a part of the American canon, and is one of the most recognized and read authors in this country. He truly did outlive the majority of his criticism.",

    "postText": "Gonna preface by saying I love a good analog mystery/horror novel. I also love when a book just keeps me going and going. This book did this, but I cannot say it was for wanting to keep going and more because I was wondering if I missed something. That's honestly how this book felt while I read it, but I know I didn't miss anything or skipped a page. I'm really just wondering if anyone who read this book had similar feelings and if it felt like things felt just not completely finished in discussion? \n\nIt wasn't a bad book, but just something felt missed and I cannot put my finger on it.",

The mystery/premise was good but the ending doesn\u2019t feel like a big reveal. I feel like the plot looks at you and goes \u201cthis is how it ends because it makes, right?\u201d",

It felt just rushed, and Michael and his cult, though, was interesting -  just didn't feel right with everything. That was probably the part I enjoyed from the whole book the most, but I thought it had meaning with the tapes... and it really didn't. \n\nI want to read Wolf in White Van at some point.",

They always resonate with me when I'm at my lowest - there's a comfort and peace that comes from letting go of the need to make sense of things. They often seem at their core to be about existing with uncertainty and ambiguity. Like vonneguts books, and the nightvale lot and a bunch of elijah woods  recent producer roles, I find them very healing.\n\nIt's not how we traditionally expect stories to go though so it can feel deeply dissatisfying if you're not expecting it. I can see how it could feel like a cop out.",

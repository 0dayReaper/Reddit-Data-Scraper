What makes the book great is how beautifully written the prose is. Theres all of these wordplays and sort of inside jokes going on throughout the book that just make the experience that much better. Nabokov\u2019s ability to write an untrustworthy narrator is top notch. Although its not to the same extent as some of his other works, what happens in Lolita is still a heavily filtered version of what may have actually happened through the eyes of a pedophile. As the reader, we don\u2019t get to know what Dolores thought of it all. We only get to see how much Humbert loved her and why he thought what he was doing was right.",

The incredible feat of the book is that the subject matter is so utterly repulsive and vile, while the the prose and language used to describe it are just immaculate. Truly some of the best prose of all time.\n\n\nThe book and its author do not in any way promote pedophilia, but the style in which the book is written seduces the reader themself, and in some way makes you an 'accomplice' to the protagonist's crimes.  A summary will never suffice though. It is far more ambiguous, layered, and self-reflexive than most books.",

Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita. Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.\u201d",

From my understanding there\u2019s no actual sex scenes but they\u2019re very strongly implied, and even though I\u2019m only 50ish pages in, his attraction to her/\u2018nymphets\u2019/girls is by no means subtle. \n\n\nIt\u2019s controversial because it\u2019s beautifully written, which contrasts heavily with the contents of the story. Humbert doesn\u2019t sound like a monster with how it\u2019s presented to you, even though he\u2019s sick.",

Nothing seriously reprehensible or heinous, but as a former alcoholic I've had my share of crazy nights and moments of stupidity. It's not who I truly was at heart. I wanted to be someone better. But I've totally turned things around and been stone sober for the last 18 months. I won't go back to my old ways.\n\nI don't white knight or virtue signal or take holier-than-thou stances on anything. There's one thing I've learned about human behavior in all of my great and terrible times: people are complicated. People, myself included, fuck up...some more than others but the principle is the same. Everyone has made mistakes and done the wrong thing for selfish, shortsighted reasons. It's extremely difficult for me to get legitimately angry and chastise someone because I've experienced enough to know what kind of guilt and shame he/she is feeling. It's often indescribable.\n\nI don't think the people playing holier than thou on social media are all guilty of some hidden wrongdoing of their own. Many of them probably *are* hiding something. The rest are shouting due to their *lack* of life experiences and personal mistakes. They haven't been exposed to the other side, personality variations, and showing sympathy/empathy when it's the last thing you want to do. They haven't faced the ethical conundrum of seeing someone they know well and respect do something shameful. It's not so black-and-white. Because people are unbelievably complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.....but FUCK this principal. If he did all of what he's been accused of then he really is the absolute worst kind of person.",

Experience is really key when it comes to being open-minded. I've never been very judgemental of others' mistakes, but I can certainly admit that I had a more black-and-white view of morality before trauma led me straight into drug addiction, which promptly kicked me in the ass and took me down a few pegs. Making mistakes really demonstrates the fact that much of the world is one big shade of grey and that, as you say, people are complicated. And the silver lining of adversity is that it frequently creates empathy.\n\nAlso, congrats on your 18 months of sobriety! I've been clean for 6 months.",

Its MY job to make sure the kids don't take something too intense for them at that moment in their life. That doesn't mean in two years, when they've grown, they STILL can't read it. Honestly, if we didn't have such literature, kids would not be able to learn and empathize with others who are suffering. That's more important than keeping them \"safe\".",

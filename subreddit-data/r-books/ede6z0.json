            "comment": "Wow, it's wild to see this project of mine on the front page! Also wild how literal the timing was; you posted this while I was [actually building one of the boards](https://twitter.com/josecastillo/status/1208127994893668353) this afternoon. \n\nPacking for a trip tonight but happy to answer folks' questions as much as I can. To preempt a few: \n\n* Open source software for Linux-based eReaders [does exist](https://github.com/koreader/koreader), but I'm trying to build open source hardware, the idea being that that anyone can buy the parts and build the whole thing themselves.\n* It doesn't run Linux; in order to be as hand-solderable and simple as possible, it uses a SAMD51 microcontroller, which makes it more like a really powerful Arduino than an iPad.\n* [The project page on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/168761-the-open-book-feather) lists some of the specs. Things to be stoked about: microSD slot, MP3 playback, e-ink screen, physical buttons, global language support. Things that folks will be unhappy with: 1-bit display (no grayscale for now); no touchscreen, no backlight, no wifi. I've been making tradeoffs in order to make it both as affordable and as DIY friendly as I can, and while I know that's not everyone's cup of tea, the design is open source so that anyone can use it as a baseline to build a device that makes more sense for them.\n* The software portion of things is still in its infancy; this is an idea I had earlier this year, and I'm proud of how far I've gotten the hardware, but we're still a ways out from the kind of user experience that the reporter described in this story. He didn't ask me any questions other than \"can I use the photos\", which is frustrating because I feel like he described a lot of capabilities that I hope one day to have, but that aren't nearly real yet.\n\n[Here's the GitHub page](https://github.com/joeycastillo/The-Open-Book) where I commit all the work I'm doing day to day, and on the advice of a colleague, I set up [a mailing list](https://joeycastillo.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d31d40071448f3aa8acc39836&amp;id=d9134648c8) where I plan to send out an update once I've nailed down manufacturing and this becomes a product you can actually buy (like if you don't want to solder one together yourself).",

I'd actually been considering launching a Patreon page next year, but right now this is all kind of a labor of love; it's an idea that was stuck in my head that I just needed to get out. The first time I read a story on it \u2014 [Brokeback Mountain by Annie Proulx](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/10/13/brokeback-mountain), incidentally; I copied the text from the New Yorker website to my prototype to read it in bed \u2014 I was so stoked, because as a reader and as a maker, it felt incredible to read something on something I made, and I sensed that people would feel really empowered by that as well. As long as folks are stoked about that idea, all the buzz is useful :)\n\nEDIT: as a side note, Brokeback Mountain is a short read and a really powerful story; I sense that readers of /r/books would love it.

At the moment this seems more of a exercise in electronics or precaution against Amazon overstepping (deleting either of the bits I mentioned from kindles) in the future, not an immediate problem.\n\nAlso, DRM free isn't really what this is about, its about full open source, like Linux.

I'm guessing no, but whatever you run in the terminal could probably do that. I'm thinking screen or tmux might have options like that. I guess you could try scrolling up, maybe with shift+pgup and see if it prevents scrolling, or bind a key on the virtual keyboard to scroll lock, but I haven't tried.\n\nHere's the terminal program I've used: https://www.fabiszewski.net/kindle-terminal/",

Couldn't justify to myself spending even mroe on remarkable, although I heard software there is much better. Big selling point was it can run android aps, so I could use Tachiyomi for mangas, browse net, read *Pocket, etc.*",

Also how does battery life compare to a Kindle? The Onyx seems to be closer to a tablet as far as performance, so I wouldn't expect anywhere near Kindle battery life.  How many hours of reading can you get before recharging?",

As of 2 or 3 years ago could do 3 colours but the refresh rate was low and it required a refresh each page. I am sure they've made advancements since then and that it will come at some point.  There are only about 15m or so ereaders sold each year as of a few years ago. Probably the same or just less this year so demand unfortunately isn't high enough to push up R&amp;D resources. Also, E-ink isn't the only manufacturer so they aren't selling all 15m of those screens. I would guess other manufacturers are working on it too but with smaller budgets.\n\nThis is based on my experience in the industry. I wasn't on hardware side mind you.",

I manage my library with Calibre, everything I have is epub, converted to epub or might be PDF.\n\nOne thing the market is missing are small e-readers. A 5\" e-reader can fit easily in a bag or even a pocket. It's too bad Sony got out of the market, their devices were excellent.",

I guess luddites might have a problem figuring out Calibre, but my 87 year old brother (I am 58) turned me onto Calibre as he says he is on a \"fixed income\" so he gets DRM free books through some kind of black magic and puts them on his kindle with Calibre.   \n\n\nI buy all my ebooks from amazon because I also get the Audio book copy that comes at a discount when buying the ebook I can then move back and forth between reading and listening and everything stays in sync.  Plus I also love the x-ray and dictionary/wikipedia features that you get with Amazon purchased ebooks.  \n\n\nIf I was afraid of Amazon removing all my books I would just download a copy of them to my PC, but I am not worried that Amazon would kill their business model by removing paid for books from their customers.",

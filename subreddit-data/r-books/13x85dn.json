    "postText": "Reading those books as an adult and, except for the first and the last, they are like reading *The Glass Castle* except Pa doesn't have a drinking problem, and Laura never comes to realize she doesn't have to live without friends or family (outside of her parents and siblings) nearly starving or freezing to death regularly (or being terrified by Indians or nearly dying of malaria). \n\nAll the stories make it seem like they just keep having extraordinarily bad luck, but they all manage to survive due to Pa's intelligence and ingenuity. But they all got in those fixes because of Pa.\n\n--------\n\nEDIT: Wow, such good discussion! First of all, clearly I mean \"What Pa put them all through just because he could **NOT** share The Big Woods with a few more people is insane.\" \n\nI did not think people would be so interested, so let me elaborate a bit. When I was young girl, a daddy-loving tomboy much like Laura, I saw their lives as full of adventures with Pa showing them over and over how he could do just about anything and save them from anything - he was the ultimate hero.\n\nBut then I read them again from the beginning as an adult. I usually dismissed the first book, *Little House in the Big Woods,* as a fairy tale for little kids with little grit. But it's a story of a happy full childhood, tucked into the woods. They have a vibrant family social life, full of cousins, holidays, and big family get-togethers. They have ample food because they clearly have a lot of farmland and a huge horticultural area (they describe all the stored good in the attic and it seems like it could feed a village). Pa grows cash crops, sells pelts in town (a short walk), and hunts for meat to eat. They make a nice living.\n\nWhen more people move into the Big Woods, Pa decides he would not be able to live totally self-sufficiently because he would have to share the wild game with others and he just doesn't like living near people. (I think they also need to pay some sort of rent on their land, which Pa also objects to.)\n\nWhen you know the story of the life they left behind - the relative comforts and the family life - it seems so tragic that Pa keeps \"dragging them from Pillar to Post\" (as Caroline puts it, more than once) for so little reward and with so much suffering.\n\nBy the time they get to South Dakota, Laura is so de-socialized she is genuinely afraid of people. She hates being around anyone but her family. Eventually, fate makes it so they have to live in town sometimes and she does get to go to school and make friends and she seems to thrive. But it 's like Pa wants to live completely isolated from civilization and feels entitled to make his family live with this same isolation and all the perils that come with it.\n\nReading it again, it is also clear that Caroline is very brave and resourceful herself, but she really dislikes living such an isolated life and the more they move and the less populated the areas are, the harder it is for her but her husband doesn't seem to care.",

They went through sheer hell, like a lot of covered wagon settlers did.  Pa was never successful at farming.  The family moved out on rent and bills in the middle of the night several times.  The Long Winter was far less cozy because there was another couple living with them the whole time and they did not get along.  Laura took a job in town and was sexually harassed and probably assaulted.  It goes on and on.",

They\u2019re books that deserve to have these tensions interrogated and their subtle and unsubtle propaganda understood. And between all that, they\u2019re still absolutely gorgeous at times.

The crazy thing to me, though, is they\u2019re very judgmental towards anyone they consider to be taking advantage of the system, while taking full advantage of different government programs themselves. The land settlement program that got them the land they lived on in North Dakota was a socialist program. They also live off of \u201cChristian charity\u201d in some of the earlier books with many of their Christmas gifts coming as hand me downs from other families. All the while the idea that they had to work hard for everything and never got any help so others shouldn\u2019t be helped is a theme, especially in the later books. They definitely were hard workers but they certainly didn\u2019t live in a vacuum.",

J. Howard Pew, a prominent donor, and advocate of unregulated capitalism, was friends with Lane and influenced the stories to promote individual self-sufficiency and discredit the role of government. The series is part of a broader cultural and religious propaganda apparatus constructed by free-market fundamentalists. The Big Myth draws attention to the strategic efforts by libertarian groups, such as bulk book purchases and distribution in schools, to promote Ayn Rand's works and Ronald Reagan's advocacy of free market fundamentalism. These revelations shed light on the influence of right-wing disinformation and the dissemination of free-market propaganda.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk4c65oAMro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk4c65oAMro)",

The language often implies that they never needed help from others,  but if you really look at them,  you see that they helped others,  others helped each other,  and even that they got some help now and again.   Help building houses,  help when they were all sick,  monetary gifts,  etc.  They didn't often stand totally alone,  and when they did,  life was hard.  \n\nI've also read some other books about Laura's life,  and it becomes pretty clear that anything that didn't fit that successfyl  rugged individualist theme was glossed over or omitted entirely,  along with some tragedies that were judged to be too harsh for a children's book.  So these people are literally crafting lifestyles around a work of fiction with all the bad parts left out - a cotton candy version of the life of a pioneer.  It's still portraying a hard life,  but not as hard as the reality.",

It does not depict an interesting or attractive life at all.\n\nYou may be confusing \"preppers\" with \"back to a simpler life\" folks. The latter are all about living a more simple, less media-corrupted life. We have some friends who do this. They have an organic farm, raise most of the foods they eat, contribute to seed banks, advocate for non-GMO foods, etc. They feel that people in the U.S. are too obsessed by consumer goods, and enjoy their life.\n\n\"Preppers\" are people who are planning for either social collapse (think what happened January 6 at the Capitol on a country-wide level, food riots, supply chains broken down, no social services available) or weather/weapons disaster. This goes back to the 1950s and 1960s when we kids were bombarded with the knowledge that the Russians might attack the U.S. with nuclear weapons and everyone needed to have a fallout shelter with food and water supplies. (People will tell you this is all propaganda, but there were several instances besides the Cuban Missile Crisis where we did almost stand on the edge of a nuclear war.) They're the ones who would read the Little House books with for ideas to survive--they're just trying to live, they don't want to live like that to be \"interesting\" or \"attractive.\"",

It's hard not to get frustrated at her for not putting her foot down earlier, but I try to remember that she may not have had the power to.  The book reads like one example after another of Pa's dumbassery and Caroline pulling herself and her children through the consequences with or without PA.  How many times did PA abandon them to their circumstances? Like great that you made it home through the blizzard with the Christmas presents, but you almost made my kids fatherless in the wilderness a-f**king-again. The fact that Laura centers Pa as the hero shows what a good job Caroline did of somehow shielding her kids from what must have been her daily abject terror at their vulnerability.",

I think Laura the author did realize that a lot of it was messed up or she wouldn't have decided to soft-pedal/skip those parts since she's writing for children and didn't think that things like the death of her baby brother or herself being groped by a cousin/someone at the hotel they had to work at would really fit in well with the story. Also, while little Laura hero-worships her father, older Laura in the later books is more measured, and the characters are all presented three-dimensionally enough that I could reread the books as an adult and realize that I was pretty much entirely on Ma's side now (OK, not with \"the only good Indian is a dead Indian\" but in terms of not wanting to keep uprooting their family in pursuit of a dream that will never happen).",

            "comment": "TL; DR  Studying Laura Ingalls Wilder is a hobby of mine. \n\nI first read the \u201cLittle House Books\u201d when I was in third grade. I became obsessed with them in a way no other books had grabbed me, except for Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s \u201cThe Secret Garden\u201d and \u201cA Little Princess.\u201d  They described what day-to-day life was like for a little girl \u201cback then\u201d in a way no other stories did. \n\nMy fascination endured. I first began to realize that Laura\u2019s books weren\u2019t strictly autobiographical when I read \u201cThe First Four Years,\u201d which had been published posthumously without editing. It was rather jolting, because as a kid I felt the books were Laura\u2019s telling of literally true stories, and the voice in the unedited book about the difficult first years of her marriage was so different. \n\nThis led to my reading \u201cOn the Way Home,\u201d which is her diary about moving with her husband and child by wagon from South Dakota to settle (permanently) in Missouri. I also read Rose Wilder Lane\u2019s, \u201cLet the Hurricane Roar\u201d about Charles and Caroline Ingalls, which shows the difference between the two women\u2019s writing styles, using the same material. \n\n\nI then ended up reading biographies of both Laura and Rose, and anything else about Laura I could find. I\u2019ve even been able to visit many of the sites where the family lived\u2014Peppin, WI;Walnut Grove, MN; De Smet, SD; Mansfield, MO\u2014and the books don\u2019t even record all of the moves, as the family did more back-tracking than just being forced out of Kansas. Most recently I read a book called \u201cLibertarians on the Prairie\u201d about the political underpinnings woven into them mentioned in an earlier comment. \n\nMy conclusion after all this is that Laura and Rose collaborated on the books, and their often troubled partnership is what makes the books unique. Laura\u2019s books do describe great hardship and deprivation, but they also reframe her experiences in a way that infuses them with meaning.  They are Laura\u2019s stories and a memorial to her parents, but Rose was a professional writer intimately connected to those stories, and she definitely did a lot of editing. Their letters show the tremendous amount of back-and-forth discussion that went into the process. \n\nAre the books racist? Yes, although it is interesting that the negative references to American Indians primarily come from Caroline Ingalls (who, for example, remarks at one point that the only good Indian is a dead Indian).  However, her attitude is markedly different from that of Laura and her father, who are both clearly intrigued by the vastly different people and culture. Laura gives very vivid and emotionally laden descriptions of the way the  Indians she saw looked and moved, and they seem to represent freedom from a circumscribed life, even if she is afraid. In \u201cThe Long Winter\u201d it is a wise elderly Indian who comes to warn the white settlers of the months of constant blizzards ahead.  It is also noted that the doctor who saves the Ingalls from dying of malaria in Kansas is African American, and that Laura had never seen someone with such dark skin before. One of the aspects of her personality that always comes through in her books is how her curiosity outweighs her fear. She was a wonderful observer and describer. \n\nAll that to say, I still believe these books are worth reading, and preserve a personal version of history. I think that Laura struggled with traditional gender roles\u2014a theme throughout the books\u2014and she identified more with her adventurous, charming Pa than her gentle, rigidly proper Ma. I think that there is something to the fact that in spite of the hard life her father\u2019s choices led to, he was a present and involved parent who spent time with his girls.  Later in life, he spent much more time away from them, working as a carpenter. His heroic image fades a bit by the time Laura is 16 and starts working to help support her family.  Pa is shown accepting all of the money Laura has earned from one of the terms of school she taught, and he uncomfortably admits it is needed. Laura viewed herself as an equal and valued member of her family very young, and she remained an assertive person her whole life. \n\nOk so maybe I get a little overly enthused with this topic!",

Furthermore, in real life she was actually pregnant with Carrie when they left Wisconsin; she was helpingto build that log cabin in her last trimester and gave birth on the prairie. Physically she was vulnerable as were her daughters. She'd undoubtedly heard and read stories of massacres. When you have random Natives knocking on your door and coming in to help themselves to your supplies and you've heard stories about what's happened to families and children like yours, and you're living in an isolated log cabin with a quilt for a door, not a lot of people are going to sit back and consider the root causes of why this is happening.

They had no success AND he got ill and was left needing a cane to walk... I wonder how those conversations went between the two of them, because I picture Laura being fairly insistent that it's time to give up on farming with him in that condition, but it didn't happen.\n\nActually I didn't learn until today what happened in the following years. They did end up leaving and living on Almanzo's parents' farm for a year, then tried living in Florida for a while (Laura disliked it), then moved back to De Smet near the Ingalls family... and lived in town for 3 years! Almanzo was a carpenter and Laura was a seamstress and they made some decent money for the first time.\n\nThey saved up that money... and bought a farm, and were relatively poor for the next 40 years. I'm not saying people have to chase after money in their lives, but it's a shame that all that effort put into farming never led to any success. But at least they found that success later in life.",

J. Howard Pew, a prominent donor, and advocate of unregulated capitalism, was friends with Lane and influenced the stories to promote individual self-sufficiency and discredit the role of government. The series is part of a broader cultural and religious propaganda apparatus constructed by free-market fundamentalists. The Big Myth draws attention to the strategic efforts by libertarian groups, such as bulk book purchases and distribution in schools, to promote Ayn Rand's works and Ronald Reagan's advocacy of free market fundamentalism. These revelations shed light on the influence of right-wing disinformation and the dissemination of free-market propaganda.",

Erdrich (who is Ojibwe) was much influenced by Wilder's books: her novels talk back to Wilder's in subtle ways, showing that the lands were not empty. Erdrich also takes pains to show Ojibwe foodways of the time, in part because she had enjoyed all the food scenes in Wilder's novels. Food sovereignty is still an important issue for the Ojibwe and many other indigenous peoples, and Erdrich's stories are wonderful in showing how they worked at the time and why they still matter.",

I loved the books as a kid, and I read all of them cover to cover multiple times (except \"Farmer Boy\", which was boring).  Anyway, I reread them a few years ago as an adult, and Rose's hardcore, libertarian views were plastered ALL over the series in a way that completely flew over my head as a kid.  It made it much harder for me to enjoy it when I knew Rose and Laura opposed the New Deal and believed those who were struggling during the Great Depression brought it on themselves.  I had no idea the books were so political until I did some research.",

Pa was a pioneer. Understanding that he was a pioneer, either by accident or by intention helps frame the experience.\n\nYour observations are valid, regardless of the pioneer bias, and if you thought that pioneers were settlers, it sure paints a different picture - because you can't be a pioneer and a settler - a settler might go to the forefront of the western expanstion and *settle*, but that is not what Pa does. He goes to the front, settles, then when others arrive, he ups and moves.\n\nWhats absolutely bonkers, is that if he had had an economic strategy, he could have made an absolute *killing*, literally prepping land for settlers, selling property and infrastructure in each location he'd previously settled.\n\nThey are a great series, but I agree completely that reading them as an adult is a grief-fest.",

I read the books aloud to my son when he was little, and as mom, and an adult, I kept having to interrupt to shout at\"Pa\"--- \"PA?  There are CITIES with running water, and electricity, and readily accessible health care.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN A DIRT HOLE IN THE SIDE OF A HILL.\"  \n\nHe dragged his poor wife and little girls off on these ridiculous misadventues.  Nearly starving them.  Bringing them into bear country.  Into Native American lands that were still under Native American control--they were invaders!   \n\nHE wanted to live the savage life and build his own house out of logs or whatever, which he wasn't even that good at, he built one of the houses so late in the season that it snowed into the house.  HE wanted to live somewhere that trains couldn't get to for six months because of the snow so they literally nearly starved to death, or somewhere that the blizzards were so fierce that you could die if you were even just six feet away from your house.   WHY BRING A WOMAN AND CHILDREN ALONG WITH YOU?   \n\nCaroline had to endure childbirth, having periods, presumably the girls had periods too, all kinds of illnesses, without any sort of help or any kind of medical care. ALL the struggles they had were totally because of his own whims and caprices.   I blame Mary's blindness on him, too.  Imagine if she'd just had medical care!  He was just so selfish!",

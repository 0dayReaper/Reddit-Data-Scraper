    "postText": "Hey guys, I've read a fair few of Saramago's books starting in school (in Portugal you read either Baltazar and Blimunda or the year of the death of Ricardo Reis in school) and quite a few afterwards. \nI've loved them all but this really stands out, it's the story of this lonely middle ages national registry clerk that accidentaly finds the file of a random women while researching information on famous people for his personal collection. He begins to get obesesed with finding the women and discovering who she is behind the bureaucracy reality. \nThe book is not only a deep exploration of loneliness of modern society and the alienation that work produces, but it's also and essay on identity, destiny and freedom, and in some points even life and death and it's borders.\nI'm curious to know what other people though of the book and I'm also curious to know how Saramago's distinctive style translates into English. I'm also curious to know how you guys interpeted the enigmatic ending.\n\nThank you!",

Also he was just really cool, a one eye wild poet constatly getting into fights is really cool. There is these portuguese poet called Ant\u00f4nio Aleixo who also had really great poems. I think he was a fisherman or something and he's poems are very simple he couldn't even write someone else wrote for him, but if you like popular poetry you might like him, I don't know if he's transleted tho.\nBut my favourite portuguese author is really Saramago",

I\u2019m originally from Namibia (I live in South Africa now) and the first Europeans to land there (albeit very briefly) were the Portuguese, so we\u2019re quite familiar with Vasco da Gama\u2019s voyage. You seldom ever get depictions of Southern Africa in classical literature, so it was a real joy to see depictions of my homeland treated by such a brilliant poet. It\u2019s now one of my absolute favourite epics and I can see why it\u2019s considered a national poem in Portugal.\n\nI\u2019ve just been looking up Saramago and now i\u2019m really excited to start reading him!

Coetzee and Damon Galgut are really good. Galgut won the Booker Prize a couple years ago with *The Promise* and Coetzee\u2019s *Disgrace* is quite famous outside of South Africa. Both are fantastic. Bryce Courtenay\u2019s *The Power of One* is less of a literary feat in my opinion, but it\u2019s one a lot of South Africans have grown up reading along with *Jock of the Bushveld*. *Tsotsi* is another fantastic book that got a movie adaption a few years ago that\u2019s equally good.",

Another portuguese writer, in that book he chose to write as if you were in the mind of the carachters so in some cases you would have phrases repeting in like every paragraph about kidney pain or something.

It started out engaging with its narrative style with Saramago including the character's perspective but also his perspective as the author as well as ours as the reader and then even the ceiling's perspective too. That was a good chuckle and I thought that this was a very inventive way to shed light from many corners and exercise a kind of narrative play that was fresh and kept you on your toes. This may have also been the driving reason for not using quotes to determine who is speaking, which can be a bit frustrating at times, but overall added color to what was being portrayed and allowed for a few false steps that made you check your assumptions.\n\nI was a bit shocked when the story took an unexpected turn and suspected a ruse but Saramago had something else altogether that he was trying to say in place of a neat and tidy ending. He had his sights on bigger horizons. As for what he was trying to say at the end with the Register, I was a bit confused. It didn't seem in keeping with the character's other actions throughout the book and I'm not sure it was a necessary catalyst.\n\nRegardless, I was invigorated at then end. Somewhat reminiscent of Kazantzakis' Zorba the Greek or even Steinbeck's East of Eden, it made me appreciate the day. And death? I suppose it needs a new cabinet for the files of persons that are never thought of again.",

    "postText": "Just finished the book recently and then watched the movie again to compare. Perhaps I'm missing something but it seems like the movie has diverged from the book when it comes to the relationship between Mina and Dracula. AFAIK, Mina has no romantic attachment so ever for Dracula. She despises him as an ordinary person would do to such a monster. Having a movie named after the book with this plot change should never have been considered an adaptation and should rather have been named something else other than the book's name.",

            "comment": "So virtually every Dracula adaptation should be renamed, because all of the most famous ones are arguably more inaccurate than even Coppola's? Also, including that romance is arguably a way to bring the erotic subtext behind the novel and the vampire mythos in general front and center. Artistic liberties in adaptations are a really great thing. It's an adaptation of Dracula, much of it is accurate, especially compared to Browning's most famous iteration, and it's a decent movie otherwise.",

I don't think anyone watches Coppola's film despite its title and thinks, man I know exactly what happened in Stoker's novel. I think the title was moreso to differentiate itself from previous adaptations. Dracula is still almost always designed in the image of Bela Lugosi, for example. Coppola's Dracula would, for most filmgoers, imply his own unique take on the better known cinematic Dracula. They'd be rather confused to see an old man as the titular vampire. That is not Coppola's invention.",

The broad consensus was that they should if there is proper research involved. Well, Stoker is the kind of clown that did no such thing &amp; until he wrote Dracula, he was a rather lamentable writer to begin with. Why this novel was received so well is beyond me.",

He was writing a fiction novel, a landmark in horror. \n\nIf you want to judge books by contemporary moral standards and insist that the appropriate cultural research should be done, then don't read 19th century fiction. Read something written in our era, where authors have to walk on their tippy-toes because someone's going to be offended.",

I argue that we're in an entirely different ballpark when we're appropriating a people's mythos &amp; folklore for commercial use, especially when we're misrepresenting it in rather questionable ways.\n\nThe concept of vampire/strigoi, which he simply mauled &amp; infused with weird sexual charge, long precedes his time in the Romanian population of the Carpathians &amp; various adjacent Slavic peoples, to the point where anthropological work &amp; understanding of the source material was easily accessible even in his time. The very role model of Dracula is misplaced in an adjacent political entity of the time with an erroneous title &amp; pandering to age-old Saxon propaganda. Yeah, most individuals don't have a bone in this misrepresentation to care, but Stoker could just as well have used the very rich Irish mythology to write his bestiality coded smut.",

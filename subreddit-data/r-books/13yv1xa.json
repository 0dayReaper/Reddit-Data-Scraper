The last time I visited one I managed to get a 1956 edition of \"Camp Six\" by Frank Smythe - the book is now long out of print, it seems, and I managed to get it for \u00a39.50, which is not really bad since good condition hard covers can easily reach twice that from what I've seen online.\n\nI also have a leatherbound version of \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" that I got for \u00a35, also from a secondhand bookstore about 10 years back.",

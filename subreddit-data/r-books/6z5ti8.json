The only thing I missed from the book was the \"magic\" that the kids believed in when confronting the monster. I'm afraid the \"adult\" movie won't convey the desperation they felt going back to fight because they don't believe in movie monsters and silver bullets anymore.",

This is the only time I saw that someone died of cancer and thought \"they deserved that! I hope they suffered\"...\n\n\nThe only major perp still alive is Paula, who was fired from her job as a teachers aid in 2012 after her past became know.  She was going by the name Paula Pace (married name) so they didn't make the connection at first apparently. Paula Marie Place still lives in Iowa and I am not going to dox her, since it's against the rules, but all I'm going to say is that Google is your friend and so is the Marshal County Assessor website.....

I wasn't able to outright identify what was bothering everyone but you could tell that everyone in the story had something they were dealing with. I think that Patrick wasn't inherently \"bad\", he was just more susceptible to the evilness (it sounds like he was struggling with a serious mental health disorder, and those who understand how a sociopathic mind works will know what I mean by him being more susceptible.) I think that what King is trying to bring to light is to what extent are we able to justify the death of a child? Do we label someone a \"bad person who deserves death\" a person who is simply unable to overcome/address their own issues? ",

While they may (or may not) serve their purposes storywise, they, more importantly, create a lingering sense of uneasiness in the reader and are in my opinion one of the pillars of SK writing style.\n\nIn a horror story about child murder you expect horrible child murder and you can mentally prepare for it lessening the intended effect. Then suddenly you get a child orgy - and even those of us who tend not to be emotionally engaged by books are left uneasy. Horror created, goal achieved.\n\nAnother example of this is the boss in the breaker village in the Dark Tower books. He is constantly squeezing and scratching his pimples and eating the pus. Still getting queasy just writing it!",

Then his older brother is hiding out at night to avoid the father and sees his dead little brother climbing out of the Canal. He's eventually caught by It as the Creature from the Black Lagoon and gets his head ripped off. Fucking horrific and tragic. ",

Hell, The Shining is basically King facing the fact that he was failing as a father during that period in his life. He also has stated he doesn't remember writing Cujo at all. It is just a blank spot in his memory. Legend has it he wrote The Running Man over a single weekend at a hotel; he locked himself in the room on a Friday, walked out on a Monday with a ~~400~~ 300 page book. A lot of people say his books took a hit when he got sober, but ever since Duma Key, he's been a producing some of his best work since the '70s and '80s. Maybe he's back on the booger sugar?",

The Stand TV mini series is a damn near perfect adaption, and I read that 1200 page version. I expected more to be explained!\n\nIn the end I'm more confused than ever. ",

I mean the entire book for me was about how kids always have this almost 6th sense when they know something is wrong or just doesn't fit in. And parents just sort of ignore it because they think its our imagination. But this time something bad is happening and the adults, who usually are almost immortal in kids eyes, do nothing but stand by and watch. \n\nThats why when this scene does happen for me it stood as the kids finally becoming adults and understanding that this world isnt all fairy tails like it used to be to them. I think I might be wrong but its my interpretation. ",

Most people are so busy running a train on the plot that they completely ignore the story's luxurious thread count and how the soft lighting bounces perfectly off its ass.\n\n\nThe book's theme is \"it.\" The \"it\" that children aren't supposed to know about and that adults don't want to think about.\n&gt; Did you hear that Bobby and Susy are doing *it*?\n\n&gt; My dad hasn't been back from getting smokes and *it's* not something my mom wants to talk about\n\n&gt; I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT *IT*\n\n&gt; *It* isn't something I want to talk about right now\n\nThis is even why the children name the creature as \"IT\" and continue to address it as such while adults. They don't know wtf *IT* really is and they really don't want to remember or talk about **it**. The creature is the personification of *it*; the deadlights are the spacial representation of *it*.\n\n\nAt the end, in the '58 sewers, they hadn't truly beaten IT but Beverly knew they had to somehow beat **it** to continue. They couldn't just sit around and talk about sex, they knew nothing about sex, the entire concept was still *it*. The creature's power was over those who accepted \"*it*\" as a societal norm. They beat IT and then they had to beat *it*. And for people who say Bev got used, fuck you, Bev beat the shit out of **it** (practically by herself) twice in one night.\n\n\nAs adults they first had to beat *it* in their homes and minds before they could leave to beat IT. Stan just couldn't get it up the second time around.",

We forget what we used to do as children, how we used to feel and think and more often than not, it frighten us.\n\nWhy is that? \n\nMaybe we lost our ability to perceive the innocence of children. To Beverly, it wasn't a gangbang or a train or any other derogatory term meant to accuse and shame the reader. It was the sacrifice of their own innocence to emerge from their own tragedy and survive into adulthood. \n\n",

I never realized the title has such a pervasive importance to the theme, thank you. And the scene now makes quite a lot of sense to me. In order to avoid leaving the tunnels still ignorant of what *it* is Bev realized they had to confront *it* directly in order not to shy away and grow up as other adults do. Since as kids sex would be the big taboo that was the thing they needed to confront to leave the tunnels with the ability to see. It ties in with the imagery of sexual perversion throughout the book, and how it's a scary thing to children and adults get really screwed up about it. In a weird way it was the only action they could take at this point to dispel the mystery of *it* for themselves, since they already confronted the other sorts of *it* children might fear, such as darkness and monsters.\n\nExcellent analysis, sir.

The passage of that border is usually sex, and losing your virginity is the stamp in your passport that lets you know that you are no longer a child (sexual maturity, in most cultures, occurs around 12 or 13 years old).

He is always ready to admit when something in his books was a result of something in his personal life. He has openly admitted that Cujo would likely not exist without his cocaine addiction he had at the time, and that Misery was about him trying to escape his addiction. I think it's just a result of his brilliant but really weird mind.",

Basically if that guy in the van hadn't hit him while walking, he would never have finished the series, and he's completely open about that. And about how he put the guy in one of the books as an unsavory character, to say the least. ",

While watching the movie I couldn't fathom why parents brought kids under 16 along to see it. Not a typical horror film. If you're a fan I highly recommend reading the book. Way more frightening than the films. That particular scene is extremely uncomfortable to read along with Henry screwing a sheep and ejaculating on a birthday cake. Mr. King was fxcked up writing this masterpiece. ",

It literally saves their lives.\n\nI love a lot of King's work, and think he's a thoughtful, intelligent man. This, though...can he *really* not see why this is different?",

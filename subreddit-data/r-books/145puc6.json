    "postText": "Heyo! So super big fan of Harlan Coben. Fav book so far is The Innocent. I just finished the Match and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it. It\u2019s obviously written well, couldn\u2019t put it down. But I\u2019m hung up on some things lol like did it ever mention if Wilde worked at all? Parts of the story don\u2019t seem realistic,so my logical mind is like how is he living life? \ud83e\udd23 I finished the book in just a couple of days so it definitely had my attention. Just don\u2019t know about it overall lol let me know if you liked it!",

He seems to be wonderful at creating multiple twists and turns throughout the story that keep you guessing, but I didn\u2019t feel that same way with this story. \nAnd my favourite is also The Innocents!",

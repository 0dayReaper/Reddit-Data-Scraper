    "postText": "Macbeth is the shortest, bloodiest and by far most exciting play Shakespeare has to offer, and I feel like despite its presence in the school system (England) people don\u2019t really realise it\u2019s ingenuity.\n\nSeriously, it\u2019s arguably one of the first stories ever written to truly focus on the psyche, the *why* of characters. Macbeth isn\u2019t some evil, 2D character, he really struggles with the thought of regicide, a strong theme in relation to the great chain of being, convincing himself that he doesn\u2019t need to kill to claim the throne initially but eventually, with Lady Macbeth\u2019s persuasion, he executes the unforgivable sin of murdering a King (Maybe a few decades too early) and it\u2019s here, the aftermath of such an obscene act, that the play truly flourishes, as Macbeth descends deeper into his tyrannical madness, a consequence of his reliance on the unnatural witches, who themselves even begin to see Macbeth as wicked.\n\nAnd all it comes to a crashing end with his overconfidence ultimately being his demise, as his kingdom built on blood falls apart under its own wickedness; \u201cAll the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this here spot,\u201d Lady Macbeth says in her final soliloquy, and in my favourite quote of all, remarks that \u201cWhat\u2019s done can not be undone;\u201d a terrible realisation echoing from an earlier sentiment in the play- \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done.\u201d It comes full circle, the true scale and horror of her actions have set in, which are all too much for her as she eventually takes her own life.\n\nAnd to end with, since this is way longer than I expected, my favourite soliloquy- \u201cTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.\u201d  I interpret this as the effect of godlessness on Macbeth, stemming from killing God\u2019s appointed regent on Earth, as early as from when he was unable to say amen. He is resigned in this speech, somber and almost nihilist; psychologically, what with Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, and Banquo\u2019s long line of kings shown earlier, perhaps he has acknowledged his fallibility, even if none of woman born can harm Macbeth, what toll has it taken on his person? What kingdom is there left to rule?\n\nThis play is really quite spectacular, a classic tragedy, the fall from grace of a once noble servant to a tyrannical, immoral usurper. Really, read this play. It\u2019ll take hardly half an hour but it\u2019ll be worth all the more.\n\n(BTW, I tried to post this on literature but it didn\u2019t work? Anyone know what\u2019s up with that?)",

I mean, the word \"psyche\" is literally the name of a mythological story character.\n\nBut more specifically, the Illiad has long monologues all about the why, the psychological state of the characters, and a critique of their society.\n\nElektra is a play that predates Macbeth by more than a thousand years that's basically all people agonizing over the why and their psychological torment until the main character finally murders her husband.\n\nIf you haven't seen Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth *Ran* though, it's one of the greatest movies of all time. Also Patrick Stewart's version is fantastic.",

Marlowe had psychological elements to his works and was a large influence on Shakespeare, so it\u2019s not like Shakespeare independently came up with the idea of focusing on a character\u2019s psychology. In english literature you can go even earlier with something like The Green Knight, which is very psychological. In Japan you have the Tale of Genji which several academics consider to be a psychological work. I would argue The Iliad also has a lot of psychological elements, particularly PTSD, and it is one of the most influential works of all time. All of these were very influential on the development of character psychology even if they\u2019re not household names anymore. Shakespeare was very popular and had a massive influence on literature, but we\u2019re also biased in that he is the only person most people recognize from that time. He\u2019s definitely one of the pioneers, and I would say the most well known, but I think saying he kickstarted it is not accurate.",

            "comment": "I preface this by saying I'm no longer teaching (US). However, this is *exactly* what I loved about reading this book with angsty middle schoolers. I'm a theater kid at heart, beyond just my training in literature, and so I would really try to help them lean into the performance aspects of the play. I think the most important part of this story is inhabiting the \"space\" of the story. By inhabiting the space - physical, emotional, and psychological - you gain a different kind of perspective on Macbeth himself as well as all of the other characters that exist in his story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Macduff's \"but I must feel it as a man\" ranks high in my favorite lines of all time.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy  background in literary analysis is mostly in discussing the way literature illustrates psychological experiences. (I mostly focused on The Inklings, but I dabbled elsewhere.) I've found that Shakespeare in general, but especially in *Macbeth*, does a phenomenal job of exploring the human psyche's downward spirals, but also its resilience. Thus, as other commenters have mentioned, I'm not sure it \"kickstarted\" the psychological genre as such, that honor *likely* goes to *Oedipus Rex* or perhaps, to some extent, even *The Epic of Gilgamesh,* but I would go so far as to say it has inspired/ kickstarted the psychological genre of the modern era. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suppose what I mean by that is, like many modern authors in the psychological genre, Shakespeare digs into more than one point of view. While the story, obviously, centers on Macbeth, Shakespeare has several characters (Lady Macbeth, Macduff, and, to some extent, Malcolm all come to mind) that also have fully developed psyches. I think that's part of what makes it feel so real when you watch well done productions of *Macbeth* or read it. Macduff beautifully foils Macbeth in the sense that Macduff represents psychological resilience where Macbeth is crumbling under the weight of his guilt. I think what sets Macbeth a part from things like *Oedipus Rex* and other older works that focus on the human psyche is that very little is done \"off screen.\" Macbeth communicates to the audience directly his struggle, his decent into madness, and his tyranny. There is little of Macbeth's downfall that is left to the imagination, and there is little of Macduff's rise to heroism that is shown off screen. In a short number of words, Shakespeare manages to communicate two completely different stories about the human mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a topic that is endlessly fascinating to me because how Shakespeare manages to communicate the psychological struggles of his characters is so profound. Macbeth is a heroic man whose poor choices end in his guilt-ridden downfall. His wife brought him down to her level and, in turn, she is brought down with him. However, Macduff raises up Malcolm and, in raising him up, raises himself through his grief. GAH! Now I want to go back and read *Macbeth* again.",

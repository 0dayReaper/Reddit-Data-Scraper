    "postText": "You were reading your own auto-biography? I'm not into reading books for solidarity, but, when I read White Oleander by Janet Fitch, I often felt like I was reading my own diary. I would think to myself, yeah...I've thought exactly that before and that and that and that. Other times, even though I hadn't had the same thought, I had thought something so very similar. My life had different, but similar circumstances and it was very interesting to see how a character could experience the same thoughts born from different situations.\n\nHas that ever happened to you? If so, what is your fictional auto-biography?",

I mean, imagine you came across Gilbert from What's Eating Gilbert Grape? I'm sure he would say that nothing had every happened in his life. But, other people see it differently. Have you ever heard of the author Andy Andrews? He has a book called The Noticer. I find that it's best on audible because it's so good listening to him tell his own story, but the book is about changing your perspective. Maybe it might help you look at things a bit differently. ;)",

My boyfriend's mum used to gush about her and even my boyfriend still spoke highly of her and it all made me feel really uncomfortable.\n\nIt's insane how accurately the MC's jealousy and insecurities were written because it's exactly how I felt. The way people spoke about Rebecca, the way MC felt so inadequate, Max's blindness to the whole situation. I've never felt so seen by a book before. There are so many small details in the book that can only have been written by someone's who's experienced a similar situation before.",

I am actually sorry about your situation. I know that had to be difficult. My first \"adult\" boyfriend was a...widow?? That's not right. His girlfriend had died. He had so much of her stuff in his closet and he wouldn't talk about her and it felt like she was still his girlfriend....and I was like...the other woman-ish?\n\nI love to go this antique mall we have here and I came across the book, 'Mrs de Winter' by Susan Hill. Have you read that one? It's the sequel. I'm just curious if it is/would be similar to your experience as well. It didn't get very good reviews, but I want to read it anyway. I wonder if it was like when Alexandra Ripley wrote the sequel to Gone With the Wind and everyone hated that as well. That is a tall order to continue someone's story like that. It's interesting that Mrs de Winter was written shortly after Scarlett. I wonder if that's where she got the idea?",

    "postText": "Well, the first thing I'd love to know is what everyone thought of them. I gather from what I've read online that the sequels don't have the best reputation. I greatly disliked reading about the dynamics between the human beings in the colony within Rama: it felt like it stopped being science fiction.\n\nBut I do understand what the authors were going for. The exploration of space was an exploration of what it meant to be a human being, and the authors give a largely bleak answer to that question.\n\nBut I had another question. What *really* happened in *Rama II* when Rama seemed to move while the captain of the Newton was being operated on? It's a huge mystery, it seemed to me, in that book but I couldn't piece together what happened.\n\nMy understanding was that Rama moved jarringly at a crucial moment during the operation concerning the captain's apparent (but faked) appendicitis. This movement basically doomed the captain. It led many of the characters to speculate that Rama was alive, etc., and I am so curious whether there are any answers to this question.",

Standard advice is not to bother with them. I believe they were almost entirely written by Lee, and Clarke just seeded some ideas and gave his name to the project. \n\nI remember not being impressed by the way things devolved into an incestuous soap opera. And also wasn't impressed with the conclusion. Some questions are better left unanswered.",

I basically despised the social dynamics within the human colony *so much*. I am so stunned by what a weird turn the series took in that respect.",

But understandable and temporary vigilante justice can morph into a culturally solidified lynch-mob habit, in which the available mode of justice is thrown out the window. . .*\n\n*The #MeToo moment is a symptom of a broken legal system. All too frequently, women and other sexual-abuse complainants couldn't get a fair hearing through institutions \u2013 including corporate structures \u2013 so they used a new tool: the internet. Stars fell from the skies. This has been very effective, and has been seen as a massive wake-up call. But what next? The legal system can be fixed, or our society could dispose of it . . . If the legal system is bypassed because it is seen as ineffectual, what will take its place? Who will be the new power brokers? . . . In times of extremes, extremists win. Their ideology becomes a religion; anyone who doesn't puppet their views is seen as an apostate, a heretic or a traitor, and moderates in the middle are annihilated. Fiction writers are particularly suspect because they write about human beings, and people are morally ambiguous. The aim of ideology is to eliminate ambiguity.*",

It tends to kick in during the \"Terror and Virtue\" phase of revolutions \u2013 something has gone wrong, and there must be a purge, as in the French Revolution, Stalin's purges in the USSR, the Red Guard period in China, the reign of the Generals in Argentina and the early days of the Iranian Revolution. The list is long and Left and Right have both indulged. Before \"Terror and Virtue\" is over, a great many have fallen by the wayside. Note that I am not saying that there are no traitors or whatever the target group may be; simply that in such times, the usual rules of evidence are bypassed.\n\nBut to be fair she does not waste one word.

I support that unequivocally. At face value, most women would likely agree with the sentiment.  Then you introduce a woman who's chosen to be one of those \"traditional\" roles femnists are told to break away from, be it a nurse, or a teacher, or a stay-at-home mom, or, god forbid, a stripper.\n\nIt's strange to see self-avowed feminists claim to adhere to the principles of womanly autonomy, then crucify someone for making a choice they, themselves, don't agree with.  I may not agree with the choice that's made, but I 100% agree that the choice is the woman's to make.  Maybe that's splitting a hair.  Maybe it's a hair that needs splitting.",

How is that even possible, if there are no Bad People? It must be Good People doing these bad things. We have to be on the lookout for the circumstances that circumvent or hijack our natural urge to be Good People, and be humble enough to know that we too could \"follow our instincts\" into a mindset where we do bad things, despite our good intentions.\n\nThese are the things that spring to mind for me; it won't be an exhaustive list. Feel free to add.\n\n* **The \"following orders\" effect:** The decision that will cause harm is separated from the hand that will enact it by a command structure that privileges following orders above exercising individual judgement or compassion. Giving actors electric shocks, yada yada.\n\n* **The positive feedback/escalating revenge effect:** if you sit two kids down and tell one to hit the other very lightly, and the other one to hit him back equally lightly, and then vice versa, pretty soon they'll be wailing on each other, because we naturally receive hurt more harshly than we deal it out. This is why de-escalation techniques are so important for everyone from law-enforcement to anxiety sufferers to social activists. Positive feedback loops create unstable systems; it's as true in life as it is in mechanical engineering.\n\n* **The monkey-sphere effect:** we have a group of people that matter to us (about 150), and everybody else just isn't quite as real to us. Harming people outside of our monkey-sphere in order to help somebody within our monkey-sphere feels morally OK to us up to a certain level of harm/benefit, which varies by individual. It can be argued that there are different tiers of monkey-spheres inside and outside of that 150; family, sports fandom, race and religion, etc. A sociopath might have a monkey-sphere of 1.\n\nThese are just some of the dynamics that make objectively harmful actions seem morally acceptable to the person enacting them. This is where things like a legal system or systems of morality like religions are useful; an eye for an eye is actually de-escalation if your instinct is to kill the whole other tribe in return for wounding your son.\n\nedit: I added \"or hijack\" to the introductory paragraph because it's a dynamic that deserves to be pointed out, and \"to social activists\" to the positive feedback paragraph because first hand experience, and topically relevant.\n",

Not that that in and of itself is bad, it's just fascinating to look at this phenomenon as the new church, where people find their morality and communities, and we all tune in for the Two Minute Hate each week. Add to that the woker-than-thou pissing contest/litmus test culture and you've got the makings of a religion. If people can be destroyed or banished for perceived heresy, you're gonna have a bad time. ",

It's about women developing a power like an electrical eel that allows them to defend themselves and it starts revolutions around the world. It's very feminist book but it's also a very humanist book because it shows how power corrupts everyone. A lot of women use the power in the book to terrorize and rape. I'm not sure how much I agree with everything the book had to say, but it was a very interesting and very difficult read.",

And, ladies, I want you to win this fight. Ten years ago I might have been scared, but, you know, I got a daughter now. So if you win, she wins. So I\u2019m rooting for you. And I agree with you. At least, ideologically, I do. I don\u2019t know if the\u2013 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing it right, but I mean, who am I to say? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong.

What this city really needs\u2026 Without irony, I\u2019ll say this. The cure for LA is in South Africa. You motherfuckers need truth and reconciliation with one another. Because the end of apartheid should have been a fucking bloodbath by any metric in human history, and it wasn\u2019t. The only reason it wasn\u2019t is because Desmond Tutu and Mandela and all these guys figured out that **if a system is corrupt, then the people who adhere to the system and are incentivized by that system are not criminals. They are victims, and the system itself must be tried, but because of how systems work is so compartmentalized as far as information , the only way we can figure out what the system is is if everybody says what they did.** Tell him how you participated.

I was having a conversation with a different co-worker when she interjected with something that could be taken as flirting. I shot her down so there was no mistaking I wasn\u2019t interested (or without being crude). The next day, I was called into HR and \u201csuspended pending investigation\u201d for sexual harassment. Eight unpaid workdays later, I was brought back and written up for inappropriate conversations in the workplace. The accuser faced no consequences. \n\nMy witness (the co-worker I was talking to) was threatened with termination if he \u201clied to protect\u201d me. It\u2019s still on deep background checks that I was accused of sexual harassment, even if it wasn\u2019t sustained. It\u2019s a black mark just to be accused. \n\nI could have done with some due process there. ",

He was in a relationship at the time (and still is in the same one) and so he attempted to keep some distance between the two of them. Eventually things escalated. She started sending him unsolicited nudes, which he wasn't sure how to deal with as they still had to work with one another and he didn't want to encourage the behavior, but he also didn't want to do something that may jeopardize his job if he retaliated too hard and she went of the deep end. She would openly disparage his girlfriend, whom she'd never met, in front of him. He once sent a group message to our house that she'd somehow gotten our address and to please tell her he wasn't home if she came knocking. At some point, he told his manager he didn't want any more shifts at the same time as her. Eventually he managed to get the message across to her that he wasn't interested and things calmed down relatively smoothly.\n\nI myself have had a relationship with a young woman that turned very toxic very quickly. I literally have a message saved on my phone from her where she admits to lying to me about how drunk she was so that I'd have sex with her and then, months later, she sent me a message accusing me of rape over the issue because I'd seen her at a bar the night before and I warned the guy she was with to be careful. To this day, the thought of her reporting something terrifies me even though I luckily have enough evidence to clear my name.\n\nThere are some terrible people in the world and some of them happen to be women. I'm all for finding solutions to the sexual assault issues plaguing our country, but the unfettered veracity with which people are willing to believe and stand by any woman who makes an accusation of sexual misconduct scares the shit out of me, especially when the definition of sexual misconduct seems to be changing day to day. Some sharks are so thirsty for blood that they'll cut themselves in order to cry foul.",

He experienced extreme politics, and had this to say:\n\n&gt; Words had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal supporter; prudent hesitation equalled specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for weakness; ability to see all sides of a question incapacity to act on any. Frantic violence became the attribute of strength; cautious plotting a justifiable means of self-defense. The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected. To succeed in a plot was to have a shrewd head, to divine a plot a still shrewder; but to try to provide against having to do either was to break up your party and to be afraid of your adversaries. In short, to prevent a crime, or to suggest the idea of a crime where there was none was equally commended.\n\nYou know that saying about folk who don't know history are condemned to repeat it?\n\nWe are living that just now, and not just the whole #metoo stuff.

Plus it seems to come in waves - I grew up in the 70s/80s, and the Cold War, and subsequent collapse of the Berlin Wall installed a mood of optimism the seemed to drive the 90s.\n\nThen 9/11 happened, and all the political lies, violence and death that arose from that. So many folk seem to have lost hope and moved to more extreme, less thoughtful positions, and our politicians latch on to that to get elected. We are in a reactionary wave, the way the 70s was.

Only when they see the same shit happen in their own lifetime as has happened throughout history - do they stop to wonder at the continuity running through all human history. It is an unfortunately intuitive delusion that our time is somehow isolated, that our own suffering is somehow separate.\n\nThe only answer I can think of is to introduce history, politics and philosophy at an early age in school so that children realise how connected we all are, and that people have been dealing with the same human urges and weaknesses since time immemorial.\n",

Due process is ambiguous in all but a legal context, where it is spelled out explicitly. So if you are talking about something extrajudicial, due process is by definition not going to be applicable, or at least, it will be whatever people want it to be in that particular moment. Take for example Eliza Dushku's accusation. Joel Kramer has been let go by his talent agency and will probably never work again. There is likely no legal recourse for Dushku; did Kramer get due process? Should he have? Should his agency be required to do its own investigation before dropping him or can they drop him just because they want to? There is nothing illegal they did.\n\nAziz Ansari was accused of sexual misconduct. People are coming down on both sides of the alleged incident, but no illegality was claimed. So is Netflix free to cancel his show anyway? Yes. Are they free to renew his show anyway? Yes. They can do whatever they want, and \"due process\" does not factor into this equation at all.\n\nSo when we speak of due process outside of a legal, constitutional process and imperative, what are we actually talking about?",

She is also not decrying and talking down #MeToo. She is stating that #MeToo and other similar trends are a result of a broken, non-functioning legal system that is not operating fairly. Because of this, women are bypassing it altogether and using a different tool--the internet. This tool is working to some degree.. at least right now, but is definitely dangerous to the already faltering legal system, because the end result might be to completely abandon the notion of institutionalized justice in favor of an accusational, online vigilantism. She postulates that if no attempt is made at reform or improvement, then we will have a power structure that caters to the loudest and most extreme.\n\n\n\nIn other words, #MeToo should ideally be channeled into a robust reform of policing and law, so as to better serve the victims and the accused, and to arrive at conclusions that are fair in the eyes of the law and the people. America has greatly lagged behind other countries in doing this, so it's unsurprising that #MeToo rose up. If people had faith in a system that worked, we would never have gotten these 5, 10, 20 year later accusations and revelations, because they would have been reported to the police and dealt with fairly. What does it say about our system that people don't even try to get justice because they've already written off the system?",

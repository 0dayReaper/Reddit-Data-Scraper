    "postText": "I saw there was a post about this, but it was from five years ago, so I thought it's probably old enough for a re-do.\n\nI'm thinking from a speculative fiction point of view (specifically things like urban fantasy), what do you prefer? (Obviously nonfiction is a completely different kettle of fish)\n\nI have some thoughts, but I don't know where exactly I fall on this.\n\nIf it's a real city, it can help ground the setting and give it a sense of realism. However, the pitfalls can be that any details that aren't 100% accurate (geographically or otherwise) can break suspension of disbelief for people from those areas. I haven't read it, but I did see someone point out that in the *Divergent* series there's a real-world lake that's just plain missing which would have huge implications for the setting. I guess any readers who haven't been to this particular place probably wouldn't notice or care about this sort of thing, though. On a slightly different note, I've also read that a lot of readers are sick of \"the same\" locations being used again and again (e.g. aliens always invade New York City). I wonder if those readers would prefer to read something based in Melbourne, Australia or Auckland, New Zealand as a change of pace?\n\nIf it's a fictional city, it can solve the problem of \"the same locations again and again\", however it can also break immersion because the existence of this place would have huge ramifications on the country as a whole (and its history). For towns or smaller settlements this isn't as much of an issue (there are SO MANY that adding an extra one wouldn't affect much). Now, there's no one agreed upon, universal definition of city (based on population size), but if we look at cities with at least a million people, Australia has 5 and New Zealand has only 1. Adding in a fictional city of one million people completely changes the makeup of a country. Even the USA has only 10 cities of this size. Although, when it comes to comic books, I think everyone's used to the idea of Gotham City and Metropolis and doesn't find that too unrealistic?\n\nIf it's an unspecified city, I think it can give a sense of universality, that these events could be taking place anywhere. However, I've heard some readers get irritated by not knowing where a place is and try to piece it together with context clues and can't work it out.\n\nI don't actually know where I fall on this. Most of the fiction I consume takes place in secondary worlds, so this isn't something I normally think about, but it's something I realised I don't know what other people think and wanted to find out.\n\nWhat do you think? Also, do you think readers of spec. fic. prefer to read books set in their own country, or foreign ones?\n\nEdit: The upvote/downvote ratio on this post seems to indicate this is a controversial post but I have no idea why.",

I think authors draw on the familiarity that readers have with known places to create grounding, nostalgia, or the shock of a familiar place becoming suddenly unfamiliar. Other authors invent places to lift readers out of the familiar; novel places suit novel concepts and ideas. An android in New York creates a different reading experience than an android on Planet X. So for me the only answer is as it always is, how do the elements hold together for intended impact.",

That information the setting's tone and flavor, and with some basic research can teach the reader about a new place. The risk of putting off residents is minimal. \n\nFor the future or past, where things can get nebulous, something fictional or general is fine. That's also true for very rural areas: there might not BE a small town with everything the author needs for the story, so going with a general region and taking bits and pieces from lots of towns is fine. This generally happens if they have personal knowledge of the area and are confident they can represent it faithfully.",

Where it would be impossible for me to visit and say, \"Hey, I remember that place from that book I read.\" \n\nThat stretch of time differs based on the culture. For American cities, especially those outside of the east coast, there's barely anything left from more than 100 years ago. Whereas so e places in Europe and Asia might have landmarks that are 1000 years old or older. \n\nFor example, The Windup Girl takes place in Bangkok a century or two in the future, after environmental collapse has made the ocean level rise above the city itself. A system of dams and pumps keeps the city safe, and everyone has to use environmentally safe technology (what's left of it) like bicycles and genetically-engineered power-generating animals to prevent further catastrophe. The setting could have been almost any coastal city, but the Thai culture (as well as characters from nearby Asian countries) gives the setting an incredibly distinct flavor.",

Setting a novel in a real world setting can add a feeling of realism and place to otherwise fantastical events, and it can allow for commentary through the setting based on existing trends and ideas associated with such places (e.g. the fact that Three Body Problem is set in Communist China is a big deal for the ideas the novel talks about).\n\nIf it's a completely made up setting it can allow for more creative worldbuilding on the part of the writer, but it can also lessen the relevance of the physical cities and spaces themselves. For example, in N.K. Jemisin's Fifth Season, the city that is destroyed at the beginning of the novel isn't really important; just that its a placeholder for human development and progress, but the actual details and layout of it don't matter in the slightest.\n\nSo I think it depends on the function a setting serves!",

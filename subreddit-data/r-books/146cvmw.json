    "postText": "Incredible book, incredible characterization. I almost put it down since the beginning is slow to start but I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s super interesting and much more demented than I expected, I had just reread Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn and was looking for something well written and dark to move onto next. It\u2019s very suspenseful and there\u2019s a lot of detailed clues, imagery and symbolism. When you look back and reflect you notice so many little details that are tied into everything else. Even the color of the wallpaper. I\u2019m moving onto The Brothers Karamazov next, this book has definitely made me a Dostoevsky fan. \n\nStop here if you don\u2019t want to read anything about the book, I\u2019m going to discuss a scene. It\u2019s not directly related to the main narrative since it\u2019s a dream/flashback so I\u2019m not tagging this as spoiler, but if you are intent in going in completely blind click off! It also includes discussion of animal abuse/death. \n\nThere is a scene where Raskolnikov dreams of his childhood, where a group of people stand around and jeer while a horse is being beaten to death in the middle of the road. The owner demands the old horse carries a far too heavy load, more and more people load onto the horse and laugh as it buckles. As punishment, he violently continuously beats it. Bystanders cry out in disbelief, shame, contempt, but do nothing to stop the monster from beating his horse since it\u2019s his property. Raskolnikov as a child runs towards the horse and kisses its dead face, weeping and his father rips him away. The reasoning? It\u2019s really none of their business. I found this scene to be a powerful reflection of the apathy our society propagates, the cruelty and sickness. Here Raskolnikov is still a pure child, capable of empathy. This moment is a turning point for him, a realization that the world cares and stops for no one. That the innocent and compliant will be tortured.",

It has deep symbolism in russian culture. Society often seems to be divided on so many matters, name symbolizes it. Or it can be the other way around: protagonist separates himself from the rest of people, regarding them of inferior quality; and he feels injustice that how such a great man as himself can live such a miserable life and so he decides to prove that he deserves more.",

Brothers Karamazov, I find, is a very different kind of book. You still get the detailed examination of characters but it is far more diverse. Whilst in CAP you only really get fully immersed in Razkolnikov, in BK there are 4-5 'main characters' all of whom are completely different. \n\nI started reading it probably about a month ago now and didn't realise at the time what I was getting into. It is incredibly heavy and at times a difficult read. This, for me, has likely been accentuated by the fact that I'm currently in the middle of my final school exams, which, in hindsight, was not the best timing to read such a difficult book. I finish my study every evening at around 9 30, exhausted, only to have to take on this behemoth of a book. But I love it. Its an incredible book. I have the feeling that it is one of those books that I will finish and almost immediately read it again. Especially since I've likely overlooked a lot of the hidden details since I'm practically brain dead while reading. \n\nI'd recommend to read it quite slowly. It's not a book you can skim over or rush through. Quite a few times I've had to re-read chapters in order to fully grasp whats being said, and even then I'm often still lost. Hope you enjoy it as much as I am.",

    "postText": "Ok..this is not recommendation post but more like a discussion post. However please help yourself and read this Indian classic by R.K. Narayan. A very unconventional love story between a logical and traditional painter and Daisy, who's zealous about population control and is very cold and ruthless. Onto spoiler part\n\n&gt;!As I mentioned, I felt really sad after the ending. Daisy have became my favourite narayan character , only second to vasu. I was hoping that things work out. Ultimately they don't. But I still found it sweet. I still don't know whether I like the ending or not. But the way Narayan made me root for obviously mismatched couple and then broke my heart is going to stay with me. My favourite Indian classic probably.!&lt;",

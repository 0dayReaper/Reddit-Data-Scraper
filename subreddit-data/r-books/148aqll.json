Allow us to introduce you to our new Simple Questions thread!  Twice a week, every Tuesday and Saturday, a new Simple Questions thread will be posted for you to ask anything you'd like.  And please look for other questions in this thread that you could also answer!  A reminder that this is not the thread to ask for book recommendations.  All book recommendations should be asked in /r/suggestmeabook or our Weekly Recommendation Thread.\n        \nThank you and enjoy!",

There are a lot of clues in the text to get an idea of it but I was wondering if someone has compiled one yet or if there is an unofficial consensus on the order of events. I am on Part four of the book, and I am really enjoying it so far - however, I feel like I might get a better idea of the emotions being conveyed and the story overall if I was aware of how the different parts connected to each other.",

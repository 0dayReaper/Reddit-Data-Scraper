    "postText": "Hi Reddit, I\u2019m Craig Alanson and I used to create financial reports for a large IT services company. Writing fiction at nights and on weekends, I finally independently published three novels on Amazon. Within 6 months of my first ebook release, I was able to quit my day job and pursue a full-time writing career. \n\n\nThe breakout success of Expeditionary Force, Book 1: [Columbus Day](https://www.audible.com/pd/Columbus-Day-Audiobook/B01N48VJFJ) reached new heights when Podium Audio released it in audio format, narrated by Audie Award Winner [R.C. Bray](https://www.facebook.com/hisbrayness). The Columbus Day audiobook was a huge hit, and a finalist for an Audie Award as Audiobook of the Year. The ExForce series, as it is known to fans, has gone on to 15 books, many of which have hit the Audible and New York Times bestseller lists. Last year, I began publishing a thrilling series that melds action-packed urban fantasy with his signature humor called Convergence. Book 2, [Dragonslayer](https://www.audible.com/pd/Dragonslayer-Audiobook/B0BVDPGHJS) released last week, so I\u2019m excited to answer all of your burning questions about the Convergence series here tonight!\n\nHere's a short summary of Dragonslayer: \"The enemy unknowingly opened a portal to the Netherworld, and our world\u2019s only wizard somehow managed to close it. Unfortunately, something got through. Something big. A dragon. Will Kaz Wolfe, with help from his dog Duke who is channeling the spirit of a wizard from ancient Babylon, and with no help from Azib the Cowardly Genie, find the dragon before someone gets a cellphone video of the thing, and before the world learns that magic is real?\"\n\n[Listen](https://www.audible.com/series/Convergence-Audiobooks/B0B125D8G8) to Convergence on Audible. \n\n[Read](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B834DD74) Convergence on Kindle.\n\n[Listen](https://www.audible.com/series/Expeditionary-Force-Audiobooks/B01N9CUGHG) to ExForce on Audible.\n\n[Read](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7T8NPK) ExForce on Kindle. \n\nSign up for my newsletter [here](https://podiumaudio.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b8112948e51f817dfe82bf83c&amp;id=7434418a99&amp;fbclid=IwAR31_V-diekCAqdTjylO-DXeba0VC8eCHw2VPOEOi73tOKRAiTrGlLraSE0).\n\n[Follow me](https://www.facebook.com/Craig.Alanson.Author) on Facebook. \n\nPROOF: https://i.redd.it/ta32fnk10o4b1.jpg",

Was that your intent all along, or did the feel/theme transition organically as you put pen to paper?",

ExForce is really the first story where I can tell the author is making an effort to show that people from different backgrounds and cultures come together to serve in the military. Thank-you!",

Also, can you hire an artist and/or ExForce fan who's an artist so we can get a visualization of how you think the characters look? I think that'd be a lot of fun. Thank you for continuing the ExForce series, the (current) ending left me..... bothered. So I'm very excited to hand over my Audible credits for those future releases!",

It sounds like this coalition is still in it's infancy and very fragile, but any hints it could lead into a galactic peace keeping force down the future?  \n\nAnd Second not sure if anyone has brought it up but how did Skippy get from needing a ship to be able to just move around, to Skippy getting his memories then just leaves by himself, just something that's been in the back of my mind that didn't add up?",

I assume you are no longer self published, so at what point did that change and what was the main driving force for that? and once that happened, how different was the money? \n\nseems like self publishing is almost the way to go now, so just curious any other important thoughts you have about it, thanks!",

Being self-pubbed means I write whatever I want, publish on my schedule, and keep a lot more of the $.\nSelf-publishing is not for everyone but it has worked great for me. With Convergence, a major publisher wanted to sign me to a deal, but we couldn't make it work. They wanted much shorter books, and only one book per year.",

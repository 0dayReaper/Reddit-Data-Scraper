    "postText": "I've been on a 19th century horror classics marathon since past May. I'm now five books in. I read Phantom of The Opera and Frankenstein (godtier book) and decided to go for Dracula next, but since I've read an abridged version of it before and knew the general synopsis of the story, I decided to do a short trilogy about vampires instead. Working my way through and finishing off with Dracula since it came out last. There was also Varney The Vampire but I heard it was really long and not that good, if you've read it, tell me how it is. Maybe I'll read it sometime in the distant future when I'm bored.\n\n**FIRST**: I went and read Carmilla by Sheridan La Fanu. This book is THICC with gothic atmosphere. La Fanu paints a picteresque vista of the Styrian setting of our story. Thick european forests, gothic castles with moats, abandoned villages and ruined estates, hot teen lesbian vampires...this book is fucking HORNY! I was suprised by how steamy some of the scenes between Laura and Carmilla can get. It was also quite spooky at times. The descriptions of how the vampirism in this story works is kinda unusal compared to our more modern and established streotypes. It reminded me more of a ghost story. The mental image of watching from the bed as a blood soaked Carmilla floats out of a room while locked doors open and close before her is a pretty horrific scene to imagine. The ending to this story is pretty hardcore, gorey &amp; magical. When you think about killing vampires you think maybe a stake through the heart or sunlight. &gt;!Not corpses floating in tombs filled with blood, getting staked, beheaded, burned and the ashes spread on a river.!&lt; Brutal. But for all it's merits, I found it also had some flaws. Some elements of the story remained unexplained and that makes it a bit unsatisfying. Although you can brush them off as vampire magic but getting details would have been more fulfiling. 7/10.\n\n Moving on...\n\n**SECONDLY**: I read The Vampyre: A Tale by John Polidori. This is the oldest book on my list and some might consider it the basis of what vampire stories are built on. It was drafted in that fateful night in Geneeva, alongside Frankenstein in the presence of some of the greats of the romantic era. It was aight. The prose felt a bit too...verbose and difficult at times. Especially compared to Frankenstein it's contemporary which flowed by smoothly. And yet, it also felt very fast and poorly paced. I barely had any time to reflect on some events. It was a short story and did good for what it was set to do, but I still felt it could have used a few more pages. I give it this though &gt;!I was not expecting Ruthven to triumph so fucking hard at the end. Aubery died, his lineage destroyed. The vampyre lived to kill another day. You don't often read about evil struting out victories.!&lt; I loved the depiction of Lord Ruthven the Vampyre. A creature that exists solely to spread misery and misfortune as much as he possibly could. Something that would go out of it's way to defile beauty and virtue. And I loved how his influence worked more like a haunting on Aubrey, slowly driving him mad. And he's utterly supernatural, evil, and beyond defeat.\nIf I have to be honest though, my favourite parts of this book were the excerpts of letters regarding Lord Byron at the begining and the end of the book, especially the one about his residence in Greece. What a beautiful picture it described. Lord Byron was a fascinating character. I wrote down the poems of his that were mentioned in this book for later study. That is Childe Harold's pilgrimage &amp; Giaour. Over all, I give the Vampyre 6.5/10.\n\n\nAnd lastly...\n\n**THIRD**: I'm reading Dracula. Now, it's unfair to compare this to the other two books since it's more than 200 pages longer than them and a proper novel, and also more recent compared to the other two, but I can already tell this is going to be a way better experience. I love how much time Stoker spends describing the natives and the rustic scenary and culture of eastern europe as we approach the castle. The abridged version I read doesn't compare to this in regards to establishing ambience and slowly getting introduced to the setting of the story. The text is smooth and easy to follow yet posh and eloquent. I love how oafish and dorky John Harker the paprika man seems to be and I love how seductive and meek Dracula starts off. I'm really eager to get to the meat of the story where the Brides are tormenting John and Dracula sets sails on the ship. And who can forget Carfax Abbey.\n\n\n**TLDR**: Vampires have been horny fiction for hundereds of years. Lord Byron was a fucking chad. We all could use more paprika in our food. R.I.P. Ianthe.",

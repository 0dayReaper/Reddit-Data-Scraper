During their discussion, I noticed that Jim used phrases like \"many people,\" \"most beautiful,\" and \"tremendous\"  etc.    \nThese particular word choices reminded me of a certain politician. I'm curious, do you think there might be a connection or influence between our former president and the character Jim Taggart in Atlas Shrugged?",

It's a shitty worldview to hold other people to.  \n\nBasically, it works if you're trying to be a corporate executive where key values revolve around concepts like \"productivity,\" \"efficiency,\" \"profit\" etc, but it kind of falls apart when applied to human relationships.\n\nI'm very glad that I read the book, and 30 years later I still use things I took from it.  However, it only covers a fairly narrow arc of human experience.  It's like a hammer to keep in your toolbox, which is perfectly appropriate and highly useful for select situations, but you really don't want to use it where a screwdriver or compass is called for.",

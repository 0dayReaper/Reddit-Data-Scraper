I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better for being in Reddit as much as I am, and I think my life may improve if I walk away. \n\nThere are of course a few exceptions, and one of them is where I learn about new books to read. I\u2019m also not on TikTok, and don\u2019t want to be, so \u201cbooktok\u201d isn\u2019t really an option.\n\nSo my question is, what other online communities do you use to be engaged with book culture and finding new books and content?",

I recommend mikes book reviews. He\u2019s a Stephen king, fantasy, horror, sci-fi and lit fan. It depends on your tastes. Good reads, is a good recommendation, however IMO I think it used to be great but has since changed its target audience after Amazon acquired it.",

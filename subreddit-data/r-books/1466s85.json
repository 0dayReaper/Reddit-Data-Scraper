Is there even one person out there who thinks \"Gee, I'm so glad I learned that the real killer was Larry all along! Now I can't wait to read the book!\"\n\nWhy don't editors change this? If you must have spoilers, then move the introduction to the back and call it an \"afterward\". A proper introduction should be short and NEVER give away plot points.\n\nEdit : 72% downvotes...and I thought there would be wide consensus of agreement! A misplaced faith in reason I suppose. Too much groupthink here anyway.",

The former Id agree is disrupted by spoilers but is also a shallow form of reading imo, the latter would to me not seem impaired by knowing the general plot, or even specific plot points, beforehand",

I can still appreciate a book if I know what's going to happen but I usually will enjoy it a little less.\n\nIt also depends a lot on the book. Knowing ahead of time that &gt;!Gatsby dies!&lt; at the end of *The Great Gatsby* wouldn't affect the experience of reading it very much, since the appeal of that book is mostly in Fitzgerald's social commentary, the depth of his characters, and the beauty of his writing. But I do think I'd have been robbed of significant enjoyment if I'd known going into *Rebecca* that &gt;!Maxim killed Rebecca!&lt;. There I think a significant amount of the appeal is in the way that that revelation recontextualizes everything that comes before, and knowing the twist before it's revealed would necessarily make the book less effective.\n\nI don't think you're wrong to feel the way you do but I do think you're in the minority, and \"any piece of media that can be lessened  through spoilers was never good in the first place\" is far from a universal truth.\n\n(I also disagree that \"the author's intentions are largely irrelevant,\" but that's a separate discussion.)",

Readers are bound to craft a unique interpretation based on their unique perspectives. But you can't just ignore an author's intention. \n\nCan you appreciate pacing and presentation while knowing the story beforehand? Sure, but why? Part of the point of reading something (at least for the first time) is to discover the story, to experience it. Part of that experience is the \"novelty\" of discovering the plot--this happens, and then that happens, and then--surprise--that happens. Nothing at all shallow about it. That's how people, including you, have always experienced storytelling. It's very reasonable to begrudge someone who would purposefully disrupt that by giving away spoilers.",

You can know all the twists and turns of Othello without the play's losing a gram of interest for your knowing.\n\nAnd you already know who won the Trojan war.\n\nIf you're setting about reading O. Henry or a thriller, no you don't want spoilers.  But whilst those might be truly entertaining they surely aren't through and through truly good.

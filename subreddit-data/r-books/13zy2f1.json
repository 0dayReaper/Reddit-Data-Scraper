    "postText": "This is a book that gets a ton of hype on Reddit so I decided to check it out. I\u2019ve never read The Martian by I did watch the movie and enjoyed it. \n\nSo PHM definitely has a neat premise (even though fundamentally it\u2019s pretty similar to The Martian) and throughout the book, some of the ideas and concepts explored are definitely pretty interesting. Clearly Andy Weir has done a lot of research.\n\nBut my god\u2026he is a downright atrocious writer from a technical level. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw prose this damn awful in a high-profile bestseller. Maybe in a Dan Brown book? PHM reads like a high-school redditor wrote it, with the terrible prose, juvenile dialogue and cringey attempts at humour. There\u2019s zero character development to speak of, and the protagonist is annoying, unlikable and not the least bit interesting. \n\nThere\u2019s like zero skill and artistry in this book, just a bunch of contrived science problems. Admittedly, some of those are interesting but not enough to overcome the terrible writing.",

Andy Weir had to pretty much rewrite the book for the classroom edition (at least I assume he did, the language in the book isn\u2019t really accepted in most schools).\nBut when you get your book on a schools reading list, you sell a ton of books. So yes, the writing sounds like it was written by a kid, because it was written for kids to read. \nThat being said, most adults these days couldn\u2019t read a real novel even if they tried. So I see how a lot of people like the book. I myself enjoyed it, but can see where you are coming from.",

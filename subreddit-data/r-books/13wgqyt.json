    "postText": "I started with BROM back in high-school, discovering him through his gothic and strange artwork and have been a huge fan ever since. My first book was The Child Thief - a dark retelling of Peter Pan with some Arthurian legends - followed by SlewFoot (a story about a widower Puritan who falls in line with forest spirits), Krampus, (Krampus wages war against Santa Claus in modern times) and finally Old Gods (a murdered man gets wrapped up in a war between mortal spirits and gods).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I love about his books is how he is able to weaver different legends, myths, and religions together so seamlessly. His books follow a central theme of \"Nature/Mysticism vs Man\".Broken down, his books usually follow a human person down on their luck (an abused boy in Child, a failed musician in Krampus, a shunned widower in SlewFoot, and a murdered young man in Old Gods) who are forced to interact with supernatural beings in order to gain power, revenge, or help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur villains are primarily those who want to \"Destroy the old ways\" - from destroying nature and religion to waging war against spirits, deities, and gods. I would like to provide examples of this but I fear it would border the spoiler territory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what I enjoy about Brom's work is how callous he is when it comes to killing off characters - both good and bad. He does not spend paragraphs detailing a dramatic death - as a movie would with slow-mo and a build up. Those killed usually don't get some powerful speech or gasping last breath to share their sorrows...They are just BAM - dead. A few sentences to describe how the person was cut down and that is primarily it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like this because it follows a more realistic approach. It also drills home that no one in the book is safe. You could have this new side-character who feels like they will be the driving force to the story only to have them unceremoniously butchered a few chapters (or even a few pages) later. Swift, brutal, and usually pretty violent. Really puts me on edge as I never know whom I can become attached too as the grisly shadow of death follows everyone including our main character.I highly recommend these books. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want a fun series of books that mix humanity with mysticism; books that are not afraid to be brutal as they are touching, and books that explore various new perspectives of different religions and myths - give BROM a chance!",

He's also responsible for illustrating the cover art for Doom II, and Diablo II, as well as other work for Diablo III, D&amp;D, and various other pieces for tabletop games and comics.  \n\nHis books are as outstanding as his art.",

    "postText": "Considering that English is taught everwhere in the world it would be pretty strange if they didn't meet at least a few locals who can speak at least basic English. But at the same time having everyone they meet speak fluent English would also be kinda weird. Usually most books have the protagonist find a local who is bilingual who acts as an interpreter for them. My country has quite a lot of people who can speak conversational English. Well educated people in most countries can speak at least basic English. But would people speaking broken English be considered offensive? be considered What do you guys think?",

            "comment": "Depends on country, not just for exposure to English but also culture, and history (what position are the characters relative to one another?). The assumption that French people have nothing better to do than speak English with some tourist who can't even be bothered to say 'bonjour' (extremely rude) is *definitely* offensive, the cutesy Parisian fantasy at Anglo convenience is not happening. French culture takes speaking clearly and accent seriously, I've seen people be insecure about pretty good English, just because someone can speak English doesn't mean they're comfortable or want to. These days more will, especially as it's international and especially younger people will, but it shouldn't be taken for granted. There are a lot of those romantic fantasy books with a French setting, but even if they aren't meant to be too serious, they'll definitely have a more authentic flavour with more consideration towards the language, especially with English not being presented as default and an entitlement. Saying bonjour/bonsoir is the absolute minimum.\n\nThe history of Anglo Francophobia also matters here, at the very least. I think it could also matter why and when English is used internationally and not French. If French isn't used in a modern book set in France (etc.) then it's not only the characters but Anglo readers who don't have to engage with it, when they would have even up through the early part of the twentieth century in some cases. I'd suggest the use of translation outside French settings is also considered (for instance The Secret History gives quotations in French).\n\nUnderstanding English, especially written English, is also not entirely the same as speaking (goes for any language). Vocabulary always helps a lot, but pronunciation and listening are skills that also need practice.\n\nI don't think it's autonomatically offensive to have a character use broken English but it should be accurate for a native speaker of their language, they won't all make the same 'mistakes'. It could be taken into consideration the kind of mistakes a native speaker of English will make in that language, too - it shouldn't really be presented as exclusively people in their own country 'struggling with language', as though English is default! The emphasis can be that this person is trying to help and using knowledge the English speaker *does not have the equivalent of*, not that they're somehow lesser for not speaking native English. A native English speaker with more knowledge of their native language might also be better able to follow a speaker of a Romance language speaking non-native English, as they're more aware of rare words and connotations that have fallen out of useage (and yeah, this does mean speakers of Romance languages might get to be better at reading English than a poorly-educated native speaker. They're often enough better educated to start with).",

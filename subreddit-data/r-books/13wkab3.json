Every Wednesday, we'll post a new country or culture for you to recommend literature from, with the caveat that it must have been written by someone from that there (i.e. Shogun by James Clavell is a great book but wouldn't be included in Japanese literature). \n               \nMay 27 - June 3 is [National Reconciliation Week](https://www.reconciliation.org.au/our-work/national-reconciliation-week/) and, to celebrate, we're discussing Indigenous Australian literature!  Please use this thread to discuss your favorite Indigenous Australian literature and authors.\n                \nIf you'd like to read our previous discussions of the literature of the world please visit the [literature of the world](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/literatureof) section of our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/index). \n               \nThank you and enjoy!",

Truly moving.\n\n**Growing Up Aboriginal in Australia** edited/compiled by Anita Heiss. An anthology of stories, some from big names (Tory Burch, Aileen Walsh, Miranda Tapsell) and others from up and coming or unknown authors. It works really well to break down the monolith of Blak in Australia by showcasing the breadth and depth of experiences.",

            "comment": "These two are my favourite books by Indigenous Australian authors\u2026\n\n\n**After Story** by Larissa Behrendt. It is about a young Indigenous lawyer and her middle-aged mother going on a guided tour of literary sites in England. As the influence of authors such as Charles Dickens and Virginia Woolfe are explored, there is a contrast with the oral storytelling heritage of Aboriginal culture. There are some cheeky digs at colonialism, relatable characters, and tasteful handling of trauma.\n\n\n**Too Much Lip** by Melissa Lucashenko. It is about a wild young woman who returns home to hide out, only to get caught up in family drama and protecting a sacred site from developers. The book includes romance and humour, but also tackles some deep themes, such as intergenerational trauma and sexual abuse.\n\n\nAlso I will recommend **Song of the Crocodile** by Nardi Simpson if you like a depressing and tragic story, **Sand Talk** by Tyson Yunkaporta if you like philosophical non-fiction, and **Terra Nullius** by Claire G. Coleman if you like science-fiction.",

I wouldn't call it a great book, but it is a good one and it goes down easy. Highly recommended beach reading if you want something that's smart and emotionally affecting.\n\n*That Deadman Dance* IS a great book about the experience of colonialism through the eyes of the colonized. It's a little bit more difficult of a read but it's fantastically well written.",

I have *The Yield* waiting in my current line up of \"to read\" but swallow the air is her autobiography if I'm remembering correctly. It was one of the prescribed texts in my HSC year, and I am so glad it was, I highly doubt I'd have ever found it otherwise.",

He has discovered redemption, identity, purpose, endurance in suffering, truth amongst the lies, loss and rebirth. Through his highs and lows, he has always come back to plant his feet on a higher hope and to face his challenges head-on with faith, determination, and a streak of humour.",

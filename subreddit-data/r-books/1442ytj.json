    "postText": "The book is about a crack in the sea floor opening after a series of earthquakes, through which radioactive radiation seeps out, nobody knows the cause, maybe just weird volcanic activity or maybe there was a nuclear submarine that sank there in the past or the spot was used to get rid off nuclear waste secretly? So scientists decide to send someone back in time to the 20th century to figure out what happened, to ensure the nuclear catastrophy can be prevented, but the connection fails and the scientist gets stuck in the past.\n\nI've recently received a copy of this book as a gift for my birthday and have only read the first 1/2 or so of this small book but can already absolutely recommend it. I dont think it was ever translated into english though, but if you're able to read german, it's both exciting AND hilarious. The cover design of the first edition I got is wonderful, it's red and purple and there's a UFO? So we'll see where the story goes...\n\nCommunist german science fiction has to be my new favourite genre to explore throughout the next few months. \n\nHas anyone else read it? What did you think?",

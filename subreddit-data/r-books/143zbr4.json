    "postText": "I went into this book completely blind. I knew that the topic of depression and feeling outcast would come up, but was woefully unprepared for the book. \n\nI spent the entire book hoping that Yozo would get the help he needed, find someone to talk too, and feel human and full. It was gut punch after gut punch. The final blow was the morphine addiction at the end. By that point I knew he wouldn\u2019t get better. \n\nAs someone who has dealt with depression and feeling out of the loop with people, almost every line broke my heart. I don\u2019t think I will be able to talk about the book in any kind of detail or read it again without sobbing through it. And I finished it in February. It\u2019s an amazing book that puts a lot of feelings into the right words, but is absolutely heartbreaking.",

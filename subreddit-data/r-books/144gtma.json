Have you ever read a book where the story opens your eyes to the fact sometimes our problems are really not as earth shattering as they seem to us? This isn't to discount how stressful or life changing our individual internal or external battles are. However, was there ever a book that after reading it just made you go, \"yeah, my life isn't that bad afterall\"?\n\nI'm currently reading \"Man's Search for Meaning\" by Viktor Frankl, and while I'm currently in a place in life where I hate my job, and am feeling pretty unhappy with where I am in life, I can just get a new job and turn my situation around. Reading this book, makes me take a step back and really puts things into perspective about how hard life can really get for some who don't have a choice to change the situation they're in.",

Only when I came to Western Europe some 20 years later, it turned out that I was perfectly healthy and all the \"treatment\" and restrictions alltogether had been unnecessary. I pretty fell into a hole at the time, feeling sorry for myself and not being able to make up for the lost time.

            "comment": "Their are a couple of books who really put things in perspective for me. Girl at war by Sarah Novic, she came from mariupol by Natasha Wodin and the hare with barnstone eyes by Edmund de Waal. These are al stories about people who have had their family history intertwined with war and all it's horrors. Whenever i read these books, i feel so lucky and blessed that i never had to endure war or be near one. Girl at war is fictional but is heavily inspired on real life events from Novic parents and Grand parents. She came from mariupol and the hare with barnstone eyes are biographical/ archival stories about the familie  lineages of Wodin and de Waal.",

    "postText": "Man it was a journey, it was a completely different style of writing than I'm used to. Miss a paragraph and you probably missed a new high king of noldor. I felt that this was a book made for re-reads.\n\nAlso one thing I noticed was it wasn't that difficult, sure I had to look up family trees every 2 pages but it really wasn't that difficult.\n\nThe  names are very confusing, so many fin's.\nAnd the I think the description of events was a bit too little. I expected a bit more for war of wrath, morgoth's duel and many others but there's an entire chapter for geography\n\nAlso a few things - \n\n1) Huan is probably one of the few good characters\n2 )Sauron losing as a werewolf and turning into a vampire to escape was funny \n3 ) feanor is an asshole\n4 ) thingol is an asshole and a hypocrite\n5 ) beren and luthien was an amazing story\n6 ) throndor is a MVP\n\nAlso I have a few doubts, where does feanor ask for galadriel's hair, where are maiar of each valar mentioned. Is it the unfinished tales ?\n\nI've already forgotten a few things tbh but overall an awesome read.",

            "comment": "I thought Faenor asking Galadriel for her hair was in the Silmarillion, if it isn't then it's either in Unfinished Tales or the History of Middle Earth. However note that History of Middle Earth makes the Silmarillion look like The Hobbit. \n\nThe details of the Maiar and their relationship with the Valar would also likely be somewhere in HOME. \n\nPersonally I think my favorite part is either Fingolfin vs Morgoth, or Finrod's rap battle with Sauron. \n\nTo me the book reads very much like a fictional history book, but a very well written one, especially with how it jumps between very large scale and very small scale stories. And yeah the only hard thing about it is the names, other than that it's pretty straightforward",

Of course Tolkien always placed a high priority on \"worldbuilding\" stuff such as language and geography, but I think he intended to flesh out the stories a lot better. (I'm told there are also a bunch of inconsistencies, though I can't recall any specific examples.)",

Only part that really made sense lol \nOkay, I DID like how the BBEG was the discordent note in the song of Time and how everything is a perfect song except for this one dude who refused to literally play along.

There's a lot of positives in the stuff after season 5 is well, I think the bigger issue is that the main Ark of the first 5 seasons is completed it and so they just kind of Vamp their way through.\n\nIt works though. There's a reason the show is still going. It may not have been as good as it was in the first 5 Seasons but it wasn't garbage by any stretch.",

The creator and the destroyer. The creator can only create, and for a very long time all that there was in all of existence was the pure, raw material and energy that they created. The god of destruction can only destroy, and they shattered the pure light of creation into colors and the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum, they gathered up the raw matter the creator had made so that there was more of it in some places than in others and set it ablaze to make the stars. They tore through the fabric of the universe to open a path for magic to flow from the positive energy plane to the negative energy plane, which would later allow for arcane magic and the existence of souls (which are basically just a type of self-sustaining spell).\n\nBasically, it's a whole universe built as a relief carving, designed by the god of destruction and defined by the parts he chose not to carve away from the undefined and undifferentiated ball of stuff that the creator made. Defying the will of that creator wouldn't be too difficult, because they barely have a will of their own (a trait shared by a not insignificant proportion of mythological \"creator\" gods, who tend to be less humanish than their descendants). Defying the destroyer god would be more difficult, but it's still possible because they're limited by their inability to ever truly create, and they can't destroy forever because they don't control the size of the block that they carve away from.\n\nIt would still be a high level epic quest to fight either of them, but D&amp;D characters have gotten that powerful before. All you really need is a good way to make it impossible to die, and then also a good way to come back once you inevitably die anyway.",

Faith channels that quintessence back, but there are limitations and His power has become indirect, vested in a holy Empire sort of deal.\n\ni realize this sounds like a lot, but the game's been going on for 2 years now so it's just sorta in the background for me.

But it had been mostly forgotten by the time Dan Brown became popular.  I think the lawsuit was just a couple of the authors trying (with some success) to get back in the limelight, taking advantage of the fact that a popular author was bringing that mythos into the mainstream. The lawsuit (and media coverage around it) did in fact boost sales of their book, though I don't know if it was enough to cover their legal fees. ",

The laws of physics and reality as we know it aren't the way the universe actually works; we just think they are because all of human history lies within this abnormal pocket. At some point, however, we will pass out of this pocket of reality and the normal laws of reality will reassert themselves. The problem is that the laws of reality are fundamentally incompatible with the way our minds work. At extreme levels, [it's like running COBOL programming through a C++ compiler.](http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/8399/roleplaying-games/thought-of-the-day-on-the-insanity-of-the-mythos) At lesser levels, it's like running code through a buggy emulator.\n\nThe Necronomicon of the Mad Arab Abdul Al-Hazred offers the reader a glimpse into the universe as it is actually supposed to work. You can probably skim through its pages and be fine, but any detailed reading would be like copying sectors of your brain from a Windows PC to a Mac. Those sections of your brain will stop working; or, worse, they'll start working in ways inimical to human consciousness.\n\nThe translations lessen this effect, but contain numerous dangers of their own in the magical rites and rituals they contain.",

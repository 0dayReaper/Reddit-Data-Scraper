Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in!",

    "postText": "I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share! \n\nGrowing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them. \n\nI don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page. \n\nI think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying. \n\nBut a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book. \n\nNow I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around. \n\nEdit: everyone\u2019s complaining about my one-paragraph-mobile-formatting-brick so I fixed it, hope that helps",

Same thing happened to me - I was always known as the guy with his head in a book but, apart from rare vacation reading, I didn\u2019t read a book for about three years after smartphones took over.  I kept getting hooked on stupid apps and free games.\n\nI finally got angry with myself, deleted the various apps and games from my phone, and show-horned reading back into my life.\n\nI started keeping a reading diary too, and I find that helps - I try to outdo the precious months\u2019 reading and cram an extra book in.  \n\nI find my attention span and vocabulary have both improved and I actually feel less braindead.",

I had more difficulty in understanding people and figuring things out, partly as I had trouble focussing.  Browsing shit on your phone or playing a mindless game is quite a passive activity and I believe your brain goes into a \u201cpowersave\u201d mode.\n\nAn hour or two with a book seems like a more active interaction between eyes and brain, and I feel sharper when engaging with others.  Not sure why, but that\u2019s just what I noticed.\n\nI have a very busy life so it\u2019s difficult to find time for reading.  I have to consciously show-horn my reading in.  I start by carrying a book *everywhere*.  That way if a train is cancelled, the bus is stuck in traffic or the dentist is running late, I always have my book with me.  It\u2019s amazing when you look up from reading on the bus and see every single other person sitting slack-jawed, bathed in the blue light of their smartphones.\n\nI read every lunch break at work.  Only about 20-30 minutes per day, but this is the main daily opportunity for me to read.  I also try reading in the evening but there\u2019s often too many distractions.  \n\nMy favourite time to read used to be in bed before sleep, but I can\u2019t do that at the moment as I\u2019m too tired from work - I also smoke weed regularly, so by bedtime my brain can\u2019t follow a complicated plot (or even a long sentence) without getting confused!\n\nWhen I tried to get into reading again, I picked up some of my favourite old books I\u2019d read before but not for years.  I also looked up which books had won the Pulitzer and Man Booker prizes for fiction and bought them second hand, as I figured they would at least be well written.",

I had Internet access but it wasn't enjoyable to watch anything on my tiny phone and nothing satisfied me for more than a few minutes. So I pulled out a paperback book I had brought with me and started reading. I read well into the night, and it calmed me down (I was feeling stressed about several things at the time). I think about that experience a lot.\n\n2) It's hard for me now that the weather is getting colder, but during the spring and summer I love to sit outside. For some reason I don't enjoy watching videos or playing with my phone when I'm outside, so I'd bring my kindle outside with me and read for hours. That really tapped me back into reading again. With the weather being colder, I'm trying to make a space in my home that's comfortable and where I can read. I reserve that space just for reading. I'll put on some instrumental music in the background and curl up with a book.",

Concentrate on your breathing, and notice that your brain should quieten and your heartbeat should slow.\n\nNow pick up a book and start reading. Ideally, pick a book by a great writer so each sentence is perfectly constructed.

Eventually I stopped going to the library at all. \n\nI told myself books just weren't as good as they used to be.\n\nThen one day, I just got fed up scrolling through the internet (including reddit) looking for that interesting new tidbit that I would soon forget anyway, and picked up an old book from the early 50s that had been passed down from my parents, and read it through in one sitting. I've since read another 10 or 15 more from the same collection. \n\nI now purposefully set aside a time each day for offline reading of real paper books. \n\nI hope this lasts....",

Up to about 20 year olds its stable and then there is a downward trend.\nAlso to give my personal experience with reading: i love reading but have trouble finding something i like and when i get a book i dont like it often makes me drop reading entirely for months. Added to that, books are simply expensive and libraries are starting to disappear everywhere. I simply couldnt afford to read as much as i would want as i burn through a good book within days and i cant drop 100\u20ac+ on books",

I've read two books in the last 18 months (and scarcely for the last 3-5 years) and it actually makes me sad in a way that I can feel in my solar plexus. The way I've lost that knack for reading, that thrill of turning pages... I've read books in the past that literally had my pulse hammering as I read (not the sexy kind, haha), and a few books where the twist has made me feel reality-sick.\n\nSo for now... I've deleted Facebook and am keeping other social media minimal (Reddit may be my downfall...) and am solely using tracking sites as \"social media\" - Goodreads, Last.fm, Letterboxd and Grouvee. \n\nI have a ten hour flight on Saturday and I'm loading my Kindle with some books that sound interesting, perhaps a re-read in there may help. \n\nIf anyone's got any tips on picking up reading again...

My reading habit issue was a little different -- I was reading so much for work (books, articles, papers) and with my kids that I had little desire to read books for my own pleasure, and the habit atrophied -- but I think the same solution might work.\n\nI have 20m on my calendar in the morning to read for pleasure, and 45m in the evening before bed. No phone or computer or other distraction during that time, just coffee/herbal tea and curled up with a book. I recently added a monthly \"book day\": a Sunday a month where my kids and I spend the whole day reading, with breaks for eating and running around as needed, and a family board game at the end.\n\nBut the key to all of this is that those \"reading appointments\" are just as important as any other personal appointment I make, and I keep them the overwhelming majority of the time.",

                    "comment": "Maybe r/books is not the right place for this discussion, but I haven\u2019t related to this since I got out of my depression. I have no clue how much time I spent on my phone when I was depressed, but back then it was constantly paired with feelings of guilt and shame; phone usage was a tool of procrastination. Now, I\u2019m mentally healthy after years of therapy, but I still spend relatively much time on my phone. But I can\u2019t pair those negative feelings to that anymore!\n\nSee, I don\u2019t feel my phone free time would be put to better use. I\u2019d obviously like to read more (or I wouldn\u2019t have clicked this thread!) but I\u2019m not sure reading is objectively better than using Reddit. Or reading a published paperback is inherently better than a 100k words fanfiction with its own worldbuilding and unique plots - which I\u2019d read on my phone. Most of the non-reading and non-phone activities I do are quite useless as well: Netflix, video games, IRL games, puzzles. Last night I did Lego with my SO and it was fun, but again, quite useless.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s only one way to not feel useless doing a hobby to me: it has to be creative. And that\u2019s its own can of worms, isn\u2019t it? At least it is for me. \n\nSo I learned how to stop feeling guilty about leisure activities, and that includes phone and social media time. It started with learning how to stop using this as a procrastination tool, and I suppose that also meant spending less time on my phone. \n\nIn the end, I don\u2019t disagree with you. And anybody who got out of their phone addiction I applaud. But if anyone reading this is like old me and can\u2019t figure out *how* to stop, you first need to figure out *why* you do it. Treating the cause is much more complex than the symptoms, sadly. But the phone itself just may not be the issue.",

E.g. when i had reddit on my home screen i would unlock my phone and be on reddit before I could even think. Moving it helped that\n\n\u2022 replace apps you deem to not have any real benefit from your phone and get some better ones. Since i've added libby / kindle, audible etc. I read *a lot* more often. \n\n\u2022 i have, for the most part, stopped surfing curated sites that use algorithms to recommend me certain things. I barely touch instagram's feed anymore, I usually don't browse reddit's front page (i just favourite all the subs i like and then usually check them out every so often and sort by top of the week to get all the good stuff) \n\nI'm sure there is plenty other good advice out there, but I found these work really well for me. You can pick and choose some and try them out if you want. I recommended these to someone else on this sub and recieved good feedback so I thought i'd share. They really have helped my mental health and removed a lot of the negative aspects of my phone and I have definitely been reading a lot more books since",

It\u2019s great to start the new year off with optimism and set a lofty goal that you tell yourself you\u2019re ~definitely gonna reach this year~ but in my experience it hurt me a lot more than it helped me. Because eventually that new year optimism wears off and you\u2019re right back into your normal day to day life and having that big goal that you haven\u2019t come close to reaching looming over you makes reading feel more like a chore than anything else. Then the end of the year comes and goes and you\u2019ve not even hit half of your goal, it\u2019s hard not to feel a bit of failure. I\u2019ve learned that setting tiny, realistically attainable goals (even if you do multiple) helps a lot! Last year I set a goal of 12 and barely read one or something, and it felt awful and made me that much more anxious about reading. This year I set a goal of one - now I\u2019m about to be at 3. I celebrated when I hit my goal of one, and now I get to celebrate every book after! It doesn\u2019t feel like a chore this way, it feels fun and rewarding.",

Read anytime I had a spare minute.\n\nSomewhere along the way other hobbies took over and I hit a massive reading slump. Unfortunately I\u2019m still in the slump, haven\u2019t read anything in 6+ months. Takes me way longer to read than before, couldn\u2019t concentrate, had to reread pages because I missed the information on it. At some point I just stopped. I figured it was just a consequence of getting older and having less free time. But I desperately want to be able to read like that again.\n\nI\u2019m slowly getting there, I\u2019ve been listening to an audiobook tiny bit by tiny bit so I\u2019m hoping that jolts me back into it. I\u2019ve got so many books that I want to read, so I\u2019m hoping I can I\u2019m just trying to not force it because I know that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nI\u2019m loving audiobooks though so I might keep on listening for a bit instead of reading",

It\u2019s possible that I also read \u201cA Walk Across America\u201d by Peter Jenkins more than once, as it was my favourite for a long time and I remember doing a project on it in 7th grade or something. It\u2019s pretty sad now that I think about it, but rest assured that old frame of mind is definitely gone.

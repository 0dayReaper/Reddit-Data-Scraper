    "postText": "I read the ocean at the end of the lane by Neil Gaiman a few days ago and then took mushrooms the next day. \n\nThe feeling of taking things as they come and accepting things even if you don\u2019t understand them, which he did because he was a child, but on a trip you have to do because you have no other choice.\n\nThe feeling of content euphoria and a quick creepy experience reminded me of this book. In a trip I will be feeling great and in a split second things will turn creepy, but the euphoria is back in no time.\n\nAnyone else feel like a book feels like a psychedelic experience?",

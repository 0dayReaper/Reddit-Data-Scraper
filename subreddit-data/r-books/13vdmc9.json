    "postText": "In Eye of the World, the Wheel of Time series, at the end after Rand chops the cord of Ba'alzamon off and runs back to Moraine and Egwene, it appears they already know he channeled the power, as Egwene says she doesn't care about him being a channeler, before he even tells them about what happened with Aginor. They also say Moraine told Lan, Nynaeve, and Egwene, but told them what? That he was a channeler? How would she know that? She literally asks him to tell her everything that happened about the cords and with Aginor on the hill ,so she doesn't know about what happened and couldn't know he is a channeler, but she somehow still does.",

Shortly after the party leaves the Two Rivers, do you remember a scene where Moiraine tells Egwene about what it's like to start to channel? The mental and medical side effects? All that stuff happens to Rand. That's not even getting into things that fet revealed later. Moiraine came to the Two Rivers for a reason. \n\nAlso, /r/wot.",

            "comment": "He basically tells them himself.  The text says,\n\n&gt;\"It doesn't matter,\" Rand said.  \"Aginor and Balthamel are dead, and so is Shai'-\"\n\n&gt;\"The Dark One\", the Aes Sedai cut him off.  Ill or not, her voice was firm, and her dark eyes commanding.  \"Best we still call him the Dark One.  Or Ba'alzamon, at least.\"\n\n&gt;He shrugged.  \"As you wish.  But he's dead.  The Dark One's dead.  I killed him.  I burned him with...\" The rest of memory flooded back then, leaving his mouth hanging open.  *The One Power.  I wielded the One Power.  No man can...* He licked lips that were suddenly dry.  A gust of wind swirled fallen and falling leaves around them, but it was no colder than his heart.  They were looking at him, the three of them.  Watching.  Not even blinking.  He reached out to Egwene, and there was no imagination in her drawing back this time.  \"Egwene?\"  She turned her face away, and he let his hand drop.\n\nEgwene and Nynaeve both figure out instantly, in the same moment he does, who and what he is - a male channeler, at the very least.  They don't make the leap to the conclusion Moiraine knew all along, though.  Egwene comes right back and hugs him; Nynaeve says that he's still Rand al'Thor of Emond's Field, but he is too dangerous.  It's at that point he comes out and tells them the whole story of what really happened between him and Ba'alzamon.\n\nYou'll find out more about Moiraine's background early in the next book; it's fair to say she didn't come to Emond's Field randomly, and Lan knew the mission she was on.  She may not have known on Winternight which of the boys was the Dragon Reborn, but by the time they got to Watch Hill, she could be nearly certain.",

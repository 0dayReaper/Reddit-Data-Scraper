    "postText": "For me personally, I see a lot of parallels with Brave New World and our world today. With people living far away from the issues and management of the real world through new technologies imposed by higher ups. The characters, Bernard and John are people who look at society with a \u201ccritical len\u201d and logical view but are seen crazy. Arguably BNW isn\u2019t the worst dystopian world to live but it is definitely very uncanny and concerning. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen a lot of places follow in the footsteps of the novel 1984. The changing of history to fit your own political needs and constant surveillance. The character Winston is a man who just wants to know the truth but is put down.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

In particular, the scene in the beginning where the women suddenly lose their ability to pay for things becuase the payments are done electronically and the government cut off access to their accounts. We've seen this tactic used quite recently to combat dissent...in the book's supposed safe haven, Canada.",

What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. \n\nOrwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. \n\nOrwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. \n\nAs Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny \"failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.\"",

The original book might be really good but things like audio quality or a narrator's voice, either their normal voice or a goofy voice for a character, can take me out of the story for a moment. I'll still find myself getting distracted and not really listening just like when you're reading but not really understanding any of the words on the page. One thing with audiobooks is that when there are a lot of characters with similar sounding foreign names, I'll get confused as to who is who because seeing the name is easier to remember than just hearing it although a good narrator will differentiate their voice to help hint at who is talking. Some audiobooks will have a cast of narrators doing the characters. Some narrators are very bad at doing the voice for the opposite gender, it sounds very off putting while others will just enough subtle pitch or tone to show who it is without sounding ridiculous. I've listened to a bunch of books narrated by Lou Diamond Phillips and he does a good job but there's one character that sounds like a man impersonating Katharine Hepburn.",

    "postText": "Another beautiful story set during the second World War. \n\nThe characters are portrayed and developed superbly. Doerr expertly narrates and develops both main characters: a blind Parisian girl, and a curious and enterprising German boy. Both possess the purity of childhood, which is then attacked by their circumstances. \n\nThe storytelling is beautiful. I enjoyed the short chapters which capture alternating POVs. Doerr masterfully switches between time periods further enriching the reading experience. The writing is crisp but not terse. \n\nI found myself re-reading and mulling over several bits. I especially loved how poetic the last sentence of each chapter is. \n\nVery nice read. Recommend.",

I struggled through, hoping for something interesting to happen.  I felt the same about another r/books favorite, The Nightingale. I suspect I am just cynical and jaded, but rather give me characters who are conflicted, who make dubious choices, who feel real and flawed, like the people I know.",

Searched the sub instead of starting a new thread so\u2026 yeah It didn\u2019t hit the way I thought it would based on the widespread praise\u2026 just another sentimental WWII story with a couple less common elements. Unpopular opinion but that\u2019s me.",

I said to myself: ugh, another story from Nazi germany that will get me emo, make me sad, and give me hope. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. \n\nEr, maybe I\u2019m a little jaded as well, but it was still nice to feel that way, if only through a book. \n\nWhile Marie-Laure is indeed a 1D character, she is a green eyed kid, and her character grows. Like that sequence where von Rumpel accosts her outside the grotto and her puerile frustration about her father \u2018abandoning\u2019 her (while he\u2019s actually in a camp) erupts to the fore.",

The storyline involving the generational ship didn\u2019t really seem compelling enough to stand on its own and I had hard time relating to the girl who spent most of her time in VR world.",

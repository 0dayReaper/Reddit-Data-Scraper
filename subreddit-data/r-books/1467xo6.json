    "postText": "Cozies are my guilty pleasure. Some of them are borderline well-written (compared to the quality of the genre), and I usually end up learning something about the small business of the lead character. I also love reading about tea, baking and libraries so I have a soft spot for those cozies.\n\nI recently listened to a galley on audio, and loved it. Objectively, it was not very good, but the atmosphere was fun and the racy pace leant itself really well to the narration.\n\nSo I picked up another audio galley and I think I am hooked. \n\nDo you guys like cozy mysteries?",

I can zip through them, not have to totally concentrate on them, and I like the simplicity of \"small town life\" that is usually inherent in them, but with a little spice, lol.\n\nI particularly like the ones with recipes :) I've made many from Joanne Fluke, and several from Dianne Mott Davidson. \n\nI can't listen to audiobooks in general-my mind completely wanders and I have no idea what's going on! I wonder if a cozy would be different in audio though-maybe I'll try it!",

I chuckled throughout and the mystery is very good, I really enjoyed it. I listened to the audiobook and they have a great narrator, Jim Fragione. Also, David Rosenfelt\u2019s Andy Carpenter series (narrated by Grover Gardner), the first book is Open and Shut and Eileen Brady\u2019s Kate Turner, DVM series, the first book is Muzzled, narrated by Caroline Shaffer both are on the light side and have a humorous tone and are really very good.",

And also murder. \ud83d\ude09\n\nI've just finished the The Finders by Jeffery B Burton. Dog trainer has a team of cadaver dogs. One of them has a very special talent for finding murderers.  Again, a guy who really loves his dogs and dogs that love him. There are three in the series so far.",

It's so helpful to just get caught up in a silly, cheesy, but genuinely fun story when my brain insists that I should do literally anything but the task at hand. It just makes it more palatable!\n\nI used to listen to romances for the same bubble gum kind of experience, but I found the explicit scenes were sometimes too jarring while I was just trying to zone out. Cozies hit that spot.",

    "postText": "Was having a discussion about the book with my wife. She casually mentioned that the narrator is homosexual and that\u2019s the whole subtext of the book. I had absolutely no idea and did not even pick up on anything. Is that a thing or is she making this up?\n\nMy take was that the narrator is hopelessly in love with Holly too. The nature of his unrequited love, though melancholic in his mind, is always overshadowed  by his constant, near obsessive, curiosity about the mechanics of Holly's exciting and wild world. This drives him to be cold and analytical but never unwavering of his awe towards Holly. \nDid I miss something entirely?",

In general however, gay men react positively to shows of women defying societal norms and getting away with it. The whole diva and gay icon idea being the most performative of this.\n\nWomen acting out of societal norms and getting away with it after all shows that gay men can as well. \nThe causes of gay rights and the emancipation of women are as such closely linked, because both require a reevaluation of things deemed feminine.\n\nSo from that perspective, he may indeed be very invested in her life and actions in a nonromantic/nonsexual way. In the same way that gay men can be very invested in the life of female celebrities who beat cultural odds and society\u2019s norms and expectations.",

There is of course Satine in Moulin Rouge! where harold is the gay male friend. In general writers (and audiences) seem to be obsessed with flighty, hot, sex workers and their gay male bff (or at least make bff who is the only man who doesn\u2019t want to have sex with her). If you view marrying tom buchannon for money prostitution daisy buchannon fits into this mold with nick. Anyway this is a long winded explanation of a trope that i find super annoying and diminutive toward women and i wish we would stop holding it up as the epitome of literature it\u2019s not it\u2019s a trope.",

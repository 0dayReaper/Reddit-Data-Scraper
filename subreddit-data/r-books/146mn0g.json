You open up your AI Writer app and type in: \"Gory horror novel written in the blended styles of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle / Clive Barker. Male and female protagonists, Victorian London setting, body horror, parasites, criminals, prostitutes, slumming nobility. 100,000 words\" or whatever kind of specifications you want.  \n\nA short time later, you have a complete novel tailor made to your input that reads almost exactly as if written by the author of your choice. \n\nYou can do this with art already.  I can ask for a picture of Mickey Mouse masturbating, done in the style of Leonardo da Vinci and get something that is pretty near accurate to what da Vinci would have painted if he lived in the Disney era and had the inclination to waste his time in such a fashion.\n\nI am sure that AI will be able to produce high-quality fiction very soon, if not already.\n\nWhat happens to authors when this is readily available?",

Even with human authors, there really are no original stories left.  Every book and film is a stew of influences by previous works.  People clamber for  more and more of the same  types of stories.  That's why practically every film today is about superheroes.  Why would it be different when AI is doing it?  \n\nNot to mention, people will have the thrill of designing and \"creating\" their own novels without any of the effort required to write a real, human-made novel.\n\nRegarding the quality of AI writing.  Have you compared AI art of about a year ago to what it is capable of today?",

We say it can learn and iterate but it doesn't really, all it does is take a series of inputs, look for commonalities and essentially use that as a filter for it's output. Because of this it can't really generate something with intentional emotional impact. Pretty much anything generated by AI that's actually useful requires significant human filters as well because it doesn't actually understand what it's doing. That's why AI is much more useful for making things like coming up with names or interpreting inputs to find information because it's not good for actually creating information. At the end of the day it's really just mimicking words like a gorilla learning sign language. It doesn't know what it's saying, just that you give it food when it makes certain hand movements.",

            "comment": "This is complicated.\n\nOn the one hand, people saying the quality isn't there are really missing the point. When cell phones started having cameras, camera companies didn't worry because the pictures were such low quality. But it turned out that most people didn't care, if they even noticed. They were happy that it was cheap and convenient even though it was low quality. So in one sense the challenge isn't that AI will start producing quality fiction as that most people already don't care about the quality of what they read and will care even less as people begin to articulate aesthetics particular to or adapted to AI-created stories.\n\nOn the other hand, the economics of AI are not well understood. It costs a lot of money to use a large-language model. Right now we're fooling around with this stuff, but all the companies doing it are losing money it. Like, a lot of money. Because all of the servers and the networking and the energy are not cheap. Then you've got human professionals in affected industries banding together to protect their interests. One of the issues the WGA is striking over right now is whether AI can be credited with writing. \n\nAnd then you have the related issue of data privacy and compensation more generally. LLMs and their visual counterparts are continually being trained on copyrighted material without compensating or getting consent from creators (or, in the case of photos, subjects). There's going to have to be a reckoning, and right now Europe is leading the way on that.\n\nSo at some point, between material costs, industry regulation, and copyrights, it might turn out to be cheaper to have humans do a lot of this stuff. The troubling use-case isn't individuals using AI to disrupt authorship, because a lot of people won't want -- or won't be able -- to pay for it. The real problem is news organizations using it to write stories, and governments using it to astroturf propaganda on social media.\n\nMaybe you're saying \"well, no-click-zone, aren't you contradicting yourself? First you say people won't care about quality as long as it's cheap, and then you're saying AI is prohibitively expensive.\" And yes, that's true, but that's exactly how capitalism works. Companies identify an unregulated space. They move in and externalize as many costs as they can, while internalizing the profits. Eventually the loopholes start to close and regulation catches up. But not completely, because the companies that made a lot of money in the early going now use that money to fight back and keep the loopholes open as much as they can. Eventually a kind of economic equilibrium is reached. Progress slows, prices rise, and you finally start to see whether the whole thing was really a viable industry or whether it was just a bubble.\n\nIn this process, it's those with the least power and resources who are the most deeply impacted. The writers of *Succession* are fine. People who tune into an HBO prestige drama, or read literary fiction are unlikely to be satisfied with anything AI can produce any time soon. But if you're churning out writing for *MILF Manor* or self-publishing 25 vampire romance books a year, you may ultimately be screwed (if your goal was to make a living). \n\nWhether authors as a whole are in trouble remains to be seen. Some people are always going to be willing to pay money for a handcrafted bookshelf rather than buy from Ikea. The \"human touch\" isn't just something that's perceptible in the construction and craftsmanship of the object. It's an external selling point as well. People want to know a human worked on what they, another human, are using, and especially in something as intimate as art, that's likely going to always be the case (though only a lucky few may be able to afford it).",

The moon, obscured by ominous clouds, cast an ethereal glow upon the deserted highway. Fear and curiosity entwined within me, for I knew not the origin nor the destination of this mysterious apparition.\n\nIts headlamp pierced the darkness, like a single burning eye of the infernal beast it resembled. The thunderous growl of its engine reverberated through the desolate air, shaking my very soul. Approaching closer, I beheld the rider\u2014face obscured by a black visor, lending an air of anonymity and foreboding.\n\nThe rider halted, the motorcycle's tires skidding to a screeching halt, sending a shower of sparks into the night. The silence that followed was pregnant with anticipation, as if the spirits of the deceased whispered their secrets upon the wind. I dared not make a sound, nor avert my gaze from this enigmatic figure.\n\nThe rider dismounted, their form erect and purposeful. In a voice, as hollow as a sepulcher, they spoke, \"Long have I roamed these roads, haunted by the specters of my past. But now, I offer you a glimpse into my wretched existence.\"\n\nFrom within their coat, the rider withdrew a tattered journal, its pages yellowed with age. They flipped through the parchment, revealing a litany of names, etched upon its weathered surface like a macabre roll call of the damned.\n\n\"Each name inscribed here belongs to a soul I have encountered on my infernal journey,\" the rider whispered. \"Each soul, doomed to wander eternally upon these spectral highways, their lives forever entwined with the thunderous song of my machine.\"\n\nI shuddered as I realized the magnitude of their revelation. The motorcycle, a vessel of transportation, had become a vessel of damnation, ferrying lost souls through an eternal twilight. The rider extended their skeletal hand, offering me the journal. I recoiled, fear coursing through my veins, for I knew that to touch it would bind me to their cursed existence.\n\nWith a low, melancholic laugh, the rider remounted their infernal machine, a black mist swirling around them. \"Beware, mortal,\" they intoned, their voice carrying on the wind. \"The call of the open road may beckon, but know that the motorcycle you ride may be more than it appears.\"\n\nAnd in a cacophony of roaring engines and eerie laughter, the phantom rider vanished into the night, leaving me trembling in their wake. The journal lay untouched on the cold asphalt, a reminder of the unhallowed secrets it contained.\n\nFrom that day forward, I heeded the warning, my heart pounding with trepidation every time I swung my leg over the saddle of a motorcycle. For the road, once a symbol of freedom and adventure, had now become a gateway to an otherworldly realm, forever haunted by the apparitions of those who had ridden before me.\n\nAnd as I rode into the distance, a single question echoed through my mind\u2014would my name, too, be inscribed upon those haunted pages, forever bound to the eerie fate of the spectral riders who wander the roads of the night?",

People ask,  \"any recommendations for \"summer gal\" fiction similar to these authors, read all these authors, and looking for more suggestions\".  Or \"give me your most uplifting/ inspirational/ lovely novels\nplease\".  \n\nI think AI writing will appeal to novelists, not readers. But writers will have to edit because as I've saw it, there isn't a lot of well written content yet. \n\nPlus, there's copyright. AI isn't going to write a Steven King-like novel. His publishers will sue because they're not going to lose money. Money for publishers, writers, etc., will win over free novels to readers any day.",

Genre stuff, be it romance, westerns, zombie horror etc.  Anything that is mostly crap consumed by an uncritical audience will be the first to be replaced.\n\nAnything with originality, insight or a novel style will still be human origin.  The pool of human authors will shrink, but the quality on average will rise.\n\nTechnology is going to automate a large part of the industry.  It's a constant process, there are not many monks left hand copying and illustrating books, they were supplanted by technology.",

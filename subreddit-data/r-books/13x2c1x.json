    "postText": "**SPOILER WARNING**\n\nAnyone felt that Pullman did not explain fully in his 3rd book? Some of the questions that I still have are the following:\n\n1. what happened to The Authority\n2. why is The Authority so helpless\n3. so who is the new Authority\n4. what happened to the storyline about  Lyra is supposed to be Eve\n5. what happened to the storyline that Malone is supposed to be the tempter\n6. how is this a retelling of Dante's Inferno\n\nthere was so many good reviews about the book and what it was all about and after reading the trilogy, I just felt it was a letdown in the end.\n\nplease tell me why it's a good story and what I may have missed in between the lines.\n\nthank you.",

            "comment": "1. The Authority was old and barely holding together. He died , or rather his particles were reconnected with the universe. \n2. Authority was the first angel, and therefor as old as the universe. He simply outlived his time. \n3.There is no new Authority, as metatron was killed by Melisa and Asriel. They made \"the republic of heavens\"\n4. Lyra was Eve because the tasted \"the forbidden fruit\" of falling in love with Will (there are few sentences cut from the book in american version). Eve wanted to explore feelings and that was the \"original sin\"\n4. Malone was snake/temptress because she spoke about her feelings awakening and her rejection of religion (read the segment with the marzipan). In this analogy, the marzipan is the forbidden fruit that represents romantic feelings. \n6. It doesn't relate to Inferno. It has more in common wirh Paradise Lost by Milton.\n\nThe books are alegorical. Daemons represent human soul (interesting connection with Jung's concepts of Anima/Animus), and the Dust represents the human connection with the physical world and all the desiers that come with that.",

It should have been a big deal in Lyra's world but there was a reference near the ending that the church was getting stronger.!&lt;",

In Will's and Marry's world only two of them know these events, right? \nAnd the Magisterium still holds power, they don't need the Authority to hold onto it",

            "comment": "1. The Authority is found to be frail and incapable. This is, I think, Pullman making a subtle point about how religion appears to be strong and powerful but at its heart is abject weakness. How correct that is, is up to you. Within the story the Authority is simply the first angel, who claimed they created everything else, but this is said to be a lie. They have been usurped by the Metatron.\n2. See point 1. Also, the idea that the Authority will evaporate in a stiff breeze once exposed is Pullman trying to convey that religion evaporates when exposed to reason.\n3. The Metatron was ruling heaven in the Authority's name. Now, whether this was done for political reasons to avoid having them literally warring against actual God, or to make a point about how the second order representatives of religion tend to be the evil ones, even if the ideal they serve is harmless, I don't know.\n4. Lyra is supposed to be a new Eve; the person who first eats from the tree of knowledge. Instead of being cast out by a vengeful God for this knowledge, she's exalted as a truth-seeker. This is also lampshaded by her possession and use of the alethiometer.\n5. Mary is the tempter because she brings Lyra to the point of seeking the knowledge that makes her become Eve. She is a scientist who examines the world rationally, and has personally overcome and rejected religious sentiment.\n6. It's not. It's more like a fusion of Paradise Lost and a retreading of the book of Genesis from an atheist perspective.",

Under this constraint, it functioned like a normal library - the authors get paid when the library acquires a copy. If they have 50 copies of the book and they lend out 50 licenses to read it on a temporary, restricted basis, then everything is normal.\n\nThe Emergency Library is them deciding they will no longer tie the number of licenses to their number of copies. They\u2019re lending out, say, 100 licenses to a book when they only have 50 copies. Contrary to everyone saying otherwise, this is not how libraries work. A real library would have copies for all their licenses, so the authors are getting cheated out of the money they would\u2019ve gotten from the Emergency Library purchasing the right amount.",

There are already cases of the Internet Archive putting up writers of those works for free. Works those writers are actively attempting to sell right now. \n\nThis is not about keeping Shakespeare out of the hands of learning minds. It was never about that. It's about spending a few years of your life trying to write something, make a living at it, and another entity not liking that model and simply copying your work and giving it out for free.\n\nThe agencies and groups that complained do not represent works that are out of copyright. They are rightfully concerned that someone is stealing their products and giving it away.\n\nThis isn't about fat cat publishers and fat cat authors. First of all, those things don't really exist any more. Ask Barnes and Noble. But here is the Author's Guild last comprehensive salary survey of writers they do represent.\n\n&gt; The Authors Guild surveyed its membership and the members of 14 other writers organizations in 2018, receiving detailed responses from 5,067 authors. This included traditionally, hybrid and self-published authors who have commercially published one or more books. When discussing median incomes, the survey looked at both full-time and part-time authors. The respondents reported a median author income of $6,080, continuing a sharp decline over the last decade: $8,000 in 2014 and $10,500 in 2009 (per the Authors Guild\u2019s 2015 Survey), down again from $12,850 in 2007, as reported in a joint Authors Guild/PEN survey.\n\n^ those are the fat cats who are losing out.\n\nhttps://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/authors-guild-survey-shows-drastic-42-percent-decline-in-authors-earnings-in-last-decade/",

They don't show the raw numbers of past surveys, but if you dig around you'll find:\n\n# Surveyed / # Who Consider Themselves Full/Part Time Authors\n\n2018: 5,067 / 3,833\n\n2015: 1,674 / 1,406\n\nNo wonder income decreases when you lower the bar to include more self-published authors and less active writers.\n\nAnd a fifth of those who referred to themselves as full-time authors received $0 in book related income over the year. I've got bad news for them - that's not what full-time means. Even the IRS is going to want you to generate positive income at least once every 3 to 5 years so that it isn't considered a hobby.",

That's the government just chucking some money at you as a matter of public policy, not because of copyright. They could stop doing it tomorrow. Hell they could  pass an 'author tax' that says you need to pay for every copy loaned. \n\nIt's also not the rule in much of the world. It's bascily canada, australia and some parts of western europe that does it. And for much of that it's time limited (5 years in Canada). From the US, you haven't seen a dime other than whatever royalties you'd get from the sale (which is usually less when it's to a library).   \n\nAlso the only reason you'll have earned more on that than royalties is because of how dead tail end sales are these days. The fact you earned out your advance and even see royalties is a small miracle in the first place \n\nBeing frank, almost no authors will see a measurable financial hit from this. Your not making any significant  library royalties over this period, people having the ability to read and ebook now without waiting 3 months won't significantly impact any future checkouts for you in agreate. Unless your one of a lucky handful you were making fuck all in retail sales if the book wasn't new, and if it was just released.....you're just fucked anyways because no one was buying anyways and you're probably never earning out your advance.  Especially if you write series, your back catalogue is often a detriment to future earnings rather than a source of them. \n\nGiven the massive public benefit access to library resources provides, especially in a circumstance like this....scales kinda tilted here.",

The average for a hardcover was somewhere in the 30-50 range last time I looked, paperbacks understandibly less.

We can only hope when they get sued, they will be able to find out exactly how many copies of each book were available nationwide and that their simultaneous lending didnt exceed that. If not, they are at the mercy of the courts and have to hope the public good argument is upheld.\n\nOn the flip side, they will only get sued if a publisher actually thinks the bad PR is worth it and that they have a really good chance of winning. Because if they lose, it opens the door for every public library to move to limitless digital distribution.\n\nMy guess is they will not get sued because their is too much to lose to take the risk.

An author can sue independantly, but they probably won't have the resources and all they would get is their personal damages from the lending of their book. They'd have to be able to build a class action law suit to make it worth a lawyer's time. The whole authors guild would have to be willing to sue (and they won't without the publisher's support). They guild decided to write a PR letter instead. If they were going to sue, they'd have done it instead of a letter. Their lawyers would not want them to make public statements about pending litigation and potential muddy the jury pool and make public arguments that conflct with their legal ones.\n\nThe publishers are really the ones with the resources. They have lawyers, money, and lots of damages - every potential sale if litterally 100x the damages the author suffered. But they also have the most to lose.\n\nThe legal basis is entirely fair use in the context of a short-term national emergency. Internet Archive isn't making any money from this; one factor of fair use is comercial use vs. non-profit education, and as a legal non-profit and a recognized library, they are pretty solid here. The last factor is impact on potential market/value of the product. There is a big impact, but it is hugely mitigated by three facts: 1. the unlimited lending is short-term; 2. the books are over a decade old and generally unavailable in this format at all (there was no perceived value or market by the copyright owner); 3. the books would otherwise have been available for free from the libraries that are closed.\n\nThey even make a pretty good point against a third factor - quantity and quality of the work. While they are giving out the whole work, they do so in pretty poor quality. PDF images and uncorrected computer recognized text. They are purposely making sure that a publisher could easily provide a much better product that most consumers would consider worth spending money on. If you had the choice between a shaky cam bootleg movie for free and an easily accessible blueray copy for a reasonable price, most consumers would chose the blueray. That's why netflix and steam have been so successful.\n\nWhen you add this to the first-sale doctrin, they've got enough of a legal basis to pass a prima facia review and not get tossed in summary judgement. That means a very expensive and drawn out legal battle and the potential to lose and shake the foundation of a very profitable business model.\n\nThe internet archive has been lending digit copies 1 to 1 for a long time and hasn't been sued yet. That means authors and publishers already felt the risk wasn't worth the reward. If they lose that case, they lose the ability to charge public libraries huge licensing fees for ebooks and dictate how retailers sell ebooks. Just imagine if Amazon was able to use its wholesale buying power to purchase hundreds of print copies, digitize one of them, burn the rest, and then sell 1 ebook for every print version they purchased at whatever price they wanted. Then imagine they use their trade-in program to buy back used print books, destroy them, and sell additional digital copies. Instead of throwing away old book and taking them entirely out of circulation, libraries could digitize 1 copy, keep a spreadsheet of how many they had, then throw them all away and keep lending. The market for reprints of classic literature would disappear if every library had hundreds of free digital copies instead of 1. \n\nPublishers don't want anything to do with that kind of risk. Even if they win a case against internet archive for taking the limit off for a few months, they risk the ruling validating the normal business practice of 1 to 1 digital lending.",

I think you bring up some super valid points.\n\nI'm a voracious reader, but also poor, so unless it's an author that I am way into and have been waiting on the next book, I'm buying it used or waiting my turn at the library. In the back of my mind, I've sort of reconciled piracy in digital form in several ways; I could attain it through my library's digital lending program, but I work extremely remote and lending limits hold me back, or the fact that there is no chance that the author would ever have seen direct income from me in the first place. Do you think that undermining the used market in such a manner devalues the initial publication in any manner? I've never really considered it that way.\n\nLuckily, the library systems available to me are robust and I've mostly avoided the moral conflict, but I can't afford, nor will I bring myself to pay hundreds of dollars to a long dead author's estate and publisher for some ones and zeros.",

ReDigi](https://youtu.be/Qz03_yy7d14&amp;t=635s) \n\nThat case has to do with re-sale and first-sale doctrine, but IIRC the crux of the decision is that when I resold a work, I was necessarily making an unauthorized copy of it because for the buyer to receive the work over the internet, it had to be copied from its materiel substrate (i.e. the bits on the magnetic platter of my hard drive) onto another. In that way, I effectively copied the work without the author\u2019s permission. By that logic, the first sale doctrine only protects my right to resale my digital media if I basically sell the buyer the storage device it\u2019s downloaded onto. And I don\u2019t see why this wouldn\u2019t apply to one\u2019s right to loan out digital media the same way you might loan out an actual book.\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of problems with that logic, as it applies to any form whatsoever of the digital consumption of media. Copyright law just isn\u2019t currently compatible with a digital era. But I think that case hasn\u2019t yet been overturned or overruled.",

Spotify is a bit of an outlier because it has nearly everything, and access to the entire database is reasonably affordable. \n\nFor something like old movies though, often the only place to find them legally would be paying something like $15 each on Amazon. That\u2019s a prohibitively high price for getting into old movies and is a barrier for accessibility. \n\nI don\u2019t take you to be saying that the current system doesn\u2019t have barriers to accessibility, but I thought I\u2019d point out that the state of affairs for music these days with spotify is quite different than it is for movies or literature.\n\nedit immediately after posting: $15 is probably too high, but certainly $3/4/5 each - and some higher. Whereas Spotify is a low, fixed, price.",

The person you replied to before me mentioned downloading a book for free and I assumed they meant legally. Apologies. \n\nI have two lines of thought on the matter. \n\n1) theft is wrong - under our current systems it is wrong to offer free copies of someone else\u2019s work without their permission. \n\n2) access to knowledge should be a human right - but that doesn\u2019t mean the creators shouldn\u2019t be compensated in some manner. Ultimately, everything we think is built out of things that already exist and it\u2019s our individual perspective that creates new ideas. New ideas shouldn\u2019t cost people money if they improve our species as a whole. Probably socialist of me but that\u2019s fine.",

The library pays for the book once, the library pays for the book again if they need to replace it.  Author gets paid.\n\nAn ebook sale also results in a royalty, although the royalty structure is not guaranteed to be the same.  The library ebook is artificially limited to ensure that publishers and authors get paid again if the book is popular enough.  That limit is based on the average circulation life of a hard copy book.  The model isn't perfect, but we're still relatively young in the whole ebook lending thing.  \n\nThe good news on the latter is that the more data we get from Overdrive, Hoopla, et al, the better we can make a more equitable lending situations that benefit library budgets, library users, publishers, and authors.  The Internet Archive project effectively distorts the data because we won't see a true measure of demand (because free) and won't get regionalized/localized data surrounding what works and what doesn't.  This *will* result in authors getting compensated less from their work, and that's a big problem.",

            "comment": "I am a public librarian, and here are my two cents:\n\nI 100% support the Internet Archive's goal. The pandemic has severely limited people's ability to obtain low-cost access to books through local libraries. In my library district, all of our physical locations are closed, and will be until at least the beginning of May. All of our physical books (and DVDs, and audio readers, etc.) are not available.\u00a0\n\nThose are all materials paid for by the taxpayers of our service area. They are owned by the library, but more accurately they are owned collectively by the community (public libraries are the most successful and popular socialist program in America!). This virus is, in effect, removing the people's access to their collective property.\n\nWe have kept all of our ebook and online audiobook collections available, and have done what we can to relax restrictions on them. But those collections are NOT owned by us (with a few exceptions). They are owned by commercial vendors, and we license access to them. We have limited power to open them up. Some of the companies are being more generous than normal with access, but they are for-profit companies who balance access and restrictions to maximize their own revenue flow. And in turn, they are usually bound by contractual agreements with publishers limiting what they can do. \n\nNote that all of the restrictions placed on ebooks and audiobooks are fundamentally artificial restrictions, technological additions designed to mimic the inherent physical restrictions that physical books have. Limited available copies, waitlisting, barriers to duplication, limited checkout times -- none of these are natural features of a digital text or audio file. They are all designed to impede the fundamental nature of digital media (which is by its nature infinitely copyable, portable, non-degrading, etc.) in order to preserve the commercial publishing model that was developed for print books.\n\nInternet Archive's Lending Library normally functions exactly the same way that commercial ebook vendors do. They impede copying and sharing, they limit checkout times, and they restrict the number of available copies, using waitlists to manage demand that exceeds the availability restrictions. They don't do this out of commercial interest, but in order to avoid being potentially sued under our current ultra-restrictive copyright laws.\n\nIn most ways, Internet Archive has not changed this at all. The only thing that they have changed is to cease artificially restricting the number of available copies. This is a reasonable and limited response to a sudden, massive increase in user demand.\n\nAny of the commercial ebook vendors could do the exact same thing today, just by flipping a couple of settings in their software. They're probably not going to, though, because doing so would likely violate contracts that they have with publishers. It would also expose the artificiality of their business model in a way that might make people question why those restrictions are considered \"normal.\"\n\nIf you want to understand more, just read the statement linked in the OP. It's a very good explanation of why Internet Archive's action is legal, morally good, and extremely helpful during the present crisis.",

Lots of people (including me) would say that copyright is in need of reform.  I, for instance, think the copyright term should be much shorter than it is.\n* Is this a violation of the current copyright law?  Almost undoubtedly yes.  The Internet Archive says that it adheres to Controlled Digital Lending principles in normal times, and that's arguably legal.  But with this \"emergency library,\" the IA is buying or acquiring one copy of a book, then lending out multiple copies of it simultaneously.  It does not have the legal right to do that.  To justify its action, it says that books that the public *does* own are sitting unavailable in closed libraries.  That's unfortunate, as are other pandemic-related closures, but it doesn't mean that IA suddenly acquires the legal right to treat those locked-down books as its own and lend them out.  It's just not how the law works.\n* Does this ultimately hurt authors?  IA claims most of the books in the emergency library are older and out-of-print editions.  But I found one of my books from 2014 on the list.  It's hard to say whether people who will download these books for free would otherwise have paid for them, but I think if we're looking at general principles, it definitely erodes authors' rights.  Under the law, while my book is under copyright, I have the exclusive right to decide who gets to reproduce my creative works.  I can sell that right (e.g. to a publisher, under mutually agreeable terms) or even waive that right in certain circumstances.  If someone buys or acquires a copy of my book, they get to decide what to do with their single copy.  They can resell it, donate it, or lend it.   They don't get to make unlimited reproductions and freely distribute them, regardless if it would benefit the public to do so.  That's a call I get to make, as the copyright holder.\n\nI think it's possible to hold differing views on these three issues.  For instance, I think it's possible to think that copyright law is in need of reform, while simultaneously acknowledging that what IA is doing is plainly illegal and has the potential to erode author's rights.",

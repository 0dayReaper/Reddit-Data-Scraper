    "postText": "What's the book/scene that's gotten under your skin the most and left you with the heebie-jeebies?\n\nMine is Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer. The scene years later that still comes to mind is when she goes down into \"the tower\" and the walls have writing on it that's alive and the deeper she goes the creepier it gets, until she makes it to the bottom where the light keeper is. That book had so many scenes that weren't jump scary but just got under my skin and creeped me out and took awhile to leave me. I had trouble sleeping after reading each night. Also I was on holiday when I read part of it and in the middle of the night there was an earth quake and I've never felt one before and I straight freaked out because I was already so creeped out from the book and then come out of a full sleep to the world shaking I panicked.\n\nWhat's yours?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for all the great rec's and stories! I really appreciate it. I can't wait to have the time to go through all the comments and upvote and add to my ever growing tbr list.",

The crewpi g unease and dread are intense, and the content it deals with is extreme disturbing, especially in opposition to the initial premise. I really can't say much without potential spoilers, but for an actual skin-crawling but still thoroughly Artsy (?) And emotionally satisfying read I can't recommend it enough.",

I honestly did not know horror books could be that horrible, there are a dozen scenes I can recall very strongly from it, I don't want to spoil it for anyone else reading this but you kind of never get to feel calm. I had to put the book down and ask my partner for a hug every so often. I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone wanting to read horror that will truly get under the skin and stay there.",

Since then, I haven't finished some of his, let's say, later and denser work just because the style and quality changed over the decades as well as my own reading tastes.\n\nThe only reason that I haven't gone back to it is that is was a borrowed copy, either from a family member or the library, and there's just too many good new books to be read and so little time and such a small new book budget when you live somewhere without libraries that have English language books...",

All very possible in novels, but for me, creepiness - that moment when the world's mask *slips* - is best at short-story length.\n\nAdmittedly, I read his stories at a formative age, and the deliberately academic tone may not appeal to everyone (the collection it comes from is called 'Ghost Stories of an Antiquary') but M.R. James' ['Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad'](https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/jamesmr-ohwhistle/jamesmr-ohwhistle-00-h.html) is still the winner for me. There's no gore, since it's a pure ghost story, but the core concept is just so original and creepy that I've linked it on Gutenberg Australia for those who haven't read it. The 1968 BBC TV adaptation starring Michael Hordern is the best, and [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-nJTOIPEfw).\n\nClose runners-up:\n\n* The Yellow Wallpaper - Charlotte Perkins Gilman  \n* The Beckoning Fair One - Oliver Onions  \n* A Recluse - Walter de la Mare  \n('The house was not haunted, it was infested'. De la Mare is a master of creepiness)  \n* Dr. Voke and Mr. Veech - Thomas Ligotti  \n(If you want stories that make you profoundly thankful that magic doesn't actually exist, Ligotti is your man.)",

I had to stop because I was moving across country and it was a library book.\n\nA few tears ago, I picked up a second-hand copy locally and tried again. \n\nUnfortunately, for the last few years, I've been dealing with very bad anhedonia due to the menopause that had reduced my desire to read to almost nothing. I went from reading every single night before sleep, as I had done my entire life since the age of 3 - yes,  I'm hyperlexic - to not reading a single book for nearly a year!\n\nWhile I have started reading again, it was a slow start and it has meant giving many books plenty of second and third (and more, if necessary!) chances. It means recognising that I **have** to match my mood with the book that I am reading.\n\nBut my second attempt at the The Wasp Factory came before I had fully come to understand all of this, so once again it is put back on the shelf, waiting for the right day.\n\nI have also got House of Leaves on that shelf. I bought it a long time ago but at a time when my life was very stressful. I didn't even make it past the first few pages, far enough to be creeped out! I just wasn't in the right headspace to be able to enjoy it. One day though. Maybe not ,while I live in my current house though? It's actually on the edge of a forest in the French countryside, with no neighbours!\n\nOther difficult books from the thousands I've read over the years (my memory is getting a bit fuzzy on details now) that stand out: \n\nThe Sparrow and its sequel by Maria Doria Russell - not so much creepy but grim, still an extremely compelling read though.\n\nThe Hollow Places by T. Kingfisher - in many ways, this is the closest that I've come to feeling 'jump scares' while reading, certainly in recent memory. Not so much gross gore creepy but weird and hauntingly creepy.\n\nTo be honest, some of the creepiest fiction that I've read has been in short stories. And that was the ideal place for it and where it was able to have the most impact. There's only so much creepiness that we can tolerate in one go.\n\nI do find that I have a much, much higher tolerance for horror, gore, and overall creepiness in written form than on screen.\n\nI very rarely read graphic novels, comics or manga so it's hard to say how they affect me in comparison.\n\nI do have total aphantasia which probably helps in that regard.",

Intellectualy, I could see something that was beautiful, like a butterfly, but I couldn't feel and enjoy that beauty.\n\nI lost all interest in my usual hobbies and interests, in my usual TV shows, in reading.\n\nIt was such a stark difference!\n\nThen my period ended after 12 days and it all came back.\n\nThat was in July 2019 and was just a precursor of what was to come.

There aren't too many other novels I found to be scary; even Robert Marasco's *Burnt Offerings* is a distant second. (David Morrell's *The Totem* is a great book, but I would argue that it's truly frightening only at the end.) Lots of short stories really shook me up, though: \"Flies\" (Anthony Vercoe), \"The Lovely House\" (Shirley Jackson), \"Niemandswasser\" (Robert Aickman), \"The Colour Out of Space\" (Lovecraft), \"Sometimes They Come Back\" (King).\n\n***Edit:*** And this one, which I consider the greatest *Twilight Zone* episode that never was: \"The Thirteenth Floor\" by Frank Gruber. https://www.unz.com/print/WeirdTales-1949jan-00034",

Specifically, the parts where the narrator (not the people in the house, but the guy who found the accounts of what happened) starts to realize that he can feel *something* watching him. It definitely didn't help that I chose to read it at night and while alone. I still think about that feeling\u2014knowing that some kind of monster is watching you but not knowing, specifically, what it is or when it might come for you.",

    "postText": "I'm reading a very famous book I won't say the name of, it's about 1,300-1,400 pages (reading on Kindle). I devoured the first third, 80+ pages a day, and then it hit this lull but I wanted to see it through but the lull went on and on and on, Around 60% I felt consumed and defeated, like it felt like a weight on my chest.\n\nEvery time I loaded up my Kindle I felt this urge to keep going and I would read 5, 10, maybe 20 pages and just lose the urge.\n\nI was getting through a book a week, sometimes 5 a month, before starting this journey. It's been almost 7 weeks and I so badly want to just fuckin abandon it at 83%. I know I can push through and finish it this week with some diligence but will I be happy if I do? will I feel more accomplished to take a stand and say no more, book! Fuck you!\n\nWhat's the biggest sunk cost you gave up on?\n\nEDIT: Fine, it's The Stand",

The spelling was atrocious. In spite of the \"modest art collection\" he bragged about in his author bio, he didn't bother with an editor. The plot was contrived. And while I like a good spicy read, it was SUCH a graphic and gratuitous account of a 15 year old kid's sex life. It literally made me nauseous.\n\nI got half-way through and tossed both of them. I couldn't even bother to donate either. I still listen to AFI and had the opportunity of Davey standing literally above me this last winter, but I will NEVER read his fiction again. He's a great lyricist but a trash fiction writer. Never meet your heros, right?\n\nThe positive I took from this was realizing that, as a writer myself (and author hopeful), I am a WAY better story teller than he is.",

I think he published one or two books after I figured i would just read it in one go after he finished.\n\nIt was just too much info and too many characters and not all of it or them even mattered. I just wasn't optimistic that I could remember it all years later when the next book would be published. And I was not planning on rereading.\n\nAt some point I skipped through chapters to the characters and circumstances I found the most interesting. I believe near the end, I was pretty much only reading Tyrion and Cersei chapters.",

The author just drones on and on about the most mundane things. It took me a very long time to read because I dreaded it so much every time I picked it up. It took me months. \n\n\nI think if you're feeling like I was reading Les Miserables, you should drop it before wasting any more time on it. Taking a stand against the bad book (loved how you phrased that BTW) and finding a book that excites you.",

I did like a lot of it, and found some passages quite moving. I was especially impressed with how he described slipping into poverty without a social safety net. He built a lovely word picture of people on a leisure yacht at night, and then a man quietly slips overboard and the people happily carry on with their party, as the ship sails away while he slowly succumbs to the waves. \n\nBut somewhere around the middle I just didn\u2019t pick it up again one day.",

    "postText": "I just finished the Rule of Four, and I\u2019m kind of having trouble with the present day timeline. \n\nThe current order of events, from what I gather is:\n\nTom and Katie start dating right around when he has the epiphany with Paul and they start working together\n\nTom gets more invested as she enters bicker\n\nTom misses her birthday, later visits her at the photo lab and they effectively end things\n\nTom becomes a hermit while he\u2019s working\n\nKatie comes by while his roommates are at the thing, they have their talk, get back together. He decides to stop working on the book, which goes back to the discord with Paul at the beginning when they\u2019re going to the tunnels.\n\nThat\u2019s what I gather. But there\u2019s a couple of things that don\u2019t quite line up with that-\n\n- when Tom goes to visit Katie at the newsroom, she mentions Bill\u2019s murder, which I could have sworn takes place around the same time as Tafts lecture since they\u2019re getting questioned when it happens?",

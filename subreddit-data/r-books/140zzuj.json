    "postText": "One of my favorite parts of browsing used bookstores is looking at all the old covers. In the '70s, '80s, and '90s even terrible books got great covers. Romance novels that are unreadable and horror novels without a single scare in them still look like movie posters. Now when I google \"New York Times Bestsellers\" even the volumes which the publishers have put all their design money behind look so bland. Has anybody seen a book in the last five years where just the cover got you to buy the book?",

Wrote the names in sharpie on the spine. Not recommending this but a reminder to heed the old saying about a book's cover, no matter how discouraging a trip to a new book store may me.\n\nThat being said, maybe this is all the more reason to dig into some of the classics- and support your local used book store while you're at it ;-)",

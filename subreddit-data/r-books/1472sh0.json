    "postText": "It took me multiple months to get through it, but I finally finished Eco's The Name of the Rose last week. It was absolutely beautifully written and I was utterly engrossed in the long-winded discussions and debates surrounding the state of the church and it's various different religious orders and heretical movements in the 14th century. Both Adso and William were compelling characters, and their relationship was incredibly charming. It was far from an easy read though, and I struggled to find times when I was in the mood to pick it back up.\n\nThe part where it kind of lost me was the mystery. I'm willing to admit that this might be a personal failing rather than the book's, but I just found myself unable to follow it most of the time. I was confused as to why William was so insistent on repeatedly sneaking into the library to uncover it's secrets, as a way of uncovering the murderer. Maybe this is meant to be read as a failing on William's part, but it seemed to me like he ended up becoming far too obsessed with recovering the lost book (which for all he knew could've been just another unimportant volume) to the detriment of his goal of stopping the killings as well as his political mission of reconciling the Franciscans with the Pope. Ultimately, the mystery's resolution was really satisfying, but the journey to that resolution kind of lost me. I thought that William and Adso gossiping with each other and various other monks about theology and church politics was much more engaging than the actual mystery for most of the book.\n\nThe book's ending has left me feeling a little empty and depressed too. &gt;!As funny as the mental image of an elderly monk madly stuffing his face with pages of an ancient manuscript is, William's failure to prevent the destruction of Aristotle's lost treatise shocked me. And then the entire library and monastery burning down in the aftermath horrified me. I know it's a fictional story, but the loss of such large repository of ancient and medieval knowledge effected far more than any of the deaths did. The mystery is solved, but it's ultimately completely meaningless. No lives are saved, and in fact many additional lives are lost. William and Adso's intervention only ended up making things much worse. Maybe this was foolish, but I just wasn't expecting such a bleak ending.!&lt;\n\nI've been ruminating over it for the past several days now. I feel as though I might be missing something that Eco was trying to say with the ending, but I haven't been able to arrive at any conclusions. I've read a theory that it's meant as a critique of detective fiction, but I've not sure myself. I'd be interested in earing other people's thoughts.",

            "comment": "Brilliant book. The mystery part is OK and the least important part of it, but it's by no means a bad mystery. I'm not sure what confuses you about William's route, though, every single clue pointed to the mystery being related to the library in some way and in the end he was correct? The library was obviously hiding secrets and so he uncovered them as best he could. But ultimately his roundabout steps were, like the ending, kind of the core theme of the book:\n\n&gt;!That is, that truth isn't actually knowable, and that truth alone won't really solve anything, either. William has several speeches on this, one right before or after the fire, I forget, where he goes over this and Adso says something like \"so what's the point?\" And the point is there sometimes isn't a point. We can have brilliant people like William, we can make signs that point to truth in some way (this is a semiotics book, after all), but we can't actually represent the truth in an \"objective\" manner. That's why William fails to actually solve the mystery until it's obvious and way too late. I wouldn't say they necessarily made things worse, though. They did put an end to it all and the old guy got his just desserts, it just wasn't meant to be an idealistic ending. But also, the point is that the library burning was a tragedy, but not that big a tragedy. After all, these books, this vast trove of knowledge, existed only to be hoarded, and that was the whole problem with the Catholic Church AND the Empire in the novel: they were only interested in hoarding knowledge, wealth, and power, not in actually helping the common people. All these books were meaningless if they did not reach or help the average people, the \"simple\" as they called them in the book. The library burning was tragic, but it was also a punishment for the hubris of the monks!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Naturally, when you say, \"actually the truth wasn't really that important in the end\" you're necessarily engaging with the core idea of detective fiction. William is brilliant, he and Adso make a good Sherlock Watson pair, but ultimately it's not detectives that will save humanity. So, yes, it is a deconstruction of sorts of the detective story while also being a loving homage to it.!&lt;",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the thoughtful response, this is exactly what I was hoping for when I made this post!\n\nI think this might be a failing on my part, but while the secrets of the library were intriguing, I somehow missed the specifics of the connection between the library and the murder mystery until pretty late in the book. It just didn't seem like the best possible lead - as though they were chasing after an intriguing side mystery, rather than following alternate paths which might have solved the murder plot sooner. Again that might just be my flawed perception based off of missing important information though.\n\n&gt;!I think might be referencing the conversation William and Adso have right after the monastery burns down, where they share a collective crisis crisis of faith. That was one of the bleakest and most powerful moments for me. After everything, the two monks are left questioning if God even exists at all. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Great point regarding the flaws with the Monastery's approach to hoarding knowledge! You could argue that of the books sitting untouched and unread were effectively dead to the world anyways. It's just hard for me to read about the destruction of historical sources without sheading a tear. You're also right that the plight of the \"simple\" and how they chafe under the tyranny of prince and prelate alike, was a thread that repeatedly came up throughout the book but it wasn't something I connected with the inability of William (or detectives in general) to enact meaningful change. Interesting. !&lt;\n\nI think you've structured of my thoughts regarding the book's underlying message in a much more clear way. I found it fascinating, but I struggled to keep it all straight in my head sometimes. I definitely plan on revisiting this book again sometime in the future. Thanks again!",

This is all within the first like 100 pages and served to guide  both William and the reader towards seeing this place as key.",

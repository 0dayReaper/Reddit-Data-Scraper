    "postText": "Recently finished reading 'The Silent Patient' and I admit I was taken off guard by the twist in the end. I am but certain that the end twist certainly wasn't able to explain the reason behind Theo being desperate to help Alicia. I read that Theo helped Alicia despite the risk, that was because he geniunely felt bad for Alicia and knew that he is responsible for all that happened to her. This explaination still renders me unsatisfied because why would you help a person recover when you know that   that person has all the reasons and capability to expose you if she recovers. This explaination indicates that either Theo is truly a stupid character or an insane man. \nAnyways, looking from this perspective, I am getting a sense that the author of this book was himself pretty fascinated by the twist and knew that the audience would be caught off guard, he was so overwhelmed by this twist that he completely overlooked how cringe the unexplained things would seem to a reader",

            "comment": "I don't think Theo ever actually wanted to help Alicia. He wanted to satisfy his own personal curiosity for why she reacted the way she did after he left the house. I think he also enjoys the amount of power that he has over her and the knowledge that even if she did talk no one would believe her. He's obviously delusional and could very well believe that he is trying to help her when his motive is far more twisted and selfish.",

The writing itself was just OK but \"the twist\" was, i.m.o., predictable and honestly, I found Theo insufferable.   \n\nTbh, I never thought he was trying to help her. Before figured out their connection, it seemed he took Alicia's case for his own ego. Once it clicked, the story really fizzled and flattened for me.",

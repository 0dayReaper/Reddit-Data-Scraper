    "postText": "Finishing Young Mungo by Douglas Stuart, I just wanted to write a bit about how the book left me. I rode the waves of anxiety and joy with such fun. Stuart had so many telling metaphors/similes that personalized the text so well, where each use told us something deeper about the main character, Mungo. I experienced the formative experience to love and its heartbreak, and I can't thank authors enough for exposing me to the lifeworld of these characters, especially Stuart here with James and Mungo. The prose was definitely unique; I think Stuart relied on the reader's imagination more than his telling of events, but I'm still trying to figure out if that was the case. There were moments when my anxiety surrounding events was too much, and writing this feels therapeutic regarding that whole journey I just took. I had to read it in one day because since the beginning it felt like the book was being written by some thread of nostalgia, as if I've lived these experiences before. He violently juxtaposed intimacy and brutality, building this complex lifeworld of manifested innocence. Ugh... still reeling--I will prob update soon.",

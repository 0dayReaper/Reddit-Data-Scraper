I do also enjoy horror in general!\n\nIt was a year or two ago I think. I can\u2019t exactly remember. I was just scrolling KU for some new z reads and I come across a zombie outbreak book. Nice, I thought. I looooove outbreak fiction.\n\nSo I read it. And I didn\u2019t stop until I was done. Wow. I really liked it. After that, I followed the author and consume any book she puts out.\n\nI didn\u2019t really have a favorite author before this. I do really like Mira Grant though.\n\nHow about you? How did you find your favorite author?\n\nETA: lol forget to add the actual author\u2019s name. Alice B. Sullivan.",

In one of the podcasts with Jordan Peterson they mention the brothers Karamazov being the best book ever written and they came to the conclusion that is was one of the best Russian novels ever written. Which peeked my interested, seeing 2 phd level people talk about a book in such high regard.\n\n\nWhen I finally got around to reading the brothers Karamazov (still not finished started a month ago) I was in awe of how elaborate the book was and how it touched on a ton of topics from religion to the 1860s Russian life. You could say I fell in love with the style Dostoyevsky wrote because it was so specific and vast at the same time.\n\n\nTLDR: hated reading my middle school and freshmen year of hs.

The religious aspect is only part of it, and it's a very dense literary novel, indescribably weird and inventive magical realism - would be a very strange approach to writing a novel meant to offend religious believers. One Hundred Years of Solitude features some Christian beliefs and characters, as well, while being at least equally magical realism weirdness - isn't it natural their religious/cultural background might be something a writer would draw on?\n\nYou can disagree with the first poster's use of language and how it could be seen as generalising all Muslims (though that isn't necc. what they meant) without suggesting that Rushdie deserved this, or downplaying his status as a writer.",

Based on that memoir, would expect the odd anecdote about other writers/famous people he knows and acknowledgements of those who helped...and maybe a bit more 'told you so' score settling!\n\nHis novels have almost been really misrepresented. They might be a bit overwhelming to those not used to literary novels and *especially* magical realism, but it's not mentioned nearly enough that they're actually funny, fun to read. Reading The Satanic Verses tends just to make it more puzzling why the fuss. When I first heard about it I had the impression it was some kind of dry criticism of religion, while it's actually a near-impossible to describe (so, these two actors of Indian origin fall out of a plane over the English Channel and one takes on angelic characteristics while the other takes on demonic and that's not even the half of it) crazy trip with the religious aspect being minor in comparison to the ideas about identity. Would say Midnight's Children (the Booker of Bookers) is a bit more accessible, it mostly explains the political background, and is at least a somewhat more normal family saga albeit still magical realist, while The Satanic Verses is so weird in places I never really knew what would happen.",

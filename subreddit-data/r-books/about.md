Description:

This is a moderated subreddit. It is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage in-depth discussion about all things related to books, authors, genres, or publishing in a safe, supportive environment. If you're looking for help with a personal book recommendation, consult our Weekly Recommendation Thread, Suggested Reading page, or ask in r/suggestmeabook.

Rules:

Discussion is the Goal: Rule 1: All posts must be directly book related, informative, and discussion focused.

Uncivil behavior: Rule 2: Please use a civil tone and assume good faith when entering a conversation. Please conduct yourself as though in a family-friendly environment. Do not use obscenities, slurs, or gender-charged insults.

Incivility will be met with a warning, and repeat offenders will be banned.

Recommendation Requests: Rule 3.3: Requests for personalized recommendations or suggestions are not allowed. Post instead to our Weekly Recommendation Thread (always CSS stickied at the top of any /r/books page), /r/suggestmeabook or /r/whattoreadwhen. Also try /r/booklists or our Suggested Reading list wiki page. Posts asking users to list their favorite/the best book of a genre, style, etc that don't include an answer and why in the body will be assumed to be recommendation requests and removed. 

What's That Book Called?: Rule 3.4: "What's that book called?" posts are not allowed. Post instead to /r/whatsthatbook or /r/tipofmytongue. 

Promotional: Rule 3.1: Promotional posts and/or comments need to meet the promotional rules requirements: [please see the wiki for more details](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/promotion). This includes surveys and market research. 

If you are posting your own content, you must meet  all other /r/books rules, you must meet the 9:1 ratio, you must make it a self-post and you must be up front in the title that it is your own work.

Distribution or solicitation for pirated material: Rule 3.6: No distribution or solicitation for pirated books. We aren't telling you not to discuss piracy (it is an important topic), but we do not allow anyone to share links and info on where to find pirated copies. This rule comes from no personal opinion of the mods' regarding piracy, but because /r/books is an open, community-driven forum and it is important for us to abide the wishes of the publishing industry.

Unmarked spoilers: Rule 3.9: If you do not mark your post or comment as having spoilers it will be removed. Any posts with a spoiler in the title will be removed. 

Spoiler tags in comments are done like the example below if you are using markdown or use the built-in spoiler tags on the redesign.

How to spoiler tag:
\&gt;!spoiler here!&lt; displays as
&gt;!spoiler here!&lt;

Homework help request: Rule 3.12: Obvious requests for homework where the OP has done little/no work will be removed. As an alternative there is /r/HomeworkHelp. Please read their rules before posting over there. 

Image-Only/Video-Only: Rule 3.2: No memes, image-macros, image-only, or video-only posts. You may make a self-post and include with it an image or video, keeping in mind Rule #1. Please note: shallow posts are not allowed but you are allowed to post if you give some information of elaboration along with the image.

Low Quality Book List: 3.8: No low quality book lists (eg: Buzzfeed). To maintain quality, the list must encourage discussion. The list itself must have descriptive paragraphs for each book. Users are also encouraged to submit their own unique lists as a self-post. Alternatively, there is /r/booklists.

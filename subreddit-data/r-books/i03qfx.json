Never really watched the TV show at all. But a bit of time had passed since I read the last one, and Winds of Winter was due up soon, so I said, \"Man, this story is so big, I think I need to reread everything so I can prepare for Winds of Winter. I better bust my hump to get them all read before the book comes out next year.\"\n\nI think that was maybe 2014?",

I'm still kind of not ready to give up completely; But then, I also waited patiently for WoT to finish. Of course, I don't think Jordan ever hit delays the likes of a Martin - who's closing in on 3DRealms, the absolute champions of vaporware.\n\n\nlate edit: Since a lot of people asked: WoT is The Wheel of Time, an epic-length book series by Robert Jordan. He sadly died before he could finish it, but handed the work over to Brandon Sanderson, who did an (in my eyes) exemplary job writing the conclusion.",

They wouldn't have had to rely on as many of those little conveniences (fast travelling, etc.) and take the time to let the characters breathe and show how they feel. On paper, I'm willing to accept Jaime as a tragic character who couldn't pull himself away from an abusive relationship, I'm willing to accept Dany losing her mind, but without the necessary setup in the show both just come across as random heel turns.",

We just missed 3,000 pages worth of development to get there. Apparently George RR Martin doesn\u2019t know how to get there either unfortunately. \n\nSide note, I\u2019m not certain if Sansa ends up Queen in the North or some Vale/North hybrid.",

The big issue with the show using Martin's ending is that the show had diverged quite a bit from the books by the end of season 5, and the characters motivations no longer lined up with their counterparts in the books. I think Martin could easily pull off that ending with the way his characters are going in the books, especially since he is supposed to have a whole other book after Winds of Winter to get everything in place for the series to end.",

And while Sanderson isn't writing crusader kings level political intrigue like GRRM, I think his magic systems are complex and show a pretty high level of world building. At a minimum I think qualifies as a \"good writer.\"",

His fantasy writing class on his YouTube page is actually quite informative and a great resource.",

If I remember correctly his wife chose not to tell her and just talked to her about the book and why she loved it so much instead. Then invited her for dinner to surprise her with meeting the author of her favorite book, in all the years since then they have all kept in contact and in a collection of short stories he actually wrote a short story based in Elantris with that girl featured as the main character of the short story. It\u2019s been a long time since I heard about it but I thought it was a pretty cute story.",

But I would have waited until book 3 comes out. \n\nRothfuss isn\u2019t as old as GRRM, so I\u2019m more confident that he\u2019ll finish eventually. But the problem is that if he takes another five years or more to release book 3, I will honestly probably have forgotten about the series. I won\u2019t even be paying attention anymore. \n\nThey\u2019re great books, but there are plenty of other great books out there too.",

He made his money, he can do what he wants.  \n  \nBut fuck anyone saying that we have to respect that decision. He *can* do that, but it's still a HUGE dick move, and anyone has a right to dislike him for it.  \n  \nIf you take Storyteller as your profession, then people have every right to hate you if you don't finish a story that you start. You don't *have* to, but not doing it makes you an asshole, and makes people calling you and treating you like an asshole justified.",

If readers don't have the expectation a series will be finished, they won't buy the first book in the series. And if the first book in series don't sell... well, pretty soon there won't be series at all.",

I had a mental log of all the mysteries in the books. I re-read the books several times. I had discussions about the show. I talked to strangers about it. I'd talk to friends about it. I'd find someone as into it as I am and talk for hours about it.\n\nBut now? The cracks were visible in season 5. By the end of season 8 the show turned into a pile of shit. A soulless nothing - a pop culture milestone perverted and betrayed. Everything was shit. And the worst part is they may have given away the ending to the books.\n\nDude took so long I legit do not care anymore. At all.\n\nI dont care about any new shows because even if they are amazing they can turn to shit on a dime. I dont trust HBO with that universe anymore just as I dont trust anything D and D do to be worth spending money to watch.  I dont care about the books anymore because its been so long and its already had parts of it given away.\n\nI still feel a personal dislike bordering on hatred for the show runners D and D, and I'm not sure I would even buy GRRM a pint at this point. The legacy of GoT is like a character from ASOIAF, great potential murdered by forces outside of its control before a goal realized.\n\nIn my mind, everything ASOIAF related is filed under \"Oh, what could have been\"",

That we could imprison him in a castle if he was not finished with TWOW by today. It looks to me that he's making fun and mocking all the people who read his five ASOIAF books and are waiting for the sequel.",

He doesn't talk about it at all. I think if GRRM took that approach it might actually be easier\". And now here is a great example of why GRRM makes it difficult to be a fan.\n\nLike, I get that this sort of thing takes time. And I'm usually on the side of \"author doesnt owe you shit. Be glad for what he has given you\". But every time this guy opens his mouth and makes a new promise, dumbass over here starts reading \"a dance with dragons\" again, in preparation.\n\nHe did it again recently. He had a post on his blog saying that lockdown has given him great energy and he is tearing into the book. Fuck me. I've read ADWD like 4 times at this stage. I can't do it again. Dont give me hope George. Just say nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanderson is over there giving me gantt charts for his next book. He's on timelines set in granite. He's telling me what his next 3 books are going to be and when they'll be released, and I believe him, because he's super reliable. We don't deserve him...",

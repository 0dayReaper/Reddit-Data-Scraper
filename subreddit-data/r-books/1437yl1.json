It's a warning which demonstrates that you have the ability to organize collective action, and the will to carry it out for at least a day or two. A real strike is a last resort for normal employees, who actually need the company to stay in business (though it's debatable whether that applies here). This is one of many negotiating tactics that could precede or help avoid it.\n\nBut slapping them on the wrist and going back to normal can't be the *whole plan*, and that seems to be how a lot of subreddits are treating it; I haven't seen them talking much about what comes afterward. It doesn't read like a warning of things to come; it reads like people are trying to do the bare minimum. And the fact that it's happening *at the same time* that other subs are announcing an indefinite strike/boycott is especially bad messaging. It comes off as though we really tried to organize an indefinite strike and people refused to take it seriously.",

The early concern was that if we went immediately from zero to full indefinite blackout, this would be perceived by the admins and users as effectively a mod tantrum. To combat this we formed a strategy of distinct escalation of pressure on the admins. It started with the open letter and having subs sign on to that. We've been reaching out to build coordination among other subs and spreading our message so the users know the issue and the stakes. It's going now to a week's notice  for a two day shutdown to build pressure on the admins and generate media attention (consistently the only reason reddit ever changes course on things). The current plan is to run the two day shutdown and see where things like, but I can tell you that basically every single mod in the planning discord is completely down to go private indefinitely if the two day shutdown does not work.",

It's pretty clear this is the direction they want to go in, and if 2 days of moderately reduced user activity costs them less than a \"forever\" of having no 3rd party software, then they'll just push through it.",

There's a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/13p889x/reddit_admins_were_just_caught_using_bots_or_fake/) in  [r/SubredditDrama](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama) about what the Germans have uncovered and the same happened in [r/france](https://www.reddit.com/r/france). Basically, Reddit admins invited users among the most active to populate small or newly created subreddits that are carbon copies in French or German of popular subs. It happened 2 weeks ago, I'm pretty sure other languages were targeted.\n\nUsers soon have discovered those subs are mostly inhabited by fake accounts or bots, that it's filled with fake threads badly translated from old, even very old posts in English. It's not only the posts, but also the comments that are made by bots/fake accounts.\n\nMoreover, there's an artificial massive increase of members in some of those communities, to the point it's [ludicrous and infuriating](https://i.imgur.com/wCN90sj.png). +35k users in each, in the same period of time, less than a month, [r/bonjour](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonjour) being the test run. Compared with the already massive bump caused by [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place), it's insane.\n\nBasically, Reddit admins are astroturfing non English subs with falsely inflated numbers, possibly with Reddit's IPO in sight or simply in an attempt to attract new users. They did it in the past when Reddit started.\n\nEither way, admins have created fake places or transformed small communities into voids. In there, the Dead-Internet Theory is real: every user is a bot.\n\nSo yeah, Reddit wants to look good for investors and doesn't care about users.\n\nGo dark.",

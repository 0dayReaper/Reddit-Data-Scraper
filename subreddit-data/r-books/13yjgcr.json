    "postText": "I'm about 1/3 of the way through the book and I'm truly flabbergasted why this book is highly popular.  The language is so juvenile and uncreative.  I've rolled my eyes so many times I'm starting to just look out the back of my head.  I've had multiple people recommend her books and I just don't get it. Admittedly I'm not usually a romance reader,  but it feels like even for the genre it's particularly bad. Even the sex scenes are weakly written. To me, it feels how a teen boy imagines what sex is like for adults, without ever having sex.\n\nI don't know maybe I'm being harsh... but I think this is one I'm just going to have to give up on.",

That said it was fine for airport entertainment on audible when you\u2019re half listening, but it wasn\u2019t a good book. The \u201cshocking twist\u201d left me very frustrated, and apparently that\u2019s her whole schtick. To be clear, shocking twists are fine, the issue is when you write a book one way, spending all this time on plot and character, then trot out this plot twist that doesn\u2019t fit anywhere at all. It felt like the way I\u2019d write a short story in middle school and need to wrap it up in half a page. Just make something up, nothing matters bc the whole story is made up, make it work!",

It felt like you could really see CoHos own views seeping to the book, and it felt like massive shade towards DV victims who don\u2019t let their abusers see their kids.\n\nI think that part of the plot also showed the complete lack of growth Lily had. What do you mean she knows he\u2019d never hurt the kid? He pushed you down stairs?? And hit you because you laughed when drunk?? He would absolutely hit a child, if his personality the entire book was anything to go by.",

She might know how it affected her mother on the outside, but she clearly doesn\u2019t know the extent of what her mother must have felt in specifics, and she doesn\u2019t know the first thing about the dynamics of an abusive relationship, evidently.\n\nAlso I feel lowkey bad for her mother if the book is based on her relationship- it\u2019s fairly obvious (in my opinion), that she sees her father as a redeemable character or finds his actions somewhat excusable.",

(Literally any romance author)\n\nBad writing with a great plot makes a bad, but still enjoyable book. (M. Sinclair and plenty other paranormal romance authors)\n\nBut CoHos plots suck. Badly. Bad writing with worse plots makes for an all around shitty book.\n\nIt\u2019s everything about her books. From the characters (Lily Blossom Bloom and her steampunk flower shop), her relationships (Atlas, who basically counted the seconds until Lily was past the age of consent to fuck her), The shitty composition and pop references (letters to Ellen at inconvenient times), etc.\n\nHer complete lack of understanding on how abusive relationships work is what really put me off. I\u2019ve heard that either she or her mother went through an abusive relationship, but she still really should have done her research before writing a book.\n\nThere was 0 effort put into the relationship between Lily and Ryle. Where was the manipulation? I know abusive relationships look different with everyone, but there\u2019s always manipulation. It\u2019s why people stay. The guilt tripping was hardly there, and the abuse itself was so surface level that it was almost laughable.\n\nTo compare it to a book that\u2019s also very popular, My Dark Vanessa, it\u2019s completely lacking. In My Dark Vanessa we can see through the perspective of the victim, just like in IEWU, but the difference is that you can actually understand why she stays and why she doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019s being abused. The manipulation is plain to see, but the readers can still empathise with the victim and see why she can\u2019t see it. \n\nI\u2019m not great at explaining this shit, but yeah. I don\u2019t like that book and don\u2019t get the hype.",

Honestly,  I have seen hardcore pornography that was better written.  And yet it has sequels. And film adaptations! \n\n I suspect books like SoG and IEwU  attract a larger audience because it's embraced by the \"occasional\"  reader who isn't concerned with things like continuity, structure, vocabulary, and logic. They just know the book is everywhere and they are afraid of being left behind so they jump in. And ironically, they now feel pretty proud of themselves, because they  assume popularity and hype are indicators of meaningful literature.  This could be the reason they are only \"occasional\" readers . They don't know any better.",

But my favourite contemporary romance books at the moment are anything by Emily Henry, the Bergman Brothers series by Chloe Liese, or the Brown Sisters series by Talia Hibbert. But these are all a lot more cheerful, so if what she loves about those books is the angsty drama these aren\u2019t going to hit the spot!",

Is it still good if someone goes on to read only subpar work? I am not judging the person in this hypothetical but simply feel saddened that better written, more evocative literature is left aside, the general public not being exposed to these works with the exception of those who look for it. I compare it to junk food. Yes it\u2019s convenient, it\u2019s everywhere and it\u2019s easy. You see the ads for it everywhere, and everyone eats it. This doesn\u2019t mean we should say all food is relative, let people enjoy what they want and that\u2019s that. We should not grow complacent when it comes to our health right? In my opinion, it\u2019s much the same with what we consume with our minds. Great works or even good works of literature challenge the reader and benefit the mind as much as eating a balanced diet benefits the body. I think it\u2019s good that someone can get into reading through these books, however, I think they will miss out on experiences that I think are so beautiful that it would be a shame for them to never have them.",

It took a while to get going, but it was an easy and quick read and I liked the way it explored intergenerational trauma and abuse.\n\nThat being said, I'm not the target audience for her stuff and I have no desire to read the sequel or any of her other books.\n\nI see my students reading books though, and that makes me very happy.

I\u2019d rather hang out with a Hoover fan than the people in this thread who feel better about themselves because they don\u2019t like a book? I read It Ends With Us and it was actually very similar to my own romantic/abusive relationship. I didn\u2019t feel like a \u201cteen boy\u201d wrote it.

I think Colleen Hoover appeals to a certain demographic of people\u2014and I\u2019ll be honest\u2014when I see or hear people I know raving about the book, I think of them differently. After reading Verity and IEWU, I\u2019ve determined that this is the Colleen Hoover formula: weak character development, zero plot complexity with gaping holes, repetitive vocabulary and syntax to make it easy to follow, and an incredibly predictable outcome. I won\u2019t even get started on the romanticism of red flags and the glorification of the abuser; that speaks for itself.",

    "postText": "I'm curious to see if book tastes fall along similar divisions to movie and music tastes. I know there are plenty of people who say they love all genres of music BUT country, rap, EDM, etc. Obviously the same goes for movies where passionate movie lovers will often not watch anything too scary, too gory, musicals, etc.\n\nDo you have a book genre you just can't stand? For me it would have to be romance. As much as I try to take romance seriously, it's a genre I simply cannot get any joy out of. Actually, I should add a caveat that I have never experience a compelling heterosexual romance in any form of media, but especially books. My reasoning is that I don't really get to see queer romance in real life, and even in media it's quite rare (I know it's more prevalent than ever, but you literally have to start at 2015 before you can even see a healthy queer romance in movies not based in horrid stereotypes). But enough about movies.\n\nI think romance novels are shit. They're total shit. As a ghostwriter I've had to read popular romance over many years as requested by clients in order to emulate the style of a specific author. While the writing quality varies wildly between authors, and even kindle only authors easily outclass international bestsellers sometimes in terms of prose, I have never seen anyone write a quarter way decent heterosexual romance. Even the queer romance is simply fine and nothing mind blowing.\n\nI know romance novels are a massive, massive industry. Publishers can't put them out fast enough which is probably why the only ghostwriting contracts available regularly are for contemporary and historical romances.\n\nI have two theories of why they are so bad. The demand for new romance stories is so exorbitantly high compared to other genres that agents and publishers have a significantly lower level of quality they can accept because even a below average title can turn a profit. I would be willing to bet they are far more lenient with bad prose or poor editing if a kernel of a halfway decent story is in there.\n\nMy second theory is romance is not a suitable story telling trope. Real life romance is benign and uninteresting. It constitutes being dependable and spontaneous, but not in a way that creates a compelling narrative. A romance short story may work just fine, but there is no conceivable way a romance can last 80,000 words while being plausible and interesting. It's the rule of 2. A romance can be:\n\na. 80,000 words\n\nand/or\n\nb. plausible\n\nand/or\n\nc. compelling\n\nIt can be any two of these things but never all three. The only acceptable romance usually surrounds a much more interesting plot that is exclusive from the relationship. Real romances aren't interesting to the people outside the relationship. They are dates, texts, phone calls, gentle or explosive progression, opening up, learning who they really are, hiding the worst parts of yourself, learning to compromise or learning to suffer out of fear of loneliness, learning how to live with another human with their own personal needs, putting someone before you, doing what's better for the relationship instead of what's better for you, forgiveness, tenderness, fighting, hatred, love, quiet moments, holding hands, listening to the other person sleep.\n\nRomance is not explosions, guns, secret twins, a dowry, government agents, poison, corrupt real estate developers, the coolest guy from high school, the head cheerleader, the woman in a quiet town who owns a failing small business, a checkered past, fights that could be resolved with one conversation, unprotected sex.\n\nTl;dr Romance is not a narrative, and therefore romance is unfit to be novelized.\n\nI'd like to know what you think. Do you hate romance novels or novels from any other genre? I'm particularly interested in hearing from people who cannot enjoy fantasy or sci fi novels.",

    "postText": "TV has been the biggest offender these days, rife with reboots and remakes.  The recent past has seen lots of movies from the past remade, both past original scripts (horror movies from the 80s, anyone?) and movies that were based on classic stories (A Christmas Carol).  Cover songs are oftentimes some artists' biggest or most recognizable hits.\n\nBut how come we don't have someone tackling the rewriting and printing of the Harry Potter franchise, or War and Peace, or [insert literally any book here]?\n\nI'm not saying it hasn't happened - someone might be able to shoot off some examples right away when answering this question - but why *don't* we tend to see people rewriting and re-presenting past works of written fiction?  And I don't mean something that might be a classic tale passed down through generations presented in new form (say, for example, a printed story pretty much being The Odyssey in disguise, not unlike how O Brother Where Art Thou? was for film), but taking something that's literally an established print IP not unlike is done with movies, with TV shows, with songs, and reworking it with a modern or different slant?\n\nWhat makes books/printed stories so special?\n\n(And as I finish the post, I know it happens with comics books all the time, but I'm not counting that.)\n\n**ETA**: I am not talking about \"inspired by\" stories, or thinly disguised re-tellings.  I mean same actual characters.  The TV show *Bel-Air* has Will, Carlton, Uncle Phil, etc. from the original sitcom.  *Battlestar Galactica* from the 70s vs the 2000's is another example.  Rob Zombie's 2007 *Halloween* movie has Michael Myers, Laurie, Dr. Loomis from the original in '78.\n\nThere have been multiple versions of *The Shining* on TV and movies.  Same with *Dune*.  But why has no one taken those characters and instead of writing scripts to be made into TV or movies, sat down and actually rewritten the books themselves and published them?  What's so different about that kind of IP versus when someone takes someone else's song and rewrites it but adds different rhythms, extra sections, additional vocals and even lyrics, or sings the melodies differently?\n\nIs it purely a money thing (access to the IP)?  Scope?  Medium?\n\nWhy does *that* not happen with books?  I guess it has happened with Sherlock Holmes, and as some have mentioned The Hardy Boys.  But why nothing relatively recent, like has happened with TV and movies?  What differentiates books from movies and TV?  I know there's a difference, and that's what I'm trying to understand.\n\n**ETA2**: As I've read through the replies, I think both [u/ronjajax] (https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/145xyiy/why_do_we_have_remakes_of_tv_shows_movies_music/jnnk3cl/) and [u/phiwong] (https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/145xu1q/eli5_why_do_we_have_remakes_of_tv_shows_movies/jnncm0q/) have given the best answers yet, from a philosophical viewpoint.",

But unless something is authorized by the original author (or their estate) public domain books are about the only ones up for grabs. \n\nI see that fan fiction has already been mentioned, and it certainly includes books.",

Warner Brothers owns the licensing for DC, which is why they can toss out another Batman movie anytime they want. However, Sony still owns the licensing to Spiderman, which was why Disney had to negotiate with them to add Spiderman to the MCU, even though they bought Marvel.\n\nIt's why book adaptions fall through frequently when negotiating to be made into a movie, unless it's out of copyright the studio has to negotiate with the author (or heirs) to make something. See Amazon's Ring whatever... Amazon didn't license Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, or even the Silmarillion, they licensed the notes at the end of the Lord of the Rings... which ended up kind of knee-capping them in using stories and characters that are well known.\n\nIf an author doesn't like how something is going, they can pull the plug before everything is finalized. I don't know how many times there was a negotiation to make a movie/tv series from Dragonriders of Pern, but Anne McCaffrey kept backing out.",

But usually, if a work is still in the popular culture and it's in the public domain, someone has taken it and rewritten it in some way.\n\nAnd, as someone else pointed out, fanfiction is what you're referring to- which are works that are usually not in the public domain yet, but people want to rewrite or use elements from. The reason they're restricted to fanfiction is because officially publishing it would get them in legal hot water - and even then, there's been a couple of examples of people doing it anyway and just changing names a bit to skirt the issue.",

They can decide to reboot it and don't have to worry about stepping on the toes of the people who first made it, who likely won't be involved in the reboot. Technological advancements in these fields provide a good motive for remakes; even if you didn't change the plot, they'd still have a new appeal. The possibility of seeing new actors tackle a role adds star power. They're often hampered by budgetary constraints or studio demands; crucially, studios finance films (he who pays the piper calls the tune), whereas usually books are written and then sold to whoever will publish it. Broadly speaking, a few expensive films are made and expected to make money (franchising increases visibility), whereas many books are published cheaply, and only some expected to make money. \n\nBooks tend to be written by individuals. Writing has been around a long time, and stylistic innovation in the field is much slower. If you wanted to rewrite a book by a living author and publish it commercially, you'd have to convince them you could do a better job at writing their book than they did, or at least that you can bring something new to the table (graphic novel adaptations seem to be the most likely to succeed at this). Non-commercially, you're looking at fanfiction, which often does revolve around rewriting a book or sections of it, but obviously doesn't have the profit motive. Reader's Digest isn't so popular these days, but I'd argue abridged versions of texts do roughly fit here, and are much easier to produce than fully rewriting.\n\nLiving writers are often more interested in making new material, rather than reworking their catalogue (which likely wouldn't sell as well). Once they die, the rights pass to their estate, who tend to follow the same reasoning (plenty of licensed James Bond and Sherlock Holmes books, for example, but no rewrites that I know of).\n\nOnce the work hits the public domain it's fair game, of course. However, I get the impression people are more likely to filch characters from a book than to rewrite it in full, which is a lot of effort for something that's unlikely to sell well (particularly since people will have had so long to grow attached to the original). I think the cult of the author is stronger amongst book readers than it is amongst TV viewers, although it seems to be gaining strength in cinema. That said, abridged and children's versions of classic texts do exist.\n\nThere's also trends to consider: the YA market was dominated by Hunger Games knockoffs after it rose to fame; Jane Austen inspired fiction is practically a genre unto itself. Why try to sell a rewrite when you can change a few names and pass it off as your own?",

There\u2019s plenty of retellings out there, different POV or different setting, but a straight remake\u2014what does that even look like for a book? You can\u2019t change out actors/singers/settings/effects. Books are made entirely of words. What would it even mean to change all the words without changing the story (and still have it be accessible to the original audience, ie not straight up translate to another language)? \n\nThe best I can think of is something like rewriting a book in AAVE. But that\u2019s a bit gimmicky and books take a long time to read, compared to watching a movie or listening to a song, so there\u2019s the \u201cconvincing readers to buy this\u201d problem. \n\nThe other alternative would be \u201chaving a better writer just write the exact same book,\u201d but there you run into licensing problems, the fact that better authors probably have their own ideas and want to work on those rather than rewriting somebody else\u2019s mediocre book, and again the marketing problem. Fans of the original will cry foul at someone changing something they like (especially because books take a long time to read so the vast majority of future readers will only ever read one version), and if the book has too few fans for that to be a problem, then it also lacks a built-in audience to market to so what\u2019s the point?",

Some other movies are remakes because they are redoing them because we have better technology now, and don't have the limitations of technology like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nAlso how do you differentiate remake from retelling, and re-interpretation?

Someone else telling the same story like a cover song actually sounds cool, but I think others may be right about copyright.\n\nFor TV the reboots make more sense because camera and audio quality has gone up (not relevant to books) and there are new actors (again, not relevant to a book because there are no actors you see in a book). For video games, reboots almost feel necessary at times because of how much the video game industry has evolved. Even a 10 year old game being remade can yield success because of graphics and audio updates, or even controller modifications from the original.",

New scenes are not a substantial change. New actors, new animation styles, a new vision, are all substantial changes. And these changes require effort and time and (sometimes, but not always) creativity to implement. For example, every remake of an adaptation, like Dune, gives us a new filmmaker\u2019s interpretation of the story. They bring their vision to viewers, and their vision has unique qualities\u2014it is not the same as another person\u2019s vision. \n\nA remake of a book can\u2019t do that. If you use the same plot and the same characters, even once a book is out of copyright, all you\u2019re doing is adding your name to another author\u2019s blood, sweat, and tears\u2014their time and effort and creativity. There is no substantial change you can make without changing the story. You add nothing to that book and readers will see that as plagiarism. That\u2019s why retellings, which do make significant changes to plot and character, are more common in books. \n\nThe only time a \u201cremake\u201d similar to what you\u2019re describing happens in books is translations. The Odyssey, for example. That\u2019s because translations require interpretation. They are filtered through the translator\u2019s understanding of the language and the story, and the translator\u2019s skill. That allows numerous people to create markedly different translations.",

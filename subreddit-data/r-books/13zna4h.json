    "postText": "Ok ok, so hear me out. This was my very first Murakami novel and I was quite excited for it. Everyone I knew had been raving about it for quite some time and I was ready to love it, unfortunately though, that did not happen. \n\nThere were some things I did enjoy, I loved Nakata and his entire storyline. I thought it had a great touch of absurdity mixed with reality. He was quite a likeable character. I also liked Hoshino and Oshima as characters. I thought the world building was cool as well, the city within the forest, the talking cats, the raining fish, etc. I can see what people mean when they say Murakami is very whimsical and dreamy in his novels.\n\nNow, the parts that I hated. I couldn't get past the incest and the weird sex scenes. I have read novels with incest so I know it can be well done without glorifying it. However, while reading Murakami, it felt like glorification, like some absurd fantasy which ultimately (in my opinion) is wrong. Storylines that show incest isn't wrong, but I don't think we should glorify it.\n\nPeople have tried to explain it away by saying its a Japanese retelling of greek tragedy. I understand the obvious parallels to Oedipus, but where Sophocles succeeds, Murakami fails. What makes Oedipus interesting is the fact that he ***unknowingly*** slept with his mother. When he did find out that his wife was his mother, he felt an overwhelming amount of disgust and guilt to the point where he blinded himself. Kafka shows no remorse, guilt, or disgust. \n\nAnother explanation I've heard is that there is no certainty that Miss Saeki is his mother. Imo that doesn't matter, ***he believes*** she is his mother when he fantasizes about her and when he has sex with her. That's enough to make it wrong. Additionally when he dream rapes his sister, he refuses to get out because he decides he doesn't want to. When Murakami is describing it, he ends with saying that Sakura finds it pleasurable...that she actually finds pleasure in being raped. It's beyond disgusting to describe such an awful, heinous event as pleasurable for the victim. Regardless of whether its a dream or not, it feeds into victim blaming of women, (she enjoys it, she wants it, etc). \"But its just a dream\", does it matter though? In a world where the line between reality and dreams are blurred, after all isnt the whole point that responsibilities start in dreams?\n\nI also cant get past the age gap between Miss Saeki and Kafka, i've heard people say that its a cultural difference, that the Japanese age of consent is 13...that's not entirely true. While the national age of consent is 13, each state has the power to decide the age of consent. In almost all the states they define anyone under 18 as a child and having sex with a minor is considered a serious crime. This law also came into effect late 90's and it was a national issue, wayyy before Murakami wrote this novel, so he was well aware of the cultural shift in Japan in the perception of adult-minor relationships. So the fact that in the novel such a relationship is accepted so swiftly rubs me off the wrong way. \n\nAlot of people refuse to discuss these parts or choose to look the other way, I think thats problematic. Anyways, would love to discuss!",

I feel Murakami is one of those authors that you either love or hate.",

I see fiction as a sandbox in which people can explore different things, including and maybe especially those that aren't possible or allowed morally or legally in the real world.",

            "comment": "I enjoyed it but did get the ick so I agree.  I don't suggest that one for people.  Though I do suggest killing Commendatore.  Still writes women poorly and has a not great but also real ending that is just odd.  \n \nThat being said if you did not enjoy Kafka I would pursue any other Murakmi works as they all have kind of creepy old man writing. \n\nThat being said a theory that I hope is true is that he is writing in the way that the men in these situations think.  For Kafka he is an orphan (for most of the book) who never knew parental love (as his father was a dick) so I think he sexualized a sister who he thinks he has (as it is never confirmed)(also being attracted to people in your family is a normal thing for a child as they are raised being around them. They usually grow out of it by the time the are in highschool).  The age gap is gross I hated it.  And the fact that they do Yada Yada it away isn't great but.  It's not like Kafka really had a happy ending.  There is no catharsis that arises at the end. It's just a story arc that comes to a close. \n\nOnce again not defending the books interpretation of an oedipus complex nor the bad writing of women characters.  Just a theory.",

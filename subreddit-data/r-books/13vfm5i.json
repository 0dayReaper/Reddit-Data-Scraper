They do mention Nike Air, but the book ends at its launch in 1980, and only mentions that it had to be recalled for quality issues.\n\nI think the sequel would have to transition to be the history of NIKE vs Phil Knight starting in 1980\n\nIt could cover NIKE AIR, Jordan, the building of the Nike brand through the \"just do it\" campaigns and all the great ad's they put out in the 90's.  \n\nI think it would also allow them to discuss the child labour controversies, and their response etc.   \n\nI would read it if it came out",

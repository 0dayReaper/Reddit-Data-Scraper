In the late 60s my father was able to pay for an entire semester with only the money he saved from a summer job.\n\nEDIT:  Alot of people saying this is still possible if you work full time in summer and save every dime.  Theoretically yes you could pay tuition alone with that.  My dad lived alone, bought his own mercury Cougar, and still paid for his first semester of college every year.  Books and everything included.  Grandparents paid for the spring semester, that was their deal.",

Doesn\u2019t it discourage people from going to university?\n\nEdit: It\u2019s very interesting to read everyone\u2019s stories. From what I\u2019m gathering, a lot of people feel discouraged because they don\u2019t want a lifetime of debt, yet many of them feel the need to take out loans anyway because having a degree seems like the only way to get a job.

A lot of people point at the the 60s, 70s, and to a less extent the 80s as times when you could \"work a summer job and pay for college\". But that was still kind of true even through the early 90s. When I entered the college scene in 1993 a semester of tuition at most state schools was around $1400-1600. That was still manageable for most kids if they really tried. Today? No way anyone is paying their way through a 4 year education.",

She sees the world through rose tinted glasses especially when in comes to education. The idea that an educational institution might have profits in mind and not necessarily the best interests of it's students is unfathomable to her. In her mind the education systems are staffed only by the most moral and upstanding people even though she worked in public school administration and saw on a daily basis that this was not the case to the point she retired early to escape it. The cognitive dissonance is strong with her. Don't even get me started on her political views because they're even more insane.  ",

I managed to finish my work at a community college by paying out of pocket, but I knew I had to take out loans for my last 2 years.  My dad screamed at me endlessly, saying if I hadn't wasted my money on this or that, I wouldn't have to get any loans, that he saved his money and spent it wisely and was able to graduate (in the 80s) from the same school I was going to completely debt free.  Finally I asked him how much he had to pay.  He said a semester was $300, including textbooks.  I showed him tuition now was over $3500/semester, not including books or parking.  He left me alone about it after that.",

Parking also trippled in price and they closed down any  \"free\" parking surrounding the university. \n\nThis major price hike was happening in the middle of the recession. On top of all that classes were being cut like crazy so I wasn't actually able to get into the classes I needed to graduate. I eventually dropped out because I was paying out of pocket and couldn't afford paying so much money for classes that were getting me no where. ",

Profs are aware of it more and more, they just assign free versions or get the library to stock more copies.\n\nEdit: up 10000% reading the BS a lot of people have to put up with. I swear it's time for some of you to mobilize and find new fangled ways to game the purposefully rigged system instead of just taking it. It's hard, I know.\n\nEdit2: To the folks asking for help with piracy, no that's against Rule 6 of the sub.

I taught a semester at a community college and inherited the book/syllabus because I was hired at the last minute (previous guy got a real job a few weeks before class started).  All I had to do to assign homework was flip through the website and click the boxes of the problems I wanted to assign.  A week later I go back and copy/paste grades into my gradebook.  Utterly ridiculously easy and I can believe that a lot of professors will happily let each student get reamed for $50/class to make their life simpler.  They could charge $200/student and plenty of profs would still do it.  \n\n\nPersonally it was all a big shock as someone who went through college before online homework was a thing.  We used to contact our profs for the next semester at the end of the previous one, then buy the textbook cheap in the \"used\" section of Amazon (back when they just did books).  I probably never spent more than $150 per semester on textbooks after my freshman year.",

It makes grading and tracking easier for the teacher than collecting everything and grading by hand, and it's also kinda convenient for students being able to just ctrl+f through a book and stuff.\n\nSome colleges had their professors leak that they were given incentives by the publishers to force books/access codes onto students for royalties. If the professors forces you to buy the $100 access code by only putting the homework online locked behind a website, they get told for every student they'll get 10% in pocket or something.\n\nAlso it's not just homework, but your tests and quizzes are sometimes on these websites too. So you quite literally will fail the class if you don't buy access. And they don't include it in the cost of the class :^)",

Anything undergrad has tons of resources all over the Internet, profs assign books but rarely teach from them (they are often just supplemental), etc etc. What matters is going to the classes and doing the course work.\n\nSum all of that together, and then you look at the textbook prices for a four month course and it's like... You've gotta be fucking kidding me. I've usually pirated the textbook and more often than not it goes unused for the course anyway.\n\nNow, things can be a little different depending on the course/stream/degree. I have the STEM perspective. Things were different in the philosophy courses I took, *although* many of those were classic philosophy texts and you could Project Gutenberg for free.",

A lot of professors assign specific books because they come coupled with online coursework and material (via one-time use codes) because it's easier than creating coursework from scratch. So often professors will assign books specifically for the online materials. Especially with the rise of adjunct professors teaching courses, they don't often have time to prepare as much to teach their classes so they just assign these books that come with the online coursework.",

And we actually use the books in lectures, and you wouldn't pass the courses if you didn't have the required books. ",

            "comment": "What a coincidence.  I just finished a meeting with a rep from McGraw-Hill.  She was trying to sell me on keeping their book for my courses (our department is moving to open-source, free books).  She claimed that this was the \"old model\" and that high prices only met their costs.  When a new edition was released, they had to charge $240 because rentals, used-books, and piracy meant that they wouldn't make any money the following years.  Which, as anyone who interacts with students can tell you, is false.\n\nOpen-educational Resources are great.\n",

However, companies like McGraw-Hills and others have hooked the entire educational system into this scam of doing \"quizzes/homework\"  online which kneecaps a lot of students who are financial strapped. And most of these online work can easily be done by the professors themselves. There must be a way we can get out of this trap.\n\nEDIT: these online work can't be done without buying NEW textbooks that have special access codes. ",

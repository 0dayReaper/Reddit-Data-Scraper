    "postText": "Atlas Srugged. I've heard about it many times across my life--as, i'm sure many people have heard of Ulysses, or Satanic Verses--but never read this, and so wanted to be able to say \"yeah, I've read it and...\\_\\_\\_\" I started with a healthy bit of skepticism. It's taken me \\~2 weeks to get to the end of chapter 7.Dagny and James taggert, owners of a railroad company, have a strange dynamic. James begrudges his sister the talent and capability of running a company, and seems to relish in causing managerial havoc as long as it causes Dagny anguish. Something something american economy is collapsing, and James wants to give to the poor. BAD, BAD JAMES LIKING MEXICO; it's only looters there or something like that. Where have we seen this in recent popular culture? Eddie Willers likes trees, Dagny is haunted by music. So were all of us, Dagny, until YouTube was around. It's OK.\n\nHank Rearden's family seem to be unlikeable charicatures; they don't seem to be made without much effort. There's SO MANY great ways that first family scene could have been depicted with more depth, but it feels like an impressionistic equivalent of a slash of paint topped by a circle to represent a person in the distance, intentially portrayed as forgettable and umimportant; we are being trained to think that \"unsuccessful\" people such as Paul &amp; rearedn's mother (was she ever named?) are not worth remembering. Dangerous narrative posturing.\n\nThe government is headed towards anti-competition and the \"looters\" are going to anyone that benefits from govt handouts (?) We, the readers, are being maneuvered to think that, in a(n unrestricted) capitalist society, activities will eventually be prodigiously productive and beneficial to all. The term \"progressive\" in this book seems to be slant-term for...progress towards government control?\n\nWe see an ever-increasing number of people quit their positions, adding to the idea the book's original working title was \"the strike.\" We see a strange legislation title: the \"Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule.\"Don't we see similar behavior contemporaraily, in Verizon/AT&amp;T/T-Mobile/Comcast, then with our streaming networks? Very strange that these predictions, feared by Rand, would have been precipitated by Alan Greenspan, [one of her \"disciples\"](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/greenspan-and-ayn-rand-disciple-or-traitor-2010-06-19).It feels oddly like, with the idea that the government, with the sanction of the general public, in passing this strange anti-competititve legislation, i'm being maneuvered into a thought of \"it's good to reject the consensus of the mass of people.\" Still, why have so [many \"conservatives\"](https://qz.com/882493/donald-trump-paul-ryan-and-andy-puzder-say-they-love-ayn-rands-controversial-philosophy-heres-what-us-republicans-keep-getting-wrong-about-it) that endorse Ayn Rand's principles still look to christian religion? Am I missing something?!?\n\nFrancisco D'Anconia is touted as a genius; this is why he wasted $15 million dollars to stick it to James Taggert and Orren Boyle, those conspiring men who wanted to \"loot\" from the handounts from Washington. Aight, cool. Musk bought Twitter for reasons, one among them so he could have a little more cover from journalists that have dogged his activities for years. And he's touted as a genius (or at least a genius-thief). Aren't many creators just thieves of ideas?\n\nI struggled through some narrative choices on the first \"lovemaking\" scenes:\"They were both incapable of the conception that joy is sin\" \\[...\\] \"She knew, even though she was too young to know the reason, that indiscriminate desire and unselective indulgence were possible only to those who regarded sex and themselves as evil\" (page 106). When was this book first published? 1957? Had our religious values been that oppressively...catholic in austerity towards sex back then, or is this more deliberate narrative steering?\n\nWhat's the most depraved sort of human being? \"The one without a purpose.\" Interesting idea. A person who has no goal to strive for can easily find their course altered by someone with a larger context, thus swept away by collectivist thought. I actually find this idea to be valuable. A nugget, perhaps?\n\nBy this point \"Who is John Galt?\" feels like it's a narrative MacGuffin. After all, he found Atlantis,  the place where heroes live in happiness unknown to the rest of the earth ([Ouray, Colorado](https://workandtravel.rs/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20121005-Ouray-Dusk-Lights.jpg) is generally accepted as where John Galt will lead us to). By the way, Here's the music we're supposed to hear for [Halley's fourth symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiDxFpdqxHc).\n\nChapter 6 is strange. Hank's only way of coping with a wedding is to project himself into a flow-like state, but the narrator perpetually drifts back to business. Lillian throws a party for their wedding...anniversary, but invites a bunch of \"looter intellectuals\" to use Dagny's words. Dagny happily exchanges her diamond-bracelet for the rearden-steel one. Hankey deals with guilt over having sexual urges, cause he doesn't need the wife, he just wants a woman's body to use the spooge. What is the purpose of this chapter? I imagine John Oliver screaming, YOU GOTTA LIVE A LITTLE, HANKEY!! FEEL SOME GODDAMN HAPPINESS!!\n\nThe employees treat Dagny worse as the book goes on. She's their boss, and they're second-guessing her left and right. Frightening that this still happens. Later, Dagny philosophizes with bums at a diner..hank rearden talks to a State Science Institute guy..Dagny and Eddie bemoan the circumspect criticism published about Rearden Metal, and a confrontation with Dr stadtler reveals a man bereft of personal conviction (effectively, the institute he runs issues a statement, but won't retract it despite the fact he disagrees). Odd that, in juxtaposing the hopeless wanderings of the bums--still perscpicacious enough to form an idea of morality--with Hank engaging a slimy and abstruse scientist--then the vague criticisms of metal, we're being primed to see or read \"social impact\" or \"social welfare\" and gain an impression of the exchanges and evaluations as being entirely irrelevant to useful measures such as practical business value or material wealth. Once again, as a reader, we're being maneuvered into thoughts that \"government and science are bad\" because they can interfere with--or limit--businessmen, and thus corporations.\n\nHere's an odd quote: \"Contradictions do not exist. whenever you think that you are facing a contradiction, check your premises.\" (188). I guess Ayn Rand wasn't a fan of Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Picture of Dorian Gray. Or the idea that I can hang out with a childhood friend, see them as they are now, but in my mind's eye, also them as they were when we'd first become friends; the two are different in time, character, and form, but also not.\n\nAnd then we have Ragnar criminal. A guy who really robs from the looters..?\n\nIDK if I can read any more past chapter 7. Send help.",

I don't recall what those were anymore.  She was popular back then &amp; even addressed West Point in 1974.  You can listen to it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXtS4FpW3mM&amp;ab\\_channel=AynRandInstitute\n\nIn all her books, the main points are simple with no ambiguity &amp; the longer the piece, the more times the exact same one is hammered home.  There is no subtlety.  Her fiction is all head &amp; no heart.\n\n\"Atlas Shrugged\" preaches that pure Capitalism is the only way to go.  Watering it down with any sort of collectivism just encourages laziness &amp; stupidity which will ruin our great nation.  It was written at a time when there was a big fight over the direction we were taking.  FDR had made big social safety nets for the first time &amp; they worked, but many felt like she did.  They thought they would encourage laziness. Her warning didn't work. Less than a decade after she wrote this, LBJ signed the Welfare Act.\n\n\"The Fountainhead\" has an even sillier premise.  I'm new here &amp; don't know how to put in spoiler tags, so I won't say what it is.  I'll just say the entire novel can be described in a few sentences &amp; they defy credulity.\n\nI prefer Rand's nonfiction, especially the shortest pieces.  She has some good ideas &amp; brings up things that should be examined. I even agree with her, at least partially, on quite a few. Her work also improves my vocabulary, although I have to be in the mood to enjoy that.  She never uses a common word where a $5 one can be squeezed in.",

Usually people who flee a revolution are on the wealthier side (even to be in a position to leave), including potentially those who have very directly made their wealth exploiting the poor and are perfectly aware of that. There were aristocratic supporters of the French revolution, and very heavy booj support, and when someone who was left was counter-revolutionary it shouldn't really be attributed to trauma, poor dears, so much as recognised as being why they left in the first place.

I think the issue with *Atlas Shrugged* is that it really doesn't have much to give aside from its politics (which only work even in-universe because the characters are cardboard cutouts) and the only people who seem to think it's amazing or revolutionary are (some of the) people who agree with her. \n\nCounterexample to Rand: I disagree with Robert A Heinlein, another devout libertarian, in quite a few ways and I've loved his work since I was eight. *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* is as fundamentally libertarian as *Atlas Shrugged* and also lauded by a lot of non-libertarians. It's one of my favorite books I've ever read. I'm sure some people have hated it but I've never seen anybody hate it because it came off as propaganda. Even *Starship Troopers*, which is philosophical to the point of almost being plotless, is unclear in how much of the philosophy was Heinlein's own views/propaganda and how much satire. Bring up the idea that it was propaganda in a post here and the discussion will devolve into what the true meaning of the book was, something that will never seriously happen for *Atlas Shrugged*. \n\n(just for clarity: I don't enjoy *Starship Troopers* much either, but for very different reasons than *Atlas Shrugged*)",

In the UK she's almost unknown, while Animal Farm is read in schools and people who haven't read Orwell still know who he was. I don't think it matters if someone doesn't read Animal Farm, there are a lot of books, but it wouldn't be accurate to suggest Rand is an important writer, she's not seen as a philosopher, not taken seriously within academic philosophy, and there are again a lot of books someone could be reading instead that are. Her work is also not seen as having any literary value whatsoever. Orwell is not really seen as *that* important a writer either (Animal Farm is an easy and short book so deemed suitable for kids to be assigned), he's of his time, but it's totally different from Rand's reputation.\n\nRather than getting unfairly picked on for her politics, she gets a massive unfair boost (to be fair Orwell also gets a boost to a lesser extent. Note the relative popularity of his works that are critical of communism vs. his clearly socialist work. The US far rightwing certainly doesn't seem under the impression Animal Farm is a distinct opposite to their rightwing Libertarian idol's work).",

That makes us better humans and better readers.\n\nThat doesn't work. You are overestimating your ability to be objective.\n\nCan you even explain what both sides are?",

Not just how well the book is written, how well it conveys said message, how well it sells, etc... . \n\nAnimal Farm has an anti-authoritarian message. And being well written and short really helps hammer it home. \n\nAtlas Shrugged on the other hand is promoting and American Libertarian ideology. But appeals to conservatives because of the messages it contains regarding hierarchy. Whether it's well written isn't too relevant. \n\nSlamming a book on the core thing it's trying to say is completely appropriate. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to understand their messages. But ignoring your own values while reading and judging a book isn't something that needs to happen.",

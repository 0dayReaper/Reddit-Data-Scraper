That way, when I go to the thrift/book stores, I know what I already possess (duplicate are mostly disappointing). \n\nWhat data should I collect for each? So far, I have book title, author, publish date, edition date (cause I\u2019m weird &amp; want to know which edition I have), genre, condition, # of pages, publisher &amp; the ISBN-10/13. Any other info that would be helpful?",

I would advise against having too much data. When managing data it's as important to decide what to have, as to what to let go, to make the objective/task easy.\n\nSo your choice looks good.",

It\u2019s all about the art deco features of the Quaglino\u2019s restaurant in London.\n\nI\u2019m desperate to get my hands on a copy, but that\u2019s all the knowledge I have of it. Does anybody know of it / know where I can get a copy / find more info?\n\nAnd it\u2019s not the colourful looking Quaglino\u2019s cookbook that appears in all the Google searches. This is a different book.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

When I went to go buy it, though, I noticed there are copies of the hardcover going for $50-60, and copies that go for $20-25.\n\nMight be a long shot, but does anyone know what the reason for this might be? I figure it might just be the condition they're in, since it seems like you can only get the book used, but it's still weird.\n\nOh, also, Dictionary of the Khazars: Does the androgynous edition include *both* of the texts, or is it something else? The listings for it don't actually say. I know the differences between the male and female versions are supposed to be small, but crucial, but obviously if I can forego buying two nearly identical copies of the same book to get that experience I feel I should try to.",

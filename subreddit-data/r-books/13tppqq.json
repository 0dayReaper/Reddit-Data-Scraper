    "postText": "What I hoped would be a fun, light, beachy read\u2026. was something else. \n\nThe main character, Belly, was exactly like those parody videos of the \u201cgirl who thinks you\u2019re in love with her\u201d. While listening to the audio book, those hilarious cringey videos were all I could think of and I just couldn\u2019t look past it. Belly was so unlikable and the story was just shallow and boring. \n\nI guess I realized that I have officially moved past simple YA summer reads. Need something with a bit more depth and character development.",

I completely agree; I genuinely couldn\u2019t comprehend why all these boys were falling head over heels for a girl with the personality of white bread. The manic pixie dream girl stereotype and the idea of \u201cI\u2019m not like the other girls\u201d is not only misogynistic but also just so overplayed and bland. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44",

Unfortunately, that desire was not fulfilled and I instead wasted my time watching a show with a dreary, boring protagonist, that overtly made herself disliked by me as a viewer. The show deteriorated throughout the episodes and subsequently, I felt that the idea of watching it felt tedious as to enjoyable.",

    "postText": "Being funny is surely one of the most attractive things a person can have and yet I can barely think of any characters who are attractive because they're funny - where the book isn't meant to be a comedy. \n\nI'm thinking in TV there is a lot of these characters (Jim from The Office) and obviously in a lot of sit-coms, Chandler from Friends etc. But I can't think of that many in books. I recently read (and loved) Sorrow and Bliss and I think Meg Mason did a great job of making one of Martha's most attractive traits be the fact she was funny. I would love to see that dynamic more.\n\n  \nWhy do you think it's not done more? Or does anyone have any examples of great characters who are attractive because they're funny? Men or women. Funny can also mean generally cheeky/not taking themselves too seriously etc. ",

It's as dark as it gets, a child is murdering his teachers, and the detective who's investigating has a son who's becoming friends with him. But scattered throughout the books are scenes that make me laugh, like the investigators internal musings, or mentions of her partner's upcoming date and whether he should buy a new deodorant or use the one with the hairs stuck to it. Or remarks from the detectives about how bad the verbal lashings from the boss were. Situational and social blunderings. The author peppered little light moments and I loved it. Lost my copy eventually and hunted down a new one a couple years ago. \n\nChameleon by Shirley Kennett.",

If I think of books I thought were funny, Then we came to the end, Catch 22, A gentleman in Moscow, White Noise. The characters are never knowingly funny.

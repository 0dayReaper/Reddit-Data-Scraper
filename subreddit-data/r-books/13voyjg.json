So imagine my disappointment when it only ended up being a new edition of Never Let Me Go with an introduction by the author of the article.\n\nthat said, does anyone else find it bothersome when lists like this serve almost as summaries of the book as much as reasons you should read them? For Never Let Me Go in particular the author reveals what I would consider to be fairly significant plot points that I'm really happy I discovered on my own during the book.",

The way Stevens tried to rationalize it, and the way he finally admits to himself and the reader that that was the reality of his employer, is a significant character development that I would hate to have spoiled for me.",

I have since read  and enjoyed The Remains of the Day and A Pale View of the Hills.\n\nI do hate when major plot points are revealed in a review or synopsis. When I recommend one of my favorite books, The Third Policeman, to people, I make sure to tell them to go into it as blind as possible and definitely don\u2019t read the introduction - it spoils what I feel the reader should find out organically.",

I found NLMG to be incredibly shallow. Almost as if it's a YA author attempting to write like Ishiguro. I guess everyone has different opinions but I really wanted to like NLMG and it's one of the most disappointing reads I've ever had.",

I think it is anything but shallow, and consider it one of the best books I have read in the last 20 years. It is masterpiece of understatement.",

Characters (to me at least) felt like they tried to be deep, but really weren't, and didn't have much growth or interesting aspects. It's interesting that you say it's a masterpiece of understatement because one of my gripes was that the characters felt like they were a lot of \"tell but not show\" vs the opposite being true in RotD (show, don't tell, or tell the opposite, due to masterful use of unreliable narration). Prose was extremely lackluster and felt like it was written by a completely different (less skilled) author. Themes were fine, pretty standard stuff for Ishiguro (memory and identity) but felt a bit redundant and obsolete after reading RotD. \n\nLike I said, I wanted to like it, but I loved RotD so much, I wonder if it set an unrealistically high bar for it. I'll probably give it another shot sometime soon.",

It reminded me a lot of The Sun Also Rises, except with different themes of course.  The real intention is never directly stated.  The characters always talk about other than what they really mean.  I thought it was very skillfully done.",

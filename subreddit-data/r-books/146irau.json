    "postText": "\u201cYou became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.\u201d\n\nI just finished this book after not reading much for a couple years, and it really reignited my love for the medium of books as an art form (compared to more visual media like movies). The book talks a lot about perfection especially in terms of Dorian Gray. \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling a lot with perfectionism both in my work and in daily life, just generally feeling disappointed when something doesn\u2019t meet the spotless, but vague, ideal I created in my head. This story is interesting because in the beginning, to the perspective of most of the characters Dorian meets, it personifies that perfection. You can actually look at it and touch it. And perfection isn\u2019t like that, I believe nothing real is actually \u201cperfect\u201d and therefore you can only have perfection in your mind, which brings me to the point of this post: books can be so powerful due to the lack of visuals. Any drawing or actor of Dorian would fall flat compared to the written descriptions of him. Having to imagine him in your mind makes him just like any other perfect idea - ideal, spotless, but a little vague. \n\nAnyway when there are so many really exceptional shows and movies out there it just made me appreciate reading again!",

It reignited my love of recreational reading after having it sucked out of me during school (from studying). Glad to see that it did something similar for you! \n\nIn case you are interested, there is an annotated version that is stuffed with extra background info (edited by Nicholas Frankel, to help differentiate from other versions). It's great if you are interested in the history around the book or knowing how contemporary readers might have interpreted it. It's massive compared to the book alone and is not entirely cheap. I have not finished reading all the annotations myself, but I'm really satisfied with it as a collector's item and thing that I can keep returning to.",

The characters and their ways of dialogues also left vivid impression on me, making re-reading each character phrases more than once, because everything in the story felt like carrying special meaning with it.\n\nAs I can remember, some characters here were written from author and that probably what makes them to be written so alive.\n\nIt\u2019s a very nice book, and I guess I will try to read other Oscad Wilde\u2019s books, you may leave recommendations below",

While I think there is probably some great visual artist who would be able to make a good adaptation of Dorian Gray (I'm mostly in the no-book-is-100%-unadaptable camp), so much of what I think makes it successful as a story is that we can only imagine what the images/people in the book look like.",

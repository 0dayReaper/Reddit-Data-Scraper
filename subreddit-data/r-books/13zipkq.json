    "postText": "So the *Count of Monte Cristo* is my all time favorite book, and I know many people agree with me that its is one of the greatest books ever. But can I put in a plug for Dumas's much lesser know *Georges?* It is very short, first of all. Second, it is his only book that really explicitly deals with themes of race and racism and has a mixed race hero. Third, it is like an adventure book on steroids. It is like 300 pages, but has duels, battles, slave revolts, pirates, shark attacks, hurricanes, interracial romance, revenge, etc.",

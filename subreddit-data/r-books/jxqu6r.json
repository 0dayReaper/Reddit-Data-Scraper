The Plaintiff\u2019s attorney makes an offer under Section 998, the offer is rejected.  Case goes to trial,  the Plaintiff wins more than the offer made under 998.  \n\nThe plaintiff would receive a \"reasonable sum\" to cover plaintiff's incurred expenses for expert witnesses and other costs.  In addition, Civil Code Section 3291 provides pre-judgment at the rate of 10 percent would be owed, which starts on the date of the first 998 offer.  \n\nOther states have similar provisions, and Rule 68 in Federal Court might kick in and shift fees as well.  \n\nSo it could be quite costly to reject reasonable offers when you don\u2019t have much legal standing, especially if the Plaintiff\u2019s attorney makes an early 998 offer.",

There is a provision that basically states that if an offer is made to the opposing party more than 10 days before trial and it is rejected, if the offering party prevails and the outcome is better than the offer, the declining party could be required to pay certain costs associated with the litigation.  \n\nSo if a Plaintiff made a 998 offer of $100,000 and it is rejected and after trial the Plaintiff wins and is awarded $100,001, they are entitled to offset some of the costs of litigation and interest from the time of the offer until the award.  \n\nPre-judgment is any thing that happens before settlement or before the court rules for one party or the other. \n\nRule 68 is part of the Federal equivalent. But in reverse the defendant makes an offer of judgement, if the Plaintiff gets less than that offer, costs can be shifted from Defendant to Plaintiff.  But I think there is an equivalent for Plaintiffs.  \n\nI should have also added rule 54 which allows a prevailing party to obtains costs and fees.  \n\nIt is far more expensive to take things to trial than people think, for everyone involved.  Plaintiffs either pay large percentages of their award (up to 40% depending on jurisdiction and costs associated with the litigation), or hourly plus costs, which can be astronomical depending on the complexity of the case. \n\nWhat most big companies hope for is to wear people down so they settle cases at a fraction of their value, while expending as little on legal fees as possible.  Also some attorneys\u2019 goal is to make it as expensive and drag it on as long as possible to force the  other party into submission.  Litigation is just extremely expensive, especially if it goes to trial.  That is why 99% of cases settle before trial as the risks and expenses are big.  \n\nAlso if every case went to trail it would grind the system to a halt.  And it gives the party with more money a bigger incentive to push cases to trial if because the risk / reward is unbalanced.  So, States and the Feds have implemented rules as an incentive to encourage settlements as early in the process as possible by making it more risky and expensive to push these things to trial if you lose.  And that is what these fee shifting provisions try to do.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, wealthy parties will always have an advantage because they can afford more litigation and can afford to wait out litigation.  Such as this case, they Plaintiff is older and seems to need the money, so they might cave for a fraction of what is owed.   \n\nI will note that I\u2019m more familiar with CA laws and very specific obscure Federal laws that I deal with all the fime than I am with the general Federal civil rules, but that is the general purpose of these rules.  \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing information or specifics but it the generally skinny of them.",

Disney is claiming that they acquired the IP rights but not the royalty obligations. Nothing that I've seen about them not being party to the original contract.\n\nSo, from my knowledge, the only way this is possible is if they structured their acquisition of the original licensees (I assume an exclusive license was granted by the author) such that a shell entity was left behind holding the obligations, because those obligations don't just evaporate. Someone owes these royalties still.\n\nMy thought from there is that this would be a case for fraudulent conveyance, unless they left sufficient assets with the other entity to pay those obligations.\n\nI dunno though, I'm an IP lawyer and I have an academic interest in contract law, but know very little about M&amp;A.",

It's what they did to Toys R Us.  It strikes me as fraud, but hey, what do I know?\n\nFrom what I've seen, though, most IP license contracts will have a clause that binds assignees, etc.  I mean, I'm surprised he hasn't filed a copyright infringement claim.  That'd get their attention real fast.  I mean, the underlying contract is in default with no royalty payments.  The license is an asset insofar as the underlying contract is upheld.\n\nEdit: I think I may have realized what happened.  It may not have been a license agreement at all, but a sale of IP with royalty payments attached.  Disney would be arguing the royalties attached to the original licensee separate from the sale of IP.  It's got maybe a 30% chance, but Disney likes to throw its weight around.  What are you going to do, sue them?  I still think his best bet is to file a suit for copyright infringement.  That kind of aggressive move is dangerous enough that Disney might back off after a couple of years and a few million in legal fees.",

We had been attending for a couple of years by then, and we had busted our butts to avoid loans. But we HAD been getting Pell grants (which never have to be paid back).\n\nWe knew how big our Pell grant checks usually were. This one was... a LOT more than usual. Like, $10k more. We were worried there has been a glitch and they had accidentally disbursed some LOAN money to us as well. Went into the office to clear it up. They assured us, \"no, that is all Pell grant money, you're good.\"\n\nWeek went by. Still didn't feel good about it. Went in again. And again. In all, went in like 3 times. Each time they assured us that it was 100% grant money, and didn't have to be paid back.\n\nWe spent it. Bought a couch and a tv. Banked the rest.\n\nSTILL didn't feel good about it. Went in one last time. They checked their system.\n\nClerk: \"Oh, no, I'm sorry, that is mostly loan money. You do have to pay it back.\"\n\nMe: \"WTF? I've come in here THREE TIMES, and was told repeatedly that it was GRANT money, that didn't ever have to be paid back!!\"\n\nClerk: \"Well I don't know who told you that. But I can't argue with what the system says. And besides (::smug grin::) you should have realized it was a loan when you signed your promissory note...\" \ud83d\ude0f\n\nMe: \"What promissory note? You have a signed promissory note from me?\"\n\nClerk: \"Just a minute, I can show you... :: typing on computer :: \ud83d\ude33 Oh my. There seems to have been an oversight. I need you to go down the hall and tell them you need to sign a promissory note for your file.\"\n\nMe: \"... ... ... I don't think I'm going to do that. \ud83d\ude10\"\n\nClerk: \"But you have to!

                    "comment": "I\u2019d like to point out that\u2019s traditionally the way that contracts work though. A contract is made up of two distinct parts: (1) a duty and (2) a right. A duty is a legally-binding promise to do something (or refrain from doing something). A right is the benefit of that duty. A right and a duty go hand in hand. We refer to these parties as the promisor (one who has the duty) and the promisee (one who has the right to enforce that duty). Most contracts involve an exchange of promises where one party is has a duty of do something and the other party has the duty to pay. Each party holds corresponding rights to enforce the duties of doing something or paying something, respectively.\n\nNow a party can transfer its right under the contract to another party. That\u2019s called assignment. The party assigning the right is called the assignor and the party receiving the right is the assignee. The assignee receives the right to payment *even though it has acquired no new corresponding duty*. We call this process \u201cassignment.\u201d \n\nThere is something similar with a duty, but it is distinctly different. A duty may be \u201cdelegated\u201d to another party, which sets up three parties: an delegator who has the duty initially, the delegatee who is assuming the responsibility of the duty, and the obligee who is entitled to performance of that duty. What is distinctly different here is that the duty to the original party is not terminated by delegation. An obligee *may* be able to enforce a contract between the delegator and the delegatee, but can certainly enforce a contract between the obligee and the delegator (the initial contract).\n\nI do not have enough information to say if that is the case here with Disney. But to flatly say that Disney had a duty to pay an author for works he created for LucasArts simply because Disney has been assigned the right to payment is incorrect. The author may be able to enforce an acquisitions contract between Disney and LucasArt as a beneficiary. The author most probably has a cause of action against LucasArt who in turn can sue Disney. But to say that Disney has a duty here\u2014without more information\u2014is flatly incorrect. \n\n*Note*: This relies upon a reading of Restatement (Second) of Contracts which is a common law codification of contract law. There are variation state-by-state. In addition, copyright law is federal meaning that there are undoubtedly special rules for that field of law that this author may not be privy to. The point here is to clarify a basic principle that someone who acquired rights under a contract does not necessarily acquire a corresponding duty to pay.",

If you're a hard core Star Wars fan and an author, if you want to make money writing about it, you have no choice but to talk to the Mouse.\n\nThat said, you're correct. Any company could destroy ANY contract at will with no recourse for the other party. You'd like to think it has no chance of prevailing. But its not worth even letting that idea have a day in court, just in.. case..\n\nI also wonder if it's not part of a long running attempt to get authoring as an industry to work more like animation.\n\nTalented artists create animation for the company and have no license or copyright to the works they create for their employer. While some books are like that, I think the industry as a whole still views the book as the author's work, rather than the company's.\n\nArt, Books, Music.. we tend to credit those to the painter/author/musician. But not so much movies, animation, games, and other forms of content that arose in the 20th and 21st century. That's good for creators and companies. But maybe that's \"stealing\" a tiny sliver of the Mouse's cheddar, so here we are.\n\nIANAL.",

Video game companies (e.g Atari, I believe) did not originally credit anyone involved in the development. Hollywood didn't want to credit actors or directors originally. \n\nIn those cases part of the reason was that they didn't want their talent poached (i.e, they didn't want to have to pay their talent more money), but they also just didn't want to share credit.

The bottom line is Disney does own the IP known as Star Wars and by extension all entities within that IP (Star Destroyers, X-Wings, Jedi etc) and therefore the pictures the fans create of Star Destroyers and other 'star wars' ships are owned by Disney/Lucasfilm and so they are within their rights to claim those pictures, even if those pictures are original designs never before seen in Disney/LF media. Some fans go so far as to create elaborate backstories and histories for their creations. As far as I know, none of the fans who have had artwork stolen and used want money, they just want recognition, their name on the comic as an artist - which I 100% support.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://youtu.be/WmF8l96AeBM](https://youtu.be/WmF8l96AeBM)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERAM9qXKGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oERAM9qXKGc)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhAyTcsgiXs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhAyTcsgiXs)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgGr5p53tH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgGr5p53tH4)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SgPXXknm7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SgPXXknm7Y)",

Even though Disney could sue to fan-artists for copyright infringement, sent them C&amp;D letters to stop the distribution of the fan art, and so on - the fan artists still own their own artwork. They might not be able to show their artwork to anyone, but they still have the rights to it.\n\nIn other words, Disney DO NOT have the right to use fan art without getting permission from the artist. \n\nTechnically, the artist could sue Disney for copyright infringement and win. Obviously though, in reality this would just make Disney file a bigass counter-suit for the fan-artist infringing Disney's copyright when they made their fanart in the first place, and leave the fan-artist completely steamrolled - in other words, in reality going after Disney for this would be legal suicide, but still... I think it's an important distinction to make. Disney, or any other big IP holder, *do not* have a neither a legal nor a moral right to use fan art as they want.",

Aladdin and The Lion King came close but still couldn\u2019t compete with Batman and X-Men and Jurassic Park and Spider-Man if you were like 10 or 11 years old in the early 90s.\n\nBut they sure as fuck threw the money hat around and bought up a big chunk of the shit I love, from Planet of the Apes to X-Files to The Simpsons to Alien and Predator and Die Hard and obviously LucasFilm and Marvel.\n\nObviously none of that was created by Disney. They don\u2019t deserve the credit for the greatness but good luck circumventing Disney\u2019s ownership of any of that stuff if you want to enjoy it. Shit belongs to them whether you like it or not. \n\nMarvel in particular is an egregious example of this shit, and in Disney\u2019s defense, that predates the Disney acquisition by decades. Read up on Bill Mantlo, the co-creator of Rocket Raccoon. He was struck by a car in the early 90s and his brother has to beg for money for round-the-clock medical care for him via GoFundMe while Disney makes hundreds of millions of dollars off of Rocket Raccoon merch and movies and video games featuring the character. And they had the balls to go into his assisted living facility a few years ago to let him watch a DVD copy one of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies for free like they were doing him some huge favor, and it was publicized like it was a heartwarming story. \n\nSo this Alan Dean Foster shit comes as no surprise. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get what he\u2019s owed, but it seems like their policy is to screw people over until they raise a big stink, and it\u2019s doubtful that they will ever face any repercussions. Is a single parent going to cancel their Disney trip or even put that Olaf plush doll back on the shelf at Target because they fucked Alan Dean Foster over? Nope. And I\u2019m guilty of that too. If I were to boycott Disney+ because of this shit then I wouldn\u2019t be able to see Baby Yoda vomiting up green macaroons. That\u2019s a sacrifice I\u2019m not willing to make, admittedly.",

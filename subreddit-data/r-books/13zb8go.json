    "postText": "Just finished W.G. Sebald's \"The Rings of Saturn\" in a three-day reading stint (that's fast for me) and now I have what feels like post-nut clarity. \n\nWithout spoilers I felt like I was led by the hand into the perfectly ordered thoughts of a lonely man trying to tangle with the idea of how loneliness manifests in others, and how it affects memory. Not so much despair, mind you, but loneliness itself. \n\nI got this book suggestion from you, my friends at r/books. What did you think of it? I'm including the spoiler tag so please speak freely.",

            "comment": "It is one of my favourite books. I am from Suffolk though have not lived there for thirty years and I immediately recognised the sense of place. I always say Sebald is my favourite prose writer in the English language even though he did not write in English. It breaks my heart that we lost him two decades ago just as he was producing his best work.",

Saturn reminds me of Roberto Calasso the way it bounces around tangentially related topics in history while keeping a steady thread of destruction. However, I would be lying if I said I didn't prefer the more personal voice I have found in Vertigo and Emigrants.",

I had read VERTIGO by Sebald and while I enjoyed it in many ways, I felt like it was his effort to order some conflicting, mutually-influential feelings and ideas that he had to share, that were bursting from his head. \n\nSATURN was more ... orderly, structured, intentional. Less spontaneous and while personal, less \"about\" him as the thinker putting forth his ideas and insights.\n\nI loved RINGS OF SATURN and think about it often. And I've never been to Suffolk, Essex or Norfolk...but I truly feel like I have, thanks to Sebald.",

Once you come in, you can never leave.\n\nBy the way, I love your description of your post-nut clarity after reading this book. It felt, to me, like I had passed into a deep, fugue-like state and emerged from it without being aware of how, where, and when. Which is rather like the experience of how the souls of the dead pass out of this life and mirrors must be shrouded from them so that they can only gradually realize that they have left the world.",

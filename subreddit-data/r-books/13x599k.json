(I hate this in movies too.) There is nothing more yawn-inducing than a deliberate attempt to hook the reader with something \"thrilling\" right out of the gate. \n\nThe second thing that will make me close a book and never open it again is anything involving animals being harmed. If it is super integral to the story, I may forgive it, but more often than not, it's just another cheap ploy to illicit emotion in the reader.",

Thing is, they're considered to be some of the better Star Wars books ever written.\n\nNo accounting for taste, obviously, but I always found this gripe to be strange for two particular reasons; the first is that this book was published in 1991 when there were far fewer star wars tropes and devices that were accepted as part of the universe. The prequels hadn't even come out yet! All the authors had were the original three movies, their own imaginations and occasional insight from Lucasfilm. They had to make everything else up about the setting as they went along so naturally there were going to be some strange choices along the way.\n\nThe second is calling hot chocolate \"exotic\" in our world is obviously pretty strange but it wasn't always like that. Used to be a few hundred years ago chocolate was something grown in a place very few Europeans had ever been to and as such was a wildly expensive thing only the wealthy could ever hope to afford or even see (again, at least in Europe). Calling it \"exotic\" in that context isn't nearly as weird.\n\nNow, maybe it still doesn't make sense in a universe where you can land your spaceship anywhere, get your droid to load a box of cocoa in your cargo hold and engage your magic faster than light engine to take you across the galaxy in a few hours/days to sell it somewhere else but then again its also a universe where the greatest warriors still spin swords like its the 14th century because they're just space samurai/wizards so perhaps its not the strangest thing in a galaxy far far away.",

Shitty analogy, but not too far off, I hope.\n\nTo my dismay, there are plenty of books written in present tense that are quite successful, but I think I have seen far more written in past tense. The present tense seems to be a trend of certain niches or sub-genres, and to what I've seen, it's rather recent (less than 10 years, first time I personally saw it was with The Hunger Games, for example... I hated it right off). Maybe your friend reads a lot in a certain niche? Like, YA fiction? I'm just throwing a dumb guess here because I've seen present tense in an awful lot of YA books. Don't pay too much attention to this.\n\nThat being said, do what you feel. Study closely the works you enjoy and that you aspire to be like. Open a book for something more than reading it, examine the writing, practice, practice, practice. I'm not saying copy, imitate or plagiarize, but observe and practice as you develop your own voice.\n\nI've always felt like present tense and narrative fiction are some sort of incompatibility (narrator, you're telling me a story that has already happened -even more so if you keep throwing foreshadowing comments here and there, it's not developing right now as we speak, haha). Except when the present tense is used to certain effect in certain fragments of the story, to tell a complete story in present tense feels awkward to me, but it's all a personal observation. \n\nTL;DR: Keep writing and forget about that friend, especially if she sucks away your passion to write. Write for yourself. You're the first person that must be satisfied with the results. Keep it up and godspeed, darling!\n\nEDIT: typos. English isn't my first language.",

This may strike me as a sensible person but I hate when the author takes pleasure in torturing and abusing the characters physically, sexually and psychologically when that is not necessary for the plot, just to make the story grim and edgy. It was for this reason that I recently DNF *Gideon the Ninth*: the main character describes how she has tried to escape her abusive home since she was 4 years old and had already tried 86 times by the time she is 18 years old, and also describes how once as a punishment she was left without heating in her cell and it became so cold that her toes gangrened.

It had an interesting plot and conflict and some rising action... and then it got more plot and a second conflict, more rising action.. and then again some more plot and a third plot with very little rising action.. and then THEY DID IT A FOURTH TIME! They never resolved any of the conflicts and just kept piling on so I said, \"you know what? Fuck this.\"\n\nSomeone told me later that the book getting better but I just can't put myself through the building stress of never having a climax.\n\n\nThe other book was when I was a kid so I don't remember it clearly but I remember just being super confused. Started with a nice character, I was confused about the setting, started getting some answers and then it switch to what was basically a completely different world with completely different characters. I never got back to the first character or world but my cousin says it eventually all makes sense by the end of the second book. \n\nSo basically I stop reading books when they're confusing, too complicated, or too stressful, or just being dragged on way too long.",

No. \n\nDitto anything gross or offensive. I don't care yet, so hell to the no. \n\nWe meet MC as they're waking up? Nope, clich\u00e9. Ditto staring into a mirror. \n\nThere's a glaring typo on page one?? Haha. No. The rest will only be worse. \n\nOver-explainy and similarly clunky prose--NOPE. You published too early. \n\nPainful dialogue. Poor layout choices. All the tropes, none of the cleverness. The list goes on and on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I've been lured in, things that will make me DNF: \n\n\"Smart\" character(s) being egregiously stupid. Pick one, author. \n\nPoor use of non-male characters. \n\nAwful hero. (I read a lot of romance). \n\nThe second half of the book was obviously not given the editing the first half got--oh, do these get bad reviews. \n\nBad rep of real world human problems like assault trauma and mental illnesses and the like. Do your fucking research or suffer the reviewer-rage consequences. \n\nToken single non-white non-straight non-male character is killed to serve as lesson to hero. Hell to the nope, grow up, this was so last century and never okay. \n\nThere are more, but they're not coming to me right now. I may have scared them off. :)",

Usually once i have a book in my hands i try to give it a chance, like 100-200 pages and if I'm still really bored or if I have a more interesting book nearby I'll switch to read that instead. Sometimes I will read books I don't like though just to try to figure out why I don't like them. Essentially the worst crime a book can commit as far as I'm concerned, is lacking in imagination. Even history books are better when the writer is imaginative and has an interesting perspective",

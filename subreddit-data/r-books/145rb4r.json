    "postText": "I only started reading a little over 2 years ago and it's been one of the best things I've decided to pick up on a whim. I began my journey with A Game of Thrones, a decision that I would soon find to potentially be a mistake once I realized how complicated the series was. Perhaps not the most beginner friendly thing. But I was in love with the plot and the characters and the world, so over the course of a period of time I'm not comfortable sharing out of embarrassment, I eventually got through it. \n\nBooks 2 and 3 of the series went quicker and I found myself enjoying the books more and more, book 3 especially. I read all 3 of these books back to back so I decided to take a break from the series there to explore what other books had to offer. I read Project Hail Mary and Six of Crows, and both were a very fun experience.\n\nWhen I returned to the series I noticed something though. I found it much more difficult to get through book 4 than any of the others, for reasons I was not able to place then. I thought I had just soiled my reading comprehension ability by reading two other easier books and now I couldn't read this. Still, I trudged through it. \n\nI took another break there to read Crooked Kingdom and now I'm back to book 5, A Dance with Dragons. And it's been a nightmare. It's been months and I'm not even 300 pages in cause its so hard to find motivation to pick it up. I'm noticing specific things about the writing that I absolutely hate. Chapters take way too long to get to the point and sometimes there is no point. Like I just read a Davos chapter where LITERALLY nothing noteworthy happened. And I'm just sick of it man, I've honestly considered dropping the book but I'm so close to the conclusion (for now) of this series. I really don't know what to do, every reading session feels like wading through molasses. I can only read a chapter or 2 at a time and have to take frequent breaks to check my phone or to just sit and contemplate for a bit why I'm still even reading this.\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for solutions or suggestions although you're certainly welcome to share any. I just wanted to vent about this and to see if other people have similar opinions. I've heard that books 4 and 5 are where the series fell off so maybe I'm not crazy. But there's always a voice in the back of my mind telling me that the only reason it's such a slog is because I'm not smart enough to handle all the little complexities of the book. Idk man",

I have hooked dozens of people on the books and the TV series, pre-last season fiasco. I was a huge fan, one of those assholes who had at least one hourlong debate session a week that RT+LS=JS, and that was after reading the first book in the series.\n\nI have completely lost interest in the series now. Don't care; won't buy it. Won't give money to someone who talks shit about his fans, the people who made him his money and his fame, to the extent that he does.\n\nIn my own head canon, the Nights Watch discovers a strange hatch in the end of book five. It reads USAF NORAD. Book six would have been all about them trying to open the hatch, ending with a fucking time travel BS plotline that resolves in Arya having been dreaming the whole time.

Forcing yourself into finishing a book will make you hate it....so maybe be a little kinder to yourself, recognize you have different needs at different times, and read what seems interesting.  If you're struggling, stop, put it down, maybe pick it up again if you want to, it's not a race and as the point of reading a novel is to enjoy it, if the novel does not fulfill that role, don't bother.  As a point, I love dickens movies, it is only in later life that I am starting to enjoy the novels, before that he seemed to go on and on, I mean a page describing the opening of a door !",

I think it\u2019s just that you took a break from the series and Feast for Crows is hard to get through even if you read them back to back. I had a hard time getting through that book for many reasons. One of them was that the story is broken up into two pieces, so until you finish Dance of Dragons, you\u2019ll never know what\u2019s going on in that world as a whole. It\u2019s definitely worth fighting through it but it\u2019s a slog. And Dance of Dragons is disappointing because we have major cliffhangers( that we\u2019re never going to get the conclusion!) So just stick with it. It seems a shame not to finish since it sounds like you\u2019re close enough to then of Dance.",

It never occurred to me that it might be simply that they haven\u2019t had that long an experience reading. And this might be one of a few - if not their 1st experience. \n\nI\u2019d say keep at it - reading that is. You don\u2019t HAVE to suffer your way through writing you don\u2019t appreciate or that may be too complex for you at a given time. But more experience reading may help you to appreciate the slower parts, the character inner life and monologue etc. It\u2019s something that has been a staple in literature for centuries.",

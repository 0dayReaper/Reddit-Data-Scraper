    "postText": "I read and reread The Prince a couple times and figured everything he wrote there was just the average politics during the Spring Autumn and Warring States period. During the Three Kingdoms period, the fallen kings of the three dynasties that ruled each kingdom also worked hard to keep their families from not being massacred (Machiavelli advocated killing the previous ruling family in order to not be avenged). In my country, for example, the Ly and Tran dynasty also practiced everything Machiavelli wrote in the book.",

            "comment": "There are various ways to interpret The Prince, some would say the whole opus is intended to satirise and villify the prince of a state under the guise of potentially enticing the then ruler of Florence to demand his services. It\u2019s easy to interpret a cynical attitude towards ruling, where its practices are almost childlike in their ruthlessness, with an almost Lord of the flies-like barbarous brutality, which is quite far from the renaissance conception of an ideal state.\n\nMachiavelli was also very interested in history and its ebbs and flows in the changing of rulers aswell as what constitutes a beneficial stability and what causes turmoil. I do think that trying to understand the person of the author and his situation could in this case be elucidating to get some perspective on how one might interpret Il Principe.",

                    "comment": "Well, some people think Machiavelli had a depressing attitude towards politics, I wouldn't say that, seeing how effective the same things as his ideas were carried out in China and my country. However, I do think he came out late, which is why he was criticized. Otherwise people would treat him as a politician of his time. His ideas were pretty much 500 BC (the time of the Spring Autumn period), while the West was starting to advocate a humane state as the Renaissance was expanding its sphere of influence and deepening its impact.\n\nI do understand the *maybe* of why Machiavelli came up with the ideas mentioned in the Prince. He did not try to invent new methods of leadership, rather he was trying to analyze the old ways of ruling. The Renaissance in general was a movement which aimed to revise and revive the past, particularly the Roman era. The Roman Empire (or Rome, Roman Republic, ancient Greece) was seen by European thinkers as a model society. People were hopeful to improve Europe, as they have only escaped from the Middle Ages. So, in my perception, Machiavelli was attempting to revise the historical ways of ruling in which he deemed effective.\n\nBut Machiavelli's ideas were too outdated and went straight against the path most other Renaissance thinkers aimed for. While the others were constructing and adopting the ideas of Humanism, Machiavelli was stuck in the cruel ways of the past and the past itself to the point of being reactionary. Nowadays, there are also a number of people who think old ways of ruling were better compared to American politicians competing for votes, militaries staging coups to surface-level democracies, etc. Their ideas are often called \"authoritarianism\" by Western media, and shunned upon.\n\nWhile Humanism was creating strong influences in Western politics, even in the 18th century, the East were pretty much still submerging into Middle Ages morals and actions. In Vietnam, the schism of the Trinh and Nguyen houses, in spite of all the technological development and nationalist calls, the lords were still trying to murder entire families of their opponent, witchhunting, etc. Civilian artists and musicians were considered lowlife-\"s\u01b0\u1edbng ca v\u00f4 lo\u00e0i\"-\"people who sing are of no civilized class.\" So, if Machiavelli somehow was born in the East instead of the West, he would probably be approved.",

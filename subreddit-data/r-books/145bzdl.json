    "postText": "EDIT: This edit is late since most people who were going to comment already have, but I should probably define \"speed-reading\" in this context. The idea is to take in chunks of words by looking at them without reading them one-by-one. For example, if it says \"the assassination of John F. Kennedy,\" you would learn to take one look at that whole group of words and understand what it means. Reading each word quietly or in your head (aka subvocalizing), even at fast rate, is not considered \"speed reading\" in this context.\n\nThis might be the wrong sub for this post, so I apologize.\n\nI took a course on speed reading and read Evelyn Wood's *Reading Dynamics*. I understand the idea, but I'm not entirely convinced.\n\nTo a certain extent, the concept of speed reading is great. You can read faster by stopping subvocalizing and doing practicing drills.\n\nI think there is a limit though. I don't know if it's 500 words per minute, 600 words, or maybe 700, YMMV. People who claim to read over 1,000 words per minute are probably skimming at best.\n\nAnd sometimes, skimming is necessary. An attorney with 12,000 pages of evidence to go through (most of which are probably redundant) doesn't have time to read everything. Some people need to skim.\n\nWhen speed-reading courses claim to teach you how to read at upwards of 1,000 words per minute, I think all they're teaching you is how to skim.\n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n\nYou go through \"Thank You, Ma'am\" by Langston Hughes in 30 seconds. All you understand is that a boy named Roger tries to steal a woman's purse to get money so that he can buy suede shoes, the woman takes him home to feed him, and the boy leaves in the end.\n\nThat is a good summary, but if that's all you got out of the story, you didn't \"read\" it.\n\nWhen/where did the boy try to steal the woman's purse? Why was he unsuccessful in stealing it? Did the woman say what she would have done if Roger were her son? What did she notice about Roger's face? What did she do about it? Someone who READ the story can answer these questions. If you go through the story and can't answer most of them, you probably didn't read it.\n\nI support learning speed reading. It's an important skill for more people to learn. Skimming is also valuable. My only concern is not to confuse \"skimming\" with \"reading\".\"",

I read the same way (EDIT: it differs slightly between fact/fiction), but moderate my reading pace depending on various variables (language, complexity of subject, difficulty of text, fact/fiction, tiredness, surrounding noise, etc).\n\nPeople who \u201cspeed read\u201d do you consciously say to yourself \u201cnow I will speed read this text\u201d and consciously use a different technique? This is very odd to me.\n\nI never understood people throwing numbers of pages, words per minute around because it varies so much. Does it not vary for everyone? In a given week I will probably read a wonderful mix of pulp trash, literary fiction, comics and scientific journal articles, probably with some SF and fantasy thrown in. Likely in at least two different languages. All at different speeds, because the texts will vary and I myself will vary in mood and mental capacity.",

I\u2019ll also not read torture scenes in any great detail as how someone is tortured doesn\u2019t really add to the story for  me . Overly long flowery descriptions of a place bore me - when the author tries to showcase writing skills . I\u2019ll skim over to make sure no words that seem out of place . Sometimes I will miss things as the story line will hop - if that happens I just go back and find what I miss .",

It would have been a game changer academically. I mean, I always loved reading, but I didn't realize how reading at an average pace gave my mind too much room to wander and how reading a biology text like a novel was a bad idea.\n\nWith speedreading non-fiction the emphasis was on seeing how the information was structured, so a bit of pre-reading. This helped me hugely in graduate school. The other emphasis was on to read too fast to subvocalize but to replace one's sub vocalization with a real-time summary and reaction called overt comprehension.\n\nWith reading fiction the emphasis was on visualization. I tend to \"cast\" novels and sometimes even look up paintings and such to help me with the mind-pictures.\n\nFinally, check comprehension with out-loud, full-sentence summaries called tellbacks. This again was hugely important. I only do this with text I am studying but my husband and I are avid readers so we take turns discussing what we are reading. If you don't talk about what you read recall will be poor.",

    "postText": "Was curious what most book readers peffer to d\u03bf and why. How do u save book quotes and if u chose to not write on a book, why not? \n\nFor me, most of the times I do underline things that make me think about something in a new interesting way I haven't before, or quotes that i can really relate to. Some of my books are full of underlying, some have minimal, but I almost always do this, so that If i chose to go back in a book to remember something, i can easily find it. I dont use kindle, since I don't prefer e-books. But from things I've heard, It must be very usefull as well.",

But over time, what I get out of a book changes, and now I have books where 10+ years ago I underlined stuff and for the life me of have no idea why. Most likely just because either the info is so integrated in my life that it seems silly to have underlined it, or my perspective has shifted significantly and now that thing isn't important to me anymore, so having it underlined is a major distraction in the book then.   \nSo now I use just scraps of paper or post it notes to mark stuff in books. Then when I finish the book, I keep a spreadsheet of quotes I love and I put anything applicable in that spreadsheet for easy reference later.",

And i guess this way makes it even more unique. I also like the idea of me re-reading a book which made me feel things, and coming across quotes that pulled my intention in yhe past. Like getting in touch with your past self, kind of. I also love seing what other people underline. It's like u take a look on their mind as well, and i think this is very beautiful. In no way i can think of it like \"destroying\" a book. I can understand however that generally, if u want to sell them for example their price can be lowered. Like they have to look like unused, undread. But for me this doesnt matter.",

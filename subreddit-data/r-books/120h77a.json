And while that is true, and better dealt with in shows like Star Trek than in my reddit rants, it too has limits. I don't need any sort of cultural history to know that some things are universally true. For example, genocide isn't something to tolerate, even if your culture thinks it is tradition. \n\nBut your way of saying this is succinct and understandable and much better than my trollibn or even star trek's hypothetical analyses.\n\nDo you have a similar one for the idea that we should not be able to hold a vote to abolish democracy.",

Not in school, not in business, not on social media. The fact people are doubling down and making their own biomes to culture intolerance is frightening, especially since it's getting funded by the uber wealthy that actually want to keep it going for the sake of themselves.  They do it all by getting your neighbor to attack your neighbor, even though your employer and elected representatives are the reason you are unhappy. It's how the civil war began.\n\nAsk any US republican, what happened to gas prices and inflation? The only thing we have heard about since the mid terms is \"woke\" and \"trans\", even though the haven't shut up about the former for 3 years.",

Anyone can pretty easily get their hands on any book and publishers are free to distribute almost anything.\n\nWhen you see articles about \"banning\" a book, it often really refers to either a) removing that book from the curriculum in a public school, or b) removing it from circulation at a public (and/or public school) library. In other words, not really a ban.\n\nA lot of the First Amendment analysis provided in response to your question is very wrong, by the way. A teacher/school/school board may opt not to teach a book, or keep it in a school library, and that is not considered a First Amendment violation. However, actually removing a book from library shelves based on content COULD be unconstitutional. So might confiscating a book from a student be. In US public schools, the First Amendment is weaker than it is in the general public, under the reasoning that there is a certain interest in maintaining order and appropriateness in the school setting. There is also a different standard in public schools and private schools.\n\nThis has all been VERY ELI5 and abbreviated. There is a long history of First Amendment jurisprudence that pertains specifically to the school setting, so if you are genuinely interested in researching it you will find a wealth of reading.\n\nThe shortest answer to your question is: it really depends on the book, the exact \"ban\" implemented, and all the circumstances surrounding it.",

            "comment": "Full text of article:\n\n&gt; SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WGEM) - The Illinois House passed a bill Wednesday that would prohibit libraries from banning books or other material because of partisan or doctrinal pressure, prompting strong opposition from Republicans who called it an assault on local control.\n\n&gt; House Bill 2789 is an initiative of Democratic Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, whose office oversees the Illinois State Library and administers several grant programs for public and school libraries as well as adult literacy programs throughout the state.\n\n&gt; The bill would require that as a condition of qualifying for those grants in the future, libraries or library systems would have to adopt a written policy prohibiting the practice of banning books. Alternatively, they could adopt the American Library Association\u2019s Library Bill of Rights, which includes a statement that \u201c(m)aterials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bill came in response to a wave of high-profile controversies throughout the country, including at least one in Illinois. School districts and public libraries have come under pressure to remove certain material from their collections, often material dealing with issues involving race, sexuality and gender identity.\n\n&gt; \u201cBanning books is the sort of behavior that was once, for good reason, associated with the worst, most repressive and repugnant authoritarian regimes of the mid-20th century and before,\u201d the bill\u2019s lead sponsor Rep. Anne Stava-Murray, D-Naperville, said during debate on the House floor. \u201cThe fact that this is even up for discussion in America in the 21st century is disgusting. And yet, just last year in my district, that discussion was spurred on by a few radical parents and the Proud Boys hate group over a book called \u2018Gender Queer.\u2019\u201d\n\n&gt; That book is a memoir by Maia Kobabe about a nonbinary person grappling with issues of gender identity and sexuality as a teenager and young adult. According to the New York Times, it has been pulled from library shelves in dozens of school districts around the country.\n\n&gt; One of the school districts that came under pressure to remove the book was Community High School District 99, in Downers Grove, in Stava-Murray\u2019s district. According to a June 2022 Chicago Sun-Times story, the pressure was generated by a group of conservative parents and members of the Proud Boys, but students in the district pushed back and the board eventually voted unanimously to keep the book on the shelves.\n\n&gt; \u201cStudents led a community-supported effort in my district to keep the book in the library,\u201d Stava-Murray said. \u201cBut kids shouldn\u2019t have to be the heroes\u2026 Nobody is forcing you or your children to check out or purchase or read these books. If they are not consistent with your personal beliefs, don\u2019t read them.\u201d\n\n&gt; PEN American, in a report on book bans around the country, identified five enforced bans in the state between July 2021 and June 2022, including 3 bans of Gender Queer.\n\n&gt; Some Republicans, however, argued that public libraries are governed by locally elected boards, and that those boards should have the authority to decide how best to serve their communities.\n\n&gt; \u201cI find this a complete assault on local control,\u201d said Rep. Martin McLaughlin, R-Barrington Hills. \u201c\u2026 These people volunteer as nonpartisan elected local officials, and for the state to tell a local library board, \u2018listen to the professionals; follow the professionals\u2019 \u2013 I don\u2019t understand why we have local elections anymore if a bill like this passes.\u201d\n\n&gt; Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Jacksonville, said that he used to serve on his local library board and when his own children visit the library, they are accompanied by a parent. But he said that is not necessarily the case when they are at school using the school library.\n\n&gt; \u201cI am not for banning books at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI am for age-appropriate materials. And so, if a parent wants their kid to have those age-appropriate materials, they can certainly get them for them. I don\u2019t think that a librarian is the end-all, be-all decision maker in the state of Illinois on what books should be given to a child.\u201d\n\n&gt; Stava-Murray, however, rejected those arguments, saying the bill would only add another condition onto the rules to qualify for grants administered by the secretary of state. Last year, the office awarded more than 1,600 grants totaling more than $62 million, including a $4,300 grant to Downers Grove Community High School District 99.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn terms of the argument about local control, I find that disgusting. Local Control has long been a dog whistle for allowing statewide or nationwide racist or bigoted policies to persist,\u201d she said, eliciting loud boos from the Republican side of the aisle. \u201cToday, I just strongly urge my colleagues to do the right thing and make sure that access to books is not infringed upon in our state.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bill passed the House 69-39 with all of the no votes coming from Republicans. Three Democrats and one Republican were recorded as present but not voting. The bill next goes to the Senate for consideration.\n\n&gt; \u201cPublic and school libraries are facing unprecedented censorship of books and resources, not just in Illinois but throughout the nation,\u201d Giannoulias said in a statement after the vote. \u201cThis important first-in-the-nation legislation combats book banning and upholds freedom of speech, which America has always stood for. I applaud the Illinois House of Representatives for passing this important measure and encourage the State Senate to do the same.\u201d",

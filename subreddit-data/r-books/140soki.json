    "postText": "In The Dark Tower by Steven King Roland Deschain had to go to the dark tower again and again. When he reached the tower he went upstairs and found a door where his name was written. He opened this door and, after opening, Roland ended up in a desert - in the beginning. It was his curse. Who do you think cursed him?\nP. S. Please answer only if you have read all 7 books.",

The Gunslinger\u2019s curse is to watch his friends die over and over again while he chases something that can\u2019t be caught.",

In the cycle that the books described, Roland doesn't have Cuthbert's horn, so is unable to sound it at the foot of the Dark Tower like he promised. In the next cycle at the end of book 7, he now has the horn with him.\n\nAnd if we consider the awful movie to be canon (which seems to be King's intention) and depicting the final cycle, we see Roland saving Jake instead of letting him die.",

So in each cycle he sheds some of those sins, until he reaches a final nirvana cycle where he is at last deemed worthy to rescue the Dark Tower.",

The actual mechanisms the tower uses aren't defined. \n\nTime travel of a sort is certainly possible as a few people in the DT universe have been seemingly displaced in time, notably Jake who suffered the paradoxical effects of his timeline being altered. \n\nBut it's never clear if they've *actually* time traveled, been moved to alternate dimensions, been reincarnated or moved into different dimensions/realities as Father Callhan seemed to be, are MCU style variants (that time travel only establishes alternate timelines is revealed in 11/22/63), or are experiencing some other effect of the Tower. \n\nWhether Roland is cursed or blessed is a philosophical question with no real answer.",

But there was no multi universe revolving around Jake like multi universe did around Roland. If Roland exactly traveled in time, then Steven King, Crimson King, Man in black and other characters did it too. So it's not clear if it is real what happened in that dimension...",

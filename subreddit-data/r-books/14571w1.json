I liked a few others in that series but many were odd so i kinda left him behind...\n\nA year or two ago I started browsing his works. I found many series to be remarkable. Innovative and thought provoking. \n\nHe also did great character work-  leading me to read several novels who's synopsis made me think I'd despise them...\n\nBut then I heard the news.. and read the quotes\n\nAnd I couldn't enjoy any new series by Card. \n\nI still own several series and I may re read them but I dunno if it'll ever be the same.",

We are simply to interwoven with one another.   If I don\u2019t read an author because of their stance of issue A for example but unbeknownst to me the owner of the gas station I frequent gives thousands of dollars a year to that same cause. What was the sum of my efforts? Does my ignorance of his stance make his donations less harmful? So I said all that to say that you can take a stand at that would be very noble of you but I don\u2019t think it will make much of a difference and that that\u2019s ok.",

We don't toss out the declaration of independence because slave owners wrote it. We don't toss out scientific breakthroughs because the originated from someone with regressive or offensive views. \n\nI'll probably read more Card. But only used books or library borrows. I can't bring myself to give him any money.\n\nSame for the Potter books.. except that bitch had the decency to not do anything good after that original series. I know she didn't write the latest movies.. but I still blame her for the shit quality of those",

First, because most artists create their art using their personal beliefs, experiences, and desires. The Artist is very much IN their art. Second, they typically earn a living from our enjoyment of their art, which we can typically assume some of that money will be going to support their personal beliefs, even if indirectly. \n\n\nTo me, it's more a balancing act between how much you dislike/disapprove of their personal beliefs (or how incompatible they are with yours), and how much you enjoy their art. \n\nDo you enjoy the \"Ender\" series enough to accept that at least some of the money you've spent on the books (or the film) will be going to support his anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+ views?",

We give people the benefit of the doubt till we encounter enough credible information that negates that doubt. \n\n\n&gt; You like what you like. \n\nThat was never in question. The question is, do you like it enough to ignore a person's beliefs or actions, if you happen to be in conflict with those beliefs or actions. \n\n&gt;  A lot of people like All Summer Long but don't subscribe to Kid Rock's politics.\n\nSo, they need to decide if their enjoyment of the song is greater than their dislike of Kid Rock's politics/beliefs. They can't separate the two. \n\nJoss Whedon is one for me. I've enjoyed so much of his work, both TV and film. I find it a little more difficult to enjoy it now, given what we know of his actions and attitudes on set with his cast. The problem then becomes about the cast, many of who were the victims of Joss' attitudes on set, and appear to have beliefs and positions more compatible with mine.  How do I balance their contributions, their actions, their personal beliefs, etc., against his?",

The art and the artist can't be separated, because the art is created by and from the artist's beliefs and experiences. \n\nBoth Da Vinci and Michelangelo were both amazing, accomplished painters, but Da Vinci wouldn't have painted the Sistine Chapel like Michelangelo, nor would Michelangelo have painted the Mona Lisa like Da Vinci. \n\nThe Rolling Stones wouldn't have created \"Hey Jude\" any more than the Beatles would've created \"Paint It Black\". \n\nThey all had different lives, different experiences, and different beliefs, all of which formed their particular styles, and those styles are what created the works of art they're known for. \n\nChange the person, and you change their experiences. Change their experiences and you change how they developed their styles. Change their styles and you change their art. \n\nWhat you're doing is determining how much of their behaviour, how much of their personal beliefs, how much of their actions, you are willing to tolerate in order to enjoy the works they created.",

They want to hold the moral \"high ground\" but be inconvenienced by it.  \n\nAll I'm suggesting is that we look at this \"separate the art from the artist\" in a different, and in my opinion, more honest way, because here's the thing, these artists who's political views, religious views, or behaviour, you find disagreeable, don't care about whether you agree with their position when they take your money and use it to support those things you disagree with. \n\nYou may disagree with the \"Church\" of Scientology, but Tom Cruise isn't going to care as the money he made from your ticket sale or DVD purchase of the last Mission Impossible film gets \"donated\" tot hem. \n\nAt some point, you need to understand and accept that your choices, particularly when money is involved, does have an impact.",

I liked the book long before I knew about OSC and will continue to like it.\n\nI also think OSC may have had a different mind set when EG was written. I think many only took these kind of stances in this era of super-charged partisan politics.  I'm not using this as a cop out, but the themes of EG don't feel consistent with OSC's current opinions. I could be very wrong.",

You can suppress your personal beliefs a bit, but everything from how you define words to how you view people is based on personal perspective that is defined by your beliefs.\n\nThink about this as an example. If you're raised catholic, your concept of religion is based on that experience. Everything from what a God is to what religion looks like is based on that. Even if you then reject catholicism, your world view remains based on that lived experience of being catholic. Any experiences counter to that remain based on that previous understanding. You have to relearn concepts in order to change those baseline assumptions (IE: God is omniscient, religious buildings are architecturally huge, religion is organized, ect).\n\nIt's why varied representation in authorship is important. Because people with different lived experiences genuinely *think differently* and express ideas differently.",

It's easy to say \"just separate the art from the artist,\" but that can be difficult in practice, especially if the knowledge that they're a jerk is new to you.\n\nWith Card in particular it's even more difficult because his views very obviously leak into his later work in a way that feels awkward to read.  One of his later Enderverse books has a strong antiabortion theme that I kept getting distracted by, because it didn't really fit with how I had read the characters.  He has a time travel book about Christopher Columbus that felt awkward in places knowing he's conservative, where I don't want to attribute certain choices he made in that book to his views but it was hard not to.  Worst of all was the modern-setting book where a thinly veiled George Soros analogue funds evil leftist militants to take over the US government on the basis that the 2000 election was stolen from Gore (boy this feels ironic now), while our good old salt of the earth small town veteran heroes, stymied on all sides by liberal betrayers, just have to get the word out to Bill O'Reilly so that Fox News can tell everyone the Real Truth about what's going on.  Just to be clear, that's the actual Bill O'Reilly and Fox News, not a thinly-veiled analogue like the Soros character.  Jesus Christ.\n\nIt's ok, you know?  You don't have to keep reading Card's work if you think you won't enjoy it anymore.  Ender's Game is still one of my favorite books, but after all the above I stopped reading any of his newer stuff for more or less the same reason.  There's more out there to read than we could read in a hundred lifetimes.  Read what you think you'll enjoy, maybe try things a little outside your comfort zone to make the zone of things you'll enjoy a little larger, but ultimately there's no moral imperative to keep reading the work of someone you think is a jerk.",

It makes them feel strong, or it gains them the approval of their tribe, or it's just a way to say that however much their life sucks at least they're not that other.  \n\nUnderstand that way to approach them is not by telling them how horrible they are or by telling your tribe how horrible they are. That's just serving your ego. Try asking why they believe that. Try actually listening to the response then asking more questions and pointing out where their story is hurting people. Try suggesting an alternate story that still fits in their worldview.\n\nDon't demand that they change, just make it clear that there are other options, even though those options might be hard. You might think they'd know that but most of us live in bubbles now and we actively avoid the other options.  Leaving the tribe is scary, which is why we often go along even if means doing things we know are wrong.  \n\nEvil isn't done by evil people, it's done by perfectly normal people who were going along with a bad idea.",

You can't really excuse people who are alive and actively try to abolish human rights (or some of them, or for certain groups of people) by just saying they're too dumb to know what they're doing, the social  contract of tue tribe doesn't allow that behavior because it's damaging (that's why the paradox of intolerance isn't a paradox).\n\nOSC isn't some neighbor or a reachable celeb we can directly show compassion to by reading his books. Sure don't attack him on Twitter and don't send him anything worse than a glitter bomb. If he goes through something heartbreaking or scary, don't be a jerk about it. But his books literally say women are almost always inferior and are made for baby making, he literally doesn't think at least half of the population is actual full human beings.",

I do consider that the media and the purposeful political polarization distort issues and lead to this but it seems that many celebrities do not think about this when they decide to give their opinion regarding a person or issue. I would prefer for artists/celebrities to stay out of it or as I heard it put years ago, shut up and dribble, but I also respect that everyone is free to state their opinion.",

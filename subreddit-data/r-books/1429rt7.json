    "postText": "Hi guys,\r  \n\r  \nI've read this short story - TV People, I mean - and have no idea what it is about. What's the meaning of the story? metaphor? anything?\r  \n\r  \nI've come up to this feeling quite sometimes when reading Murakami's short stories, and TV People is just one of them. I can not figure out what he wants to deliver, what the story is all about. I can agree with the point that we do not have to understand every single story we're told, but forgive me, at least reader should feel satisfied after reading, right? That's the thing which I can't get with many Murakami's short story.\r  \n\r  \nHe is a good writer, no doubt. He has his own unique style. But is it the reason that every short story of him must be an artwork? Maybe it's just a failure in many successes. Not all the story he wrote is art, I supposed. By the way, I just focus on his short stories at the time.\r  \n\r  \nBack to the main question: Anyone can explain to me the meaning or some kind of metaphor Murakami put in short story TV People, please? 'Cause i'm being kinda annoyed that I've read a long short story and it doesn't mean anything? (or I'm just so numb to figure it out).\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: What is the meaning of short story TV People?",

            "comment": "I can relate very well with you. Most of Murakami's short stories, and even the bigger works (at least partially) leave you hanging. I have read TV People too, but couldn't make too much out of it. I tried to figure it out, and I stumbled upon this [page](http://sittingbee.com/tv-people-haruki-murakami/). This page gives an acceptable idea about what could be going on.\n\nBtw, what other stuff of Murakami have you read? I have read almost all of his short stories and 4 novels. Loved most of those!",

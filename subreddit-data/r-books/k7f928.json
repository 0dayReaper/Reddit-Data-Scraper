You could then make \"Steamboat Willie\" cartoons with anyone you want and it's legal, but technically the character Mickey Mouse would still be copyrighted.\n\n(Note, we already have some precedent for that being how the law works of \"the cartoon specificially is public domain, but not the character. One of the infamous \"Censored Eleven\" Warner Bros. cartoons that they let leave copyright since those cartoons just had...well, ALL the racism was a Bugs Bunny cartoon, so technically THAT Bugs Bunny cartoon is public domain- but Bugs Bunny, the character, is not public domain- just that one cartoon (and since the cartoon in question was effectively Bugs's first appearance, only basically making Elmer Fudd black, it'd be hard to really use that cartoon for public domain without tripping over copyrighted Warner Bros. cartoons.)",

Disney did actually manage to get the government to pass a one-time renewal/extension of copyright on works from the early-mid 20th century, but it was a one time thing.\n\nIt doesn't mean people can just use modern Mickey though.  Disney can (and are planning to) prevent anybody from using his likeness in commerce using trademark law, because Mickey Mouse is a registered trademark and the mascot of the Walt Disney Company. A trademark never expires as long as the trademark is continuously used by the company, so the modern Mickey never enters the public domain until Disney stops putting his face all over their merch and parks. \n\nSteamboat Willy the work itself is entering the public domain, and because Steamboat Willy is significantly different from modern Mickey Mouse AND Disney doesn't actively use the character as a representative image of the brand, he will enter the public domain.",

He wasnt rich enough to marry until he ironically sold that novel.\n\nWhich highlights what The Great Gatsby is actually about. It's about a man who literally turns drug dealer to finally achieve the riches necessary to he considered by his long lost love, and how this so called high society is so  sociopathic, callous and culturally Insular that they view class not only through the lens of bank account size but who is \"cut from the right cloth\". That the wealthy would go on hurting people and ever think twice about who they hurt to get what they want. Social climbers like Gatsby are nuisances and can be dealt with criminally. The American dream is Inherently a lie because of the cultural beliefs of wealthy who you want to accept you",

Nick\u2019s probably in the closet and fighting his actual gay identity.\n\nThe memory also may be vague because he was a lightweight. Most of the book is described in intimate detail by Nick, and then that part essentially just conveniently skips hours and hours of time.\n\nNot to mention the dialogue when they were on the actual elevator. Emphasis mine:\n\n\"Come to lunch some day,\" he suggested, as we *groaned* down in the\nelevator.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.\"\n\n\"*Keep your hands off the lever*,\" snapped the elevator boy.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"*I didn't know I was\ntouching it.*\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"\n\n. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the\nsheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . .\nBrook'n Bridge . . . .\"\n\nThen I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania\nStation, staring at the morning \"Tribune\" and waiting for the four\no'clock train.\u201c",

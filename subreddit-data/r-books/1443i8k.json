    "postText": "For the best lazy reading weekend, I would find a comfy spot in my home maybe a chair or part of my bed, while my gf is peacefully sleeping.  I'd love to hear a thunderstorm outside, providing the only sound in the background, making the atmosphere calm and peaceful  no music (not even classical music)  just the rumble of the storm. I would make the room nice and cold, just how I like it. Near me, I would have some easy snacks (Sushi or Oreo) and a cool glass of Lipton iced tea. The book I would be eagerly diving into would be a suspenseful Stephen King novel a real page turner that would keep me engrossed (Or Brandon Sanderson, Tom Clancy). I would make sure I have a lot of free time with no tasks to do, so I can really get lost in the world of my book. I'd be wearing my most comfy clothes like pajamas. To keep my focus on the book, I would put away all distractions like my iPad, smartphone, TV, PS5, and even cable TV channels like HBO or National Geographic . With the cold room and the mesmerizing sound of the thunderstorm outside, I'd be all set for a perfect weekend of reading.\n\nExplain your perfect conditions for a lazy weekend of reading.",

Read a set amount (chapter, 10 pages, or even single page if it's that bad) and move to the next seating area. I try to make it through all the way to darling harbour, across Pyrmont Bridge, and through around the water to circular quay. I never make it before dark, but i do usually make enough progress to be unstuck.  \n\nI like to grab some snack or drink I've never had before from the nearby iga which does a LOT of foreign imports. \n\nI just really like to feel like I'm with people without having to actually be with people.

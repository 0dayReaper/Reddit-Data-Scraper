On the other hand, a lot of the writing is cringy and snobbish.\n\nFor me, it's like *yes, this book is clever. But dear God you are way too proud of how clever it is, and you want to hit your readers over the head with how clever you are.*\n\nIdk if I'm alone in this thinking, but I'm having a hard time finishing the book due to the author's occasionally insufferable nature.",

All of the architecture, the art, the secret rituals, the history, all of that is true, the Gnostic gospels. All of that is \u2026 all that is fiction, of course, is that there's a Harvard symbologist named Robert Langdon, and all of his actions is fictionalized. But the background is all true. \"\n\nThe background isn't all true. It's not even half true. Dan Brown tries to market it as such, but it doesn't take long to find out how inaccurate a lot of the background content is.",

The prose was nigh onto bullet points in a Powerpoint presentation, and every \\[very brief\\] chapter ended with an interrogatory to pull you into the next.  It made for breezy reading and marked the rise of the quintessential airport novel.  The kind you could pick up and drop at a moment, and resume later without worrying about immersion.",

He then realized it would make a whole lot more money if he pretended it was all true - to the extent that, when asked in interviews, he brazenly lied that it was all historically accurate. This doesn\u2019t affect the work of fiction in itself, but it clearly impacted its popularity for the better as people thought they were discovering some great am historical secret, not only reading a shortish novel of pulp fiction.",

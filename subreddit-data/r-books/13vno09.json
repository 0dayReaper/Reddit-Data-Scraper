Other books I can't remember what it is about and have to go through reviews to try and get a semblance of its contents.. Sometimes I feel like I should go back and re-read some books but the books I want to read next guilt me from doing so - I don't know how to strike that balance. Curious what everyone else does.",

All the way to the right click on 'edit'. The review box should pop up. At the bottom of the box look for 'Private notes, shown only to you'. If you don't see it, there should be 'more details' at the bottom. Click on that and the private notes box should appear. \n\nType your notes and click 'post'. Nothing will be publicly shown except your star rating and your review, if you wrote one. \n\nTo see your private notes, click on 'view' in the right column of the book you want in 'My Books'. They should be visible to you next to your profile picture. Hope this helps!\n\nEdit: I haven't used the app, so I'm not sure if the procedure is different, but I would assume you can also do this in the app.",

            "comment": "I have an annual text document where I track the month in which I read the book, the title, the author or editor, the translator if applicable, and what I rated it out of five.  It\u2019s important to me to be able to look back at what I was reading and when - it\u2019s almost like a diary, in some ways.  There\u2019s when I had that hyperfixation on medieval philosophy, that\u2019s when I was learning more about X after my diagnosis, here\u2019s when I was really sick and re-reading old favorites\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve thought about using something like Goodreads or Storygraph but haven\u2019t made the plunge yet.  It would be nice to get recommendations on what I should read based on what I\u2019ve enjoyed in the past, which I understand is a feature of both sites, but I don\u2019t know how accurate it is.",

I even remember books I read in the 4th grade that I really really liked, so I go based on what I can remember about it. If I can't remember much, it sits on my to read pile but more towards the bottom\n\nThis also makes it hard for me to reread books unless I fell in love with it",

Heaps of flexibility w the depth you decide to go into, simple list or detailed chapter notes for example. \nThat being said I don\u2019t take notes for everything I read (mostly just for the books I\u2019m reading in groups or studying). Having the list of what I own/have read and tbr is very helpful to me though and often useful if I\u2019m about to buy a book I own all ready but may have forgotten about (has a searchable feature).",

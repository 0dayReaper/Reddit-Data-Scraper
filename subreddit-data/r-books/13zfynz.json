It mentions local places by name, I know which roads the author is referring etc.\n\nI really struggle reading a book like this. I find it so cringey, but why? Is it because I can't imagine the events in a book actually happening in these areas, or am I just really biased.\n\nAny thoughts?",

I\u2019ve tried and all there is is one fairly decent YA novel about a kid who lives in the zoo to escape an abusive home, and one truly horrendous very bad detective novel that I couldn\u2019t get more than a few chapters into. I liked the former. But it did feel a bit surreal, especially since the places have changed a lot in the thirty years since the book was written.",

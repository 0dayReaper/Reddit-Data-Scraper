    "postText": "Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services. ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.\n\n**[But there\u2019s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**\n\nWe're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won\u2019t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.\n\n**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.\n\nTo reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.\n\nWhen you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: \n&gt; I support \"Title Two\" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.\n\nWe also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join\n\nThanks.",

Several ISPs in the US have already monopolized the hell out of their specific regions of control... there's no way they don't have plenty of money. But no, they just *have* to go and waste shit loads of it, because they want even more. Entirely motivated by self interest, they're not going to quite unless they are somehow forced. And if they win, we can say goodbye to the internet. I'm so sick of their shit.",

Don\u2019t look for it. Be happy with what you got. Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They\u2019ve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don\u2019t want: They don\u2019t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don\u2019t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They\u2019re not interested in that. That doesn\u2019t help them. Thats against their interests. Thats right. They don\u2019t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly they\u2019re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don\u2019t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they\u2019re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They\u2019ll get it. They\u2019ll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you ain\u2019t in it. You and I are not in the big club. And by the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. Good honest hard-working people -- white collar, blue collar, it doesn\u2019t matter what color shirt you have on -- good honest hard-working people continue -- these are people of modest means -- continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don\u2019t give a fuck about them. They don\u2019t give a fuck about you. They don\u2019t give a fuck about you. They don't care about you at all -- at all -- at all. And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on; the fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes everyday. Because the owners of this country know the truth: it's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.\u201d\n\n\n\u2015 George Carlin",

If you start turning in fewer profits (not even losing money, just earning less) you will lose investors, people will sell your stocks and your company runs the risk of going under.\n\nFree market Capitalism has successfully modelled itself after cancer, endlessly growing and consuming until it kills the host. This continues to happen because as a society we continue to reject every politician who advocates for corporate regulation. We are continually sold the idea that unchecked capitalism is somehow beneficial for everyone, when it is actually being used to slowly destroy all of our personal freedoms and rights.    ",

Unfortunately, our republican-controlled government is firmly on the side of corporations.

It's super frustrating that voter turnout seems to always be a struggle for Democrats, while also being something the Republicans don't really have to worry about.\n\nThat being said, you're placing too much blame on the voters themselves. Keep in mind that a lot of the Dem turnout problems are because the GOP is actively trying to disenfranchise Dem voters in states the GOP controls. They're also the masters of gerrymandering districts to be heavily skewed in their favor.",

They need that to log your opinion in their system for stats purposes, responses, and verification that you are actually their constituent. If an intern gets off the call with you and you didn't give them either of those things, there's not much she can do and your opinion can't really be officially logged. If you need to, ask if they accept email in place of street address.\n\n2) Be nice to the interns. Please.\n\n3) Make sure you're calling the right rep. The House has a resource for looking up your rep by zip code. They are not obligated to log comments by people not in their district.",

But that doesn't mean it won't still have a huge effect outside of the US if this goes through.\n\nAt this point I think it's safe to assume that most people have at least heard in passing some of the issues that YouTube creators are going through with the sweeping demonetizations. Although unlikely to happen in this case, there have been murmurings of people finding a new platform for their content (and many in the gaming community have migrated to twitch.) Without net neutrality Google could effectively bully out any potential start up platform by paying providers to have YouTube be a part of the basic bundle, while the potential new company wouldn't be able to compete, forcing people who wanted to adopt the new platform to be paying a premium for something not fully developed now while also paying for YouTube anyways as part of the base bundle. \n\nA little more relevant to the subbreddit at hand, you'd essentially be locking Amazon (and I guess Apple) into an even larger monopoly of the ebook market than it currently is for the same reasons as the YouTube analogy. Even if I in Canada and you in the EU could access these budding new companies freely, they would pretty much need to either be so revolutionary that people are willing to pay to be early adopters or they will have to be bought by a giant like Google or Amazon to even reach the US market.

How is that even a discussion? \"Oh they tried to once and it didn't work.\" Brah, fucking worry!! Care about something that affects you! Care about something other than your well researched comment that you spent an hour validating.\n\n",

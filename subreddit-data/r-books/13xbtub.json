    "postText": "I finished reading Northanger Abbey yesterday and was a bit confused about the description of how Eleanor's husband became rich. Could someone please help me understand the below lines.\n\n  \nThese are the exact lines from the book '' Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only to add--aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable--that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures. ''\n\nDoes this mean that the pages that Catherine found in her room's cupboard were somehow related to Eleanor's husband?",

            "comment": "Yes, the washing-bills that Catherine found were left behind by the servant of the man who ended up becoming Eleanor's husband. As to how exactly he bacame rich we don't know since it's not explicitly stated. We only know he had an \"unexpected accession to title and fortune\" which maybe has to do with an inheritance or something of that kind.",

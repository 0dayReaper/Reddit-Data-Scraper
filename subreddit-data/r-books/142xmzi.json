    "postText": "\"All of the sadness of the city came suddenly with the first cold rains of winter, and there were no more tops to the high white houses as you walked but only the wet blackness of the street and the closed doors of the small shops, the herb sellers, the stationery and the newspaper shops, the midwife - second class - and the hotel where Verlaine and died where I had a room on the top floor where I worked.\"\n\nIt is an amazing description, especially the contrast between the \"tops of the high white houses\" and \"the wet blackness of the street,\" but it isn't clear to me why there were no more tops to the houses, unless the tops were removed or something? I'm also not sure why the midwife is \"second class\" or what that even means in this case.\n\nAny guesses?",

The tops to the high white houses are still there, but nobody is looking that way. It does a great job of linking weather to emotion.",

It's a step up from the bottom, like on a modern airline: business class is below first class, but a step above coach, which is how most people travel. Hemingway would have been familiar with train and steamship travel, which, I believe, had multiple classes.\n\nSee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_class",

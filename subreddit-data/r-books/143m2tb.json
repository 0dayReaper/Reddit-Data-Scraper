    "postText": "Hi, just finished reading \u201ethe little friend\u201c by Donna Tartt and would love to discuss the end of the book. &gt;! I found it highly unsatisfiying that the murder wasn\u2018t solved. Additionaly I did not understand the whole thing with Harriets Epilepsy. Did she really have it and it was triggered by the watertower incident, or was it just a stress reaction? !&lt; I would love to hear your opinions",

            "comment": "The book falls apart at the incident in the car near the end. Tartt creates this ultimate scary psychotic bad guy in Farish Ratliffe and the possibility of him stalking a little girl, but then throws it all away in order to create this &gt;! bullshit last-minute Chekhov gun introduction of Danny's fear of water.!&lt; The end sequence literally makes no sense and needed some serious editing. This was all leading up to being Flannery O'Connor's version of Night of the Hunter, but ended up being, what? Maybe Tartt got some bad advice over this or maybe she just made a mistake in not sticking to a first person narrator (admittedly hard to do when Harriet would be excluded from pretty much everywhere that Farish would need to be to run his business), but I felt that The Little Friend was a wasted opportunity for what could have been a really great book.",

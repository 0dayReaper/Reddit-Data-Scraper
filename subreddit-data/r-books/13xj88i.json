    "postText": "I read this short story a few years ago, and was..... horrified. The story ends with an adult woman having sex with a ten-year-old boy, and this is for some reason not framed as a bad thing? I'm all for freedom of expression in fiction but, as a man who has experienced sexual assault by women, this really disturbed me. All the reviews I've seen of this story describe Ronette as a 'whore' and 'objectified'... but she's literally a rapist. None of them say she's a rapist. I find it very hypocritical that the boys objectifying the women is seen as bad, but a boy being raped by a woman is seen as good.\n\nWhat are other people's thoughts?",

Is it intentional and does it have a desired effect by not trying to present moral objection? We give quite a lot of power to authors letting them in. As for peoples comments, I don't even think you should be reading this one if they tend to bother you. Its far too cheap and easy for me to put this here and I didn't do shit to earn it.",

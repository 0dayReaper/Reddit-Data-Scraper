And these are like firm plans that include specific books and a tentative schedule of when they'll be completed and released (I think it goes into like maybe the 2040s or something). Then there are two cosmere planets that have only been developed through short stories that I'm pretty sure will get at least one of their own full books and maybe a series (can't remember if those were on the schedule or not). So it's more like the plan was to write like a hundred novels and then write a new schedule to try to top the last one. Perhaps the only thing more prolific than Sanderson's pen is his ambition. Fkn love this guy.",

He teaches English at BYU, ENGL 318R Advanced Creative Writing and ENGL 490, which is the same class but just the lecture instead of lecture+lab.\n\nActually, anyone who wants to can sign up the lecture part if you want, though admittance is EXTREMELY exclusive.  You have an easier time if you are a BYU student in graduate level writing classes obviously.\n\nIf anyone lives near Provo or otherwise wants to attend, he gives the requirements for signing up [here](https://faq.brandonsanderson.com/knowledge-base/application-for-byu-318-r-section-2/), but you really need to get lucky.  He has a preference for students who have written a novel or at least gotten far in the process since lab is going to involve him helping you out with your writing directly.  And obviously only accepting applications for 1 hour a year, with only ~60 spots available means the vast majority of people that want in can't get in.\n\nLuckily, for most of us it is just nice to be able to watch his lectures which he publishes online for free.",

He basically just said, \"trust me guys, it's going to be awesome.\" And over 80,000 people said, \"okay\" and gave him 20 million dollars in a few days. Imagine the kind of reputation you have to have in order to command that level of trust. On top of that, he is so good at meeting his fans that I wouldn't be surprised if he has met most of his donors at some point or another in the last decade or so.\n\nEdit: spelling",

And that series is part of a much larger universe, of which most of his adult novels are a part.\n\nIf that seems too overwhelming, don't worry, you can really enjoy most of his books on their own, or at least within their own series!  Just pointing out that if you *do* really like the book or the series, there's a lot more depth to dive into if you want :)",

They're acting surprised, both about the fan reaction and that he's raised so much money and the simple fact is - this isn't money for the *idea* of books. He's already written them and just wanted some funding to self-publish. The man just straight up *works his craft*. When you back him, you're doing so knowing he's going to deliver exactly what you want and people love it. There's really no mystery here as to why he's so popular.\n\nI'm a fan and I'll be the first to admit that his prose isn't \"literary\" (though it's much, much improved from his early work). The real draws are the absolute, heartfelt ambition of his fictional universe and the fact that you know he's not going to make it big and then \"forget\" to finish the story. He writes for fun, he's having a good time, and he wants the reader to as well. He's never going to be the guy to cash out then decide he's got writer's block and fuck off for 12 years.",

He will also very soon be starting on the 5th Stormlight Archive book, which will push as close to 500k as the editor is able to cope with most likely, with a target release date of Christmas 2023/Early 2024.  In addition, he basically has a pretty set schedule for at least half a decade into the future as to what order he is going to write things, pending some moving around projects based on how he feels.  And of course, it turns out he wrote these 4.5 books since 2020, completely outside of his contractual requirements and job.  He continues to work 8 hour days, 4 days a week on his normal projects.  If interested, he has a great article about his work-life balanced [here](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/my-work-life-balance-as-a-writer/).\n\n(Finally, if anyone has corrections or especially better word counts, let me know and I can edit)",

You could also start with the mistborn series; depending on your country it will either just be called \u201cmistborn\u201d or \u201cthe final empire\u201d. You can also start with the storm light archives with the first book, \u201cthe way of kings\u201d. Some might recommend reading Elantris after a couple of his more developed novels, but I think it\u2019s interesting to see his writing develop. Two more tips: save an entire evening for the last 1/4 of each book, and pay really close attention to what a character says if you think their appearance is random. Stay away from the coppermind wiki cause you\u2019ll get some really fun stuff spoiled. And when you start reading, DO NOT post about it or else you might get DMs trying to spoil you.",

After getting excited, he asked me if I was a writer and I told him I was only just beginning and unsure of myself and my writing skills. I\u2019m heavily paraphrasing, but his advice to me was to start writing a little bit each day and slowly work on increasing my word count. As I made progress in my goal to write each day, I would get better and better at writing. The way I took it at the time was that I shouldn\u2019t give up, no matter how bad I felt my writing was.\n\nI was extremely lucky to have met him too. It was at the FanX convention in Utah, which he often attends for book signings. At the time, I didn\u2019t know how things worked or that I needed to sign up in advance to be able to meet him. I heard he was there signing autographs and so I went to go get in the line, but the workers wouldn\u2019t let me come in because I hadn\u2019t signed up. I ended up asking one of the attendants there how to sign up in the future and she walked me through it, but right as she was finishing explaining how to do it, somehow a gap formed in the line. I\u2019m still not sure why this happened, but no one was coming up due to some admin problem going on. The attendant I was talking to grabbed me, told me it was my lucky day, and pushed me over to meet him. I was so startled at the suddenness of it, I\u2019m sure I was a bit slack jawed at first.",

I worked at NASA Goddard briefly and we had a mandatory assembly (these were common and included hundreds of people). Thing is, we had to sign up for seating on this one, and I had completely forgotten. So I'm standing in line and I finally get to the kiosk and they ask for my seating. I'm like - I totally forgot. A group of higher-ups is walking by and invite me to join them instead. So we leave the auditorium everyone was in, and go to the one across the street, which is essentially an empty movie theater except for a few admins, and a bunch of leftover cake and goodie bags they were giving out as prizes to the interns. So, because of my negligence, I ended up eating cake and winning prizes with NASA admins in an empty movie theater while everyone else was cramped into assigned seating lol. My friends were furious",

His daily word count is about 75 words a day, most authors are between 500-2000. Michael Crichton daily word count is 10.000. I would be happy if Rothfuss could increase his daily word count to just 150 and still be one of the slowest writers in history.\n\nI think only Tolkien is slower than him, and Tolkien was working on many things, his job, etc\u2026 Rothfuss has hobbies that are voluntary.\n\nDo you remember when he said that we wouldn\u2019t have the third book because\u2026 Trump won the presidency! And then when his publisher said that she didn\u2019t believe Rothfuss had written anything in the last 5 years? She paid for the third book already, long time ago, don\u2019t he owe it to her?\n\nBut apparently we are to wait without complaining.

I also understand that this isn't something most people can do, so I'm not going to rail on about it.",

It's weird to think back 25 years to when GRRM was the guy putting out a massive good fantasy book in his series every year or two like a machine.\n\nI think in a lot of ways he was mostly a victim of his own success.\n\nHe talked about this pretty openly on his blog, back around the point it was becoming clear that book 4 (was going to be Dance, became Feast, etc.) was not going to be released as quickly as 2 had followed 1 or 3 followed 2.  Basically, he had spent so much of career as a not especially successful author, and when he did become successful as the first books of ASoIaF started to take off he couldn't shake that mindset.  When someone wanted to collaborate with him or wanted him to come to their local convention in a Holiday Inn in Kansas or whatever, he always would say yes.  When people wrote him fan mail he would want to respond personally.  He was so excited that people were finally really into something he made that he didn't know how to say no or be protective of his writing time.\n\nNot sure if that's still his issue at this point, by now maybe it's just inertia.  But according to GRRM that was how his problem started.",

That would have solved the corner he's written himself into, not to mention it divides the series into two distinct trilogies with a bridge book in between. It wasn't obvious at the time of release, but seeing the mess he's made of everything logistically, the time jump in his original plan was the key to linking it all together, in my opinion.",

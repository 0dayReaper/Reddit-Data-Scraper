    "postText": "I know, this probably seems like an absurd idea to many, but I have always felt as though I have an obligation to finish any story that I begin to read, so I have been extremely hesitant to read something that I saw outside my comfort zone. I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.\n\nRecently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read \"The Slow Regard of Silent Things\" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.\n\nHas anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, but if you find yourself in a giving mood think about donating to the National Center for Family Learning or your local literacy programs!",

I can't NOT finish it at this point. I've been going strong for (I'm ashamed) 2 months. \n\nEdit: Finished it on my way home from work.  Been reading / listening off and on all day as time allowed.

There is a lot of telling instead of showing with regards to character growth, and I'm really not sure he can have major twists in every book likes he's had so far. It is ... Starting to verge on M Night Shyamalan territory. ",

May read one section at a time, something short in between as a palate cleanser, and then move on to the next section.  This is a really good tip actually and I think it might work out rather well.\n\nThe Stormlight series is the first \"monster book\" series I've ever tackled, so my experience level with these super long books is lacking.  I guess you just gotta find what works for you with these type of books as long as you have the interest level still.\n\nI think this could have worked well for me with Oathbringer, for sure.",

I could NOT get through it. I think I gave it a month before I finally gave up and I was annoyed at the time I wasted.  \n\nSimilar thing happened with My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry by Fredrick Backman.

It was kind of a turning point.\n\nIf you have trouble with it, maybe try to have a little \"ceremony\" of letting it go. Sort of, take a moment to fully express the thought that you don't enjoy it and want to let it go/look up the Wikipedia article about it (if it exists). Chances are, if you can read the little excerpt from there, you will get an idea of what you might have missed and you might find it easier to let go.\n\nIdk, I hope I wasn't too preachy or something. Hope it helps a bit :D",

For me, it's the detailed setting, the cultures and the characters.  It's the detailed descriptions, both of the environment and of the characters' actions (even the sniffs and braid tugs that people like to make fun of - it's actually a pretty decent way of showing what a character might be thinking without telling, and probably comes from Robert Jordan's passion for poker).  It's the chaotic nature of the battles.  It's how the series has a Chosen One, but his story arc is no more important than any of the others - and had any of those other arcs been resolved in any other way, he could never have succeeded.  Hell, it's also pretty cool that the series includes a number of polyamorous relationships in a way that isn't intended to be fetishised.\n\nThe setting is so detailed that from having read those books, I could easily run an RPG campaign in that world, and probably do it enough justice to help people who dislike the writing of the series at least appreciate the setting.  The characters are so well realized that I could fairly easily anticipate what they might do in a given situation.  Egwene as a character (after book 2) makes far more sense when you realise that she spent months as a slave to the Seanchan, and is suffering from PTSD as a result.\n\nOn the other hand, if you like your fantasy fast paced and action packed, you're probably not going to enjoy this series.  If you dislike made up swear words, you're probably going to find their use in this series distracting.  If the idea of waiting nearly five chapters for the inciting incident to happen and four more for the party to leave the starting village sounds boring to you, then you're probably going to be bored.\n\nAnother series I love is the Belgariad, which is the polar opposite of the Wheel of Time in almost every conceivable way - short, fast paced and action packed, with almost no purple prose and with characters written in an engaging and entertaining manner.",

It clearly got greenlit in the post-Twilight vampire cash grab, and was the worst kind of \"chosen one\" Mary Sue authorial self-insert, with the twist that Harkness is an English professor and so her Mary Sue was an impossibly young accomplished academic. (Who was also the witchiest witch to ever witch.)\n\nI gave up when all the good vampires invited Dr. Sue to do *vampire yoga* with them, doing sun salutations in an English manor house to the strains of Elton John's \"Rocket Man\" (I am not making this up).",

The books I read are almost always highly regarded, popular, or some such so it's not like I'm closing my eyes and grabbing off the convenience store shelf. I think that somehow makes a difference. I could drop a \"nobody\" book with less issue, but I almost never read them. Reading classics, reading Hugo/Nebula winners/nominees, even if I'm not liking it, I push onward and try to figure out what makes it tick.\n\nMy two big examples are Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson and Use of Weapons by Iain M. Banks. Both very popular, fairly often recommended novels in my circles and relevant book subs. I thought Crypto, while having fun dialogue at times, was a hell of a slog leading to nowhere I wanted to go. I almost quit at one-third, one-half, two-thirds... Pushed through and don't know why I did. Use of Weapons was shorter and that made it easier, and it was maybe a little more interesting, but I hated the structure of the book and found it only hampered my experience and gave nothing worthwhile back. But I do find the Culture interesting, I guess that helped me stick on with it.\n\nWill I change my behaviour? haha, probably not...",

It \"amped-up\" the first trilogy's hopelessness and grimness 'til I found it intolerable.   I saw no point in torturing myself further, and stopped with no regrets.",

As an English major and now an English teacher, I always felt some kind of duty or obligation to at least finish, but one day I just said.... fuck it. I'm an adult. I'm doing this for fun. If it isn't fun, then I'm going to find something that is.\n\nIt was the most liberating thing I've felt in a long, long while. I just wish I had had that moment earlier than four or five hundred pages into The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. It was the book that broke me.",

Everything around here is by people forcing themselves to read, reading their first book, or acting like they just unearthed some hidden gem after reading fucking 1984\n\nIt feels like the bar for a book discussion subreddit is being set by illiterate people",

It got to a point where the story was jumping from group to group, and I stopped when I was reading about some characters and I asked myself, \"Who even are these people? And what does this have to do with anything else that's happening?\" It's like the author needed some filler to pad out the length of the novel, so they grabbed a couple rando characters that had been mentioned at one point, and inserted a random little side story about what they were up to.",

I feel that anyone who reads my work is, at the start of the reading, doing me a favour and giving me their time.\n\nBut it's a contract, we've entered into an agreement. I ask you to set aside several hours of your life and respect me as an artist, and in return I promise to entertain you. After we've finished the transaction perhaps there's room for re-negotiation, perhaps I entertained you so well that now you're asking *me* for entertainment in exchange for your money, but that's for known authors, trusted authors, as a first timer it's me making an offer to you; your time for my imaginary delights.\n\nSo why the hell shouldn't you put the book down if it's shit? As far as I'm concerned that's a breach of contract on the part of the writer. If you're 50% of the way through my book and you're bored then I've failed you, I haven't held up my side of the bargain, and you shouldn't either.",

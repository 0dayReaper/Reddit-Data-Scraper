    "postText": "\nI have been trying to work out how to talk about this book for a while but the most comprehensive thing I can come up with is that it's a must read for everyone.\nThis is anti-war literature at its finest and brutalist.\n\n'All Quiet' is based on Remarque's own experiences as a German soldier on the front line in WW1, and follows the perspective of 19 year old Paul Baumer. The book was censored by the Americans to make it more digestible, and banned and burned by the Nazis for being defeatist. The images described are graphic but they aren't there to be sensationalist - they're there to press the fact that these were images seared into the minds of boys and men who would live with them for the remainder of their lives.\nThe biggest takeaway from this book is that people are people, no matter where they're from. Our humanity blurs the distinctions between sides. It is devastating that this is a lesson we as a species are yet to learn.\n\nYou should definitely read it if h are into war related novels. Its such a good read and so well written",

It was the equivalent of being out on the town with your drunken friend and they pick a fight they can't win. On the one hand, you know it's a dumb fight. On the other hand, he *is* your friend.\n\nFor the Germans, they were stuck with the declining Austro-Hungarian Empire as their drunken friend. The Austro-Hungarians decided to pick a fight they couldn't win and expected the Germans to bail them out - and when the Germans did, the rest of the world piled on the Germans.",

According to the introduction, he wrote it within a decade after the war, then re-wrote it in various tones depending on his present point of view. The Nazi's held the second or third version in high esteem, although Junger apparently didn't want to be held up as an icon. This version could have been the 1964 version, but the translator wasn't positive that it wasn't even later than that.  \nThere have been several translations of this &amp; the one that did this book took another to task for an improper job, citing examples &amp; even going so far as to say he didn't know German well, so be careful when choosing a translation, I guess. If I'd known, I would have researched it before reading. I suggest that anyone interested do so.",

At least not anything that's remotely consistent. \n\nYou can have plenty of books that talk about how war is horrible, nobody disputes that, but at the same time people rarely dispute the idea that avoiding war is always better. \n\nA particular war can be pointless and horrible, but war in general is too broad to categorize like that.",

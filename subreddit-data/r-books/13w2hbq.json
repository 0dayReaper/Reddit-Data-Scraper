    "postText": "It feels like all Hollywood does is remake old movies and butcher books. I'm tired of it. I wish they'd come up with something new. But sometimes, in books, it's SO much fun!\nOne of my favorite fairy tale redos is a Cinderella retelling by an author named Rachel Morgan. (FANTASTIC series that I highly recommend!) I've also recently found a Hansel and Gretel retelling that was really good. But when does the book industry become just like Hollywood??\nIs there a difference? Are books exempt from the overtelling rule? Every story has probably been told thousands of times over the years, but we authors keep writing. What do you think? Are books different just because it's the reader's unique imagination that gives us what we like and don't like? Or are we all just repeating, rewriting, and retelling over and over, then over again? Thoughts? Feelings? General emotions???",

My first experience with really loving a fairy tale re-write was Confessions of a Wicked Stepsister by Gregory Maguire.  More recently I read a YA series by Marissa Meyer that expanded Cinderella, Rapunzel, The Ice Queen, etc. into a wonderfully culturally diverse cast in a well written universe (and good stories).",

You can lean into the fairy tale to get good or bad endings, generate magic or get things done.  Or you can forge a new fairy tale.  Sometimes you want out of the fairy tale and a fairy godmother comes along to drain away all the magic in your life so you can be 'normal'.",

            "comment": "I love a good fairy tale retelling or a fairy tale inspired book, especially when they've managed a genuinely fresh take on the story. For me personally, my favourites are those where the characters are made more diverse than in the originals; as a queer disabled person who adored fairy tales growing up, I always felt sad to never see myself reflected in these stories, and many friends who are POC have expressed a similar sentiment in relation to the majority of the heroes being white. I feel like these books rekindle my nostalgic love for the original, whilst also letting my inner child finally feel like she could be a part of one of these fantastical tales :)",

I found a Red Riding Hood retelling several years ago that was written in a steampunk book, where Red Riding Hood wore the hood because of a wolf attack that left her badly scarred. I LOVED that! It was such an interesting take on the old tale. What's your favorite story that's a retelling?????",

One I read recently which I really enjoyed was Cinderella Is Dead by Kalynn Bayron; it's set sometime after Cinderella's death and  women are now forced to attend balls to be \"chosen\" as a wife. The main character is a queer teenager named Sophia who is about to enter the ball circuit.\n\nAnother really good one is The Pathways Tree series by F. D. Lee, the first book is called The Fairy's Tale. It follows a Fairy Godmother in training, in a universe where the classic fairy tale narratives/tropes need to be played out over and over in order to use the belief in magic as a source of power. Really interesting concept, great characters, and can be both funny and heartbreaking in equal measure.",

There is neither modernism nor postmodernism, just endless experimentation with form that has existed since day one, and it's not a bad thing. It's natural that each generation in learning life's lessons for themselves rewrites the old texts and rediscovers fire.",

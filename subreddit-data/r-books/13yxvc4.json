    "postText": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u26ab\n\nThis is my review of \"Ellen Foster\" by Kaye Gibbons. May contain spoilers. I will try to keep to a minimum.\n\nSome of the blurb:    \n&gt;When I was little I would think of ways to kill my daddy    \nEllen Foster tells her own story, with an honesty, a perceptivity, and a quite un-self-conscious heroism. Her mother dies. She stays with her father until it becomes too dangerous. She lives with a teacher, a grandmother who blames her for her father's marriage, then with an aunt. At the close she discovers a home where at last she is wanted and loved.\n\nNow my opinion:    \nI was skeptical of the book for the first 30-40 pages. The book is written like a stream of consciousness of Ellen Foster, the main character. Punctuation is lacking and sometimes her thoughts and the things others say to her melt together. Ellen Foster also jumps back and forth between the past and the present with no warning, which was at first jarring and also felt like it slowed down the plot.    \nBut then suddenly I was hooked. As the past kept approaching the present, more and more pieces fell into place and I was itching to find out exactly how she ended up with the things she tells of the present time.\n\nSome quotes:    \n&gt;Why don't you eat? he wants to know.    \nI don't have an appetite, I say back.    \nWell, you better eat. Your mama looks like this might be her last supper.    \nHe is sure he's funny that he laughs at his own self\n\n&gt;I always want to lay here. And she moves her arm up and I push my head down by her side. And I will crawl in and make room for myself. My heart can be the one that beats. And hers has stopped.\n\nMy only gripe with this book is that Ellen says some things in the second half of the book, which no 11 year old or 13 year old would say, even a well-read one. It felt a little bit like the author slipped away from Ellen's voice and into her own.\n\nDespite what the content matter may suggest, this is not a sad book (most of the time). The more negative events of the book are already filtered through the perspective of a child, who keeps the sad stuff brief (probably to protect her own sanity). Her resilience gives the reader more hope than sorrow.\n\nI found this book at the thrift store for $1. It caught my eye because the spine is plain white with a legible font, which is usually a green flag for books I like to read. All in all, this was well worth a read. When I was about 60% done, I would have given it 3 stars out of 5. Now that I am all finished, I'd say 4 out of 5 starts. May even re-read it in the future.\n\nThanks for your time. Have a good day now!",

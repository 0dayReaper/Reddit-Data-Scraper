            "comment": "\u201cThis week, the nonprofit Little Free Library announced the launch of its Indigenous Library Program nationwide and in Canada. The initiative\u2019s focus is to \u201cincrease book access in Indigenous communities to help improve literacy outcomes and ignite a love of reading.\u201d \n\nOrganizers are specifically targeting book deserts in Indian Country.  \n\nAs part of the grant package the library boxes come with 50 books \u2014 half with titles that are BIPOC-centered, and the others focused on the Indigenous experience. The collections include a variety of reading levels and were picked by a Native advisory group made up of seven members from tribal nations across the country. \n\nTwo of the first three Indigenous nations taking part in the program are from Minnesota: Red Lake and White Earth. The third is in Mandaree, North Dakota. However, she said they\u2019ve received applications from other tribes from around the U.S and Canada. \n\nSince 2009, Little Free Library programs have shared over 300 million books. To learn more about the Indigenous Library Program or to donate visit [Littlefreelibrary.org](https://littlefreelibrary.org).\u201d",

Their website kits are of course marked up as opposed to doing a DIY thing, but they literally host free plans too.

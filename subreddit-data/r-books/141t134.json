    "postText": "So basically every month I add more books to my TBR (on Goodreads, currently at 1100 books on TBR) and watch booktube videos for more inspiration. I go to the library several times a month, and get more books. I also already have books that I own at home, and I also get a monthly new book through Book of the Month.  \n\n\nI often feel super inspired but also overwhelmed by the choices. There are too many books in my immediate vicinity and in the world in general. Once I am reading a book and immersed in the story, I have no problem focusing on it and reading it, but after each book I feel super overwhelmed. Anyone else?",

These are books that I am pretty sure I will enjoy; they're recs from trusted friends/family, the author is one I already enjoy, the reviews are convincing. Then I have another list of recommendations by people who may rave about how amazing a book is but I don't quite trust their judgement yet. Also, it seems like you're collecting more than actually building your TBR list. This is what I do with my steam library \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I don\u2019t really stress about what to pick, I usually have a few calling out to me for the past week, but when it comes down to literally picking out the book I go with the moment.  \n\nThere is no wrong choice, just variations of good choices.  Sometimes it\u2019ll be the newest thing I got in, sometimes a book I\u2019d forgot I had, a book similar or dissimilar to the one I just read.  Rereads are always compelling and often come about through a different book referencing it. \n\nOne neat trick, I will often read between 3-7 books at a time which puts even less pressure on any individual choice (not the reason I do it but a good possible workaround)",

I don't keep a TBR because my reading pace loosely matches the rate of me finding new books I'm interested in, but if I had a huge TBR I would see that as a sign to be WAY more selective. Ideally you want to be picky enough that you don't get a backlog at all, in my opinion, though exactly what that number is varies depending how much you read.",

Basically, is your physical TBR pile growing, staying constant, or shrinking? \n\nI lose motivation to read if I start to feel pressure or feel like I'm falling behind. I set up rules for myself so my TBR pile doesn't feel like an ever-growing list of things I have to do. \n\nWhen we moved 3 years ago I purged 95% of my books and basically started with a small box of books that I planned to read within 2 years. I'm on year 3 so one of my goals is to read the last few books that moved with me or release them without reading if I don't get to them this year. I read a lot (174 books last year) so if I haven't gotten to them, they clearly aren't that interesting to me. \n\nI set a limit of 200 books between my To-Read pile on Storygraph, my physical bookshelf and a list of books that look interesting I have on my phone. I remove these books when I read them or put them in my library queue. When I get above 200 I go through and look for books to purge. When I get close to my limit I also reduce the amount of time I look at book-related social media, so I'm less tempted. \n\nThat's how I keep my options from becoming overwhelming. I use goals and challenges to help me decide what to read next. I find this keeps me motivated and helps narrow down my options. \n\nLast year I wanted to explore new genres so I joined an online book club that had a Genre of the Month Challenge with a new genre each month and 4 prompts to complete, it was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot about genres I rarely read. I also set a personal goal by selecting 6 fiction and 6 nonfiction genres/topics with the goal to read 2 books from each. \n\nThis year I'm exploring fiction and nonfiction books by authors from 195 countries, about half the books I read each month are for this challenge. I also set a goal to read the last of the books that moved with me, to finish 3 series I've been working on for a while, and to read the books I've purchased since my move. This is a very specific list and it helps me choose what to put on my library queue, which I then just read what becomes available next.",

I feel like if I would \"lock\" my TBR and not be allowed to read outside of a predetermined list, I would feel accomplished and satisfied to see the list grow smaller and smaller. The reading challenges that I do help a lot with reading different types of books and staying on track with the list of chosen books for that challenge.\n\nIf I kept reading at the rate I'm reading now, I could read all of my TBR list in 5ish years. But 5 years is an impossibly long time to not find new books and want to read those too!",

Let's say I was ready Harry Potter (I'm not, just the first book series that came to mind) and I was reading the 7th and lastbook next for my series book. For the single before that I might pick up the first book of The Hunger Games trilogy just to see if I like it, and if I like it I'd continue with the second one after 3 more books. \n\nStill not sure those last paragraphs were clear...",

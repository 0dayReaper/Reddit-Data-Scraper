    "postText": "I started this book with a very open mind - the idea of a book based on two nerdy best friends making video games together certainly doesn't seem like something I would normally be into, but hey, I wouldn't have thought a book about an old butler talking about buttling would be interesting either, and *The Remains of the Day* is one of my favorite books of all time. \n\nUltimately though, I got to the halfway point of this book and had to DNF, my first DNF of a novel in quite some time. I though the characters were the weakest and least interesting of any book I've read in a while. Sam and Sadie were both absolutely insufferable to me, and Marx was nice but so bland that I didn't get any enjoyment out of his character either. \n\nI also felt that the book dealt with its issues in a very young adult oriented drama sort of way. All the difficult topics that the book tries to take on seem incredibly on the nose to me. For instance, I didn't think Sadie's relationship with Dov was depicted in a very adept way - it felt much more like it was intended to be something a teenage girl could relate to. Which of course is fine, there's certainly a place for that sort of writing in the world, but it doesn't seem like the level of writing I would expect to receive such critical acclaim.\n\nOverall I'm mainly just having a hard time understanding the praise for this book. I don't see a problem with others liking it, but this book seriously won Goodreads' best fiction award for 2022? I just don't see that at all.",

This was a comment I left on another thread:\n\n&gt;Same, and I couldn\u2019t understand the absolutely glowing effusive praise I was seeing all over the internet. I read it with a book club and we all agreed there were some really nice moments, but the writing overall just had a lot of baffling choices, and the characters didn\u2019t feel like actual people. Someone mentioned that it almost seemed like the author hadn\u2019t experienced grief despite it being a huge theme of the book, and another chimed in that they likely weren\u2019t a parent either. The book started off strong and was pretty good through the middle, but by the final third I was completely checked out.\n\nAlso, I feel like in this day and age you can\u2019t just [BIG SPOILER] &gt;!throw in a workplace shooting!&lt; to move the plot forward and not properly deal with the implications of that?? In my opinion, it was handled very poorly and also didn\u2019t succeed at changing the character dynamics in any meaningful way. That last portion of the book felt like a mess.",

I really liked the book in the beginning as a tale about two people who loved each other but kept getting in their own way, faltered toward the middle when the abusive relationship began, and then that happened. I didn\u2019t DNF because I wanted to see if it redeemed itself, but I think between the abuser being presented as a \u201cbad boyfriend\u201d in the end, as well as this being thrown in for shock value and emotional manipulation, I kind of wish I had stopped reading.",

The character suffered their whole lives and were stuck in these cycles of abuse/depression/trauma over a span 20 years. There was no light or upside. By the end the characters were insufferable and the reader was taken down the same path. I'm glad I'm onto something better now",

They are both toxic individuals, are terrible friends, and both had zero character growth. The author went into huge detail about games pretty much everyone knows the basic mechanics of, like Super Mario Bros, but used archaic words pretty much every other page without providing any further context for those words, which gave off a very pretentious attitude. Learning the ins and outs of game design would've been fascinating if perhaps a different author wrote this. Some reviews said the author really must be a gamer because she knows so much, but I didn't get that vibe at all. \n\nI really don't understand the acclaim and so many people constantly qualifying their praise with, \"I'm not a gamer, but I loved it!\" I am a gamer and the book was awful. Also, you don't have to be the thing you're reading about to understand/appreciate/enjoy it. It's almost like people really don't want to be assumed to be a gamer, like it's a bad thing, if they wound up liking this book.",

My guess is that Zevin is a gamer from a different era who hasn\u2019t gamed much since the era of side scrollers, which the book goes past. \n\nAlso the word choice looks like she used MS Word\u2019s synonym option in the drop-down when she felt like using a big word. I\u2019m a fan of more florid writing like Rushdie\u2019s and, of course, Faulkner but the word has to fit. Who uses \u201cjejune\u201d in regular conversation?

And it\u2019s one of my favorite episodes of television. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to like these characters. They\u2019re not exactly likable. They\u2019re full of their own ambition and insecurity. They\u2019re constantly trying to make their way in the world and are incredibly flawed individuals. Their coping mechanisms are trash. And Sadie\u2019s relationship with Dov is horrendous but not unusual. Actually, her relationship kind of reminded me of Marianne in Normal People. \n\nI like books with flawed characters who aren\u2019t going to show drastic personality changes. The book is just about them being humanly imperfect and frustrating. I find it interesting that you loved The Remains of the Day but call this one a slog. I didn\u2019t dislike The Remains of the Day but I wouldn\u2019t rank it in the top of my Ishiguro books. \n\nBut that\u2019s just me. I don\u2019t think this book is overhyped or overrated because at least it had a compelling story to me and I found how they interact with each other super interesting. We\u2019ve all had friends from our childhood and seeing how their progression into adulthood works out is intriguing. \n\nA book that I think is incredibly overhyped and not worth the stars it gets on Goodreads is Project Hail Mary. I don\u2019t think this book needs to stick every landing, but I enjoyed how it approached characters who weren\u2019t the generic characters you get in books.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if it didn\u2019t tickle your fancy. But I don\u2019t think it wins the overrated tag. You\u2019re not going to like every book out there.",

But it continues.\n\nThe whole Anna Lee suicide sequence is a particularly egregious example, where a dying woman manages a whole conversation about the stage actor\u2019s union while lying with a broken neck losing \u2018copious amounts of blood.\u2019 Immediately after this, Sam\u2019s mum rushes to find him in the bodega, where we\u2019re treated to this mad NPC interaction:\n\n\u2018\u201cYou\u2019re the mother,\u201d the shopkeeper said. \u201cWhat a world. What a thing for a boy to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t leave, did he?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but he was quite distraught, so I gave him quarters to play the machine in the back of my store. Children love games, though the machine doesn\u2019t make as much money for me as it once did.\u201d\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s when you notice the same thing happening in prose that you realise we\u2019re meant to take this kind of dialogue seriously - because it\u2019s all the author knows how to do:\n\n\u2018Sam sat on the bed next to her, and she offered him the joint, which he refused. [\u2026] The only drugs he\u2019d ever taken were whatever painkillers he\u2019d been given in hospital, and he hadn\u2019t liked the way they had clouded his ability to think. [\u2026] Because of this experience, Sam often suffered through pain that probably should have and could have been somewhat ameliorated.\u2019\n\nThese traits should be well established by this point in the book. All we should need after \u2018refused\u2019 is a pause, or an \u2018as expected\u2019 - but instead we get about a page of boring and unnecessary character exposition.\n\nI really wanted to like this novel for its original setting but the writing just killed it for me.",

Its a stark and honest book about people, trauma and the limits of empathy. It'll be one of the more significant books of the 2020s and fully deserves it.

It's a book about how the stuff from our childhood can lock us into destructive patterns for the rest of our lives. The fact that it doesn't have that cinematic ending where everything gets fixed and they get over their issues is a big point of the work. The relevant question re: Sam and Sadie isn't \"can they get over their issues and 'fix' themselves?\" it's \"can they maintain a friendship despite never really getting over their issues? (And closely ties into the video game theme in that one of the things that appeals to them about games is that you get infinite chances to do things over and get things right, but real life doesn't allow for that.)\n\nIf you're a reader that needs likable characters or conventional plot structures then this probably isn't the book for you. But that doesn't mean the author wrote it wrong or that the book is \"bad.\"",

Im curious if jam packing in every social issue caused the book to flag to everyone or something. My SIL who is not a gamer and who does not read fiction most of the time has it recommended in her queue, and I cannot see her making it through it nevermind enjoying it.

But in the US, and maybe the Anglosphere in general, there's a certain...I don't know. Let me give an example: Bunny by Mona Awad. It's smart book with a fresh premise, original style, fun to read, but the ending came off as quite \"self help life lesson-y\", and I've noticed similar things happening with other critically acclaimed and/or \"literary\" American books published in the last 5 years or so.\n\nI feel like it's political, with American critics giving bonus profundity points to books that show the \"right\" view on the topics of the day (racism, sexism, mental health, etc.) without also demanding they use big words or show moral nuance or touch on those issues in a way that feels authentic. (They seem to live comfortable enough lives that they probably don't even know what authentic looks like.) Or maybe it's just American culture, the typical European complaint of how Americans choose optimism over depth, but of course that doesn't explain Faulkner's success then and the seeming lack of Faulkners now. (I think most likely modern Faulkners do exist, they're just being published by much smaller presses.)",

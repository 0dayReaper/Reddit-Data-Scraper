The generic \"top university\" rankings are often heavily weighted by things which have little to no impact on the quality of the undergraduate education.\n\nApparently the university of Loughborough is ranked as top in the world for sports related degrees, but it's hardly coming to mind when discussing the top British universities.",

There is no absolute scale for rating. You can only compare against your classmates, your schoolmates, your generation's other students, etc. For comparison against your classmates, you look at the grade of the class. For comparison against your schoolmates, you look at GPA. For comparison against your generation, you look at some standardized tests like the SATs, ACTs, etc. None of these are individually useful in a vacuum, and that is the policy that would be used in graduate school admission, for example. \n\nYou know what the grade inflation at Harvard does for a person coming out of Harvard? The grades themselves are meaningless. Your A- reveals no information. Your entrance into Harvard is a completely different bit of information which distinguishes you from Podunk University of Podunksville, but your grade has no meaning. That's all.",

Those who do manage to get rewarded with massive six figure salaries to be a bureaucrat at schools they barely visit that have to fundraise for books and pay frontline staff essentially minimum wage. (Edit: Google \"Craig Tunstall\" if you want to be sick.) It is absolutely inclined towards class rather than knowledge and inquiry, including the emphasis on things like handwriting rather than content and using certain vocabulary terms rather than demonstrating actual understanding of a concept. Tons of corruption abound as well in relation to special needs and low performing students (which they are fully aware is tied to income) and shortcutting them out of resources or being pressured to outright lie about their progress and/or write them off.  Of course it seems the opposite but this is the mouth saying one thing and the hands doing the opposite.\n\nMost teachers know this and either compromise and play along, do their best to somehow work effectively within this system, leave, or get run out.\n\nTLDR: Even when school in the UK isn't run by this algorithm, it may as well be for how the system is geared.",

There probably was no way to make the algorithm fairer\n\nThat being said. It seems so morally wrong to me to put an algorithm in charge of student grades. Grades are only fair if determined by individual performance in unbiased exams.\n\nI have been a big advocate for masks, staying home, being careful with covid since the start, but it seems to me that the right choice here was to let students sit exams. Perhaps it was not the safest thing but I'll gladly trade some safety for knowing the grading system is only based on individual merit",

Hadn't heard - thank you.\n\nIt was reversed, but basically in the worst way.\n\nThey waited until after the results were out and uni's had finalised offers. Meaning that when the grades were reversed, there were a ton of kids who now had the grades for their first choice course, but the uni had already filled their courses, so they still couldn't go. And most courses have government mandated limits on how many more students vs last year that they could take, so they couldn't expand. \n\nThen the government went \"Ok, you *will* get your first choice uni, but you might have to wait until next year\". \n\nWhich of course means that next year, loads of courses will start with loads of places filled by people from this year, so next years kids are at a disadvantage too.\n\nHonestly, I think we might be seeing the beginning of the end of the current political age in the UK, because the tories seem to be entirely out to piss off anyone under 50. We've just had the people who were denied a vote on Brexit because they were 16/17, now they're adding a load of people who are going \"the fucked me about with that algorithm because of where I was born\".",

Basically, they asked the teacher to rank all their students from best to worst, then applied scores based on what the best and worst students in that class have historically managed.\n\nThe idea was that because some schools are easier than others, they couldn't predict test scores by coursework grades alone.\n\nThe problem, however, is that there could have been outliers in that year's class. Students who were either much better than the historical average of the best students in that class, or else much worse, and their grade wouldn't end up reflecting this.",

These are the big ones, GCSEs and A levels respectively. the A levels particularly determine whether you get into the first or second college or university of your choice. \n\nDue to the cancellation of exams, teachers were asked to provide an expected grade for each person based on their work over the previous 2 years and their mock exam results. \n\nInstead of awarding these grades, the government then directed the exam boards to run these predicted grades through an algorithm that took into account the previous results from that particular school. \n\nThe result? The majority of students from schools in poorer areas received results (in some cases 3 grades) lower than predicted, while richer areas had their results raised. \n\nWhile it wasn't meant to do this in concept, it was meant to ensure teachers were not unfairly generous, unfortunately it generally happens that schools in poor areas do worse. (Socioeconomic deprivation etc). Therefore, those schools were hit very harshly by the algorithm.\n\nThe students worse hit were the exceptional outliers in these poor schools. Brilliant students who had worked their way through their tough circumstances only to have their As turned to Cs and Ds. \n\nThink back to those times, you work your butt off for 12 years only to have it ripped away by an algorithm because you live somewhere poor. It's a terrible scandal that I don't think many outside really understand.",

Lowest band was Grey District where whole families would live in a one room apartment and have jobs like road sweeper and litter picker and the higher bands were Scarlet and White which have the lovely big houses and the good jobs\n\nWhole premise of the book (first in a trilogy) is the older children in the family rebelling against it, having to flee the city, and then trying to overthrow the regime",

Universities were more or less organized into tiers with a clear hierarchy so instead of looking at a specific school of interest you would be looking at any schools in that tier which you have a chance of getting into. The only admission criteria is the score for the exam: generally speaking, anyone above a cutoff point are welcomed to all programs in all universities in the band.\n\nAnd the school you go to directly changes what kind of job you can get post graduation, or your possibility of getting into grad schools. No matter how good you are during your university years, the chance of landing a dream job after graduating from a shit school is statistically irrelevant. \n\nPeople from top tier schools get scholarship to study post-grad in world's best universities, go into big corporations, become government consultants... people from several lower tiers of universities get different types of middle class careers , people who graduate from non-degree programs get into comfy trades, and people who can't get into a university - the majority of population - go to factories and drive taxis. There are chances of social mobility after that but it's a minority.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, your fate is sealed in the two days of writing the exam, at the age of eighteen.

Set in 2029, it imagined a system where students were sorted into bands based on their background. \u201cMum still thinks I can be a doctor. She doesn\u2019t understand how hard it is to get into Band 1 for people like us,\u201d says a character in the story.\n\n&gt;Johnson had her English A-level result downgraded from A to B and lost her place at the University of St Andrews before the government\u2019s U-turn on Monday. Now that results will be based on teacher assessments instead, she is hopeful that her place will be restored.\n\n&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve been so stressed and anxious these past few days, waiting to hear back from universities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got told you can go wherever you want in life if you work hard enough, but we\u2019ve seen this year that no matter how hard you worked, you got given a grade based on where you live.\u201d\n\n&gt;Prof Jean Seaton, director of the Orwell prize, said: \u201cJessica saw into the heart of what the system represents and her story demonstrates the human ability which exams only exist to uncover.\u201d\n\n&gt;Johnson said the inspiration behind her writing was to mix educational inequality with the dystopian genre. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a fairy tale I wanted to come true!\u201d",

As a result, students in worse performing schools that were on for As might have been downgraded to Bs or Cs, whereas those at better performing schools might have had the reverse happen.\n\nOf course school performance is linked heavily to how rich the area is, and as a result it was seen (Not unjustly) as a new form of class warfare. On top of that there were a few cases where students were discouraged from contesting their results, such as an education ombudsman telling students that if they do it and get bumped up a grade, they're causing someone else to drop a grade.\n\nIn all it was a major fuckup, the government tried shifting the blame onto students/schools, and after a *lot* of people got pissed off the government backtracked.",

When we asked them how they separated they said by grade level. I told them I had a 98 in math. Did everyone in A and B have 99s and 100s? Teacher looked at me straight in the face and said yes.  \n\nFast forward a year to 8th grade, A and B group took pre algebra while the rest of us took more remedial math type of course. We all had mixed group home room, so during home room, two of the A group asked me for help with pre algebra. I never saw it but I'd read the couple pages then read the examples they wrote down then would show them. At the end of the year, the math teacher had to sign off on what math we went into. If you done pre algebra she'd sign you up for algebra and you'd be able to complete college course math in high school. If not, you were put into another remedial math, then 10th grade pre algebra (you read that right), then 11th algebra 1, 12th algebra 2.  \n\nI went up to the teacher at the end to get my paper signed for what class she was going to put me in. She looked at me and looked kinda troubled then even though I saw her use the top stamp on everyone in my group C (for remedial math in high school) she looked at me and asked, \"I feel like I've seen your handwriting alot this semester. Do you know what I mean?\" I'd do an example or two while teaching two A group students and they never erased. I hesitated and said, \"yeah\" and she frowned and looked down and stamped me in for algebra 1 saying \"I believe you can do it.\" which put me on a college pathway I may not have otherwise pursued.  \n\nSorting by class just showed me that those who have, will keep, and those who don't, will struggle. It's just another way to halt upward mobility in this country.",

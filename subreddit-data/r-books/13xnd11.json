Why do some people hate him so much? Is there a \"stereotype\" of someone that reads him?",

Plenty of unquestionably feminist authors do too. I just think it would come down to other aspects of the writing. \n\nFor sure-there are male writers who do a terrible job writing female points of view. Updike, Mailer-so many celebrated mid century authors just suck at this and I don\u2019t enjoy them for this and other reasons.  But if Franzen is doing the same thing, I think there would be better examples than this. \n\nAnd for the record I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to not want to read his books because they are portraits of people and attitudes you don\u2019t want to read about.

I don't know anything about franzen, but actually Coldplay is particularly bad to me, I even like a lot of popular music (in passing).  I think you are making a lot of assumptions about taste here, because someone like me may actually think that Coldplay is \"the worst\" even if you just think it's \"meh\". we can't really account for taste. But in the context of this post, we are talking about dating and so it's not just overreacting, it's a preference like any other. Like I wouldn't date a vegan for instance even though I have nothing against veganism but sharing food is important to me and I also hunt. That said I actually wonder if the person OP talked to that called Franzen a \"Red Flag\" was thinking of John Grisham or Jordan Peterson and didn't even know who they were talking about. That makes more sense than being offended by a mediocre author. Coldplay though, really makes me feel bad for some reason. I'm definitely sensitive to noise though.",

            "comment": "The Corrections is objectively great, but has the kind of pre-September 11th concerns that became less fashionable after 9-11 made (white) American writers more conscious and marketable if they attempted to address issues larger than their own specific cultural biases.  The narcissism of Chip and the postmodern feminist struggles of Denise just became more myopic-seeming after America (and American culture) was attacked in 2001.\n\nFranzen actively seemed to try and address this cultural revision in Freedom, and he just isn\u2019t good at writing that kind of American novel.  His non-fiction is much better at deconstructing American culture and it\u2019s inherent conflicts.\n\nPurity was a weird book, and I liked it, but it actively resisted being an \u201cAmerican novel\u201d other than its protagonist being the archetypal naive and worldly-ignorant American.\n\nAll of this is of course I think inflamed by Franzen\u2019s insistence of refusing Oprah\u2019s invitation to have The Corrections be in her book club, and also from the Time Magazine cover that basically stipulated  him as the literal trademarked Great American Novelist who would write \u201cThe Great American Novel.\u201d  The disjointed and try-hard nature of Freedom is a result of this.\n\nI devoured all of these books though.  Strong Motion is really interesting too from a young Franzen, just not as confident as he was in The Corrections.\n\nAnd having finished Crossroads last year, I can say it is about as good as The Corrections, and does what Franzen does best: deconstruct the values of Anglo-Saxon (Episcopalian) middle American families.  This is a very specific thing, but a great novelist makes the localized values of people feel relatable and universal.  As an American who lives in the Midwest myself, I find his work compelling and no one really talks about the real thrust of his novels though, but sex and narcissism and addictive-obsessive behaviors are all at the heart of his best work and give it life.  The character Enid is almost as full of life in The Corrections as Marian is in Crossroads.\n\nBut he\u2019s a smug, confident white male author who comments on cultural issues and since he\u2019s earnest and sincere and not some off-the-wall Tom Robbins or Bret Easton Ellis bad boy type, fans of modern fiction have strong feelings about his CONFIDENCE.  \n\nIf he just wrote non-fiction, no one would give a shit about tearing him down all the time because his confident, research-based, world traveled earnestness plays well in the world of non-fiction writers (think Malcolm Gladwell or someone like that).\n\nHe\u2019s obviously one of the most notable authors of this century though, so he\u2019s popular because he\u2019s good, not the other way around.",

            "comment": "First of all, I hate Coldplay. \n\nOkay, that's out of the way. I have enjoyed Franzen's work more than anybody else I  have discussed it with, of which there were only two folks whose judgement meant anything to me. They were as intelligent and educated as anyone I know, moreso actually, so they had valid reasons, which they shared with me , and I easily understood where they were coming from. I was more immersed in the language and fiction to an esoteric degree, while their onus was relatively pragmatic.  At the time, I was just becoming aware and comfortable with these interactions, knowing that as often as not I would not make sense to other people, try as I might.\n\nWe were coming towards the end of a period of American Literature which I call The Great Minimalism Scare (1980-1988). I'm not certain as to the beginning, because I haven't made any effort to look. But I count the ending date as well reasoned because it coincides with the death of Raymond Carver, whom I met in Ann Arbor in 1986, and his very being screamed out MINIMALISM! He was the Shaman, credited profusely for saving the short story and bringing the language of common people back to the Academy. Some of his stories were as eternal and deep as anything ever written, and this style seemed to dominate publication for a time, predominantly in the short story genre.  After he had overcome his alcoholic idiocy, he settled into a peaceful, productive and well-funded life, a very gentle spirit to meet, inherently likeable, and so I think he might have gotten more credit just because he was, in fact, the very embodiment of the \"good guy\".\n\nAnd then you had this egghead Jonathan Franzen, spilling his fancy words all over the place, waxing sardonic of characters from the working educated, preening the WOKE before we even knew there was such thing. And selling hundreds of thousands of books with hoity-toity bucolic settings and the bourgeois values and themes that would send this country straight to Hell.\n\nAnd Oprah, the Jerry Springer of the left, loved him. She gave every guest a copy of The Corrections, placed under their seat awaiting, I imagine, their disappointment at being given one of those \"hard to read\" books.\n\nAnd Franzen was just fine with being a writer, apparently, and wanted no truck with promotion, or marketing, or any indication that the work should be compromised for the sake of the least common denominator, and therefore, the bottom line. He was happy to allow books to be books, and didn't want to be promoted by Jerry Springer, or anybody, by any measure, like Jerry Springer, strained the comparison may be.\n\nHe'd have been fine if he had simply taken his millions and said \"Thank you.\" But he questioned any gesture at literature as \"product,\" or what we would today call \"content.\" And he really fucked up when he said it out loud, in front of cameras and microphones. ON OPRAH'S VERY TURF. And so the horns of his dilemma were on the Right, with his college boy sentences and concepts, not to mention \"that Uppity Oprah bitch\", \"That's right, the one in Chicago who needs to be back in Tennessee? Yes, right,: she loves that little queer and those thick books about Democrats.\"\n\nBut where was Oprah? ON TELEVISION! And the left hated \"the least common denominator.\" Way too working class, I swear.\"  And so, Jonathan Franzen drew no surcease; he was surrounded with contempt.\n\nUnless  you actually read him. If you have any interest in Contemporary American Fiction, or even just Contemporary Fiction, you must read Jonathon Franzen. There is no way around it. He gives the reader credit for intelligence, or at the very least the ability to go on-line and use a dictionary. And he writes about a crucial subgroup of American characters, the Working Educated. The level working closest to the oligarchy, but \"not too close,\" because they are a threat. Right? I've read three of his novels, and I'm sure I will read more. He is not afraid to let the language be as elegant as it can quite rightly be. And this gives greater clarity and power to the vernacular. Do I have to mention that he writes about the concerns and lives of real people, and he shows great compassion for our fears and sorrows. He is as good as we have right now, and while not quite a Chekhov or Tolstoy, who is?",

You can call it your \"problematic dudes\" reading list.\n\nBut also don't sleep on Jhumpa Lahiri, Zadie Smith, Helen Dewitt, or Emily St. John Mandel, afaik they're less problematic human beings and equally excellent authors, and you can tell your dates you read them but keep your middle-aged-male-angst for your own.",

                            "comment": "Great idea! Here's some \"problematic\" (gah though I hate that term) women author recs:\n\nAnne Sexton. Objectively one of the greatest poets who ever lived. Sexually abused her older daughter.\n\nMarion Zimmer Bradley. Wrote the epic Arthurian retelling Mists of Avalon. Pedophile. \n\nEve Ensler. Wrote The Vagina Monologues. A feminist play about women's vaginas, which also has a scene that can very easily be viewed as romanticizing child sexual abuse.\n\nAnne Bauer. Novelist (I really liked Forgiveness 4 You) and essayist. Didn't do anything bad at all, but some of her essays have criticized covid policy so judgy people who are diehard believers in the \"covid consensus\" (credit to Thomas Fazi for the term) might hate you for reading her if they know who she is. \n\nNaomi Wolf. Wrote The Beauty Myth. Also criticized covid policy, so expect hate from the same as above. \n\nGillian Flynn. Wrote Gone Girl. Nothing bad I'm aware of in her personal life, but Amy in Gone Girl is such a polarizing character that you'll find some dates who treat liking the book as a red flag if you don't immediately follow up with disclaimers about how much you hate Amy.\n\nJK Rowling. You probably already know what the controversy is with this one if you haven't been living under a rock. \n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Novelist and essayist, probably best known for We Should All Be Feminists. Fellow writer Akwaeke Emezi had criticized her for not criticizing JK Rowling on the trans stuff, so then Adichie wrote a general anti-cancel-culture essay called It Is Obscene, which Akwaeke Emezi then accused of being an incitement to violence against them, I'm not sure where their feud is at currently but the essay It Is Obscene is great reading either way.",

It's similar to Roth where I love the books for the most part but understand that not all the characters are equally served and both authors have poorly written female characters. \n\nI think it's much more enlightening to read a book by someone who you know has those weaknesses as it still allows you to process the topic even if its from an \"I disagree\" perspective.",

He does not really have his finger on the pulse of his time the way a novelist in their prime usually does. But no one serious can deny his brilliant character development, he is a master. Whether one thinks he is using his considerable skills for anything important anymore or is their taste is another matter.",

There were a ridiculous amount of articles saying this was the best book ever written before it was even available. Jodi Picoult and others called out the obvious bias of publications for this white male author getting unearned absurd levels of attention for a new book where many other authors would never receive such attention even after multiple well-received novels and years of publishing.\n\n3) He says a lot of misanthropic curmudgeonly things about the world and people\u2019s popular behavior and it often reads as elitist and prickish.\n\nThere\u2019s more but TL; DR: He\u2019s the poster child, whether deservedly so or not, for arrogant white wealthy male artists getting undeserved special treatment and praise.",

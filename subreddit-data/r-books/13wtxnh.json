    "postText": "Right now I am reading *A Memory Called Empire* and just loving it. There are so many clever, thoughtful touches, and one in particular gave me this jolt of aesthetic pleasure that was different from, say, the pleasure I might get from beautiful prose. It was one of those things where it was an application or extension of something the reader might be familiar with, but placed in an unexpected yet perfectly fitting way within this new world the reader is learning about. I'm speaking (this is not a spoiler, though since you might want to happen upon it yourself organically I'll put it in spoiler tags) about &gt;!how when they're at the ball, some of the tipsy attendees basically start battle rapping each other. It didn't come across as if Martine was like, \"Heh, wouldn't it be cool if they battle rapped?\" but rather, an organic and considered expression of Teixcalaanli culture, where being smart means having a tremendous command of allusion, literary and historical reference, and so on; and where infrastructure is a reasonable topic to be rapped about since \"the City\" and its civil service are expected to be captivating subjects. It also had the high society flavor of fancy *salon* games of wit. So charming to me.!&lt; Do you have any favorite moments like this?",

Because of course this guy would treat a quarter like something valuable...",

Even though I really liked the book, as a poetry nerd with a particular affinity for the Tang era, I was so psyched about Martine's premise for Teixcalaanli culture but felt like mostly it was an afterthought. But that moment really made it real. Cool scene.",

One of the best bits that hooked me to the universe are the telltale hints of a past era that corroborates a historical truth preserved in its in-universe folklore. Some examples include &gt;!the children's song about the Chandrian (which is eerily haunting when I read it for the first time) and the existence of ancient pottery that suggested the Chandrian's tale was once real.!&lt;It's like finding archaeological evidence of historical figures who were later mythologized as gods.",

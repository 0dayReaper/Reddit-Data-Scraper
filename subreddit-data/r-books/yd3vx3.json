The professor said \"great can you share your screen and show me the averages?\" and I froze up because I was stuck between admitting to my lie or coming up with an obvious bs excuse. I think I just went silent and he said \"hello? something must be up with his computer\" and he asked the other TA about hers, so I just waited 2 minutes, dropped off the call and absolutely powered through the grading then sent him an email an hour later saying \"here it is, I don't know what happened with the zoom my laptop crashed\".

            "comment": "&gt;***Speaking in a live stream with Random House, Martin spoke about the latest series of House of the Dragon and the long-awaited Winds of Winter.   \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big book,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenging book. It\u2019s probably going to be a larger book than any of the previous volumes in the series.   \u201cThe Dance of Dragons and Storm of Swords were the two largest books in the series. They were both about 1500 manuscript pages. I think this one is gonna be longer than that, by the time I\u2019ve finished it.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m about 3 quarters of the way done, maybe. But that\u2019s not 100% done. So, I have to continue to work on it. \u201c  \u201cI\u2019ve given up on making predictions \\[of when it will be finished\\]. Because people press me and press me, \u2018when\u2019s it gonna be done?\u2019\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ve never lied about these predictions\u2026 But I guess I overestimate my ability to get stuff done and underestimate the amount of interruptions.\u201d  \u201cOne day it will be done. And then, it will come out. And then, the next day, someone will tweet me \u2018When will we see A Dream of Spring!?\u2019***",

But in 2016 he said he was putting aside all other writing until he finished *Winds of Winter*. In early 2017 he said he thought it would be out that year. Then in 2020 he said if it wasn't done by WorldCon 2020 to \"lock him in a cabin\" until it's done.\n\nWriters certainly have the option to change their minds and work on what they want. But it's pretty shitty to promise to finish the story (implicit in any series of works IMO, not just Martin's)  and keep choosing not to. Especially after promising over and over that you will (often within a specific time frame).",

Dany has not even left for Westeros yet, and the white walkers are barely even in the story yet. It took 5 books to wrap up the War of Five Kings, can we really expect the entirety of the Dany invasion and White Walker invasion arcs to happen in two? Surely there's like 3 or 4 books worth of plot to get through.",

That's obviously not how writing works.\n\nI liked ASoIaF alright when I was younger, but I think at this point, other than mild curiosity about Sansa's storyline, my interest in *The Winds of Winter* is not about the book itself so much as anthropological\u2014I *so* want to see the fandom reaction if and when it finally comes out.",

The site has been through a ton of changes in that time, but none that have so openly detached the core value the site provides from its userbase. Reddit is trying to become facebook groups, and IPO with a high valuation, but the strategies applied to reach that state are totally at odds with the value provided to longtime users like me. This is a bit of a complex relationship, since reddit is a YC company, and the wild ideas out of YC have really been cool!\n\nAt the end of the day, its not reddits fault. Non-federated social networks are just huge cash cows, the money is there, and thats okay. However, I'm moving full time to federated networks - they're awesome! And FYI as an OG redditor, people thought reddit was WAY too confusing and hard to use at first too. I recommend Ice Cubes for Mastodon on iOS, Elk.Zone on Web, and I've been really enjoying Kbin.Social for a federated version of Reddit. The key thing here is it doesn't really matter which one you pick, they can all see eachother and you can just move if one goes shitty, without the network going down.\n\nAlso, get a dog and go outside! Its super.",

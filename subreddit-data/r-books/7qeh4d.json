I answer all my children\u2019s letters \u2014 sometimes very hastily \u2014 but this one I lingered over. I sent him a card and I drew a picture of a Wild Thing on it. I wrote, \u201cDear Jim: I loved your card.\u201d Then I got a letter back from his mother and she said, \u201cJim loved your card so much he ate it.\u201d That to me was one of the highest compliments I\u2019ve ever received. He didn\u2019t care that it was an original Maurice Sendak drawing or anything. He saw it, he loved it, he ate it.\u201d - Maurice Sendak\n\n[source: goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/315932-once-a-little-boy-sent-me-a-charming-card-with)\n",

We would often have to stall for ten minutes with 100 kids in the room, and I\u2019d jump up and tell a story. \n\nWe\u2019d start with something simple, and a couple of other leaders would act out the story on stage. I\u2019d pause at each crucial moment and ask the kids \u2018so what do you think happened next?\u2019 Cue a dozen hands raised and lots of suggestions. When I found one that worked (or didn\u2019t work, because why not), we\u2019d go in that direction. The kids never realised that most of the jokes I told were for the leaders - they\u2019d shoot right over their heads, but they\u2019d still laugh because everyone else was into it. \n\nThose moments are precious to me, and I hope I carry them forward in my own writing. Sure, I define an audience for the publishing and segmenting of my work, but when anyone reads my work, it\u2019s a privilege, and I hope that no matter what their age, they capture a moment of joy from it.

This little boy (3 or 4?) wandered up to me and we started talking and made up this amazing story together about a planet made out of rainbows, inhabited only by \"the coolest\" tigers, and with clouds made of cotton candy.\n\nKids are the best because they don't feel embarrassed by their imagination and they don't feel limited to keeping things grounded in reality. I can picture that tiger planet in my head super clearly to this day. ",

It was only recently that I realised I spent so much of my adult life consuming content rather than creating. We\u2019re conditioned to not imagine, yet at the same time we let others do it for us.

That is where the word came from. Of course, today, we know that the spleen is involved in T cell activation (immune response) and that black bile is not a real substance whatsoever - but the etymology is still cool.",

But once you eat it, it's gone right? Like when you brought some toys to the park and buried it. We couldn't get it back and you miss some of those now.  It probably wouldn't be worth much money to someone else but it would be a really neat keepsake for y... and you're fucking eating it.

Back in high school I was really into David Eggers' books (a girl got me into them; maturity got me out), so I actually emailed him around Thanksgiving one year and told him how much we enjoyed his writing. I eventually got an email back from his assistant asking for my address, saying that Dave would like to send me something. Jump forward like two years, after I failed to receive anything from them, I emailed them back asking what that was about. They apologized and followed through--by sending me a bunch of DE books, including a signed copy of Where the Wild Things Are (his novelization). I always thought that was neat.",

The child in my screamed with joy. I went in and picked up a copy of \"Wild Thing\" and got into a very long line. After a good 45 minutes, it was my turn. \n\nGiddy, \"Hi, Mr Sendak\"\n\n\"What's the child's name\"\n\n\"Oh, this book is for me, I'm so excited\"\n\n\"Ohhhh, you need to grow up... Next\"\n\n20 years later, this memory still crushes me a little.\n",

They opened my eyes to interesting creatures in a great story.\n\nI remember when the film was coming out a few years ago, and that really dramatic/fun song was attached to one of the trailers. People thought it was going to be a great dive back into childhood, and be really an amazing experience. Unfortunately, though, we all know how it turned out.\n\nThe song used in the trailer made the trailer interesting, but unfortunately the film didn't deliver on what we saw in the trailer. Some may say \"how often does a film deliver as much as a trailer did\", but that's avoiding the issue that the film just wasn't that great for adults. For kids? They maybe loved it. But I felt like it was going to be great for adults too.",

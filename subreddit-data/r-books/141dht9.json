    "postText": "Whenever HP and its writing comes up, the strengths are usually said to be the description of the images and the character driven story, while the overall writing is okay. \n\nOne of the most repeated arguments in favor of the writing a lot of times is how the earlier books were written for children, and how they evolved over time to age with their readers.\n\nNow, I have problem with that; Or more like, am confused. I LOVED the first movies and the world. Before that I got the first book as a child. And I absolutely HATED the book. I was no big reader, but I read. And boy, I couldnt get through any amount of double digit number of pages before putting the book to the side. As a child, I found it so utterly terrible written; I only went to the movie because of friends. After the awesome first movie I tried to get back into it - Goddamn, I just couldnt stand it.\n\nAs it happens, HP content likes to hit the front page. Im still nostalgic for the movies, so I often look into the threads. As the people argue, they often cite quotes of the books. And nearly without exception, even with later books, I groan and feel put off by the writing. E.g. conversations, they never flow or feel natural for me. It all reads so bad. I know this ain't GRRM levels, but I just can't read this. And I got through Eragon back then!\n\nSo, since the latest frontpage post, this just got me wondering... Does JR have some specific style that I absolutely dont vibe with? Is the writing in general just bad and people praise it for nostalgic reasons? I cant think of any other book (granted I read only a few a year) that gets such reactions out of me. Maybe something like 50 shades of grey, but thats only from hearsay - The movies I was forced through were enough.\n\nIm just so confused because even as a kid I hated it so much, and I never warmed up to the books. Instead, it only gets worse whenever I see some book excerpt.",

If anything, I think GRRM's writing is worse than JK Rowling's, because there were definitely times when the bad prose (or the endless damn lists of foods) pulled me out of the story, and I never experienced that with Harry Potter. But this is just further proof that something like 'is this good writing', even though there may be some broad agreements (Pulitzer shit &gt; YA) can be highly subjective.",

Even if the Harry Potter books aren't particularly unique or groundbreaking in how they were written, they were easy to follow (something especially important with fantasy fiction) and engaging for the majority of an audience throughout.",

I read a lot, and always have, and thought it was a great world with lovable and hateable characters and a fun storyline. I never get all critique-y about books I read, I mostly read simply because I enjoy it. I think that when a book is utterly intolerable for us it has a lot to do with the writing just being incompatible with what we prefer to read, it doesn't always mean it's written terribly. There are some books I hate with every fiber of my being. I only read a few chapters of them, and even years later thinking of them makes me react viscerally, too. Largely because I feel my time was wasted on such tripe. But other people love the books because many of them were long-lasting best sellers. Just a difference in what we like and why.",

The books grow along with Harry, a fact that makes me appreciate the writing of the first book even more. \n\nPersonally not a fan of GRRM's writing, though I appreciate his storytelling. I read several of the ASOIAF novels but lost interest in later books as it just didn't seem to be going anywhere. But that's me, I don't go into the GoT boards asking why others enjoy it. \n\nIf you are looking for perfection, then perhaps human writers aren't the choice.

I honestly couldn't tell, I wouldn't be aware of that as a kid when I disliked it as much as I did.

YA content is good when there's some kinda underlying theme or message or something deeper. Joanne just kinda writes... which a lot of people need and want and adore. \n\nI found the movies a lot more palatable. The actors and directors find a lot of meaning in situations and lines that isn't really there in the book, which kinda gives it another layer and makes it work... when it works.",

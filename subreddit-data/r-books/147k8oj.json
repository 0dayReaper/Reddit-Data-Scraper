We want to know!\n\nWe're displaying the books found in this thread in the book strip at the top of the page. If you want the books you're reading included, use the formatting below.\n\n**Formatting your book info**\n\nPost your book info in this format:\n\n**the title, by the author** \n\nFor example:\n\n**The Bogus Title, by Stephen King**\n\n* This formatting is voluntary but will help us include your selections in the book strip banner.\n\n* Entering your book data in this format will make it easy to collect the data, and the bold text will make the books titles stand out and might be a little easier to read.\n\n* Enter as many books per post as you like but only the parent comments will be included. Replies to parent comments will be ignored for data collection.\n\n* To help prevent errors in data collection, please double check your spelling of the title and author.\n\n**NEW**: Would you like to ask the author you are reading (or just finished reading) a question? Type **!invite** in your comment and we will reach out to them to request they join us for a community Ask Me Anything event!\n\n-Your Friendly /r/books Moderator Team",

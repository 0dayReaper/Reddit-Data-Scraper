GRRM makes it very clear there's a more important battle in the north with allusions to the white walkers and establishes a clear contrast between Yoren, for example, looking disgusting and practically a beggar before a court of rich nobles who only care about their immediate kingdoms, dismissing his requests for help. I'd say that's more the politics in general of this series reflecting the didactic message you perceived.\n\nIn many ways, more than just death, GRRM's writing successfully captures realism, which is why his story was such a unique phenomenon when released. No surprise it adapted so well to a TV series.",

The other characters hold him in the highest esteem imaginable, and you as the audience are left to piece together why that is. We know he was an honorable and skillful knight to the extreme. Barristan Selmy, arguably the greatest swordsman and most chivalrous knight during the time GoT takes place (when threatening to carve apart the remaining kingsguard 'like cake' this was apparently a realistic enough threat from the elderly Selmy to give everyone in the room pause) considers himself to fall short of Dayne as a man and as a warrior.\n\nNed Stark's own son can see through what would obviously be a biased perception that Dayne was far and away a more skilled fighter than his father when receiving a vision of their duel, which his father *won.* ('Duel' being a favorable term for 'Arthur Dayne tears the Stark forces several new assholes before dying.')\n\nAnyway, not to belabor the point, but Dayne is everyone *in-universe's* idea of a badass, much like Fett was. And, much like Fett, the promise of that reputation is never expanded, leaving it to you, the viewer, to piece together or imagine exactly what it was that Dayne/Fett did to deserve his reputation.)\n\nOberyn I think is more of the guy done in by hubris. I'm struggling to think of a corollary in Star Wars but let's say Qui-Gon Jinn. The skillful maverick who is, in plot terms, deemed expendable because of his lack of caution. The difference is that Oberyn has a very clear, step by step case of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory because of his unconventional nature. QGJ was simply outclassed by his opponent, while in the mechanics of the story, his death was acceptable and perhaps even foreseeable, because he was unorthodox and flirted with danger throughout the story.\n\n**EDIT** After reading my initial post on Boba, I saw it was /u/jerpyderpy who brought the Dayne-Fett connection up. So...thank you, jerpy.",

IE: Excessive confidence, especially as an affront to fate. \n\nI think that fits and is fair. Whatever Oberyn's intentions were, he took his focus off of a ludicrously dangerous foe who was still alive and in fact specifically left alive by Oberyn so the latter could extract a confession. He tempted fate *several* times. 1) In his equipment: light armor, no helmet, only a spear as a weapon. 2) In his preparation: he was drinking before the fight. And 3) In his attitude: He did not respect the danger Clegane posed and was more concerned with his confession and calling out Tywin than making sure Clegane actually died. That's hubris, and it was that last one that officially did him in.\n\n",

The execution of Ned stark absolutely blew my mind.  Because up until then the book read like an especially naughty generic fantasy plot.  You have CLEAR protagonist and his noble and righteous family, gifted with these special dire wolves.  And you have some clearly evil antagonists, as well as the looming threat of the white walkers.\n\nI knew exactly where the books were going.  Ned and his family defeat their rivals and unite the realm, reconcile with the dragon princess and combine forces to defeat the true enemy.  The End.\n\nNed Stark's head rolling down the stairs really turned all of that on end, and made me very excited to see where the book would go.  I think Martin is just trying to avoid the trap that most fiction writers fall into in thinking, \"wouldn't it be cool if THIS happened?\" And then they write a story leading to that point.  Like, I don't think he wrote the whole story with this image in mind of Jon, Dany, And Tyrion flying on the backs of dragons cooking the white walkers and saving the world, and is filling in the story to get us to that scene.  Instead, he's doing his best to build a world, and characters within that world and trying to do it in such a way that their future is almost out of his control.\n\nI don't think anybody has \"plot armor.\"  Some people just have characteristics that allow them to survive almost any circumstance.",

The death of a character should always be within the realm of possibility, but the author or creator has the opportunity to show the story of someone throughout an entire world conflict. If everyone in Rick's group died in The Walking Dead, the world would still be inhabited by survivors. Then you could ask yourself, \"what was their entire story\"? Someone gets to last longer, why not tell their story from the beginningv",

Targaeryan blood, and the exiled Targaeryan supporters who follow her for it. Seriously though, dragons.\n\nJon's plot armour: Very pretty hair, Qhorin Halfhand, Valyrian steel and Davos Seaworth.\n\nThe thing people usually forget before they decide to criticize a story for dressing it's characters in 'plot armour' is that it really needs to be dishonest or contrived to actually be plot armour. NPCs get their skulls crushed by one punch from Mr. BigBad, but the hero can just keep. on. fighting. despite being physically identical to those peasants. Plot armour. However, in Game of Thrones, the reasons these characters survive are usually not contrived at all. Dany has dragons. Tyrion is really fucking smart and *really* fucking rich. Jon ... okay Jon might be a character with some contrived plot armour, especially Davos' motivation for helping him get back to his feet. I still don't know what that was. But 1/3 is nowhere near as bad as you make it sound. \n\nWhen the reason for a character's continued existence is consistent with the rest of the story, that's not a situation you get to complain about plot armour.

Something that is often lost in the discussion of ASOIAF is that our story doesn't simply focus on the nobles in-universe. We are almost exclusively concerned with the Lords Paramount and their closest associates. \n\nSome sources have put the Westerosi population at 40m, and our story ultimately revolves around about 15 - 20 people. We're dealing with the 1% of the 1% when we talk about Starks, Lannisters, Tyrells, or Arryns. The Freys, Tullys, Martells, Tarlys, and Baratheons are extremely wealthy by all universe standards. \n\nJon was educated by a maester. He was taught to fight by a seasoned knight. His father was Warden of the North and no one, not even Stannis Baratheon, ever doubted his honor. Because of these initial attributes, he served as steward to the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, himself a former head of a Northern house, and received council from Maester Aemon, one of the oldest maesters in Westeros as well as one of the few remaining Targaryens. \n\nJon was *bred* to lead and fight like almost no one in ASOIAF before him.",

As a person who has a highly demanding father who preaches about the \"right thing\" all  the time I definitely felt what Quentyn was going through during that boat ride to Meereen.

Tolkien made the whole \"Elf/Man/Dwarf/Halfling/Wizard\" fantasy party into a thing. Tolkien made a journey that was epic as hell, and of course it ended with a happy ending. But hey, back then, he was treading new ground.  \n  \nNowadays, if we read a new book about an elf and a man and a dwarf and a wizard going on a happily-ever-after fantasy adventure, it's worn out and cliche, and that's where authors like GRRM come in and make bold moves such as relentlessly killing off characters. Modern fiction is more dark and pessimistic than the more classical stuff. It's interesting to see storytelling evolve through the ages, and I wonder where it will go next.\n\nEDIT: This comment was extremely poorly worded. By \"modern fiction,\" I was thinking of \"stuff that has come out in the last couple of years\" and by \"classical fiction,\" I meant stuff that has dominated popular fiction in mainstream media for the last twenty to fifty years or so. So yeah, horrible word choice on my part. I'm well aware that a a lot of *actual* classical fiction is dark and tragic as fuck, arguably more so than anything we see today. ",

It's a crucial element to ASOIAF, for sure.  \n  \nBut I've always taken issue with GRRM's apparent sense of superiority for this decision. This in response to things like his \"quibble\" with Tolkien for not showing us Aragorn's tax policy, and his claim that not showing that heroes die in war is \"dishonest\".  \n  \nI'm pretty sure that Tolkien himself knows all too well that heroes die in war. It's just that it isn't necessary to explore this in every piece of fiction we create and consume. I understand feeling a sense of improvement to a story for making the death more real, but portraying the randomness of death is just one end among countless other ends to improve a story, which all have historical places in a genre literally called Fantasy.  \n  \nGRRM is mistaking what he loves to write with what people should be writing. And he believes he arrived at it to subvert traditional' fantasy that's way to concerned with fantasy. \n  \nSomeone else said it better than me. [Here's Tolkien rapping against Martin about the anarchy of death.](https://youtu.be/XAAp_luluo0?t=61)  \n  \n**edit: Disclaimer, I'm passionate about both LOTR AND ASOIAF. I don't take issue with GRRM's style, just with his sentiments. There's no reason to call the other side of the coin \"dishonest\" or to have a \"quibble\" with Tolkien.**  ",

            "comment": "All the main characters are still alive.  GRR Martin is telling a pretty typical fantasy story with pretty typical story arcs... The difference is that his style obscures who is essential.   Ned and Robb were never essential.  You could make this entire series into a 2 hour movie telling Jon's unlikely hero journey from unknown bastard to \"Prince who was Promised\", but it would be less interesting. In-fact, I believe movie studios pitched that exact idea to GRR Martin before HBO came along.  What makes Game of Thrones compelling is that it allows time to magnify secondary characters like Robb Stark that gives more context to Jons typical hero journey.   People mostly get confused by the method of telling the story.  For instance, I don't think Dany is essential to the conclusion of this story.  I would not at all be shocked if she was the last great \"shocking\" death.  She's served her purpose of re-introducing Dragons to the world - and if she died it would not impact Jon's end game.  Ultimately in a condensed movie versions, you'd have to quickly explain how Jon acquires Dragons for his final showdown with the white walkers, but it could be done without Dany.\n\nWith this season on the verge of confirming the longstanding R+L=J theory, and that theory essentially forming the backbone of this entire series (there's no other reason for us to be peaking into this specific pocket of time), I'm not going to be surprised unless Jon snow is officially killed off.  He's the Luke Skywalker of this story.  What makes Game of Thrones unique is that they give several secondary characters the same treatment.  People misinterpret GRR Martin as being \"random\", but that's precisely what makes it so original - that he has razzledazzled the audience so thoroughly that they can't distinguish the main character from an extra.  It would be like if Star Wars had been a 7 season TV show where you spent the first few seasons thinking Luke Skywalker was just some random recruit to the rebellion and the main character was one of the random imperial officers who was force-choked to death by Vader midway through the third season.\n\n**TL;DR:  Game of Thrones is unique, because GRR Martin gives secondary characters the same attention as those core to the story.  It would be like if the original Star Wars movies were a 7 season HBO Show where you spent the first 3 seasons thinking [Biggs Darklighter](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Biggs_Darklighter) was the key hero on the show.  His death at the Battle of Yavin would break alt-universe Twitter.**",

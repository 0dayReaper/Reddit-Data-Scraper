    "postText": "I went to buy a book today (in Canada) and I was shocked to find it advertised at $32.99 for a paperback (history). Right next to it on the shelf, was a book I also own at home and bought in 2016 - for $22.00. That same book is now $31.99 and the pages are of horrendous quality, blurry type, and the photo pages are now on regular paper instead of photo paper. \n\nAll books by this author in the series of World War Two history books were of the same problem. All published through Penguin. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s my naivety but what\u2019s going on here? We all know about supply chain issues, cost of energy and paper etc. I don\u2019t mind paying slightly more for something. But when the pages are basically like tracing paper now, with blurry type and the price has also increased - I start to feel a little ripped off.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts on this?",

    "postText": "I've been bouncing off a lot of media lately, not just books. Podcasts, video games, books, you name it (well, mostly just those three). And I was starting to think it was a problem with me. I have moments like that, when nothing seems interesting and I feel like I'm spiraling out of control and I'm jumping from distraction to distraction to try and quiet my mind for a minute.\n\nI've been reading The Shipping News, listening to a podcast about the Stonewall Riots, as well as a dramatic fiction podcast. The first two feel like a chore, and the last one is good, but I also can't listen to more than one episode in a row. So I find myself unsure of what to do or read next when I need a break.\n\nImagine my relief then when I downloaded Paladin's Grace off a recommendation from someone on r/cozyfantasy and immediately got drawn in. No distractions, no wondering if I should be doing something else, just enjoying the story unfold and the character's dialog and antics. Instead of feeling like this thing I have to do to expand my horizons or educate myself, I'm just reading and enjoying it. It's nice to know that my attention span isn't wrecked or that I'm stressing out to the point where I can't just enjoy a simple story.\n\nIt's good to explore outside your comfort zone, but it's also good to just read something you like without worrying if it's making you a better person. Thanks for reading.",

Her response was something along the lines of \"oh yeah, I guess I just really liked that one\" and your post made me think about how many people out there think they are \"bad readers\" or \"slow readers\" like this kid when really they're just used to reading material that doesn't interest them",

Even if one enjoys complex works of literature or nonfiction tomes to learn about a variety of topics, sometimes you just need a break and read something for enjoyment. There is nothing wrong with that!\n\nIt also might depend on what else is going on in your life. If your job is hectic or there are other stressors it can be difficult to read something more challenging.",

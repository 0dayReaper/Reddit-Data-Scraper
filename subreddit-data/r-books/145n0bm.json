    "postText": "I just read my first book of hers- And Then There Were None.  I read mostly classic fiction and am not a big fan of most contemporary fiction.  To be honest there was not a lot of complexity to the plot.  I knew that there were 9 or 10 people on an island that were going to lose their lives one by one, and actually all of them (the title).  The book also lacked character development.  It seems the author made the biggest effort in the mystery of who the actual killer was.    \n\n\nThere was nothing witty or funny about the writing, nor is Christie a wordy, descriptive writer like Dickens.  I'm not necessarily comparing here to Dickens because he is a different era and a different genre.  I figured out who the killer was when the book was about 3/4 finished due to a certain clue.   I do like trying new writers, but I did not get anything out of this.  I have another book of hers in my shopping cart, but I'm taking it out.",

David Suchet was absolutely flawless as Poirot.\n\nCrooked House is one of my favorite novel of hers that's not a Poirot novel. I also enjoy her spy/adventure books like The Man in the Brown Suit. I especially LOVE Tommy and Tuppence's The Secret Adversary. The setting, the intrigue, the characters!\n\nI forgot to add that yes, she's no literary genius. Her books are just fun \"beach reading\" type books. If you like historical mystery I'd suggest the entire Sebastian St Cyr series or The Alienist by Caleb Carr.",

            "comment": "When Christie wrote \"And Then There Were None,\" there was nothing remotely like it in all of literary history. Nothing.   \n\n\nChristie spent a long time working out the plot and characters, giving each a backstory, and tying each death to the \"little,\" uh...let's say \"soldiers\" children's poem. She really worked it over to be as carefully plotted as possible. She did a fine job.  \n\n\nChristie was very much against wasting time on character development that doesn't serve the plot in some way -- either to provide a motive that will explain something at the end, or to create a plausible red-herring distraction to throw you off the trail. So yes, the book is pretty dry. It's meant to be.   \n\n\nIf you are looking for laughs or wit, Christie tried to work those into the Poirot mysteries somewhat, usually with little bits of business about Poirot's ego and fastidiousness. Usually she keeps that pretty restrained too.\n\nI can only guess how you figured out the solution 3/4 of the way through. Perhaps something to do with a \"red herring\"? The first time I read it, I was young and had no idea what to expect from the book, and didn't have my guard up about little tricks and suspicions. I was genuinely perplexed and then amused by the solution. It sucks being a little more attentive and jaded now -- I don't get to have that same \"aha!\" feeling as often.\n\nBut you should still read Christie books, at least some. Even if you're jaded. Enjoy them for the craftiness and for her earnest attempt to keep outdoing herself, keep the audience one step behind, etc. The thing about Christie is she almost always plays fair, in the sense that she gives the reader enough to work with that a really attentive reader could figure out the solution, but is usually juuusssst behind the curve of where the detective (Poirot, Marple, the Tuppences) is.\n\nShe wrote 80 or so books. I think maybe 65-ish are novels, the others story anthologies? Out of those 65, there are probably about 20 that are really really good, and 25-30 decent middle-level ones, and 15 skip-'ems.\n\nThe really good ones include The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, The ABC Murders, Death on the Nile, Curtain, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Crooked House, Poirot's Christmas, Pale Horse, Evil Under the Sun, And Then There Were None, Murder on the Orient Express, The Body in the Library, and likely several I'm forgetting.\n\nThe best thing to do is read them before anybody tells you the ending, or before you're exposed to the ending from watching a movie version. It's so much more fun to find out on your own, and test your wits against Christie's (often hidden) clues.\n\nOne middle-level book that I like a lot is Cards on the Table. It's very different in that there are only 4 suspects, and they're all playing a bridge game. The murder is solved by analyzing each player's style of card playing. \n\nChristie reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock in that she was always trying to find new approaches to what she was doing. She kept doing a lot of the same stuff, but she also kept trying to enliven and enhance it, find new tricks and settings and set-ups, etc. Also, almost all of her works are accessible and you can enjoy them in a short time period.\n\nIf you don't ever read another Christie book, not a big deal. Maybe the mystery genre is not for you, or maybe you'd like some other writer with a different style.",

There are a few child victims in her books, and they are particularly nasty characters.\n\nTherefore, character development isn't part of the plot. ATTWN is a good example, because &gt;!everyone has committed a crime and they are all justifying it to themselves without any sense of guilt. The best example of this is Vera who is horrified at Emily (?) for driving a vulnerable young woman to suicide, but Vera doesn't have the same horror at her own crime which was premeditated. Vera is simply heartbroken that her crime didn't get the right result. !&lt;\n\nNot sure if I needed a spoiler alert there, because I'm only referring to the opening chapters, but I don't want to spoil the first-time experience for anyone who hasn't read it!",

She usually uses fair play rules so you can try and solve the mystery. I read Murder on the Orient Express first and personally wasn't impressed, but I was expecting Sherlock Holmes, which it is completely different from. I've enjoyed Crooked House, ABC Murders, and 5 Little Pigs the most, and her Miss Marpe books (Murder at the Vicarage) are good too. She also has straight adventure novels with Tommy and Tuppence too.",

I perfectly understand OP not liking them if that\u2019s not their thing. But it\u2019s a not a \u201cclassic vs contemporary fiction, especially since \u201cclassic fiction\u201d is a big umbrella that covers a lot of eras and styles and books that survived for various reasons, including \u201cnot a ton of literary merit, but a really good story.\u201d",

I think one issue is that so, so many authors have reworked her plots (seriously, I\u2019ve read at least 5 thinly veiled reworkings of And Then There Were None). It can be difficult to appreciate what a terrific storyteller she was. Furthermore, she helped develop and adhered to the rules of golden age detective writing, which have largely fallen by the wayside (especially the reliable narrator).",

    "postText": "I enjoyed reading this book. I like how the main character, Jake, was extremely unlikeable lol. I picked up bad vibes from &gt;!Anna!&lt; right away, I knew she had something to do with it! Then I started thinking she was the niece, but as soon as **Crib** had the twist of &gt;!Samantha killing her daughter and living as Maria, it was so obvious it was about Anna.!&lt;\n\nThe more I read the book, the more it reminded me of something, then finally it clicked. *Written in Blood,* S1E2 (aired in 1998) from **Midsomer Murders:** *After a noted author speaks before a group of local writers, the naked body of the host is found bludgeoned to death in his home.*\n\nIt's been several years since I watched the episode, but basically you find out that the murdered man lived a \"scandalous\" life, starting as a boy. When he grew up, he told that story to someone (I think a psychologist?) and that person wrote that story of that man's childhood as fiction. If it's the same episode I'm thinking about, there is also an evil sister lol.\n\nBut I still thought it was a fun book and would recommend it. Maybe get it from the library rather than buying it. It would make a fabulous movie or miniseries!",

(I don't love thrillers where it's *all* obvious, but when I can't guess anything, it seems like the author did not lay enough groundwork either...so this was a happy medium in my book!)",

    "postText": "I just finished this book and I very much enjoyed it, more so than Gatsby to be honest. It definitely earned a place in my top 5.\n\nI like to browser reddit when I finish a book to see what others think, and I was very surprised to see how many people disliked it. A common complaint seemed to be that it flat out wasnt interesting, or that it had an anticlimactic ending. But I honestly thought the ending was my favorite part. I thought it was very fitting for Dick to sort or fade away into obscurity and mediocrity and that this was the greatest tragedy that could befall a character like him. The whole book left me feeling very melancholy and I kinda want to read it again. People say that the characters were one dimensional but I thought they had some complexity to them. \n\nA lot of people say you need to consider Fitzgeralds personal life to really appreciate it. While I agree this adds a lot to it and its interesting to see him bleed into the character, i thought that the book was able tk stand on its own two feet and got a lot of thought/emotion out of me.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Sorry for the super surface level commentary. Im on my 15 min break and plus im an idiot lol.",

            "comment": "It's been a long time since I read it but I remember being very impressed. I've read all of Fitzgerald's novels (and what I think is a comprehensive collection of short stories). Personally, I'd rank it as his second best novel after The Great Gatsby, though it's not uncommon to hear people rank it first (including Hemingway, iirc). The fade into mediocrity is the point of the book in my opinion and I can't imagine it ending otherwise. Most of the book is the slow beginnings of that fade, if I remember correctly. It reminds me of Almayer's Folly by Joseph Conrad, in that regard.",

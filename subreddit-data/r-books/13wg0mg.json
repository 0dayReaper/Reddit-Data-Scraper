If you have specific tastes, it's increasingly difficult to find things you like. People seem to retreat to smaller, like-minded groups.",

It sounds like the author is tired of a very specific (and very common) type of poetry. [Perhaps there's a lack of variety online](https://www.boredpanda.com/instagram-identical-photos/). Perhaps a social media algorithm keeps recommending the wrong things. There's nothing wrong with being tired of something. Actually, the article sounds like typical venting.\n\nSo the question remains: how do you find what you like? How do you find new things?",

That\u2019s always been the case. As a result we often see many very similar, or occasionally nearly identical, works. It can be tiresome, but it\u2019s not really troubling. More people are engaging in creative pursuits than at any point in human history. That\u2019s a good thing.  \n\nI think there\u2019s lots of variety, but the volume of work is so high, sorting though to find what you like, as you said, can be difficult. \n\nThe easiest way is to find people who value similar qualities, and exchange recommendations. \n\nOr, something I do frequently, take artists you already like, and trace the lineage of their influences. You\u2019d be shocked how many authors and artists will correspond with you about the artists that inspired them. \n\nI like to then look at other artists or authors considered to be of the same movements, or who moved in similar artistic circles, and repeat. \n\nI\u2019ve discovered broad and engaging artistic \u201cgenealogies\u201d that both discovered others in the styles I already enjoyed, and introduced me to new work I\u2019d never have discovered otherwise.",

Is it even bad? \n\nIm no poet, but I am an artist, and I can very much empathize with the feeling of putting hours of work into crafting something with meaning imbued in it, only for a hastily whipped up so called \"bad\" piece of art (or perhaps a quickly drawn picture of a Pokemon or something) to utterly eclipse my art in terms of engagement. \n\n...but I mean. *Is it* bad art that \"beat\" my own? Just because somethings done quicker, with less effort, does that make it lesser? I see many are quick to make the assumption that more effort=more quality, but I dont think its really ever that simple, much less with something as subjective as art of all things. If a viewer gets more enjoyment engaging with a cute Pikachu drawing, or a cheesy post breakup facebook poem, why is that lesser than whatever I made? Every piece of art has 2 facets, one that the artist imbued it with, and 1 that the viewer engages with. If the viewer gets more out of something \"cheap\", is that really so bad? I dont think it is. And by extension, at least some part of that \"bad\" art isnt so bad after all. Somethings accomplished by its existence, self expression is made or had, and the viewer is enriched, if at least a little.\n\nWhether art can be objectively good or bad isnt even attempted to be justified, yet spoken about as if its a known quantity. This is something philosophers have debated about over millenia, and im not comfortable with some stuffy article dolling it out as if theyre an authority on the matter, to demean what others make or enjoy. \n\nTheres also another conversation to be had about how modern media has us really overly consumed with engagemenr and has us conflating it with quality (an inverse of my example-- just because my piece gets little to no engagement, I dont think that renders my piece as necessarily bad), but thats another can of worms. \n\nTl;dr, I think its worth questioning what, if any art, is bad to begin with.",

He doesn't know which is which. \n\nI majored in Fine Art and English and took several poetry workshops as electives. My first class I wrote shit. The last day of that first class I turned in some pretty respectable work. It just takes some interest and immersion. And reading a lot of good work, guided by a talented poet, is everything. \n\nIt pisses me off that we Americans aren't more carefully educated to appreciate excellent art.

We should be taught that and critical thinking skills at minimum.\n\nThere seems like there are no rules in abstract painting, but there is a difference between a shitty abstract painting and a really good one. \n\nFrom my POV, there is an objective difference between good art and shitty art, learning and ignorance. \n\nAdmittedly, that's mostly because I have been educated from the point of view of experts in those fields.

Why hold art to a different standard?\n\nWell that's the thing -- I don't hold it to a different standard. In fact, I hold it to the exact same standard.Let's say you and I both had the same meal, but one of us loved it, and the other hated it. Neither perspective is incorrect of course. But this also means that the meal cannot be objectively described as bad just because one of us disliked it.\n\nLiteral taste is subjective, as it is dependent on the filter of a mind to experience it. That meal has objective components - the mix of ingredients, how those ingredients may react on our tongues and stomaches at an atomic level, and what not - but how we respond to those objective elements will always have a subjective filter.\n\nIn that same sense, so does art. You or I are certainly free to place a personal judgement value, but ultimately how you or I react to a given piece of art is filtered through our minds. There is no universal objective measurement on the \"goodness\" or \"badness\" of art, intrinsic to the piece itself, in the same way that something like Math has objective value independent of a human conception. Art's inherently dependent on the viewer (and creator) to judge.\n\nYou can measure certain qualities of art. How certain colors blend together, the representation of form of composition. The grammatical accuracy of a sentence in a book, how a mechanic interacts with another in a video game, etc.. But ultimately how that impacts the viewer is up to the viewer. Even the most obtuse, unmoving, or unagreeable aspect CAN be interpreted differently by a viewer. There will always be a filter.\n\n&gt;\\&gt;It's much closer to the difference between your art and the third-grade level doodles I scrawl in the margins of my notebook. Even though the pokemon artist wasn't aiming to make high-brow art I still wouldn't call it bad. They worked for years to learn and improve technique and have an understanding of the craft.\n\nTo be honest, I used a really poor example for my argument. I was actually (somewhat dishonestly) recalling an experience *where I myself* created both pieces in question, and that the Pokemon art, which I know for a fact was devoid of much thought or consideration, exploded in popularity to the point where its still a popular item on Google image search almost 2 decades later. I can tell you for certainty as it's creator that it wasn't something that had value, meaning, etc.. put into it. I mainly brought it up to show I can empathize directly with the feeling of something \"good\" so-to-speak was thoroughly outdone by something \"bad\" so-to-speak.\n\nBut let's ditch that analogy, and just stick with yours, since it still applies. Let's compare the Mona Lisa to a literal toddler's doodle of their mother. It's perfectly applicable, and quite a relevant example actually: Under virtually everyone's personal perspective, they would deem the Mona Lisa to be a \"greater\" piece of art than the toddler's drawings... but by what metric? The usual justification is, as you brought up, the history behind the piece, the honing of the craft, mastery of the skill, the immense effort that went into it, and in this particular case the impact on the art world that it's made. But to that mother, that toddler's drawing could very well be the most precious drawing she owns, and thus be subjectively a much more moving piece to her than the Mona Lisa ever could be.\n\nFurthermore, dedication and effort, while in most cases praiseworthy, don't necesarily equate to quality, even under the laymans perspective. Lets use an extreme example: Let's say I spend 10 years of my life redrawing, and erasing the same picture over and over, and it is by most's view, quite ugly... does that make it good? I mean, that in itself is a contradiction, until you bring in subjective interpretations into the fold.\n\nSo if these subjective takes on art lack any objectivity, and can vary to the absolute extremes on both ends, where does the objective measurement start? There is none. Art is, at the very end point, inherently subjective in nature due to its dependence on individualistic perspective.\n\n&gt;\\&gt;But I don't think it's snobby to wish that better poets got more attention, or to be able to admit that some things are just bad.\n\nWell and to be clear, I don't think that's wrong at all. I question the terms of \"better\" and \"bad\", because the author's argument is predicated on that being the case, but speaking empathetically, I wish the very best for those who dont get the attention that they wish they had over the crafts that they labor over. That part I have no issues with.\n\nMy main issue comes from putting down even the most basic, entry-level works as \"bad\", when to be frank, no one agrees on whats bad quality or good quality to begin with.",

But I think we're at odds over what we mean when we say something is \"good\" art.\n\nTo me, my subjective personal taste is separate from the question of whether something is good or bad in an aesthetic sense. The food example you bring up is a good one. I recognize that boxed macaroni and cheese isn't \"good\" food, in the sense that it isn't prepared well or conceived with any particular demonstration of craft or artistry, but I still like it. Similarly, I wouldn't say that Thor 2 is a good movie in an aesthetic sense, but I would say I like watching it very much. I'm an expert in poetry; I like really formalist, rhyming verse. But I would never say that poetry has to look like that to be good!\n\nI think this example is also illustrative:\n\n&gt;The usual justification is, as you brought up, the history behind the piece, the honing of the craft, mastery of the skill, the immense effort that went into it, and in this particular case the impact on the art world that it's made. But to that mother, that toddler's drawing could very well be the most precious drawing she owns, and thus be subjectively a much more moving piece to her than the Mona Lisa ever could be.\n\nThe toddler's drawing is of course much more personally meaningful to her mother than the Mona Lisa. But how you feel about art is not the only way to evaluate it. There's no reason to throw out aesthetic evaluations and say that the only thing that matters is how it makes you feel. That mother might like her child's drawing better, but it's hard to imagine her seriously arguing that it's better than the Mona Lisa. That would be very silly.\n\n\"But,\" you might say, \"even an informed aesthetic evaluation of art is still subjective!\" Quite so! All opinions are. But society is not merely a collection of individuals, we can reach a broad consensus together about what qualifies as good or bad art. And in that way, we can have opinions that are slightly less subjective. And such a consensus can be transformed over time by new arguments, opinions and works of art\u2014just as the essay we are responding to is attempting to do. Are we so self-centered that we don't care to hear out other opinions because they're subjective? People have become hostile to criticism because they don\u2019t like being told what to think or do. But criticism is merely an argument that\u2019s trying to change your point of view and build a consensus about what kind of art we want to value and promote.\n\nMy point is, there's a middle ground between saying that we can conclusively and objectively determine what is good and bad in art for everyone, everywhere, at all times and\n\n&gt;\"Art is inherently subjective in nature due to its dependence on individualistic perspective.\"\n\nI reject that out of hand. Art is about making connections with other people across time and space. It is the very opposite of individualistic. It is social and subject to the evaluation of society. I don't mean to devalue affective or personal responses to art, but I think we should evaluate art from multiple different perspectives.",

I'm sitting here, reading this, genuinely debating on whether I agree with what you said or not, and not just rejecting it because we've taken different stances. Really good reply.   \n\n\nSo first off, I think you're definitely right about us being at odds about where we define art.   \n\n\nStill, I think I disagree ultimately. And it comes back to \"Art is inherently subjective in nature due to its dependence on individualistic perspective.\"  \n\n\n&gt;I reject that out of hand. Art is about making connections with other people across time and space. It is the very opposite of individualistic. It is social and subject to the evaluation of society. I don't mean to devalue affective or personal responses to art, but I think we should evaluate art from multiple different perspectives.\n\n... and the reason I disagree, comes to a sort of Schopenhauer-like discussion.   \nI initially wanted to say that \"I agree that art is social, but not intrinsically in the same way that morality is, but rather as a manifestation of our social nature applying itself to what we do\".. But I'll admit, I'm not so sure I agree with what I was going to say. Art is, after all, an expression of oneself. But could expression meaningfully exist without someone to witness the expression? For the sake of argument, let's pretend I was the only person alive, yet miraculously blind, and I spent my days painting pictures.. would it even be able to be called art, if no one (not even myself) could observe it? Would it not just be splatters of pigment that lost its meaning as soon as it lost anyone to know what it looked like? I don't know that I'd say yes, but I don't know that I'd say no either... I think, regardless of the answer, as usual *the definition of art here is lacking.*   \n\n\n***But***, even if we may not be alone physically like the above example, we are alone mentally. In that, we are in a sort of \"mental prison\" in a sense. That same filter of the mind that I spoke about earlier, applies to everything our individual existences can know.  Some things we can reason to exist outside of ourselves (again, using Math as an example-- 1+1 will always equal 2, regardless of if a human observer exists to do that math), but other experiences are ultimately trapped in the perspective of anothers. So long as we have separate minds, I could never experience your life exactly as you have. So while art, at least practically, is very social, it's social-ness is dependent on isolated minds.   \n\n\n  \nYour definition seems to rely on consensus of those isolated minds. But, consensus is fickle.   \n\n\nLet's say we had a piece that, literally everyone alive genuinely agreed was absolutely beautiful today. Under your social perspective of art that you outlined, we could say that this piece is imbued with objective aesthetic \"goodness\". But, let's assume that next year, everyone alive genuinely changed their collective opinions and believed it was horrible. In other words, that piece is now imbued with a collective objective aesthetic \"badness\".   \n\n\nIt's obviously an impractically extreme example, but the fact that it COULD happen illustrates that the art piece still has no divine objective aesthetic quality. Nothing changed about the art, we did, and that it is ultimately reliant on our subjective perspective. **We can find commonalities amongst ourselves about** ***what*** **exactly we agree on or find aesthetically pleasing, but I believe doing so is finding a description of ourselves more than the description of the piece of art the subject may be about.** \n\n  \n\n\nThere are further discussions here, like how disagreement in appraisal brings up some serious questions (For example, using OP's Author's example, if consensus is important for appraisal, and consensus prefers Facebook poetry with empty platitudes, couldnt we flip the script on traditional expertise thoughts, and call the \"good\" poetry bad?), but the above is ultimately my main point.",

I don't want to further tax your time and attention, but based on your response (and a question posed by u/pornplz22526) there seems to be a bit of a misreading of what I wrote previously. I did not mean that through consensus we arrive at a truly objective reality about what is \"good.\" I meant that we reach toward something very slightly closer to resembling objectivity in its capacity to ground our views in something external to our own minds. In my worldview there is nothing in the universe external to human society that determines what is beautiful or good in a truly objective sense. The universe does not care about beauty; there is no realm of perfect platonic forms we're drawing ideas from.\n\nAesthetics is a set of ideas and values developed by people. It is an inherently subjective point of view. There have been countless different philosophies of aesthetics throughout history and there are countless different aesthetic values that have currency in a society at any given moment.\n\nWhat I'm really trying to argue is that just because it's not objectively correct, doesn't mean it's wrong for society (or a subset of society) to come together and decide that we value x, y, and z in art because that speaks to who we are. But we can't do that in the first place if we all believe we have no right to participate in the conversation just because objective aesthetics don't exist.\n\nAnd sure, tastes change. New philosophies emerge. New art styles emerge. When Wordsworth and Coleridge published *Lyrical Ballads,* they were very consciously running against what the prevailing aesthetics of poetry in the 18th century had been. But as Wordsworth wrote:\n\n&gt;...every great and original writer, in proportion as he is great and original, must himself create taste by which he is to be relished.\n\nThe Romantic poets developed an entire new aesthetics of what good poetry even meant. If we're too afraid to believe some things are bad and some things are good how can we make art at all? I don't think we need to decide what's good in art across all differences of culture and time. But again that doesn't mean we shouldn't discuss what's good to us right now.\n\nI do find it interesting that even despite wild differences of aesthetic values truly great art has a way of enduring. Renaissance-style portraiture is not really anyone's idea of a good painting anymore; but we all agree there's \\*something\\* about the Mona Lisa. Did Da Vinci stumble into objective \"goodness?\" Probably not. More likely he created art that speaks in a compelling way to something fundamentally enduring about people. If I were going to make an aesthetics of what is \"good,\" I'd probably start there!",

I try to be really supportive of people in my personal life because it\u2019s good for everyone involved. Of course, if it\u2019s an area where criticism is important (like if someone\u2019s genuinely looking to improve at something or if someone\u2019s engaging in harmful behavior), that\u2019s different.\n\nI think we agree that unearned positivity can be obnoxious. But the important thing to remember here is that you get to choose how to feel about something. When my nine-year-old niece shows me a story she drew, I\u2019m always incredibly proud of her and tell her how much I love her story. It would be incredibly inappropriate to start pointing out all the flaws and ways she can improve her writing because that\u2019s not the point.\n\nIf you\u2019re hanging out with friends (IRL or internet people) and you\u2019re being supportive, then you can choose to find genuine praise for whatever they produce.

Lots of 9 year olds still believe in Santa. They literally need a parent in order to teach them how to develop properly, and that can include telling them they're good when compared to an adult or even other children they aren't. That doesn't mean we should treat adults like children by lying to them about how good they are. Besides, it's important to recognize that even if you are bad at something, that's okay. It's a bit harder for children to understand that one. But it's important not to reinforce the notion that if someone is bad at something, they should feel bad about it, and always telling everyone they're good at something no matter if they are or not can reinforce that notion.\n\nLike if you want to play soccer in your free time, that's all well and good, but it might be a bit unhealthy if it gets to the point where major league soccer players aren't good but everyone thinks they are because the average audience have all told each other that being good is just about having fun rather than scoring points or whatever.\n\n&gt;If you\u2019re hanging out with friends (IRL or internet people) and you\u2019re being supportive, then you can choose to find genuine praise for whatever they produce.

By alluding to older poems, you can contrast the usage of specific words between the two poems, and the way the author has changed or recontextualized the word becomes meaningful and significant.\n\nAs this article states, most instagram poetry is created in a vacuum; distinctly devoid of intertextuality or poetic tradition of its own.

However, there is no doubt that toddler art takes FAR less skill to produce that any painting by any master.  \n\nAdditionally, it's easy to show that the impact of a painting by a master is going to have far greater appeal and impact on the public than a toddler painting.  \n\nNo citations provided; sorry.  :)  But we only have to point to history to show this is true.  Toddlers have produced art for as long as humans could draw.  We have painted for almost as long.  Which ones are more \"successful\" or have endured for any length of time?

They are objectively going to make better art. Not better because everyone will like it, but better because they have experience and the art itself is a series of deliberate choices.\n\nThe same goes for poetry, novels, movies, etc.",

What pieces/authors does it respond to? What lineage is it drawing from? What does it add to the canon that's new or fresh or unique or interesting? \n\nMost insta-poetry doesn't really add anything new and it's obvious those writers haven't widely read the poetry that's come before them for millennia. So that's what makes it \"bad\" (but if you enjoy it then you enjoy it! And there's nothing wrong with that)",

But that\u2019s hardly a poem. It\u2019s not even clever. Maybe I\u2019ll go looking around Instagram for real examples because it\u2019s pretty fun. \n\nAnyway, a lot of the works that people dislike or call bad aren\u2019t even \u201cbad\u201d necessarily, but super overrated. They\u2019re often really superficial and lack any deeper meaning or room for analysis. \n\nAre they using the shape of the words to be interesting? Poetry is a visual form as well if you want it to be. How are the lines spaced? Do you use enjambment? Are you using or not using it on purpose, or are you choosing what is easiest?\n\nI\u2019m on my phone and not at all prepared for a huge discussion but that\u2019s generally what I think of.\n\nThe biggest takeaway is that lots of stuff isn\u2019t bad but overrated and gets way too much attention for the actual quality. Accessibility in art is still very important, to be sure. It\u2019s just annoying when people who kinda suck are getting more acclaim than people working their asses off",

Yes, I do believe the great poets have more to say than some page that has snippets like, \"You were better than the ones  whose love you craved, now only for those who are worthy your love is saved\" or something like that. It's just not the same thing and it's so annoying to see it paraded as if it is.",

Musicians now have access to tools wildly, wildly beyond anything before in history. The ability to listen, on repeat, to any musician in recorded history, or hell to listen to yourself on repeat after practicing does so much for improving your craft. You're backed up by all of the publications and study of history, and the argument of \"musicians aren't as good as they used to be\" just doesn't hold water. Opportunities now are beyond the imagination of the musicians who premiered most of the operatic literature.  \n\n\nRaw drive is important, a skilled teacher is important, but opportunity, talent, environment, and inspiration can make up for a shortcoming in another area. Look at how many great compositions and performances come early in a musicians career, when if drive and focus were all that mattered should have only gotten better as they developed.  There is a spark that can't be quantified.",

Context matters. Duchamp\u2019s *Fountain* and Beckett\u2019s *Waiting for Godot* can truly subvert expectations and make is question what art is. The difference, I think, is that both those artists have spent time contemplating the potential downsides and blind spots of their industry and tried to find the best way to show that and make lay people understand them.

People are completely fine saying that \"The Room\" is a bad movie. No one is gonna hop on their \"People like what they like\" horse and try to act like it's high art. And that applies to certain books too. A lot of people love Twilight, but Twilight fans laugh at how creepy and wacky it gets. These fans understand what they love is not the peak of the artform and that's fine.\n\nHowever, poetry is more abstract and not often taught as in depth. It creates such a widening gap between good poetry and bad poetry. Now if you spout random pseudo-intellectualism, plagiarized proverbs, or horribly simple break-up advice you suddenly capture Instagram by storm. People love it because they think that's what poetry is meant to be. Then they prop it up to NY Times Bestsellers lists. \n\nAnd because poetry is seen as so abstract and \"just from the heart\" you become public enemy #1 if you criticize it. The people that write this half-baked unrefined poetry are going off pure emotion. They aren't considering the history of poetry or the forms of poetry. And no one is really saying \"Hey that's not that good you can do better.\" \n\nIdk. I don't want to keep people from liking what they like. Nor am I an expert on poetry or something. It's just very clear that poetry used to have a large cultural sway. It used to help lead whole art movements. Now it's that thing youtubers do to sound like Rupi Kaur. It all says exactly what it is and how to think instead of making people think. We can do better. It's okay to criticize art sometimes.",

It's the numbness that flows out of aesthetically pleasing words.   \n\n\nPoetry, like all art, has no true purpose. People make art to express themselves, or to experiment and research, or any other reason. There is also art that's made to be beautiful. In the simpelest of ways. Damien Hirst or Jeff Koons are perfect examples of this, and so Rupi Kaur too.  \n\n\nThe art is simple and pretty. She uses only aesthetic words and subjects. Insecurity, love, parental feelings. These are your live love laugh subjects and words. And so also Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst use big objects! It has to be shiny and round! Or maybe there are loads of diamonds! Pretty bright colors! Just something that is impressive on a very primal level.  \n\n\nBut this is the part where the article makes some sort of a point. This type of art. This Rupi Kaur art. This live love laugh poetry is not perse bad poetry. But it's poetry that's only about you. When you like and read this poetry. You read it because you want to soothe yourself. You read it because you want to feel pretty feelings. Jeff Koons actually plays with this at one point, his famous giant baloon dogs made of metal have become reflective. It's about you. You wanna look at pretty things.  \n\n\nYou don't care about the artist. You don't care about different opinions. You don't want to learn or explore. You don't want to see the nuance and the depth of what life has to offer. The difficulties. The people that like this don't want to read a poem that's about suicidal thoughts. Or some painting of an ugly goat in a pile of mud or whatever. It needs to be pretty with pretty colors and deep sounding words.   \n\n\nI guess this is fine. We can't all be 24/7 confronted with our harsh realities.  It's just that poetry carries a certain mysticism. It's and incredible old art form. The weird part about this simple aesthetic poetry is that it's hard to pinpoint the intention of the creator. Is it just a more immature mind discovering the art form for itself? Is it a company trying to make money out of generated content? Is it somebody who just wants to get attention by making something others will like?   \n\n\nThese are questions you can ask yourself as an experiment. What do you think the intention of the author was? Does it matter what their intention was? What is my intention with reading this? Am i curious of something new? Do i want to be acknowledged in what i already feel? Do i just want a cathartic experience?  \n\n\nLove ya'll bye :D",

A syllable with a long vowel like *ba:* has two moras (or morae).  A syllable with a vowel and a consonant at the end (like *bat*) has two moras.\n\nThe *kana* writing system represents moras nearly exactly. The word *O\u0304saka*, which in English has three syllables, has four moras in Japanese, because the /o/  vowel is long.  It is thus written with four symbols O-o-sa-ka, \u304a\u304a\u3055\u304b.A Japanese haiku has phrases of 5, 7, and 5 moras, rather than syllables, along with some other conventions.\n\nEnglish writing does not distinguish moras, and moras do not feature heavily in English grammar, much less poetry. So when adopting the haiku style, poets went with the syllable, which is an important unit in both.",

You just need to be able to speak your language.

The kind of poetry the article is talking about is no exception, but there is something there I think the article missed.\n\nNamely that its the style of poetry thats popular and not necessarily any of the specific poems themselves. \n\nAnd that tracks, to be frank, with the greater zeitgeist of how popular media is consumed. When zombies became a trend, the vast bulk of the entries in that genre were not individually popular, and among the ones that were, it was still more of a situation of \"this concept is popular\" and not \"this show/movie/game\" is popular. \n\nAnd it's probably also worthwhile to note that the nature of popularity had changed too. Engagement, good or bad, is a lot more important than it used to be, and this article is just evidence that these kinds of poetry are succeeding at driving engagement.",

Are you assuming that young women and girls are unable to be into art that isn't lowbrow schlock? Are you aware that plenty of young women and girls have refined tastes and deep knowledge of a variety of art forms and completely reject the type of commercial instagram fodder the article brings up? Why do we need to protect young women and girls' tastes from being judged just like everybody elses is? The article gives good arguments for why this type of poetry is bad and it has nothing to do with the reader's identity and everything to do with the craft of the poet.",

It's also not exactly surprising that the meme format poem is more widespread, it's just inherently more shareable. \n\nIf you want to delve into poetry deeper than the easiest to share format though you kinda hit a wall, where are you supposed to find good poetry? Most tastemakers for poetry have bad taste, and as a whole are way worse than people doing similar work for novels, film, and theater. I think a lot of it stems from the type of people who have the connections to even attempt to be an art tastemaker are of course already at a disadvantage for finding the best art",

            "comment": "I wrote an entire long comment about this article elsewhere. The gist is that I think the article would benefit from a longer perspective that considered popular poetry across time and what, if anything, makes this poetry different. \n\nThe first two paragraphs set up a false binary between a traditional and (post)modern way of reading poetry. In the first, we appreciate depths, meanings, and subtext; in the second, we appreciate \"shitty maudlin\" verse. No attention is given to the fact that the most often publicized poetry in the 16th through the 18th century was on broadsides and would have certainly qualified as doggerel or \"shitty\" verse. (Think ballads, often salacious. Curious? See Wikipedia or the UCSB archive.) There was also a vast amount of occasional verse circulating between people in local communities, as increased literacy led to an earlier \"democratization\" of verse. Most verse wasn't written by the likes of John Donne, Anne Bradstreet, or William Wordsworth but by anonymous broadside authors and ho-hum epistolaries. Also, while earlier readers certainly had a vocabulary to appreciate good poetry, valuing poetry for \"depth\" or \"subtext\" only really came to the fore with the New Critics in the 20th century. Criticism before that was often more centered on other qualities like \"brilliance\" or expression or moral refinement. Depth for depth's sake is relatively recent as a key aesthetic criterion.\n\nI do think there is a point in how the popular poetry right now is distinct, namely in valuing minimalism and plain language, accessible in quick reading. The older doggerel may have also been accessible, but minimalism in ephemera seems new. The unmetered, unrhymed line break has become a dominant mode, rather than the trimeter and tetrameter quatrains of yore. The best parts of the article at least gesture at this difference.\n\nBut, curiously, the only older art form the author reaches for is haiku, in a way that doesn't even recognize the larger situation of that tradition, the longer narratives of Basho that would then build in haiku as reflective puncta. There is very little other reflection for distinguishing why today's bad poetry is uniquely bad or uniquely a threat. There is no history of reading poetry reflected here, no nuance deeper than an interview soundbite about who might be served well or poorly by this poetry. As a result, the piece feels loaded to appeal only to those who are already opposed to the democratization of poetry, and it adds little new information or perspective.",

    "postText": "A review in bullet points:\n\n1. I thought it started off great, an amazing prologue and first half of the book that really drove the plot forward with new mysteries and kept me reading. Cronin is a very good writer.\n2. I guessed very early that &gt;!this was going to be a cryosleep/colony ship situation, with all the dreams about stars, and the Orianos being a very large boat, but the biggest tell being the sudden coldness the characters would feel. Now maybe Cronin wanted it to be easy to guess to make the reader feel smart, or maybe he's writing SF for a non-SF readership, I dunno.!&lt; That part didn't ruin my enjoyment of the book.\n3. My next point, I want to stress that I'm not one of those readers who requires a sympathetic protagonist, or the protagonist to be a good and defensible person. I like reading about jerks and terrible people. My issue is that Cronin seemed oblivious to the fact that these characters were assholes, especially Proctor. Let's get into him a bit:\n4. Proctor started off as a sympathetic and interesting character but ended up being &gt;!Elon Musk who let his daughter drown in a pool.!&lt;\n5. More on the asshole Proctor: &gt;!His explanation of how the society of Prospera was designed so that the colonists can get toughened up is while the investors rule as the Prosperans is absolute dogshit. Like I said, maybe Cronin was writing a great takedown of the tech plutocrat type and I just missed it, but my read is that Cronin wants the reader to think Procter is a good person.!&lt;\n6. Could Elise have been written any more as an awful, nagging wife? I was ready for her to put her hair in curlers and chase Proctor around with a rolling pin. \n7. The epilogue is absolutely hilarious. &gt;!Proctor's idea to discipline the colonists: make them indentured servants and treat them awful. Proctor's idea for disciplining the investors: make them teachers lol.!&lt;\n\nAlright that's it. I give it 3/5. Don't regret reading it but there you go.",

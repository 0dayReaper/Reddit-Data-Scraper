    "postText": "the book is the [first in a new fantasy series by rebecca yarros](https://www.rebeccayarros.com/books/fourth-wing/) and was released either april 5th or may 2nd ([I think may 2nd is correct](https://www.entangledpublishing.com/books/fourth-wing) but google sometimes reports the april date?). fourth wing is currently out of stock at every barnes and noble and walmart in my area, and checked out or on hold at every available library in two library networks near where I live, AND it is backordered on both amazon and bookshop dot org.\n\nmy question is: what's happening? is this just because it blew up on tiktok pretty suddenly or is there a publishing issue? or both?! the second in the series supposedly comes out on november 7th -- is the quick turnaround from first release to second contributing to the high demand? does this normally happen to new releases and I've just never noticed?\n\nI'm not that worried about getting it myself I just don't think I've seen a new release blow up so quickly like this? I would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nedit: another reason why I'm suprirsed is that emily henry's happy place was released in late april and has similarly blown up on tiktok but it's widely available? maybe because the hype was anticipated &amp; there's multiple editions so stock is good? idk but this is very interesting to me!",

            "comment": "I think it\u2019s just because of how popular it has been on booktok. I think I saw on the authors tiktok that it was chosen to launch the new fantasy romance imprint of the publisher so I imagine that really raised the marketing budget, but being a smaller publisher I think the demand has outreached the expected sales. \n\nI think Emily Henry is different because she was already a established and well loved author with the success of Book Lovers, People We Meet on Vacation and Beach Read so it was expected that Happy Place would sell incredibly well.",

It is available on ebook for sure, and there were actually copies on a bookstore in a non english speaking country.\n\nIt is number one on goodreads movers and shakers and it seems like its rating is unprecendented  4.70 avg rating \u2014 67,438 ratings and some of the people who love it seem really enthusiastic (I have not stealth unfriended anyone for it, because they calmed down but I did consider it).\n\nI read two chapters and mileage varies and all that but it is REALLY REALLY bad. I might even read more of it, though not right now, in a car crash looking way. But tons of people seem to love it fiercely, go figure. It will be an interesting litmus test for many years of what somebody's book taste is like.\n\nAlso, I read one Sarah J Maas book. Yarros writing makes Maas look like a prose stylist of the highest order (seriously).",

I'm unsure how someone could say after only reading 2 chapters of any book that a book is bad. Whether it's this book (which is almost 40 chapters) or one that's 15, it feels like a book isn't even given a chance at that point. The same goes for a TV show.",

Often you can tell from a paragraph!\n\nLet me see, the stupid dialogue and badass lines, the chaotic logic of previous training. The ridiculous scene of two women managing to do that very dangerous crossing with mismatched boots. The over the top villainy of that other guy on that crossing. Thr whole stupidity of thr system already inherent. \n\nThe writing itself. The cringing dialogue. \n\nThere was plenty there which made me roll my eyes and it was clear the authors writing was not to my taste nor her perspective on worldbuilding. Why the fuck should I waste money getting thr book and then inflicting on myself reading it? Mind you, it would make for a very popular hate read review for sure, but I do not do that on purpose. Neither did I rate it, or review it as if I had read. I read two chapters, I comment on those.",

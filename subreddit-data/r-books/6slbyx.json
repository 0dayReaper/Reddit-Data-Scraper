Your quote comes from the beginning of the lawsuit, I think to show he was trying to speak for the show even before that deal was put in place.  [Here](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/03/reading-rainbow-20-in-the-works-according-to-host.html) is a 2010 article where he says Reading Rainbow 2.0 is coming when apparently he hadn't even contacted WNED about licensing yet.  \n\nThe actual lawsuit is [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3914510-Burton.html), but the gist of it is that Burton and WNED entered into a licensing deal in 2011 in that he would build and manage a digital platform for reading rainbow and would be able to produce content for it.  WNED would remain in control of the TV rights and it was stipulated that Burton could not encroach into that space (aka, long form episodic videos).  Things seemed to have soured between them when WNED began developing a new Reading Rainbow and weren't interested in having him host.  He went to Netflix and began negotiating a new series without including WNED.  When he told them, they insisted on being in negotiations, but he refused and that's when they decided that he had broken the licensing agreement. \n\nThere are some other things they say he did, but those are the big ones.  So, essentially they are saying he broke the licensing agreement and to cease anything Reading Rainbow related and hand over the digital platform.  \n\nI don't think it's as cut and dried as everyone thinks and the article is clickbaity.\n\n\n\n",

When things were well on their way (apparently having even secured The Jim Henson Company's commitment to it) he brought the project to WNED hoping they'd see a maturing deal and agree to it.  It almost seems like it might have worked if he'd let them in on the final negotations, but I think he was concerned that if he did they may have insisted on a different host.  I think his hope was to bring them a finalized deal that was too good to pass up so they would be forced to agree to it.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit hints at some sort of sabotage on Burton's part saying that he went to a PBS executive that WNED was consulting with about their own project and told them it was impossible to do without him his as host, representing that his company RRKids had the ability to tank the project.  Also WNED asked him to take down a youtube series he was putting out with the Reading Rainbow name, afraid that free episodes of content may sour investors to WNED's show.  He refused.  \n\nCombine those actions with him going behind their back to negotiate a deal in the space they'd both agreed to in the 2011 licensing was WNED's purview, which would also probably put an end to their own Reading Rainbow reboot, and there was no way WNED was going to let him negotiate the deal on his own.",

This suit is added to the previous lawsuit they made against him, back in 2014.\n\nIn 2011, they entered a contractual agreement where he would pay them a licensing fee for digital distribution of the show.  He did that for a few years, before doing his Kickstarter to get backing and hype going.  Then he approached Netflix (a digital content distributor) to sign them as the distributor.  \n\nWNED claimed that was a breach of contract, despite any evidence of this, and demanded he pay more in licensing fees, resulting in the 2014 lawsuit.  Because of that suit, he was given a cease and desist of the use of the Reading Rainbow brand, which he complied with, changing his show's name to \"Levar Burton Reads\" and put the licensing agreement on hold.  That suit and this new one is nothing more than some money grubbing ass hats trying to get more money out of him AFTER a contract was already in place and he had been paying it in good faith, because they suddenly saw that he might actually have some success with digital distribution.",

PBS wasn't willing to pay WNED \"several hundred thousand dollars needed to renew the show's broadcast rights\" in 2009, so they cancelled it. \n\nYeah, the whole thing smells like typical rent-seeking bullshit to me.  They may own Reading Rainbow, but the IP is worth exactly diddly without Levar Burton.  Since PBS balked at the rate they were trying to charge, and the main person left who is interested in reviving it is Burton, they're squeezing him as hard as they can to wring the money out of him.",

And it's extremely sad that there's a dispute like this about something as wholesome as Reading Rainbow.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like it's just that he said it off the cuff one time and they just knee-jerk responded with lawyers.  The context and details here is pretty important, and it sounds like it's the latest salvo in an ongoing dispute.\n\nI still think it's dumb, but it's clearly not as simple as that.\n\nEdit:  Plus, if you actually read the lawsuit, it looks like the article is really misleading.  The whole catchphrase thing is just a small part of their complaint.  This is only one side of the story, but looks like it's a lot more complicated than the article implies (this is a much larger business disagreement):\n\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3914510-Burton.html",

Well I don't know about you but the only good will I think about when I think of Reading Rainbow was the obvious love for literature that LeVar shared with an entire generation.   Let's voice our displeasure.    \n\nSend letters, call in, email, anything that shows our support for a man who's just trying to share his love of the written word with the world again.\n\nWNED claims to be a public network, let's show them what the displeasure of the public looks like.   They need to understand that there is no way for LeVar to take advantage of their \"good will\" because when they stand against him, they have none.\n\nNot trying to hurt the public networks, but it just feels a bit bad for them to behave this way.  If they clean things up, they'll have my support back 100%.",

They signed an agreement with him in 2011, where they would make TV shows, and he could do digital stuff with the brand, and they would share the profits. They have been pissed off and trying to kill things ever since the kickstarter. I really don't get why. They were doing NOTHING with the brand, and he was bringing in millions of dollars. Having 100% of something is not any good, if they do not do anything with it to generate money. They would have been better off letting him continue under the agreement.",

Even though WNED had the exclusive right to develop new episodes of the series, RRKidz engaged in extensive discussions with Netflix without WNED\u2019s knowledge. \n&gt; \n&gt; **By the time WNED learned about those discussions, in late September 2014, RRKidz had already negotiated the terms of a development and production deal with Netflix and brought in The Jim Henson** \n&gt; **Company as a producer.**\n\n[RRKidz is the company being sued, was co-founded by Burton, but also Mark Wolfe, a Hollywood producer/studio executive]\n\n**edit:** This is a fun read.

Most televisions do not provide a wide enough dynamic range to always maintain a distinct separation between music and voices. In contrast, program producers and editors work in studios outfitted with the best, high fidelity sound systems, and they balance the voices and music on their programs based on that high fidelity. Many modern TV sets offer controls that may improve your listening experience if you find the music too loud. For example, switching from \u201cstereo\u201d to \u201cmono,\u201d or disabling the \u201csurround sound\u201d feature can often help dampen the low and high frequencies where the music is, which may then allow you to hear the voices more clearly.\n\nOr your production is crap.",

If so, then WNED would't feel the need to assert its rights about what amounts to a little thing. And it is a little thing. That phrase--if it is lined with the show in the minds of anyone--is linked with Burton, rather than the copyright owner. It's worth mentioning, though, that while they might have a case, such a lawsuit is potentially bad for their public image. How do you tell a beloved figure he can't use a phrase simply because he was known for using it on your show? If George Peppard were alive today and used the phrase \"I love it when a plan comes together,\" in a kitschy, nostalgic way on a podcast and NBC/Universal sued him for it, then NBC/Universal would look like a bunch of assholes. They might own it, but he made it famous. The same, I'd say, pertains to Burton. WNED might legitimately have a claim... but is it really in their best interests to flex those muscles so blatantly?",

It should say he's being sued for using the RR IP without permission. But since this news site wanted to get as many clicks as possible, they picked the title that they knew would generate the most controversy, and since most people only read the title, now most people think it's literally because of the catchphrase and nothing else.",

I know many people won't read this or other articles, so here's what I found.\n\nWNED were discussing reviving Reading Rainbow in 2011, and Burton took it upon himself to start the Kickstarter campaign, despite having no legal ownership of the show or anything associated with it. He didn't want to go the legal route, and WNED have been given no choice but to defend what's legally theirs. He was able to get a license to use the name, but not in perpetuity, and with limitations.\n\nI realize this makes me literally Hitler for not defending the little guy against the big corporation, especially when he's such a beloved part of so many childhoods, but let's look at it from another angle. If the big guy had used a band's song and tried to profit from it without having any legal right to do so, would anyone be defending them?\n\nIt sucks how all of this has turned out, but WNED aren't the bad guys here for doing what anyone would've done when their intellectual property was being used illegally.",

The agreement was that WNED would produce new episodes and he would produce digital/web content and that they would split any profits.  He then started the Kickstarter in 2014 as a means to fund digital projects like the Reading Rainbow Skybrary which he followed through on.  Where they got peeved is when he started negotiations with the Jim Henson company and Netflix for a crossover show between IP of both and WNED was left out of the discussions.\n\nAfter this, WNED informed RRKidz that they had breached the licensing agreement and had to cease immediately.  RRKidz requested that a federal judge declare that they had performed fully under and had not violated the agreement. WNED filed counter claims and that shit is still ongoing.  Now WNED filed a lawsuit over the use of a phrase that is not trademarked as a slogan and they aren't even claiming trademark violation because they know it is not a slogan.  They just threw in all the other garbage allegations hoping SOMETHING will stick legally. \n\n",

His use of the catch phrase is just one piece of evidence to support their claim. I don't know if the suit will go anywhere, but it's much more than just a trademark suit over the use of one catch phrase from the show.\n\nEDIT: For anyone still in rage mode, I strongly encourage you to read the original article this clickbaity article was written from. It gives at lot of additional context to show why WNED is suing Burton, especially the following full \"goodwill\" quote:\n\n&gt;\"As evidenced by Mr. Burton\u2019s conduct since he began 'teasing' the public about the return of Reading Rainbow years before his company acquired any rights to do so, Mr. Burton\u2019s goal is to control and reap the benefits of Reading Rainbow\u2019s substantial goodwill \u2014 goodwill that unquestionably belongs to WNED,\" states the complaint. \"First, defendants tried to assert control over the brand through deception: secret negotiations with Netflix, false assertions of ownership of the RR Intellectual Property, and misleading efforts to persuade WNED\u2019s business associates to make Mr. Burton the host of any new series. Then, defendants tried brute force: the RRKIDZ Action, through which they tied up the RR Intellectual Property while waging a war of attrition intended to extract a settlement that would loosen restrictions of their ability to exploit the RR Intellectual Property. Now that WNED has called their bluff and is prepared to take the RRKIDZ Action to trial, defendants have resorted to theft and extortion. As the RRKIDZ Action moved closer to trial, RRKidz began working with Mr. Burton\u2019s longtime friend, John Raymonds, to secretly encumber the RR Intellectual Property as collateral for $2.5 million in loans from Raymonds Capital.\"\n\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/reading-rainbow-owner-accuses-levar-burton-theft-extortion-lawsuit-1027372",

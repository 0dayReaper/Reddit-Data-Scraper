    "postText": "I've thought about it a lot as in my short time I've experienced a fair amount. The one that comes to me right away is \"I ate the frog, it wasn't so bad\".\nI love the quote from Mark Twain \"If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.\"\n\nDefinitely something I've  been working to live by. It doesn't always apply, but enough so that I've become fond of it. \n\nI'm curious if anyone else has a title that suits then.",

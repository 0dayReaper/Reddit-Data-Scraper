    "postText": "\n\"Now let's take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.\"  \n\n\"Yes, but what about the firemen, then?\" asked Montag.  \n\n\"Ah.\" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. \"What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you, Montag, and that's me.\"",

Nineteenth-century man with his horses, dogs, carts, slow motion. Then, in the Twentieth Century, speed up your camera. Books cut shorter. Condensations. Digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to the gag, the snap ending. Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten- or twelve-line dictionary resume. I exaggerate, of course. The dictionaries were for reference. But many were those whose sole knowledge of Hamlet\u2026 was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: \u2018now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbours.\u2019 Do you see? Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there\u2019s your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more.\u201d\n\nEverything condensed to 140 characters\n\nEdit: Apologies everyone, 280 characters :)",

I interned for a Congressman a few years ago while I was in college and I was honestly surprised at how much Members of the House cared about their constituents' feedback. There were certainly party line votes, and votes where the Congressman felt like he was doing the right thing even if it wasn't popular, but they were the minority. \n\nMost Members, unless they are in horrendously gerrymandered seats, need all the votes they can get, so they listen to their constituents. The interns would take all calls and emails and record them in a program that tallied up responses for and against whatever bill; that was taken seriously when it was time to vote. Decisions are made by people who show up. If you call or email, you probably vote, so the Members care a whole lot about whether you like what they do. If you do nothing but complain on the internet, they don't give any more fucks than you apparently do.",

This slavery business is awful, someone should do something.\" And then they'd go back to reading their newspaper, and in Thoreau's view, that made them complicit in allowing slavery to continue, regardless of their opinion.\n\nHe was an idealist and impractical in a lot of ways, but by setting a high bar for personal political activism he also inspired some of the best activists. I'm not someone who \"poo-poos\" slacktivism - such as people using their voice online to support a cause or persuade others - it's the first step to many powerful forms of political engagement and any form of \"gatekeeping\" when it comes to political participation is really not part of our Democratic values and aspirations (even if we frequently fall short). I'm referring to the US as \"our\", but my comments applies to the UK as well, which has a very deep well of democratic values that are part of its cultural history - a history much older than America's - and to other liberal democracies and republics.",

He writes:\n\nWhat Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny \"failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.\" In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that our fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.\n\n\n--Journalist Christopher Hitchens, who himself published several articles on Huxley and a book on Orwell, noted the difference between the two texts in the introduction to his 1999 article \"Why Americans Are Not Taught History\":\n\nWe dwell in a present-tense culture that somehow, significantly, decided to employ the telling expression \"You're history\" as a choice reprobation or insult, and thus elected to speak forgotten volumes about itself. By that standard, the forbidding dystopia of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four already belongs, both as a text and as a date, with Ur and Mycenae, while the hedonist nihilism of Huxley still beckons toward a painless, amusement-sodden, and stress-free consensus. Orwell's was a house of horrors. He seemed to strain credulity because he posited a regime that would go to any lengths to own and possess history, to rewrite and construct it, and to inculcate it by means of coercion. Whereas Huxley ... rightly foresaw that any such regime could break because it could not bend. In 1988, four years after 1984, the Soviet Union scrapped its official history curriculum and announced that a newly authorized version was somewhere in the works. This was the precise moment when the regime conceded its own extinction. For true blissed-out and vacant servitude, though, you need an otherwise sophisticated society where no serious history is taught.",

I frequently think about how alone all of us truly are in the grand scheme of things but despite that humanity seems drawn to eachother. \n\nI recently experienced the first funeral of a close family member I have been to and I was taken aback by how many people ended up showing up to support my grieving mother. On one hand it could just be because my mother is a saint but on the other hand it felt very empathetic and abnormal. This was one of the saddest times my family had been through in recent years but yet the kinship I felt with almost total strangers that day was palpable.\n\nAs to why I brought this up, I'm not entirely sure. I think that being placed in extremely \"outside of your bubble\" situations lends wholistic growth as a person. While some of these experiences may not be pleasant (ie, a funeral) you come out a wiser person because of it. \n\nI think the most important part of all of this is to not dwell on the sadness and isolation but possibly channel it.\n\nI suppose I better end this comment now before I ramble any more but thanks for inspiring some thinking with your comment :)",

NKVD agents betrayed the regiment Orwell was in and it cost the lives of his comrades.\n\n1984 was not a prediction, it was a defamation of Stalin's sectarianism against other types of communists and the way he ran the Soviet Union, Orwell's revenge. He hated Marxist-Leninists so much that on his deathbed, Orwell wrote on a piece of paper the names of multiple Marxist-Leninists and gave it to the British police. ",

Our political situation should be a pretty obvious example. At the same time, people are constantly plugged in to this stream of news, entertainment, music, and video. I see mothers on the bus staring at their phones while their children sit unhappily next to them. I see gross inaccuracies stated on websites and social media, but people don't care to correct it. It's not simply that they don't want to be offended; rather, they want to stay in their own, isolated bubble. \n\n&gt;His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of the tomb, her eyes fixed in the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming in, coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward morning. There had been no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down in it for the third time.\n\nPeople aren't putting down books because they're offended. Certainly, there is the occasional attempt to ban Mark Twain or \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" but these are by and large very rare incidents. People aren't picking up books because they'd rather stare at their TVs or phones, they'd rather be plugged into the latest music, or sports game, or drama on TV. Whether is true or not, or offensive, seems not to matter.\n\nedit: typos\n",

Unfortunately, that's only served to underscore how woefully ill-equipped we remain in selecting the optimal solution. \n\nThat part hasn't been addressed -- and probably never will be.

I've always thought that if it's, like, easy, and you just want a person with PTSD or something to be relaxed when they're reading and not constantly on guard, you might as well stick a few content warnings on there. But I absolutely see the concern with classification becoming a way for conservative people (and I use the word conservative in a \"traditional values\" sense) to restrict access to works that might have really important discussions about sexuality, violence, youth, race, etc. So I was thinking, if you're reading, as opposed to watching a movie or something, most of the time you'd hopefully be able to tell when something is about to get into dangerous territory and skip a few pages.

The goal in treatment is to not be triggered into flashbacks from things you see and hear every day. Of course, being triggered is not at all comfortable, but acknowledging the emotion/reaction is much more helpful in the long run than complete avoidance, which can make a reaction stronger and more debilitating. \n\nI was on medical disability for 2 years because my reactions were so strong and managing trigger reactions was a primary force of treatment during that time. I personally believe that excessive trigger warnings can be detrimental to PTSD recovery. While the intentions of trigger warnings are out of respect and kindness, they also enable mental instability and hinder complete recovery. \n\nEditing to answer your question more: When triggered it medically means you have a flashback or dissociate (with PTSD). It\u2019s not really \u201cgetting upset.\u201d I find that \u201ctriggered\u201d is greatly overused, especially online. \n\nA flashback throws you right back into the trauma. Sometimes you aren\u2019t even aware of the world around you. They are extremely intrusive memories/thoughts and your mind and body can react like you are back in that traumatic experience. \n\nWith dissociation, it\u2019s more like slipping into a coma. Some really intense memory or feeling can just cause you to shut down. You can lose consciousness or even continue actions without consciously being \u201cawake.\u201d \n\nAgain, as someone who has suffered from PTSD, I find \u201ctriggers\u201d overused and detrimental. They are misused by individuals who do not have PTSD and can hinder treatment (or cause someone not even to seek treatment) in those who do. \n\n",

He couldn't have foreseen reality shows and their affect on the West. (Hell, people voted for the current American president because they recognized him from acting in a reality TV show.)

That there is a gray middle ground isn't considered an acceptable alternative.\n\n&gt;We are existing in a very simplistic, unchallenging culture where exposure to new ideas gets paradoxically less common as access to different viewpoints gets easier and easier, and that's troubling.\n\nInteresting point.  It almost sounds like the freedom of choice paradox.  When faced with a large number of alternatives people either freeze up or they double down on their standard and stick with it.

They once called in the national guard because black people attempted to attend a college, and the idea of having a woman doctor was mortifying, as was a black person using the same bathroom as you. Interracial couples were blasphemous transgressions.\n\nThis narrative is stupid, and should stop. Society is likely less sensitive now than ever, it's just what it is sensitive too has shifted. ",

The medium in the 1950's was simple, sanitized, and censored and with its rising popularity it was beginning to replace books, a medium in comparison that was far more depth and almost limitless ability in terms of what you could address or describe, it was concerning to Bradbury. The thing is American television has only become more and more unrestricted in content and complexity. In fact basically our whole society has become more free and open to complex and challenging works of art in the visual realm. Sure we are sensitive to things that might be offensive but at least it seems a hell of a lot more focused on things that actually may cause damage to people, like also there is a lot more of this concern seems to be just criticism and not calling for bans of shit.

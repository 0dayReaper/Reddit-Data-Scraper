    "postText": "Johnny Got His Gun is a war story, an atypical anti-war novel about the result of a young man going off to war in 1918.  It is unflinching and devastating. \n\nTaking place within the mind of our narrator Joe Bonham we get flashbacks to his pre war self, brief glimpses at combat, and most of all we get the stream-of-consciousness thoughts of a man trapped inside a prison that war created.  \n\nIt\u2019s a moving novel that will leave you thinking long after you finish it.  It will make you reconsider notions such as liberty, freedom, decency, patriotism, and democracy.  It\u2019s a powerful novel that does one of the most powerful things a novel can do.  It makes you re-examine your beliefs.",

The author set himself an incredible challenge for conveying the narrator's perspective \u2013 not unlike the author of Flowers for Algernon \u2013 and pulled it off, not just flawlessly, but with immense power. His personal history of being blackballed in Hollywood only adds to the weight of the story he elected to tell.",

He didn't want the US fighting the Nazis, because he was a Stalinist who supported Stalin's non-aggression pact with Hitler -- and then had the book pulled when that pact was broken:\n\n&gt;Serialized in the Daily Worker in March 1940, published by the Communist Party USA to which Trumbo belonged, the book became \"a rally point for the political left\" which had **opposed involvement in World War II** during the period of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact (1939-1941) when **the USSR maintained a non aggression pact with Nazi Germany**. Shortly after the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, Trumbo and his publishers decided to suspend reprinting the book until the end of the war, due to the Communist Party USA's support for the war so long as the US was allied with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany.\n\nOr to put it another way, it's not really an anti-war novel, it's pro-totalitarian propaganda.",

When I read Johnny Got His Gun I read it as war literature.  \n\nBut I also think there\u2019s discussion to be had on the context the author wrote the work in but I think this book is a perfect example of where I view that as a separate discussion.  \n\nThe novel discussed as war literature vs. war propaganda would be an interesting read.",

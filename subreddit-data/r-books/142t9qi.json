    "postText": "It's all well to have a favourite book, but what about your favourite scene? What are some scenes in novels that you still think about constantly, or that resonated with you deeply? Or perhaps, just felt startlingly real, and really moved you?\n\nMy favourite scene of all time is the wedding scene in Anna Karenina--Levin and Kitty are in church, and about to be wed. In short, it's an extremely beautiful depiction of marriage. Levin is very conscious that his life is about to change forever, but despite his anxiety, his love for Kitty in that scene is just so joyous, so pure. I love Levin partly because I'm just incredibly moved at how deeply and openly he loves Kitty. It's a very innocent love too, which makes sense, because Kitty is just eighteen. (I know Levin's over 30, I'm ignoring that part!) But the openness and kindness of Levin's soul is something very unique; no other book can rival how intimate the narrative feels.\n\nThroughout it all, he desperately wants to know what Kitty, his bride, is thinking and feeling. He feels marriage is such a solemn, strange thing that even under the wedding canopy--he can't quite comprehend its mystery. Though I have my reservations about marriage as an institution, the solemn beauty of the scene is enough to make me want to get married tomorrow. ",

Terror was beginning to grip him again. There was no sound save the rap of his feet, which seemed to grow to an echoing noise, like the slapping of great hands upon the stones. The dead bodies; the emptiness; the dank black walls that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the fear of sudden death lurking in doorway or shadow; and behind all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the gate: it was almost more than he could screw himself to face. He would have welcomed a fight - with not too many enemies at a time \u2013 rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to think of Frodo, lying bound or in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place. He went on. He had passed beyond the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at the end of the passage, the inner side of the under gate, as he rightly guessed, when there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek. He stopped short. Then he heard feet coming. Someone was running in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead. His will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the chain and clutched the Ring. But Sam did not put it on; for even as he clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark opening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more than six paces from him when, lifting its head, it saw him; and Sam could hear its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword: it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the wavering light behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very light of which was a bitter pain, the other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed some nameless menace of power and doom. For a moment the orc crouched, and then with a hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had come. Never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned tail than Sam at this unexpected flight. With a shout he gave chase. 'Yes! The Elf-warrior is loose!' he cried. 'I'm coming.'",

Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.\n\nThe formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\n\nWhen the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.\u201d",

As a reader, you already know that there are questions about Wickham's character, but she hasn't admitted them to herself yet. It's so clever, and funny and sardonic, and yet charged with emotion. He is fully expecting her answer to be 'yes' - when she refuses him he cannot believe it, and he is passionately angry at this. She is so overcome by the intensity of the occasion that she cries for half an hour out of 'actual weakness'. Not like her at all. It's so skilfully done.",

            "comment": "Like some other posters, I choose a scene from *The Lord of the Rings*. But it is one that hasn't been mentioned yet: a stunning turn of events at the bleakest hour (when defeat in the crucial battle seems imminent). At this moment, as the good guys are already being overmatched, a fleet of the enemy's ships is sighted, nearing the battlefield. But shockingly -- as you will see in this scene -- the ships actually carry the main hero and his allies.\n\nI love the way Tolkien infuses this scene with energy and imagery.\n\n---\n\nStern now was Eomer's mood, and his mind clear again. He let blow the horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither; for he thought to make a great shield-wall at the last, and stand, and fight there on foot till all fell, and do deeds of song on the fields of Pelennor, though no man should be left in the West to remember the last King of the Mark. So he rode to a green hillock and there set his banner, and the White Horse ran rippling in the wind.\n\n*Out of doubt, out of dark to the day's rising*\n\n*I came singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.*\n\n*To hope's end I rode and to heart's breaking:*\n\n*Now for wrath, now for ruin and a red nightfall!*\n\nThese staves he spoke, yet he laughed as he said them. For once more lust of battle was on him; and he was still unscathed, and he was young, and he was king: the lord of a fell people. And lo! even as he laughed at despair he looked out again on the black ships, and he lifted up his sword to defy them.\n\nAnd then wonder took him, and a great joy; and he cast his sword up in the sunlight and sang as he caught it. And all eyes followed his gaze, and behold! upon the foremost ship a great standard broke, and the wind displayed it as she turned towards the Harlond. There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but Seven Stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought of mithril and gold.\n\nThus came Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elessar, Isildur's heir, out of the Paths of the Dead, borne upon a wind from the Sea to the kingdom of Gondor; and the mirth of the Rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of swords, and the joy and wonder of the City was a music of trumpets and a ringing of bells. But the hosts of Mordor were seized with bewilderment, and a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled with their foes; and a black dread fell on them, knowing that the tides of fate had turned against them and their doom was at hand.",

Is that a good name? It\u2019ll do \u2026 perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I\u2019ve found out what it\u2019s for.

I can can really thrash it about pretty good can\u2019t I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn\u2019t seem to achieve very much but I\u2019ll probably find out what it\u2019s for later on. Now \u2013 have I built up any coherent picture of things yet?\n\nNo.\n\nNever mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I\u2019m quite dizzy with anticipation \u2026\n\nOr is it the wind?\n\nThere really is a lot of that now isn\u2019t it?\n\nAnd wow! Hey! What\u2019s this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like \u2026 ow \u2026 ound \u2026 round \u2026 ground! That\u2019s it! That\u2019s a good name \u2013 ground!\n\nI wonder if it will be friends with me?\n\nAnd the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.\n\nCuriously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again.

First he demands it, \u201cYou must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.\u201d Victor is hostile and says he shall never consent, no matter what tragedies may befall him. Then the Creature tries to reason with him, \u201cI am malicious because I am miserable. [\u2026] If I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear\u201d. He goes on \u201cI intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind!\u201d \n\nFor a second Victor seems to be moved by the Creature\u2019s speech, \u201cDid I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?\u201d he wonders, and rightly so, because he\u2019s a petulant little shit who bit off more than he could chew and now suddenly doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for his actions. It goes on, but you get the gist. This whole scene is filled with such raw emotion, unabridged desperation from a Creature that never asked to be put in this world in the first place and that, after facing the rejection from his \u201cfather\u201d, all he asks of him is for him to ease his loneliness a little, to be granted a morsel of the love - or at least compassion - that has been so cruelly denied to him for no reason other than the way in which he exists, the body which he inhabits. Both things that he had no say in. \n\nI think it is a spectacular book where every word carries its weight, but that particular chapter moves me to my core. \n\nNot Victor though; I hate that guy.",

One of the leaves is thanking the other for being kind and is cut off mid-sentence as she falls from the tree to the ground, signalling the start of winter.

The point of view shifts from the characters we have been following thus far in the book to a random soldier, who is then killed, and the PoV switches to their killer, who is then killed, and so on and so forth. This goes on for a while and we follow quite a few characters who all meet a bad end.\n\nThen it switches to Gorst. He is one of the main characters and an exceptionally skilled fighter who trains excessively every day. He has faced scorn and humiliation his entire life because he was born with a very high pitched 'girly' sounding voice. He has suffered constant failures and humiliations throughout the series, despite being possibly the best fighter in the world.\n\nJoe Abercrombies readers are well aware that having a main character randomly die in the first clash of the battle is not out of the question, and everyone else in the chapter so far has met a grisly end.\n\nBut Gorst isn't like everyone else. He trains until exhaustion every day with weighted swords. He has no real friends, no wife, no real prospects for advancement. All he has in his entire life is fighting, and in a chapter where every other character is killed, he does the killing instead and finally finds a place where he belongs.",

Thufir started to struggle to stand because of a poison and showed Paul the poison needle and said \u201cDid you think that I who\u2019ve given my life to service of the Atreides would give them less now?\u201d. His death right after made me really sad for reasons I don\u2019t know.!&lt;",
